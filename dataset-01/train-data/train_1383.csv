4,Great book about how we shouldn't mess with God's plan,This book kept me intrusted and wanting to read more I don't read much because I can't find a book that keeps me not from falling asleep or my mind wandering. I liked how she died in the end just to twist the knife a little deeper.
1,Don't use this company!,"Don't use this company! I paid extra for expidited service, and didn't get it any sooner than regular post. The quality of the book wasn't what was listed in the add...Over 50 pages were highlighted, notes written in the margin, and pages bent and folded. Horrible. I wouldn't use them again or recommend them!"
1,ICKY,"UMMM CAN WE SAY ""SUCKY"" ? SORRY, BUT THIS BOOK DID NOT ENTERTAIN ME AT ALL, I THOUGHT IT WAS NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD CALL ""HORROR"" WICH IS WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.. I THOUGHT IT WAS SAD AND PATHETIC"
4,Frankenstein: A Norton Critical Edicition,"This book is based on the original 1818 version of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, but is geared toward the reader who wants a more in-depth knowledge and understanding of this work of fiction and the writings of Mary Shelley, her husband Percy Shelley, Lord Byron and Dr. John William Polidori, Byron's friend. The reader will find abundant annotations which help to explain the context in which it was written. A map is provided which helps to locate many of the settings described in the book. It also includes a section of reactions to various versions that have been published. Twelve contemporary authors have submitted essays which supply a variety of perspectives on Frankenstein. The book offers an authoritative text, contextual and source materials, and a wide range of interpretations in addition to a bibliography of other works on the topics."
5,Needed for college.,"My daughter needed this for a class. Price was cheaper than the book store and came straight away. When my daughter is finished with it, I may read. Just watched the movie made from this book and loved it."
3,"The book is good, but it could be better in many ways","This book has many brand names which I found very helpful. However, in the back is a restaurant/fast food section. I'm in California and many of the restaurants/fast food places listed have no locations here so they were irrelevant to me. Also, my favorite, Del Taco, wasn't listed."
4,"Pretty Good, if you like immunology","Great pics and diagrams. If you are an immuno fan you will injoy it. Personally I don't like the subject. Easy to read book, but could use more beginners notes."
4,Happy WIth It,"I'm happy with it. I think the DVD is appropriately titled. Well worth the money. I've purchased or reviewed close to 100 dance DVDs. Initially, over a year ago, when I started dancing and buying dance DVDs; I was extremely unhappy with Teresa Masons DVDs. They were too difficult for me to follow. Now, after learning the very basics of dance, I've pretty much purchased all of hers for under $12.00 each. Reason: I think ""Most bang for the Buck"" if you buy them as cheaply as possible."
4,Another beautiful hatchling,"As a fan since the first record in 1981, every time this band releases something there is a fair reason to celebrate this is in no way a lesser party. I give this a 4 because it is still better then anything most people will ever put out but still comes second to the first 3 Peni releases, or two rleases if one is counting the first two EPs as one (which is how it was issued on CD).Archaic is in the same league as Underclass and Echo's. It is a straight ahead kill shot with out fattty loose ends. There are no loopy moments here and the band still sounds as disturbed and gristled as ever. Anyone who likes the last two outings by Rudimentary Peni will like this one."
4,Live is hot,Even tho I brought this CD when it first came out...in 95 i believe...I still dust it off and listen to it every now and again. I think it is far superior to anything they've done since. The song 'I Alone' still gives me chills. Good for singing at the top of your lungs in the car when youre alone!
5,"this is a great cd, definatly live's best cd","This is a great cd, definatly live's best cd, their other cd's are very good too, but this one is great. This is just one of those cd's that I could listen to whatever mood i am in. The best tracks have to be -- lightning crashes, i alone, iris, selling the drama-- all of the songs are must listen songs. It is one of those records that when you listen to it, you have to smile."
4,Never Gets Old!,"Till' this day I think Live's ""Lightning Crashes"" will remain a hit that once people will mention the title, others will automatically Know it. Their whole ""throwing Copper"" cd is great, only a few songs I don't listen to on a regular basis."
5,This CD enhances musical intelligence.,"Live is one of the best bands out these days. If anyone would like to here music worth listening to, GET THIS CD! Throwing Copper is an album to live by, and an inspirational movement. We should all play quallity music like like these 4 talented guys. Someone should kiss them all for bringing good music back into the world!"
5,It rocks!,"I was exposed to LIVE when Lightening Crashes became popular, but I have to admit that the rest of is even better. I think this is a must have in a CD collection."
3,"Good, but pretty depressing","Be sure to listen to the samples. I think the music is good and I listen to it in rotation with others. The few times that I listened to the album all by itself, I was pretty bummed. The music is pretty dark overall, but still good. I am talking about the music and not necessarily the lyrics. I think you get a pretty good idea of this from the samples."
5,Incredible,"Throwing Copper is the best album ever written, by anyone. There's not a single track that isn't fantastic. Kowalcyk's melodies are amazing, and his lyrics are deep and meaningful, but not too preachy. Songs range from the slow and thoughtful ""Pillars of Davidson"", to the hard, fast paced ""Stage"". And of course this albums delivers classics like ""Lightning Crashes"", ""I Alone"", ""Selling The Drama"", and ""All Over You"". A must have for any music fan"
5,Live is great...and so much more,"Live is my favorite band and I am always in awe of their amazing talent. The lyrics on this album can be somewhat cryptic, but that's the fun part. It makes you think. I highly recommend this album. And if you don't like it the first time, listen to it again, and again if you have to. Check out their other 2 albums....plus their new one which comes out October 5th!"
5,Good CD,"I just recently heard music from Live. After ""Lightning Crashes"" and ""I Alone"" I fell in love with them. This CD never stops with its mellower rock tunes. I totally recommend it to anyone no matter what type of music you listen to."
5,Great stuff!,"Like I said in my other review of this band (under A Distance To Here) this band is great! Their lyrics are like poetry and they play well. Surely a pleasure to listen to. The CD is good all the way threw and there are many songs to relate to, if you concentrate on what they mean. If you like good alternitive/rock, this is something you shouldn't miss!"
4,A Fine Album...,"Not to be overlooked. BUT, whatever possessed Live NOT to have Hold Me Up included I will never understand. This awesome, missing track could have carried it all on its own."
5,Live at it's best.,"I love this CD. It is Live at it's best, and I can't get enough of it. Even after listening to so, so, SO many times it still sounds great. Anybody who likes alternitive rock needs to buy it. It is well worth the money. The best songs are ""I Alone"" and ""Lightning Crashes""."
3,One of those classic mid-90's albums.,"This is one of several albums that for me define, musically, my last two years of high school. Maybe the songs on Throwing Copper don't mean so much to me anymore(except in a nostalgic sort of way), but this is good music to make you feel a bit more powerful when you're feeling angsty . . . in other words, good teen music -- and something you have to have if you're assembling a 90's collection."
2,Way too overrated,"Live used to be one of my favorite bands, and then I REALLY listened to them. ""Throwing Copper"" is not the great album everyone says it is. First of all, not only do most of the songs painfully drag on (Pillar of Davidson and White, Discussion are both over 6 minutes of torture!) but most of the songs sound nearly the same. Live has publicly discussed the fact that they are rather unschooled musicians, and it shows. Live has said in interviews that they just learned their instruments by the seat of their pants. If you are a person that has any ear for the technical aspects of music at all, you will realize that this album sounds almost like one big, giagantic song. I think this album does not live up to the hype at all. And what was so great about the song ""Lightning Crashes?"" That song is 3 chords repeated over and over for five minutes! You call that genius? I think not! Check out their first album, ""Mental Jewelry"" It's SO much better!"
2,phony & pretentious,"I agree with the other negative reviewer here that ""Throwing Copper"" is full of ""fake emotion."" I used to like this CD, especially of course ""Lightning Crashes,"" but the pretentious melodrama in every song makes some of them almost unbearable. There is also an unfortunate tendency for the signal to blur into what could be aptly termed white noise, especially on the opening track, at the most ""dramatic"" and ""emotional"" moments. In fact, the sound isn't that good, period (just listen to ""White, Discussion"" - ugh), and combined with the irritating vocals, there's nothing to recommend this album for any serious music fan, even ""Lightning Crashes."" BTW, the mediocrity of that song is exposed when you hear a live version of it."
2,There is nothing quite like the sound of selling out!,Anyone who buys this CD falls for clever marketing tricks by the Music Industry. I find their change in image just a little to hard to swallow. It's funny how their change corresponded to what was selling in the music world at the time. This CD is filled with cliche lyrics and music. It's filled with radio friendly songs that are filled with insultingly poor attempts at meaningful statements. Don't fall for it! Save your money for something genuine!
2,Not too bad but doesn't catch my fancy,I got this CD for Christmas one year and I thought it was a damn good one. But when I started buying heavier albums from other groups I lost interest in it. It's not a bad album but it's not something I would listen to a million times since I like a lot of the heavier metal. The reason why i don't like it that much is because compared to all my other thrash and death metal albums I have it softens it. It just doesn't cater to me.
1,Overblown melodrama and fake emotion,"This is the most pretentious and just downright awful band to come down the pike in some time. Every word on this album rings hollow. Probably because every word is delivered with such annoying ""emotion"". Of course it's not real emotion. It's the kind that's much more popular. The kind that looks good on Mtv. The kind where the singer furrows his brow, holds his arms to the heavens, and ROCKS. Because he wants you to ""feel it man"". This is just insulting. A meaningless band with meaningless songs, trying VERY hard to mean something. Maybe if I was fourteen years old and wanted to pretend that my life was sooo difficult..."
1,Uggh!,"I bought this album after liking the singles""iris"" and ""lightning crashes."" Talk about misleading. They are the only good cuts. Don't pay full price for this."
4,An Enjoyable Album,"There are some great songs on this album. Only complaint is that the lead singer continually verges on pretentious whining. The lyrics aren't particularly impressive, some of which are nonsensical. But I've consistently enjoyed this album since first purchasing it over 10 years ago, definitely worth buying."
3,LIVE's CLASSIC!!!,"Throwing Copper is Live's classic! All the songs are good, with some 90's classics like I ALONE, ALL OVER YOU and LIGHTNING CRASHES! Throwing Copper and Mental Jewelry are Live's finest moments, and Secret Samadhi is good too."
5,Live is just a great band....,From the first time I heard them I thought they were a great band and I still think so today. Good basic rock and roll never gets to old.Jeff
3,it broke,"I got it because my car only plays cassettes. It worked good for about 2 weeks but all of the sudden broke. I'm a little ticked off by this, but then again it's pretty old."
5,A Perfect Sample of an AWESOME Band!!,"I hold this album dear to me for not only the music, but the emotions attached to it. I began my love for this band with the beautiful ""Lightning Crashes"", and immediately +Live+ was my favourite band. And has been ever since. This particular album of theirs shows the band members' ability to attach to Edward Kowalczyk's lyrics a perfect understanding of his emotions. It's powerfully deep, mysterious lyrics bring new conclusions to their meanings every time you hear them. The musicality of the songs could not be better. And anything that needs to be said, is said in this album. In one word, AWESOME!! :)"
5,sunshine in my eye,"I have to say that when I first heard ""I Alone"" on MTV back in 95 I believe, I really didn't like the song at all. I was 25, and really into metal bands like Sepultura, Metallica, Megadeth and so forth. Yet by the grace of God a girl friend of one of my friends had the ""cassette"" if you believe that, and I was bored one day so I thought I'd check it out for the hell of it. First listen I immediately noticed the song Iris. Hell yeah this song rocks! And this coming from a metalhead no less. So thankfully for that one song, I gave the rest of the album a chance. Fast forward 11 years. Here I am, owning all of their albums and am a devoted fan. Go figure. lol. One other thing I have to mention, this is my favortie cd to listen to while driving around on a pleasant sunny day. I have not yet found a cd comparable to this one in that respect."
1,Do Not Buy - Defective Rope Ladder,"Bought this swingset a few years back. While my kids have fun on it, one has to be very careful. The rope ladder is not made to withstand weather. Every year I have to replace the ladder, as it seems to break where the ropes slide through the wood. This creates an unsafe condition, as any children climbing can be hurt. This will also result in you having to spend $60 every year for a new rope ladder. This is not a part that one can easily take off and store away. When reported this defective condition to Little Tikes, they did not care as the rope ladder is not warrantied. My advice to all is to stay away from this product and buy one that will last more than one year."
5,Excellent quality,"While the directions were a bit challenging to follow (suggestion-have a consumer, not the tech geek, write them), the playset was assembled in a relatively short time. It looks terrific and is of superior quality. The only problem is now our little guy wants a trampoline to complete his ""park""!"
2,Buy the DVD instead!!,"I think that the choice of music on this CD is poor in comparison with what they had to choose from at the festival. The selections on the CD are few in number and shallow in depth. One would have thought that with four very long days of music to choose from, they could have come up with more tracks and better choices. The DVD has better music and as a bonus you get to sit right in front of these great musicians as they play and get a real feel for the wonderful personalities behind the music. Better yet....make the pilgrimage to Telluride and endure the hail and rain and brutal sun. It's worth it every year!"
1,I can break it with my eyes,"The goal arrived at my house assembled wrong, then after it was fixed be me, I successfully put it together, which was relativly easy. After several moderately hard training sessions two large holes were in the net. That is on top of the fact that the pins that hold the net together are weak. The weakness in the pins causes the goal to collapse if there is a shot off of the post. Overall, this is probably not a good buy."
5,Revealing God's Treasure,"I am aware that these findings were from as far back as the 1980s, but having these documented is great to show other people. Those in my life that are skeptical as to the bible being real."
3,I didn't really enjoy it...,I didn't really like this book... she goes to The Big Apple not even knowing if he still lives there. The grandma can't even think for herself!!! Get real!!!
3,antnous: his portraits in their context,"This book by Raffaele Mambella is a brief summary of what is generally known about Antinous, but spread in specialized publications or older books available at best in large libraries : his (thin) biography, the town Antinoopolis, his obelisk, and the historical and cultural context in which he lived. A large part of the book consists in a catalogue of his portraits (quite incomplete, in fact). A rather comprehensive site about portraits of Antinous is to be found at: http://home.snafu.de/ruedden/antinoos/antinoos.htm. The most interesting part (although controversial) may be the one about the history of a statuette kept today in Berlin (Altes Museum, R.56), pp. 87-99. The bibliography (pp.293-4) is a bit short, but includes most of the major works on this subject. Abundantly illustrated; alas the photos are generally of poor quality. Anyway, it is pleasant to read."
4,This book is both a friend and a coach,"Mother Nurture is a must-read for all new mums (and dads). It feels like having a friend, coach, and doctor talking with you. The collaboration of 3 professionals has led to a truly holistic approach to guiding mothers as they embark upon (yes it's cliche but true) ""the most difficult and rewarding"" job in life. There's lots of specific, straight-forward, take action suggestions along with helpful anecdotes to illustrate points. I found this book to be of great comfort, inspiration, and help."
4,Dave Angel - Tokyo Stealth Fighter,"You'd expect a track titled TOKYO STEALTH FIGHTER to be futuristic and awesome, and, really, it is. On this remix package, Dave Clarke goes deeper, bringing the video game noises right into the breakdown. Slam, in their appropriately titled ""Conflicting Beats Mix,"" goes from breaks to beats with little pauses in the segues to indicate the change. Carl Craig, true to form, delivers a long, extended groove, full of background hissing and growls, and that tricks you into thinking it's over halfway through. Oh, that crafty Carl Craig..."
4,slick and functional,"This iPod case is exactly what I wanted. It's a tad too small for the 80GB iPod, so part of the screen is obscured by the case, but that woudn't deter me from buying it again."
3,Not as expected,"The quality of material is not good. It is cheap plastic that will break easily. Will move forward and reverse, no right or left movement."
2,Not what I expected!,"I was looking for what was printed on the DVD jacket... building bridges between faith groups and cultures. I wanted to learn about the many religions in our country and neighborhoods, hoping for a montage of videos and dialouges of cultures, places and people. Instead, the 4 disc DVD is primarily a lecture from one man in front of a chalk board, outling aspects of each religion. That was dissapointing enough. Another dissapointment, was that the Adventist Mission had motives to build bridges, and that was to convert the very peoples of other religions! It was my mistake to purchase this product produced from the Adventist Mission.org. I'll search better in the future. My way of building bridges is to respect other cultures and get along with those different from me!"
5,Excellent Book for Family Reading Time,"Each evening we choose from a stack of favorite books to read with our boys (one 12, two 10). This book quickly became their favorite, requested above all others. The boys connected with many of the stories and the themes were great launching points for discussion on our own family experiences. Having finished that book, I was happy to find another Gary Stanley book, ""What My Dog Has Taught Me..."", which we added to our book collection this last month (another favorite). This author has a knack for sharing simple life stories with spiritual parallels -- and, at the end of a long day, his stories make ""family reading time"" a thoughtful and interesting experience for three active, young boys."
4,Facts to Focus On,"Carl Oglesby was very skilled at picking out the details that were most startling for this FACTion packed book. It is very short, yet Oglesby gives you concise lists to follow throughout so that you do not get bogged down with information. His opinion is stated, but he leaves room for interpretation either way for the reader."
4,Unique,Very interesting and unique product. I'm always hunting for unique outdoor furniture and deck stuff. I plan to preorder now.
1,"Claytie and the Lady, needs improvement!","This book covers a great topic that hasn't been addressed in published materials very much. But, it needs some re-writing to be more readable. The first chapter in particular is poorly done. Chapters 2-4 are better, and again 5 is poorly done. The authors attempt to explain the role of gender during the 1990 gubernatorial elections in Texas. At many times, they sound just as confused as the elections were that year. Their general conclusion is that Ann Richards won because Claytie lost! That is probably an accurate conclusion, but their material that attempts to show the role of gender rambles, and does not just get to the point. Please edit and re-publish!"
3,"Not sugar and spice, but still pretty nice!","Washington DC based photgrapher Fehl Cannon has a pretty good eye for the male body, and he puts that to good use here. The leather based photography is leather-light; if you're looking for super hard core action it's not part of ""Eye Candy II."" But the models are handsome and somewhat exotic, are dressed in more fetish than circuit boy attire, and given interesting backdrops. This makes a fine introduction to a photographer on the rise, and a good conversation piece for your curious vanilla friends."
5,It worked for me,"I play poker with a local group of gals and we all loved this book. I'm sorry I shared it with them, actually, because I was winning a lot more before I did. Being a bridge player, I've always had card smarts, but this book shows that you need a lot more than that to win at poker, and tells you how to do it."
4,"Don't use fast shipping, but book was in good shape.","The book took a week to get to me, but it was in good shape -- 5 star service, if not for the shipping time. I would buy from them again!"
5,Exciting and powerful throughout in interpretaton and fidelity. Phenomenal sound.,"I don't know if its the performance or the sound engineering, but this is surely the most exciting Capriccio I've heard. All pieces on this CD are truly spectacular. I was afraid the CD would play differently from what I had heard over AdagioFM. Nope! Sounds just as good. Great stuff. BIS has become a maker of great sounding CDs, and Rimsky-Korsakov has never been served better. As a result, I shall look forward to more from this conductor and symphony orchestra.One final minor constructive criticism. The graphics are poor, both in color and content. Does not reflect completely what's on the CD. The cover should draw us into the mystique of the music. This one does not. If I hadn't heard it first on AdagioFM, I would not have purchased."
3,"Easily usable, recommendations work","I found this book to be useful and the recommendations work. It uses treats as the primary way of training the dog, and this works reasonably well. However, there are better books to use as a guide for training and raising a dog. Compared to the Monks of New Skete books, this may was easy to use but wasn't as useful. I found both ""The Art of Raising a Puppy"" and ""How to BE Your Dog's Best Friend"" to be better training guides."
2,More theory than expected,"This book is very interesting, but most of it involves psychology of dog behavior. I was expecting more practical training help."
3,Good... a little different,The book is good if you want to become an animal behaviorist. The author tends to tell a lot of stories about her experiences in training all kinds of animals and then instructs the reader to carry out experiments with their friends. I just wanted insight into my dogs behavior.
2,Too scientific to be useful,"I am not sure that the average dog owner - who usually is not committed enough to pick up his pooch's poop - will be able to draw useful behavior out of the book. I love dogs but did not finish the book. In contrast, Jan Fennell's The Dog Listener offer easily appropriated and usefel lessons to the average dog owner."
3,Good for inexperienced dog owners,Enjoyable and easy to read. Good tips for new dog owners. Not so much for those with more experience.
3,not a bad purchase,"this was sort of helpful- I read it in the hall when I'm waiting for dog to be ""quiet"" for certain amount of time before treating. I liked the part about conditioning and flooding. good advice about giving the dog an ""over the top treat"" when leaving- cause dogfood pellets just weren't cutting it for my dog...cheesewhiz and kong works fairly well so far- at least until dog gets bored with it then I'll have to throw down a big ole slab of meat or something to top that business."
4,Practical sense,"This is a great book if you want to increase your understanding of dogs and grow your relationship. It isn't just another book telling you a technique to get your dog to sit. Dr. Yin gives lots of real examples and laces the book with light humor.The big thing for me is that it's practical knowledge. She isn't selling a training ""philosophy"", but showing you what works."
4,Great for carrying around,made carrying my euphonium around a breeze.Not as insulating as I hoped and it was a little roomy for my yep-321.
4,No problem with toner or drum unit,Drum MF8170CIt seems that people either love their Canon 8180c or they hate it. I have had no problem with the price or quality of the remanufactured toner or drum unit. I have had the unit about a year and have just now had to replace the drum. We are in the mortgage business using Vista so it gets plenty of moderate use. The 8180c itself is noisy and I have problems with having to switch paper trays from legal to standard size constantly. Other than that it is a brute of a machine.
5,The Definitive Work on the descendants of James Bankes,"This is 804 pages of linage, maps, wills, deeds from over 50 years of research by the author. This is the definitive work on James Bankes of the Northern Neck of Virginia and his descendants. This is the 5th printing - and according to cousin Frances - there will never be a sixth printing!"
3,Nice,Works as intended yet It is NOT length adjustable and even with my large hands it made the darw length about an inch too short. Had to buy a different brand. This brand used to be adjustable according to guys at the shop.
5,Works like it should,I upgraded my bow and decided to become a release shooter. This has performed perfectly so far even at a budget price. I was nervous as the bow is set for 60 lbs. but have not had any problems. I am sure there are fancier/better releases out there but this works well at a great price.
2,Too Sensitive,"This release is nice but there is only one flaw, it is extremely sensitive. I barely touch it and it opens up. There is now way to adjust the sensitivity from what I know."
5,Perfect for me,"Exactly what I was looking for - an inexpensive release for a novice archer. The trigger is a bit quick, as others have noted, but I have no experience with anything else. Seems well made, and I won't feel bad if it falls apart since it was so reasonably priced."
1,Good looking release... Amazon Fail,"The release works well on my 55# recurve bow. However it was bought for a compound bow purchased from Amazon, that was never delivered. Without the bow I cannot be more accurate as to the quality of the release, but I will say that I find Amazon to be lacking in integrity and customer service. If I ever get the compound bow from Amazon I will modify this review to be more a performance based review than customer service based one."
5,works great.,it works great and strong so dont have to worry about broken or something.i dont see any bad thing on this release aid so i recommend this also it has good price.
4,"Great Research, Fast Read","As a Marine officer, I always thought of Guadacanal in two ways: the Navy abondoned us (and they did) and Chesty Puller. This book rounds out the big picture of the campaign and brings the key battle for Henderson Field to life. The research is awesome! I was constantly amazed at the depth of the sources and the detail. This book is on par with any of the non-fiction battle accounts I have read over the years. It is an easy read, blending official narratives with personal accounts to add life to the tale. I only wish the book had finished out the campaign! If you are a student of warfare, in particular, Marine warfare, this book must be added to your collection. I read it in three sittings but came away with a greater understanding of the Hell that was the ""Canal"". It brought me closer to the Marines who upheld the traditions of the Marine Corps in this first battle in the long march across the Pacific."
2,weak performer,"Good thing there are ten of these. The first one I used separated at the seam in the first few seconds of use. The second one did finish that job, but since I haven't tried the other eight, I do not know if more, most or all of the rest are any good."
5,Niece's First Love,"I purchased this for my niece's first birthday recently. I do not have the advantage of living nearby, but according to my sister-in-law my niece fell in love immediately with this doll and is perfect for her to carry even as she is still getting the hang of walking. My sister-in-law also loves that she can just throw the doll in the washer after a rough day of drooling on and being dragged through the house.What a great doll and I am so happy that my niece will have it to treasure for a very long time. I may even buy her one more just in case she loses this one."
1,Received Damaged,This DVD skips and Pops it's way through the story. While the content is 4 star the quality is definately 1 star.
2,"boring, more history than football","rather detailed, good historical information about LSU football but told in a rather boring manner. Not enough football game footage, sometimes disjointed in telling the story of LSU football"
5,The meeting of two giants of jazz !,"There should not be any shadow of doubt about the professionalism and worriment by the continuous improving of Chick Corea. As a matter of fact he recorded one of the most interesting versions of Mozart's Kv. 466 as long as I remember. On the other hand, the untiring activity with musicians of the level of Pat Metheny, John Patitucci, Dave Wieckl, Bobby Mc Ferrin fits admirably with the curriculum vitae of Gary Burton who shared honors with Miles Davis, Stan Getz and Astor Piazzolla. So, since 1971 this successful combination has allowed him to be acknowledged around so many exigent jazz audiences around the world.Chick Corea (1941) and Gary Burton (1948) -once more- shook hands in this European tour, 1997 with an unforgettable recital. The most remarkable themes were ""Bud Powell"", ""Four in one"" , ""Fiesta"", ""Duende"", Bagatelle VI (In Bartok's memory) and ""Tango.""A true collector item. Don't think it twice."
3,I Wouldn't Get Too Excited About This,"The new song, ""Colleen,"" is, lyric-wise, alarmingly close to boilerplate dorm-room Tori Amosity. (The only Joanna-ish touch is that the song's awakening-to-her-oppression heroine seems to be a were-whale.)Both ""Milk-Eyed Mender"" and ""Ys"" have a muscularity to the playing and singing that's absent here--the arrangements (performed with a small acoustic combo) are much more noodly, and Joanna sings in a more ""controlled"" (i.e, less yelpy) manner.For me this EP lacks the loopy imagination and expansiveness of her previous two records. I hope the relatively-lackluster songs here don't represent the shape her future work will take."
4,This could be a winner,"This subject is of great interest to my partner, to whom I will give this as a gift. I just know it will be great."
1,Diasppointed,"Another piece of mindless music from pretty face Latin boyband whose main objection is to make as much money as possible from discerning music fans. Totally uncreative and irresponsible to the already sad state of the current music scene with mushy and unconvincing lyrics. Would you really believe when these fickle playboys say things like ""You and me all the way"" etc? What happened to lines like ""...The times they are a-changin'..."", ""To everything Turn! Turn! Turn!"", and ""...Put on the red shoes and dance the blues...""?? Absolutely not constructive or inspiring to the youths of today who would most likely grow up with materialistic values or become non-musically inclined. By all means, listen to them on the radio but do not BUY! It won't last! For your sake and mine, I hope I'm right!"
1,Ridiculous,"MENUDO is not a band: it is a project formed by talentless kids conducted by smart Porto Rico managers. And Americans always swallow anything the media put into their throats. The result is that today we have to stand Ricky Martin destroying our ears with his lousy ""music""."
5,What an intro. to the U.S. for a Puerto Rican group!!!,"This is the first English language album for Menudo. It started the 80's ""Menudomania"" and put Puerto Rican singing on the map! These kids can sing, and having grown up in the 80's, this brings back memories of all the great songs on this CD!The songs are great and ""Hold Me"" as well as some others hit it big on the Billboard Top 40 charts. Get this CD and experience Menudo with new CD quality. Back in the day they were only on cassette or records...big difference now!!!"
1,RIO MP3 Players - Stay Away for your own good,"Bought a Rio 600 which has the same 'packaging' as the 800 and 900 - the quality is the cheapest plastic you can imagine, the controls are unprecise and my on/off switch broke after 2 hours of absolutely non-violent indoor use.You'll be bettor off with no MP3 player than with this RIO line."
1,Shoddy Quality,"Bought one. Worked great the first time. The second time out it froze up and would not shut off. Slipped off the battery pack to shut it off and then it wouldn't start again. Got a replacement. Worked great the first time. That night I tried to amend my playlist and the downloading hung up. Checked out the tracks that were on the player and saw some weird scribbling (listed as a track) which I could not delete. And then, again, could not turn off the player. Once again, slipped off the battery pack and then it would not turn on. I'm done with Rio forever!!!"
2,Great Until It Stopped Working,"I bought this player mainly to listen to audio books through Audible.com. This player has lots of memory and can hold 2 whole books and more. I had visions of going on vacation without the stack of books - just the Rio 900. It installed easily. I was able to download books with Audible Manager and listened for about 2 weeks. I did not use the Rio 900 for 2 days. When I picked it up again, it said ""No Tracks"" as if it had spontaneously erased everything. I thought I could just redownload the books, but Audible Manager will not add new content because the Rio 900 is full. Apparently, the index was erased but not the actual files. Attempts at formating the player or erasing all files have not changed the situation. SonicBlue does not answer email support inquiries and telephone support is a very long wait. Once they did answer,they didn't know how to solve the problem. I am sending it back!"
3,Use to be good until...,"Use to love this product until I bought I-River's IFP-190T. The IFP-190T is the same quality of music (it has the same flash memory built inside of it) It holds more (256 MB's as opposed to the 192 this one has) It is much lighter,smaller and easier to cary around (something like 1.1 onces, lightest flash player on the market) and also has a built in FM radio including a radio recording device and a voice recorder with a high quality mic. Plus its fifty bucks cheaper. Now i'm not putting down this product because i must admit i did love it for quite a time but sonicblues support is terrible and i also had battery problems, go with the IRiver flash player, i know you will love it.."
2,PROBLEM NO EXTRA MEMORY,IS OKSETING UP AND WORKING IS COMPLICATEDTHE WORST PROBLEM IS THERE IS NO STANDARD EXTRA MEMORY AVAILABLE I THINK THIS SPOILS ALL THE POSITIVES
1,Addicted to music,"Stay Away from...Uploads often freeze, battery life remaining is a joke it tells you 90 % still available and the player doesn't last an hour (so if you leave home with it make sure to bring some ""AA"" batteries otherwise you might have to sing your way back home), the ear buds are not made for active people if you exercise and sweat they will either fall from your ears or short circuit and leave you with less than one half of the volume, controls are weak when you want to skip more than one songs at the time it often get lost and stop, the player consume energy even when it OFF so you have to shut it off and start over at the begining of your list, The Rio 900 is not even a year old and he`s already obsolete you can't find any support for it. On the Sonic blue website the are no more traces of the Rio 500, 600, 800 and 900 only that should tell you something!! STAY AWAY...."
2,Brutal battery life,"Unless I am missing something after the calibration....the first time I used it, I ran it for 45 minutes while on my bike and it is now showing battery remaining to be 45%. Now I am no big Math whiz, however, I know when a company purports their product to last 10-11 hours on one charge and I will likely get 1.5 hours from one charge....something is missing. And it appears others are having the same problem.I think it is going to have to go back to the store.M~"
5,Great book!!!!,It was a great look at things from Amidala's\Padme's point of view. Sorry this isn't longer but I'm only 13. It is a great book though. I really liked it!! =)
4,Subtle and believable,This book is the events of the movie seen through the eyes of Queen Amidala. The author has captured the speech patterns of a young woman very well. There is some interesting background stuff that's not in the film and that adds to our understanding of Amidala's character. I enjoyed reading it.
4,The best journal,"Whereas Anakin's journal was kind of lacking any depth and was really just another novelization of the movie, this book really gets into Amidala's character, her motivations, and what makes her tick. It clears up all the questions about when she's the queen and when she's Padme, and she lets us into her past a little. The reason this only gets four stars, though, is that I still don't understand the whole ""Journal"" premise -- why write a series of books from the viewpoint of a character whose story we already know well? Additionally, I feel that the author, while she has a very firm grasp of the Star Wars characters, lacks an understanding of the way the SW universe works. She keeps referring to ""the galaxies,"" though last time I checked SW only takes place in one.Overall this is a well-written book for those that want to get to know the queen better, but it is still just another retelling of TPM."
5,Pyle ceiling speaker,Very Happy with purchase. Sounds great! Couldn't ask for anything more for such a great price! You'll be very happy purchasing these speakers. I bought four!!!
1,what's not said in a product description,"I've bought more than a few pairs of in ceiling round speakers. For my application, I don't buy the most expensive.Though this was the first pair where I had to solder to make the connection. a little bit of a hassle when dangling from a ceiling.I've bought others in the same price range that had the spring clamping."
4,good speakers,"showed up fast, installed easy, good price what else is there to say? blah blah blah blah blah blah blah"
3,Pretty good for the price,The speakers did not cost very much so I can't complain. They echo a tad and one of them goes in and out from time to time but it could be our wiring. Overall pretty happy with them. Even if they were to go out in a year they were so cheap we could buy another set.
2,Quality of frame,"I bought two of these speakers. Before being able to install after unpacking, maybe 2 days the frames split on both. They split right by the terminal block posts. Now they have wide splits across and visible on the white ring on the ceiling. As they are now installed I am going to have to fill these wide cracks. I put it down to tight manufacturing tolerances of just plain bad quality plastic. I also bought 2 in wall speakers and these had no problems. So beware of the wall speakers folks they are not to good. Oh yes this is part of a Xmas prezzy install.. I also purchased a Pyle PTAU45 amplifier to go with them. Still in box till 25th, hope it works."
3,Can't beat it for the price,Bought the speakers to put in my bathroom used with a mini T type amp and and ipod.The speakers doesn't have the best finish (on the casing at least) and the on I received has two different white color tones. (one was greenish and the other one blueish)make sure to get a mid range amp to get the best sound quality.overall for the cost it is good
5,Amazing,Have been using wai Lana mats for the last seven years. Non slip perfect for ashtanga yoga! Choice of vibrant colors and thicknesses.highly recommended. Amazon service as always is unmatched!
5,Comfortable Mat,"I have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best. The thickness (1/8 inch) is just perfect - not too thick so it's easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning. What I really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip, in a word, it is comfortable."
3,The necessity of using a yoga mat,"It's almost a necessity to use a yoga mat. I didn't think so when I was taking the yoga class at a local gym, because we never used them. When the gym closed and I started using DVDs and tapes for yoga, I hurt myself. I was in a triangle position, and one of my feet started to slide. Because I was on carpet, there was nothing for my toes to grip. My foot slid, and I could hear muscles (or something) tearing. I wasn't able to stop my foot from sliding, and it just kept going further and further. I guess I tore some groin muscles. For several weeks, I wasn't able to do much beyond stand upright. It even hurt to walk. But I sure learned that I should use a yoga mat. I'd hate for you to have to learn through the same experience."
4,This mat works !,"I feel this mat has been better than some other several mats I have used during Yoga classes or some owned by my friends (e.g. ones from Walmart).I have used 3 times and it worked perfect, NOT slippery at all.Why not 5 star ? I am not sure about the durability of this product. Hope I can re-mark 5 stars after a year or so.If you need the thicker mat (1/4 inches), don't buy one 1/4 thick mat but buy 2 of these 1/8 mats so that you may share your Yoga time with your visitors and friends !!"
1,Way too slick. Couldn't even use it.,"I just received this mat and tried it for the first time at my Yoga class. It was so slick I couldn't even use it. Even in downward dog, my hands were sliding forward and my feet were sliding backward. Maybe I got a dud, but this mat is completely useless to me. Should be 0 stars."
4,Excellent mat,"I have two of these mats - one for home practice and one that I leave at my yoga studio. They are very durable, slightly thicker that other mats and retain slip resistance even during sweaty Bikram yoga sessions.I have bought cheaper and more expensive mats. This is a very good price point/value for someone who practices regularly, but perhaps not daily. I would never buy a cheaper mat again (they are too thin and don't hold up to long-term use), but I think that this is as good of quality as a mat that I bought for $45."
3,If The Shoe Fits,The story is similar to many other stories. The concept is fine. Be yourself. How do you want to be seen? Be like me. Consider the library prior to purchase. It might be useful for very young child imaginations to create other hats.
4,A Hat for Ivan is a good read,This is a great book that says you are special and one of a kind. Great read for everyone.
1,I don't know.,"I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know. The music was not dynamic. The interviews were boring. I love Bluegrass but this thing was so ""not there"" that I was going to send it back to Amazon. But then, we realized that it was pretty funny as a gag gift. I'll be giving this to a good friend at Christmas."
3,Great Performances... I think,"How many times can you forget to mic the soloist? Well, watch this DVD and find out. The technical production is stunningly bad. That's really a shame since the performances are priceless. If the hippies running the show had put the joint down for long enough to take this a little more seriously, this could have been a gem. Instead we get the kind of stage support you'd expect at a high school dance. The backstage bits and interviews took a half hour of my life I'll never get back. It's hard to imagine they were interesting to anyone not directly involved. All those years I thought I should have driven up to Telluride for this festival. Clearly it's a party for musicians by musicians. Same your money gentle listener."
2,bluegrass instruments don't make it bluegrass,"There are some great acoustic music superstars on this DVD. Sam Bush, Bela Fleck, Jerry Douglas, and Tim O'Brien are clearly at the top of their game. But, other than the one Hot Rize performance, this is not bluegrass in any traditional sense of the genre. It does present some really great extended jam band music, often with acoustic instruments commonly associated with bluegrass. A quick check of the credits at the end of the film suggests that there were, indeed, some true bluegrass artists at the concert, but they were clearly left out of the DVD lineup. If you like the Sam & Bela show, this DVD is for you. If you are looking for a bluegrass video, keep looking!"
1,This is not Bluegrass,"This may be ""New"" grass but it is not Bluegrass. Too much percussion and electronic keyboard and discordant sounds. Most of the new groups on this DVD are abandoning traditional bluegrass and are doing their own thing which I can do without."
2,Does NOT originate from USA.,"This nail brush, although it is physically as described, is made in China -- not made, as I was led to believe, in the USA.Purchasing products made in the USA whenever possible is very important to me, and I feel misled by the claim of this product. Shame on the seller for misrepresenting the item's country of origin.In future, please remove the misleading reference and save someone else the unpleasant surprise I had."
3,Bridget's Review,"My husband and I like to watch movies on the weekend and we recently watched Sacrifice [Blu-ray]. Cuba Gooding Jr. is a great actor and did a wonderful job in this movie. The other actors were good and the plot had lots of depth. However, there were a few parts that I felt dragged on a bit. I would have liked to have seen more action but overall, I would say that it's a decent viewing experience. Three stars!"
2,SACRIFICE,"In my search for another good film with Cuba Gooding, Jr...this one was a bit better than THE HIT LIST but not quite it. The storyline was interesting but nothing that I would watch again. I know he has the talent for another good film, just haven't found one since AMERICAN GANGSTER. I'll continue to search."
2,So So movie,I see why it went straight to dvd. It was ok for a Saturday afternoon at home with nothing to do.
2,I should have read the other reviews,"I have to agree with the other reviewers of this movie in the one, two and three star reviews. Three stars even seem a bit overly generous.I'm begining to wonder about Millennium Films. I have not yet seen any of their productions that I could say were any good. I'll keep watching Millennium Films for a little longer but, so far, not so good.It turns out that Amazon reviewers generally hit the target in their reviews. It appears quite worth one's time reading what others have to say before spending money on products. A lesson learned here."
3,Little girl loves it,"My three year daughter is really into Disney's Cinderella right now. I bought this to use a LeapPad we got as a gift. She likes playing the games and hearing the sounds. The storylines are like the Disney movies, only condensed. If your girl likes the Disney Princess product lines, she will like this. If your girl likes LeapPad books, this is like all the other commericially produced products. I chose the free shipping and it only took about a week for us to receive it. That is my favorite part. I did find this product for about the same price in the store."
2,Not a winner,"No one loves princesses more than my daughter, but this book did not hold her attention and interest, even with the princesses in it. That says quite a bit."
3,Got a lemon!,"We have had our Leap Pad for over a year and love it. My 3 1/2 yr old daughter just started using it and wanted a ""girl book"" so Santa brought her this one. It will not work, and says ""whoops, that's not a leap pad cartridge!"" We'll be going back to the store for an exchange to try again. Bummer, she was really disappointed. All our other cartridges still work fine - never had a problem!"
3,It's o.k. I guess... NO REAL LEARNING VALUE,"My daughter seems to like this book, because it's Princess.. but i've noticed it has NO REAL LEARNING VALUE."
5,Proud owner of Leapfrog board!,I am a 9 year old and I have fun with this toy. when I got my princess Leapfrog board I was happy and now I get as many books as can cram into my shopping trolley!
4,Perfect for Preschool Princesses,My daughter received this book with her new pink Leap Pad for her 4th birthday. I thought it would go the way of all her other electronic toys and be played with for a few minutes and then put aside. I was wrong - the Princess activity book has held her attention for several weeks now and she plays with it for 20-25 minutes at a time (an eternity to a 4 year old!). She loves to play the games and especially enjoys when the princesses talk just to her and ask her questions. This has improved both her fine motor skills (pointing to the words in order) and her listening skills. Now we just need the princesses to do a math book too!!!
4,A good book for a child wanting to read,"My 3 1/2 year old has several LeapPad books and likes this one because of the princesses. I think this book would be best for a child who is ready to start reading. My daughter likes to play the games in the book, but isn't really interested in reading the story yet. If your child is ready to focus on the story and read words, this would be a good book. If your child is still learning letters and sounds, I recommend the Phonics Lesson 1 book first, or the other LeapStart books like the math ones (ie. Lots and Lots of Honey Pots)."
4,Saul is a modern secular prophet!,"You can add the name John Ralston Saul to those of Noam Chomsky, Ivan Illich, Franz Fanon (and who else?) on your list of the key late 20th century 'global conspiracy theorists' - people who are visionary seers/prophets who have unorthodox views and make outrageous pronouncements on this and that, but with whom you have to broadly agree. Because they operate outside the conventions of fixed ideologies, they're able to see the broader picture, and see more deeply into the nature of things.The Unconscious Civilization - the 1995 Massey Lectures - was written in an oral style by Canadian freelance intellectual, essayist and novelist John Ralston Saul. His thesis is disarmingly simple: in the long line of history's totalitarianisms, we can now add undemocratic 'corporatism'. Our society, he argues, is only superficially based on the individual and democracy."
4,"meet the new idol,same as the old idol","...Saul intimates that the worship of our comtemporary god may not be a road to Utopia but merely another potential Brave New Worldesque,totalitarian dead-end.When half of your society is on some kind of drug or stimulant;when 25% of your society has an STD;when half of all marriages end in divorce;when the public school system is the laughingstock of the industrialized world;when you have the highest incarceration rate in the world;when a more callous,Darwinian view of life begins to assert itself(the basis of almost all tyrannies of the 20th century);when bread and circuses(Survivor and WWF anyone?)and degenerancy is the norm because it is profitable, then how long can a society sustain itself on such madness?We have collectively lost our minds and our society flails in the void.We have set up and now worship this idol.Saul doesn't seem to think we'll abandon the Green calf anytime soon...."
2,"Pretentious Sequel to ""Voltaire's Bastards""","Generally expands upon a segment of ""Voltaire's Bastards"" (itself an expandsion of magazine article) that I found least convincing - the desire of modern society to invent, build-up and then revile/destroy ""elites"". Not as well developed as previous book nor as well written. I do not recommend it."
4,Essential reading.....,"For any left-wing individual who requires another brick in their psychological wall separating them from reality. Another piece of advice for y'all: Avoid reading ""The Anti-Capitalist Mentality"" by Ludwig Von Mises. You wont be able to sleep at night afterwards."
3,A good read but could be more indepth,"I enjoyed the book and found it an honest defence of infant baptism, and it is good that Bishop Stevenson got to the heart of the grace and compassion involved in Infant Baptism, what does concern me however are two things. One the point of the book, is how exactly it going to help foster ecumenism with the Free and Charismatic Churches? (An obvious and likely pointless question but I feel it needs asking) Two, some more research into modern thoughts and writings on infant baptism might be appropriate."
1,This book is a tribute to it's-not-my-fault thinking.,"This is a boring tale of a boy and his self-interest, self love, self-righteousness, selfishness and self-satisfaction. He is easy prey to someone older who initiates a same sex physical relationship. It's about the young and how easily they fall victim to being a victim. I found nothing that was uplifting, good or enjoyable about this book. It looks like mere propaganda for the self-justification of any behavior of the moment. Do not read it unless you like darkness, depression and defeat masked as victory."
3,"Well done story, but some gaps","Let me say for the record, first off that I enjoyed the book quite a bit. It was well-done, and kept my attention, though some part did make me uncomfortable. Now, for the controversial parts. I don't consider myself homophobic, but I really don't follow the logic here. Maybe I missed it, I don't pretend to be a scholar, but if the holder of the Still's power has to be a virgin to wield it, then how were the three sons of the Queen born. And also, penetration notwithstanding, an orgasm given by another is an orgasm, how can that determine virginhood. If I missed something that made this obvious, I apologize for wasting people's time. Again, a well-done story with a some curious logic about virginity and sexual practices."
1,Worst Fantasy I've read,"I didn't even finish this one. The main character has to be the most hateful and confused character I've come across. After reading the Seafort Saga, this one doesn't even rate. Very disappointing indeed."
1,Yeesh - stay away from this one,Not even in the same league as his Hope series - I really don't know why I forced myself to finish this.
4,"A ""positive"" annyoing story.","If you are in any way Homophobic you will probably not be very comfortable reading this story, which would be a shame because this is a very good story. Like many of the other people who have reviewed this book I found the main character very annyoing, almost to the point were I thought about putting the book down, because ya just wanted to smack Roddy. I found the characters within the story interesting and easy to like,hate and sympathize with. I mention homophobia for two reasons. One,You are reading my review. And two, the story line includes scenes of homo/bi-sexuality that are mild and suggestive (in other words there is nothing explicit) in their depiction. They may make some reader uncomfortable . I also think those scenes are important to the story and the development of the characters involved. I feel any mature person can deal with this book and find it for what it is, a good well thought out story. I look forward to the next Vol."
1,"I like my fantasy WITHOUT sadomasochism, please.","David Feintuch's other books leaned toword strict discipline being required for success, but that was in a military-style story, so it was understandable. This book is supposed to be a fantasy, yet he goes out of his way to create a weak and rotten character who needs repeated humiliation and harsh discipline, to the extent that he appoints someone to beat him when he's bad. And he's always bad. Combine this with our character who must remain ""pure"", i.e. a virgin, but who can have as much homosexual sex as a teenage boy could want (which is a lot) without being considered impure, and I found nothing worthwhile in the entire book. I'm left with severe doubts about the author and am not sure I want to share his view of the world again."
2,"Promisingly interesting, critically flawed","Many people have already commented upon Mr. Feintuch's fascination with badly behaved people learning lessons in painfully slow motion. This book is an orgy of more of the same. What is redeeming about that, at least in his other books, is that we are a society much in need of lesson learning about bad behavior. To the extent that a book can provide insight into our lives, Mr. Feintuch's work is admirable.Problem. As noted, the idea that virginity would be necessary for 'power' is an interesting concept for this genre. Allowing homosexual activities as an 'out' (no pun intended) is an idiotic plot device, however, not the least because it wasn't integral to the story. It also does not make sense, since as someone else put it so delicately, 'penetration is penetration'.Some will say criticism of this is homophobic. Maybe so. Maybe not. Nonetheless, that part of the story will quite likely put off readers on the whole book, for whatever reason."
5,Great for the beginner as well as experienced faster,"This book covered everything I had been searching for in the last year on fasting. Though the cover focuses on weight loss, the book includes many other benefits. It also went into the misconceptions and resulting fears about going without food (with funny, but disturbing examples of paranoia). It can shed some serious light on the current media craze to quickly finger someone as ""anorexic"". It confirmed ideas in my personal experiences with fasting-including why water fasting is easier and better than juice fasting. It has a chapter with many personal accounts of the fasting experience. The print is easy to read and it's not at all wordy (boring). My longest fast was an 11-day juice fast. I am starting again, with much more information to make this a way of life."
1,Very misleading and misguided information on fasting,"This author knows little about fasting and how to properly break fasts. The book contains much misleading and even dangerous information.Much better books on the subject exist.The most complete book, the one every serious faster should own, is ""The Science and Fine Art of Fasting"" by Dr. Herbert M. Shelton"
2,Not what I was hoping for,"If you are interested in finding out 'what' is fasting, or learn more about it's possible values, this may be a good pick. For me, I already buy into the concept, now I just want to know more about how to integrate intermittent (12-18 hour) fasting into my weekly schedule while maintaing optimum health. This has no information (though I have not finished reading) about that and seems to focus on meal plans post long fasting (days long) which I really have no interest in."
1,An unimpressive book,"I agree with the reader from Ann Arbor, MI. This is most certainly not the best book on fasting and may, in fact, be the worst that I have read. Many are superior. Lest anyone think that I am prejudiced against fasting, I am currently in my fourth day of a fast following the guidelines of Paavo Airola's HOW TO KEEP SLIM, HEALTHY, AND YOUNG WITH JUICE FASTING, a MUCH better book.The book gets 1 star because it does, at least, give some background on fasting and can serve as an introduction to the concept."
4,great series amazing author,Tamora Pierce is amazing I have been reading her since I was 13 and I hope she continues with Tortall and expecially Daine and Numair. I love love love those two.
5,Acceptably entertaining,"I very much appreciate this collection of classic stories. The animation and narration are both very appropriate when telling each story. On the contrary of classics like this available, there are so much of modern kids cartoons that are too confusing and distracting all at once and therefore, I appreciate the simplicity of classics such as these. I am trying to raise an intelligent daughter and so I'm very particular about the television programs that I introduce her to."
2,Not so good,"Some stories are good and others are not worth the money my wife and i spent in purchasing this. It is supposed to be something that catches the attention of children and in my opinion, it doesn't really measure up."
2,My 2 yrs old son did not like it,"Just that, He did not like it, He prefferes Cat in the Hat, Dora the explorer and little Einsteins, maybe a little young for this staff"
2,EH..there are better DVD's,I was hoping this would give us hours of great videos for our toddler....but these are NOT like you would expect them. They seem very outdated and for the most part just show illustrations from the book while it is narrated. This has no ability to grasp the attention of a toddler for more then mere seconds...I wouldn't recommend to a friend and certainly not for this price point...they are just way too boring
4,Great Item....Go Sox,Come on...it is the Red Sox...how can you go wrong. Great quality. Will last for years. Great price. Easy to use and take off. looks great. It does go on the outside and not inside.
5,High quality - easy to remove,"This decal is high quality vinyl with red and white print on a clear background. I actually cut the six part away from the wording to use on my car. As noted by others, the cling is on the back so this goes on the exterior of the vehicle. It sticks to clean paint or glass with ease, and removes without any ill efects - at least after a couple of weeks."
2,Clings on the outside,"If you put it on the inside of the car, the white side of the cling shows instead. It should be the other way around. It should cling on the side with the print."
3,Mundial delivers in a big way!,"Great snippers, but they are much bigger and bulkier than I expected. I'll keep them but not for the reason I purchased them."
3,"Geometry - Plane, Solid, & Analytic Problem Solver.(Fist Edition)","It is not the same book that is pictured above. It is missing each chapterintroduction that is given in the 2001 edition, and so it lacks some more detail.joepi18@hotmail.com."
5,BEST BOOK EVER!,THIS BOOK IS VERY COOL IT'S ALSO FUNNY LIKE WHEN GINGER'S BROTHER TIPPER AND HIS FRIEND MARCUS START A BURPING CLUB.MY FRIEND LENIECE AND I READ THIS BOOK TOGETHER AND WE BOTH LOVE THIS BOOK.LIKE HOW JOYCE TRYS CONVINCING GINGER THAT SHES HER MOM.THEN SOMETHING COOL HAPPENS AND YOU NEED TO READ THE BOOK YOURSELF TO FIND OUT.(IT'S WORTH 5 STARS)
5,Ricky Martin's First Menudo Album,"I have this album (from way back when) and if any Ricky Martin music fans care, he sings ""Rayo de Luna"" on this album (#9). These songs bring back so many memories! It's fun to hear Ricky before his voice changed!"
3,pretty good but not the best,"The Lavender smell wasn't as Lavendery as I would like it to be. There's too many other scents in it. Then again, I'm used to pure Lavender essential oil smell. The lotion worked okay for moisturizing as far as lotions go."
1,Not worth the price!,"I was going to give this book to a friend who loves just this...mystery books written by women. I was disappointed to find out that the book is only a list. It lists a bunch of writers, and the books they have written, and includes little boxes to check off when you have read, or bought a title. You could find out the books these women have written at a mystery bookstore. You don't need this for useful info."
1,This is the worst indoor cycling video I've ever seen... don't waste your money,"I have seen a lot of sub-par spinning videos in my life but this one takes the cake on being the dullest, least helpful, and most boring of them all. It has literally no audio track and just plays a seemingly random and sloppily put-together course while periodically putting what intensity you should be at on the screen. No countdowns. No timer. No nothing... If I could do anything to get my money back I would."
1,No preview,"How do you expect people to by from preview when all you show is the intro, with no view of the ride?"
2,Good size - but didn't last long!,"I really liked the size and firmness of the rubber of this ball, but it stopped holding air after less than a month of ownership. And less than a dozen uses."
2,taste buds don't lie,"I tried this product as recommendation....hate to say it, but the basic flavoring isn't what you might hope it to be and the added packet for ""preserving"" the jerky makes it far too salty for consumption. Perhaps if a smaller dose of the ""cure"" might make a difference, I don't know, but the flavoring I was hoping for just wasn't there. I'll give it another shot just in case I screwed it up, but I'm not getting my hopes up."
3,Okay flavor,"I have tried several of the jerky flavors. This one is not well loved by my family. Original seems to be the favorite, or Hot n Spicy in my case. It is not an awful flavor and it still gets eaten by everyone in the household but it is not preferred. There is just something a little off about it."
3,Not great!,Did not have much flavor. There was hardly any Teriyaki flavor to it at all. Will try adding some teriyaki of my own to it next time. I would not buy it again.
4,good choice IF you....,"This flavor is the best one of the Nesco variety, IF you add a little cayenne to spice it up. Otherwise it's just kind of salty, and lacks the peppery flavor of other beef jerky flavorings. I make it this way, and everyone likes it better than the other flavors, kids included."
1,Coattail riding to the max,"This work is nothing more than the attempt to make money off his fathers work. It is sad that he would go to this length to captilize on the popularity of the Lord of the Rings. Im greatly dissapointed. His father was a good man, a good christian, and a great writer. His son is none of the above."
5,Great continuation of a great series,"I never realized how interesting it would be to read a detailed, almost blow-by-blow, account of the creation of a masterpiece. Christopher Tolkien has done all Tolkien scholars, both professional and amateur, a great service by detailing his father's often tortuous development of Middle Earth especially Rohan, Saruman and Isengard, and the creation of Treebeard and the wonderful Ents. Also versions of Frodo and Sam's further journey that are very different from what makes it into ""The Two Towers"" are fascinating. Those who think that Mr. Tolkien has only done this for the money should look again at these works (if indeed they even looked at them at all). No person in his or her right mind would go through this amount of detailed work just for money. No amount of money would be enough to pay for work of this magnitude."
3,The Advocate's Novel,"The Advocate's Devil is a well written piece of fiction that condenses several important legal issues and ethical conficts into one fast-paced narrative. Dershowitz occasionally challenges his readers' powers of logic as so many dilemmas present themeselves in fast succession, all with reasonable solutions, but that is one of the purposes of poetic license.His female characters are not entirely believable, but they are addressing issues of equality and sexual politics that no one has resloved yet. Furthermore, Dershowitz's female characters are cerebral and independent which is more than one can say for many current authors. I enjoyed the story thoroughly and read it in a very short period of time."
1,A very painful read. I was glad when it was done!,After attending several of mr. Dershowitz's lectures I had expected better. The dialouge in this book is almost too painful to read. To think that this book came from the mind of such an eloquent orator. Mr Dershowitz should stick to the spoken word!
3,A pleasant surprise,"I bought ""The Advocate's Devil"" after seeing Mr Dershowitz on the ""Today Show"" promoting his newest novel. I knew that he teaches law and did not know what to expect. The novel was a pleasant surprise. It was good to read and the topic was interesting. The characters appeared a little flat to me, and the frequent allusions to other (real?) cases and important court decisions were too much for me (not being a lawyer). It is a little early to compare Mr Dershowitz to John Grisham whose novels are a lot more entertaining to read (at least the early ones), but the book is okay, and I will definitely read his next novel."
2,It's Alright,"There are some interesting historical and personal anecdotes that make for some decent reading, but like another reviewer mentioned, the actual wheelbuilding part of the book is quite small compared with the rest of the text and the information is available elsewhere on the web for free."
2,Short on Details of Alternatives to 3X lacing,"This book is clear and illustrates well what it does. It falls short, though, on giving illustrations and instructions on alternatives to the common ""3 cross"" wheel lacing patterns. It is arguably worth the cost, but if you are going to get into real bicycle wheel building, this book will be insufficient. I find its title a bit misleading. It is NOT a bench reference in my opinion. It is a INTRODUCTION to wheel building, and certainly not a bench reference for pros and ""wheelaholics."""
4,Good book but incomplete,"I'm a mountain biker who tired of leaving his bike at the repair shop everytime he broke a spoke. I bought this book and read in an evening. I felt there should be a disclaimer as the author obviously has some sort of relationship with DT Swiss, a company who makes componants for wheels (there were times when I felt I was reading one long advertisement). When I finished the book I felt I needed more information before I tackled my fisrt wheel build. I bought ""The Bicycle Wheel"" by Jobst Brandt. It was also quick and easy to read. Both books have their upsides and I'm glad I have both books. Now I'm ready to start building."
2,Disappointing,"Save your money and get The Bicycle Wheel instead. That book has some substance, this thin thing offers little to those interested enough in the subject matter to consider purchasing it. I do like the wire comb binding."
4,Really good wheel building book,"There are two well know wheel building books on the market. ""The Bicycle Wheel"" by Jobst Brandt is one, and the other is this book. While I like the Brandt book, I think this one is my favorite. Brandt's book is full of engineering explanation of how wheels work. I think that is important to know, but I want to know more about wheel building, not just the science behind wheels. Schraner's book concentrates more on actually building wheels and the sport of cycling. Also, the books physical form is easier to lay on a bench and use while actually building a wheel."
5,Definitive guide for beginners and pro builders,"With the most easy to follow directions, this book has helped a total novice become a sought after wheel builder. After building more that 30 sets in the last year, I still open the book and refer to various sections to ""tighten"" my technique. If you are simply a ""bike freak"" this makes for great reading. It helps you understand the importance of well built wheels."
2,Not quite there...,"I'm not sure if this book was translated from German (my guess), but the grammar leaves much to be desired. Directions are often confusing due to diagrams and text that don't quite jibe. I would expect more from a truing section than ""it is a trial and error process"". Mr. Schraner obviously has a lot of knowledge, I just don't feel it comes through clearly in the book."
2,"Coulda, should, woulda","I enjoyed the book from the perspective of the vibe of the race mechanic or wheel builder. As a wheelbuilding resource it is both unnecessary and inaccurate. He has his own way of lacing a wheel which reverses the order. I guess it works but it isn't an improvement. He also seems to have held back what he actually knows, a real wheel tech should be able to inundate the home mechanic with information. Maters so trivial the pro has absorbed them often without thought. But for those who don't live in the world, depth helps us pull together the full pictures. Sadly not here."
2,Disappointing!!!,"This book narrowly focuses its content to help students who have special needs and in so doing, makes an inappropriate assumption that only these students need help with reading textbooks. This is not the case. All students benefit from teaching methods directed at effective use of a textbook. The book does share a number of techniques for helping students better read and make sense of textbooks. While some of the examples are interesting, these are taken from books by experts which are far better prepared for helping students with reading. Textbooks are only one reference in a good educational setting. However, the author inappropriately spends much time addressing textbook layout as a major piece ignoring the control and expertise that is possessed by the teacher. I was quite dissappointed at the position in which this seemed to place teachers. I was also disappointed by the fact that although this is the fourth edition of the book, it still has many errors."
3,"Just ""okay""",I bought these after their endorsement on Kimberly Snyder's blog. I like to chew my chlorella and these aren't very tasty. I prefer the ones I normally buy. I finished my package but didn't buy another.
4,A very good CD for a different type of techno,"I just receivced this CD by post, and I enjoy listening to it while just hanging out. It's listenable, and not so intense that it sounds clubby. It's great for someone who's tetering on the edge of sanity from listening to too much candy-coated pop music."
1,Same old stuff - nothing new,I can't beleive I waited this long for the new release. The best tracks are on radio play and they are only OK. Don't waste your money. I wish I could return my copy and get my $ back.
2,not good,when this cd first came out i did like it because it was new. BUT THE CD IS NOT GOOD. IT DOES HAVE THERE 80S SOUNDS ON IT . BUT IS NOT AS GOOD LIKE PYROMANIA AND HYSTERIA. i THINK THEY TRY TO HARD TO ME THEIR SELF . THERE NEW CD COME OUT IS YEAR. i HOPE THERE NEW CD IS WILL BE GREAT.
5,Excellent!,"For me, this album seemed like it captured the best moments of their other albums on put it all together. Plus they involved Vivian Campbell (who used to play for Dio) fully on this album not only in song writing, but in playing. A couple of these songs any Dio fan would recognize when Viv was playing the solo. Promises and Paper Sun are refreshing and great sounding tunes while Demolition Man and Back In Your Face kick the adrenaline in. A pleasant surprise givin' the mellowness of their previous albums (except for Retroactive). Hopefully, this is the way future ablums will stray cause this one was a killer."
4,DEF LEPPARD ROCKS ON!,"Euphoria is alot different from the days of Pyromania, but it is a good album none the less. Just about every song on ths one is worthy of radio airplay, and its a real shame we don't hear more of them on the FM. I recommend this album to all fans, old and new. It wont disappoint you:-)"
2,"Plain & simple, they will never live up to Hysteria.","Promises & Paper Sun are sub-par and Demolition Man and Back in Your Face are horrible. Listen to it before you buy it. Pyromania, Hysteria, and Vault are the only ones worth getting."
4,The boys are back!!,"Welcome back Def Leppard. Long live Rock and Roll; may we now reclaim the airwaves as our own. I would have given them 5 stars; however, I believe some of their other albums are better (not Slang). A great album for the die hard fans."
5,Fun Fun Fun,Too many people hypercriticize music to the point that they forget the basic principle of music--to entertain. Def Leppard has never failed to entertain their fans and this is (by far) Def Leppard's best effort ever at ENTERTAINING the fans. I don't look to the group for deep meanings or insight into life... read a book for that! These boys discovered how to Rock'n'Roll and have fun again. I wish more 'Critics' would recognize that.
5,"Def Leppard ""Promised"" and they delivered!","After standing in the dark ages with the experimental ""Slang, Def Leppard is sitting in the hot seat with Euphoria. It is filled with the Lep we all loved in the 80's. With raido-friendly songs like ""Promises"" and ""Goodbye"" to heavier ""Pyromanish"" songs like 'Paper Sun"" and ""Kings of Oblivion,"" Def Leppard brings back the sound that most people wanted them to resort back to. Although I liked Slang, this is the Def Leppard that I fell in love with years ago. Overall, this album is a cross between Pyromania and Hysteria--just like the front package says!"
4,Def Leppard continues the tradition.,"The new album Euphoria is a good attempt at reliving the 80s. With the Alternative Era hopefully on it's way out, Def Leppard continues to create music with a ""good feeling"", not a down and out gothic attitude. I recently saw them perform at the NYS Fair grounds in Syracuse, and what a performance. The energy was overwhelming! The fans were fired up. Ironically the band stayed at the same hotel as my wife and I did. We met Vivian Cambel, Joe Elliot, and Phil Collin. They were fantastic. We commented on how much we liked their performance, and they were most greatful. Major musicians as they are, and they took the time to chat with a couple of their fans. I was surprised on how down to earth they were. It was a great experience, and that's what music is about."
5,They're Back!!,"I must say that I was floored when I heard ""Promises"" on the radio for the first time. I thought ""now this is the Def Leppard I know and love!"" However, when I first played Euphoria in its entirety, I was let down. I was expecting a ""Hysteria...part 2"". Well, that it isnt...after all, I dont think it is possible for ANYONE to do an album quite like that. Over the past couple months, however, I have listened to the album over and over, and the songs that started off as a disappointment, have grown on me and I must say that it has quickly become one of my favorite albums. I firmly believe that ""Promises"" is one of, if not, THE best song musically that they have ever written. We're talkin comparable to ""Sugar"" and ""Rock of Ages"". Bottom line, if it doesn't appeal to you right away, give it a little time. I am glad I did, as it has turned into a mainstay in my current music rotation."
5,There back and I couldnt be more thrilled,"I've been a def leppard fan many years, and there new album really delivers. I was so exited to here they where coming out with euphoria, there old sound is back with a little twist. This album is awesome. If you dont have it, get it. A TRUE FAN"
5,Their best album so far....killer songs..,"I have heard part of every song on the album and I have to say that this is by far their BEST album yet. It sound like Hysteria but with new, fresh sound. Euphoria is Def Leppard at their best. Eleven of the thirteen songs on the album are great. I would give the album six stars if I could."
5,Def Leppard is the Rock Of (ALL) Ages,"Def Leppard will never disappoint their true fans. No matter how long it takes them to get the next album out- they just can't go wrong! I heard a sample of ""Promises"", ""Back In Your Face"" and ""Paper Sun"" a few weeks ago and it brought back that great ol' Leppard sensation. After hearing the entire song of ""Promises""- I can't wait to see them LIVE again! New Jersey fans are waiting with open arms."
5,"THEY ROCK,DUDES!","Def Leppard's album EUPHORIA was superb! If you tell me it isn't good,I will be mad!Cause it was a goo--------------d album and it one my favorites!So if u need any insight on DEF LEPPARD,u give me a call!"
2,"Been there, done that.","After the brilliantly original Slang, Def Leppard's return to their old guitar pop seems like a big step backwards. It's sad to see the band succumbing to commercialism again after the promise and inventiveness Slang showed. This album is too much pop, too 80's, been there, done that."
3,Some of this CD makes my ears hurt!!!!,"I have been a DL fan since 1987, and was sincerely hoping ""Euphoria"" would be along the lines of ""High n Dry"" and ""Pyromania."" WRONG!!!!! I even started to balk at ""Hysteria"" enough not to buy ""Adrenalize"" and ""RetroActive."" I was hoping this new release would be a rocker. NOT!!! The best tracks on this are""Promises"", ""Paper Sun"", and ""Goodbye."" The rest are new-age crappy sounding songs. OK, so I haven't listened to it over and over yet, but I have to skip a lot of the songs because they hurt my ears. I say they need to get back in the studio and try again!!!! For now I'll listen to ""Pyro"" and ""High n Dry"""
2,Disappointing Release,This Cd has about 4 good songs but This is not a return to form as mention. This album the Leps try to please too many people make their songs so pop and polished they are devoid ofany emotion. If you want to hear great 80's rock inthe 90's buy the new RATT!
3,Another Disappointment,"I picked up a copy on the release date, took it home to listen to and just shook my head. This band has gone down hill after ""Adrenalize."" I apologize if I offend and I am sure there will be people offended to what I have to say. I'm an 80's rock fan. It makes me sick to see bands give in to alternative music, which is what Def Leppard and other bands like Motley Crue have done. Pull out some of Def Leppard's older stuff like ""Pyromania"" and ""On Through The Night."" It seems that when Steve Clark passed away, the hard rockin' music of Def Leppard died with him. The three star rating is being generous. Pyromania is perhaps one of the greatest hard rock albums ever made. You can tell from ""Euphoria"" that Mutt Lange had a limited say in the engineering of this one."
3,"Over-Hyped, Underwhelming","Wall of guitars, Yes. Bombastic drums, Yes. Tongue-in-cheek lyrics (21 Century...), Yes. Great Production, NO. Def Leppard glory days...to be decided. The strongest aspect of the 'old' Def Leppard was Joe Elliot's raspy, on the prowl voice. Remember 'Rock of Ages' and 'Bringin on the Heartbreak' or even 'Work it Out'? The 'new' Def Leppard sound is weakened by Pete Woodruffe's production values. Sure there are some feet-stompers and sing along choruses here such as 'Demolition Man', 'Promises' and '21st Century'; but Joe Elliot's voice is drowned out and weakened on most songs. Mutt Lange really knew how to twist the knobs and push these guys to the best of their respective abilities and it shows on 'Pyromania' and 'Hysteria'and 'High 'n Dry'. Hopefully, the Leps will make a mark again with this one. Only time will tell."
2,Terrible,"A big step backwards after the vastly underrated 'Slang'. Mutt Lange returned to the fold and that is why this album suffers. Overproduced and poor writting. Ranks right at the top with Adrenalize as Leppard's weakest effort. Although this album does have to bright spots, the epic rocker 'Paper Sun' and the very strong 'Day After Day'. The rest is terribly cheesy 80's sounding garbage."
2,As bad as Adrenalize,I reviewed this title a few yrs back and gave it 1 star and thought about it again today and I'm bumping it up to 2 stars. Its still nowhere as good as the 4 earlier efforts (on through the night through to Hysteria). To me this sounds too much like Adrenalize with 2 guitarists (this time round) from what I can recall paper sun was the only decent song. I no longer own this (sold it after a week). Def Leppard have been suffering from 3 things since Hysteria 1.The death of Steve Clark 2.the absence of producer Mutt Lange and third writer's block (big time). I think they have forgotten their roots they have been coasting it ever since and playing ballads and pop songs (in an attempt to get on the radio and score a hit again). Overall this is a subpar release from a top band.
1,Ugh!,"I love Def Leppard. I HATE this album. Guys, you've sold a gazillion albums and won respect--now please spare what's left of your dignity and retire? Please? I'm asking nicely."
2,euphoria,this cd sucks . I loves def leppard back in the 80s. since hysteria def leppard has not a great cd. when def leppard did slang it was a good move. I think def leppard went backward with euphoria because the 80s are over. their are only 2 good song on euphoria promises and papersun. I hope their next cd sound like slang.
1,two months away from x,the new def leppard cd come out on july 30 2002 . x is the name of their new cd. I know that their last 2 or 3 cd was not good. but I think their new cd will put them back on top. we will all find out on july 30 2002 if x will be their come back cd.
5,PROMISES,"In the wake of ""Slang"" , Def Leppard returns to the sound that sold millions of records for them. ""Euphoria"" is one of the best Def Leppard CDs to date. All the songs on the CDs are worth listening to and offer a mix of old and new."
4,Leps return to form in Euphoria,"Def Leppard scores again with Euphoria. A product of an ever aging and maturing group, Euphoria is an excellent return to the form that brought Def Leppard most of it's success. Fans who are looking for another Hysteria might be disappointed as this album comes from a Def Leppard that is 12 years older than the one who released Hysteria. The album is a great one though, with an excellent mix of rock(Demolition Man, Back in Your Face, and 21st Century Sha La La La Girl) and ballads(Promises, Goodbye, and It's Only Love). True Lep fans will not be disappointed."
5,I Loved It!,"Euphoria is a great album, there isn't a song I don't like on it! The first time I heard ""Promises"" and ""Demolition Man"" was live in concert and right there and then I knew I had to have the album and Leppard did not let me down. There are a good variety of songs that keep rocking! I love it andthat is all that is important to me. Everyone who did not like it can stay stuck in the 80's"
4,Best comeback I've ever heard!,"To tell the truth, my first few listens to Euphoria were very disappointing, but after hearing it a few more times, I have grown to love it! My most favorite songs are Promises, Goodbye, All Night (Great attention getter for female fans), Paper Sun and To Be Alive. The rest are great too!"
2,Not what I expected,"Heard the first song ""promises"" on the radio & thought DL was back but after buying this I realize they need Mutt Lange back producing & writing more songs than the small amount he did...extreme disappointment is an understatement"
3,disappointing........,"i heard that def leppard was going back back to their rock days with this one,but i was very disappointed.it sounds just like adrenalize and slang and doesn't really rock.basically the same sound with different lyrics.i was hoping for something more like pyromania.i'm a big fan of def leppard,but i'm starting to lose interest.wait and buy it used so you don't waste your money.sorry guys,but i was hoping for more bang for the buck."
3,A Repeat of Hysteria.,Def Leppard has mellowed over the years and if youer looking for their best albums I would still have to go with High and Dry and Pyromania. Since those two albums they have become to commercial. It is to bad the band is forced to push top 40 music.
2,A bit disappointed ... or a big disappointment ?,"That album ain't bad, it simply lack of that magic touch. There's good songs ('Promises', 'Paper Sun' or 'All Night' are above the rest) but very average mix and production : a bit of the problem lies here (where's Mutt ?). Better luck next time, guys. Instead, listen to another brilliant UK act nammed THUNDER. Their last cd release ""GIVING THE GAME AWAY"" is maybe what ""Euphoria"" miss !"
3,mixed feelings,"As I am a huge fan of the group I had immense hopes. The album is OK, but the compositions are somehow forced not to resemble the older ones. I must confess I was more confident in the Slang path, though there are interesting directions here too. But nevertheless Def Leppard is, with AC/DC and ZZ Top, the group I enjoy most. Thank you guys!"
5,They're Back in Your Face!,"Time to rock again! After the paltry ""I wanna be Nirvana"" release of Slang, as well as poor outings by Aerosmith and Van Halen in recent years, Def Leppard finally brings us back to the meaningless rock and roll that doesn't want to make us bleed our hearts for the children of the world and the lack of a bear patrol. (Simpsons fans will know what I'm talking about:) 21st Century Sha la la la Girl has absolutely no meaning at all other than to have a good time, as does Demolition Man and Back in Your Face. To please the critics at Rolling Stone they've put a couple of moody tunes in there with Paper Sun and Day after Day, but they're pretty good too. A great addition to your party rack of CD's, as well as for the collector of good music. Rock on!"
5,glad to see that the boys got their senses back...,"hey, every great band is entitled to their 'Slang' once in a while, but I'm sure glad they got out of that rut quickly! if it ain't broke, don't fix it!"
2,The band out to make a buck,"I was very disappointed when I heard it, I really thought I would hear the maturity of this band but instead got a feeling that this band put this out to make a quick buck and run. I would hope in the future that the band show us a little more what they can do and not what they can't do."
2,Disappointed down South,"Hysteria and Adrenalize were the 2 best albums/CDs Def Leppard has put out. Since then, their attemps at new music could only be described as mediocre. Euphoria is no different. 2 songs - Promises and Guilty are the only two worth listening to. I was wondering why the local Rock Stations weren't playing more songs off this CD, now I know why. Skip this CD and wait for the greatest hits..."
1,you can't be serious,"Have you noticed that Joe can't shout no more? He hasn't been able to since ""Slang"", but that album had some different music, which I thought was a sign of maturity for these former poster boys who perhaps just happened to seriously ROCK on 2 amazing albums (""Pyromania"" and ""Hysteria""). So I was fully expecting the Lepps to continue in that new-found grown-up direction and break more new ground; instead I get this half-baked bunch of shallow teeny-bopper cheesecake. C'mon people, you know they can do better than this. Fans will be fans even the Lepps put out an album's worth of fart sounds; who cares if you're a true fan or not? Just put out a good album and I'm listening."
1,Depressing!,"Boy, talk about selling out! There in it for the money. There not interested in the music. It's sad. I've been a Leppard fan since the beginning but no more."
1,AWFUL!,"If you're looking for an honest review of EUPHORIA, here it is: This record is nothing but a crappy sequel to Adrenalize! It's doesn't sound anything like High & Dry, Pyromania, and/or Hysteria like it was advertised! Def Leppard died with Steve Clark!"
1,OVER RATED!,"I can't believe that even the hard-core Leppard fans would think that this album is talent? and sounds different? Give me a break! Do you really want the same sound and ""BUBBLE GUM"" rock from a band who's capable of producing some of the worlds best music? Keep searching folks, this Leppard fan says way way way ""OVER RATED"""
4,one of the better more recent leppard cds.,I like this one. Very Pyromania like. Probably there best cd since hysteria.
5,What's next... Project X,"This was Def Leppard's version of Aerosmith's Permanent Vacation. It's a return to the sound that made the Lep what they are and although it didn't sell two or three million copies, it allowed them to be themselves. Slang, the previous album was their answer to the depressed 90's group. They had to try. Fortunately, this album is/was by all accounts a success. The tour, was huge, beginning with a free show in front of a Walmart in Texas where traffic was backed up in all directions for 9 miles. How's that for an indication of what's to come? At any rate, the next album is due this spring (2002) and at this time, it's name is simply ""X"". No, not ""X"", but the roman numeral equivalent of ""10"". Yep folks, this is the leps ""tenth"" album and it's sure to be a good one. Watch for it here or go to their website for more info..."
4,Good 80's Style Effort,"So after putting out an interesting and diverse album such as ""Slang"" during the tail end of the Grunge movement the boys figured it was safe enough in the late 90's to recapture some of their 80's fans with a full-out 80's rock album. Well, they pretty much succeeded. There are some great rock songs like ""Demolition Man"", ""Promises"", ""Paper Sun"", ""Guilty"", ""Day After Day"", and ""Kings of Oblivion"" but then there are weird tunes that don't quite find the mark such as ""Back In Your Face"" and ""All Night"". Unfortunately they throw a couple ""Adrenalize"" style ballads on here as well which really drag down the album. However, if you're quick on the skip button this is a very enjoyable Def Leppard album and falls in line nicely with their 80's material."
5,Almost Hysteria....,"Back in Your Face, huh? Definitely. Def Leppard Has done an awesome job on this CD, and it only took a year to record? Wow. Anyway, Best tracks in my opinion are...21st Century...Girl, Demolition Man, Goodbye, Guilty, Kings of Oblivion, Paper Sun, and Promises, in that order. The rest are very good, too, except for ""All Night."" What a joke. Almost as bad as How Many Say I"" by Van Halen. The Backing vocals sound vintage, but even bigger, which is cool, Joe sounds very good, and from what I can tell, (DIE HARDS will hate me for this) but I don't miss Steve Clark on this one. But I do miss you man. Anyway, if you enjoyed Hysteria, and if you're reading this, you probably did, I'll rank this one right behind Hysteria. My only complaints - All Night sucks, and maybe too ballad heavy? Personal preference, i suppose. Great work guys! Now go get this album! Get em' another Diamond Award!"
1,"amazing, the boys are back","well, it's about time we heard something good from somebody. the hard rock with the power ballads make euphoria a treat to listen to. don't compare it to hysteria though or you might get disappointed. once again the leps come through when rock was dying. hopefully the radio will play it this time and let the new generation enjoy what we have all come to enjoy and that is good consistent music from the worlds number #1 band"
4,Some of the best music ever,"The first few tracks on this CD are a perfect hybrid of the best melodic power pop/rock from the hysteria days and the slick new production we had all come to expect by the late 90's. Most of the rest of the CD is more mediocre like a lot of the tracks on Adrenalize. It's cool to hear them do an instrumental (Disintegrate), but that track doesn't have the melodic riffs and great songwriting that some of the first songs do. All in all, however, Euphoria is a truly great album - the last before they started to sound like the Backstreet BoysNever Gone."
5,thirsty for more Leppard!,"I cant wait for the new Leppard cd X to come out..when Euphoria first came out, i wasnt crazy about it..it took awhile to grow on me..from the clips ive heard it sounds like it will be more of the same on the new album..the style doesnt sound too different..,my only complaint is that they limit the slow ballads.im tired of them.that is why i like Euphoria so much..it got back to their rock roots!"
2,As weak as it gets,"I'm glad somebody out there likes this CD, because Def Leppard is one of the greatest rock bands of all time. But seriously folks, it's just plain bad. There's nothing exciting, fresh, or even interesting to offer. One track is okay... ""Back in your face"" because it's at least fun, but the rest are really boring. ""Promises"" starts off 'promising' but the lyrics fall flat and the song never really leaves the ground. This is the only Def Leppard album I've ever given thumbs down to, but the band seems to be out of ideas and Mutt is sorely missed in the control room. Even as bad as Adrenalize was (""Let's Get Rocked"" was the tackiest rock song ever, only second to ""Cherry Pie"" by Warrant.) But even Adrenalize had it's moments. Here's a tip guys, if you aren't writing great songs, collaborate with fresh new writers. It works for Kiss and Aerosmith and dozens of other groups who stay on top."
1,It's just not very talented,"Lets face it this record wasn't the creativity of DL, it sounded to me like what the record label wanted them to put out. I bet you if you had a conversation with the guys they would be the first privately to tell you that if was up to them the record would sound a lot different.What this CD lacks is the cohesiveness and the talent that these guys once had; sure it sounds nice and predictable, but is it talent?In this reviewers opinion it's just not worth the wait, try again and this time on YOUR OWN."
2,What Happened to the Rock?,"This band was a great rock band once. They say Hysteria superrocketed them to stardom, but I say it was the momentum from the truly good rock albums of Pyromania, High & Dry, and On Through The Night. This band made intelligent rock with songs like Die Hard the Hunter, Billy's Got a Gun, Bringing on the Heartbreak. They went totally into cheese with Hysteria, became hugely commercially successful, and abandoned the rock. They need to go back to their roots and put something out for the rockers, not the teeny-boppers that love cheese."
2,Buy the singles,"Let me sum up: 1. Excellent 2. Sucks 3. Excellent 4. Sucks 5. Good 6. OK 7. Lame 8. OK 9. Sucks hard 10. Fun tune, not much too it 11. Lame 12. Worst on the record 13. OKSo you're better off getting the singles for songs 1 and 3 if you can find them. Or better yet, just put them on MP3."
3,good cd but 10 years to late.,euphoria is a good cd. but euphoria sounds like to much like a 80s cd. if def leppard put out euphoria back in 1989 or 1990 euphoria would have be better.
4,"Similar to ""Adrenalize""","Although not nearly as disappointing as the awful ""Slang,"" saying this album is a cross between ""Pyromania"" and ""Hysteria"" is an overstatement. This is very similar to ""Adrenalize."" If you liked that album, you'll like this one, and if you didn't like that one, you probably won't like ""Euphoria"" either. Although the Leps have proven that they're still as talented as ever, they seem to have lost that *hard* rock edge they once had. They can still *roll,* but they seem to have forgotten how to really *rock.* Overall, it's a good album, but Hysteria it ain't."
5,AND THE BEST TRACKS ARE.............,"the best tracks on the album are:Back in your faceTo be AlivePaper SunDay After DayKings of OblivionDesintigrateTo every one goes to who says that this albumdosn't contain any thing from 'Hysteria,Pyromaina ' days.All the tracks listed are Heavy ,Rocky &Guitarfest!!!!yes to all the (so called fans) just try to play(To be alive ,or any of the rest)then come hereand write a comment !!!!!DEF LEPPARD ROCKS MOR THEN ANY BLOODY ROCKBAND!!!AND THATS GOES IN YOUR FACE PUNK!"
5,Back In Our Faces!!!!,"The Leps are back!!! Is this 1988 or 1999? Def Leppard's latest, called ""Euphoria"", is a return to the sound that made the boys from Sheffield famous. Not only have they returned with great hooks and melody, but also with the darkness from 1996's ""Slang"" was brought out on this album. If you are even a remote fan of the band, then pick up this album."
5,DEF LEPPARD Back Again!!!,"I love Def Leppard's new CD ""EUPHORIA""! My favorite songs on the album are ""Promises"", ""Back In Your Face"" and ""Paper Sun""!Style wise, I'd say that ""EUPHORIA"" is closer to the musical style of such earlier Def Leppard albums as ""Pyromania"" and ""Hysteria""!I was really disappointed with Def Leppard's 1995 release ""SLANG""! So it was nice to hear that they have gone back to their old style with their latest release ""EUPHORIA""!DEF LEPPARD is a great band, plain and simple!Long Live DEF LEPPARD!!"
3,Kind of dissapointed,"I had heard all the hype that this was more on the lines of Pyromania and Hysteria, but it really isn't. Very few songs that really rocked. Still too much ""pop"" and the drums just sound too electronic, too ""80 ish"". I wish Joe would scream on some of the songs instead of trying to sound so ""polished"". Overall, not a bad album. But, it definately did not blow me away."
4,"BEFOR YOU BUY IT ""GREAT BUT NOT THE BEST!!!!!!!""","Def Leppard are back with a new album "" EUPHORIA"" it sounds far better than ""ADRENALIZE"" but there is very small input from ""PYROMANIA , HYSTERIA"" I miss the crunchy sharp guitars!!!, tracks like: 'Papersun,Day after Day,Kings of Oblivion,Back in your face& the great Disintegrate' do have a great Metal,Rocky sound in them. the Ballads are Great but there is 5 of them (a bit much for Rockers!) But the worst track have to be 'ALnight' it's just not DEF LEPPARD at all (hip-hop funcky dancy stuff) A 4 star for this one, it is a must have CD A master peice from the Masters hopefully the next one will be the BEST DL thanks Suff"
5,The final piece of the Trilogy!,"Awesome! Def Leppard is back with there best since Hysteria. Many catchy tunes including Promises,Back in your face,and one of there traditional ballads also my favorite off the album Goodbye. Any fan of the band should own this. 80's rock is back!"
1,A big disappointment,"Ok, I finally gave in and bought the CD. I must say when I first heard it I was sort of excited, but as the CD went on and the songs begin to sound a little shallow I became very disappointed. I expected DL to show us a little more talent and to enter into 1999 with a sound of maturity, what we got was a band out to make some money for the record companies. Is this really DL at there best or is it DL at a point of desperation?In my book it's a point of desperation from a band that once had the potential to go down with the best of them in rock and roll history. It's probably not all their fault; we should blame the record companies for putting out a sound that dates back ten to fifteen years.Try again.... 1 Star."
1,Therey not back!,"At least the talent, yes the sound is what the record company wanted it to be but the talent is lacking. I do like this cd don't get me wrong but comparing to todays standards it is a little dissapointing. If it wasn't for the big name label I doubt this record would have ever made the charts.try again."
1,A real shame,"Def Leapord doesn't show us the talents that the band once had, instead they show us there (Wallet)they have sold out to the music industry.Very Very sad. Yeah it sounds nice but it isn't talent."
3,Old & in the way - not yet,"I read many reviews on this cd and I was really excited about getting it. The reviews pumped it up big time. I don't see it that way. Yes there are some very good tunes on this cd, but I feel like thay are trying to appeal to the masses. Too many songs geared toward the female population... you know, those soft melodic-type songs that beg for airplay on the FM radio (kind of like what Aerosmith did). They've lost the cutting egde that they had with Pyromania and Hysteria. However, It is a nice rebound after the awful ""Slang"". If you like middle of the road rock/pop songs, this is for you. If you are looking for the Def Leppard of old (mostly harder tunes with a slow one thrown in for measure) - you won't find it here. Reminder... Def Leppard were in their prime about 15 years ago. Most of the great rockers slow down with age."
5,"Another ""Hysteria""-type album","If you take ""Hysteria"" and add a little more energy and spunk then you've got ""Euphoria"". Each song has it's own appeal, unlike some albums that sound like the same song reworked 10 times. If you like killer hooks and harmonies with a rock edge to it then you'll love ""Euphoria""-Go get it now!"
5,The real Def Leppard has returned...,This album is awesome is you needed a def fix! The guys came up with the style we all remember them starting and now finishing. Way to go guys. This album has some great rockers and a great ballad in goodbye. Day after day is incredible as well as Paper sun. They are real rock back from the dead. If you like the Def of old here you go......
3,"Did an OK job, not great.","I've used a couple different engine degreasers in the past, this one didn't seem to do as well of a job. Sadly I don't recall the names of the other brands. I followed the instructions pretty well, and applied a fairly liberal amount, but it didn't quite get my engine what I would consider clean."
5,Can't go wrong with Engine Brite,"I have been using Gunk Engine Brite for thirty years and it still is the best. I needed to clean the engine and surrounding area on my 1965 Mustang so I ordered two cans of Engine Brite. Went to the local car wash, applied Engine Brite and then power washed it off. It did a real nice job on the 45 year old grime that was under my hood. Works best with the engine warm and dry."
1,Not legal in California,Product is not legal in California based on the label but was still shipped to a California address. Unable to use the product.
3,Ok Read,The book was a solid read. From start to finish the author had a consistent plot line that was easy to follow.
1,Big disappointment,"I enjoyed two of John Case's other novels, but this one was a big let down for me. Case spends way too much time describing minutia and details that aren't relevant to the story line, and it makes the book a chore to pour through. The dialogue isn't very believable. i was looking forward to this book, but it will keep me from reading any more Case material."
3,Ending Peters,"As with the two previous novels this husband and wife team has written, this book starts off with a bang that carries the reader away in a tsunami wave of unbelievably and seemingly unconnected events. However, once the suspense climax is reached and the sinister plot puzzled out, the authors have a hard time keeping the reader's adrenaline pumping at the same heart wrenching pace. Somehow, the actual scene where McBride enacts his revenge seems trivial, a necessary part of the story, but one the reader flies through with the hope that there is a twist that will topple what he already believes to be true and again skyurocket his manufacture of adrenaline.I read this book while traveling via plane; it is more than adequate to keep one's attention, the premise and the facts gathered to offer the denouement are plausible and sufficiently sinister to make one wonder where and when such events actually occur. I will read another John Case thriller in the future."
4,Good Fun,"The bottom line is that if you want to be swept up into a book quickly, get lost in it, and have a satisfying conclusion, this is for you.A sinister Swiss clinic, neural implants, assination plots of major world leaders, psychology at its worst and frustrated lawyers all combine to lend themselves to an eeringly plausible thriller that will kinock your socks off and scare you out of your wits.Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down, and stayed up all night to finish. This is not the most well-written fiction out there, but the prose is snappy and engaging. The characters are well drawn and the plot is, well, well-plotted.I wouldn't waste your time if I really didn't enjoy this book. Check it out for yourself. You won't be disappointed."
1,A big disappointment!,"After reading The Genesis Code and thouroughly enjoying it, this book is a complete disappointment. I could not believe how messy and poorly developed the plot was. This book read as a weak attempt of amateur writers to write about profound matters.I guess, no more John Case for me: the duo is degenerating fast."
1,Get out!,"The first half is not so bad. After that ""John Case"" obviously lost all interest in this ... and so did I. Besides: An author who does not care about details is not to be trusted in general. You can't buy an assault rifle just like that in Switzerland! John Paul I was certainly not killed because of Vatican II. ""Case"" does not know anything - and did no research - about radiology (especially CAT scans) and he certainly does not speak German: A ""hunter store"" is no ""Speicher fuer Jaeger""!"
4,Solid Page Turner,"Alright, every now and then I indulge my reading habits with some ""pulp."" And, I'd categorize this book as being in there with Ludlem, Cussler, Cook etc. in style of plot. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised with how solid this book turned out to be. While never rising above its genre, it is nonetheless a very good pageturner. Better, in my opinion, then the former two books Case has written, this book continues the combination of science and thriller. A few leaps in logic, but good, good, stuff."
4,READ the book; SKIP the audio version,"The advantage of audio books is that characters, setting, etc. generally are presented to the reader exactly as the author intends. I doubt, however, that the authors of The Syndrome intended for their female characters to sound so absolutely silly. With due respect for Mr. Hill's talents, he is clearly lost when trying to imitate female voices. The voice of the protagonist Adrienne, in particuar, teeters between that of a grown man mimicking a 4-year-old child and the authentic voice of a 90-year-old woman. I was never able to visualize with any credibility what certainly was intended to be a strong, independent, and sexy 20-or-30-something lawyer. Mr. Hill, on the other hand, does an outstanding job with with the male voices and the narration. So, I'm wondering: Since it took a man and a woman to write this thrilling story, perhaps a man AND a woman should have been hired to read the audio version."
3,A book with two titles,"What a disapointment! I thought I'd found a new John Case book. Already in the first page I had a feeling that I had read this before. A page or two further and a search in my bookshelves brought me to Trance State by John Case.I will now look twice at any ""new"" titles from this author. This has never happended to me before. Tomorrow a trip back into the city to exchange."
3,fun,"Well, by the end of this book, I felt like I had just eaten cotton candy. Very bulky looking to begin with, but it all sort of evaporated by the end. Having said that, it was a quick and fun read with a clever premise. A secret organization with shadowing ties in the past to urban legend types of mind control research has kept this research alive and is using it to program assassins. Oh this is fun and presented well. I could hardly wait to turn the page and find out what would happen next. Thus, I was able to overlook a few big holes in the plot. Having said that, this was a fun read that I would recommend to anyone who needs something to kill a few vacation or airport hours."
3,A good conspiracy thriller fix,"""The Syndrome"" is a good, solid book - something that will get you through an afternoon in an airport or a doctor's office, and keep you up later than you planned that evening.It lacked the kind of roller-coaster, white-knuckle thrill that I always hope for in this kind of book, but it is good enough that I am looking forward to the next John Case novel.Thumbs up!"
2,Unbelievable and disappointing :-(,"John Case, the pseudonym for a husband and wife writing team that has turned out such incredible thrillers as ""The First Horseman"" and ""The Genesis Code"" have stumbled with their latest offering, ""The Syndrome"". Taking a viable scientific premise, implanted/recovered memory, and giving it a nasty twist, they create an incredibly promising start to a novel that spins its wheels and goes absolutely nowhere. And unfortunately, it takes a long time to get there. The characters are one-dimensional, and the way in which the story revolves around them seems lifeless, without any passion whatsoever. I had a very hard time caring about anything that happened to them, and wished they would just shut up and go away. Better luck next time!"
2,"Average, overrated","The characters weren't very believable and the plot had too many implausible twists and turns. Sorry, this one didn't cut the mustard with me."
2,Not his best by far,"Synopsis: Adrienne Cope and Jeffrey Duran are drawn into a web of intrigue and recovered memories as they both look into the death of Adrienne's sister and Jeffrey's psychiatric patient, Nico. They discover an international conspiracy and the drama ensues.My review:This book was pretty boring for the first 168 pages - that's when stuff finally started to get moving - 1/3 of the way through the book. I'd have dropped it long before that except that I'd alread read 'The Genesis Code' by this author and enjoyed it and was waiting for this one to improve. I really was disappointed.I give this book 2 stars. I would have given it a slightly better score but I know the author can do much better than this"
4,Glad I purchased,"I really like this book. It does a great job of breaking down critical information. It helps you retain this info by providing questions for each chapter as well as having NCLEX review questions at the end of the book. Lastly, it is very reasonably priced. I expect to continually refer to it throughout nursing school and possibly beyond."
4,electrolytes,"If a person doesn't understand fluids & electrolytes after reading this book, then give up!"
4,Interesting and accurate,"Years ago, TIME magazine had a cover article on the ""Battle in Seattle."" In the article, TIME had a map of downtown Seattle that marked certain high rise buildings. The building in which I worked every day was starred as ""Ground Zero"" for the Battle. When I watched the movie, it brought back my hassles of getting to and from work over the four demonstration days. Although I was in the midst of all the action, I didn't really understand the Battle in Seattle until I watched this movie. If you buy the DVD, as I did, be sure to watch the bonus features. One of the bonus features explains why the subject matter was chosen, how it was perceived by the writer and director, and most importantly, it explains very well the WHY of the Battle. I highly recommend the movie. I took one star off of my review because one of the characters was a shallow one played by an actress that didn't do a convincing job with the material she was given."
4,Great Film,"This is a great political/Economic Film despite its lower production cost than most films that may discuss the issue of the globalist market, and the use of some news footage, the actors were good. Most importantly it shows the power of people and population when they get more and more educated on what happens in this world. who knows what happens in the future but this film is a must for every activist or activist to be !!! NO WONDER WHY ITS ONLY AVAILABLE AT AMAZON !!!"
2,Where are the subtitles?,"This movie would have been more enjoyable if the claimed subtitles were available. Being hearing-impaired, I could not understand much of the dialogue. Maybe the movie had nothing interesting to say. People truely concerned about people should know this. The rioting and police action was a hoot!"
3,Ironic,"This movie is very slanted, and it's ironic that the liberals who support this movie's cause and dramatize it with the scene where the woman loses her baby to police violence also support abortion, which is fundamentally the same thing."
3,Exactly 10 Years Ago Fromn This Writing,"Having worked in Downtown Seattle when the WTO protests took place, I can vouch for the authenticity of the picture. As a matter of fact, the movie delves much too deeply into the ""whys"" and ""hows"" of the protests. I think that as a fact finding movie, it is alright. I think as a form of entertainment, it is rather lengthy. It could use an Oliver Stone treatment."
2,"Opportunities missed, could have been better.","I was trying figure out what happened to make this film such disappointment. My guess is Hollywood packaging of talent and concept. Both the idea and the cast deserve top rankings. But the script and execution were lost and confused, leaving me scratching my head. An opportunity lost on a great idea and top shelf cast."
3,Good,The movie is good. It sours the reality of a lot of Anarchist's and other protesters that were present. You should also get the book Battle og the story of the Battle of Seattle. It is put out by AK Press. Phenomenal read that pairs well with this movie. Link here: [...]
2,"Not Fictionalized, PURE FICTION","Like other reviewers, I was there. I worked across the street from Nike Town which rec'd a lot of the protester's wrath. The plot was very contrived. The peeps in the street were punks. I should have gotten off the bus on the way d/t that morning. Two kids got on and refused to pay the toll. They were having a stand-off w/ the bus driver who wouldn't move the bus if they didn't pay. Sitting by the door, I grabbed one kid's hat and threw it through the door. When the punk puffed up, I said I was buying it and offered to pay his fare. I had 10"" and 50lb on him. He got off that bus and we went d/t for an exciting day."
2,Weak and Flawed,"The only time the REAL issues of the Seattle protests are addressed are in the beginning credits and the ending credits, everything in between is weak and only marginally addresses the mass of protests and range of protesters who actually participated in the events. The film made it seem like the entirety of the events came down to one small group of people, which is a complete lie. A larger ensemble approach with various people representing various interests would have been a better way to construct the narrative."
4,Read this SOONER than later,"Sorry for the pun :-)Anyways, while the spirit of the 1889 Oklahoma Land Rush could have been better written, this book is a wonderful take on Tim Holt's attempts in establishing his newspaper business in Guthrie.Sadly, the turmoil that Cathy Martin undergoes in trying to become an actress takes away from the book."
2,glorious waste of time,"reading this will make you crazy. her other books are better, this was all over the place, I had to read and re read just to get the point."
3,It could be better,"This ballet, created in 1977, has ups and downs. The choreography and music follow the classic drama of Euripedes, in a stardard way. The prologue, with chorus dancers bringing Greek masks and the shady scenario, is interesting as a whole. We also have in mind that the video quality worsens some pieces. This is true for this ballet. The saturation to red color is a negative factor that impoverishes it. The final scene is very long, very boring. In spite of some imperfections, this ballet points out an impressive feeling of violence and sensuality. For that, this piece can be seen as a curious production filmed in the Republic of Georgia."
3,Kan Beter,I am satisfied with this product but the video quality could be better.This recording is dark and has low sharpness (the picture is not brilliant)compared with other DVD's and the normal picture on nowadays Flatscreen TV's.The Performing and Choreography is excellent.
2,Come on Apple we're paying for something better!,"When I recieved my first Ipod 20gb I was really disapointed with the case that came with it. Apart from killing the Ipods good looks I dropped it twice in the first two days because of the rather weak clip. Not only was I dissapointed with the above mentioned, but I couldn't believe that Apple made a case with no protection on the corners for a product that beggs care and attention. I don't know what the statistics are but there is a good chance that if the Ipod takes a fall it will hit the corner at some point in the disaster!When I recieved my new 40gb Ipod with the dock I couldn't believe that Apple were still sending this case out with a product of this class. Surely someone has made this complaint to the company during the last few years! I gave it a two only because the material it is made of is reasonable quality and it functions - if you dont drop it and are extremly careful when using the clip."
2,be careful!,"DON'T keep your baby in this carrier. It's like driving with your child in the front seat, airbag on and no seatbelt through heavy traffic. You are an accident waiting to happen. The Belkin wallet holder has much more padding but no belt holder. I haven't found the perfect holder yet but I'm still on the lookout. The ipod needs to be firmly secured with padding all around the edges, attatched to your body at all times, yet you have to be able to easily access the front of it. Get that perfect case on the market people!!"
2,"Not horrible, but not great, either","I bought this case from Apple when I ordered my iPod. I wish I'd waited. My 30 bucks would have bought a better case elsewhere, I now know.My biggest gripe with this case is that you have to remove the iPod from it before you can change any settings -- volume, song, on/off, etc. What a pain.Second gripe is that the clip doesn't feel very secure on my waistband. I end up putting it in a pocket for extra security. Otherwise, the case is sturdy, but boring."
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU VALUE YOUR IPOD,"Ok before i begin one thing DO NOT BUY. This is about the worst case you can buy for you ipod. It looks fairly stylish, but there are two huge flaws:1. You can't use it without pulling the case off2. ALERT ALERT ALERT ALERT ALERT ALERT ALERT ALERT ALERT ALERTThere is a tag on the side of the beltclip towards the top of the case that creates VERTICAL SCRATCHES as you pull the ipod out and put it back, which you have to do. Ok so scracthes on the back doesnt seem that bad but it adds up becomes quite horrible, it is even worse when you accidentaly put in in backwards. The tag will put SCRATCHES ON DISPLAY. Thanks to this flaw my ipod is scarred for life.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS CASE ANYTHING BUT THIS CASE NO CASE AT ALL IS BETTER THAN THIS"
2,Misleading sales pitch,"The lens is not bad, but while it is advertised as being a lens for the Sony DVD403, it fits only with an adapter (included) from 37mm to the 30mm used by the sony. It comes with 2 lens caps, but the adapter must be removed and stored separately to use the smaller of the lens caps. There is not a suitable place to store the adapter, so find your own. Had it been described fully, I would not have bought this model"
4,Inspiring,"Small Steps is an inspiring documentary about the struggles of the creation of an alternative high school within a large urban high school in NYC. We need more of these places, where kids count."
1,Boring and pointless,"I got this because I loved two of Tryon's other books--""The Other"" and ""Harvest Home"". The blurb on the back cover made it seem like a suspense tale. What it was was a generic coming of age story set in the 1920s and 1930s. The lady of the title is a mysterious women who lives all by herself in a huge house. She befriends a neighborhood boy and we see the story through his eyes and narration. It started out OK but soon got tedious and dull. The author goes into detail about events that (as far as I could tell) had little to do with the main story. The mystery about the woman is bought up occasionally but most of the book just drags on and on and ON about the kid and his family life and friends. Around the half way point I started just skimming just to get the book done. Then I realized that didn't help--I was STILL bored and could care less so I stopped reading. I don't feel I missed anything. Skip this one."
3,"I bought this book because I read Thomas Tryon first book : The Other, and really liked it.","Thomas Tryon's book ,""The other"" was a goodie and a coundn't put downer....but this one,:"" Lady"" was dull....I read it through tho....just a so so book. My order came quickly and in good condition....way to go Amazon. Just don't waste your time on this one."
1,Boring and Dated,"I was originally drawn to this book because the synopsis sounded intriguing and suspenseful. My husband informed me that the author had written another book called, ""The Other"", which was turned into a 70's horror film. Based on these circumstances, I decided to try ""Lady"", only to find it boring, not suspenseful in the least, and very dated. The ""terrible secret"" (which I will not give away) leads you to believe that there is some supernatural tale involved, when in fact, it is a dated, uninteresting ""surprise"" that has no bearing on the story. It seemed like everyone else who reviewed this book loved it, so I had to write at least one review to the contrary. I had an EXTREMELY difficult time finishing it, and struggled through it just to say I finished it. I found it the ""Secret"" very anti-climactic and pointless, and the synopsis on the back of the book very misleading."
4,An intensely memorable read,"Pure slasher fun, in the grooviest sense of the word. Had a great time reading Memoria. It's a fast-pace thrill ride that doesn't pull any punches. Osias is as wickedly clever a character as Herbert West, Reanimator. Kudos to Mr. Pepper for such a fun read. Looking forward to more."
5,Wow!,"I bought this book on a lark. I usually don't read this kind of book. I thought the story was really creative and different than anything I've ever read before. I felt SO bad for the Job character...I wont ruin it but I wanted to cry every time his parts of the story came up.Oh, and the ending is really awesome too. The horror and science fiction books that I have read are sometimes good for the first half and then have an ending that seems to come out of nowhere. Memoria ends with a great climax and the entire story is gripping."
2,Hoping For More,"I heard the tagline: What if you were trapped with your worst memories while your body continued without you on Earth and I expected a psychological thriller with supernatural overtones. What I got was a page turner that lacked substance. Many things were hinted at, but glossed over when more detail would've enriched the story. The characters were all angry, and bitter, moving from apathetic to rageful to plain mean, and were never fleshed out into people the reader can care about.The concept is fascinating, but never really explored except briefly through a mad scientist searching for the soul. There are passages that hint of a deeper meaning, but they're never developed and that left me disappointed.This could've been a great novel if more time had been put into developing the characters and the premise. As it is, the pace is fast and the story moves quickly. All in all an okay read, but I had hoped for more."
3,scoyy hamilton and friends,"I personally love ice skating; I think too much time was spent on the singer Feinsteine. If he so special let him have his own show, then see how many people tune in. The singing brought an overall Blah to the whole show. I give three stars because I know how hard these skaters train for their skating. I will say this, when Michael quit singing his piano playing was very good,I respect the time he put in learning to to this. But really when I buy a video about skating a want to see the skaters. I also don't like the fact; that the person emceeing is not a skater himself."
2,Too much music,"I bought this as a gift for my wife who is an avid skating and Scott Hamilton fan. She was disappointed that a good part of the skating performance is missed because the camera keeps cutting away to Michael Feinstein and his band. Both the music and skating are good, but the mixture of always switching from the skating to the music creates a sub par skating DVD. She did not find this fault with the tv performances of Scott Hamilton and Friends that were done as a charity event for cancer. In these shows, the camera kept the skating as its number 1 focus."
1,"More skating, less Feinstein",Please - a real figure skaing fan wants to see skating not Michael Feinstein hamming it up. Very disappointed in this DVD. This seems to be a trend - guess the real fans aren't protesting enough!!
4,good early primer,"This cd has a good introduction to medieval composer Leonin's music, but I don't think the Perotin selections live up to Perotin as well as other cd's of Perotin. The traditional chant on this cd provides a strong cultural context for the 2 composers featured here."
3,TOMAHAWK,"NOT BAD FOR $8.00 BUT ACTUAL LENGTH IS ONLY 12"" AND NOT 15""AS ADVERTISED. THIS IS A DISPLAY PIECE ONLY BUT ONCE AGAINFOR THE PRICE .....WATTA YA WANT!!??"
5,Visual FoxPro Report Writer,Very well written. It showed me exactly what I needed to know to make the Report Writer work for me.
2,Shipping Cost is Insane!,"I haven't actually received my cards yet so I don't know how good or bad they are. I have received an order confirmation indicating that they are charging $8.00 shipping for a $5.99 pack of printed release forms. To my mind that should be a criminal act. Printed forms aren't fragile. All they need to do is stuff them into an envelope and mail them out. Maximum cost should be no more than $2-3, not $8.00! Talk about a rip-off! I, for one, won't be buying this item again!"
5,Popol Vuh - 'Hosianna Mantra' (SPV),"Originally released in 1972, this being one of Popol Vuh's earlier efforts. Main reason I decided to check out this experimental / krautrock title was that - recently, I happened to purchase the Kawabata Makoto CD by the same name that was the Acid Mothers Temple's main player's personal tribute to Popol Vuh. Tracks that I got the most out of were ""Kyrie"", the ten-minute inspiring title cut ""Hosianna Mantra"", the truly innovative ""Segnung"" and the spine-tingling ""Nicht Hoch Im Himmel"" (just beautiful!). Personnel: Florian Fricke - cembalo, piano & percussion, Robert Eliscu (Between) - oboe, Fritz Sonnleitner - violin, Connie Veit (Gila) - guitars, Djong Yun - sax & vocals and Klaus Weiss - percussion & tamboura. Keep in mind that I've never been that huge of a Popol Vuh fan - but this work is truly ahead of it's time in every aspect. I like a lot of the other krautrock bands, both past and current. 'Hosianna Mantra' is a must-have."
1,Not To Be Mistaken As a Dive Guide!!,"The Amazon description of this book said it included ""locations"" of the dive sites. The Author furthers states the book includes ""access and location"" of the dive sites. Wrong and wrong. It's a good book for general information of the Bahamas and has some nice pictures but worthless as a guide to the dive sites. It is very safe to assume a purchaser of the book is a scuba diver and has plans to use it for that purpose. The advertising for this book should include a statement ""Coordinates Not Included"". While this book has some nice pictures and good general information about the Bahamas, most of the information is freely available on the internet. I purchased the book for the detail. Location of a dive site to me means how to get there and that would include GPS coordinates, at least. There are no compass bearings either. ""East Of Treasure Reef"", or ""The Next Mooring East From Site 3 Along The Inner Reef System"" doesn't cut it."
2,No GPS coordinates = no good.,"Any avid diver has heard of the wonderful diving just 2 miles off the south tip of the west end. And then you go driving around in your boat forever looking for it, stopping occasionally to stick your face in the water. 2 hours later and plenty pissed, you give up.GPS does away with all this. Dive bouy or no, you hit your spot first time every time. In fact with WAAS you can easily come within 15 feet of the mark with no problem. It borders on criminal to put out a dive book that has no GPS coordinates, and my printing of this book has none. Save your money until Lawson Wood gets a clue."
3,search for a better price guys,"I spose you can consider me a Shins fanboy, considering I atually bought their vinyls. I own this EP, and I have to say I was quite dissapointed by the New Slang with iron & wine recording. However it was a good buy for the price I got it...$4 in Kims in NYC, now I know not everyone lives outside a large city, but I'd reccomend searching for a better price, because I would never fathom paying over $10 for a single. Just do a little searching, you'll find it for a better price.PS: My nickname's not Shin because of 'The Shins', I'm not that much of a fanboy."
1,This not the original Animals and certainly not Eric Burdon.,"Don't be fooled, this is not Eric Burdon. The vocalist is actually Danny McCulloch, the one time bass player of Eric Burdon & The Animals. This collection has appeared on at least four other minor labels always disguised as The Animals. Danny McCulloch did resurface in 1991 as The New Animals with original members of the second Animals band i.e. Eric Burdon & The Animals. This group included guiterist Vic Briggs and drummer Barry Jenkins who actually replaced John Steele in the original Animals. I know at least some of these cuts are from this line-up. Despite the connection, it is a shameful attempt to cash in on the fame and sound of the original recordings."
1,"BAD,terrible don't buy if you want the originals","This Cd absolutely was horrible. I expected to get the original songs and these were all horrible.The song I really bought it for "" Don't let me be misuderstood"" in the original version has an awesome weird feel to it. The version on this album was terrible and sounds like bad video game music. Do not buy this album, whatever you do don't buy this!"
2,"Might have been a good book once, but needs to be updated","Short Version:This book is as of March 2005 outdated. Areas like queuing, encryption, DSL and VPN is not covered enough.Long Version:The book is as of March 2005 outdated. The book does not cover LLQ, CBWFQ and flow based WFQ. I did not find WRED but you need it. The DSL, cable modem and VPN section is not well covered. This book was probably not bad when it was written, but needs serious updating to comply with what you will be asked on the exam. I bought this book because the book from Ciscopress had a bad rating and this book did not have any, so I wanted to give it a shot. But I know now why often books have no reviews - because the review requires you to make your real name accessible to the public and I could imagine that some people do not want this."
1,Not hypo-allergenic,"I love the idea of MyChelle facial products. Unfortunately, they are not hypo-allergenic and I have sensitive skin. As a result, I ended up with flesh colored bumps all over my chin, jawline, and forehead. Needless to say, I returned the 2 bottles of Fruit Enzyme Cleanser to Amazon."
3,"Good cleanser, but they need to change their packaging.","This is a good cleanser. Smells good, and doesn't take all the oil out of your face. Does not give the squeeky clean feeling, but that it not suppose to be good for your skin. My major complaint is that they store these in cheap plastic bottles. Couldn't they put these in glass bottles that is safe from chemicals leeching into our bodies? The fact is, anything stored in plastic, will have chemicals that can leech into the product if 1. stored in their for long periods of time, 2. if put into hot or frozen temperatures, or if it reacts with the substance inside. There are also different types of plastic that are safer than others, but I am not sure what plastic they use. Irregardless, it's plastic, and more likely contains BPA, a carcinogen. If they would only change their packaging, I would be a happy camper."
4,"Nice Filter, Takes Practice","The misty spot filter has come in very handy for me when working weddings and bridal portraits. It takes some practice to adjust to where the sharp zone of the filter is as opposed to where the blur begins. I'd recommend reviewing your pictures on your LCD screen closely to make sure you've got the subject sharp where you want it to be sharp. As a matter of fact, that difficulty is the only reason I give it four stars instead of five. It certainly lives up to the reputation of quality I've come to expect from Hoya filters."
4,The Hidden,This was a gift for someone who is currently serving a prison sentence. I don't know whether he liked it or not.
4,Excellent read!,"I happened to find this book on a library shelf and am very pleased that I did! I stayed up until 1 am this morning finishing it. There is a lot to this book and I really enjoyed the Christian aspect of it. It was very subtle, not at all preachy. The only downside that I can think of is that I had a really hard time deciding if I liked the main character, Susan, or not. The story is told from many points of view and when the author writes from Susan's point of view, you can understand her motives but when written from Melissa's point of view, you start to hate Susan so much that it creates division in the story. A subtle negative but one that made the book a 4 instead of a 5 for me. The rest of the book is great, I had a great time trying to figure out how Jacob was and was pleased with the way the book resolved. Well worth the read!!"
2,I'm so confused!,"This was not an ""easy read."" In fact I did not finish the book because I like my fiction to entertain me & this did not. It seemed like more of a ""scifi"" book than Christian fiction, which is how it was billed. The characters were not believable, in my opinion."
4,Keeps ya guessing.,"We just read this for our Friday Night Book Club. I really enjoyed it and could hardly put it down, as it kept me guessing on what was really going on. Great book!"
2,2 holes instead of 1,"It's a cheap hood, but the picture and description says that is 1 hole and when I got it i was surprised to see that it has 2 holes...I simply kept it with me because is more expensive to return it than what it was."
4,"It works, but it stinks, too","Got this for my boyfriend, who lives in Pittsburgh, back in February. He says it works well enough to keep his face warm when it's snowing, but after a few weeks, even after repeated washings, it started to stink pretty badly. He wore it pretty often until he got a new one. For what it's worth, when I realized I needed a balaclava too, I decided to not buy a second of these. It's very good for the price, though."
5,Great for under bycycle helmet,"I wanted this ski mask for bycycling in the cold , windy weather of the suburbs of Philadelpa, Pa.What I liked most about it was that I could wear my helmet over the mask, as it is not too bulky, but cuts the wind just fine.I have worn it several times, and have not experienced any odor problems as reported by others.Very pleased with it"
3,Nothing new here.....,"This book in all fairness is accurate, but nothing in it was really ""new"". It has advice like ""don't go to the grocery stores before meals (when you are hungry) and eat as little FAT in your diet as possible. There aren't any gimmicks in it, it just suggests to eat a low fat diet and exercise, but we don't need a book for that. I thought this book was going to talk more about Foods that actually help accelarate fat burning in our body, if you are looking for that try Foods That Cause You to Lose Weight : The Negative Calorie Effect by Neal D. Barnard, Neal, MD, It's also sold here on amazon. I would pass on this book, because although it is true, it's not something you need to buy because it's all info we've all heard before."
4,Veils of Fun,Free Fall is the best of the series. Jasmine Cresswell does an fantastic job as always of creating a terrific whodunit with so many twists and turns you won't guess to the very end. B.J. Daniels was okay but like her other novels better.
5,Good... seems to stop rocks and trees from going into my brain,"What can I say? It fits well, it's not too uncomfortable when crashing into things. The styling is also tasteful and low-key and should look good for some time to come. Actually this helmet is more rounded in the back, which seems to be the fashion, whereas many helmets have Hermes-esque aerodynamic shapes protruding.Speaking of plumage, the helmet I really liked was the Bell Influx, but it looked HUGE in the mirror -- all that sculpting meant extra foam and plastic jutting everywhere. The Bell helmets are also flat on the roof, which is bad for folks with pointy heads; the Giros seem to have a vent running down the top ridge which is more comfortable.Plus, I've had some nice-to-meet-yous with hard objects and I can vouch for its effectiveness."
3,Par for the course,"The disc was purchased for 'Rio De Majo', an exceptionally beautiful bossa nova. 'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso' is also of interest. The rest was well-crafted but uninspiring standard fare."
1,Need the Other Three!,"I'm an English teacher in Taiwan and I've found the full four-book set to be the best Chinese course available anywhere. Unfortunately, this book alone is probably just a waste of time and money."
2,I bought ten of these,"I bought ten of these a few years ago. I was told when I bought them by the guy who recommended them to me that they were cheap and some failed from the start, but the price was the lowest possible. He was honest. I didn't have any fail right away, but have had three have noisy fans and one fail completely. They can get you by and were good enough, barely. I was replacing the power supplies in dell optiplex 260's. I had to cut the Dell's case to get them to fit. (Dell uses a non standard format. The Dell's power supplies had a similar quality to these. The Dell's never got noisy, they just failed. These worked better, but they main fan on them got really noisy on a high percentage. Good enough for a low end PC but it will probably require replacing in a couple of years or less."
3,"Good Start, bad finish","I got this drum set in the summer of 07. I got it set up, watched the instructional start DVD and started playing. First for you to know, the stand on the picture doesn't have a boom holding your cymbal. The drum heads wear and buying more is wasting your money. The snare doesn't sound like a lightning crack, more like a bop. The cymbol will bend and looks like a drooping hat. Trust me, I know-it's what mine is doing. The pedal is a 4 out of 10 star, it comes loose and is weak. The base is o.k. but I had to put a pillow in the base to make it sound like a Tama. The high-hat is the worst thing you ever saw. It is good at first but bends after 3 months and the screw holding it up never holds it up while you are playing. The Toms are fine but could be better."
2,Not their best release.,"Not as good as some earlier releases. Here we have an attempt to elevate their sound with a sort of choral/string quartet grandeur, but it results in rather amauterish, aimless song constructions with snob appeal.Stars Of The Lid has produced a similar, much better sound with their past albums that were strictly electronic. Try those."
3,I'm not sure I get it,"I bought this Cd based on a review on Popmatters and also seeing it with an almost perfect 100 rating on Metacritic. I'm a fan of electronic music, I dig Underworld, I even like Moby's abient disc included with 'Hotel'.This Cd is even more sedate than that disc, if you can imagine. I like it Ok, but it functions only as non-challenging background music. I like it fine, but no songs really jump out at you. Disc 2 seems to be a little more 'peppier', if you could use that term."
3,"Good, but not as good as the others....","Is it just me, or is the author Miss Ross determined to pair up each of her major characters? I really enjoyed this novel, even if, for the most part, nothing really happened. Miss Julia is determined to throw a wedding for her boarder Coleman, and the town lawyer Binkie. Meanwhile, her husband's ex-mistress Hazel-Marie is still dating Mr. Pickins and Little Lloyd is still a nervous (but likeable) little boy.There is an escaped criminal, Dixon Hightower to worry about, and new problems associated with the ""Family Life Center."" Miss Julia is being courted by Sam (a prospect I'm lukewarm about), and she's involved with the Preacher's wife and several small incidents.Overall, this was a cute story, but not as good as the first two. Personally, while I enjoy the romantic elements, I'm not very keen on every character getting paired up. Miss Julia is more interesting to me without Sam, and without Mr. Pickins. I guess I like my heroines single-and-sassy."
1,For those fond of anachronisms and outdated stereotypes&#65533;,"...I was looking for a light read that would keep me amused for awhile and this looked like it would do the trick. I was sorely disappointed. Miss Julia is the anachronism, a church lady busybody straight out of 1962, but living in 2002,judging by the mention of Game Boys and Britney Spears. Miss Julia's housekeeper, Lillian, is the outdated stereotype. She is a black mammy character straight out of Gone With the Wind, dialect and all. Ann B. Ross should be ashamed of creating such a character in the 21st century."
3,Aunt Bea with spunk,"Honestly at first this book was slow at the beginning, but the more I got into it, I began to enjoy it. Miss Julia really has spunk."
1,So bad the dog won't eat it.,"I have tried all the Nesco jerky flavors and Pepperoni is the flat-out worst! It's so bad no one would eat it and we are jerky fanatics. The flavor is hard to describe (think cleaning detergents). Regardless, it tastes nothing like pepperoni. Jerky is a fun, protein-rich snack and the rest of the Nesco flavor line is pretty good (Original Flavor is the family favorite), just avoid pepperoni or be ready to throw out a few pounds of jerky."
1,Another Resume Book,"This book is chock full of different resumes like so many others on the market. Be advised that the primary focus of the book is on NOT designing layout and design of resumes, but on how to write or format one based on the many examples. The title is somewhat misleading."
2,A commendable effort marred by poor intonation,"The music of La Rue is not as well-known as it should be, but perhaps the next wave of early music recordings will rectify this. The music, especially the Lamentations, is somber and haunting, with some arresting (and forward-looking) chromaticisms. I wanted to like this CD, but unfortunately this ensemble is plagued throughout by noticeably sour intonation, especially the baritone (Billingsley). This has the effect of making one extremely uneasy and edgy while listening: the sublime harmonic progressions that are the core of this music miss their mark and never quite jell. That's really too bad, because Moll's reading is largely competent and emotive. Wait for another recording."
5,Great product!,Great product for a great price! I got mine back in 2009 and have LOVED it ever since I've gotten it! HIGHLY recommended.
5,Great,Fast shipping and just what my parents wanted for Christmas. Now everyone is wanting one like this. I think it would have been even better if it could hold even more drinks.
2,It's okay,One side of thew vending machine stopped working.It was good while it lasted.I would not recommend it. It
2,So So,I brought the blue one and the red one and I thought it would make my pops cold no matter where I placed the machine in my house even on the front porch where its cold my pops never get very cold in the red one or blue and I empty the water out the bottom every 2 weeks no thank you. I need to find something better. I love my pops cold like the vending machine cold pops.
4,Product review,"This is a very good value for the money, and the product is excellent. This product is for those who understand its use in health, and I would advise any potential user to review the use of this amino acid."
4,The Scholarly Versus The Popular,"I have not completed this book, but expect to read it all the way through. While the prose is not sparkling, the research is solid. The conclusions draw from the research are not fanciful, far-fetched, or outlandish. Other baseball biographies might learn from this restraint and from this decorum.Another Ruth biography I read, which shall remain nameless, mildly derided this volume for being ""too scholarly."" Which of the half-dozen or so respectable Ruth biographies would The Bambino himself read? Likely none of them, for we have no reason to believe he was much of a reader. But, perhaps, least likely of all this book from a history professor who taught at Notre Dame.I am looking forward to finishing this book, and glad that ""baseball publishing"" has room at the bar for all tastes and sorts of literature, from the slapdash popular, to the considered and the ""scholarly."""
4,"Slow start, but has promise","Fisher has a style of writting such that you can't be impatient for action when you read. A lot of time is spent setting up the characters and the situation; which gives the series a wonderful beginning.. but makes this first book a somewhat slow read. The hundreds of pages cover a scant amount of days, if that tells you anything.Still, the book was worth reading and I look forward to reading the second of the series. The writting is well-done and the story definately has potential. When things started happening at the end, I was definately left with a feeling of wanting more."
2,Judging a book by its cover.,"The magnificent cover art by Michael Whelan captured my attention for this book, the debut novel of Jude Fisher and the first volume of a projected trilogy.Unfortunately I found SORCERY RISING difficult to sink my teeth into. There seemed to be too many characters and too little driving action for me to latch onto. The central characters seemed dreadfully stereotyped, particularly the baddies.However, I have read the blurb for Volume Two, FOOL'S GOLD, which seems to pick up the pace a little, particularly by concentrating on the enigmatic Rosa Eldi, the seductive amnesiac femme fatale featured in Whelan's painting. I have also been reading encouraging reviews from other readers here which suggest that the series is worth hanging in there for. Maybe other discouraged readers of this promising novel will do what I am doing - reserving final judgement until all three volumes are out and reading them together. At the least I will enjoy poring over the new Whelan covers."
5,A Technical Page-Turner!,"I purchased this book primarily to use only 2 chapters. But in glancing over its introduction, I found it so much more clear and concise than any other book I've used that I am actually reading it cover-to-cover. I have a small library of books on NT and networking topics, but none covers even the most complex issues - TCP/IP, WINS, DHCP, RRAS - with such clarity or with such a focus upon essential and useful information. As another reviewer says, you'll keep looking at this one so often that you might wear it out."
5,Better than Devil May Cry!,"This game is simply better than Devil May Cry. Sure, Devil May Cry might be the original and more famous, but Chaos Legion is also made from Capcom which makes Chaos Legion like a brother to Devil May Cry. So, if you are a owner of Devil May Cry, this game is MUST HAVE!!!"
2,devil may cry?,this games graphics are the only thing like devil may cry the game play [is awful] the game has no story plot. the only reason i give it 2 stars is because when i first bought it with silent hill 3 i though this game was awsome the first day then when i played it the next day i realy got into it and realized that this game wasnt as good as when i first played it. if you want a good game buy silent hill 3. dont waste your money on this [junk].
3,looks cool,Alright everyone righting a review is like this game gets 5 stars because it looks. Man you gotta play the game first before you rate it. I mean what if the camera angle is wrong or the controls are horrible.. That is the downfall of alot of games that look so so cool give me a break. I mean devil may cry was a great game then everyone thought the second one would be great but it [was bad] compared to the first one you just dont know...
2,Fun But ....,"It's brilliant game and fabulous ideas were it's only action fight game similar to devil may cry but bad graphics and design though besides no story line at all. The more you push buttons the more you will be winning. once you unlock the 14 levels, the game becomes invincible were all your power you got by playing will be nothing and it's just like starting all over were the new enemies really makes a HUGE damage and it's impossible to beat. In this point it becomes boring and you'll be starting to find cheats. I used to LOVE this game and I've played it long time back but didn't reach this point but now I felt it was a complete waste of time. See it on youtube and find out if it worth buying it. To me no."
3,"Good, but lacking game.","Pros: Chaos Legion is fun, challanges you, has a fairly good story line, and great music.Cons: Repetitive enemys, poor and anoying voice acting, camera makes you motion sick, the game felt too short, and no stratagy reallyAll and all it's not a bad game, it's cheap, fun, easy to get a hang of, I wouldn't recomend it for those that like puzzles, but for those that simply wish to beat the crud out of something.Hope this helps you all."
2,Devil may cry copycats?,"Wow. is there anyhting good about this game? The fighting is awful, so is the plot, graphics, sound, voice acting, duration. Tries to be cool like Devil may cry, but makes the game all the more stupid. The worst level design!"
3,Well what can i say it's fun but!! it's no classic.........,"Chaos legion definitely is a fun game but!! some how i think that this game lacks substance to give it the kind of appeal like a DMC OR MGS , i feel it has no genuine replay value, the graphics are great but!!! after a while it's just a brawlers haven, if this game had came OUT before DEVIL MAY CRY i may have like it a little more but didn't!!! and i can't say this is classic,,, borrow this but don't buy this it's limited, banal, trite and feeble.it has it's momment but that all try MSG3 laterzzz folks / gamers"
4,kinda good,well i am kinda disapointed that the story line is weak. Its alot like DW4 but with legions instead of gaurds. The demons are a little to difficult but with the right legion you can beat them. I would rent this game and see how you like it before buying it.
3,Nice little novella,"As a long-time avid fan of Curtiss Ann Matlock, I sat down with this book, a bowl of buttered popcorn, and a large sweet tea, anticipating entering the world of richly-drawn, sometimes-quirky characters who come alive due to Matlock's skill with the written word. It pains me to say this, but this book didn't provide that experience at all. Instead, the plot was painfully predictable, the conflicts both weak and cliched, and the characters not at all well-developed. In fact, one of the high-lights of the book, for me at least, was the brief description of the living quarters located in the rear portion of the 18-wheeler's cab! This is an okay *short* novel but certainly not typical (thank goodness) of Matlock."
5,Wonderful!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a great story, with characters who you feel like you know, and beautiful illustrations. I can't say enough about this book - it's wonderful!!"
4,I like it!,"So when I first opened the packaging, it looked more pinkinsh than coralish. I have combination skin which is on the oily side in summer, so as the day went on the blush got really really dark. This blush is definitely very pigmented. Then I changed my blush brush and applied very little and WOWWWW...it lasts all day and looks PERFECT! At first I thought it wasn't enough product for the price...but now that I know how much to use...I think the quantity is good for the price. I literally just touch the blush lightly on the product. Will def try other shades and repurchase this again :-)"
2,Product not received but charged to my credit card.,"I didn't receive the product. I received a notification via e-mail explaining that there was a mistake in the address, however, there is a charge to my credit card. Please help me to reverse the transaction."
3,somewhat disappointed,"This heatrate monitor doesn't give you your heart rate percentage, for example, your working out at 85% of your maximum heartrate, which is very helpful info. If I did it again, I choose another monitor that does."
2,Learn to count your pulse.,You can find your pulse in your wrist rather reliably. Count all the beats in a 15 second period and multiply that times four. There you have your current heart rate for one minute (beats per minute).Or... you can buy this over-priced toy. It was quite unreliable in measuring beats per minute when it would communicate with the chest strap at all. It feels cheaply made.I sent mine back.
1,I never obtained the product,Hello I cannot never give to them to no information on the product since not it recibi
2,Can I get a heart beat?,"This worked wonderful for the first 2 weeks, but into my third week, the heart beat monitor was having a hard time keeping my pulse. It would come in and out during my workout. This made it very difficult to know what my average heart rate was during my workouts. I know, you might say .. he must be 400 lbs. I am 5'11"" 200 lbs, so in my opinion it should not of been any problem in holding my pulse.It is very easy to use... if you can get it to work."
2,Polar B3 Heart Monitor dissapointment,"I was extremely dissapointed to find that my old A3 monitor that needed replacing was more functional than this new B3 model. I felt it was deceiving that the same number was used on a new model that didn't have the same features. The old A2 is the same as the new B3, neither of which shows the percentage of max heart rate which I've found to be very useful."
4,Good basic heart rate monitor.,"This is a good basic heart rate monitor. It includes a watch function, making it useful beyond the exercise monitoring. Plastic strap is not very comfortable, or I would rate it 5 stars."
5,Simply Splendid,"Anything Umphrey's is going to be wonderful, but this CD is spectacular. It's not ""Songs for Older Women"" mind you, but it'll be bring a smile to any fan's face. If you're a fan and you don't own this, buy it. Now."
5,Just what I ordered,The text book was what I needed for a grad. level course for the summer. It came on time for me to start the class. I was very satisfied.
5,D generation proves rock is not dead,"the 3rd of dgen's full length albums, once again hits hard. dgen combines the power and emotion of punk rock with melody and attitude. If you buy this album clear a few more spaces in your collection, because you'll soon be buying their early albums too. I love this band Vampire Nation Fan site!"
4,Definitely a pleasure and not a curse to listen to!,"Eden's Curse totally caught me by surprise.I had never heard of them before until I saw the ""if you like (blank), then you will like Eden's Curse"" sidebar in iTunes. I can't remember for the life of me who I was listening to to be referred to Eden's Curse, but they couldn't have been as good as this band!Eden's Curse is a melodic metal band in the vein of Jaded HeartTrustand Harem ScaremHigher.This self titled album is seriously good! Great hooks and awesome production. The background vocals are big and that is always a good thing. If you love melodic metal with a bit of sugar on it, then Eden's Curse should be on your Christmas list!"
1,It's a consesus - DON' T BUY THIS ONE!!!,"I have to agree with all about flawed design of this mini-bike. I have this same bike - different brand name but the EXACT same model(which make one wonder...). I kept hearing a scraping sound when I used it. I realize that is was the belt rubbing against the edge of the spoke. It eventually came off all together. The design makes it impossible to open it up and fix it (it's bolted together, literally). To top it off, there's no way to contact the manufacturer at all - no phone number, just a P.O. Box to order more stuff. Fortunely, I didn't pay SRP for it as I bought it new at an online auction. I'm now going to buy a real stationary bike. I don't have room for it but a least I know it tried and true."
5,ANOTHER GREAT LEATHERMAN,Well Leatherman did it again with the Juice series. I actually was not going to buy any of the Juice series multitools as I did not like the look and thought they would be to small for any sort of real use. Boy was I wrong. I initially bought the Juice S2 than the C2 and now the CS4. I absolutely love them all and ended up carrying the CS4 as it has the most tools. I was worried about buying the CS4 as the weight might of been to much for a pocket EDC (Every Day Carry) but I do not even feel it in my pocket. It feels very well made and sturdy and all the tools can actually do some work. Don't go thinking your going to change the world with this thing but it will accomplish most small to medium tasks you throw at it. I would highly suggest anyone looking for a pocket multitool to buy one of the juice series tools. I could not imagine a day without having my CS4 with me.
4,The Juice is Just Great.,"These pocket mutli-tools are great little gadgets that you never think about until you need one, but don't have one. I use mine at least 3-4 times every week. The quality is very good for its size. I always get a kick out of solving small problems with this thing... :)Didnt give it a 5 star because I don't like the fact that the blades do not lock when extended (like the full size models)."
4,Good Tool for the Price,"This tool have all of the features that I need in a not overly bulky size. Two criteria of my search for a multi-tool were a corkscrew and scissors, of the features that are not common with smaller-sized tools, both of which seem to work pretty well so far.However, I can completely understand how some users are not confident of the strength of the corkscrew. The user must be very careful to keep the tool straight when using the corkscrew so as not to snap it off (which seems to be fairly easy to happen)"
2,Unacceptable,"The blade has an EXCESSIVE amount of wobble, and the handle scale on the blade side is loose. The flathead screwdrivers are ridiculously hard to deploy. It appears that the rivet that secures the screwdrivers is too tight and the one for the blade too loose. Of course, you can't adjust this because the idiot designers used rivets in the first place instead of screws. I got one, and thought it was a fluke, so I exchanged it. The second one was the same garbage. Lest you think I am a malcontent, I am satisfied with my Juice S2. The pliers are good, but overall, the CS4 is not worthy to be on my belt or yours if you plan to use it."
2,Just got mine an hour ago from Amazon,"Started off with a positive attitude until I got to the screwdrivers. After breaking my thumbnail in a couple places I finally gave up and got a small screwdriver in order to pry up any of the 3 blades. I've worked them back and forth and still the same. The smallest is the worst, no way to flip it up with a fingernail. The Phillips head on the other end is just fine. Guess I'll Email Leatherman tomorrow, if possible, and see what they say. I bought this under my wife's account, so if the review is under her name, let it be known we are talking a man's somewhat bigger, tougher thumbnail, not hers."
4,Burn Pads,"I wish they came with more burn pads. On Saturday, I got a second degree burn on my arm (on my elbow joint it really hurts). Anyway, I apply a new one of these burn pads daily. It really stings when I put them on but once I apply a nexcare wrap to it, it feels much better. These burn pads are helping my second degree burn heal nicely."
5,Great for toddlers,"I bought these for my toddler a little after she turned one. I also bought spill proof paint cups and a toddler watercolor paint set. I wanted to get solid colored brushes that matched the paint cups to help her learn her colors, but now I'm glad I didn't. She has a blast painting with these things. They are also great for children with special needs. When using these brushes you will need to use a heavy duty paper. Since the brushes are so big they hold alot of paint so they will soak or weigh down light weight paper. I used computer paper the first time and could barely peel my daughters artwork off the table. Overall, this product is a great first paint brush set."
3,Beautiful but beware of the page breaks,"I have an early full-size edition of this book, and do not regret the purchase. However purchasers should be aware that many of the best views are marred by the big vertical page break right through the central part of the image.To really appreciate the images it might be best to get a derivative work (like some of the calendars) which allow one to see images unmarred by the page breaks.I hope the publishers read this sometime and reformat the book to avoid this issue. The images are so beautiful that they deserve it."
3,less National Geographic than Propoganda,"While the photography is breathtaking I could do without the descriptions that accompany the photos; all of which are less educational than condescending to the book's Western audience.Today's excerpt:Photo is of a basilica in Yamoussoukro (the capital city) of Ivory Coast""Having begun as a potentate's fancy, it (Yamoussoukro) may become a true metropolis. The masters always feel a slight fear before the masses of the disenfranchised, and choose to transfer their administration and court to a calm place where they can forget the wretchedness of their subjects. Such is the story of Versailles, Potsdam, Washington and Canberra.""Still like the pictures though; )"
5,"The best, refreshing to your senses...!","This book is extremely well edited. As for the end user, it really gives you a great sense of the earth, and all the beautiful scenes and unique views. It really relax you, while gives you a perspective to the good things in life."
4,Great Coffee Table Book,This is a wonderful coffee table book that will truly widen your perspectives of the world. Great conversation piece. A neat gift idea for all!
5,Not just for the coffee table,We saw the works displayed at the Jardins du Luxembourg in the middle of a summer night last week and were blown away. Highly recommend this man's work to all the world!
3,not very good for developing perspective,"It is tough to find a theme in this book. The pictures are pretty but the choice of subjects seems random and there is no consistency to the altitudes chosen. Some photos could have been taken from a crane or a very low-flying helicopter; others from quite high up. I like to fly in small airplanes in order to see how glaciers connect to rivers connect to oceans, for example. The photos in this book, by contrast, are very disorienting."
5,It will endlessly amaze you!,"I first saw the work of this super talented photographer in the wee hours of August 20th, 2000 outside Palais du Luxembourg in Paris. I was so fascinated by the colors, the angles, the beauty, and the emotions conveyed that I pledged to get a copy of the book as soon as I returned to the US. The pictures portray everyday places and people that seem out of this world when viewed through the lens of Arthus-Bertrand. The photographer and his staff really did their homework when putting together the captions that accompany the pictures. They have gathered information on geography, history, ecology, anthropology, economics, sociology, politics, and popular culture to describe the sites, hence increasing our awareness of our precious and wondrous yet fragile world. Earth from Above will never make it to my bookshelf because it's so fascinating that I keep it out on my living room table to share the wonder!"
4,Great for historical fiction lovers,"Persia Woolly does a great job in making life in early Britain and the story of Guinevere come alive. Her characters are believable, captivating and generally sympathetic. The story dragged a bit in a few places, but not enough to make me put the book down although, admittedly, I seldom do not finish a book. I read the 2nd book before this one, and will read it again and undoubtedly get more out of it; then on to the 3rd one."
4,No one else tells the story this way,"The Arthur and Camelot legend has been told and re-told enough times to make everyone despair of an original telling. This fits the bill. Gwen has a personality that the reader can identify with and root for. Arthur as the High King is perhaps a little too remote and aloof, but with the story told through Gwen's eyes this makes sense.I purchased this book on sale and didn't regret a penny (in fact I would have spent more). I was entranced enough to purchase the second and third books because I knew that I needed to finish the series and see how Camelot came to fruition and then ruin."
3,Nothing Extraordinary here,"I can't recall all the different versions of the Arthurian tale I have read to date. Honestly, at times they start to run together - especially if there is nothing to set my current read apart from those of the past. Though I found Woolley`s version entertaining I found myself struggling to finish Child of the Northern Spring because there was nothing new or spectacular about this telling of the familiar tale. I think I may be tainted by all my past reads :)."
4,Child of the Northern Spring,"Child of the Northern Spring, the first in a trilogy, covers Guinevere's early years, narrated by the Princess herself. I am impressed at how Ms. Persia Wooley made Gwen a believable narrator that readers can connect with, for I found this Gwen a sincere young woman who is, at first, reluctant to leave her life for the ways of the court. Gwen is the modest little tomboy who eventually grows up and weds who will be the greatest king of all Britain. The reader can laugh, cry, and smile with Gwen (who, in this book, is not an arrogant prick like most people picture Guinevere) all throughout the book as she meets characters like an Irish lad Kevin, the powerful Lady Morgan, and the stately Queen Igraine. I am impressed by Wooley's first book in the trilogy, and I am looking forward to reading the others!"
5,Guinevere Trilogy,This trilogy is absolutely amazing. This was the first I had read of King Arthur and Guinevere and I have never found another book to match it. I can't recommend the series enough.
3,Child of the Northern Spring,"Okay, I don't have much to say about this so this will be really short...Story starts when Guinevere is a child, the Romans has left and the Saxons are coming. Arthur isn't King yet and there is no round table. I liked that there's no dragons, magic or anything like that but it's more based on fact.I like that Guinevere is strong and independet who loves horses but the first half of the book was rather boring. It gets better after she mets Arthur. And the time jumps were annoying! I don't like when time jump happens and it's not clearly stated and you spend 2 pages wondering what the hell is going on.This was a good start in a series and I'm curious to see how the story continues and hoping there's more action in the future!"
2,Child of the Northern Spring,Too much detail of locations and trivial facts with not enough substance of plot or story line. No real peak or ending to the tale.
3,Fairly well written with an interesting spin on a classic tale,"Child of the Northern Spring is an easy read, and has a new take on a beloved tale. Worth the read."
2,Child of the Northern Spring,I find it rather boring because it's slow going. Lots and lots of description of scenery. Not much action that holds ones attention. I don't plan on reading the second and third books in the trilogy.
5,good book,"well written ""Arthur and Guinevere' book. If you like the subject you will enjoy this book. I read it on my Kindle paying only $3.99 for it...good bargain!"
3,good book,"This was a good book, but not good enough to make me want to spend $20 to buy the next two books of the trilogy."
4,Beautiful writing...little slow not much to keep you wanting to read more.,"I really liked the story line of Child of the Northern Spring, Woolley created beautiful rich characters and her writing was wonderfully descriptive so that I was able to envison the story as it went on. My only issue with the novel was that it seemed to drag on, nothing of great importance happens throughout the novel and when something does happen it seems to be overlooked. I am normally a very fast reader but this book took me a very long time to get through. I am considering reading the next two in the Trilogy, but decided to take a break for right now, it is something that I may come back to later on."
2,Wonderful Title,"The book was so boring that I couldn't really get into it. The multitude of references to dark religion was too much. I started out just looking beyond the references at the beginning, thinking that eventually the story would develop more substance, but it never did. Just put it down finally."
3,Great reworking of a classic,"I will start this review by saying that I don't normally read or like historical fiction. However, I found this book easy to read and the characters well developed. I found this an interesting take on the classic tale of King Arthur. I will be reading the other two books in this series. I especially enjoy the portrayal of Queen Gwen."
5,Child of the Northern Spring.,I really enjoyed this historical novel (my favorite kind) and looking forward to reading the other 2 books in this trilogy.
4,I liked it.,I have read a few Arthurian novels and I liked this one as well as most others. I like the perspective of Guineveres view of things.
4,Best of the Guinevere background stories,Different take on the Guinevere / King Arthur story. This covers her childhood and provides excellent background for the rest of the story. Well written with especially lovely descriptions of the countryside and well researched as to everyday life in those times. I will purchase the rest of the series if they are as good.
4,:) !!!!!,"It's hard finding good posters in stores now. I was worried if I ordered them online, they would have to be folded and such for shipping, but my deftones poster was in perfect condition, rolled neatly into.....well I don't know what it's called but I was very happy to receive my deftones poster!!!!"
2,Not Bobby Darin,"I viewed the movie at the theater, not knowing that Spacey could sing and expecting him to lip sync to Darin's actual recordings. Now Spacey is a good singer , perfectly serviceable, but he wasn't more than a few notes into the opening track of ""Mack the Knife"" when I leaned over to my companion and whispered, ""that's not Bobby Darin"". The character Polly, early in the film, says to a young Darin that you have to have ""it"" to be a star, and Spacey, at least as a singer, doesn't have ""it"". There are only a few times on this album that Spacey approach's Darin's level of talent. Having said that, why would you buy this album when you can get the real thing???"
5,Spacey can sing,"This will be brief becuase, simply put, Kevin Spacey makes the movie by actually singing the hits rather than miming to some other talent.IT was quite a surprise and is a wonderful sound track. Highly recommended."
5,Beyond The Sea Audio CD,Very nice. I knew after seeing the movie I'd want the soundtrack. The production work is fantastic!
2,"Sorry, Kevin; mediocre at best.",Go to a record store. Pick up this CD. Then pick up one by the real Bobby Darin. Then compare them. It doesn't take a rocket scientist.
2,Can you mix out the vocals?,"Verbal Kint.John Doe.Lester Burnham.BOBBY DARIN?? Can you say, ""CAREER SUICIDE?""I just did."
5,the more I play it the better it gets,I have almost worn this CD out. Spacey is great! The music is extrordinary! I just love it. Like the movie too!
5,"Wow!, Kevin Spacey sure CAN sing!","I was at the Dollar Tree getting some school supplies for my nephews and came across this great CD! 18 great Bobby Darin classic sang by the one and only Kevin Spacey. It's the soundtrack to the film ""Beyond The Sea"" which I also enjoyed. I got two copies, one for my dad, who introduced me to the music of Bobby Darin and one for me. You cant beat $1 for a great CD, and it's produced by Phil Ramone and it's on the Rhino/Atco label. This CD is a class act all the way!"
2,Not worth it,"If you are buying a 10 gb iPod, I wouldn't suggest spending $40 on this small piece of plastic. While this is a nice and handy product made by apple, the price is to big to make it worth it. If you're buying a 15, 20, or 40 gb, you get a dock already included, along with a remote, a carrying case, and more hardrive space. But buying a dock separately is a waste of money. It does include an audio out jack, but the headphone out is just as goodI made my own dock for myself out of wood and painted it. It looks nice or nicer than the Apple dock and is just slightly less functional. All the dock does is make the iPod stand up instead of lying there.If you want a dock, I'd suggest making your own or buying a 15, 20 or 40 gb iPod with the dock included as well as many other goodies that make it worth spending $100 extra."
3,considering the dock...,If you are considering the 15GB ipod you might as well get the 20GB ipod which gives you a dock. This dock is about 38 dollars and the 15GB ipod is about 250 dollars which adds up to 288. A 20GB ipod is 275 on amazon...so make good decision. But if you already have an ipod then u don't have to worry about the cost. Just get the dock.
1,Doesn't do much.,"As someone else pointed out, ""All the dock does is make the iPod stand up instead of lying there."" That's it. You'd think for $40 it would also include, say, an extra connecting cord or wall plug so you could charge the thing while it stands up. But no."
3,Good content for the intermediate-level user,"This is a useful book if you are already familiar with thelighting equipment that exists, in which case the contentis quite good (4 stars). But it's not the best book for youif you don't yet know what lighting equipment exists (2 stars)."
5,more than I expected,"Being fascinated by the cover and the excerpt, I purchased this book. When I got it I was a bit dissapointed with its volume - just 120 pages, it seemed more like a medium-sized magazine. The pics were great, and I thought ""uh, this is probably a book that shows nice photos and case studies without any kind of solid base information."" But it turned to be the opposite:the book establishes clear terminology for many conceptsit explains what pronciples apply to light dark and light objactsit is divided into 2 parts: dealing with diffuse and specular controlthe book is not about case studies mainly but about the principles of controlling light, shadows, specular with almost all availabe controls, including motion blur and dof in reflectionsit has many unique tips about different aspects that truly may be named ""creative lighting techniques""So far deserved 5 stars from me."
5,Very much impressed,"Many reviewers point out that this book is not suitable for a novice, not even for quite experienced photographers without studio background. When buying this book, I was an amateur ""natural-light photographer"". I had no idea about studio photography. I bought a couple of books, including this one, together with my first studio lighting set.This book was quite difficult to read, especially for a non-native speaker. However, after getting a bit used to the language, it was really a pleasure to read. I learned very much and with a certain effort understood everything quite well. Just started to read it the second time to memorize better. And just ordered ""Light: Science and Magic: An Introduction to Photographic Lighting"" which was recommended by one of the reviewers to compare..."
2,Making simple lighting overly complicated,"Good thing I got this book from my local library and didn't pay for it. The book is heavily worded and makes simple lighting setups that are easily learned in the classroom rather confusing. When you're lighting, you shouldn't be doing complicated math or referring to the inverse square law to realize your lighting is too close or two far or not modified correctly. (Not to mention I've caught a small handful of grammatical errors.)This book is good if you're a techie photog, but in my opinion, you're going to miss out on a heck of a lot of shots and really suck the fun out of photography and experimenting with lighting.To be fair, there are a lot of helpful lighting maps and some good basic advice for those who are completely new to lighting in this book. So.. if you don't have a clue.. don't start with this book or make it your bible, but definitely take a look and get the general idea."
2,Not what I expected,"Not quite what I expected.... There's too much blah blah and not so much actual lighting outlines. They did a good job in offering pictures along with camera/lights setup maps, but not enough. Too many words, not too much actual material to work with. Surely re-sell this book. Brand new."
2,It's not for the Faint of Heart,"This book may be great, that is if, you are into the technical jargons of photography. I would not suggest this book for a novice, amateur or even semi pro. This book gives me the feeling that the author knew what he was talking about but he just could not but it into Layman's term for you the grasp the idea behind lighting for different projects. I also thought it lacked a great amount of information and studio problem solving techniques."

4,A quality dvd,"+ a full concert, 25 promo videos and three documents+ great sound and picture quality+ well chosen songs and excellent musicians- not all promo videos are included (5-10 are missing)- the video menu is poorly built, videos can't be played in a sequence (only one at a time)"
5,Awesome!,That's the only word I can think of to describe this wonderful concert. I saw it twice and cannot wait to see the DVD and relive! The extra features offered by the DVD can only enhance the past year while Phil was touring. January 5th - here I come!
4,GREAT BUT NEEDS MORE,"First off, you should buy this DVD. There's no bigger Collins fan than I, so I may be a little more critical than the average fan. The drum solo to start the show is worth the price of the DVD alone- it will give you goose bumps. The show is great- sound quality, direction, and length. My only complaint is the lack of older Collins tunes. We've all heard the same songs live on other cd's and DVD's, so why not include some others like: I Don't Care Anymore, It Don't Matter To Me, Inside Out, Everyday, or something from the Face Value album besides In The Air Tonight? I'm tired of seeing/hearing the same 15 super-commercial songs on all the live albums/dvd's. Buy it."
3,Rarities?,"Black N' Blue is a band that fell through the cracks along the massively paved road of 80s hair bands. They really deserve to have a lot more album sales than they achieved. Unfortunately thats the nature of the music business. This is a great CD for any hardcore Black n Blue fan, or for somebody that doesn't have any Black n Blue recordings. The recordings on this CD are rare, but the songs are not. It includes many of their ""should have been"" hits."
5,Good Buy,I love the cover because the color is brilliant and bright. It brighten up the laundry room. Fits well with the beach theme I have. I'll definately purchase from this company again.
1,Crisp,"Beware, this album does not contain live Tv performances as the title implies but is a compilation of Liberty tracks available elsewhere and the track Stay should read Sway"
1,hero is no hero,"What really bothered me about this book was that the hero, after taking the heroine's virginity, just dumps her and marries someone else. Throughout the entire book he seems to only be using her and not really care about her at all. And his reason that he gives for dumping her without a word does not in anyway justify it or make me sympathetic toward his character. Apparantly, he felt that even though she was a virgin she was so uninhibited he felt she would turn into a slut and break his heart and that is why he just up and married someone else. The hero was a complete slime up until the very end, he never redeems himself."
1,why did I waste my time,"i can't really write a review without having to finished the book and man I'm pissed off after reading it. This book is written for women who likes abusive men. Which is not a romance and I felt disgusted with the heroine who doesn't seem to want better for herself. And our supposedly 'hero' is the biggest jerk and other names i've read about in a long while of romance novels. The author does nothing to make him likable or redeem him. Ugh, I'll be more careful to chose and read Jacqueline Baird books. Too bad the rating doesn't have negative value not worth your time."
1,Worst book ever,"I almost threw the book against the wall. The heroine have no backbone and i can't phantom how she can sleep with the hero when he treats her like a whore. There was moments while reading this book i just wanted to choke the hero and if i was the heroine i would have shot him in his black heart. I usually like Jaqueline Baird's book, but this book was not one of them. Baird should be ashamed of writing this book and i am glad i didn't pay for it."
4,Really not that bad,Yes what the others were saying is true with this book but really it wasn't that bad. Amber could have fought the so called blackmail more if she wanted after all she was supposedly so smart! Yet she didn't. It was like she was willing to go along with the whole thing and by him offering up the blackmail then perhaps she saved some of her pride. Besides he got his in the end when he married the one woman instead of Amber. For some reason he thought he could just convince himself that he loved her and that he really knew Amber. Yet he didn't did he? Would have been nice if she had put up more of a fight and made him work for it more but then this is a Harlequin and it doesn't appear that the women do that in these novels.
3,prints duplex but has several problems...,"have this printer for 6 months now. the best feature is duplex-printing, which works very well. as most reviewers have pointed out, the text/graphics outputs are not very sharp, but can be easily pardoned for the price. however, there are two other major problems. (1) limited color range. e.g., deep red gets printed as orange. (2) cannot print fine lines -- if you try to print line-art, then expect the lines to be thickened. if you have alternating black and white lines of equal width, the printout will show black over-powering white significantly. i am getting another hp 2600n, but will keep the 510n around for draft work and volume duplex printing."
1,CLP-510 is a big piece of junk,"I bought this printer from Costco yesterday, brought it home and set it up:- the size of this printer is comparable to heavy duty HP models: it is big and very heavy- software installation/uninstallation is done professionally: it creates a restore point and then removes all entries- driver is not good: text at the bottom of Win XP test page is cut-off- noise level is acceptable only in sleeping mode (same as from 4 fans inside my PC). When starting up it could wake up the entire house; printing is loud as well- print speed is slow: OkiData B4250 with 16MB is 3 times faster than this junk with 64MB- print quality: text is ok, graphics - not acceptable at all - this printer cannot print solid background, it comes out as shades. It also leaves white stripes where part of the image should go- it generates enough heat to warm up a room :-)This printer goes back to Costco in few minutes :-) I am getting another B4250 (monochrome) because color is not that important for me."
1,Defective Product,"A comment from one of the readers indicated that there is ""bad burning smell almost like plastic"".I purchased from Staples and have the same problem and plan to return it. Suspected reason: The roller at the top does not stop rotating when the printer goes into SLEEP mode. The top area appears to be very hot as well. I am sure it is going to catch fire on a warm sunny day.--Follow up Comment- Samsung promptly replaced the defect roller -- and it is working very well for me. I can give it a 4 star now."
1,Worst purchase ever made,"I bought this printer to print color documents made in Word, Excel, and Publisher, or PDFs. When I couldn't print any color documents, I called Samsung's tech support. Following tech support's directions, I could print only a Word file in black and white. After unsuccessful attempts to print color documents, tech support said the color printer lacks ""postscript drivers"" that is needed to print color documents made in Word, Excel, Publisher, or PDFs. Something is missing here? I don't know how others are able to print color documents, but I returned it since the color printer wasn't able to print color."
4,Color Laser Printer,"Delivered in a timely manner. Well-packaged. Easy set up instructions. Pretty decent quality, at least compared to my previous non-laser printer. All the compartments are within easy access. The size was just right for my desktop; neither to large a machine, nor too small. I like the product & was happy with the company who sent it. Overall I would say this is a very good printer for the price."
1,"Stay away, you get what you pay for!","Ever since buying this printer I've only had it operational about half of the time within the first six months. I've spend about $50 on parts it told me I needed only to find out it was a bad sensor. Eventually Samsung send a tech out to fix it. Even that was about a month after they said it would be. Thankfully, I kept my old inkjet as a backup.I will not but any Samsung products in the future.Keith"
4,a little fuzzy,"Despite the high resolution numbers claimed this machine is a bit fuzzier for B&W; printing than my 7-year-old HP laserprinter. On the plus side, the printer was easy to set up for Windows XP printing through a network-attached storage disk array. The pages are smear-proof unlike those from an inkjet printer. I don't think that there is any other printer at this price that will duplex (print on both sides).Make sure that you have a friend named Bruno when it is time to hoist this puppy into the car or onto a desk."
1,Unhappy customer.,"After I receipt the printer, set up and turn on. I bought the defective repubish unit. I didn't want to sent 80 pound to post office and spent extra $90 on it for repair. what can i do? I learn that I will never buy on line again unless seller shall paid fee for their poor quality."
1,A scam masquerading as a printer,"We all know how printers are sold to sell ink, right? Well this one takes that model to the limit and beyond.Each supply part (toner, waste bottle, etc.) has a microchip. Each microchip decides when the part has reached its end of life. The chip's decision is final - the printer refuses to print once any chip has pulled the plug on any part.You may think that you have plenty of toner to complete the job at hand - pages aren't faded in the least. The chip decides otherwise and the printer refuses to finish the job. Nothing you can do but throw away half a cartridge worth of toner and buy a new one - no reset, no help from tech support, nothing.Adding insult to injury, most office supply houses don't stock the cartridges in store so in addition to getting ripped off, you'll wait a day or two before your printer cedes control back to you - the stupid human.Avoid this printer (and probably this manufacturer) like the plague."
3,Rating Samsung CLP-510,This is our main office color copy and overall it does an adequate job. Printer was easy to install and setup. Color is good. Paper needs to be fanned carefully to avoid paper jams and even then we still have some. Paper tray cannot be fully loaded or it jams easily. We have adjusted how we use this printer and it is functioning fine.
3,NO PHOTO PAPER ACCEPTED,"Argghhh, thought I could get rid of my inkjet. Wrong. CLP 510 will not print on glossy photo paper. First, I was going to call the repairman, but then wandered to the Samsung site and in horribly poor translated English was informed that this particular printer will only print on regular paper. But what the hey. Awsome for everyday use with wonderful colors and good enough for hubby's MBA epitomes."
3,Don't buy things from this supplier,"The printer was supposed to be refurbished, and it just didn't work. I had to write 4 emails and wait about a month before I got a response and my money back."
1,Part failed (seal was bad) upon installation.,What more can I say? Seal was bad before I even installed the part. Had to use the other one as a back up. Bleeder screw strips easily (made of plastic). Sucks.
4,Nice looking mixer.,Hey. My wife loves it. I have no idea what the performance is like. The mixer one level up went on sale the next week (refurb.) for about $135. Wished I bought that instead of this one new. Oh well.
2,CONCERNED.,"Good Sres.KitchenAid KSM150PSMC Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer, Metallic Chrome. I write at this time because he had found the chance to do before. I am really worried because in December to buy the product and after a long wait, nearly three months came to me in very bad condition. I think the mistake was yours because the blender came into my hands in the same box that was shipped from the tiemda, with labels, I mean not taking the necessary measures for the order arrived in good condition .. I have bought many times from amazon travez and first time I get a packet in these conditions, it is always double box and sent shock absorbers, whether animate or inflatable that leave no damage. The mixer was beaten, scratched and broken. Escuentran utensils is also bent and truth is very uncomfortable for me because it is a purchase that looked eager. You pay a lot of money both in the blender as shipping. Thank you can help me. Thanks."
3,tangerine in pic isn't exact,The Tangerine color in the on-line photo is more yellow than what we received. We found it to be a green-like tangerine.
5,"Love, love, love it!","I have wanted one of these KitchenAid mixers for a long time and finally decided I was going to splurge and buy it. I am so happy I did!! It's a wonderful mixer, so easy to use and does a great job. I did have to adjust the beater so it reached all the way to the bottom of the bowl, but it's a minor adjustment and easy to figure out from the owner's manual.The bowl locks easily into place. It has a nice large handle, too. I find the pouring shield to be a bit of a nuisance so I don't really use it, but the very low setting for mixing keeps flour and stuff from flying out of the bowl anyway, even without using the shield.Great mixer, I'd recommend it to anyone."
5,Quality Product,This item is perfect whether you are using commercially or just at home. All the add-ons are a plus and additional ones can be purchased. It is very durable and I definitely don't foresee any problems with this product.
5,Great Machine,"Love my kitchen aid! Just got voted best mixer by America's Test Kitchen agian!!! I actually have the 6Qt model and bought this one for my dad who is a retired chef! He loves it! Makes bread in it every weekend! Says it saves his hands!! My model handles a triple batch of c.chip cookies with no problem! Sometimes 4 batches when my kids have sleepovers!!! I also like the meat grinder attachment! I grind my own meat with no worries about whats in it unlike that mystery meat you get at the market! Easy clean up also, just throw everything in the dishwasher(except for the mixing blades, mine are not the plastic ones and when they are washed in the dishwasher spots form so I wash them by hand. Not sure if they still sell the stainless blades)Hope this helps!"
5,"Fabulous item, daughter loves it!!","Bought this for my daughter to take to college and she has been the popular baker ever since! Great item for a great price, great seller!"
5,Perfect gift for Mom,"I got this product for my mom for her birthday and she LOVES it. She and I made cookies together over Christmas break, and it was very easy to use. The controls are simple, it's easy to clean, and it mixes better and faster than any other product on the market. I purchased the ice cream maker attachment for my mom for Christmas and the ice cream it made was amazing.The only down-side to this product is its weight. I'm a healthy 24 year old and I had trouble lifting it to move it around. You really need to make a space for it on your counter-top and leave it in one place unless you have a lot of arm muscle."
1,the nut fell off,"I bought one 2 weeks ago, only used it couple times, then yesterday, I tried to make a simple bread, the nut to hold the head and the base together just fell off, and the head kept shaking, and made a hell of scary noise, I called the kitchenaid, and they said they will send a new one, but this is just frustrating!"
3,Thumb up for KitchenAid Thumb down for Amazon...,"I am happy with the Kitchenaid mixer, but a bit disappointed with Amazon. The mixer came in the Kitchenaid box with a delivery label slapped on it rather than carefully packed in another box with extra protection. The condition of the box was concerning as the sides were dented badly. Good thing that Kitchenaid packed it so well. It was a gift, so I was embarrassed in its presentation/appearance. I was a bit disappointed that there were some paint imperfections on the unit, although nothing that effects function.Unit works great and it is a quality machine! I don't know if I will ever order something of substance from Amazon again as a result of their poor shipping and unit condition."
5,Terrific service,I love shopping on Amazon. I ordered this KitchenAid mixer for a wedding gift and it was delivered promptly as promised. No hastles or problems.thank you
5,Love it!,"I love my KitchenAid Stand Mixer. I am able to leave it on the counter (it's quite heavy), and I use it often. Most of the time, I only need the bowl and the paddle. Quick clean-up. Beautiful color.I originally bought another less expensive mixer because I just couldn't justify the price. We took it out of the box and instantly knew it was of poor quality. Took it back and ordered the KitchenAid."
4,impressed,"I have only had this machine for a month, but it has done everything I hoped off. I've baked bread and other goodies without any problem.It is very convenient to use and easy to clean.My only complaint is that Amazon plays with the price too much and I settled for the chrome color when I really wanted red, which was $100 more expensive when I ordered mine. Two weeks later the red stand mixer's price had dropped to the price of the chrome one. Still, chrome or red, this machine was an excellent purchase."
5,Great kitchen tool,This machine is simply awesome - very high tech and all the bells and whistles one could possibly ask for. All the positive reviews are more than justified.
4,Like it but came with a scratch on it,I really like the product however it did come with a good sized scratch on the back of it & it was to heavy to think about shipping back so I kept it. Preforms very well though.
5,The Champagne of Mixers,"Unlimited power, unlimited speed choices, and this thing does it all. Is quite heavy, so remans stable on the counter during any type of job . . . no need to wrestle with it to keep it steady. It's not really portable, so you'll need a designated counter top spot. Likely to be the last mixer you'll ever want to buy.My wife insisted on blue (which we bought and looks very nice), but I would say go with the chrome/metallic. Styles change but this will always be a safe choice and displays and wipes off beautifully."
5,very satisvied; BUT!,"The mixer works great, my pizza dough comes out perfect, but I haven't received my free attachment ( shreader-chopper) KItcenAid promised with the purchase of the product."
5,Wife was extremely pleased,I bought this mixer as a present for my wife. It is extremely sturdy and heavy and powerered right through a batch of peanut butter cookie dough without missing a beat. A huge leap from the hand mixer.
5,I looked at this item on several sites. As usual Amazon had the best price.,"This does everything I wanted and more. I you want something that will handle 97% of all needs, this is it."
5,Mi comentario,"Excelente articulo que cumple todas las expectativas por la cual lo adquiri, es una pieza fundamental en mi cocina y me fue entregado sin ningun contratiempo."
5,Beautifully crafted mixer.,"I bought this as a gift. This machine is like piece of art and I love that I purchased it when the price dipped to the lowest I've seen on Amazon or anywhere else! Solid, solid, solid construction. Nothing better than to have the right tools at your disposal."
5,as good as it seems,it is awsome this powerfull mixer is funtional and improves the way of cooking in my kitchen it cant be anything much better than it
5,I love this mixer!,This mixer will be a blessing for anyone who loves to bake and appreciates high quality appliances. It mixes ingredients quickly and completely. The bowl is deep and the guard helps prevent splatter. It is very heavy though so you will not want to have to pull it out of a cabinet every time you use it. Plus it is much too attractive to hide!
4,Kitchenaid artasian mixer,"[...]I qualify my review with four stars because the product is new and so far has had little use. The mixer is very solid, appears to be of quality construction, the instructions are clear and the mixer is easy to use. It did arrive in a slightly damaged box that included a minor scratch on the top of the mixer. The product is quit heavy and possibly should have been shipped in a more substantial container. Bottom line, my wife loves it."
1,Disappointed,"The seller (other than Amazon)advertised this product as ""like new"", but upon arrival it turned out to be a warped vinyl record with a few skips and scratches. It was not as advertised.Sincerely,Xavier Urbina"
1,awful,"The worst Gherman on record is definitely Atlantov.His comrad Milashkina, is as uninvolved and thoughtless as could be. These hyped-up ""stars"" of Bolshoi don't have the artistry or the sensitivity for Tchaikovsky's ravishing score.The recording quality is poor.Vasiliy Nikolaevich Nikitskiy"
5,megaman rocks,If you've played Megaman Battle Network 1 then you know about the WWW and their evil plots. Now Megaman has 2 new styles. Shadow and ground. The shadow lets you use ninja tactics. The ground lets you crack the ground with a power shot hit it also lets you destroy rocks in one power shot.Nobody can save the net like Megaman can.
5,megaman battle netwrok 4 is kickin!,mmbn4b is awesome! it takes the old enemys of megaman adnd makes them better by adding a techno look to them and now to custimize megaman you must you the customization tools and arrange programs on the program map!and also there are the style changed from the previous games.and megaman blue is the only game thta can get the shadow style whil white gets the bug style.
3,Good i guess...,"This game is REALLY fun, but after a while, it gets boring.A good storyline and tons of battle chips make it a huge improvement from the last one, and the graphics aren't bad, but they need to do something to make it a little more exciteing.It's bassicly the same as the last one with a little improvements, but if you're a Megaman fan,this is a good game for you."
2,One major glitch...,If you have a key item and you save while you have it the item will still be there but the ebent that the item goes with isn't there so the item then can't be used i don't know if it's only the part with Flashman or all the key item parts.
1,megaman 3 review,"I ussualy love megaman games no matter what, but the game won't let me save AT ALL!!!Iwill NEVER recomend this game to ANYONE!! do not by Megaman battle network blue version!"
4,Really cool,"Awsome game, tons of new battle chips, and lots of new enemies. A really big upgrade of graphics compared to the last one!"
3,Light at the end of the tunnel,"Story of determination and a strong will,knowing she can conquer whatever obtacles that get in her way."
5,Don't miss this one!,"This book has it all. Great characters, a fine story, Alaska and the Native Peoples play a large part. The heroes include a man, woman, child and a dog.There is plenty of tension and I read the book in one gulp. I highly recommend this book and will be reading the second book in the series as soon as I can get my hands on it.Jeri"
3,one more tribute,"If you're a hardcore M.O. fan (and a sucker like me), you've bought every tribute band, album, and inmitator that's come down the pike over the last 20+ years. But let's face it, they've all disappointed. No one's matched the in-your-face power and virtuosity of the original M.O. No exception here, although I'd put this tribute towards the top of the heap. The tunes have been arranged to suit the individual guitarists style...and there's some kick-ass good music here, no question. Just don't expect your mind to get blown like it's 1973 and any fusion fan should enjoy this."
2,Mahavishnu Orchestra is a Tough Act to Cover,"As a Maha fanatic I really wanted to love this CD, but outside of John Abercrombie's take on Follow our Heart, nothing takes flight. Problematic are the arrangements that pay little respect to the original compositions and a rhythm section that plods along with none of the forward leaning urgency and intensity of the original Mahavishnu Orchestra. As far as tributes go, The Mahavishnu Project does a much better job of honoring both the spirit and the musical innovations of the Mahavishnu Orchestra."
1,"Thin, rough and cheap feeling. Will be returning these.","I've used silk pillowcases for years and swear by them for protecting your hair and not creating facial creases. I couldn't remember shich one I last ordered (a few years ago), these looked nice online. Arrived yesterday and they're awful. The silk is super thin, almost see-through, the texture is rough, negating their value for hair and skin. The entire product feels cheap and kind of...dreary. I ordered these as holiday presents, but will have to find someting else. For a m ore luxurious feel, I will search for a pillowcase labeled ""silk charmeuse"" or similar."
2,Not what I expected,The fabric is very thin and has an almost papery feel to me. It seems larger than a standard pillowcase side.
2,fabric too thin,"I was looking for something to help with ""bed head"" - didn't work for me (fabric is very thin). Not wild about the attached pocket on the pillowcase, either (I wasn't planning on traveling with the pillowcase)"
2,Don't buy it unless you have a HUGE pillow,"nice to the touch but ""travels"" all around my standard pillow, slides off at night, very annoying. would not reccommend it"
4,silk pillowcase,"I purchased this for my sister who has just started chemo. She loves it, says that it has kept her hair from falling out at a faster rate (no drag)."
1,Never received product... :(,"I wish I could review the actual product, but never received it... Was contacted in a very reasonable time by the merchant to inform me that the color I chose was not in stock. I chose another, they were...fairly... polite, and I expected to see it in the next week or so. Not even close. I placed the order on October 11...today is the 28th... I got the automated message from amazon saying that the item hadn't been confirmed for shipment as of last week. (A good week after speaking with the company) It said to contact the merchant directly, just reply to the message. I did. No response. No item. No charge on my credit card either, so that's good. Definitely won't order from this vendor again... Very disappointed."
5,"yes, it's silk","what can you expect from pillowcase? yes, it's silk, you can call this color 'honey' and it fits. Owsom!"
5,love the perfume but the packing could have been better,I am surprised that I got the item intact. The retailer needs to do a better job of packing for shipping. I love the perfume and wish it wasn't so hard to find.
4,a delightful floral fragrance,"German born Heidemarie Jiline Sander is now an internationally acclaimed fashion designer known, for simplicity's sake, as Jil Sander. Simplicity may be the operative word here as she is known for the uncluttered lines of her designs for women and men. She later presented purses and other fashion accessories.Could a perfume be far behind? Not very. Her signature fragrance is also pure, refined, a rich floral oriental scent. Favored by many luminaries as the late fashion icon, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the fragrance contains rose, peach, jasmine, carnation, musk and vanilla.Suitable for both day and evening, this long lasting scent is also available in a lotion and bath gel."
5,A Reminder how fun service can be,Oh to get the chance of a life time as these two ladies had. The descriptions in this book were so crisp and clear. I could really imagine how it would be to sleep on the roof and just be like a kid again. This book had a powerful message of forgiveness and how to live through the hard times. I love that the author took time to give each character so much flavor and allow you to really know them. I felt that the book showed the extreme pluses to serving others in our journey and how important it is to pass on the friendship to starving women down the road and help others remember how to enjoy life where they are.
4,beautiful voice,"I first heard Mike in concert with Jim Brickman. I agree with the previous reviewer that his voice is beautiful, but I didn't care for all the songs on ME.However, he is supposed to have a new CD out in September with his single ""Hear Me,"" which is phenomenal! Does anyone have any idea on a suggested release date? Couldn't get anymore info from his website other than September.Thanks"
2,"Many characters vanish, followed shortly by the plot.........","This movie starts with an interesting premise which is immediately engaging. Unfortunately, very little happens over the next hour to draw you in. The plot and character development stall quite quickly, and the film drags. I kept watching nonetheless, expecting a big pay-off at the end, which, sadly, never came. The movie ends abruptly with a range of Christian imagery and all major questions unanswered. Frustrating all around."
4,"Nice, tight little film","Despite the reviews this is a GOOD movie. It's not a blockbuster and it isn't flashy, splashy teen entertainment, but it IS good. The premise is thought provoking. Why do we exist? Do we do it for ourselves or others? Why is it important to keep on going when there is no hope and no future? Is it simply enough to say ""I am""? I think that this film does a fine job of highlighting our place and confusion in the world we face every day. Is there a God? Is it all just science? There are hints and explanations that seem to justify either or even justify both at the same time. However, the truth is that we just don't know. We can't know until the shadow catches up with us...and that's what we fear. The end of ourselves4 star rating for me. I'd give it 5 but it's a little too smart for it's own good. Glad I caught it!"
3,nice sci fi movie,"i didnt think this movie was as bad as some as the reviews.........i thought it was a solid nice sci fi movie......the idea was eerie & maybe it was some kind of a re boot of society idea type of movie......i did find it odd the animals were able to survive the dark shadows....hmmm maybe cuz the animals are pure & didnt need re-booting & unlike humans who have been so jaded & corrupted etc they needed a fresh start.............maybe thats why the ending was the way it was.........the people left were the ""purest"" choice.......my only complaint was it was so dark for most of the watch but i still enjoyed it................"
3,An unusual thriller,"I caught this on HDNet about the same time it was released in a limited number of theaters. I fear it won't have much of an audience. ""Vanishing"" is yet another take on Armageddon with more than a strong hint of religious overtones. It is also fraught with questions, none of which are answered. This leads to frustration. I suspect the filmmakers would say something like, ""it's up to the viewer to decide"". Baloney! We want facts. We want answers...at least for the key elements. Obviously cost was a factor as the evil-doers are essentially shadows that take the human form, but leave their clothes. Light, real or artificial, can save you. Still, in the city of Detroit, only 4 or 5 people have survived, but who knows. In spite of more questions than answers, the movie has its share of tension and spookiness. It's not really a horror movie though. I think it would be more at home as a 45 minute episode of ""The Twilight Zone""."
2,After readingthe reviews and seeing commercial on TV:,"I've decided not to see the film (it looked interesting at first as if it would make for a good horror movie) but because of the reference to The Left Behind Series of books which is crack christian jargon because the authors of those books catering to the Christian crowd and we know what Jesus supposedly said to his deciples:""All the people that teach in the synagogues (churches) and on the streets are hypocrites"". - A hypocrite by definition is someone that is stupid and not knowing, i.e. an idiot.Director Werner Herzog made a documantary called ""Cave of Forgotten Dreams"" where he discovered a cave that had drawings inside it that were an estimated 35,000 years old which negates the 2000 year old story of Christ by 33,000 years or more."
1,Boring,I never shut a movie off early or skip scenes but I did skip a few chapters in this one. The movie started out pretty good but then it got so slow and I couldnt wait for it to be over.
4,Vanishing on 7th Street (+ Digital Copy),"This movie was a bit strange, but a very good horror story starring my favorite actor - Hayden Christensen. I highly recommend this movie for horror fans; and Hayden's fans as well."
1,Turned off after 30 minutes,"I love theses types of movies, but this one was so lame, boring. Turned it off after 30 minutes. Theatrical release yeah right it will be on screen for a week."
1,Zero stars,"This movie is just a complete waste. This must be on Amazon as a pre-theatre release because the investors know just how bad it really is and have to somehow reclaim some of their investment. The concept is great, but the movie is essentially OVER after the first 20 minutes. I say it's over after the first 20 minutes because after the ""event"" occurs, this story falls flat. There is absolutely NO character development. I didn't find myself caring about any of the characters because I didn't know anything about them. I think a 10 year old would be able to develop better characters and a plot with more depth than this. Seriously, this is a complete waste of money. Wait for it to come out for free on Netflix instant watch and you'll thank me for saving you the $$$."
1,OMG!!!,I am a fan of Thandie Newton and Hayden but this movie sucked. It should had been for $2.99 and i am glad that me and a friend of mine didn't pay more to watch this at the movies. Thanks amazon for the heads up.
2,DONT BOTHER IS REAL SLOW & AWFUL !~!!!,"I SAW this lame movie in pre-screen in HD-MOVIESBah, where to begin? The film starts off strong with a good scary set up, but the story of mass disappearances of people when they are in darkness goes nowhere. We waited all 90 minutes for some explanation; even some guesses by the remaining few who have found one another, but none came. The characters are completely uninspired and even when they learn that they will die if it goes dark, they dont take even the most basic steps to survive (candles? gas lamps?). Frustrating, as this could have been an interesting movie, even scary, but its as if the writer & director had an idea for a piece of a movie, but never developed the plot. Its ninety minutes of whispers I exist and dark shadow creeping up on people to take them away and pretty much nothing else. i recommend as just STUPID & WASTED MY TIME!!!!! D"
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Vanishing On 7th Street had a lot of possibilities, but it was done so narrow-mindedly, that the film just becomes a complete waste of time. First, we are rushed into the heart of the story, without any background or character development. Then, within twenty minutes, we're thrown ahead three days, leaving us with many questions that are never answered. Finally, after an hour of typical frantic people stuck in an impossible situation, we get an ending that just doesn't fit. I was attracted to this film by its clever title and by Hayden Christensen, who I believe to be a very underrated actor, but I was highly disappointed. Vanishing On 7th Street is rushed, sloppy, predictable, and full of plot holes. To me this seemed more like a rough draft than a full length feature film, it really just wasn't very good."
2,What??,"Couldn't figure out what was causing the ""Vanishings"" Oh well, it was ok background noise while working. It didn't grab me enough to want to watch it again to try and figure it out."
3,The Night the Gene Pool Went out in Detroit,"I had a great time poking fun at the 4 pitiful characters in the movie: on one hand they are full of self pity and just can't let go of their dead loved ones, and on the other hand, they suffer from a fatal lack of brain power and unity. They could have easily survived the night by working together to build a fire. Instead, 5 min doesn't run by that someone didn't have an emotional breakdown or running off to look for a relative who obviously have evaporated. Oh well; the world's gene pool won't suffer much without these blokes around! Thank goodness for Darwinism!"
4,I enjoyed it,"I am not sure why most of the reviews are negative, the story is compelling, acting was good, and overall I enjoyed the creepy aspect of the film."
2,Another poor outing for Hayden Christiansen,"This movie is take of the Roanoke Colony disappearance from American colonial history. Meant to be a horror movie, I did not find this movie scary in the least bit. In fact, the essence of the story; i.e. shadows stealing people away, is quite ridiculous. Add to that is a lot of bad acting from all the adult actors and actresses and we have a movie that flopped at both the theaters and on DVD. Stay away viewers."
3,Died an unnatural death,"Comment: Yea... ""spoiler alert"", I really hate movies that do a fairly good job of getting you hooked and setting up a supernatural possibility... then turns around and just leaves you hanging after you have invested all your time staying with the movie to the end. Techies will get hooked on this movie because of new science theories about a ""substance"" called ""dark matter"". If you know nothing about dark matter do an internet search on the subject and be drawn in to this fairly new theory. In any case... my critique on this movie is that it never fulfilled it's potential... it spent too much time on the characters and not near enough completing the what, how and why of the phenomena. This movie could have been far better than it (disappointingly) turned out to be."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"What happens when everyone in town disappears into the shadows? Nothing good as the denziens of Vanishing on 7th Street soon learn; a horror/thriller from Brad Anderson (The Machinist, Session 9) in which a group of survivors in downtown Detroit (Hayden Christensen, Thandie Newton, and John Leguizamo) find themselves trying to stay in the light as people all over are disappearing into the darkness and shadows. While the film offers a good dose of chills and Anderson's flair for psychological horror, the end result just feels sadly empty. Considering the previously mentioned films that Anderson has helmed were quite masterful, Vanishing on 7th Street just doesn't have that same kind of magic going for it. Still, it's worth a look at least, just don't expect the same kind of horiffic magic to occur that Anderson managed to weave in his previous works."
1,Don't rent this horrible movie,"This movie had plenty of promise in the ""idea"" and that is about it.Don't waste your money!! If you decide to watch it, go to netflix and watch it streaming.. this way you can save your money.. Just a BIG disappointment"
1,...zzzzzzzzz...,"...I can't believe I fell for the $10.99 pre-release gambit. A waste of money... my bad. I'll be surprised if this does indeed make it to theaters. This movie was a complete bore... with mild, long padded acting scenes, very little 'suspense', and iffy special effects: moving shadows. Wow! :-( The religious overtones and lack of explenation toward the 'non-ending' left me, well, a bit angry. It's difficult for me to even go into 'review' detail, as there was so much non-event during long stetches of this film. I suggest you wait until it's availabe for 'free' on Netflix if you are curious... that'll save you money, and time - if you decide to cut it off and fall asleep."
1,Vanishing on 7th Street: What the hell did I just watch?,"No, but seriously, what the hell did I just freakin watch? And why Anakin never used the force or his lightsaber against these things is beyond me!!!I gave it one star because after all, you do get a free case for a dvd and inside that is a really cool and nifty little coaster .....OH and it makes the most awesome looking UFO if you throw it out your car window, over the Tappan Zee Bridge on a sunny day wit the rays of the sun hittin it and all. And people will be like, ""oh wow, look it's a UFO and it's headin straight for the water, oh no!!"" and you'll be like ""ha, no it's not, it's just a dvd........ah, you know what..I would just avoid this movie altogether is what I'm saying....Peter Griffin"
2,Sucks!!,"Now i can see why this movie never made it to every theatre in America, it sucks! It gives no reason to why ""shadows"" are taking peoples bodies, or why only certain lights keep them at bay. Really dumb flick."
3,"the movie itself... ""vanished.""","To sit through all of that... for THAT!??!Interesting enough, and well-executed enough, to keep one going on and on and on (like the energizer Bunny) -- but to what ""endless end,"" is beyond me? No resolution, no explanations. Just a slice of mystery that tapers as mysteriously as it began.Please, I should have cleaned out the oven, instead."
1,I want my $10 back.,"Seriously, there should be refunds for films this terrible. This film took amazing concepts (mysterious mass disappearance and shadow people) and turned them into a worthless piece of crap. How do you screw up a film about SHADOW PEOPLE? Seriously. How? From Session 9 to this?"
2,Please read before deciding to rent,Please do not watch this movie unless you are a fan of these actors. It is definitely not worth the money. You will be upset in the end. Just wait until later to watch it.
1,Ambiguity and just not knowing how to write are different,"Semi Spoiler. Actually since there was nothing to spoil saying that the ending was a non ending can just save you time. While this film was interesting enough to keep me at the 2-3 star level throughout it needed a home run ending to make it worthwhile. Don't waste your time. There was nothing there. And if you are expecting to have your mind blown don't hold your breath. While I love films that are ambiguous and leave open a myriad of interpretations this film does not do that. It was not particularly scary and the SFX were not done very well. The characters were not all that interesting either. This could have been a made for TV film and I am actually reminded of old, more compact and well done, Twilight Zone TV. Grabbing season one of The Twilight Zone will make you much happier and give you more bang for your buck."
2,tried to like it but just couldnt,"Im a big horror/thriller buff and not just the blood and gore but the trully scary, whats around the corner stuff. Was I dissapointed, YES! I did my very best to give it a serious chance but midway through what started as promising continued to slide downhill. It had a couple early moments that looked promising but it really quits midway through the movie and goes very stale and predictable. It fizzles at the end and I know the director would probably say he wanted to be thought provoking and let the watcher decide for themselves what it all meant. At least thats my guess as it means zilch. Sorry people but even the most ernest of bump in the night fans will more than likely find themselves frustrated and confused...Good Luck...PS 2 stars cuz of a couple early on scenes which had some creepy value"
1,Terrible,Such a wasted cast. Hayden and Thandie are both wonderful actors. I have no idea how they got wrapped up in such a terrible movie. It took some great concepts and mashed them together and turned it into crap.
1,item arrived way too late and broken,"item arrived way too late and broken. did not make for a good birthday, as daddy is a firemen and this was important."
5,Big Hit,My grandson received this for his second birthday and immediately put it on - backwards. Too cute!! The adjustable size inside is great for dad too.
3,fun but cheap,"My three-year-old son loves his new fire hat, but the brim cracked about a week after he got it. My husband has glued it, but it came apart again."
3,fireman's hat,"Received this quickly, and intact. The product was as indicated, but is rather delicate. Not sure how long it will last on the head of a 3 year old."
4,Fireman hat,The hat will make my grandson very happy this Christmas! He loves fire trucks and will be thrilled to pieces
3,Very small hat,I have access to pediatric growth charts and this hat is too small for the 50%tile head circumference for 3 year olds. I recommend you find a different hat.
1,Not As Described,"The fireman hat we got was not like the one in the picture. It's very poor quality. The sticker in the front is not as attractive as the one in the picture. It's a small round sticker that says ""fire chief"" on it that is extremely cheap looking. Actually the sticker has been halfway unstuck from the hat from the day we got it. Even the plastic is flimsy. Maybe a nice hat shipped with this at one point in time but the hat that is being shipped now is not the same hat and it isn't worth buying."
3,they break too easily,"My preschool class was excited by the hats when they arrived. Unfortunately, the brim of one broke the first day. A second brim broke a few days later. I have other toy fire hats that look the same but are a few years old without any cracks. These hats really don't hold up."
5,good quality hat,"I purchased this hat for my 3-year-old's Halloween costume. I really liked that the hat was adjustable, so it actually stayed on my son's head while trick-or-treating. It is made from durable plastic to last, and I thought the price was very reasonable."
1,Broke within 5 minutes of opening on Christmas,"This is junk. My 5 year old, who is NOT hard on toys, broke this almost immediately. Fortunately we distracted her with other toys and threw this in the recycle bin. No salvaging this. The broken edge was sharp. What a disappointment.Buy something else and ignore the other reviews."
2,"Love the hat, but poorly made (and breaks easily)","I bought two of these hats for my twin boys and they love them. However, the rims of the hats have both broken by simply falling on the floor, as the plastic is not strong enough. The boys are wearing the hats now all taped up, but they won't last much longer. I will try to find higher quality hats, as my boys love wearing fireman hats."
3,Needs AUTOAIM,"The game is short, but sweet. Its nice and scary but the whole inside-outside aiming system is totally stupid. Lemme get this straight...You walk and move in third person....but have to fight in first?? What kind of crap is that? If it had auto aim, and/or you could move and shoot at the same time it would be one thing, but the way this is set up makes it a brutal way to play a game..."
3,Resident Evil: Dead Aim,"When I first picked up this game, I wasn't expecting it to be very good. I have played all the Resident Evil games, and the only first-person shooter, Survivor, was horrible. As I got into this game, however, I found myself enjoying it immensely. Having it in third-person until you enter combat is great. Also, the graphics are fairly good.I have only two complaints. First, when the cut scenes come up, the music volume is too loud and I had a hard time hearing the characters' voices. And I couldn't find out how to turn the music volume down on the game. Second, it was way too easy. There were no puzzles, as in most RE games, and the bosses were nothing special. I beat the game in only seven hours.All in all, I recommend that anyone interested rent this game, but I can't encourage anyone, even the die-hard Resident Evil fans, to buy it. The game just isn't long or hard enough to spend thirty-something dollars on."
2,Boring!!!!!!!,"I bought this game because I am a HUGE fan of Resident Evil-I was disappointed however because it was so easy I beat this game on the hard setting in less than an hour-if you want my advice, buy one of the other RE games, but as for this one, leave it on the store shelf-it is not worth the 40.00 it costs."
4,Dead in the water with the Guncon 2 and an HDTV.,"A Resident Evil lightgun game without being on a track. An excellent and unique concept I've been waiting years for. Unfortunately, if you use the Guncon 2 lightgun controller with an HDTV, it will NOT work. Otherwise it's a great game that beats the newer Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii hands down. Just remember, if you have Hi-def, you'll have to use the dualshock controller, which kills most of the fun."
4,Resident Evil Dead Aim Best One Yet !,This is the best Resident evil game yet.But you need the ps2 guncon 2 for the full afect of this game.you are on a ship the t virus was stolen and the ship was hijacked buy the the people who stole the virus and you have to get it back. This game is very violent and has a lot of blood and gore so becareful if you are buying it for a young son or daughter.As you can tell this game sells fast so dont wate to buy it.
2,Capcom is really getting on my nerves,"Dear Capcom, you are really getting on my nerves. I am really upset with you about RE Dead aim and RE Outbreak. I think you are just getting lazy. I loved resident evil 2, 3, and code veronica, but the latest RE releases have been greatly disapointing. This game has too many problems (ie: length, blandness). Don't buy it, rent it first and then decide. I am not buying any more games produced by Capcom until they realease Resident Evil 4 for the Playstation2 as well as the Gamecube. For those of you who don't know, Capcom has announced that it will only be realeasing RE 4 for the GameCube and not the PS2 because of a contact they have with Nintendo. It is just plain wrong. I'm not buying a gamecube just for one game."
2,THE MOST BORING RESIDENT I EVER BOUGHT,"IM A FAN OF RESIDENT EVIL GAMES , I LOVE TO PLAY ALL THE GAMES , SPECIALLY CODE VERONICA X , I SPENT SOME TIME ON IT BUT I DEFINITLY BEAT IIT , THEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS NEW RESIDENT EVIL DEAD AIM AND I THOUGHT : "" I HAVE TO BUY IT"" , WHEN I FIRST BEGAN TO PLAY THE GAME I NOTICED THAT IT WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER , I SPENT A VERY VERY SHORT TIME TO BEAT IT , THE STORY IS SO BAD , THE MONSTERS IN THE GAME , THEY CAN ATTACK YOU BUT YOU WOULDNT RECIEVE MUCH DAMAGE ,THE GRAPHICS ARE GOOD BUT I THINK THAT THIS GAME IS SO EASY TO BEAT , I TELL YOU NOT TO BUY THIS HORRIBLE GAME , IT MAKES ME FEEL VERY DISSAPOINTED ABOUT RESIDENT GAMES .WELL I GOTTA GO , ADIOS..."
1,i hate this game,"this is a terrible game. with the light gun, it is hard to control the person. the graphics are good but it is hadr to see. i spent 85 persent of the time just trying to look for something to shoot. dont get this game"
3,Resident Evil Dead Aim Or Dead Drag,This game was way to short for the money I paid for it. I expected it to be tough and interesting just like all the others. The graphics were cool but I beat this game in about 4 hours. Resident Evil Code Veronica was alot better game it took me about a month to beat.
5,Resident Evil Dead AIm,"Not the greatest resident evil game, but for the right price well worth trying out. If your not into new characters or the first person shooting then skip this one."
2,Short and Simple,"Compared to Survivor, this game is way better, but it doesnt belong with the ranks of 1,2,3,veronica, and zero. I rented this game and beat it the smae day i rented it. Its simple as hell and the one liners the main character uses r terrible. I recommend people to not buy this game. Just rent it and beat it then, it only takes bout 2 hours to beat. Paying 40 bucks for a game like this is a big waste of money."
2,The Great Let Down,"I bought this game after one fatal mistake, I didn't read any reviews. If you spend the amount of time on video games as I do, the replay factor of a game has to be good, with dead aim it just isn't.The graphics, armory, story line are all top notch. However, the fact that I beat this game in two days, on normal difficulty, ruins it all. The bosses need to be a little more difficult or simply more of them. Now that I have beat it I can't bring myself to sit down and waste any more time on such a short game.My suggestion for improving this game would be to add at least three more levels, maybe in the sequel.However this would be an excellent game for renting!"
3,*Yawn*,"This is an ok shooter in the Resident Evil universe, but after all the waiting for Playstation owners, I expected more than this from Capcom. All we got was a port of Code Veronica with a few extras thrown in and now this? I've bought every RE game for PS1 and 2, a total of 8 games (2 versions of both Part 1 and 2). Don't get me wrong here, this is a good game worth the money, but hopefully Outbreak will be more in line with what RE should be. Running, gunning, visceral terror. Excuse me, I have to go buy a Gamecube now..."
4,"Wonderful game, but too short......","It's a good game. I enjoy it when I played in the mid-night and turned off all lights. However, you can finish it very easy in couple hours if you are good in RE. If you don't like to waste time on long long RPG, and hate some easy boring games, this game will be good for you to kill 2 to 5 hours. I would like to play it again and again. However, guncon 2 is very important for this game. If you don't have one, get one! Otherwise, you will lose a lot fun."
1,wack to the third power,man if you buy this wack game something is wrong with you mentally. i want to write capcom a hate letter for this game. i dont know what they were thinking makin this crap!
1,Operational Platitudes - All Flash and No Substance,"Overall, I was very disappointed with this book. I agree with the general concept of Costanza's philosophy, but he left out the chapter on how to actually deploy his methodology. Platitude after platitude, I read about the results I could expect, but was left empty handed when it came to implementation. In addition, I felt that I have already read about this concept while reading about the Toyota Production System and Goldratt's Theory of Constraints among other mathematically based technologies. It appears that all Costanza has done is packaged and marketed existing manufacturing methodologies into a ""new"" technology."
2,perhaps a starting point,"Flow technology was once used at our organization but has been replaced by the traditional Lean and Six-Sigma tools and initiatives. Please make note the some formulas and definitions used in DFT are significantly different than standard Lean items and will cause confusion and some resistance if you try to mix them. Cycle time, takt time and kanban sizing are some examples. I purchased my book for a reference in addressing such issues."
1,Self promoter,"Self promotion 100%. Look at the dates on the 5 star reviews. All within one week of one another, and several the same day. Who is this man Costanza? A self promoter. Save your money and buy Lean Thinking."
5,Revelations of a Manufacturing Guru,This book is the greatest thing since sliced sushi. Who is this man Costanza? He's a genius! Two thumbs up!
4,Romantic rooms,"Sometimes astonishing, freqeuently amusing, this book is a peek behind the often closed doors of a variety of Irish homes. From the ""Militant Grandeur"" of great houses such as Castletown to the quirky cottage of two bachelor brothers with a passion for birds (""The Birdmen of Belmullet"") the pictures tell of an approach to decorating that is different from that prevailing in neighboring England. There is a whimsy and romanticism in Irish decorating style, both high and low, that is distinctive. As a frequent visitor to the Emerald Isle, I've been in some of the featured locations (Castletown, Bantry House) and can testify that the other featured locations are not unique. I found the interiors of some of the recently restored buildings to be very inspiring as well."
4,The homes - grand and small - of the Emerald Isle,"This book provides an illustrated tour of Ireland's homes. It doesn't shy away from the colonial past and even foregrounds how the grand country homes of the Anglo-Irish were an example of militant grandeur, the title of the first chapter. On p. 61, there's an extraordinary traveling shrine hung with 15th and 16th century Russian icons now found in Bantry House.At the end of the book there are cottages and buildings repurposed as houses. The photography is excellent. I've given it four stars because there's not an overall sense of Irish history but rather a series of different houses. But it's a lot of fun to look through and it's very well designed."
3,IRhythms Docking System,"This system does not support charging, a definite lack in an otherwise nice system with very good sound."
2,Got OCD? You'll love this tape!,"Audiophiles with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder will dig this one. Basically, this is a low-budget video that consists of a basic rundown of different tubes. A narrator identifies each tube as it is shown on the screen (each tube is shot against a plain backdrop). That's IT, folks! I'm sure that those ""in the know"" will appreciate it...and the passion for the subject matter clearly comes through in the production. However, for 99.9 % of us, this will be a big head scratcher."
5,Wow!,Every single chapter contains information that turns the world upside down and makes a huge difference in understanding the opposite sex! I had no idea we were so different - from the basics of physiology to how we view the world and how we think.It's helping me understand my coworkers and myself better. It's helping me bring understanding and tolerance to all my relationships. This will be required reading for my future romantic partners!The end-of-chapter summaries are a great help for anyone reading this a little at a time.Don't be fooled by the not-so-great cover design - this is a valuable and important read!
5,DECEPTION & LOVE--Fantasy in Top Form,"This is certainly one of the best books out there. S.S. has managed to create a medieval, as she lead us to believe, fantasy world of deception and intrigue.The nasty sister of a late greedy King comes around to her senses, to create a war fighting for land . In the process, she writes to teenage Meliara to call forth a meeting.Of course, she ends up blasting off ready to meet the lady, in turn bringing Vidanric, unwillingly, into the plans.He places a wager on her: if he reaches the inn before she does, she has to give him a kiss. Haha, it was quite a laugh when I found out who lost. But of course, it's these little things that add up in the end, making you feel shocked at the outcome of the novel.You will undoubtedly enjoy this book."
5,"I'm a nut when it comes to ""Court Duel""-argh YOU MUST READ!!","Ok. First off, I do have a life thank you very much. However, I don't know what comes over me, but when I start on Sherwood Smith's ""Court Duel"" and the 1st book in the duet, ""Crown Duel"" I go cookoo. This book may be short. The heroine Meliara may be annoying (BACK OFF MELIARA HATERS!! I HAVE A FLAME-MACHINE!!)...er...right, but once you ""get into"" the tale, you will be transported into another world that is faintly reminiscent of Machiavellian Italy full of intrigues, dark magic and romance. This book is remarkably sophisticated. A true gem...small and sparkling. [goes off to lala land]. The secondary characters are just as fascinating as the main ones (I have this dream where Elenet and the Duke of Savona marry). Remalna is the kingdom's name--and what an awesome one--I'd LOVE to live there any day. Sherwood Smith, I salute you!"
5,#1 best fantasy I've read,"I hate fantasies! Actually, I hateD fantasies. After reading this book, I drastically changed my mind. I've always hated books that delt with demons, dragons, and battles. This book had battles, not blood and gore battles, but rivalry battles. Battles for suitors and love interests. This is truely, hidden though, a romance. The romance of Meliara and Vidanric, two young people who have no idea what is between them. When they find out, one reluctantly admits, while the other goes out of his way to claim love."
5,With a fan in my hand...,"Court Duel is one of the best books that I've ever read. It starts off in a castle, where barefoot Countess Meliara Astair of Tlanth is staring out of her window, pondering a letter that she recived from court. She is waiting for her brother, Bran, to visit, and little does she expect the people that he brings with him!One is his (!) fiancee, and the other is Mel's old arch-nemisis, the Marquis of Shevraeth. Bran's fiancee, Nee, convices Mel to go to court with them. Mel stumbles around court, but with Nee guiding her, she pulls it off.Then Mel starts recieving notes from a secret admirer who knows what's really going on behind the elegant Court masks.I love how, in this book, you don't expect Mel to get married to Shevraeth, but when you think about it, it's kind of imminent. I also love the bet that she makes with him-the stakes-a kiss."
5,If I could say it all in one line I'd be a genius...,"What can I say about this story that can possibly beat reading it yourself? The characters and world is so real, for a few days I had to supress urges to go down the nearest hill top and call for little people... If you're looking for a book that'd make you lose touch with reality, I guess you don't have to look that far after all..."
5,Gets better every time i pick it Up,"The first time I read Crown Duel I enjoyed it immensly, so much that I got the sequel Court Duel right after. I recently read Crown Duel again and it was so wondeful, all the subtle humor and irony behind what seems to be just a simple love story.Smith recognizes that true love takes time to develop and that lovers dont always say or do the right thing. it's just wondeful, the whole book, and i recommend all girls read if only to have a real role-model in Meliara."
5,Incredible!,"All I have to say right now is ""WOW!"" When I got this book I really didn't know what to expect, but once I started reading I couldn't put this book down! I stayed up all night reading it. I fell in love with all of the charaters the way they were woven into the story by Sherwood Smith. The Marquis of Shevraeth especialy makes the story move with grace and wonder - just as Mel makes you read on to see just what she will do next. (...), but read this book, you won't regret it!"
4,"Beautiful, yet slightly boring.","I loved Crown Duel. It was really fast paced, never boring and kept me in suspense. I can't say that I feel the same about this book. The beginning was interesting, but as the book progressed I wondered when it would finally pick up the pace. The middle of the book was rather dry, taking too much time to describe her wardrobe, hairdo etc. The letters to her ""Unknown"" were interesting, although I wasn't neccessarily suprised when he was revealed. Despite the slow as syrup middle, the fast paced ending definetly made up for it. I would recommend this book to readers of the first one, but it's not a book that can stand on it's own, it needs to be read with the first one, otherwise I would say that it isn't worth it."
2,reviewer,"I thought that this book was going to be really good because of all the great reviews but, unluckily, I was disappointed. This duo was interesting in a few places, enough to keep me going till the end, but the characters were not very consistent or well developed in my view. Bran I found very annoying, Mel's character seemed to change completely from the spunky hill girl to court wanna-be to lovesick girl. The secret letters were intriguing very briefly but the way he was revealed was unsatisfactory how Mel just fell in love with him like that. The letters were only about how to handle politics! Anyway, it was too bad...I was looking foreward to a great read."
5,Enchantingly Humorous Romance,"Girl fixing her castle. Brother, brother's finace, and Mr. Vidanric( marquis of shevraeth to-be king), drag girl to court. Girl is a fool. Girl doesn't know the difference from silk and ricebags. Girl bombarded with interesting men w/high positions. Girl gets bored. Then Girl receives a secret letter from ""secret"" admirer. Girl and ""secret"" admirer talk and get to know each other better. Girl & admirer bump into each other at a war. Girl KNOWS who admirer is...do you??? Read Court Duel and learn more about Girl aka Meliara Tlanth and her personal problems."
5,COUNTESSES- their other side of the coin,"A countess is dragged to Remalna's fancy dancy courts to make face. She's unexperienced with gowns and flirting with members of the opposite gender. A hell of a great book to read. Fabulously written, easy to follow, wonderful to escape in!"
5,"LIVES OF THE ""UPPER CRUST""","Court Duel was my introduction to the wonderful world of Sherwood Smith. It was with the greatest sadness that I finished reading her complete works. Ms. Smith is indeed a modern-day Robin Mckinley. She chronicles the lives, loves, and angst of the ""upper crust."" Her satire on the royal establishement in the Crown & Court Duet is priceless -- Vidanric/Shevaeth is the ultimate brilliant, cool-headed, and totally self-absorbed King. Meliara is bright, funny, and talented who is just ditzy and vulnerable enough to be totally blind to passes made at her."
5,Another Wonderful Book From Sherwood Smith!,"This is a wonderful, wonderful conclusion, to an amazing 2-book series. It has 'most all the characters from the first book, and a whole lot of grand new ones. Plus our beloved main character gets a secret admirer! This is a very fun read as well as a book that makes you think! I suggest you buy this, you won't be dissapointed!!"
2,Not Up to Par for The Demanding Reader (Court Duel),"*sigh* I wanted to like this book. I enjoyed ""Crown Duel"" and wanted to follow our feisty Countess on her adventure, but alas, she turned out to be a one-trick pony. By which I mean that all the drama is based on her persistently being suspicious of the man she was obviously destined to fall in love with. (These are books in the Romance genre so that was evident from the start.)Even so, I read and read, and then scanned and scanned, and finally just blew off a few pages here, and there, until I jumped to end and said... fine, back to the library with you.My advice: if you AREN'T an old lady, like me, that's more demanding of a book .AND. you enjoyed ""Crown Duel"" a lot, then give this one a try. But know that while Mel learns some history and manners, she hasn't become any more sophisticated when it comes to knowing who to trust and who to avoid."
5,Better than Crown Duel!,"This book was a really good read. I liked it better than court duel because court duel was a bit confusing and moved to fast but this book was great filled with dry humor and sweet romance, ya i know but i still like when the characters fall in love-better yet what they hate each other at first!! ... believe me it was perfect. OOh good read-daughter of the forest"
5,For lovers of Sailor Moon & Tenchi Muyo,"If you love Sailor Moon & Tenchi Muyo, then you will love Magical Project S. In this reality for Pretty Sammy, Tenchi is a director who apeers once. So, who's the main character? Lovable Sasami! It's cute & funny & is perfect for shojo anime lovers"
4,Fun - Fantasy - Sammy!!,"I love Japanese animation and I want to share that love with my kids. Unfortunatly, the majority of anime has themes and situations that are not particularly family friendly. This is not the case in the 'Magical Project S' series. All of the videos are delightful! The animation is very good, the characters are funny, and Pretty Sammy is awesome. My kids love this series and so do I. If you are in search of an anime series that you can share with anyone from 2 to 200, this is the series."
2,Not worth the price,"First problem is that you have to have the switch on the mike set to the same thing as the switch on the radio. They must both be on VOX, or both on PTT. If you mix that up, it wont work and you will be very confused. I first thought the mike switch was an override, but its not. Perhaps that is my fault.The second problem is that one of them was broken out of the box. The mic did not work. If the mic had worked, I would probably have figured out problem #1 much faster.The third problem is that the mic does not capture the sound well. People can not hear me clear at all. I have to hold it close to my mouth and yell. That worked since I was on a mountain. However, its undesirable. I do not recommend this."
5,Nice addition to the rig.,"Only problem I found with these is that the radio itself does not get load enough through the ear set. They are hard to hear in a noisy environment...especially with wind noise while riding motorcycles. Other than that, hands free while around the house or the mall, they are perfect."
1,whole bodt supplement,I don't have any positive or negative feedback about the product. I didn't notice a difference in the product.
2,Tape,"Description when I bought it said it had centimeters on the other side, had only inches and needed the centimeters."
3,great concept but leaky,Bought the first one a year and a half ago. Used it a lot. I like that I can make the Gription handle fit over bike handlebars so you don't need anything else to attach it to your bike(takes a small bit of force). Bought the second one 6 months ago so both me and my partner both have one. Both Griptions slowly leak if you let them tip over. They have proven leaky prior to being made to fit onto handle bars and before ever having been popped fully apart for cleaning. I thought my first one was defective but the second one proves they are not finished designing this product.
4,Unlike any Christmas CD you've heard,I love buying and listening to Christmas music CDs during the holiday season. My collection ranges from rock to country to pop to blues to dulcimer - vocal and instrumental. This CD puts some great jazz and R&B grooves behind Sonya's incredible singing. The love of the Lord comes through this woman's voice loud and clear. I pre-ordered this CD and couldn't wait to get it - luckily just in time for Christmas. This is a keeper.
5,Good Quality Images,"This book reflects the quality of all of Mr. Sibbett's publications. I use the images in computer applications and the quality of his images are far superior to other books I have bought. I like the range of complexity one book will contain. My finished lamps are only a few inches in size, his designs translate well to this new application of his designs."
1,such a disappointment,This item arrived broken with a missing vital piece on the handle. I am highly disappointed and am unable to return it. I suggest not purchasing.
2,Really tacky,"First of all, I won't return this because the hassle is just not worth the money.This is VERY POORLY made:1. The slot and cutter are on an slight angle so the cheese has to be put on thesurface on an angle to get an even cut.2. There are two additional cutting wires supplied, but no instructions as to howto install. I'll deal with that issue when the time comes. It is not apparent.3. The ""easing"" on the marble or finishing is totally uneven. Does not look verynice. That is on all four edges.If I saw this in a store I would never have bought it. So my recommendation wouldbe to keep shopping and avoid this product. I am assuming this works well, but I haven'tused it yet. If it is problematic it will be disposed of."
1,Really Disapointed,"The cheese slicer arrived broken with a piece missing that makes it impossible for it to work unless in possession. So, now I have an unusable, broken cheese slicer. Thanks, a lot.... I was really looking forward to this."
4,Handy little slicer,"Delivery of this item was super fast, which suit me well as I couldn't wait to get it for a party. The product works well in general and is a decent size.The only thing is that I returned my first one because I received it with some chips in the marble, only to receive this one with nicks in it as well. it also came with the wire disconnected from the handle and so I had to put it back together (not so hard if you get someone else to push while you screw the round handle back on).I am not going to return this one and order another as it slices perfectly well, but I just wanted to let others know so they won't expect it to be in perfect condition. The chips and scratches don't affect the function of the slicer so overall I am satisfied."
3,needs polishing,"I have played and owned Need For Speed Underground, Sega GT, Sega GT 2002, and Gran Turismo. Now, if you are looking for a simulation game where car physics are close to real, you are in the wrong place. If, on the other hand, you want some of the customization like NFSU and you want a fun game, this may be your ticket. The customization is great, there is no need to save up money and start beating races right away to start customizing, you can also tune your car without the need of beating races and earning money first, but of course, you do get better stuff the farther along in the game you go. Now, the physics just don't cut it for me, the cars do not react like they would in the real world, and that may turn most people off.All in all, I got this game used and at it's price, I got a good deal, it's fun and gives me something to do for a couple hours a day, although I would not reccomend this game to a real car enthusiast."
4,"if you want GT3, buy GT3...","i've read a lot of reviews on this game. i've played need for speed 2 on GCN. There isn't anything like GT3 for the GCN. this game is fast, has nice customization of the cars, decent tracks, good AI if you bump up the difficulty. the interface gets a bit into the weeds when you're customizing but once you get into the gaming it's great.i would beel better about the game if it was a bit less than $40. if you can get it for $20 go for it. GCN doesn't have too many racing games that are snappy and quick. this is a fast paced one with a different twist. but don't expect it to be GT3."
2,Not worth $40,"Okay this game doesn't totally stink. The only reason it's a 2 instead of a 1 is because i like the road track style racing it has. (on only two different road tracks, and like 5 different total tracks) But It isn't good enough to even be called a rip-off of gran turismo. they have kind-of simlar tracks. but not near as many. and on a rating of 1-10 for graphics auto modellista gets a 1. the cars look like they were drawn for a comic book or something. they don't even look real. you have a career but you don't have to buy cars. you have to earn like 10 if that and most of them aren't even that great. you can have any car you want and any number of cars you want for no cost. the game is not even a challenge. it sucks. i totally regret buying this game. its a waste of money. this game isn't even a fraction of the game that gran tuismo is... Don't waste your money to buy this game."
4,the mid level executive crisis in mid 20th century America,"Tom Rath represents the human being trapped within the financial, emotional and family restrictions that affected so many returning veterans of the Second World War. His struggle and quest for basic dignity and the resulting conclusions in the search for that reality make Sloan Wilsons novel enchanting and encompassing."
1,Don't Buy,The product arrived pretty much instantly. However this is an extrememly badly constructed offshore item. Upon trying to use it for even light duty it did not do the job. The clutch spun and the drill stopped over and over again (with the hammer drill which came with the item). This was old cheezy concrete that should have been drilled into like a hot poker going into butter. Shortly therafter the drill fell apart -- plastic pieces broke off the handle and the screws came out. I couldn't even get through one small job using it. I would not recommend it for even light duty by a homeowner.
5,tough as nails,"This is a replacement for the first one of these I bought...three years, over 200 hours of hammering and a few drilling, and one thirty foot, expansive wine cave later. I could tell the last one was dieing and had absolutely no room to complain, and immediately ordered a new one. I was surprised a $100 power tool lasted as long as it did. Totally satisfied."
2,Worked good until it stopped working,Worked really good for about a month when it just quit working. I been using a Makita for more than 2 year now without a problem.
5,Read this book,"Excellent book. Everyone should know what happened in the Soviet Union in the 20th century. Martin Amis is a great writer and he makes you feel the dread of the midnight knock on the door, the absurdity of the ""crimes"" being prosecuted, the brutality of the interrogations, the terror of the long train ride to the Gulag, and the insanity of those years under ""Comrade Koba""."
3,"Uhhh...yeah, Stalin was Evil with a Captial E!","Hey, if this book opens some eyes and leads readers to the works of Conquest and Solzhenitsyn then it has served its purpose. I found it interesting to read mainly because of Martin's style, which is very literary, and rare in most books body-slamming communism. The fact is we need more books like this, by writers that can appeal to the left-leaning literati types, books that will open their eyes to the greatest crimes of human history, crimes committed in the name of lofty lefty goals. Human engineering--which is what ALL socialism is--always needs violent coercive force, and Stalin is the most extreme example of this. The difference between Stalin and say...Castro, is quantitative not qualitative, a point Martin makes about the difference between Stalin and Lenin. Overall this is good pop history, and hopefully it will lead readers to more in-depth works."
4,Crie de coeur or something,"Every book, every word, that despises Stalin is important. Amis does a good job destroying whatever notions people might have that Uncle Joe was maybe not such a bad guy. He was a terrible guy. Right behind Hitler for worst guy ever. Here's the thing -- and Amis makes a point of it -- Hitler didn't last very long. Stalin lasted 30 years."
3,One photo is worth the price of the book,"The book relies too much on secondary sources, but one photo, possibly apocryphal, is worth the price of the book.It shows a man and a woman, looking somewhat like the painting 'American Gothic' by Grant Wood, before a table of meats.It is captioned ""ANTROPOPHAGI"". A Greek word: ""ANTROPO"" = MAN + ""PHAGI"" = TO EATMan eaters.PS--UPDATE: I read this book after writing this review, and the prose is stilted. The author loves namesdropping (Robert Conquest is a family friend). Once again, I was spot on judging the book by its cover--the best part of the book was indeed the 'maneater' photo."
1,"Propagating black myth of ""giant prison""","Wonderful question in editorial review: ""when 20 million died under a Bolshevik regime that ruled as if waging war against its own people. Why?"" Well, I hate to break it to you, silly but this is because it never happened. Not a single serious historic account of such an idiotic claim yet it continues to persist in the Western discourse. Why? Well, it feels better when the only true country of the people and for the people is painted all black. And whenever people in this country try to even think of uniting for the better living and greater fairness in distribution of wealth, they are immediately checked by images of ""evil Stalin"" and ""20 million dead"". But why the heck it is only 20 million? Amis's rival in anti-Sovetizm Mr. Solzhenitsyn claimed it was 60 million! Come on, Amis, don't be shy! If you are writing a lie, make it audacious, loud! Remember what your teacher, Dr. Goebbels said about lying and drop your inhibitions!"
1,What a waste of my time!!,"after reading about the sige of Stalingrad, I wanted to learn more about the soviet leader of that time. This book is nothing more than quotes and references to other books that the author must assume that we have all read before. It is a pompass book that has very little insight into Joseph Stalin. you will learn no hidden facts or secrets about him. I wouldn't bother giving this book away."
1,"The boy's a fool, just like his father","This pathetic little book is poorly written, cliche-ridden, and lousy history - yes, just like his dad and his dad's sad friend, the discredited serial liar Robert Conquest."
5,So well written it becomes a pleasure,"It is difficult for people to grasp the magnitude of what communism and Stalin brought to the world. We needed this book to feel it, make it real, become a part of it. It is a highly fast paced and readable work, written by a master of words. It is my first book of Amis, and I am impressed beyond belief....what a grand story teller!"
2,The truth in an unreadable form,This book is a failure if its purpose is to document Stalin's murders. Solzhenitsyn and Anne Applebaum have done it more than adequately. Amis has a lot of baggage concerning fellow-travelling family and friends which intrude here and is the real subject of this book. His personal concerns spoil his discussion of Stalin's crimes and the horrendous apparatus of death which the Bolsheviks created.I cannot see the point of this book at all. It is a tribute to self-indulgence as perhaps only an Englishman feels free to indulge.
3,Okay.,It was ok. Not the best I have read. I will save it and read again next year. I do like her books.
4,Better than the first one,"This book was a good read. I found it more interesting than the first one, although it seemed a little ""cheesy"" at times, but I still enjoyed it."
3,What is Random House thinking?,"I read this series years ago. I would love to re-read it again. However, I am not going to pay $7.99 (full price) for a twenty year-old-book. I have a choice of where to spend my $$$. Apparently, Random House doesn't want my business. It is their loss (as well as the author)."
5,Part 2 of 3; This one is just as good as the first WOW,This is one of my favorite trilogy reads. All three are wonderful from start to finish. I'm sharing all my 5 star reads in hopes you'll read this and like it as much as I did. This I actually read before I started leaving my reviews on Amazon. Happy reading. Don't forget there's 1 more in this series.
4,De~lovely,"Wolf leider is superlative.Bostridge is pretty stellar.Pappano is a wonderful foil.simply, a sweet trifecta.I enjoy Fischer-Diskau's interprations as well. Bostridge's tone brings another depth to this music for me."
4,Ashwagandha capsules.,"One retired physician of Indian descend recommended this herb for decreasing strees, better sleep, and other health issues. I have never taken pills before, shouldn't say, being sceptical, have tried for the past 3 weeks: it works. I am unable to be faithful with taking it twice a day, again, never taken more than two Tylenols a day. But from what I can judge, it really makes a difference. I am a professional: read all info available through professional sites: very few side effects. Yhere is one small study, that high doses can cause Thyrotoxicosis.The only drawback: huge capsule, have to position my head to let it pass throuhg my pipes.BZOB."
5,really good,It takes few weeks to feel the difference in your mood but once you start feeling the advantage ashwagandha you will need it everyday. it is awesome!!
2,Beware of long term use,"Arrived in good time and in good condition. I use it to help me sleep. 450 mg. keeps me feeling exhausted and weak for the entire day following use. 225 mg. or less seems to work fine. Long term it causes painful gastrointestinal issues and is quite likely responsible for reducing my white blood cell count.Safety and dosage information on it is hard to find. It is not FDA approved, and obviously a powerful medication. At times I find it a necessary evil. For short term use, it did allow me to get some sleep. Insomniacs: please use with extreme caution!"
3,Ashwagandha,Been taking the product for almost a month and I haven't noticed any benefits or side effects. Will keep taking.
4,I'm not sure if it really works,I've been taking these supplements for a few months. I do feel a little more positive and hopeful. I think I'm not stressed or negative. Maybe it's all in my head. But I'll keep taking them.
4,Stuff works to calm,"One pill was enough to calm my stomach, which then makes it easier for me to return to an alpha wave dominant pattern brain. Basically, it enables you to be alert and focused, yet calm. Two pills gives me a stronger calming effect, but I didn't like the side effect feeling kind of slow."
2,"Questionable effectiveness, numerous side effects.","This herbal remedy seems to make me feel more energetic sometimes. I wouldn't describe the minimal effect as more energy per se, as I would describe it as being more playful.Again numerous side effects, the minimal benefits do not outweigh the costs."
5,Great product,"A very good quality product. I will continue to buy it. If you are looking for a good Ashwagandha then you no longer need to look around, you have arrived at right place!"
3,not as innocent as buck privates//costello tries too hard,..good sequel /top of film is padded with original buck privates//segments of the film are too serious//costello is not as innocent /right//left sequence is funny//midget race car sequence is excellent.
4,Abbott & Costello in top form,"Another rare case of a sequel topping the original. There is some effective sentiment to go along with the clowning. Along with 'The Time of Their Lives' and 'Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein', this one ranks as one of the boys' best."
5,BEST ADVENTURE BOOK WRITTEN,I read this book 20 years ago and have tried to find another copy... just did find a paperback and enjoyed the book all over again.. I couldn't put it down the first time and couldn't this time either. The cover of the book said soon to be a movie?? Has anyone heard or seen such ?
5,"Fast paced, a very good read.","I thought this was an excellent, fast paced read. Scott sucks you into the story and leaves you wanting more. I lost my copy or loaned it out, either way I am looking for another. If anyone has one let me know."
5,The Ship Killer,"This was an excellent book! Only problem is, I like to share books I love and have given all my copies away. Still I feel I need more to give to my favorite people - Has there been a re-write? Has anyone out there read any other books by Justin Scott - how do they compare?"
3,Maybe its me...,"...but it seems Mr. Carroll's recent efforts have declined. I have been eagerly reading each new work since I came across Bones of the Moon years ago, but have found little to enthrall me recently. His cool monikering of characters continues (Anjo? King of the Park? Love it!) but his ability to make us care for these characters has diminished. There is a scene late in the book where the protagonists' son says what a great dad he has, despite the philandering, and prolonged absences throughout his life. I am not being moralistic here, but if I don't like and respect the character at this point in the book, some feeble accolades from a minor character are not likely to motivate me. As usual the plot is intriguing, but there are some laughable moments of absurd romanticism (my eef? My God!!). Want a great read? Try Leif Enger's Peace Like a River. Remarkable."
2,Except the animals at the zoo,"The story is merely a vehicle for ideas which don't hold up to analysis. Although the style is fine, nothing is very interesting."
1,Very disappointed,It's not well written or interesting. I'm glad I took it out from the library instead of buying it.
1,a waste of time and money,"I read about one novel a week, and I can read virtually any genre, including magic realism. A book has to be pretty bad for me to put it down. Actually, I did not put this one down, I threw it across the room after reading a scene where the leading couple is in the elephant cage at the zoo and a group of children take the trunk of the baby elephant and pull it through the bars until its head pops and the elephant dies. The book does not have this violent tone up until this point (which is about 3/4ths of the way through), and this scene seems to pop up out of nowhere. I was slogging along trying to involve myself in the plot (which is weak), and I just couldn't take any more. I do not recommend this book, even as a loaner from the library."
3,Odd duck,"What a crazy ride of a book!Vincent Ettrich is an unrelenting womanizer who wakes to discover that he has died and has been reborn. But for what reason?With the help of vivacious guardian angels and helpful unborn children, Ettrich learns Chaos has found the joys of consciousness and refuses to give these up, with devastating potential consequences for the world.Definitely an Odd Duck!"
5,beautiful and haunting,"I enjoy Jonathan Carroll's style, characters, and elements of magical realism, and this book lived up to everything I've come to expect of him. White Apples was a beautifully written story with a very interesting philosophy and a deeply moving conclusion."
1,Not enjoyable for me,"A friend who thoroughly enjoyed this book sent me a copy. I wish I felt the same but ... ugh. I thought there was a lot of sloppy writing with ideas that just dead-ended. I found it a generally annoying, frustrating read full of clumsy ""telling."" An occasional line popped up that I appreciated, such as this description of a character: ""... three quarters perfection, one quarter broken glass."" But otherwise ... I'd like the hours of my life back that I spent reading it."
4,very good ballet production based on a fairy tale,"This ballet is based on a children's fairy tale but produced for adults. The production is to complicated for children to enjoy. The video quality is lacking in color due to the stage lighting, but still enjoyable to watch. Plenty of dancing as compared to ballets with half dancing and half acting."
1,Jack Horn is the Anti-Mgrs author of what Tom Peters writes!,"When I read excerpts from this book, I thought it was a joke, a gage to what managers are trained by the gurus of top management seminars such as Tom Peters, to name one."
4,A Nice change of pace,"I bought this CD on vinyl when it first came out.This album is a bit out of the normal for Jethro Tull but still a worthy addition to your collection.Elegy is one of Tull's finer songs ever.Fly by Night from his first solo album is vibrant and works well with an orchestral arrangement.War Child from the album of the same name has excellant orchestration and is worth the price of the CD alone.The problem with the CD are the tired versions of Aqualung and Locomotive Breath and even worse, Too Old to Rock and Roll.It would have been nice to hear other songs from their catalog such as, Black Sunday, Pine Martens' Jig or possible Dun Ringill..Ian Anderson and Martin Barre along with other memebers contribute to the album to make it even more worth while.Jethro Tulls' music adapts nicely to this format.I strongly recommend it to any Tull fan.........."
2,I really wanted this to be great--I love Marilu's others,"I am a big fan of the THM lifestyle. I have been waiting for this book since it was first discussed on her website. I wish I could give this book more stars but I think I am being nice giving it two. The recipes are good but they are much like the other books and then there are those lists...for example on Mother's day she reccomends listens to a vintage Pink Flyod album simply because 'mother' is in the title and she reccomends watching 'The Last Temptation of Christ' as an easter movie?! It seems like she just did a computer search for matching names. I gave up reading anything but the recipes when I got the Passover song that went to the tune --'There's no business like show business'.In conclusion the recipes are OK but if you don't have any books go for some real gems like the healthy Life Kitchen, the 30 day one or THM or even get 'Dairy Free Cooking' all have great recipes without the junk. I hope her next book is better."
4,A self help book for the beginning social dancer,"This book reads like a self help book to build the confidence of beginners who are attempting to brave the social dance scene. Though it mentions several different reasons why social dancing is so enjoyable, it mostly focuses on meeting women or men and delves into why it is a great way to meet the right types of people - for romance as well as for friendship. The book also provides some tips on how to get started and some resources, although the author focuses mostly on swing dancing. This is a well-written book for the complete beginner, although most people getting into social dance already know why they want to learn. The book does not go much deeper than social interaction and so does not appeal to the intermediate or advanced social dancer."
4,A FUN BOOK TO READ THOUGH IT IS SOMETIMES CONFUSING,"This is a fun book to read, but toward the end of it it gets kind of confusing with all the switching of workers and their bosses. I think a highlight of this book is Elizabeth and Todd, and Amy and Ken!"
3,Helpful with limited applications,"I'd recommend this book for those unfamiliar with ritual abuse. While Colin Ross presents his views fairly, survivors and their allies will receive little in any helpful information that may be considered useful to their healing. I'm wondering how anyone can write a book about treating ritual abuse survivors and the conclude that he still isn't really sure his clients were ritually abused?He allows Elizabeth Loftus her prejudice in denying survivors accounts. Since she makes a living denying the experiences of others, the space he provided could have been more justly given to a survivor. In spite of these limitations I walked away with a sense that the author is sincere in his desire to help. While Dr. Ross may be unable to understand the realities of ritual abuse completely, he's heading in the right direction."
2,Satanic abuse without satan?,"I was hoping to learn something about therapy for those abused in Satanic rituals, especially as children. Unfortunately, the writer presents the popular view that Satanic abuse is strictly psychologically based, done by people who are mentally ill. It is not possible to be satanically abused if Satan is not the cause of the abuse. Satan is not a mental illness. Satan is a very real devil who uses real people to torture and mutilate people's minds and bodies, especially children. After deliverance from Satan (typically by a Catholic priest) then the person needs help because his psyche has been warped. But as long as the existence of Satan is denied then those who have been abused in Satanic rituals will not be helped. This was another party line book which denies the existence of the author of Satanic abuse."
3,Interesting but flawed,"Ross (a psychiatrist) argues well on the treatment and diagnosis of MPD, but many of his other arguments are flawed. In his section on the history of cults and secret societies (upon which tries to base his argument that multi-level,""orthodox"" satansim exists) he relies on a small number of books which themselves are highly debatable, and extrememely unscholarly. Most of them are the usual run-of-the-mill conspiracy theories involving how the Masons are trying to take over the world by subliminally inserting satanic ideas into children's movies. Thus the conclusions he reaches about the ""evidence"" for ritual abuse (other than recovered memories) contains flaws and immense logical leaps. Since his background is psychology we might forgive him for this, but he definitely should have performed more thorough research before writing his book."
4,Leatherman,"This is a useful tool, I have taken it with me almost everywhere. There are things in here to help you do the minor things you need to do."
1,works great! unless you want to cook with it.,"What is the point of a food processor that only works if you first chop the vegetables into small uniform pieces? It is easier, cheaper, faster, and you get a better result if you just finish the job yourself with a knife and cutting board. I thought that this would work like a mini version of our other cuisinart food processor but its more like the toy model version. It looks great, but don't try to actually cook with it."
1,very weak,"I wish I could return it. Trying to chop some onions in it , it was so weak it would not do it"
2,mini -prep grinder,i am not happy with this product.it does not grind well ..i had a off brand mini grindder that did a better job.....i do not use it and it was a waist of moneys ......looks nice !i have to open the lid and constantly scrape the sides so i stopped using it ...........looks nice !i wish i could return it ..ss
4,Exactly what I wanted!,"The Cuisinart DLC-155 Mini-Prep Processor is exactly what I needed after moving into a very small space...""One Butt"" kitchen. It is very powerful,(take care not to overprocess)looks great,and easy to clean. Take care reversing the blades; VERY SHARP!!!!!! MC"
4,"Works well, plastic container kind of cheap quality","I have been very happy with this product. It works well and not a bad price. My only gripe is the plastic container. The quality is not great, but I guess you can't expect too much better for the price."
5,Mini Master !,This is by far the best compact FP I have ever used. right from the days of using it as a bachelor till now as a family man i am very much impressed by its power and ease of use. its small but very powerful. for a 2 people family its very useful. even for a big family i recommend this as secondary.
5,Simply love this product!,"I don't normally think to write reviews, but just wanted to say that how much I love this Cuisinart mini-prep processor. It is the perfect chopper and I really love this product. I have bought this product 2 yrs ago and still working best. its easy to clean and space saver as well. Highly recommended!"
2,Disappointed,This thing doesn't chop. It pulverizes. I tried to chop a green pepper in it and instead I got green pepper soup.
3,Nice but tiny,"I love the Cuisinart brand, but this particular food processor was quite small. It's great for small jobs or a single person."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PROCESSOR!!!,A few years ago I purchased one of these mini processors to make pesto. I used it only three or four times then it stopped working. Chopping basil is not heavy duty use. The worst part is that Cuisinart refuses to stand behind their product. They said that they would help me in purchasing a new product but that's it. Why on Earth would I want to pay for a new one when the previous one was a piece of junk?! I would have given this item no stars but that wasn't an option so I was forced to give it one. Save your money. Don't buy Cuisinart products.
4,cuisinart mini-prep processor,"This is my second mini processor. I still have my first one-about 5 years. My husband shapened the blade as it had become dull. Would be lost without it. Use it for chopping onions and garlic mostly. Another use is to make fresh bread crumbs, and I like it to grind up Romano or Parmesan cheese. Came in handy to puree baby food this week-end."
2,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed with my processor. It only chops the bottom parts not the top. No matter how many small or few pieces you put in the container, it won't chop the top. My husband just pulsates it and it works better. Much more time consuming then my old $5 one!!!"
2,little food processor that barely could,"Having owned and used both the next size up mini-processor and the very big brother, when the motor failed on my old dlc-2, i immediately ordered this as a good replacement...well, that was wrong!! First, this unit is smaller, and even a little smaller makes a big difference as you cant really fill these to the top. Second, this unit lacks the convenient bi-directional rotation of the next model up...this one has two speeds, but only turns in one direction. To change from chop to grind, you have to remove the blade completely, turn it over and then reinsert it in the machine. Finally, while this unit does nice work on very soft and very small items, it is not very good with any item of any size or hardness. So, if you work mostly in small quantities with very small or soft ingredients, this is probably OK. If not, spend a few more bucks and save yourself a lot of grief. For $10 more, you get double the machine!!"
3,Disappointed,"Great looking mini-processor, but not big on power. The shiny chrome showcases fingerprints; it's hard to keep clean."
1,Only buy this if you want your food PULVERIZED!,"Do NOT buy this food processor if you are hoping for a cheap way of chopping your onions and veggies! it completely destroys them- as in, grinds them into mush- no matter how short of a time you try to chop them in. In fact, they should just replace the ""chop"" button with the word ""mush"". It would be more honest frankly. If you only want to use this to make salad dressings and the like, you may be ok- but then again, why not just save yourself some money and use a whisk?"
2,Not Pleased with the Performance,"I have not been happy with this product. In fact, I am considering returning it or selling it in a yard sale. It does not chop the vegetables (onions, peppers, etc.) in a consistent way. It either makes puree out of them or leaves large chunks that must be chopped up by hand. I have another little mini processor that is cheaper than this one, and it works a lot better. I bought this one because of the Cuisinart name, and I have been really disappointed."
2,"Alright, but not really useful","The only people I tend to cook for are me and my husband. I begged him for a food processor for my birthday after seeing his mom's (she has the gigantic 14 cup cuisinart from the 80's and I swear that thing runs like a truck). I was so excited to have a little one to help me with batches of pesto.However, this thing really doesn't do much. It tends to shove everything up above the blade, and I spend more time taking the lid off and stirring stuff around than I do actually getting anything done with it. It's quicker for me to chop by hand and as for purees, it's easier to use a blender than to bother with this. I'm hoping to get a larger cuisinart soon."
1,Does not work!,"I bought this item since it has a very good review by costumers, however, the processor I received does not turn on. It seems its motor does not work. So I paid like $30 for it and I could not use it even for 1 second. Maybe it's my bad luck but I feel it is my responsibility to inform such problem may occur to you too."
2,does not handle big jobs,"The machine works fine, but only on small amounts of food at a time. Example, I can only chop half an onion at a time even if cut small"
1,Poorly designed -- very cheaply constructed,"I have only used this processor three times, and now the blade assembly is cracked. A new blade assembly ( my processor is out of warranty ), with shipping, is $16.90, but the complete Cuisinart mini processor new, with free shipping from Amazon, is just $29.99. This Cuisinart mini processor is just CHEAP JUNK !! The motor on my unit also smells of overheating with just light chopping. This is most definitely a DO NOT BUY appliance !! I will buy another processor, but NOT another one of these, and I will do my best to avoid Cuisinart entirely !"
5,Love This Little Unit!,"I bought the Cuisinart mini-prep processor when my son was 8 months old. My son refused to eat baby food but was too small to eat all ""our"" food. I had a big food processor but it was a pain to drag it out every day and yet it was too big to sit on my counter all the time. So I purchased the Cuisinart mini-prep processorI have been very happy with the mini-prep processor. I use it mostly for processing our food so my son can eat it but my husband has used it for chopping coffee beans and chopping herbs and cheese. The unit is attractive looking, easy to clean, easy to use and inexpensive.The unit comes out of the box including:* 21-ounce Lexan Work Bowl and cover* Chopping/mixing blade assembly* Two-speed Motor Base* Customized Spatula* Recipes* Use and care booklet* 18-month limited warrantyThe Cuisinart mini-prep processor is a powerful unit that comes in very handy for small jobs. I would recommend this mini food processor to everyone who is looking for a smaller processor."
2,Not what I hoped for,"This was just not what I hoped for. I love my magic bullet, but I was looking for something to work as well yet with larger capacity. This had larger capacity but could not even chop up garlic unless it was already partially chopped--so what's point? It was just cheap and ineffective for what I wanted."
5,I LOVE IT,"Great little processor for the money. I crush dry beans and dog kibble easily and fast. Have no need to process large amounts at a time as it would not stay fresh. This one works nicely, efficently and cleans up so easily. I process daily soups for my dogs. This is just the right size. Easy to use, clean and is versitile for wet foods and dry foods. I would purchase it again for gifts if need to"
4,Little Power House,"This is a great machine for those folks who basically want mush. You have to have Superman reflexes to slow this thing down, but it does a great job. There is a dull and a sharp side to the blade, but won't matter....both sides will make mush out of an onion in no time flat. But, for me, just so I don't have to chop the onion by hand is a blessing. I guess once you get the hang of it, you can get it to just chop in larger pieces, but so far, it has been juice city for me. But, this little devil has plenty of power and is great looking and super easy to clean. I would give it an A minus. Worth the money!!"
2,little is less...,"There are only two of us in hour household, so I thought purchasing this little processor would be okay. However, its just not powerful enough. I was disapointed with the purchase but will live with my choice."
4,Works as advertised!!,"I was curious why this product got some single star reviews. I can only conclude that the users of this item didn't RTFI (read the following instructions). Chopping onions and garlic was a snap when utilizing the instructions provided, which consisted of using the low setting and pulsing until the desired size was achieved. I'm very happy with the performance of this mini-prep and for the price it is an outstanding buy. Oh, and the complaint about having to chop food items up before putting them into the mini-prep is without culinary merit. If you've every had to mince garlic or onions or fruit to prepare a meal then having to make a few 1/2"" chops wouldn't be an issue. I'll take making a few cuts at an onion over having to mince one by hand any day of the week. The mini-prep minces so well that it really takes a lot of the manual labor out of preparing a meal to cook for the family."
3,Not Great for chopping nuts,I purchased this mini processor to replace an old one from a different manufacturer. I mainly use it to chop a variety of nuts. I am disappointed in the performance. The pieces are very inconsistent in size and there are a lot of crumbs.
3,Processor,Looks very nice sitting on my counter. Works well. Just a little small. Actually very small. Did I mention its small?
5,Just what I was looking for!,I previously had a mini processor which I did not like because the blade was not close enough to the bottom of the bowl to pick up all the product. This one is and works beautifully! Also I like that I can switch the blade to chop really hard things like nutmeg.
2,cuisinart schmuisinart,"not worth the trouble. get a small regular one.the drip mechanism for making mayonnaise is especially irratating, spills all over the place. and you have to stand there and hold the key down for the machine to work. dumb. plus it's deafening, a particularly high-pitched scream."
4,A Great Little Machine,"I've had this machine for about 10 years now after my husband INSISTED that I stop chopping onions by hand during the construction of Thanksgiving dinner. He brought this home and well, I've been loving it ever since. I do mostly use it for onions, but it is wonderful for spices and nuts too. I just can't believe how powerful the motor is in this guy - it seems as if it could grind beef! Mine has turned yellow (it was white) with use but I think I'm going to rebuy it in stainless steel. Anyway, the price here on Amazon is quite good since my husband paid $34 for it 10 years ago! I think I'm going to ahve to buy a larger one because this one is getting too small for our family. I don't like the way it cleans up, however, it can be a little much when you do onions. You HAVE to put it in the dishwasher for sure if you do onions because the plastic definitely holds the odor. Wish it was glass! Great machine for the money and I highly recommend it."
1,Really Bad Mini Chopper,"I purchased this chopper when I gave my old trusty Black and Decker mini chopper to my daughter when she left for college. I decided to treat myself to a up-scale chopper that looked nice on my counter. I have had a large Cuisinart for years and have never regretted that choice. I read the reviews and although I saw a somewhat positive overall score, I failed to realize that the only people who liked this machine were those who puree things or make smoothies. For the rest of us, this appliance is useless. It does a terrible job of chopping onions, carrots, herbs, nuts and just about anything at all. Pieces are unevenly chopped. When chopping onions, you end up with a soupy puree with a few large chunks floating in it. Sounds unappetizing doesn't it. Actually I never realized how great my cheap little B&D chopper was. So I am giving this away to the Salvation Army and returning to my un-sexy but ever so effective old chopper."
1,Should come with a disclaimer,"Same thing happened to me as to another reviewer. I was mixing a small amount of aleady grated Parmesan cheese with breadcrumbs I had just made in the processor, and the blade must have hit a small chunk of cheese and went right through the side of the bowl, putting a hole in it and breaking in half. Scared the heck out of me, breadcrumbs all over the place, and a broken blade and bowl. Would cost me $24 to replace both, so I might as well buy a new one (a different brand, of course!). I'm mostly just glad I didn't get hurt."
2,Very limited use,"I have had this model for about 2 years and I found it very disappointing. In order for it chop up an onion, for example, you need to hand cut the onion into several *very small* pieces -- otherwise the blades chop some of the onion and leave other parts unchopped. It's good for items that are already small --like nuts, but it's a nusiance for chopping vegetables. Another issue: the plastic lid is of poor quality -- the lid has developed a small hole on top and now I have to keep my finger over the top to prevent liquid from spraying out. This mini chopper is a good idea with poor execution. I am surprised these are still being made."
2,Would send it back if I knew how,"I wish I hadn't thrown away my old chopper when I got this one. It is a perfect size, but the chopping leaves much to be desired. It leaves a combination of huge chunks and liquid mush when chopping onions. I will play with it some more and see if I can figure out a way to make it consistent."
2,Dosen't Chop,"This machine looks nice, but it dosen't chop very nice. It just turns my vegetables in a mashy, ground-up mess! You should get one of the manual ones with the rotating blades. I'm back to the old knife and cutting board method. It's a heck of a lot easier! I like the design and appearence of this machine. Only if it worked as good as it looks it would be perfect! You can't put ice or thick things in this or it will wreck it. My friend had a similar one and they busted the hell out of it after putting ice in it. I told her you have to use a blender for that stuff. Also, the blades are SO SHARP they sliced my thumb after hardly touching it!"
1,Okay,"This is okay for chopping cilantro, but does not puree very well. I my mind it does not live up to the Cuisinart name. Much prefer my old Sunbeam Oskar."
1,Not very useful,"This is not a very useful product, it does not come with all the attachments of a larger food processor.All I really bought it for was to chop, but it tends to just make a mush out of whatever I put it in, despite numerous attempts to vary my method. It simply will not uniformly chop things like onions that I wanted to save time from doing by hand."
5,Love it! Easy to use.....Easy to clean!,I have to puree my veggies and fruits. This is so very easy to use and such a quick clean up that I can go from one item to the next with a quick rinse.
1,Never Worked,"I bought this in preperation for having gastric bypass because I didn't want something huge on my counter when I would only be pureeing maybe 3 oz of food at a time. Well, I tested it when I took it out of the box and it turned on and worked but 3 months later when I actually went to use it...nada. Completely dead and I hadn't ever even put food into it. I no longer have the box or receipt so I don't know if I can return it. I may just junk it after reading these reviews and buy something better, despite the size."
1,"Cuisinart Mini-prep is JUNK, do not waste money","I purchased the last piece off the shelf and that did not work and I replaced it next day with the seller.The exchanged one worked well just for four times of half an hour each in my house and then fifth time it will not move at all. This product is warranted for 18 months,I had it for just five months, but the secret they won't tell is that for replacement I have to pay $10.00 to get a new one and HAVE to send them the bad one on my own expense. This process will get me the same junk for the original price (almost) I paid. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK.Thanks,TSS"
4,Its great and small!?!?!,The one con I have is that I did not realize how small this item is!SMALL!Now I am sure if I had read more on the add it said the size specs. somewhere on the listing but I did not. My girlfriend has made me wonderful food and she has a gluten allergy so cooking and processing our food is critical.This little guy is doing its job admirably.
5,Nifty and Nice,I bought two of these and gave one as a gift. Mine has come in very handy obviously for small jobs that get lost in my big processor. I do a lot of cooking have not yet used it for a wide variety of things but am imagining I will need it for limited applications anyway. I get very tired of washing out my big processor after little jobs. This is very quick to clean. The price was very attractive. MAH
1,Died on first usage,"Already the owner of a Cuisinart coffee maker that I love, I requested and received the Cuisinart Mini-Prep Processor as a Christmas gift this year (2011). The first time I used it (January 29, 2012), the small batch of cooked and already hand-chopped chicken shredded the chicken beautifully. Alas, that was the end of it. When I immediately added a second portion of chicken to shred, the device had died and refuses to turn on again. I read the trouble-shooting tips, plugged it into a different socket on a different breaker, but nothing. Dead. It seems to me Cuisinart appears to have some serious quality control issues with this product."
1,"yeah i had one, it was a pain in the ass!","i'll make this short and simple. it mashes. it dosent chop. it is supposed to mince and chop vegetables not destroy them, which it most certainly does. So seriously, WHAT IS THE POINT? It just creates more hassle and frusteration, and dishes to wash. Don't expect dry uniform chopped vegetables. You will always get clumps of mashed vegies. This piece of junk cannot and will not replace the consistency of just using a knife."
1,dont waste your money,"We bought this shortly after our daughter was born. My wife was going to use it for the encapsulation process for her placenta...she put a few dehydrated chunks in, and the processor BROKE!!! all broken would run but wouldnt spin in a matter of seconds! dont waste your money, you want something that is going to work all the time, not just the first 5 seconds!"
3,Help?,"What's the difference between the DLC-1BCH and the DLC-1SS? They look the exact same, cost the same, and seem to have the same functions? Thanks!!!!!!"
1,This is JUNK,"Right out of the box, this thing could not chop a medium size onion cut into quarters. It pulverized half of it and left the rest in huge chunks. Not worth the box it came in. I threw it out after trying it once."
3,Breaks easy,"I liked this food processor and it met the needs of my girlfriend and myself for quite some time. It made salsas, ground meat, etc. pretty well and it was okay.. up until the day I dropped the plastic lid and it literally shattered. I didn't intentionally drop it and it barely fell a foot to the ground yet it inexplicably broke into many, many pieces rendering the whole thing completely unusable. According to amazon.com, getting a new lid would cost me nearly as much as the food processor itself did. So really, that's not worth it. I'm going to take the time to just buy a new one, perhaps one with not so easily broken parts.Another note is that when using it on high speed there was a bit of a weird smell that it made, even if you were using that setting appropriately. Maybe I just got a defective product, but I'm not sticking with the Kitchenaid regardless."
2,Not enough capability,"I bought it for prepare baby food. It took a very long time to puree the food. There still little piece of food left after I puree for a long time. I end up refund it, and buy a blender. It work better with a blender."
1,Very Dull Blades,I was not expecting for a Cuisinart product to perform so poorly. The first time I used it the blades would not cut through anything! I was in shock! I mean it was a brand new machine and it simply did not work! A huge disappointment!Would not refer it to anyone!
1,i cut myself every time i clean it,"great chopper until you try to clean it. to screw the blade on tight, you are safe, to take the blade out of it's compartment to clean it, you must twist in the same direction as the sharp blades. this is the reason i am typing with one hand without the time to use caps b/c i am bleeding!no one thought about the design of this piece of junk."
2,Product doesn't live up to the Cuisinart name..,"the only good thing i can say about this product is that it does a good job if you want to only chop a few nuts or veggies..the motor is not powerful enough to grind up ice cubes and if you are using an type of liquid it leaks just enough to make a mess..it is not designed to make smoothies or blend liquids..this product is only good to chop a small quantity and frankly if that is what you want to do, i would recommend using your chopping board."
3,decent for what it is,"This is a good little machine with limitations. it is very cheaply made. no question about it. I expect it will last a few months. BUT, for the price I can either get it replaced or just keep buying new ones. Not the best consumer mentality, but I think that's how it's going to be. It IS very small. I had anticipated making sauces with it but even for small meals you need to do it in several batches. I tried shredding vegetables in it and it nipped away at the outer skin of it but left me with some round balls of vegetable matter that required quite a bit of shifting. It's easy to clean and while it has quite a few drawbacks, I see this getting much more use than my larger machines because of it's overall ease."
2,too little,"Well, I don't blame the product, but this little bit of a thing is not what I expected. I guess I did not pay enough attention to the description.For the price, I could have gotten a larger processor at Walmarts store with a chute that delivered the processed stuff to a bowl.None of these seem to really work the way we imagine. don't think you can pop a carrot in there and it all will process. There will be these lumps left over to separate from the mix.My processors years ago used to slice. This just grinds small bits.I'll use it, but it is not the joy I imagined. Yesterday I sliced with one of those cheap aluminum hand cheese graters and that was great. It grates too. I keep trying to buy something that is easy, like a mandolin I bougnt, but I end up chopping and slicing most often with a knife.Oh, I also found this very akward to assemble with food.Not mucn of a raving success I guess but if I want finely chopped veggies for a soup it will work I guess."
5,Cuisenart,"I have all of the big models, but needed something for for just the small jobs. Good product, Good business to deal with."
1,Mini Prep Processor Junk,"Got this item and worked great the first time....then I made another butter paste a month later and it did not work. The motor died on it. Then I came on Amazon to see how I can return it and come to find out it had only a 30 day warranty which I missed 3 days out. This is ""JUNK"" and a lot of money has been lost due to this return policy! Do not get this item...I also believe that when customers are dissatisfied with their products a company should respond and correct these issue quickly. I do hope Amazon does not try to play the silent and ignore the problem GAME like ""Wal-mart""!"
2,can't handle the daily grind,"Brought to us by the same rocket scientists who made the world's most dangerous waffle iron. This thing grinds coffee like a money can grind a piano. Despite what the outside of the packaging says, this IS NOT a replacement for a proper coffee grinder. Even using the blunt side of the blades, the best you can hope for is a coarse ground after half a minute on the HI setting; a far cry from the fine grounds that my old Braun grinder (R.I.P.) produced in seconds. The Cuisinart pulse food processor is a different story altogether (a solid workhorse, that), but their low-end products are nothing less than dangerous and duplicitous."
1,Does a terrible job of chopping if your looking for a good one,"Then go with the Ninja Master Prep. I bought both and the Cusinart turned an onion into mush. When i tried to just pulse it the pieces were very inconsistant, so I pulsed a littlemore and it turned it to mush. On the New Ninja Master Prep. It has only pulse one speed, but its more powerful and the mini base has four blades, two like the cusinart and two more above them so if you put a half an onion in and give it one short pulse your done. I had to chop garlic the Ninja chopped it up perfectly. Its more money than the mini cusinart but its a muchbetter unit."
3,Ten minute's use requires fifteen minute's cleaning.,"I find it a little difficult to get the get the consistency I want. Some things get liquefied if the chunks are too big and I want to try for a little smaller. What I wind up with is liquid -- but still with some chunks in it! That, for me is not too bad; I just wanted it for small amounts where hand slicing/chopping wouldn't do the job. I have had the Cuisinart Mini-Prep for three-and-a-half years and used it again, tonight, for the first time in two years! Then I remembered why I had not used it. The parts have too many small grooves and recesses which just do not wash cleanly -- easily. After brushing and scrubbing the disassembled parts I find that to get off all the small smears of food I have to resort to Q-Tips to get the numerous little, tight angles and grooves clean. It's a hygiene horror!"
2,Disappointing,"I purchased the mini-prep processor for use in chopping small amounts of vegetables and cheese, as advertised. My husband used it to grate a small amount of parmesan and to his horror, the blade not only broke off, it hit the side of the prep bowl with enough force to go through the side of the bowl, instead of just bouncing harmlessly off the piece of cheese. When we went to replace the blade and bowl we discovered that we'd end up paying more than we originally paid for the whole unit. Under the circumstances, we've decided not to replace it. And the item was advertised as being able to grate small amounts of cheese. This is the second item by Cuisinart that we've purchased that has proven disappointing for the money invested. If you want something that will only chop vegetables, then this will work. But keep an eye on it, because if the bowl shatters, as ours did, someone might get hurt."
4,Good little machine for the price,"I recently purchased this product at the insistance of my mom. I didn't think I would use/like it much, but after trying it I have to say it's a good little machine. I don't think it would work well for a big household, but for one to two people it's great."
5,great product,I bought this product for making baby food for my daughter and I love it. It is nice and small so I can leave it on the counter and not have to put it away all the time. I also love that it is easy to take apart and put back together for easy cleaning.
5,Great seller!,"I needed a replacement for my broken ""Cuisinart DLC-1SS Mini-Prep Processor, Brushed Stainless Steel"" since we use it for the baby to mix and blend foods. The seller had send this item fast and with no problems, for which I am very thankful. I will definitely buy from this seller again in the future.This is a great and indespensible item for all who have babies, by the way.Thank you."
1,Gave 1 star because I didn't have the option of 0 stars,"I purchased this as a Christmas 2009 gift for my mother. It never worked from day one out of the box. It has never been used because it was dead on arrival. Call Cuisinart and was told that it has a 3 year limited warranty. I would have to pay $10.00 for shipping and handling on a new, unused item. That would up my puchased price by $10.00. I chose to eat the cost and never purchase Cuisinart again. And of course write a review. Terrible product and company.Cuisinart DLC-1SS Mini-Prep Processor, Brushed Stainless Steel"
1,Unpleasantly surprised,"Way too small for any sort of normal use. I had no idea how small it would be. It's more of a toy than a kitchen appliance, and better suited to a child's playtime cooking set. Flimsy plastic and waaaay overpriced at thirty-some dollars. Saw Black and Deckers of a similar size at Walmart for around ten bucks (wished I saw those first). Ahh well..."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I thought I can buy this product to simplify cooking. First task, chop onion. The manual recommends that you chop the onion into small pieces before putting it in. Interesting! Well now I'm realizing this thing is very small for an onion.Second, make a shake. Doesn't work well. Why? cuz the lid is not well designed so the liquid leaks from the top with the high speed of rotation. Other products use some elastic material in between to fill an space. This product it's plastic fitting on plastic, and definitely the liquid will spill from in between with centrifugal power. Product not tested?"
2,maybe its me,"i bought this mainly to chop onions and such to save time of chopping by hand, but no matter what i do i end up with mush and chunks of onion. i dont know what im doing wrong, if anyone has any suggestions - feel free to help me out"
3,eh,"I've been a magician for a while, and was interested in getting into manipulation effects like this one. The thing came, and i was excited. I opened the balls first, and these were amazing: pro quality, durability, just over all the perfect sponge balls. However, I was really disappointed with the dvd. The man was ok, but didnt offer what I thought was most valuable: how to do an effective fake pass. The tricks were basic, which is ok because spenge ball tricks are never hard.Pros:Excellent balls.Gives a sample routine to get you introduced to flaws.Cons:there are better trick tutorials on youtube.doesnt offer enough fine-detail level explenation, so tricks come out mediocre.Final: I love the balls, hate the video. If you can, buy just the balls from this company, and go to any free site where the tricks are just as good, explained better, for magicians who want to go somewhere with their purchase."
4,Works Great,The infared scanner is very sensitive so you have to be careful where you put it. I use it in my office. Under my desk it would open every time I moved so I had to put it elsewhere.Nice solid look.
5,Great Product,This is a very cute product. I will be giving to my son in law as he is a very big NFL fan and entertains with his friends.
3,Deep Thinking,"This book is certainly full of knowledge. It may take SOME time to get through. Interesting, though."
2,Not printed on acid-free paper,"Two stars, but only for uninspired book-making. I'm not really qualified to comment on the contents, but it is disappointing that such an apparently fine, definitive translation is not printed on acid-free paper."
3,Tibetan Book of the Dead,"The description of this book made it sound easy enough for a total novice to read. Turns out it's a lot more academic than I expected. That's not a bad thing -- it's just taking more time and effort than anticipated. If you're game for a real test of your determination to know more about this Buddhist stuff, go ahead and get it."
5,"Tibet's gift to the world, presented by Robert Thurman","This book is an atlas. It is a valuable friend that will do more than save your life, it will alter your destiny beyond life as well. It is an essential guidebook for every voyager through life, death and rebirth. Inside are complete instructions to recognize every ""in between state"" and how to use them by remembering your true nature to become liberated from the wheel of death or to choose the best rebirth, instead of unconsciously falling into a random rebirth...like we have been doing for eons.It is masterfully translated by Robert Thurman complete with insightful, inspiring, enchanting chapters on the history of Tibet and its evolution from a tribe of warrior shamans to the nonviolent peaceful people devoted to the Buddha Dharma. He tells in a very down to earth way about the Tibetans' view on life, death and rebirth. Read this book; you'll be glad you did; especially when you find yourself trying to navigate the afterlife."
3,Gleaning,"What I gleaned from this book, was that there are 3 sides to God, or 3 buddha-bodies: Reality, Resource, and Emanation.What We are to do, is purify negativities in Our lives, and renounce laziness. We are to get rid of dissonant mental states, and get rid of oppression steming from ignorance and prejudice, and end suffering when possible.We are to remember that Our ultimate essence is selfless, pure and compassionate. It is intrinsic awareness. It is stark of expectations (or unattached to out-comes). It realizes that impermanent things are unreliable, and becomes unattached to what it thinks life ""should"" be, and lives in the moment.We are to strive after virtue in body, speech and mind. We are to study, reflect, and meditate. Also, We are to seek blessings, achievement and enlightenment!Lastly, We are to be generous, joyful and happy."
1,A waste of money,"If you know how to purchase fat free products like sour cream, then you certainly don't need this very boring and uninspired cookbook."
5,Such a great film,This is my favorite movie of all time. Great cast and well written. The editing is not the best but the writing makes up for it. It is a must see if you like non Hollywood movies.
4,Worth buying!,"After their break-trough debut Külmale Maale (1989), Estonian punk band J.M.K.E. released Grindgode Kultuur (1993).I think this record is worse than the other J.M.K.E.'s records(well, it's still better than Rumal Nali), but what makes this bad is the soft sound. Also Villu Tamme is not giving his best in the vocals. Those things take away one star. The included Savist Saar EP in the CD and cassette versions is exception for the sound. Better quality, I could say.The best songs are Vras sda, Ajutine tuli, Gringode Kultuur, Valentina, Enamuse tahe, Viimane plvkond, Kuniks elul..., and the whole included EP.Other songs are average, but the clearly worst song is ""Koer"". I don't know why I dislike it.This record is worth buying, but if you're new to this band, I recommend you should buy Külmale Maale, Jäneste Invasioon or htumaa Viimased Tunnid."
4,Solid album by Cheo,"Released in 1977 under Vaya, is one I frankly had never seen or known of until yesterday. I really didn't know what to expect. Let me be the first to say that this album is an absolute delight. ""Por Mas Que Viva"" is a very good song highlighting the obvious, it doesn't matter how much you live, you're going to die (in Spanish it sounds much better.) I also found a song I liked very much,but never knew the name which was ""Nacha."" Overall the album is not a classic but, very good. Plus, a patriotic title will win me over 99% of the time."
3,"Decent, but not the best of the series.","For me, this is the book that led to the problems the Wagons West/Holts series had at the end. By no longer having one central character, they weakened the series. Janessa is a wonderful character, and deserved to have a book featuring her, but the series would have been better off in the long run focusing on Tim Holt.This novel does a wonderful job reflecting what it was like being a Cherokee in the 1890's, as well as dealing with the problems that came with malaria.Still, it is one a reader can safely pass over if need be."
4,Cherokee nation left behind.,"Like all of her books, they are an easy read, I learn something about the events of the day, and look forward to the story line and how each of the Holt line are coping with life in their day and time.The story of Janessa Holt in North Carolina is very interesting. The plight of the Cherokee nation there is enlightening. Great story.The ups and downs of bad boy Sam Brentwood are a little tiring, but do provide a great backdrop to the exciting events in Hawaii."
3,It's not GLASS,"It's gloss, it's not glass. Fooled me! It's not hideous, it's okay. Not what I was expecting."
2,Misrepresented,While this is a decent product it is misrepresented. It does NOT have a metal door bracket. It has the standard flexible door attachment. Product info. needs to be updated.
2,"split after 3 months, but was so cheap","bought this 3 months ago. they look great as in photos and dirt cheap (i believe was $10 total). but the large one just cracked straight down from one handle and moving towards the other.no idea, but buying my next one from Costco. at least the next time, i can take it back to them for a replacement."
1,Absolute junk,"Ordered a set as a gift. The larger board arrived warped, split, and with one of the handles about to fall off.I then ordered up a replacement, and the replacements were no better. They both went backHaving the name Calphalon on it; you'd think it was a quality item.Dont waste your money on this trash."
1,Warped Wood Disaster,I wish I could get my money back for these cutting boards I bought a few short months ago. The are both warping - and NO we never put them in the dishwasher or let them stand in the sink with water. I am an experienced cook and use - or should I say used - them daily. The metal handles had to be removed because they got loose very soon after we bought them (the screws no longer stay tight in the wood). Now the entire boards are so warped they will not lay flat on the counter - a real aggravation while chopping. Find another product - I'll be doing the same and wishing I had not spent the $ on these.
1,Pure Junk,This was originally a freebie bonus set with cookware. They are pure junk. They both ended up in the trash after 1 month of use. Poor handles and very poor wood. Even applied mineral oil to start but still fell apart.
3,magellan explorist 300,"I just drove up from Fresno to Sacramento and found the 300 only has major highways and absolutely no street mapping whatsover. If you are looking for a basic navigational device to get you back to the highway when you are just running around town, it will do, but to get out to the back country and hike or ride the bike with it? Probably not - there is just not enough detail, unless you just want to retrace your steps back where you came from. The maximum amount of detail is about 100 ft (scale).I am looking into the 300/400, as you get detail road maps and can download topographical data. You also get rechargable batteries and color display (400). Good luck."
4,GPS for the travel junkie,"I bought this GPS for my honeymoon trip on a cruise liner. I took it on the top decks and plotted the ship's position relative to its sailing along the eastern US Coast (we sailed from NYC to PR, and St Thomas).I was able to track our speed and course the entire time.The batteries last as long as the box says, about 12 hours straight. The screen is easy to read and the device is simple enough to use.I was impressed."
4,Megaman Network Transmission,I have enjoyed Megaman over the years. This was not your typical side scrolling Megaman. If you are looking for a change of pace try it out.
5,the best (and most annoying) game ever!,"ok, after reading the other reviws your gonna say this game [is bad]. well your WRONG! Im an extreme gamer and this game's bosses are tough. It takes a while to beat them, so if you buy this game, here's a tip for the first boss. Slide under the fire when it's about to touch you.I'm probably close to beating the game (all that i know is left is the Zero Account and the Undernet), but im probably not. ive beaten about 9 of the bosses, but i really like the game. So get off your butt and go buy the game..."
3,It's not the best choice,"Okay. This game is not the best game out of megaman, not even close actually. The people who even thought of making this game had too much of the ""lets make game so hard that no1 will ever trade it in while they were't thinkin of making it nearly as fun the battle network games for GBA. They focus on killing megaman bout 10 times before beating gutsman and wastin all ur time finding 8 chips for 1 enemy. It's noyt that bad tho. It has great graphics for a mega man game on gamecube, and you'll spend hours trying too figure out how to beat the first boss. Overall:3"
4,Whats up with low grading punks.,I dont get it. Many people this game. I freakin love it. Come on people fireman is easy. just slide when he attacks. I have to admit gutsman was really hard. I swear when he jumps he sounds like he's saying pikachu. If you think fire man is hard wait intell you see the final boss. now thats something to be mad at.
4,cool but hard game,"ok this game is really good. Its has great graphics and the chip system is pretty cool.But this game is also very very challenging. Like, if you run out of lives you have to start so far back its not even funny. Also just to let you know the Zero virus is just a new and improved Quikman from the old Megaman games.So i reccomend renting the game before buying it."
1,"annoying..............and frustrating,rpg was bad way to go!",the first level is next to impossible to beat and they keep starting you at the beginning of the level if you do not beat fireman.........plus the rpg part of the game thay should have definately left out............i do not know why they always try and change the style of the old games they should just leave them the way they are and just improove the graphics...........definately rent the game first because chances are you are going to hate it
1,horrible,this is one of the most horribile games i have ever played.It is very difficult and boring. Dont waste your time renting this game or buying it.
2,I want my money back ._.,"This game is way to hard. And wtf is up with them talking in jap? There are hardly any voice overs....wait,yep,HARDLY. The only time they talk is when you get an email,and i dont even know what the carp there're saying!There are abslutely no cut scences. I want my money back!!! ;_;"
2,Jivago 24K Body Lotion,"I got two bottles without the original boxes, no seal, and they were very dirty and dusty. I was surprised because it had said it was New."
3,"Pro Cast Sports Fishing Game, It's just okay.","I rented the game just to see if it would one that I would like to add to my collection, and I would like to buy it; however, I wished it had at least 2 player competition. Game play was easy, after you got used to it (the rented game did not have the book, so I had to figure out how to play it.) The on-line hint guide was terrible!Overall it was fun to play and did offer a degree of challenge. By the way... I am an expert fisherman."
4,"Toomer was NOT ""African American"" but European-American","Readers who call Jean Toomer ""black"" or ""African American"" are totally in error. He rejected that racist ""one drop"" classification and deserves praise and admiration for doing so. Toomer's parents and grandparents were not ""black middle class"" but looked whiter than many Americans who call themselves ""white."""
5,"A Classic, and still one of the best references for PFN's and rotary spark gaps","This edition is an unabridged softcover reprint of Volume 5 from the classic 28 Volume MIT Radiation Laboratory Series. The series was originally published in the late 1940's, and covered virtually all aspects of radar theory and development. During WWII, The Radiation Laboratory provided the bulk of the USA's research and development effort for military radar systems. This volume is a classic reference work covering high power pulse generators. It still one of the best reference works for resonant charging theory, pulse forming networks, rotary spark gaps, hard tube and line modulators, thyratrons, pulse forming networks, and pulse transformer theory, design, and testing. No serious pulsed power researcher should be without a copy of this title."
2,hole on finger,Had a hole in the middle of one of the fingers. One glove had a half-inch hole between the finger when I took it out of the bag.
1,Save your money,"Thank goodness this came on BET and I was able to see it before I purchased it. I understood the concept and what they were trying to do in this play, but it was not good at all."
3,A Play,"This was okay play, full of drama and over acting but that is what make it okay. II you like Vivica then watch it."
3,LORD ALL MEN CAN'T BE DOGS,"The play was a little silly (I think I'm going to avoid any plays that involve Vivica Fox she seems to over act alot), it was entertaining but corny"
1,This play is a HOT MESS!,"This play is not worth the money or your time!!! The play had no clear message. It was all over the place. It made the power of God seem weak to the power of the devil. The singing was even worse then the acting. You would not know that JOHNNY GILL WAS a hit recording artist. To make it plan, THIS WAS A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE PLAY! If plays like this would have come out before there was a Tyler Perry/Madea, people would not have given those wonderful plays a chance. Christian Keys needs to go back and let Tyler teach him something about writing plays, cause his writing SUCKS!!"
1,Its a movie of a stage play,"This is a video of a stage play, if you like that kind of thing. They have about three maybe four sets, and it has a TV-show style laugh track."
1,descent to mediocrity,From a great writer this book is a dampsquib. He has lost direction midway trying desperately to package in a lot of disperate subjects. Judd is a flat character who is running after a fantastic idea of living for ever. His search opens up all funny situations like Ex communist bloc plots and some Oriental mysticism mixed in. The result is a incongruous mixture which leaves a poor after-taste.
1,I'm sorry I ever read it,"Its the suckiest book I have ever read and I truly regret reading it. I read it a couple of years ago but whenever I think about it, I get a bad feeling. I guess Harold Robbins does have a way making people remember his work ;)"
2,Wouldn't recommend this book to anyone,"I'm almost finished reading this book, and i've had kind of a hard time keeping things from becoming confusing. It jumps from business meeting to business meeting, and the characters are not very interesting. Things don't flow smoothly and it is not one of those books that you just don't want to put down. If not for curiosity about how it ends, I wouldn't even finish it, as I feel like it's hard to keep pushing to the end, enduring the middle parts of it to get to the ending."
1,Terrible,This is the worst pilates DVD I have ever done. The instructor is terrible. Do not waste your money. It is obvious that there was no thought put in to this DVD.
3,First impressions OK but....,Ordered on Amazon prime. Delivered at the weekend so pretty happy with that as I did not expect delivery until Monday.Packaging was damaged on the outside but the bike itself and all its bits were fine.Assembly was easy and quick with minimal tools. Finished item looks pretty good.Here's here it went wrong. Took it for a first ride and while out the rear tire went soft... Tried pumping it but I discovered the valve is loose. It just won't hold air. The more I tried to pump it the worse it got. I need to get a valve tightener now as I don't have one. I will update this once I have the bike for a while but this tire issue with a brand new bike seems kinda lame.
4,What ya talkin bout?,"Man, dude above me. u shudnt diss auto modelista jus cos it was crap on the previous consoles. im british and all of us who live here cant get games as soon as you can and u shud b greatful like deux ex is cummin out in feb! and u got it now!!!!!!!!!!! think! right, now..... this game lookes quite gud and shud b a great game thank u ladies and gents. bye bye 4 now."
4,"Nice performances, but hard to listen to","This is a very rousing and well-performed version of these medival dance tunes. The arrangements are very free, and often new instrumental lines are improvised around the monophonic melodies preserved in the manuscripts. The performances upon bagpipes, bombards, and shawms are especially rousing, especially the -Saltarello I-.But there is a problem. There is a substantially greater variance of recording level through these pieces than seems customary. I realize, of course, that bombards and bagpipes are loud and should sound loud, while recorders and plucked strings are soft. The range, though, makes this a hard record to listen to. After listening at a comfortable level to the first track with loud instruments, you will need to turn it way up to hear the soft tracks that follow; and if you don't catch it, you will be blown out of your seat when the bagpipes and bombards return."
2,"It works. But, not as intended...","I use this fairly regularly, yet I do not have washboard abs. This machine does not seem to target the abdominals at all. However, it absolutely blasts your triceps. In fact, it does this so well that I now have muscle definition in that area that I've never had before. So, if you need an abdominal machine, look elsewhere. If you received this as a gift, or can find it at a garage sale for a couple of bucks - - it's great for an upper arm/shoulder workout. (Go figure...)"
1,"Useless machine, don't waste your time and money","Traditional ab crunches are best.If you are not somebody who exercises everyday,you will definitely sprain your back and very difficult to use it. If I could, I would give this machine negative star. like I said, don't waste your money"
2,Not easy,"This product is okay , if you do the exercises the correct way AND slowly. I tend to rush a bit and it can hurt my back sometimes. Definitly wont recommend for anyone with back problems. Another dust catcher for me."
1,I returned it right away!!,"This was a huge disappointment. The photos were sometimes absolutely grotesque (I'm a professional not of her stature but I do have an eye for this stuff!) and I had to change pages as fast as possible! Some were blurry, repetititve and made you question not only why was it in the book, but why take it at all? Nudity CAN be beautiful if done tastefully but this was just bad. NO better word would describe the content. I returned it the minute the stores opened after Christmas!I bought books I could actually learn something from..........."
1,A Celebration of Ugly and I Don't Care,"This book is perfect for today's society and culture.Page after page I couldn't help thinking that Ms. Liebowitz was getting back at everyone because God made her so unattractive. It seems it runs in the family -- the photo of her sisters would frighten a scarecrow. Her parents look like fools, the photos of Sontag are disrespectful, and even Brad Pitt is at his worst. Ugly, ugly, ugly...Yes the world is cruel and not everyone nor everything can be beautiful... it is merely that this book is blatantly defensive."
2,Well ... is exactly like the title says ...,"... no more no less.Do not expect to see more than an ""allowed invasion"" on her life in B&W.;Self promotion, just it. But who didn't, right?If you can take some lessons ""through her personal eyes"", good for you.I believe from everything you can take something good."
5,Almost as good as the real thing,"I got the book and it is excellent. I would recommend it to anyone interested in photography, celebrities, art, or Leibovitz. The only thing better than the book was the exhibition. If you live in Brooklyn, you just missed it."
2,Shoot t the graphic design team,"After seeing the exhibition (which was fantastic) the book was a sad let down for me and I returned it. Photos were cropped detroying the ambiance or the layout Leibovitz captured and aparently intended in her prints - photos were designed across a spread in such a way as interfered with the photo's integrity (one photo in particular has the page split running through the subject of the photo!). The personal photos of Sonatag in the show were very small and suggested a particular delicacy and intimacy which was lost in the book due to the relative sizing of those prints with all the others. It is a poor accompaniment to an excellent and important show of her work. If you never saw the show - you could propably let it slide - after seeing the show myself, I prefer not to have my memory tainted by an inferior product serving as representation."
3,Pictures of fame and family,"This book, as the title might imply to you, is about Leibovitz' life from 1990 to 2005. This does not mean though, that the book is limited to that. The focus shifts back and forth between her personal life and her career. The pictures are all large and vibrant. Many of them span a left and right page. There are some good portraits in here of: The White Stripes, Juliane Moore, Bruce Springsteen, Al Pacino & Robert DeNiro, Jack Nicholson, and a lot of others too. There were a lot of portraits. Then breaking up sections of these portraits were sections of pictures taken in and of her own life including funerals, vacations, and childbirth. I personally was more interested in the portraits though. Those of you who are more along my lines of just wanting to see portraits, American Music is probably more of what you want. I'm waiting for mine now."
2,Annie Liebowitz' photography book,"What a waste of my money... the entire book is of her and her family, and not the type of book I expected it too be. Its filled with lots of self expression naked photos of her that are not attractive even as art work.If I could I would send it back for a refund."
2,Bland and boring,"I don't really know any of the author's work. This was my first exposure to her and I had a hard time seeing what is so great about it. 3/4 of the book is full of b/w pictures of people lounging around at their worst. Anyone could have taken many of the pictures.There are some decent portraits but nothing that you can't find in three dozen other books from a lot of authors.I have heard her referred to as the greatest American photographer of the 20th century, maybe there are things she did a long time ago somewhere that prove it but this book just can't be a showcase of why she is so great..."
3,So So....,"I was disappointed that there were so many pictures of the photographer and her family versus ""famous"" people. But... Perhaps I should have taken to heart the title of the book, A Photographer's Life! My bad!"
2,great if you're her cousin...,"she is one of the great portrait photographers. her work is intelligent and her images approach iconic in status. that said, this book is not what you want to see. it is primarily about her private life and the photos just are not interesting unless perhaps you're her cousin or something. any of her other books blow this one away and wll contain the amazing work you associate with her name. this should have been entitled: ""300 boring pictures of susan sontag"". should be remaindered in a couple of months. save your money."
1,An Establishment Hack,Annie Lebowitz was what was happening in photography twenty or thirty years ago. Now she is a pseudo establishment hack (see her recent collaberation with Disney if you doubt this).She is paid to produce commercial photos with an Annie Lebowitz patina which apparently still has some commercial cache with Vogue and other dying retail print platforms.This collection of photos have a emotional range that starts with the incredibly self-indulgent and tapers off into her now hackneyed commercial style.If you want to see some photography with artistic integrity I would suggest a copy of Apeture.
3,More than a family document?,"It is perhaps fair to start by saying that the type of photography done by Ms Leibovitz has never been a favourite of mine. When I ordered this book I thought I might change my opinion. It was not to be. The book is basically a document of a 15 -year period in the life of Ms Leibovitz or a love story document for that matter. Actually, several love stories unfold while we browse through it.As to the pictures I have mixed feelings. There are some very good portraits. For instance, the strong portrait of iconic figure Patti Smith or Merce Cunningham's. On the other hand we have the portrait of Scarlett Johansson,who looks awful posing in a rather awkward position.No doubt Ms Leibovitz included the material she felt she had to. This notwithstanding, I think I will prefer to remember Ms Sontag as the rather physically attractive woman she was instead of thinking about her as a patient in a hospital bed or lying dead."
1,Disappointed after all,"I was very excited to win this book as a prize for a photo contest tied to the Annie Liebowitz exhibit in SF, CA. My photo was related to families. I acknowledge the other reviewers. The graphic layout of the photos reduced the value of her beautiful work. This book is important. It's production should have accorded it the same treatment. Who was in charge of its publication? Was Annie consulted? I can't imagine it. Actually it would make me feel better to think that she wasn't included in the approval cycle; how could you do this to yourself?"
5,"Revealing, interesting, and impressive","Leibovitz reveals a lot about herself in this massive volume. I was expecially taken with the Susan Sontag photos: in good health, sick, and finally dead. Her opening essay gives insight into how this book was constructed and explains the logic for the order.This is more than a coffee-table book and I can guarantee you will go through it many times as I did."
5,beautifully done,This compilation of work by Annie Leibovitz is magnificent. The stories are told by the pictures alone. Wonderful purchase.
5,A Photographer's Life,"It is a great book, of exceptional quality. I gave it as a gift & the recipient was overwhelmed, as she is a fan of Lebovitz's work & is in college studying photography!"
2,Not that great a family photo album,"As a somewhat serious hobbyist photographer, I suspected, when I read the negative ""family photo album"" review, that that person was insensitive to such qualities as fine composition that might distinguish these photos. Leibovitz is a great photographer. I decided to look at the book before purchasing such an expensive book. There is, I am afraid, some merit in the negative comments. Many of the personal life photos do in fact come across as snapshots of no particular distinction. Obviously these photos have great personal meaning for Leibovitz. Some of the reviewers seem to be able to emphathize with that meaning. Perhaps these photos will help some feel better about the quality of their own family snapshots. I would advise people to examine this book before buying, as I did. I chose not to invest in it."
5,Susan Conant writes another winner,"This book about Sherlock Holmes, animal communcation, pet therapy and, of course, dogs, is another winner by Susan Conant. I highly recommend it!"
3,OK book,"a little hard to get into but all in all it is ok not her best effort, however. I usually love all her books."
4,Sherlock Holmes and dogs,"I love this series so much because of the dogs, and so this particular book was even more fun with all the allusions to Sherlock Holmes. I too am a big Sherlock Holmes fan, so really enjoyed this book as Holly works her way through a mystery that is very eerily familiar to Sherlock Holmes stories. In this book Holly also inherits a cat, so it's interesting to see how a dog lover learns to cope with a cat. And this cat is not making it easy for Holly to make friends. These books are a lot of fun, and I enjoy each and every one."
2,one I never reread,"I'm sure sherlock holmes fans will love it. But if you read this series for the dog trivia, what you get in this one is tons of Holmes trivia. If you know nothing about Sherlock Holmes, you'll be bored through most of it. Either Conant was getting bored with dogs, or she decided to try and garner more readers through a little expansion. The ploy didn't work well with me. I also found the new characters in this book, Althea and Cici, tiresome and wordy. More dogs, please. Stay with dog clubs or an obedience trial and leave Holmes to non dog mysteries."
1,A waste of your hard earned money,We bought this for my daughter. I really doesn't work well at all. It doesn't keep the hair twisted together even when you put the beads and elastics in that come with it. Don't buy one...
1,DISAPPOINTED,I DID NOT CARE FOR THIS PRODUCT AT ALL. MY SISTER A COSMETOLOGIST WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE ONE I BOUGHT HER EITHER.
5,"David Byrne, pop star","Heavily fractured through a prism of art school irony and minimalism, all David Byrne ever really wanted to be was a pop star, a status he would only (semi-)attain a decade later when he slapped on the Big Suit. But, way back in '77, with a nod to pop instrumentalist Sergio Mendes, this album was the frankest manifesto of that aspiration. Its incredibly catchy songs defy you not to sing along in your own full-throated, geeky-gawky glory after about the second listen. If you think I'm a bit far-fetched, watch Byrne's only outing as a film director, True Stories, in which the common folk of Virgil, Texas, the General Public that Byrne is gently ribbing, nevertheless manage to gather for a night of karaoke and belt out.... a Talking Heads rocker. Even now, 30 years later, I still know all the words. Even then, Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth were beginning their three-LP run as the greatest rhythm section of rock's post-punk era."
5,Flawless...,Annie's name is the namecard of Medusa. MEDUSA has never been so deluxe like in this double-disc edition. I can feel that the original sounds have been remastered and the bonus live disc is worth the wait and the price at the same time. It proves the talent and inner power of this GRAMMY/BRIT-AWARD/GOLDEN GLOBE/ACADEMY AWARD winner.
5,"Muy bueno, sobre todo el segundo cd","Esta de mas hablar de la excelente voz de annie, sin embargo el escucharla en vivo aumenta aun mas mi fanatismo por ella. Le doy 5 estrellas especialmente por las excelentes versiones de sus mas antiguos temas como integrante de Eurythmics."
1,Never will buy again...,"I bought this for my almost 5 year old son, even though it's rated at 6+. Instructions for assembly were ok except that the pieces did not fit together well or securely. Very many times during building, one part would knock off another part even when I did it. Once we got it put together we could not play with it at all without multiple pieces falling off. This is the second Mega Block set that I have purchased with the very same results. Sorry that I bought it and I won't purchase a Mega Block set like this again."
2,spot humidity,"Once installed the Fish Finder had a humidity spot in the screen. after 7-8 hours disappeared, but I am nervous that happens again.Other problem, maybe by my fault, it is not possible to convert to metrics, (unbelievable at this time)""quick-disconnect mounting system"" jajaja...I am not happy with this fish finder. My last Garmin 100 (discontinued) was very good."
2,3 years had enough,Ive been using my 525 for 3 years in the ocean on a 15 ft Boston Whaler in NJ. I have had the same internal fogging problem on the screen - also the unit works about 50% of the time. I have to turn it off and on all the time then it says 3 feet in the middle of the ocean and usually only powering off and on helps. Sometimes it gets stuck on 3 feet while I am driving and sometimes while I am drifting. There is no pattern and it has done this for 3 years so I am looking at Garmins for next summer.Also I contacted Humminbird via email and they were no help. They sent a list of 20 things that might cause this but no real answer.
4,exactly right,"Product arrived quickly, no hassles, and fit its application perfectly. Product was exactly what I expected based on the advertisement. No problems at all."
2,Disapointed with this Watch,"I brought this for my Husband and I was very disapointed with it once I actually saw it in person, it looks cheap, the bracelet is very hard to re-size and the buttons on the sides are very tender to the touch, over all if you want a nice watch I would not advise getting this one."
2,It's a watch - but a poor one,"About all I can say about this product is, ""it's a watch"".Other than that it is cheap, as in cheaply made. Ok, so at this price what do you expect? It's below the line though... snarfy metal and unpredicatable closure and buttons make it not even worth that price.By the way, I bought two thinking they were a good deal... not.Stay with something like the casio or timex."
4,Easy to Read and Great Lookimg,"I would give this a 5 Star except that it is a bit thicker than I like but everything else is great. The band is large but it has 5 adjustments to easily make smaller. It looks alot more expensive, can't belive that they are selling it for $7.95."
4,wonderful,it's a high value product with such a low price...and it works very well..my friends also like it and they didn't believe the price is true..
3,"Watch OK, Band is not","I got this watch several years ago. It loses a few seconds/day, which I can live with. But the band is too big (I'm 6', 185#). I took it to the jeweler but he said you can't remove links. So it's been a constant annoyance -- I have to put it high up on my arm and it continually slips down, especially when the weather is dry. Someone else commented that the buttons get pushed in normal wear -- this is also true, but the issue with the band is a much more constant annoyance.PS: This is a friend's account -- she is _not_ 6' 185#."
2,tiny!,"This locket is absolutely tiny, nearly invisible and couldn't possibly accommodate a photo, at least not a photo anyone could see."
3,can't really rate product just the service,"I purchased this for my daughter-n-law for her birthday. Fortunately I talked to her about it. I found out none of the assesories had been included. After corresponding with Dealtaker, I was told amazon had the description wrong. I had her return it with Dealtakers paying return postage. I then ordered her a different one that arrived as described. I don't know who was in the wrong. If I hadn't discussed it with her I would have never known that she didn't receive what I wanted her to have. Dealtakers handled the problem in a timely fashion. The replacement I ordered from Dealtakers thru amazon also. I just checked and it is nolonger available on Amazon so I don't know why I'm writing this review"
1,The Vac seal unit is good but the canister is crap,Do not buy any of their canisters etc. They crack after few weeks of use. They would not honor their warranty. I am speach impaired and they told me to call a phone number. I told them I can't talk they said find someone who could. That is a violation of the Handy access laws. It's not bad enough I got shot in the face and disabled these Jerks are taking advantage of it. I will not buy another of their products
3,Good sealer for occasional use,"I would have liked the machine to be a little bit heavier, it tends to slide back when I am trying to line the bag up. Also, the lid falls down on my hands alot. It seals great, but it takes a little finesse to manuever."
1,Misleadeing add!,"This was advertised as a ""kit"",WRONG!It came with JUST the machine...NOTThe jar sealer...NOT...The WINE sealer...NOT...The CANISTER!!As IT was advertised.When I contacted DEALYARD...They advised they DO NOT ""ship"" accessories....WTF????This was PROMISED in the ADD!!!I chose this product for the ""accessories""""GREAT"" deal for MY hard EARNED money!And ""THEY"" failed to PROVIDE!""THEY"" said they'd ""REFUND""but why not ""GIVE"" what is intailed in ""THEIR"" add?A VERY diappointed housewife...."
5,From A Woman's p.ov during South African Apartheid,"This book provides different accounts on the difficulty of being a woman during Apartheid. Many of the stories are of African women who served as servants (very low paying and often demeaning work) to the white families living in a South African society under Apartheid. A few chapters describe the difficulty of being a white woman as well, being treated as second class citizens from their husbands and men. Racial predjudice is the underlying theme and the struggle just to survive day to day life is described in great detail. Children are also represented in this book, the African children's lives were often no better then their parents. This book is easy to read and is a great way to learn more about society during Apartheid."
1,Knife broke the first day I received it!,"I just received this knife yesterday & am sending it back for a refund. Upon first use, the forked metal tip broke off when I was chopping tomatoes for a salad. It took me a few moments to notice the lost tip (as it had ended up in the salad I was preparing.) Could have been very dangerous to swallow a sharp metal tip! The knife itself is flimsy, can't imagine that it could cut a bagel very well."
1,Bagel Knife inadequate,"I bought this knife, and was thrilled to find that it was etched on the end for easy identification (I so frequently mistakenly identify my knives), but I was very disappointed to find that it in fact was unable to cut my bagels.All I was able to cut with this knife were doughnuts (specifically, old-fashioned - jelly doughnuts, as everyone knows, must be cut using a cheese grater held at a 29.5 degree angle).My recommendation? unless you have an abundance of old-fashioned doughnuts to cut you'd be better off buying a seagull knife. Unfortunately, most seagull knives are not notched, so you may find yourself inadvertently selecting a bowie knife, but either will be better at cutting bagels than this atrocity."
2,difficult to use,"This is very difficult to use - not ready out of the box - need to probably get other cords, etc. to connect to computer/speakers - more complicated than I was lead to believe"
5,Great Pillow,"I bought this pillow for reading in bed. My daughter loved it so much that I ended up giving it to her. It is just firm enough to prop yourself up for reading, however, she also uses it for sleeping."
1,Terrible quality,"I bought this project hoping my GSD mix and my GSD would play tug of war with it. Instead, my German Shepherd completely destroyed it within 30 minutes of me throwing it to him. He completely destroyed the balls within 10 minutes (chewing them to pieces) and then proceeded to unwind and eat the rope. I ended up taking it from him and throwing it away."
3,Better,"This one is better than her first attempt to do it all alone. The production is more even, the songs are better in quality. ""Santa Maria"" is a nice catchy track by Stock Aitken Waterman (but flopped before already with the singer ""Tatjana""). Remixes of ""Perhaps"" and ""Let me free"" work, but ""Just a dream"" stays as shallow as on ""21st Century Fox""....anyway, it's always good to see an artist who tries it by herself."
4,Oh my gosh do not get this game for your sake and mine.,"Really where to begin with this horrid game... Oh, yes. First and foremost is the very very repetitive gameplay. Shoot robots, repeat. Then there was the issue of going through the same old gray hallway. I mean come there are only like three pathetic hallway types. One of the biggest problems is that you can't run and freakin' shoot! Whose idea was that anyways!? I'm shootin' one 'bot with my lasers standing still and we're just moronicly standing still shooting one another. I was very anxious to get my hands on this game, and as it turns out it sucks! Well I guess its time to add another game to the bargain bin."
3,BP 662 I rate as fair. I have better scissors.,BP 662 I rate as fair. I have better scissors.But they were not expensive.
3,"Great dancing, awful DVD quality","I have this performance on a Kultur VHS, and I absolutely love it. I was very excited when a DVD version came out, and immediately bought it. But ... this DVD is just awful. In the VHS the first act scenery has fall colors, the prince has a deep dark blue costume. This DVD shows everything in various shades of grey and brown. On the VHS second act had dark blue background with willis in shimmery white dresses. On DVD the background is dark grey, and the willis are dull white. Sound quality is even worse than on the VHS. I love the performance, but until a better DVD version comes out I'll watch the 15 year-old VHS."
1,Really poor,"I should have read the other reviews before I bought this. Horrible sound and poor picture quality. Very fine dancing, but I haven't been able to watch it through to the end, the production values are so poor.This is not a ""real"" performance from the stage of the Bolshoi. Rather, this was filmed (taped?) on a sound stage rather than in a theatre. I assumed I would be getting a ""real"" performance from the Bolshoi.All-in-all, avoid this"
1,Appalling DVD release of a great performance,"The present DVD release of this historical film, highlighting two great Bolshoi dancers Natalya Bessmertnova and Mikhail Lavrovsky at their peak, is a gross insult. The producers of this hideosity have succeeded in proving the unthinkable: DVD can after all be far worse than VHS - in sound as well as in image.To be avoided at all costs."
2,Competent but dull,"I pretty much agree with everyone else here, though I admit I am curious as to the color wash-out on DVD, I can readily understand how the VHS might be more enjoyable if the visuals are more strikingly transferred. The sound transfer is not very good, not horrible, but the very first chords are attenuated and it sounds like someone upped the volume than and was too lazy to do it over. It is filmed on a huge stage, so the dancers are given lots of room to strut their stuff, but a filming of a live performance might have been, well, livlier. There is an emotional flatness about the whole endeavor, though Act Two emerges more effectively in that regard than Act One. The score is cut rather significantly, yup those peasants are gone in Act One.If you want a GISELLE at a budget, this isn't the world's worst choice, but I'd save a few pennies and go elsewhere."
1,Rip Off!,"Lets not sugar coat this. Right now this version is a greatest hit on PS2 selling for $19.99. How can you just change the name, add a few ""extras"", change the name and turn around and sell it for $49.99. Its a rip off, a con, or even a flim flam. This is the last time I buy a game based on the name alone. The gameplay is still slow. The graphics are not XBox quality. The sound effects are horrible. This is a huge waste of money. In closing, if I could give this game negative stars I would."
1,So here's the thing.,"I love the Tenchu games. I'll say now, I am biased in favor of these games, like, a lot. This one is my absolute favorite, for the PS2, and that's the thing; On the PS2, you can actually play this game. The control scheme for this game simply isn't friendly to the xbox controller, so the whole game feels clunky and awkward."
2,"Neat concepts, but could've been better..","First off, why do you morons review something before it is out? What a disservice to have to read! This game should have borrowed heavily from splinter cell, I think any hardcore fan of stealth games would agree. I found the camera adjustments frustrating and some of the AI to be laughable. The only part that I liked was the stealth attacks. I have yet to find a game ported from ps2 to xbox that has been done well, with the exception of Grand Theft Auto."
2,(...)out of $50 dollars!!!,"RETURN FROM DARKNESS on X-Box is nothing but a Playstation 2 version of WRATH OF HEAVEN. As far as I am concerned, Activision deceptively left out information about the game and changed the name to make Tenchu followers believe that it was something different. WRATH OF HEAVEN was cool, but you dont need to have a On-Line Multiplayer mode to enjoy the game. After I completed WRATH OF HEAVEN, I could'nt wait for the next Tenchu game. After being tricked into buying RETURN FROM DARKNESS, I dont care what comes out next, I will never buy another Tenchu game again."
2,"A step above ""For Dummies"", but not much...","I found this book to a lot of hype and not much delivery. In Chapter 6, the authors spend two whole pages on how to add graphics to Microsoft Word. This is one of the main reasons one would choose Visio. They list the options one may select, but never actually tell you how to accomplish the act!! The index in the back is also difficult to use, hard to find the topics one is looking for - or this may actually be a reflection of the book being incomplete. I have learned more about Visio on my own than by reading, using, or attempting to look up a reference in Hedtke & Knottingham's ""Official"" guide."
2,Fine for beginners,"This book is OK for beginners who have little to no experience with other graphics programes (i.e. Publisher, Illustrator), but it simply glosses the more advanced features. For example, the books states, almost like an ad, that you can link to Access and Project, but gives useless explanations as to how these tasks are done and no examples or explanation on why you would do it. These advanced features are the very reason you would use Visio in the first place."
1,I can't play it,"I know this is Xbox rather than Xbox 360 gameBut I still bought it because I thought it is a great game so Microsoft would offer the update version so I can play in my Xbox 360, you know that right? Lots of games can be player in 360 even if they are just XboxI was wrong..."
2,Camera Crisis 3,"To put it simple: this is five star action/horror game that is drastically degraded by the worst camera system I have ever seen in my life. The camera systems should never be the most challenging part in a game. lol. I died more times from the silly camera than anything else. If you believe you can get over the flawed camera system in the game, this game is for you. I highly suggest watching some videos on youtube of gameplay so you get an idea what the camera system is like. I seriously almost stopped playing the game due to the frustration, but I'm a pretty hardcore gamer. So I sucked it up and fought my way to the end. In conclusion, if you are easily frustrated by terrible camera systems this game is not for you, but if you love for action/horror, space, or dinosaurs is greater than your hatred for bad camera systems this game is for you."
1,another dinosour crisis,"Ok bottom line,worst game ever. nice graphics but blended with boring gameplay,bad mix.Some of the puzzles are fun in their own stupid way.but other than that, this crisis can only be salveged as another whipty ding dong button masher(and thats putting it so mild its funny!)so take this from me steer clear of this abomination because the way this thing plays I wouid dare not to think this game was created and made in the prehistoric days!!!!!!!!"
3,OK BUT JUST OK,DINO CRISIS 3 WAS OK THE STORY WAS GOOD THE GRAPICS PERFECT CAMERA ANGLES SUCKED YOU COULD NOT SEE WHAT WAS ATTACKING AND WHORSE IF YOU HAD TO JUMP ONTO A PLATFORM THE CAMERA ANGLE WOULD CHANGE CAUESING YOU TO FALL
4,me again,"I personly think that the camara angles aren't that bad, yes they can be frusterating when your fighting a boss and you cant see it. But it adds suspence not seeing what your shooting. And the game has an auto aim so if your shooting an enemy off screen you'll still be hiting it."
1,Capcom's first real flop. :(,"I have played DC, DC2, and DC3. The first 2 games were great, but DC3 is the worst Capcom title ever. My main reason for this is the horrable camra angles, most of the time you are forced to shoot off screen. Sometimes right in the middle of a fight the CA will change several times head aches are common. To top that off the story line makes no sense at all. This is very disappointing as I am a die hard Capcom fan. I hope that they would remake DC3 for Xbox 360 or PS3 because if they don't this is a sad ending to the first two great games... all it did was leave most people confused and upset."
5,This game is wonderful!,"I've been hearing a lot of folks talk about how horrid thecamera angles are. DO NOT expect the same out of this gameas a 3rd person game!! Once I accepted this game for what itwas, I began to realize this game is refreshingly different andhad a TON of fun! The graphics are amazing and the cut scenesare top quality and VERY entertaining. I did, however, takeissue to the direction they went with the surviver in the story-line. In the end I was sad that the game was over. Hats off toCapcom! I really hope the franchise stays alive and maintainsthis level of excellence."
1,"3,2,1... Throw Controller!","Something bad happened during playtesting for this title. To be precise, it seems like nobody was playtesting it. A 3rd person camera flicks maddeningly from one bad location to another, constantly leaving your enemies off-camera, making dodging and aiming (not to mention *crate jumping puzzles!*) a complete and utter joke. No surprise the original Dino Crisis development team had nothing to do with this visually beautiful yet disastrous title (Yes, the spaceship is beautiful).To say the gameplay is bad would be doing a disservice: it just doesn't WORK.A big WT_? for Capcom on this unfinished bow-wow."
4,Very good game,"I have played a demo of this game and it was really good, there are new dinosaurs, amazing weapons and whole type of controlling system. As you progress through the game the whole ship changes around new walls open and everything that was closed is open. And there are new scarier types of dinosaurs. You are equiped with 2 hyper boosters so you have the ability to kind of fly around with the freedom of any kind of movement such as side to side moing etc. The only reason I rated this game a four is because it doesn't have anything to do with the Regina, Dylan and Paula storyline. If you are looking for a true sequal to dino crisis 2 you should buy Dino Stalker which involves 2 old charachters and one new one. Overall this is a really good game."
4,Somewhat,"This game has great graphics and gameplay . The new dinos look cool and the whole idea of them in space is awsome but The camera kills the whole game , its the worst camera ever . If you can deal with the camera then pick this game up if you want action ... also you cant see the enemies half the time. DC3 should have been so much better.."
3,Great graphics! Really bad camera angles,"As a game, it's really good. Awesome opening sequence, and the cut-scenes are top notch. The only real problem I have with this game, which is a big problem, is the camera angles. Half of the time you can't see what's in front of you. Totally unlike real life. Difficult to make any jumps when the camera angle keeps changing in mid jump. Instead of paying attention to the game, I payed more attention to getting around the camera bug. It's hard to immerse yourself in a game when the whole time your complaining about not seeing what's in front of you..."
5,nice little book,"I bought this book for myself and a few for gifts. It made me cry while reading it. It is so true--it is not about who wins the race, but about how you run it."
2,Last of the Aliens Series,"And no wonder. This book is probably to blame for the lack of anymore Aliens novels to be written. Out of all of the Aliens vs. Predator & Aliens novels this one was the worst.Music of the Spears has the concept of a composer on the brink of insanity that needs the screams of a live alien to complete his latest masterpiece, however,It by far goes into too much detail in areas that have no impact on the story. The characters are bland and uninteresting with too many paragraphs, if not chapters, being devoted to bringing us into the minds of these characters.Stay away from this stinker unless you have a case of insomnia as I've found myself falling asleep while reading it."
4,Best general history of the Maurya empire,"This basic general history of the first great empire of India was first published in 1961. The 1997 edition is updated primarily with a lengthly 'Afterword' that reviews all the significant new findings of the past three decades. I was introduced to the book in a graduate seminar on Mauryan art history at UCLA. The author is an acknowledged expert on Asoka and the Maurya dynasty, and this is an excellent, solid resource that includes (as an appendix) the full texts of the Asokan edicts. I have not given it 5 stars only because I believe it should have a glossary, and the footnotes often include abbreviations that are never explained. One needs at least some background in Indian history. This is not an introductory text."
5,Wonderful Children's Book!,"Yet another jewel by Debby Anderson! We love this book about God's precious relationship with children. What a wonderful introduction for young ones to the character and love of God. Such an exciting message for children, to know that a great big God knows them by name! The illustrations are adorable, too! Our family recommends all of Ms. Anderson's books!"
3,Not practical,"The plates are very stylish and trendy but they are not very practical. The smaller salad plates don't fit squarely (no pun intended) on top of the dinner plates. I recently had a dinner party and though my guests were impressed by the stylish table setting (and my shrimp creole :), the clanking of the salad plates on top of the dinner plates got to be very annoying. Also, the dinner plates are so large that they don't rotate in my microwave."
1,Not the kind of landscape design book I expected.,"This book has plenty of ideas for backyards, but they're all sketches, not photographs. Plus, you have to order the blueprints to find out what plants they're talking about in the book. This book was not very helpful."
1,"seems great, but it is junk","It looks like a great sharpener for the classroom, but I have gone through 2 in year. The only reason they are ""school pro"" is because the have a big bin and 3 sizes of holes. Inside there is a metal gear that grinds against a plastic gear and it tears it to pieces within months. Not worth the money at all."
5,Very good and helpful,"I bought this book and went to a fashion show at Bloomingdale's being led by the author, and felt very enlightened. I was unaware of the great options I had for my body type, and Sue even helped me find some wonderful things on sale. Girls...if you are size 14 and up (I'm buying size 22) you have to get this book, and if you can, catch one Nanfeldt's fashion shows"
2,Very positive - not terribly original,"The positive tone of this book should be of great value to many BBWs, though the fashion recommendations, which tend towards the conservative, are not likely to appeal to those whose tastes are more Paris than Board Room."
3,not too bad.,"had good tips, but seems a little old fashioned. (Published in 1996). Still useful, but don't look at the styles or you will be a bit behind the times...at least untill the styles come back into popularity."
5,Get Some Self-Esteem Back!,"I love this book! It is well organized and practical, making it easy to refer back to just the info you need. There are lots of visual helps, including photos of lovely plus size models of a variety of ages and skin tones. The book guides you to establish your own personal style with confidence. Best of all, this book is an upbeat celebration of women as we really are, encouraging us to be proud of our strength and beauty. After reading this book, I felt motivated to put my best foot forward NOW, not someday when I'm thinner. I approach shopping for clothes and accessories with confidence and a clear goal. Thanks, Suzan! I couldn't have done it without you!"
3,Good tool but sloppy assembly,"iI ordered this tool because of the ""sleekness of the design"". The tool does not close properly and won't fit in its case. Try again."
2,Too small for a serious tool,"I have a Wave multitool and bought this for a friend. When it arrived I realised it was considerably smaller than the one I have. The tool is well made, but the blades and pliers are small for anything serious. It has a corckscrew though...."
4,"A Bit Heavy, A Lot Handy","I wanted this pocket knife for the pliers + corkscrew + scissors + wire strippers, and all these function great. The tool is a bit on the heavy side, but that's expected with a pocket knife with so many options."
3,"Great construction, but poorly packaged","Overall, the Leatherman is an excellently constructed tool. Unfortunately, after pulling it out of the box I noticed it has a decent size scratch on it.There were some small nicks on one side of the pliers near the serrated edges as well.If not for the defects I would have certainly given 5 stars."
4,Great little tool,"I owned one of these for about 3-4 months and I lost it. I did not have one for about 2 months and finally went shopping online and narrowed it down to this one again. I never owned a different multitool so I can't accurately compare, but this one is all I expected and more."
4,LEATHERMAN XE6 - GREAT GADGET,"I have used Leatherman products for many years and have noticed the drop in quality with the later models which are produced more 'cost effectively'. I recently bought a CS-4, and promptly sent it back as the Anvil would not close back into position properly. This clearly was a design problem and not just a manufacturing one.I needed a bottle opener attachement, and having had an earlier Leatherman with one about 10 years ago, I was hoping for something as good. The XE6 has lots more atachments and is reasonably made and designed (unlike the CS-4) and fits the bill. I like the optional soft case that you can buy too - although I feel this should be included in purchase.But still, I sure wish I could buy that 10 year old model again with fewer gadgets, but better quality!"
4,"Quite nice, but missed opportunities","I like it -- a lot -- but the company missed some very easy opportunities. E.g., either, or both, of the straight edges on the handles (when extended) should have had inch/cm markings. Obvious, and no apparent reason why markings weren't included. Also: tweezers would've been nice, and easy to include. And lots of other features. That said, great hand feel -- solid weight and heft -- and useful. But this could have been the ultimate pocket multi-tool."
4,"a little flimsy, but powerful","I lost the first one of these that I bought, but had to get another... they are amazing tools for the size. I love the juicer series for the bottle opening capabilities, but the basics of a couple of very very sharp knives, scissors, screwdrivers and pliers are the valuable utility of the tool.The tool, in general, can't handle a lot of torque on the plier pivot point. I irreversibly bent my first set trying to twist something with the pliers. The only philips head is small enough to do some computer screws, but too big for most of them... would prefer a smaller one. Never have a need for the needle or file either... other options would be better."
1,Disappointment,I have always heard good things about Leatherman and my last multitool was greatHowever I have already had to return my multitool for repair after only 2 weeks! and won't get it back for a month!I think the quality of their multitools has gone downhill
4,Nothing's as good as the original,"After collecting a number of knock-offs as promotional items as various shows, etc., I bought my wife the real deal to keep in the car. Very nice."
4,Nice - but not purple,"Yet another wonder from Leatherman - I'd give it 5 stars for quality and functionality, but I have to take away a star for the color.It is more pink than purple."
4,Excellent paring knife,"I have the 8"" Chef's knife from this collection and I'm quite enamored of it: good heft and balance, exquisitely sharp, easily honed, etc. I purchased this paring knife to go with it and I am quite satisfied. Originally, I gave four stars because I found the balance off; working with the knife has convinced me that it has a perfect balance and hand feel. I would change the rating to five stars if I could figure out how. If you want a good paring knife that will last you for the rest of your life, look no farther. The steel is the same top-quality German stainless used in Solingen knives, but the knife is manufactured in China. Best of both worlds!"
1,"Got burned, literally","I purchased it, then read the instructions carefully before using it. I followed the instructions, but still got burned from the condensed steam that flowed from the end. I returned it immediately."
1,"Bought it for over a year, sit in the corner for 12 months","I bought this last year, and thought that it might work wonders, but turned out that I have to use the traditional iron again. It is not easy to iron the collar and the sleeves. Only good for something like a large piece of cloth maybe. Don't recommend it to anyone. Just wonder why it is not discontinued."
4,Worth The Money!,"I purchased this steamer early last spring and used it almost every day since. Since I wear linen every day during the spring and summer, the Rowenta came in handy. It heats fast, has a strong spray of steam and can be used on the most sensitive garments. The only drawback for me was the swivel pole. I think I would prefer that it have the option of being higher. It also took me a while to adjust to the rotation of the pole. All-in-all, it's still worth the purchase. Since I use it so often, only time will tell how long it continues to operate. But then, I'd just buy another one."
1,Returned to the store,"I had high hopes for this steamer after reading the many reviews, however i recently returned it to the store. It is cumbersome, sporadic heat/steam and doesnt work on heavier garments so I had to iron things anyway! It sat in the corner for most of the time simply taking up space and gathering dust. I am going to look at the portable jiffy steamers after a travelling friend raved about hers."
1,I ended up in the ER...,"I put up with the spits and spurts as I enjoyed the large capacity water tank. My first Rowenta quit after only two years and I was foolish enough to buy another one. I always followed directions as steam can be dangerous. The pedal and light stopped working on the second machine. I ended up getting a deep second degree burn. This is an awful machine and trying to work with the company was even worse. I will never buy another Rowenta product. I bought a much less expensive steamer at a department store(on sale). I have to fill it more often, though it has never spit nor spurt. It works better than the Rowenta."
1,Very disappointed,I have four teenagers who love to wear clothes that need to be pressed. I thought this would save me a lot of time. It did an o.k job on most of their clothes but my clothes looked wilted and you could still see the where the wrinkles had been. I am sending it back.
2,Different,"This book is different I guess the best way to describe it. It tells stories and I don't see where I benefited from the book. The author is very judgmental attitude but there isn't real depth as one reviewer stated. I wasn't impressed, I wouldn't say it was a waste of money but my time is what I lost on this book. It just is different."
2,"Come ci, Come ca","A previous reviewer expounded ad nauseum on the anger and rage that MUST be felt by fat women the world over; almost as though he himself has been involved with women of size and felt their wrath. However, that is more indicative of his own issues (why keep choosing women with these issues? He himself must be overly familiar with anger and rage) than an indicator of the value of the book. I found the book to contain many of the familiar diatribes and platitudes of any recovery program, without the depth. This is not to say that there were NO redeeming qualities; simply that such a simplistic ideology about the reasons for obesity insult the individual who suffers from such a disease."
4,Clear And Useful,"The title of R.A. Torrey's book suggest something along the lines of a Charasmatic experience, involving speaking in tongues and emotional hype. But he suprises the reader with a thoughtful look at how the Holy Spirit should opperate in the lives of true Christians. There are certain gifts that men are born with, and many lay dorment until the Holy Spirit awakens them. This book challenges people to awaken their God given gifts (all good gifts are from God and given even to those who are not Christians). Whether it is leadership (rom 12:8), teaching (Rom 12:7), craftsmanship (Exodus 31:2), or other gifts, we must let the Holy Spirit mold them to their optimum.Kudo's to the author for an insightful and inspiring work. Although I disagree with the title, and would prefer the term ""Being Filled With the Spirit (Eph 5:15-18 and Acts 4:24-31)"""
4,Basic information on the formation and establishment of the Catholic Church in north and east Texas,"It provides a lot of information from the 1900s to the 1950s, especially in establishing the newer dioceses in Texas"
2,Don't be decieved by the title,"I bought this book when it was new, so i didn't know that it is a collection of short stories. I wanted to read more about 'Mina and her family. Instead i got stories of people on other worlds than Pern and the story i already have from another book i bought.If you are looking for Pern, this is not the book to buy.Don't start reading Anne Mc Caffrey with this book!"
2,Very Disappointing,"I read this book about a year ago and then picked it up again and tried one more time...no luck...I just don't get it. I've really enjoyed Anne McCaffrey's other books, such as the Pern Series, the Crystal Singer books and the ""Talented"" series. I was very frustrated with ""The Girl Who Heard Dragons"" because I wanted to read more of THAT story...not the others in the book. I felt like I was left hanging."
1,Not a good collection of short stories.,Of all the 15 short stories in this book I only liked three. I was disappointed.
1,What????,"I was so utterly confused! I loved the first story and I was really looking forward to hearing more about Aramina, but the next chapter was about some outer space colony! Then, the third was about someone interviewing an opera singer! I thought it was a misprint! If anyone does find the original ""Girl Who Heard Dragons"", please,let me know."
3,The buyer needs to know . . .,". . . that although the title of the book is ""The Girl who Heard Dragons"", only the first story (and many of the details in the introduction) is actually a short story about Pern. For me, this was no big deal, as I bought the book for the Pern story -- and was pleasantly surprised at the introductory material.The short story itself is a natural lead-in to the full-length novel ""The Renegades of Pern"" from a somewhat different perspective.McCaffrey's introduction will please those looking for ""inside information"" about MaCaffrey herself and some of the thoughts and ideas behind the series. Don't get involved in an argument about religion with her, however! She intended Pern to be religion free -- and so it seems to be. (Though I've often wondered that none of the characters in any of the stories are seen engaging in ANY sort of philosophical speculation.)I'm glad that I purchased this book -- but can understand why some buyers are frustrated."
1,Huh??,I was mystifed to say the lest. I remember reading The Girl Who Heard Dragons in High School and having the whole book be about Aramina. I loved that one. This one was most frustrating as you walk into every story somewhere in the middle..at lest that was how I felt as I struggled through the book. I never did make it to the end. If the orginal is somewhere still in print please let me know.
3,Information for those who want to know,"The story ""The Girl Who Heard Dragons"" is included in another book of short stories, all of them about Pern. It is called ""A Gift of Dragons"" and it is a much better choice for Pern lovers."
1,Huh?,"I started reading this book and loved the 1st story but then I got really confused, all of a sudden it totally changed plot. I was expecting the whole book to be about Aramina. It was a real let down because the blurb suggested nothing of the sort. This was the 1st Anne McCaffrey book I have ever read and, by the way, if any one who is reading this has read other of her books, please, tell me what I should read next. I need some help!!"
1,a bit disappointing,"When I bought this book in the bookstore, it sounded exciting, but unfortunately, it does not say anywhere on the cover (or even inside - to my knowledge) that it is a collection of short stories, not a full length novel. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed, when at the end of the first story, I began reading what I thought would be the next chapter, but instead it was a completely different story. Had I known this was a collection of short stories, I probably would not have bought this book in the store."
2,Yikes!,"I really do love Anne McCaffrey's writing and the stories in this book are great. What I didn't like is that it's a collaboration of short stories, but nowhere on the cover does it tell you it's going to be that way! I honestly thought it was all about a fantasy story about a ""girl who heard dragons."" I am heavily dissappointed. But, I still love Anne:)"
2,The Ending,"The story itself is wonderful but,I do not like how you decived me into thinking that the whole book was about the girl who heard dragons.If you are going to print a short story with another story that is very boring the least you coulddo is to tell thse people in bold,large print,and dark letters.Alos the ending sucks.The way you ended the story is a very bad way to endd a story.I was very dissapointd all of your books I have read this foar were good but you let me down on this book."
5,Smooth striding.,I really like this elliptical strider. Set up was easy. The gliding motion is very smooth and quiet. It is a light-weight piece of equipment. There are no cables holding the feet rests on the machine that can twist or break: The metal pieces used on this machine are much sturdier.
4,Unearth destroys,"The production value of both DVDs is top notch. Excellent sound quality, excellent/funny documentary of the band. The downside comes from the substitute drummer throwing the band off beat on some of the songs, particularly from In The Eyes of Fire. The drummer gets fatigued and slows a bit while the rest of the band can play faster. Other than that, the live show it's crazy and sounds great. The singer doesn't fatigue at all. Also worth noting is the portions between songs are cut out for CD-like tracking. It's a plus and a minus, matter of opinion. Great DVD overall. FANS MUST BUY THIS. It's definitely worth every penny and showcases just how intense and ridiculous the band can be."
5,Roots of Chacter,I recieved this book in a timely manor and in almost new condition. I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,Roots of Character,"It is one of the best workbooks to help a Christian develop the character of Christ. This book has helped our students to evaluate their lives and be more Christlike and learn to love others. The exercises aredesigned to provide guidelines to remove areas, of prideimmorality etc and replace them with humility etc."
4,Time to uncover these unknown players.....,"I found this CD by doing a search for Buzzy Feiten......had heard of Peter Erskine, but not the others. Buzzy is a well established smoking hot guitarist that has played with Neil Larsen, Boz Scaggs, The Rascals, Dave Weckl and others. This is great jazz and if you have not heard of Buzz Feiten before now, it is your time."
3,Searching for a style,"This album is a compilation of his previous albums ""El Exigente"", ""Me and My Monkey"", ""Electric Harlow"" and ""Presenta a Ismael Miranda"". Most if not all of the tracks feature Ismael Miranda on vocals. ""El Malecon"" and ""Guasasa"" are enjoyable as well as ""Mi Madre"" a heartfelt tribute to mothers. The best track is ""La Revolucion"" which is the only one that truly resembles salsa dura and saves it from a lower rating. This album is highly influenced by Boogaloo and Ching-a-ling (remembering that these songs were done in the 60's) forms making it an average album at best. Larry seemed to be searching for style of music and clearly had not found it yet. If you are looking for great SALSA, you're better off with ""Hommy: A Latin Opera"" or ""Salsa"" Harlow's truly great masterpieces."
2,Oh dear...not very good,"I'm afraid only you die-hard authentic quilters will enjoy this book. It's from 1975 and has simply not aged well. You can get much more clearly-illustrated quilt books which will be worth your while to invest in. While this book does have many color plates (they're still ""plates"" instead of just photos) as well as some patterns, you'll be hard-pressed to get much mileage out of this. Sorry."
4,Pretty good flick,"This movie took me by surprise. I thought it would be a slasher movie and even tho there are bloody scenes (not many), there was an actual plot to the movie. You have to wait till the end to find out tho. I may just watch it again!"
3,not what i was expecting.,"I bought this after my daughter kept asking about it,,,I own over 700 dvds & I'm not upset that I bought it. It wasn't what I was expecting the most disturbing thing about it is when I found out its based on true events. Not alot of action but not real boring I always hate when reviews give the movie away so I never tell about the movie but the ending was a surprise. Not a lot of scares or gore but not a bad movie either."
3,What The?,"Ok while I find this movie mildly entertaining, the fact that it could even be loosely based on something real is quite scary. That being said, I think the movie missed a key compenent in the end. **SPOLIER ALERT** While it is great that Beth was able to get her baby back, what happened to the other 5 babies? Were they placed in foster care, were they reunited with the fathers, were they left to die? Seems like such a far fetched idea to pit 6 women against each other to see who is the strongest therefore knowing which baby would probably have the best genes. What a morbid way of picking out a baby to adopt!!!! And why only tell one of the six women the truth? How is that a fair fight to determine who is the best woman? Even more disturbing then not knowing what happens to the 5 babies, Beth was number 608, so if only 1/6 babies get selected, what happened to all those other babies over the years? I hate that this movie left that an open question to ponder."
2,Slow Movie,It was not one of the top ten on my husbands list. It was slow & didnt have that scary or gory storyline that most people who buy these movies like. I wouldnt recommend it at all.
3,Interesting,It wasnt exactly what I had expected but it was good movie. I love Tabrett so the movie was entertaining to me.
2,DON'T CHECK IN TO THIS CLINIC,"THE CLINIC is basically an unpleasant ""thriller"" focusing on a pregnant woman who finds herself battling a woman who sells babies on the black market. But her methods are quite nasty, involving a game of murder and competition.While the script tries for an inventive approach, it still manages to utilize many of the standard cliches: the sleazy motel manager, the corrupt redneck sheriff, the 40ish spinster villain, the retarded son, etc.Tabrett Bethell does a good job as Beth but the late Andy Whitfield as her fiance Cameron, who plays a pivotal role in the first half of the movie, is suddenly removed from the film in an unsatisfying manner.THE CLINIC is set in 1979 for some inexplicable reason purportedly something to do with pre-DNA testing. Ultimately, it's merely an unpleasant film with little redeeming qualities."
1,BORING -very disappointed,"I watched the entire movie which was a waste. I rented it because of Andy. It is a shame that he lost his life before he had a chance to bring his talent to the world. He will be always be remembered for Spartacus first season. If you haven't seen that, it is worth watching unlike this. He wasn't in the movie long enough to find one thing worth watching about it."
5,An exciting Viking romance.,"Gwyneth was just a girl when she rescued Selig, the young Viking her father was holding as a slave. Now she is a young woman, about to be married off to a man she despises. But before her wedding can take place, Viking raiders attack. Their leader takes Gwyneth captive. He is none other than Selig, the young man Gwyneth freed years ago. Selig is determined to keep his identity secret from Gwyneth, but he also wants to make her fall in love with him. Gwyneth finds herself with feelings for this Viking who has the same name as the boy she rescued out of love. But they have such opposing views of the world, how can they ever be together? I loved this book. It was full of action, suspense, and of course, a good love story. I'll definitely be reading other books by Kathryn Hockett."
3,Not Bad but Not Great Either,"The male character in this book has dialog that resembles the way a woman would think and feel, so he lost his edge, although the story is interesting."
3,good,"good little book for beginners; good photos, well laid out by season, easy to identify. just very skimpy in the amount of plants covered"
3,"not as much of the ""field guide"" I was hoping for","As the review's title says, I was expecting a book that was more concise. I'm from the area, I know all these backwoods like the back of my hand, so, I was hoping to find more knowlege in this book about all the plants that I already have all around me. I see all these plants, just never knew if they were edible. And I was hoping for a bigger section on what NOT to eat. There were only 3 plants that he cautioned about, with no pictures or descriptions, just a descriptions of their danger to you.On the other hand, I would recommend this book to those of you new to the pacific northwest, not the detailed field guide, for backwoods living... but a good guide for a backpackers day hike.Can someone recommend a broader book for me? Ive looked all over this site, came across this book, but just didnt meet my expectations."
3,Good for beginners,"This book lacks in both description and variety. Don't get me wrong, if you live in the pacific northwest and are just starting out in foreging...buy it. Just don't expect more than half a page reviewing the plant, half a page for color photo, and one page for sketch used to depict the scale of flora. There are 40 species discussed, and in my limited opinion, are common and well known. Some examples are...the maple, thistle, nettle, huckleberry, wild strawberry, thimbleberry, blackcap, salmonberry, clover, rose hips, mustard, miners lettuce, and various garden weeds."
1,Not So Good...,"Reading this book was drudgery. Corley's writing is fragmented, contradictory, and frustrating. This book has a whopping 64 pages of footnotes, yet there are places where information seems incomplete. She writes as if she has an axe to grind against someone... not sure whom. Just a general negative tone. I agree with the previous reviewer on all points. I do not recommend this book."
3,"The album isn't too bad for a remix but,","I perfer the real songs not by various artists...half the songs on the remix is ok but others are just plain boring.I am into trance, psychedelic trance music, and ambient, etc.Also I love the ozric tentacles an have every album they came out with.I believe if you are a REAL fan of any artists then by the albums they made emselfs not greatest hits crap or whatever....the remix an greatest hits CD's are only for people that are not true fans or just for beginners."
2,techno tentacles,"This CD is a compilation of techno remixes of classic Ozric Tentacles tunes. Most Ozric fans will probably not like it as the first thing to go is the guitar. None of Ed's excellent leads remain on any of these remixes, it's all synth drums and keyboards. The selection of songs is good, including Sploosh and Nuerochasm, but it gets pretty repetitive after awhile."
3,"I was in this movie, and I still didn't like it","When I was about 10, I got to be in this movie as an extra. Although it was a lot of fun to spend a day ""in Hollywood,"" this movie stunk. My family took me to see it when it came out in the theaters (it only came out as a ""sneak preview""; not enough people went to see it to qualify it as a hit), and we were greatly disappointed. If you want to see me, though, I'm the little boy on the lottery T.V. show when the main character is watching T.V. at his father's funeral."
5,COPING WITH LOSS...,"Men Don't Leave is a portrayal of the obstacles and challenges one woman faces after the untimely death of her husband.Burdened as a single mom without a job, whose husband has left her penniless, Beth Macauley (Jessica Lange) pulls up roots and moves to the city--to a grim apartment.Her children deal with their father's death and their mother's new roles in ways that challenge her even more.Struggling, she sometimes faces such depression that she doesn't think she can go on.But then unexpected blessings appear on the horizon, reminding her that life does go on."
5,DVD....Please!!!!,"Are you aware of how much crap is on DVD? This film, clearly being one of the best I have every seen is not on DVD in 2005, What!! But your telling me I can get Home Alone 7 anywhere. For me (and I'm sure I'm not alone on this) I like to collect movies that can shake me to the bone with their visual beauty and unforgetable wisdom...these movies have the ability to open our eyes, expand our veiw, teach us while showing the absolute wonder it is to be human....this movie moved me tremendously! Please, We need this movie (on DVD) for our collection! Don't let this wonderful film disappear, I would pay a high price to own this! Tell me where I can petition and my name is there. ~ ~Bob Mason."
3,Not bad for Lange fans,"Jessica Lange is wonderful as a stressed out mother of two boys. She is at her quivering, on the edge of sanity best. The rest of the movie is okay, Joan Cusack's performance is pretty good as well. But it's really a movie for serious Jessica Lange fans."
3,"Worth getting, but there are better albums out there...","I'm not a huge fan of Dark Tranq in general, but I really loved Damage Done. I bought this one about a week ago, and I'd have to say that if you are just ""getting into"" this band you might enjoy offerings further back in their catalog.I'm at a loss to explain what it is, but something about Fiction just doesn't sit right with me. There are some killer riffs on offer, and the second track is great, but as a whole the album just doesn't seem to hang together the way others have.Fans of Dark Tranq will of course REQUIRE this album, but for others I would suggest either older albums or anything Opeth has done lately."
3,Another Year with A DT release,"AND.............I finally am tired of this sound....Everysong on this album sounds like every other Dt Song..Boring Melodic Death Metal Again...Im a huge fan of them too love there first 6 albums or so, didn't like character all too much and this is def Better then that but nothing ill write home about. Most songs are not bad at all just nothing is NEW, if you want more of the same buy it, if your a Dt fanboy/girl you'll love it."
2,"genre-traitors, sellouts, etc","i can't really tell if the songwriting sucks or not, the sterile radio ready production renders the music so completely unmetal that it fades to the background of my awareness even when i try to focus on it. it seems like rock music but it's been compressed into something that could more accurately be categorized as ambient drone. every instrument, guitar, drums, vocals, sound like synthesized samples rather than organic performance. i can't fathom why any band that's been doing the metal thing since the 90s, since before this compressed reverb production technique spread through modern rock like a cancer, would let a producer do this to their music. this record is strictly for the emo-metalcore kids."
5,No complaint's here,I just think this Is an all around perfect dt album and I have nothing bad to say about it exept it's to short. THere's a little clean vocal's in there haven't heard that since Haven. tied for my favorite with damage done. don't agree? Don't care. Ithink dt have done their best work from damage done on. I'm not one of those people who only like the bands first two albums and then compare everything else to that. so very lame and pathetic. anyway these guys really did not disappoint me here bravo
4,DT keep seperating themselves from Inflames,"As good as Character is, this album kills it. DT have definitely out done themselves here. Fiction is probably the best Gothenburg style albums I have heard in a while. It is a lot better than what has come out of the In Flames or Children of Bodom factories lately. This album is a good combo of fast riffs with the right amount of melodic parts mixed in. There are not many clean vocal parts, however, Stanne's death vocals don't seem redundant like some bands in this genre do."
5,Great Anime Music!,"I simply love the beats offered on this CD. The music is very mellow and is great as ambiance. Some of the tracks are upbeat and fast-paced. These tracks would work well as background music to home movies or shorts.The music is straight from the anime and when you listen to it, it feels like you are in the anime. This is a great soundtrack and has some memorable music. Its a must have for anime, Samurai Champloo and techno fans."
2,Solid Album but......,"Like a previous review mentioned, this CD is more like a sampler of the other Original Soundtracks for Samurai Champloo such as the Departure or Masta OSTs which feature more and better tracks from the series. Not to say this release is completely shot as it still provides a good taste or tease of what's better available on the other OSTs. Definitely hip-hop oriented with some great beats, a couple of which I actually sampled for a class audio production project and it worked out great. I also find some of the beats great inspiration for my own work. I gave 2 Stars even though I still enjoy what's on this album, but since there are better OSTs for this great Anime I had to go for a lower rating."
3,Great with the show - not so great on its own,"Most of the tracks on this CD make pretty pointless listening outside of the context of the actual show. The songs that play over the opening and ending credits (""Battlecry"" and ""Song of the Seasons"" respectively) are pretty catchy, and that's why I bought the CD, but the rest of the tracks feel like filler drum loops in comparison."
2,"Good beats, but they can't stand alone","For the most part, the Samurai Champloo soundtrack plays like the instrumental cuts hip hop artists sometimes release alongside EPs - it's a collection of beats in want of a rapper. They're great beats, and with vocals to complement them they would make great songs, but they are too repetitive to stand alone. Hopefully some aspiring rapper will make use of these, or a grey-album style mix will find its way onto the internet, but the album itself is not recommendable.(That said, the music works very well in Samurai Champloo, and is one of the reasons the show is worth seeing)."
2,Disappointing,"I have seen the first 4 episodes of Samurai Champloo, and I'm a big fan of the show so far. I love the music and I think it works wonderfully within the show. However, with the exception of 2 tracks (Battlecry and Shiki no Uta), the whole CD is very repetitive and uninspiring. Maybe I've been spoiled by Yoko Kanno scores, but this one just didn't seem to have a lot of life in it. If it had not been included for free with the DVD, I probably would not have gone to the trouble of purchasing it. I'd recommend saving your money for something else."
5,Sweet!,"Good soundtrack! Very Good, but not as good as Cowboy Bebop. I think Yoko Kanno is the best anime music composer I've ever heard!Later,dark"
5,This game is fun for all Disney lovers!,"I got this game for my birthday and as soon as I opened it I was playing it and having a great time. Not only can you create your own skater, you can skate as Woody, Buzz, Jesse, and Zurg from Toy Story. You can play as Simba, Nala, Timon and Pumbaa, and as Rafikki from the Lion King. And finally you can play as Tarzan, Jane, Tantor, and Turk from Tarzan. It is great fun and I enjoyed it very much."
3,Not a good value,"I have owned the blender for about 2 years. Similar to other reviews, I would agree that the puree function lacks a bit. I made shakes and baby food in it and there are always lumps. Today the rubber teeth completely disintegrated and now the blender is useless. I called KitchenAid and they had great customer service but since it is out of warranty it is going to cost me almost the same price to fix as get a new one. Bummer. I will replace this with a different brand by the end of the week."
2,Blenders should be able to blend!,"This blender has a lot of power and I emphasize a lot of power. But this is not the blender for you, if like me, you make shakes, smoothies, and health drinks on a daily basis. This blender does not blend. No matter what the ingredients, no matter how long I blended, there was always unblended bits stuck at the bottom; bits of banana, ice, or protein powder. And because this blender is sooo powerful, there is no way you can even take off the 2-ounce cup to add ingredients. The blender splashes everything to top, so if you want to add anything you have to stop the blender. Plus, you lose a lot of your drink to the very strange plastic lid. I'm returning mine. I've had better performance from less expensive blenders."
3,Powerful yet motor burns after 3 months,Can you say this is one of the worst blenders I've ever used. The customer service is terrible. I called them after having a problem with my blender. I only used it a few times in the 3 months that I got the blender. The motor burns- this was from making a smoothie. In my attempts to receive help the customer service representative offers to sell me a refurnished model of a blender I already have which stills broken and unrepaired in its original box. I will update once I get this KitchenAid to repair the blender. So far my experience has not been a pleasant one. I an weary about purchasing another kitchenAid product because of the customer service.
1,not very durable,"I had one of these blenders for about three years. It worked fine and then died suddenly, after only moderate use during the three years (usage averaged less than once per week.) I would not buy another one."
2,Blender Blow-up!,"This blender has a very powerful motor and I've been impressed with it's longevity...I've had it for nearly 10 years! BUT...the design of this model is awful. There have been MANY times when I've lifted the glass jar off the base only to have the entire contents (red tomato sauce, brown chocolate mousse, green pea soup...etc!) drop like a bomb on my kitchen floor and SPLATTER everywhere! Absolutely a party spoiler just before numerous parties I've given! I curse this blender every time I use it and just yesterday, it finally died for good and I am happily shopping for a new and better designed blender. Beware of this blender especially with children. My three kids love to make smoothies but they ALWAYS have this bottom-dropping-out problem with this blender. They cheered when the motor burned up yesterday! Trust me - stay away from this design!"
1,Don't buy it,"First of all let me say I have KitchenAid everything- fridge, dishwasher, mixer, coffeemaker, toaster, you name it. I usually love their products. This blender, therefore, was a HUGE disappointment. It died after a year of ownership. Probably only used it about a dozen times, total. It was my first bad experience with KA customer service, which tells me they know something's wrong with the design. They refused to do anything since it was a year old. I won't be replacing it with another KitchenAid, that's for sure."
1,get a fire extinguisher,I have had 2 of these and they work great at first but after awhile of making ice type bar drinks it will smoke and or the electronics wear out. Kitcen aid is great for major appliances but i am buying a wearning blender next
3,Not worth the price,"Get this if you want slushies with lots of ice in the mix. Don't get this if you want a smooth creamy smoothie. The KitchenAid is powerful when it comes to crushing ice, but that's about it. Does not work well with smaller portions either. If you just want a good ole fashioned smoothie, get an Oster at a fraction of the price, and it works better. If you want to make slushies for the entire family of 4+, then get this, since all the ice will melt if you don't drink it right away, so there's no point of storing it for later."
1,Kitchenaid blender,"Most expensive and worst blender I have ever had. Leaves chunks even after going through the speeds, leaks from the top even though only half full, will not slush ice, etc. Will never buy another KitchenAid anything. Junk."
3,The best blender but buyer BEWARE!!,"This blender is by far the best blender I have ever owned. It can blend and chop anything. It's the first blender that I don't have to stop constantly to help the blender in it's task. My biggest complaint is that this product has a faulty part. It is the plastic part there the blade spins. The metal that connects with this eventually causes it to break off some of the pieces, rendering the blender unusable. My sister's blender actually started burning because of the friction. I have only had my blender for a year and a half and its already wearing thin. KitchenAid refuses to replace or fix this problem even though plenty of customers have complained about the issue."
3,Pureeing capability needs improvement,"My wife and I have been fans (and owners) of KitchenAid appliances for years. This includes refrigerators, dishwashers, food processors, and various utensils. We had high expectations when we selected this blender. Our unit has exhibited good reliability, but the performance is lackluster. Ice is incompletely crushed, which leaves lumps in drinks. Even bananas and strawberries (which are rather mild materials) are not completely pureed, after 30 seconds of high-speed attempts. I wonder if the circular/cylindrical shape plays a degrading role. The blades, though very durable, are not all that sharp. We had much better performance from Oster and Hamilton Beach. Price is not a barometer of quality."
3,Works Well Except with Ice.,"I bought this to make smoothies with because of a great sale price on amazon.com With 575 watts, i thought it would be more than powerful enough. While it can chop ice and produce a good smoothie, I find it involves a bit of work. Basically, I have to spend 5-10 minutes pulsing the blender on progressively faster settings, all the while sticking in a spoon to mix up the contents frequently. For softer foods, the blender works like a charm. Overall the look, size, amount of noise, mess and cleanup wonderful. If you don't plan on putting ice in it, this is a great blender for you. Otherwise, you might need something with a little more power. One last thing, the reviewer that mentioned contents sitting just above the blades is right. This happens to me when i have ice and a little bit of liquid in the blender. A pocket of air forms and the blender and you'll need to stir the contents around."
1,"Extra! Cool-looking blender chokes on sherbet, strawberries!","To be concise:I ordered enthusiastically.I received and took it out for a smoothie-spin.It ground to a halt (still running, just...not with blades performing their function) when I dared to drop in one cup of frozen strawberries.It completely balked when, in a moment of wild abandon, I added two small scoops of not-even-particularly-frozen sherbet.To make a concise story even more brief. Here's my morning ritual: I add, I turn on, I turn off, I stir with spoon, I hope, I turn on, I turn off, I stir with spoon, I hope, I turn on... And voila! A smoothie. It's just made by me--not by this sucky blender."
2,Not very durable,"I thought I was buying a quality product but I was disappointed. Shortly after my warranty expired one of the teeth on top of the motor broke when I was trying to make a smoothy. I called Kitchenaid to see what it would take to get repaired and was told $55 plus parts! My previous blender lasted 24 years, worked great, and in that time never needed a repair. So my next blender will NOT be a Kitchenaid as I have no desire to repair or replace such an expensive blender frequently."
5,"Very solid, no-nonsense blender","I purchased the KSBWW after first getting, then returning, an Oster model that was a bit less expensive. The Oster looked practical and like a good value, but it was a very shoddy plastic body with a double-walled plastic jug. I hated it immediately.But this one, wow, what a difference. It is heavy-duty, with a squat glass jar. The blades are easily three times the thickness of the Oster's. This one has ""only"" five speeds, but I'd be fine with even the three-speed model. Really, do we absolutely have to have ten different choices? It's like in the excellent KitchenAid food processors: On and off would really be almost sufficient.I can't speak to its longevity, but I'm certainly willing to believe it's going to be on par with my other KitchenAid items."
1,Overpriced and under-quality,"This is a cheap, over-priced product. Don't waste you money! I used my blender to make ice and fruit drinks, which were never blended fully. After only a few years of use the plastic coupler broke and now the item is useless."
2,OK when it worked,Friends gave us this blender. The entire rubber coupling ground off for no reason all of a sudden one day. I don't use it that often so it wasn't abused. The only time we even crush ice in it is when they are here (once a year). I had an Osterizer for years and never had problems with it. I guess our friends just didn't like the avocado green. Glad I didn't get rid of the Oster. I don't recommned this one. I think Kitchenaid is going downhill. I've had a 5 QT mixer for years and loved it. Then bought the 6QT that has since died after one year. They need to get their act together.
5,powerful blender,"bought it a few weeks ago and have been using it. It's very powerful, strong, smooth, and i like the 5 speed options it provided!!! It's easy to clean up and works well w/ many ingredients. Not to mention, i like the sleek look of this blender as well."
5,sin este disco no hay navidad,"Excelente, todas las canciones son clasicos. En Panama no hay navidades sin estas canciones, ademas de que contiene la cancion que es el himno nacional, ""la murga de Panama"". Se nota que se divirtieron produciendolo, que es lo mejor de los discos de Willie Colon, y Yomo Toro la boto en el cuatro como siempre. Its a must have."
1,Amateurish and Unauthentic,"There is a case to be made for instrumental accompaniment of polyphonic masses, though many musicologists are hostile to it, but there is no musical or historical justification for the kind of mixed consort used on this CD. The viol da gamba, for instance, hadn't even been invented in the lifetime of Dufay. Aside from such purisms, however, this is an out-of-date amateurish version of Dufay -- ""early"" Early Music, around 1974. It should be retired. If you want to hear where the art has arrived in the meantime, choose any disk by The Orlando Consort, Ensemble Organum, Ensemble Officium, The Clerks' Group, Capella Alamire, Ensemble Clement Janequin. There are NO well-done CDs of Dufay era masses with instruments; I say this with utmost sadness, since I am an instrumentalist."
3,busqueda interesante,"Sin duda alguna se trata de una propuesta interesante, oscura, dolorosa... con una buena cantante, plagada de imágenes..."
5,Cover for my KitchenAid applicance,"I looked high and low for a suitable cover for this mixer. It is a large item, so I was delighted to find the cover at Amazon. Thanks for being so good."
3,Makes the mixer look so big when the cover is on,"It kind of surprised me, as the mixer now looks a lot bigger on my counter with the cover on it. I've gotten used to it, but it was a little strange at first."
3,perfect for the lazy people,"the mixer cover is perfect for those who like to leave their stand mixer on the counter without it getting dusty from not being used. This cover is nothing special but it beats having to make on yourself. Otherwise, there's nothing special about this cover."
1,I don't know!,I ordered this 3 weeks ago and now they tell me that it won't ship until mid MAY !!!I won't buy from Amazon again
4,Gift for daugher,"Got this for my daughter, age 27, when she requested a cover for her Kitchen-Aid mixer for Christmas. This one is very nicely made, good quality, goes with everything. The black trim makes it trendy!"
5,KitchenAid Stand mixer cover,This is a must for your KitchenAid. It gives excellent protection.It fits the 5 and 6 quart mixers great.
5,Great Mixer Cover,"I have purchased other mixer covers in the past, but they never completely covered my mixer. This one does, and I love it. It's also weighted so it stays in place and I also love the pocket on the side. I keep my often used recipe cards stored it there. Loved it so much that I purchased one for my mom too."
3,Not pretty but functional,It does it's job of keeping dust off the mixer and also holds accessories in it's pockets. I just wish we had room for the mixer in a cabinet because the cover is ugly to leave on the counter.
5,Mixer Cloth Cover,Well made and I like the pocket on the outside for storage of either a book or recipes. No more dust on my machine!
5,MADE HER HAPPY.,"BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE. SHE REALLY LIKED IT. KEEPS YOUR MIXER COVERED, AND PROTECTED. LIKED THE POUCHES ON THE OUTSIDE FOR OTHER STORAGE, GREAT PRICE!!"
4,Wish it was a tad bigger....,"Well made, shipped fast....I would have liked it to rest on countertop not just above. I do like it tho'."
1,DOES NOT FIT BOWL-LIFT MIXERS!!!!!!!!!,"even though it says it's designed to protect bowl lift mixers, this does not fully cover the pro 600 model. it has a good design, and it's a shame they don't just TELL you in the description."
3,"Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer Cloth Cover, White with black Trim","I purchased this cover because my old one was worn. I have a 6 quart pro mix and it stands taller than the 4/5 quart. The concerns that I have with both covers is that it does not fall long enough around the base of the mixer (and maybe there is a reason for that - let me know). Maybe revised the base of it with an elastic bottom to fit snug over the entire item. Secondly, I realize that it is cloth, but it attracts so much of the products you use to cook with if its any where near or in close proximity of the cover. When the items is washed - then its all over - because it loose its appearance and it seems to shrink. The black one was was (without bleach and it came out with splotches. Washed with like items it lost all of its color. Maybe a new material can be used. Thanks."
3,Does Not Fit 6 Quart,"Many reviews say that this cover fits the 6 quart perfectly, well this is not true. It is about an inch short of reaching the counter. It looks great having a white base sticking out beneath the khaki cover.Like white socks and khaki ""high-water"" pants."
3,KitchenAid Mixer cover,"I received the item that I purchased in about three days, which was great. However when I put the cover on my mixer, it is about 2 inches to short. I have a Kitchen Aid model that is referred to as ""professional"". I bought it at Costco and evidently is a bit larger than a standard Kitchen Aid mixer. I contacted the seller and she was very nice and doubled-checked for me to see if there was a different cover for my mixer. Since none was found, she told me I could certainly return it. I also contacted Kitchen Aid and they told me that they only made one size mixer cover and I had it. They did say that the mixers are different sizes and the one I have would be too tall for the cover! (even though it is advertised as fitting ALL mixers)However, they do not make another cover! :-( So, since the cover is very nice - thick and sewn well - I am keeping the cover and adding some trim on the bottom!"
3,Don't wash it!,"The label says not to wash it. Why would you make a cotton item for the kitchen and not make it washable?! We have a rule at our house that, if it doesn't survive either the dishwasher or the washing machine, we didn't need it anyway. Well, I washed the stand mixer cover, and it did, indeed, shrink. It fits fine around the mixer, but it's now high water at the bottom. Oh, well. It still keeps junk out of the bowl and dust and grime off the top, so I guess it still covers."
4,Kitchenaid Mixer Cover,"This cover is well made. I would have given it 5 stars, but it needs to be about 1 inch longer to completely cover the Pro 600 Series 6 qt. mixer that i bought."
5,perfect!,"I love looking at my kitchen aid, but not the dishtowel covering the bowl and parts from dust. I don't know why it took me so long to get this."
3,Looks like we're hiding something,"I purchased this cover to cover our Kitchen Aid KP26M1XNP Professional 600 Series 6-Quart Stand Mixer while it sits on our countertop. However, it looks like we are trying to hide something underneath; the cover fits a little snug around the 6-quart mixer. In the unlikely event that we move the mixer down to the basement, we'll use it then."
1,kitchen Aid Cover,Much too short. Needs to indicate a size of the machine. Poorly explained in description of the product as displayed on Amazon.com.
3,Too snug,"I have the KitchenAid 5 qt stand mixer. The cover was extremely snug. I had to yank and pull the cover to get it on. It is about 1 inch too short as well. However, I heard this is the only size cover and so I will just make do with it."
3,A bit too large for the KSM75 4.5 qt mixer,"The KMCC1WH cover is well constructed, but is 2"" too tall for my KMS75 4.5 qt mixer, and makes it seem enormous sitting on our small countertop.The cover is also padded - sort of like a giant tea cozy (teapot insulator), so that makes the outside dimensions even larger. I don't understand the need for padding - unless you engage in sword play with your cooking knives or your kids are conduct little league batting practice in your kitchen. I would think that a padded cover on an electrical appliance would be more of a fire hazard, and be harder to clean and dry than a non-padded cover. There seems to be some custom made 4.5 qt covers on eBay."
4,KitchenAid Mixer Cover,"We ordered this cover at the same time we ordered the Professional 600 stand mixer. Had to return the cover as it did not fit the mixer properly. It is an excellent cover for the smaller KitchenAid stand mixers, just doesn't work well with the 600."
5,KITCHEN AID STAND MIXER COVER,I am very pleased with the Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer cover because it is constructed of a very heavy duty fabric which will withstand everyday use. I have also found it extremely easy to keep clean. I would highly recommend this cover for anyone considering it.
2,KitchenAid Stand Mixer Cloth Cover,I recently ordered this product with the intent to use it to cover my KitchenAid stand mixer. This is a very well made product but I personally did not like the way it looked - strictly just a matter of personal preference.
5,Mixer Cover,"I have a red kitchenaid stand mixer, like the standard one they sell at target.it fits well and keeps my mixer dust free, and my recipes safe inside the little pocket.Great deal compared to the kitchenaid site, and its the same thing.fits well, not snug at all :)"
4,Mixer Cover,This product is well made and good looking enough to sit on your counter. I was pleased with the quality of this cover and it fit the mixer well. Was nice to have the pocket on the side for the beater.
4,To Go With My New Kitchen Aid,"This was suggested, by Amazon.com, as possibly being of interest to me with my new Kitchen Aid. Very sturdy and looks easy to wash. Was a little bulkier and heavier than expected."
5,Does exactly what it says - and it's so soft!,"Just ordered the khaki cover. It's an ""official"" KitchenAid product, which I like. And it's surprisingly soft. Well worth the 20 or so dollars to keep my mixer clean between uses."
3,I'm disappointed,"The cover is well made and looks very nice but, one washing and it shrunk1 1/2"" and is too short now!! I'm not happy!! :("
2,Lousy,Kind of ugly. Doesn't fit the shape of the machine too well. And not big enough. It hovers about an inch off the counter.
2,too short,The cloth cover does not fit my heavy duty kitchen aid as it was described in the specifications. I'm very disappointed because I can not returned it since I lived in south america and iI bought it when I was visiting USA.
5,mixer cover,Really happy with it. cheaper than at a local retailer and same quality. It fits my Kitchenaid Mixer perfectly. It was delivered quickly. I have no complaints
4,"Nice Item, kind expensive","I did not give a 5 Stars because I think is a little expensive, ot the shipping make it. But if fot perfectly and protect the Mixer, wich is the most important."
5,does its job,This cover does it's job well! it fits nicely over my UltraPower 4.5 Quart mixer. I love the side pouch for some of the flat attachments and the instruction manual. Worth the $$$!
5,nice,nice heavy material with side pockets for some of your attachments. looks nice on my counter top and easy to wash
4,Great Cover for a Great Product,I recently recieved my mixer as a christmas gift and wanted to get something that would cover it so it wouldn't collect dust when I didn't use it! This was the perfect thing to get after much debate over other things. The pocket makes for a great place to store the book that comes with the mixer along with the flat attachments like the dough hook. It feels strong and durable and thick and for my 5qt mixer it covers it plenty. Definitely a good investment to preserve your mixer!PS - get it in khaki!
5,Quality Product and Fast Delivery,"Kitchen Aid cover was exactly the perfect gift. Quality, clean style and a very quick transaction and delivery.Thank you!"
5,Kitchenaid cloth cover is a good buy,I ordered the cover for my artisan mixer and am very pleased with it. It is made of heavy canvas and is very durable. It covers my kitchenaid mixer very well even with the splatter shield on it and the two pockets on the side are good storage for small things.
4,"Very nice cover, but the fit is not too great.","I really like this cover. The quality is great and I love the color. I also love that pocket. It just doesn't completely cover my Kitchenaid Pro 6 qt. There is about a 1/2 inch gap between the bottom of the cover and the bottom of the mixer. That's disappointing, but not enough to make me want to return it. Except for the fit problem, it is a great cover!"
5,Great Service,I am very happy with this product and the service that I received. Will order again. Thanks.
5,Great Item,Looks good and fits well. Have not washed it yet but I'm going to wash it by hand to keep it in excellent condition.
5,Well...it's a cover!,"It is cloth, it fits, and it does a bang up job of providing coverage for the mixer. Hey, it serves its function...can't ask for more than that I guess!"
5,KitchenAid KMCC1WH Stand Mixer Cloth Cover,"Very satisfied with the product, good heavy cloth cover and high quality. I ordered two of them, one for my daughter and one for myself and we are both very satisfied with them"
4,One size fits all?,"This is a sturdy, well made mixer cover; especially compared to the plastic/vinyl type. It does exactly what is was designed to do...keep the dust and dirt off the mixer and protect it from minor bumps and scrapes. Clearly, in the world of stand mixers, one size does not fit all. Well, not perfectly, at least. I have a 5-quart lift-bowl mixer and, while the overall fit is very good, there is a one-inch gap between the bottom and counter. I agree with other reviews that the cover makes the mixer look even larger! But you get over that the same way you get over your first impression of what appears to be a gigantic, industrial machine on your counter when you first set up the mixer! I would have given this 5 stars, but I think it is a bit overpriced."
5,helps keep my kitchen clean,"The mixer cover is attractive and a nice, heavy cloth that fits securely over the KitchenAid mixer. It even has a side pocket for attachments, which was a great surprise since it wasn't mentioned in the description."
5,Perfect!,"I love to bake and have been doing it for quite a while now. I used to have a hand held mixer and did with that for a while as well. Last year, I got a KitchenAid Artisan stand mixer for Christmas in onix. It is the best gift I have ever gotten. It makes everything so much easier and all my baked goods come out perfect. Last week I decided to get a stand mixer cloth cover for my mixer and got the KitchenAid KMCC1KB in onix. I already received it and it looks very nice on my kitchen counter. It covers the whole mixer and I love the way it looks. It is PERFECT!"
4,Teenage mutant ninja turtle mutant melee,"Of course my godson played this game all the time when he got this for his birthday this is one of his favor games as well. he still plays it alot though, cars is his favorite at the moment!"
5,I love this video!,"I have a daughter who absolutely loves this video and I must say as a parent I love it too! It's about time somebody finally made a film that parents can watch with their kids. It's positive, educational and very entertaining - a rare thing in todays world of kid videos. It encourages a childs imagination aswell as it influences the joy of reading. Well done!"
5,"Fantastic soundtrack, not the usual","Sure ""Hemisphere"" is the hook to get people to buy the album but the real treasures are the dissonant jazz numbers. Definitely they are very evocative of Yoko Kanno's work on Cowboy Bebop but with it's own extra twist. I think the low-key jazz songs worked really great with the anime to set the mood."
5,love it.,Very gentle music. Works wonderful with meditation. Would recommend this mp3 to any one on a spiritual path. Thank you.
5,GREAT QUALITY,Book arrived very quickly and quality was even better than advertised. Will DEFINITELY use this website forall my children's college books!
3,school text book,I needed it for class. Text books are ridiculously expensive especially when they don't change much but just put a new picture on the front. It came quickly.
1,Review - amazon Purchase,"I ordered the book on February 19 and it was supposed to be delivered by March 5. The company did not sent it out in time so the money was refunded and the book was to be sent anyway. Well it is March 12 and still no book. I start my class today with no book and have to go and buy a new one from the book store at the college. I am very upset about this as the book new is $134.00. Not sure I would purchase from this company again. The book said it was in transit, but it has been that way since March 5. Sorry to have to write a bad review, but this was not good as I have no book to start my class with. Lisa"
4,Educational,Had to buy it for Biology 101.Its a very animated and educational textbook.The language wasnt difficult to comprehend.
5,Loved the book,The book was exactly what I expected of it and was in good condition even though it is a used book.
2,Ultimate Fail by Amazon,"paid for a 2 day shipping, got general shipping instead, was a book i needed for my college biology class, still haven't received the item and may cost me about a 100 dollars to go buy it from the book store as well just so i don't start out the semester with a F."
3,"Too much ""fluff""","The major problem with this book is that there is so much unnecessary paragraphs which can just be said in a couple of sentences. This book is only good for those who have major trouble grasping the concepts and are in need of a mass amount of analogies and metaphors. If you are looking for a Biology book straight to the point, this is not for you; a better book is ""Inquiry into Life"" by Sylvia S. Mader. Once I read ""Inquiry into Life,"" I found that ""Biology: Life on Earth"" was too drawn out. It is also not as detailed as I had expected it to be."
2,"Book for high school, not worth the money","This book goes into explaining Hardy-Weinberg principle and doesn't even have the equation for it! Nor does it mention two important words in the same chapter - dominant and recessive. If you want to look at pictures of animals and read over-simplified explanations then buy it. If your are looking for a scholarly book, then I would suggest to look elsewhere."
5,"Great Product, Arrived as Described","I ordered this black toner for my Samsung CLP 510 printer. It fit perfectly into the machine and lasted for several months. The price is great too. When comparing around, Amazon had the cheapest price for OEM toner by about $20. I am happy with the product and would order it again."
5,Greatness,"Well, it's about a dude name Joe. His girl gets kidnapped into a movie world, and now it's his duty to retrieve her The game is generally a 2D beat'em up. here's why it's so good....Graphics""Just plain good! Sooooo much detail. Colorful. Just bursting off your screen.Control:Super easy to get used to. X is the punch button.Y is the kick button.To do Joe's signature moves, you use the L and R buttons.Slow down time with the L button. Mach speed is set to the R button.Gameplay.The best! Super addictive fun!You can kick ass with all the style you want.You will be bustin' awesome combos till the very end of each level.Brilliant.Overall, just get the damn game.It gets released on october 7th.Major fun with this one."
5,awesome game,"Viewtiful Joe is a really awesome game. It reminds me of games that I played as a kid, but it was made much better than any of my old games. It's really a good buy, unfortunately it's only made for Gamecube."
5,Viewtiful Joe Is Great,"VJ is a great game, beutiful levels, great gameplay, great storyline what more do you want. The cell-shaded graphics work great with the game, you will love this game from start to finish."
5,Awesome!,"This game is the work of masters. It's orginal, creative, and fun to play. In this game your this punk named Joe who takes his girl-friend to a movie. When the movie is about to end the villian grabs Joe's girl-friend and takes her into the movie. Joe goes in too and gets super powers from the hero of the movie. Along the way you'll fight robots, slow and speed up time and even fight a clone of yourself. This game is almost like Enter the Matrix combined with Super Smash Bros. Melee and Blinx the Time Sweeper. Then once you beat the game as Joe you can even go back and replay the game as Joe's girl-friend. This game is the most orginal action/adventure/platformer game I have seen since Super Mario 64. If you liked Enter the Matrix and Super Smash Bros. Melee (and who didn't), your going to love this game. If you don't like this game then you have bad taste."
4,It's a Viewtiful World,"""Henshin-a-go-go baby!""This game is fantastic, such a breath of fresh air from the usual stuff that's being fed to us ever since video games went 'main stream.'The game offers a great cel-shading look to it that you would expect of a Japanese cartoon and adds to the atmosphere of the game. One of the first things I thought when I played the game was how much it looked like a comic book style and the entire game is very vivid and unique. Unlike most games these days, this is pure 2D beat-em' up goodness done right.You play as Joe, who gets sucked into 'movie-land' where he must save his girlfriend Silvia. But before he can, he learns how to use his 'hero' powers to transform himself into Viewtiful Joe! Gaining powers such as ""Slow"", ""Mach Speed"", and ""Zoom"", Joe must learn to use his new abilities to overthrow the evil Jadow and rescue MovieLand!From the makers of Devil May Cry comes a new action hit that's a must have for any gamer who's looking for a challenge!-- Hero"
5,Outstandingly Amazing,"When the Capcom 5 were first announced, Viewtiful Joe looked like the worst of the 5. Now that P.N. 03 is out, and that sucked, I went to get this game when it came out, hoping for good. And is it good! This is a shining example of why 2d games are still the best to this date. Beautiful art style (viewtiful... :) ), solid, challenging gameplay, lots to do and unlock, and the best final boss EVER, make this game quite an easy contender for Game Of The Year. This game is worth the cheap $40 price tag, and easily more. Go now and get it!"
5,Henshin A Go Go Baby,"A fantastic game from the people who would go on to make Okami and would eventually to go on to form Platinum Games (Bayonetta and Metal Gear Rising). While I don't think it's as good as the sequel, the experience is still top notch and I recommend this to gamers young and old, even if it is a little on the hard side."
5,Very good quality,"The artwork on the front of the case seemed a bit faded, but the disk was in near perfect condition and didn't skip at all."
4,Cool,"I recently had a chance to play Viewtiful Joe for the Nintendo GameCube, and I must say, I'm very Impressed. Anyways, In the game you play as Joe, who is sucked into the ""Movie World"", and must battle enemy robot/skull/bat/joker things(trust me, they're cool)using Kung-Fu. After a ways through, you are granted a ""henshin""(transform) ability. When your meter fills up, you transform in to Viewtiful Joe, a Power-Ranger like superhero with cool abilities. VJ can slow down time, Matrix-style, and dodge bullets and all of that great stuff. Or, VJ can go ""Mach-Speed"" and bash enemies at blazing, Sonic the Hedgehog speeds. If you get a chance, buy the demo..."
5,Must get,"i have really missed out on viewtiful joe since 2003.cuz i just wasnt intrested but now im planing to buy viewtiful joe,viewtiful joe 2,and viewtiful joe red hot humble[i dont have a ds so i cant get the ds viewtiful joe game"
2,OK GAME NOT OK GRAPHICS,If you are like me one of the most important things to you is the games graphics than viewtiful joe may not be the game for you at first they are bad and as the game goes along i find them to be no better
1,cute joe,This game is the dumbest game i have ever played in my life. It is worse than aqua man wich really sucked. He run around and does splits like a dumb ass and the fighting is retarded
4,An Instant Classic That Still Has It,"I played Viewtiful Joe when I was younger, but it eventually got worn out and wouldn't play any more. After buying another copy here, I found the game to be just a good as when I first played it. Definitely worth it."
5,Viewtiful Game,This is PopcornDemon review for Viewtiful Joe Online Street Team.This is a game everyone will love. If you don't like sidescrollers you will now! Once you start this game you can't stop! You are warped into a movie trying to rescue your girl from the bad guys! With this you will get special powers(VFX)called SLOW (like the Matrix where you can dodge bullets) Zoom in(zooms in) and Mach Speed(Speeds everything up.) It is an awesome game that everyone from all ages will love!!!!
4,best cartoon video game style on the market!,This is by far the best cartoon style game ever created! The 2D graphics are excellent! This is the best gamecube game ever! This game is much better than Halo.Gameplay:10Graphics:Easy 10Controls:10-controls are really easy to remember.This game is the best game ever created and makes a great gift. You should buy this game if your an expert gamer because this game is really hard. I got this game on christmas and i'm only on episode 2! All together this is is a great game! Go buy this game!
2,Not really useful...,"The only reason I bought this is because I bought the game with this which gave me 20% off on the guide. Only buy this if you get lost easy, can't follow instructions, have both console and pc versions, and you get a discount on it. The details on where to go are not really descriptive because the game is so simple. It points out the obvious and in some parts it doesn't even tell you where to go next. The guide is extremely short, also. Yes, it does look like a solid book but only half of it is on the console version of the game. The other half of the book is on the pc version. You'll be done with the book before you know it."
1,"RUN AWAY AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM THIS PLAYER, PLEASE","Don't buy it if you don't have time and energy to figure out how to turn it on right off the box. I got my today. After 3 hours of charging, it doesn't bother to be on. I am calling Archos while I type this review. There is no help from them at all ( ""your call is important to us...."" but I have been waiting for 68 minutes). Why they don't pick the damn phone to talk to me. That is suck!!! Never buy anything from Archos again. Piece of crab. Run away from it as far as you can, please. Give up on this player. Don't waste your time and money like me!!!!!!!!!!"
4,almost there,"Overall it is great. Size, features, except the screen. The size is not the issue, but rather the resolution. At 320x24o it is just too low for this size screen. Also the viewing angles are bad, tilt it up 20 degrees and it looks too dark. The brightness of screen is better than the 604 and less than the 604 wifi(i bought them all to compare and kept the 604 wifi). The colors are also too saturated (unnatural). Overall, put a better screen on this, and i would pay 50% more. Are you listening archos?"
4,Fantastic Media Player,"This Device Had a lot of feature That I didnot know about it before, After that I loved it.For the Video, you can just drag and drop your file without compression needed of software. It plays all my DIVX movies, moreover, I can take them back without any need of any Software. just like external H.D.Screen is vary good, bult-in speeker is not that bad but the sound volume was not as I expected!!!The things I dont liked about this device is battery recharging witch took a lot of time, mey be bucause I am using the USB cable olny without any docking station.Overall I recommed This device."
4,Very good pmp device.,"I owned a Zune 30 before i bought this. But the new updated software just killed the Zune. I had been looking at this Archos 404 for sometime now. This blows away any Zune or Ipod and its 4th generation. I forgot how great it is to have a device thats not linked to bad software or any software period. It does everything really easy and video and music look and sound great on it. You can buy the 2 extra plugins for it to give you more codec choice and thats only 40 dollars more,but trust me its worth it. The device will almost play anything. Drag and drop truely is a wonderful thing. I have put my Zune up for sale and i'm glad i finally got the 404."
2,Very bad customer service,"I loved the Archos 404, when it worked! The navigation is very clumsy though and not user friendly. The display is great. All together a good deal. (Or at least you would think that...)My unit broke about every 2 months. Repair was free through the Archos Guarantee, but it was very painful and included hours on the phone, the first hour usually until they answered the phone.Their website is hardly functional (always asking you for your country, even when you are logged on with your address etc.) and doesn't provide any troubleshooting or other helpful info. Archos needed several weeks to answer my emails.I had it now after the 4th repair. So extremely sorry guys, but I have other things to do."
5,Great bargain!,"This is a great knife for the price. It's weighted perfectly - it feels quite heavy in your hand and the grip is very nice. I don't know how they sell it so cheap! This is certainly not the finest knife around, but for not much better, you'ld be paying 7-8 times as much. I have this and a very fine knife, and the difference is honestly negligable.Don't let the price steer you away from this knife - it's better than it's priced at!"
4,Outstanding Work,"The author expresses outstanding work through words, through imagination, and through her heart. Echoes of the Heart was truly a pleasure to read twice ! I have passed the book onto my friends I enjoyed it so much. Thank you Nancy Destiny so much for sharing with me your wonderful words !"
5,Nice moments,I spent some nice moments reading this book. It s a good summer reading suggestion. Thank you Mrs Destiny.
4,A scandalous masquerade,"Calliope Minton's greatest plesure is capturing the members of the ton at their worst. For unbeknownst to the ton, Calliope is a charicaturist for a London scandal sheet and one of her favorite subjects is James Trenton, Marquess of Angelford. Calliope has disguised herself as a dowdy companion in order to attend the ton functions to gether material. James is certain that she is hiding something and he intends to find out what that might be, but in the meantime he is occupied with trying to expose the ""artist"" who is humiliating him in the papers. But then, Calliope and James are thrown together when one of their mutual acquaintances vanishes and someone is trying to abduct Calliope.I thoroughly enjoyed this debut novel and since there are three close male friends who work for the crown in this book, I assume there will be two more books in this series. I certainly hope so."
5,Edna: queen of the sonnet,"""Fatal Interview"" is a sequence of 52 numbered sonnets by Edna St. Vincent Millay. The title comes from a line by John Donne. I may be committing literary blasphemy, but I do believe that ESVM writes better sonnets than even William Shakespeare!""Fatal"" is all about love, an emotion ""like a burning city in the breast"" (XXVI). The sonnets are full of passion, intelligence, and striking turns of phrase. There are a number of classical references (Helen, Troy, Aeneas, etc.). There are also many references to the natural world; the speaker claims to be ""country-bred"" (XLVI).Millay writes of ecstasy, sorrow, loneliness, and the fear of time's ravages. This is a book that evokes ""arrogant laughter and sweet lust"" (XXXI), as well as ""the desirous body's heat and sweat"" (VII). The sonnet may be a centuries' old poetic form, but ESVM shows it to be still relevant and powerful."
3,Packaging could be better,The way it was shipped and packaged bent the letter to where I could not get the wrinkles out and it tends to affect the razor a bit.
1,Not a good choice for sharpening a razor.,When I received this as soon as I took it out of the package I noticed a very large gouge in the leather. The gouge was almost right in the middle of the leather. If i were to try and use this stop all i would be doing would be damaging my blade. The clasp to secure this strop to a hook is also very small and cheaply built. I was not expecting an amazingly built product for the price that I paid. However I could not even use this item. Perhaps you will have better luck with this then I did. I am returning it and looking for one again.
2,I wouldn't do this again.,"I purchase this before I knew anything about strops. I am still new but I can tell you that it arrived hard, almost brittle feeling. It had a huge gouge in it. Just to make it usable I had to sand the whole thing with 600 and 1200 grit and then apply a bunch of coats of mink oil. That was just the leather side. I am not happy with it. If I could do it again, I would stay away from this one."
2,maybe I'm missing something...,This strop needs to be treated or rubbed with something to be useable. Its way too tough and has some kind of coating or finish on it that's completely not necessary and now I'll have to remove it before I can use it.
5,great,got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. He uses it for everything from straight razors to knives. It gives a great edge.
5,Sweeney Todd,Bought to use as a stage prop for Sweeney Todd. Arrived in a timely and efficient manner. Never used to sharpen anything.
2,Decent PRACTICE strop,"I purchased this item before I knew what I was doing. The materials are very poor, I found many bumps and gouges in the leather. If you're going to buy it, use it only for stropping practice on a practice razor. Its simply not useful for anything else."
