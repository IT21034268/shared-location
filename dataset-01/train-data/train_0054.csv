3,Nothing new,"It's hard to beat the original since it was fresh and different during it's time, and it even held up as an entertaining movie for several decades. Although this version is much better than the 80's remake, it doesn't add anything new to the story. My family and I fast forwarded through a lot of the video and watched it in 1 hour. Technically it's a well done film, but so are the Star Wars movies. That isn't enough to make entertainment and I would have liked to see some twists as long as it was a remake of a classic. Otherwise what's the point of redoing it?"
4,A non-stop rollercoaster ride....,Ther CGI and live action come together really well. Some areas are a bit violent but realistic. Three hours of viewing adventure. Recommended.
2,"Too long, too sentimental, over-acted","Sorry, but this was a big disappointment... I had to split the viewing over too evenings to even get through it. The special effects are cool but the acting is over-done, the film is too long (said by someone who usually hesitates to buy a film that's under two hours) and several overly long and sentimental scenes and the music just kills whatever suspense they manage to build up. I couldn't wait for the anticipated fall of the ape so I could go to bed and read a good book instead."
4,Fun but not Classic,Not exactly Peter Jacksons best work but for what it lacks in acting and editing it makes up for in its CG and its fun action. On bluray it pops and u have yourself a fun popcorn movie.
3,Lacks Features,"The picture quality is obvious great and the Picture-in-Picture features are very nice, however overall it really lacks the same bonus material you'd find on a regular DVD such as Deleted Scenes, full movie commentary (the PiP is a combination of commentary and behind-the-scenes), and other things that most people have come to expect. If you want this movie and have an HD DVD player/drive it is probably worth it, as long as you understand what you're missing."
4,What? No commentary?!,"I absolutely LOVED this remake. I was a little dissappointed at how fake the CGI looked. But then I realized this was done by Universal and we all know how abyssmal Hulk was. But King Kong (the origianl 1933 version) was the movie that put the moviemaking bug into Peter Jackson's head. So this movie was a lifelong dream-come-true for him.The ONLY complaint I have about this DVD is the fact that it does not include a director commentary. I don't know about anyone else, but I love hearing a director's comments and thoughts. I love hearing what was going through his head when he made a particular scene. That's the only thing that would have made me give this DVD 5 stars."
5,Awesome!!,This movie is awesome. Great special effects and very good acting and directing. Rent or buy it today!
3,An hour too long,"What good are spectacular effects if you're asleep by the time they arrive?Ridiculously poor editing makes this a third longer than it should be. So many long pans over lavish sets as if to say, look at all the effort we went to, instead of trying to tell the story and move it along. Major continuity issues surface at various points to add to the mess.Some stunning visual moments, but in the end I didn't care as I was bored stiff an hour in and realizing more than two were left. Some really B-movie moments, too. Cheesy script and not one exceptional performance add up to snoresville in my book, even if the ape came off the screen and sat beside me. He'd start snoozin' too, I bet."
1,Didn't work,"Really disappointed. The movie would not play at all, I have know idea why, but it just would not work.I tried my Blue- ray player and even my ps3."
5,Exciting Movie!,"Saw this video on tv, and bought it for our grandsons. Great movie, lots of excitement, and they loved the dragon encounter!"
3,"Long, not a lot of dialog for length",Special effects are good. Story makes you use your emotions but is too long. See it once and that's enough but do see it once to say you've seen it.
5,King Kong HD-DVD,Possibly the highest video quality HD-DVD that I've seen. A definite addition to any HD-DVD collection.
5,I love this movie.,"well, I just got this HD version movie for my collection.I love it, and the HD version is even better than the regular DVDs. The picture quality is awesome."
3,The reason I gave it only 3 stars.,"There was a couple of big reasons.The first one was the movie took to long to build up to the action, and the main character.The second was Jack Black as dramatic actor is not believeable.The backgrounds and special effects were good but overpowering at times.One of the good things about it was the kept it back in the pastand that they kept to the story."
3,Got it early.,"I got this movie early with my Xbox 360 HD-DVD drive. I give it 3 stars not because of the picture quality but becuase the movie its self is only ok. Its kind of long for my taste, the whole part with the dinosours unnessary, and could be cut to make the movie shorter."
3,not quite sure how I feel,"First, the good stuff. OK, incredible CGIs. OK? Great monkey, great island,etc, etc. Loved the cast except for Jack Black (who I generally love). I had a hard time accepting him in this role. Bugs were great, tribe was great, boat was great. See, the pieces of the puzzle were all really nice pieces but somehow they didn't fit together. Since I thought the movie was already about 30 minutes too long, I can't believe they're putting out an extended version. Why? So we can see more of a love interest between beauty and the beast? Too much of a chase scene through New York.I believe what worked in the LOTR trilogy didn't work as well here. Still love Peter but, like everyone else in the known world, would love to see him take on the Hobbit."
2,Not Jackson's best work,"I felt that King Kong did not live up to Peter Jackson's previous works, Creatures, Frighteners, LOTR, and was at times filled with too long of V Rex fight scenes as well as death and looking scenes. The pacing was slow after the first hour and it became less interesting until the end of the film. Although the energy of the first hour was building it up, it failed to deliver what was promised from the strength of the opening of the film. It would be a good film to sit at home with on a rainy day when you have a lot of free time that you don't know what to do with, but it is very different than what he has done before."
2,No Deleted Scenes !?!,"Look closely before purchasing. There are NO deleted scenes on this 2-Disc Widescreen set. Just another load of decent, but redundant documentaries. And on Disc One, the movie has car commercials and previews right up alongside the film in the menu. Very shoddy and shameless. For this amount of money, there should be no ads. And in this day and age, putting out an ""Exclusive 2-Disc Special Edition"" with no deleted scenes is highway robbery and flim flam. I'm assuming that PJ will be back to the well for some hideous Extended Edition months from now. But until then, he now outdoes only George Lucas for holding us hostage for deleted scenes."
3,"Could have been great, but way overdone","First let me say that the character Kong was AMAZINGLY realistic onscreen. No effort was required to suspend disbelief in this improbable character. Kong himself was completely believable.Other special effects, however, were not handled with the same skill. The scene with the dinosaur stampede, fighting the t-rexes while suspended in vines, and the scene in which one character shoots numerous large insects off of another character with a fully automatic carbine without injury to the other character were so implausible they nearly ruined a movie that could have been truly great.Jackson's special effects are so overdone, you never feel that the characters are in any real danger even amidst dinosaurs' gnashing teeth, rocks crumbling beneath their feet, or while clinging too the feet of giant bats. In my opinion, Jackson got too carried away with his digital effects."
2,"Overlong, slack and indulgent","Some thoughts:- It is possible for a movie to have too many dinosaurs. Who would have thought?- Jackson's command of spectacle is immature. He got away with it in the first two LORD OF THE RINGS films because Tolkien's story and characters were so powerful. But cracks of obvious indulgence appeared in RETURN OF THE KING, and they open into a yawning chasm in KONG. (Literally, yawning.) Spielberg fell into the same trap with 1941.- Digital special effects have lost their magic. This isn't entirely Jackson's fault, but KONG makes it painfully obvious. Anything that can be imagined can be now shown. The question is, who has the talent to imagine something fresh and new?"
5,King Kong,Package arrived on time and was in new condition. My 4 year old cousin watched it twice back to back. lol.
2,Boring,"I am a big fan of the original King Kong, and maybe that's the problem. The new version of King Kong follows the original very closely ( maybe too closely ). Other than the special effects, there was nothing really very original to be found in the remake.I saw the remake in the theatre, and all I could think of by the time he climbed the empire state building was, can you hurry up and kill the ape so I can go home. Sorry, it was a real bore, and a big let down, not unlike the remake of the fog."
2,boring and too long,"This is another garbage movie from Hollywood. Terribly boring, violent and way too long. The only thing that saves this film from deserving the worst rating possible are the excellent special effects. This movie belongs among the C.R.A.P. productions along with ""the day after tommorrow"", the sequel to ""pirates of the caribbean"", the latest ""batman"", ""charlie's angels"" and many others."
4,Is this Bluray King Kong the extended movie version ???,"is this Bluray - King Kong the extended movie version ???In Singapore, King Kong bluray - Asian is extended version, but i wanna buy from Amazon..."
2,Good cause it played,2 stars.1 Star cause it worked1 Star cause I liked the movie before I bought this-3 Stars because it is SOOO sharp and picture is so clear. You can always tell Kong is CGI when in a scene with a live actor. I just wouldn't recommend anyone buy the HD or Blueray version of this. However the Dino vs Kong Scene is freaking awesome.
4,cutting board,I gave this to my daughter for her birthday and she loves it! She uses it everyday! It fits right in with her kitchen decor!
4,Beautiful cutting board,"I was looking for a good quality very thick cutting board that was dark wood and stainless steel trim so I could leave out on my counter all the time and it would look nice. I found it, this is exactly what I wanted and I proudly leave it out for everyone to see next to my new knives in a matching block. Looks like a chef kitchen to me. I keep it in tip top shape with special conditioner designed for wood that is food safe. The handle on one side is just slightly bent, most people wouldn't notice, but I'm very pickey and notice what others usually would not...otherwise I'd give it 5 stars."
1,Never Received!,"I ordered the Cutting Board from Amazon, my account was charged and it never arrived.After receiving no communication from Amazon or Knife Depot . . . I called Knife Depot and they informed me that the item had been shipped and they would be happy to track the shipment for me.I received a call later that day informing me that the item had been returned to them ""damaged"" in shipment and that they did not have any more cutting boards of the design I ordered in stock. I was also encouraged to reorder another cutting board. Knife Depot credited my account for the purchase price and shipping.I have no problems with Knife Depot and have since ordered a replacement cutting board from them, but hope in the future they will be more pro-active about informing customers when their is a problem with an order."
3,a little contrived,"A good read for the 10-12 age group. However, some of the characters were fairly unbelievable stereotypes. I wish they had been given more depth."
3,"the idols of monty python.. odd, one tune i recognized a link between the two... a study on mentors/idols","i would recommend this product to people who want to listen to those that inspired monty python.it is odd. it is interesting. i would not fully recommend it unless a diehard fan/social/historical interest kind of person.i'm glad i got to hear it, but may not for a while to come yet again:)if you had to choose between two close purchases and limited monetary supply, choose the other:)"
5,A MUST READ!!,"WOW, WOW, WOWThis book has been a life change for me! WOW!!A must read if your interested in obeying the calling placed on your life."
4,Excelent for the Mobile Dev.,Its a great book for those who initiate on the mobile developement. It gives a nice start for building WAP pages for the mobile industry.We work as the head of a mobile aggregator/integrator and we use this when we begin in the bussiness.
2,Just OK,"I disagree with the other review on this. It's not in fact built like a tank. So, the ""substantial"" weight of this product is in the iron grate only. The copper basin is about as thin as it probably could get. I'd say it weights 2 pounds or so. In fact, mine arrived with a large dent which, thanks to the thinness, I could push back with one finger. It's overpriced for what you get, but appears to be functional for a patio. I'd say get the screen because the grate is flush with the top of the copper bowl, so the logs will have nothing to contain them if they tumble out. To me, this is a $150 Pier One Imports quality item"
1,Books delivers no good examples!,"Yes, the first chapters are good. Yes, they explain the the way sockets work. But, does this book give a single concise example ... NO! The book has reviews online and on the back of the book, which state, ""No prior knowledge nessecary,"" and ""Great for Beginners!"" Well I've written network code on UNIX before and I have some limited experience on NT; but I couldn't figure out the books examples. Not to mention I had a hell of a time getting the projects off the CD-ROM and into a workspace. (I was never able to convert the projects, I could just get the *.cpp and *.h files) All in all, this book is not for someone who with little experience."
4,Excellent introduction in concise easy to understand format,Murphy tackles the material with a no nonsense and very business-like approach. An excellent introduction. Highly recommended.
2,"""Armchair theology""","The chief benefit I found in reading this book was that it opened my eyes to new categories of thought when contemplating religion in Cambodia. It caused me to take seriously the matter of the Buddhist nuns; showed me the existence of various cults and powerful spiritual figures that mix Buddhism and animism; informed me about some key figures in Buddhist history in Cambodia, and led me to consider how Cambodians abroad interact with religion here in Cambodia today.Major disappointment: the book did not teach much about real Buddhist belief, and, what it did say was obviously arrived at through the ""armchair theologian"" approach to studying a foreign culture. After having lived here 11 years I can see through much of what these authors are saying as merely speculation and politically driven academia rather than a reflection of what Cambodian Buddhists really believe and think about in their daily lives."
5,excellent collection of essays,"This collection of essays covers some of the key aspects of Buddhism in Cambodia today and their historical context. A really first class publication with reliable information not found elsewhere. The primary focus is on contemporary Cambodia. Well produced, well written, well priced. Highly recommended."
3,"Interesting juxtapositions - some successes, some failures","As is to be expected from Anne Carson, the breadth of her knowledge results in thought-provoking writing even when it fails as ""poetry"". An example Hopper:Confessions begins with a quotation from Edward Hopper, followed with 9 separately title poems accompanied by quotations from Augustine's Confessions, and ending with a piece by Hopper.Her essay on female pollution in antiquity is excellent scholarship made enjoyable reading for the ""common reading"".Several pieces, or portions of pieces, consider Lazarus raising interesting issues from the perspective of Lazarus ... what is his reaction at being called forth (rotting?) from the grave?While many of the pieces, especially the very short pieces, are not impressive, the book is worth your time - for the reflections it provokes in the reader."
1,A Slip-Up,"I don't know what happened here but Carson's last two books have really gone down hill. Men in the Off Hours, her first book since Autobiography of Red, is a mess. I don't know how else to describe it. It's not that I'd expect an easy read after her last book--just a consistent one. There are poems in here that first appeared in prose elsewhere and now are in lines! This suggests a lack of understanding of the line and its history and uses on the part of the writer, which shocks me since Plainwater and Autobiography of Red I truly liked.I would not suggest this book if you like Anne Carson. It will disappoint you!"
1,very droll,"I understand the attraction to Anne Carson. I like experimental poetry, too. I like scholarship. But this book is pointless. The poems are so terrible that by the time I got to the essay at the end about hot & cold symbolism for the writers of antiquity I was so upset with the book that I just couldn't care about anything in it. These poems don't sound good. If nothing else, there should at least be the sound. & in any other respects, the experiments are to no end in themselves. I recommend forgetting this book & going for such progressive, ambitious younger poets as Karen Volkman & Brenda Shaughnessy."
3,"Multipurpose, but the connector is weak","I bought this Reader cum Pen Drive because I have some SD cards for my camera which are kept unused for most of the time. So I thought, instead of buying a pen drive, this would make more sense. It worked well for the time it did, but a slight push when it was connected and the internal connections fell apart. Ideally most USB devices have that much of resistance, but this one disappointed.But if you are careful enough, its a good device to own. Saves the extra pen drive.-Nikhil"
5,Fantastic Device,"This product is a great value. Simple, inexpensive, easy to use. I primarily use it for SD cards and it works great. I highly recommend."
2,Read ONLY,"This card did not work as a Writer. Worked OK as a Reader. Read SD and SDHC cards on both Mac and PC platforms using Cards that are known to read and write on other readers. Permissions on the cards appeared to be ""READ ONLY"" on both platforms. Tried moving the the ""lock"" tab on the SD and SDHC card with same no-write results. No software or downloads available to correct this problem. If you go to Sabrent.com, the card is listed as a ""reader"" only. Sabrant.com -- model: CR-SDMMC -- Descripation: 26 in 1 USB 2.0 SD/SDHC/MMC/RS MMC Single-Slot Card Reader. This card is a rip-off as a card writer. For a card reader only device, the price is right. Do not expect to delete content nor re-format your cards using this device -- after you have read your card. I can not explain how other people claim their card ""writes"", however, Sabrant makes no claim this device is NOW a writer."
1,Didn't work with SD card,"I purchased this item along with a 2GB SD card to use with my desktop computer. The desktop recognizes the reader but says there is no media. I took the SD card out and put it into my laptop's built in reader and it immediately found the card and showed 2GB of free space. So the card is fine, but the reader is DOA."
2,not a string quartet,"I really don't know how to review this product. Except to say that I wanted the string quartet, and this popped up and I bought it, but it was a version transcribed for string orchestra. I generally love Dutch recordings of classical music, but if you want Beethoven's String Quartet, *this is not a quartet* !! I was stupid, but I also felt misled. I don't really know what the point is in recording Beethoven's String Quartet in C Sharp Minor transcribed for string orchestra. Isn't the point the particular puissance of the string quartet?"
4,Require for liturgical ministers and RCIA leaders,"Each chapter in this book is divided into sections: ecclesial documents, theology, praxis and conclusions. Chapters cover: church building, altar, ambo, presidential chair, baptistry, tabernacle, candles, vestments, oils, and confessional.While this may sound like dull reading, Boyer's use of the dedication rites to establish the symbolism surrounding the liturgical environment ""things"", make this an interesting and useful read.I especially recommend it for liturgical ministers, religious education leaders and RCIA leaders i.e. for those called upon to interpret the symbols by their actions or explain the symbols to others"
4,very good album...,my fav songs are...#2 - rumble young man rumble#3 - oh yes (even though it may be played out by now)#8 - make it work for you (very good song)#9 - whatever you wanna call it#16 - kid is back#18 - i am crack (hot banger)#21 - daddy (hot beat)the other songs are good except for some i could skip...
4,I'm Impressed,"I'm not the biggest Dipset fan but do frequently pick up some of the releases (mainly cos i like cam), when I got the new Juelz I found out what Dipset has been missing. Juelz has significantly stepped up his lyrical game since his debut. On a couple of tracks he tells stories ""lil boy fresh"" & ""gone"" are two very good stories warning youngsters of the dangers of the streets. On ""changes"" Juelz is consious and contemplative offering his look at what is wrong with the world at the moment. Probably the best cut on the album is ""daddy"" where he raps to his son, telling him his worth and prommising to take care of him.For the usual Dipset fans there are enough nursery rhymes on here but are listenable thanks to hot beats (thanks to no-name producers) and Juelz's charisma and flow. ""I am crack"" & ""Mic check"" are also infused with cleaver punchlines that i did not expect.Juelz surprised me and the game has been missing a mainstream artist spitting this well."
5,CRACK FO'SHIZZLE - YEA !!!,"THIS IS THE HOTTEST ALBUM EVER !!! I LIKE HOW HE PLAYS WITHWORDS - I LIKE HIS RHYMES - I LIKE THE BEATS !!! DON'T WAISTYOUR TIME WITH LAIM RAPPERS, GET THIS CD NOW - I SAID NOW !!!AND DON'T FORGET TO BRING THE KIDS TO BED !!! THE ONLY THINGI'M MISSING IS A SONG WITH J.R WRITER AND A SONG WITH SAS !!!THAT'S IT - THANX JUELZ !!! SEE - U EVEN GOT A LOT OF FANSIN GERMANY..."
2,Lame,"Santana Has no Lyrics. All He says Is Im Crack and Dipset. With oNly 4 good songs that not enough to buy the album but download it instead.There It Go,Oh Boy,Mic Check, and Make it work for u. Make it work for u being the best since it has THE BEST RAPPER ALIVE WHEEZY BABY IN IT and also young jeezy whos good at lyrics like lil wayne. Maybe Juelz should copy real rappers Like WHEEZY and Jeezy. BIG UPS TO CARTER 2"
1,GOING DOWN,New York and the entire east caost need to give it up the south is in the house and a southern take over is at place. Come to my hood and witness an underground movement headed mainstream in the rap game like no other...
3,pretty good,"I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this album,but Juelz Santana did pretty good. now if He would trim the extra stuffings,&get a few better beats in place then he just might be on his way. this Album has some bangers&it's cool."
5,DIPSET,The Best CD of 2005. The DVD is awesome as well so get the one with the DVD. Keep it Dipset!!!!
1,Amatuer rap album,"If saying ""Dipset"" at the beginning of every song and repeating words over and over around 5 times in a row is your thing, then yeah this is a great rap album. Otherwise, more senseless garbage with laughable 12 year old lyrics."
5,What The Game's Been Missing,"Juelz Santana's sophmore effort is one of the best album of 2005.It has a bit of everything,from songs for the street to club anthems to even a couple songs for the ladies.The first single ""The Whistle Song"" is solitifying Juelz in the rap game and making himself more well known.The second single off this album ""shottas"" is a pretty good song but shouldn't really be a single IMO. ""Oh yes"" is a good club anthem that is very catchy and i expect will be a single as well.Other standout tracks include ""Change"", ""Rumble Young Man Rumble"" and even ""Clockwork"" standouts although it has a fairl dull beat.This cd is one of the top 5 of the year so far with no fillers.Juelz will be a force in the rap game very soon."
5,AYE!!,"I was expecting a great album, but not this great. I cant think of one song on it that I don't listen too. I listen to the album everyday. Juelz really out did himself with this one. It's Dipset b**ch, AYE!"
5,Back Like Cooked Crack Baby !,"It's a bit less then what I expected but hands down this is one of the best albums of 2005. The punch lines, beats and guest appearances he did his thing. The album is crack and the boy is back."
3,"1 star for the lyrics, 2 for the beats.","""First, let me take time to brush my shoulders off/Wait... I had to dust my shoulders off ""I like Juelz's attitude but I just can't put up with this crap. This is the type of stuff that you'll be hearing for like 80% of the album. The production, I admit, is dope. But this is rap we're talking about here, a style where the poetry is more important than the rythms. And this is what makes this CD interesting enough to listen til the end. On ""Daddy"" and ""Lil' Boy Fresh"", we can see that Juelz can have a bit of lyrical potential when he wants to. Which puts him in the ""aight"" rapper category. Do yourself a favor: since you're already on Amazon, search for ""Hieroglyphics"", ""Deltron 3030"", ""MF Doom"", ""Jedi Mind Tricks"" or ""Immortal Technique"". Give those a listen, come back and tell me if you still want to give Santana those 5 stars I've been seeing on the previous review pages."
4,found what the game's been missing,"santana's album is titled ""What the game's been missing""Apt title since his latest release has braught a sense of a new flow to the game. His entire style is different from others and his originality is to be commended.with appearances from cameron, Sizzla, and many others, santana's album will have you hooked from the first track to the very last."
1,bootylicious,"This album is straight garbage yo. This cat is *not* representing Harlem, B. If you want something alot closer to Harlem, chek out your man Vordul Mega's album."
1,One of the worse rappers beside Tony yayo & the rest of the gay unit b itches,"Juelz santana's ""what the game's been missing"" is horrible. Production wise, lirical wise and over all just plain wack. Okay i give these weak rappers chances but they are truly wack! Juelz santana's rhymes does not make any sense and he proved that on his ""santana town"" song if you payed any close attetion to that song ? You'll hear bunch of nothing.I quess the mainstream mtv audience will get buy anything as along as its ""pop"" and ""cool"" what a shame. Dipset, gay unit, and these mtv2 rappers are whats killing the real hip hop and rap music nowdayz. By the way Juelz santana if your reading this ? Remenber ""chu chu train"" thats one of your lines ni gga! How can you call yourself a rapper? Well i quess even if lil john is a consider a rapper & a real producer anything is possible right ? Krs one would destroy your none sense rhymes in a second dude.Just my opinion. Peace out!"
1,Juelz should be missing his tongue,"Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money."
4,Light but entertaining,"I rather like Lynda LaPlante's stories and writing, particularly her Trial and Retribution police procedurals. Sleeping Cruelty is very different and not for those easily shocked. It's not a nice protrayal of the rich and how easily they can be manipulated by the amoral. A real page-turner."
3,Basically engrossing,"Unlike the three previous reviewers, who seem to have loathed this book, I rather liked it. The characters, particularly Justin and Laura Chalmers and Sir William Benedict, were well-drawn, their dialogue believable. The plot, beginning with Sir William's sponsorship of a promising politico, Andrew Maynard, builds up well. The only thing I found slightly unbelievable was the characters' opinion of Sir William as a fool. While they might disparage his origins and lack of ease in high society, any man starting from nothing to build a financial empire would be grudgingly acknowledged as having some sort of know-how. The ending itself was also weak, with the near psychotic Laura happily ensconsed on a paradise island with Sir William as her mentor, her dead but murderous yet still charasmatic brother Justin everpresent. The whole idea of Sir William's buying/developing the island might seem unlikely, but people who have lots of money can do and get most of what they want."
1,Worst book ever,"This has to be the worst book I have read in a long time. The plot is bad, the characters unbelievable (that's not unbelievable as in WOW - but unbelieveable as in just awful), and the writing really bad. I have read books by this author before and this one is such a let down. I am so angry at myself for reading to the end but even angrier at the author for writing such a bad book. The only good thing about it is that I borrowed it from the library rather than paying for it."
2,would've been great,"great looks and quality,BUT it was never mentioned that it was for women so the fit makes your finger really numb and hurt as soon as you wear them.perhaps consider 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wear."
4,good times,"This CD is really not that bad. Yes, Guttermouth does try to go back to their old Musical Monkey style, and they do succeed... sort of. This CD has fast songs with pop punk hooks, and they are for the most part pretty good. If you want a CD that sounds good and is enjoyable, check this out. If you want to be ""punk rock"" and be musically narrowminded, look elsewhere. Good songs: wasted lives, next faux mohican, season, NRAA. keep it real, yo."
1,the hell?,"the hell is this?...honestly, gusto and coverd with ants is actually better than this crap cd, atleast from the samples i listend to..they're trying to go back to their old style but its just crap...gusto and coverd with ants had some catchy pop punky tunes but this...its just crap"
5,Amazing!,So nice to go back in time and enjoy a feel good movie and actually have people wish everyone a MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!
5,I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas,"A beautiful classic Christmas movie. Love the songs, acting and the plot of the movie. This is a slight remake of ""Holiday Inn"" but my family and I like this one the best. It's an all star cast with star rated singers and dancers. This dvd is nice and the extras are fun.This isn't just a Christmas musical but also a romantic comedy. The chemistry between these actors are genuine. And I agree with my 83 year old grandfather about how this is what movies aught to be like. Movies to help make you smile and laugh, the ability to enjoy as a family and one that can become a family tradition to watch.This is a great classic with songs that everyone knows. I highly suggest this movie"
5,Favorite Christmas movie,"White Christmas has been my very favorite Christmas movie since my grandmother took me to see it as a brand new movie when it was first produced. The music, performers, scenery,etc. are great!"
5,Great Classic Christmas film!,"My family and I watched this Christmas day while it was snowing outside, and loved it! If you like Bing Crosby, then you'll enjoy this film. He and Danny Kaye are absolutely wonderful together. Danny Kaye keeps you cracking up the entire movie. Filled with great songs, and even some good dancing, ""White Christmas"" is the movie to watch during the Holiday season! So, grab a cup of hot cocoa, and enjoy!"
5,White Christmas dvd,The product was as advertised and arrived as scheduled. It suits the purpose for which it was ordered. Definitely would order again.
5,FANTASTIC MOVIE,"White Christmas"" was always my favorit all time favorite mivie. This DVD is truly great.It is really a clasic and I loved the two discHoliday Edition)"
5,I'm dreaming of.....,"Is christmas really christmas without ""White Christmas""? I watch this movie the first week in December every year. Nothing seems to put me in a better holiday mood than that gorgeous crooner Bing Crosby. Although the plot is not fabulous, the songs and the dancing are. I love the scenes of rehearsals and the performance. Danny Kaye is amazing, and the women are beautiful. Whoever said that there had to be a really strong story line with music and moves like this? The best part of the movie is the end...when they are singing ""White Christmas"" and it begins to snow. It reminds me of that first snow fall every year, in which magic and the holiday spirit meld to creat lasting memories. So grab your favorite afgan and a mug of hot chocolate and settle in to enjoy this wonderful holiday classic."
5,Memories,"As a person who appreciates the past, I like to renew old experiences through classic DVDs. White Christmas really brings back fond memories of the 40's for me. This White Christmas DVD is well done with clear video and great sound. The color is terrific. There are many hours of enjoyment for this viewer."
5,Favorite Holiday Film,"I first saw this movie when I was a senior in high school and like towatch it every Christmas over the past few years. Someone in my householduses ""closed captions"" on her regular TV programs. I can't seem to get theclosed captions to work even though the logo (CC) appears on the disk. Iam not crazy about sub-titles; they take more space and detract more fromthe picture I think.Can't figure out why the CC doesn't work. Any ideas?"
1,Amazon failed to respond to my email telling them I never the movie,"I never received this movie, which is normally one of my favorite Christmas movies. Amazon was notified but still charged me for nothing. I will never buy another movie from them."
5,great,my granddaughter lives out of state and i had this video when she comes to visit me so i bought one for you when she i home in wv. she loves this movie it is a classic she will watch it over and over again. she is only 10yrs. old
2,"WOMDERFUL MOVIES, BAD DISC!","I love both these movies and wanted to own them, and this set was priced cheap enough. But the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" disc was faulty and would only play about a third of the way through before freezing. After trying it on another dvd player and finally a brand new one,it still wouldn't play right,so I decided to send the set back and get a refund. I did not even try ""White Christmas"" as I had to return them as a set anyway. My money was refunded quickly, so no problem there. I cannot say that an exchange would have done the same, but I didn't want to have to bother with another return if it did. My guess is they are cheaply made. I will purchase movies separately in future at my local store."
3,Great Movie! Sound level poor.,The movie was great as usual but the low rating is due to the sound level. I had to bump up the volume 4 times the reg level.
5,Classic Christmas!,"What's Christmas without snow, snow, SNOW! Plenty of that to be had in both Christmas classics: White Christmas and It's a wonderful life! The family tradition in my house since I was a young girl was the night we decorated the tree, watch White Christmas and have hot chocolate and cinnamon buttered toast. And who doesn't want to see an angel get it's wings and find ""Zuzu's petals"" over and over again. That's not a question. It's a fact. Now I'm 55 and my kids are grown and we still cry when the retired General comes in and all his platoon line up to sing ""we'll follow the old man wherever he wants to go!"" I know I will be until I'm 95!"
5,It's A Wonderful Life,"This is an awesome and timeless classic for the entire family. Just when you think you're life isn't going so well, watch this movie and it reminds you of what really is important in life. I recommend it highly and it's a great addition to your movie library."
5,White Christmas DVD,received on time. was a replacement for soon to be mother in law who lost her copy in our house fire almost 2 yrs ago. realized we dont have a copy of so will probably purchase another copy of this after the first of the year.
4,Perfect,"Showed up on time and in perfect condition. Couldn't ask for more. However, if your looking for a bunch of special features, this isn't the place. It's the movie + a few special features but that's it."
5,Love this movie,"I love this movie and when I received it, it is in great shape. It has made a great addition to my collection."
5,White Christmas,"I watch this movie religiously every year on Christmas Eve. This is my favourite Christmas movie of all time! The costumes, the songs, the dancing, the snow! Watching this totally puts me in the holiday spirit. I reccomend it for anyone ages 1-99."
5,WONDERFUL,"I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS CLASSIC EVERY YEAR!I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE. IT MAKES ME HAPPY AND LIGHT HEARTED.AS MANY TIMES AS IT IS ON TV I'LL WATCH IT.I AM A BIG DANNY KAY FAN AND I LIKE BING'S MUSIC. THIS IS A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE,OF ALL AGES.THE COLOR IS GREAT AND THE MUSIC IS WONDERFUL EVERYTIME THE GENERAL ENTERS THE ROOM I CRY LIKE A CHILD! .IT WILL TEAR AT YOUR HEART STRINGS. SINCERELY SHARON COOK"
5,White Christmas (Blue Ray),The Classic movie from the 50's in Blue Ray was stunning. The vivid colors just seemed to stand out brilliantly. If you love this movie classic then you will enjoy what Blue Ray has done to enhance your viewing experience.
4,A Christmas Fave,"I love this movie and look forward to seeing it each holiday season. I recently learned that a co-worker had never seen it. How could that be?! So I purchased it for her as a Christmas present. It was new, appropriately packaged, and arrived in a timely fashion."
5,Who Doesn't Love a White Christmas,"One of the all time greats to put you in the holiday mood. The way it used to be, the way it should be. No hussle and bussle just peace on earth."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!,"i'm only 14 yrs. old and White Christmas is one of my favorite Christmas movies! you wouldn't think a kid would like ""oldies"" but i do! this one is the PERFECT Christmas film with a grand ended of . . .well if you haven't seen it I won't tell you.It is a fantanstic movie!!!!"
5,Wonderful Classic Christmas movies,"I thought ""It's a Wonderful Life"" would also be in color. I am fine with it in black and white though. I absolutely love both of these movies! We watch them every Christmas. ""White Christmas"" is played numerous times during the holiday season. Even my young kids like it. I think they did a wonderful job with the color version of it. The singing and dancing is amazing! I especially like how wholesome both of these movies are. This is what Christmas entertainment should be like!"
5,Replacing VHS,I bought these because I had worn out the VHS copies that I had and they are my two favorite Christmas movies. I watched them when they came in and there's no problem with them at all. I have no complaints about the product or the time of delivery.
1,Seriously?,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I've read several reviews stating this is a hallmark of Christmas movies and was shocked at how ridiculous and contrived it was. I asked my family to watch it on Christmas Eve and at 3/4 of the way through, proceeded to apologize to all of them for ruining their holiday.On another note, my service from Amazon was excellent - as always. Love you guys!"
5,One of the best holiday films EVER!,"This is in my top five favorite holiday movies! I love Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye! There aren't movies anymore where the actors can also sing and dance! I love it, the costumes are amazing; I love to sing along to the songs! If your'e just starting out your holiday movie collection, this should be on the top of the list!"
4,White Christmas - DVD,"The DVD arrived quickly in time in fact to view it on the 12th day of Xmas..Good seller, good product.."
4,Holiday Favorite,"This is a holiday favorite in our house. However, we watch it even when the holiday is gone. I has amazing actors like Bing Crosby and his wonderful voice. The story is sweet and definatley a favorite. I love old movies and this one is on the top of my list."
5,Awesome,My husband loves this movie. Every Christmas Eve after church we go home and pop popcorn and watch this movie. Our family tradition.
5,White Christmas - a year round classic!,"Another one of our holiday favorites, we will now be able to watch year round. This is a fantastic family film with great values."
5,impressive in blue ray,"Just when you thought Bing couldn't impress you more, you see him in Blue ray. You almost see too much detail. How do they do it?"
3,White Christmas Repackaging,"This is a great Christmas and family classic. I love this movie and don't know of anyone personally who doesn't.However, as a fan of this movie, I must comment that I'm happy to see this movie come out in a collection seperate from the dreaded label of ""WIDESCREEN COLLECTION"" that many Paramount movies possess. Why Paramount was doing that to all their movies is beyond me, but over the last few months, they've begun to stop.However, this does not mean the DVD is a new release. This IS the exact same DVD release originally printed in 2000. The cover and slipcover are the only new features of this release. If you're like me who's anal retentive and wants to get a fresh crisp copy that's decorated only with words and art from the movie, this exchange may be worth the extra $10.00 or so, but only for that reason. If you already have the 2000 release and you're happy with it, this exchange would serve you no justice."
5,CLASSIC GOODNESS,Huge Stars! WONDERFUL MUSIC!! You really must watch this classic with your family and join in the singing and dancing! What's not to love about Bing and Danny!
5,White Christmas,This should be a must for every household. It is an excellent Holiday film all the family can watch and enjoy.
5,White Christmas DVD,I love this movie. It is one of my favorite Christmas movies. Thanks for having it available to buy it.
5,Excellent kick-off to Christmas!,The DVD is of excellent quality and I will enjoy it again and again. May all your Christmases be white.
2,Only one movie is colorized...,"I bought this set because I wanted It's a Wonderful Life in Color on DVD and the product review stated it was in color. Only White Christmas is in color, which I didn't even want! Because I waited too long, I could not return it, I guess that was mybad:( Oh well-still watching the VHS colorized version in PA!"
2,"Movies ok, but....","The movies were great and what I wanted, with one exception... In the description it states that they are in color, where in fact ""White Christmas"" is in color but ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is not. That is the only gripe that I have about this duo-set. I have been trying for several months to get a copy of the colorized version of ""It's A Wonderful Life"". I saw this advertized as color and ordered it. I received it and watched the movie, only to find out that it is not in color, but in fact black & white. I am very disappointed of this fact."
1,Terrible transfer: bad color alignment and often audio sync issues.,"Unfortunately the DVD I purchased is worse than my aging VHS copy of this wonderful film. The color on this copy is out of alignment, resulting in a double film image (a separation between color and black-and-white). Bing's ""baby blues"" are lower than were they're supposed to be and hairlines (especially in the beginning when the men are in uniform) have a large color gap where you can see black and white (almost as if this were a colorized black and white film). I also had some trouble with the audio sync. I may have a bad copy, given all the good reviews but clearly this DVD is unwatchable! Big disappointment. I am returning it for a refund."
3,Does not say Anniversary Edition on the box,DVD is okay but I ordered it as a surprise for my husband because it was an anniversary edition. I returned the first one I received because it did not say anniversary edition on the box like it does in the picture of the item. I reordered and got the same thing. I kept the second one because I needed it for Christmas. A bit of a disappointment but if you don't care about the box then you should be happy with the DVD.
3,A little disapointed,"I was a little disapointed when i opened this package and found the case was paper thin, like those old cartoon dvds u can buy for a dollar, but other than that all was well. still a good movie and in perfectly good condition."
1,Grainy quality/poor sound,"Couldn't watch the whole thing- kept stopping, poor sound, bad picture. I love this movie so hopefully Amazon will do something to fix this problem."
4,Christmas Classic,"A movie for all ages, I have been watching this movie since I was a kid at home. Now my kids watch it with me. It is a timeless classic right up there with It's A Wonderful Life and Miracle on 34th Street. Great singing and watching Danny Kaye dance is a treat for the eyes. Now I have a digital copy to go along with my DVD. Good time to be alive. Happy New Year!"
5,a great classic,A great classic with better picture sound and lots of extras. The package with its fake snow was is fun.
5,The best Christmas movie ever!,Fantastic movie! Bing was in his prime and the musical numbers are first rate!
3,widescreen,I always look for widescreen films and this is one of those. I like to see the entire screen the way it was filmed rather than part of the action cut off in strange places.
4,Nice to watch in HD,"I watch this Christmas movie every Christmas. The quality was good, But the streaming was a little grainy on playback."
5,Holiday Classic,Great holiday classic for the whole family. I love the songs and the show. Blu ray makes the colors pop on this old classic.
5,A Classic,Simply put this is one of the best Christmas movies ever made....if you enjoy a song and dance type movie. Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye are superb and supported by a really good cast. It is a must see for my family each year as it helps us get in the Christmas spirit with no fail.
3,Do Not Buy Digital Copy,"No question, this is a classic movie that my family loves to watch year-round. I was so excited to see it available for download. We initially watched it streaming and figured the pixellation was due to that. Not so! The download is just as bad. The color is bright and vivid, but it's so blurry we might as well just watch the old vhs. I'd stay away from the digital download and spend the extra to get the dvd version, I'm disappointed I didn't save my money and do just that."
3,not what I expected,"I love the movie White Christmas. It is something that I watched with my mom and my sister when I was a child... so I have huge expectations! My complaint is the fact that they chopped the movie down to fit the flat screen HD format and while it is better than the old ""full screen"" that was panned and scanned, they still cropped it. White Christmas was the first film made in the Vistavision format and that is how the director and cinematographer wanted the movie to be viewed and that is what I want to see when I watch it! So while the Blu-ray is crisp and the colors wonderful... I am going to go back to my widescreen DVD."
2,No Hoo-ray for blu-ray,"Disappointed with the Blu-ray ""quality"" of this movie. I've previously viewed VHS colorized versions of White Christmas that were near-equal to this Blu-ray version. Grainy and with little discernible HD effect. Pity."
2,White Christmas - Anniversary Edition,"White Christmas is one of my favorite Christmas movies. This DVD was a disappointment - the coloring was dark, it dragged and skipped. My VCR copy is a better quality and it is 10 years old."
2,Boring,"I love old movies, but am not a big fan of musicals. However, this wasn't even a very good musical in my opinion. Danny Kaye is brilliant in anything he does, and Rosemary Clooney was charming as always, but it seemed like the entire second half of the movie was dedicated to Vera Ellen's unremarkable dancing skills. The songs were kind of boring, and the dancing sequences in the second half are only mildly less interesting than a drum solo. The story itself could have been interesting, but they chose to spend more time on the dancing and singing than the actual story, so it felt like a lot was missing in the overall feel of the movie. I have not yet seen ""Holiday Inn,"" this movie's precursor (and from what I understand, pretty much the same movie), but I think I would still recommend that one over this, which seems more like a A-list sketch comedy than an actual movie."
3,White Christmas,I received the DVD I ordered and it works but during play there is high pitched noise that comes and goes through out the course of the movie. I wll not order another DVD from this site.
2,dvd is not readable for its a wonderful life!,"I ordered three dvd's one was the pair including ""Its a Wonderful Life"" and ""White Christmas"" White Christmas is fine but Its a wonderful life is 'NOT READABLE'- would you like it returned & how do I go about this?If it helps you track my order I also ordered ' ""A Christmas Carole"" with Patrick Stewart which is fine.Please advise how I can exchange the blank dvd for a good copy of 'Its a wonderful Life'.thank you, Nancy"
4,"Gives a wonderful, warm-hearted, happy Christmas feeling","It may be simplistic, but the old ones are best. Clean, good, warm-hearted movie set in the good old days when they all lived happily after.... and isn't that what we all want to see, really?"
4,A classic,"I have heard complaints about the weak and predictable story line of this movie, complaints about Crosby's parenting, even general dislike that goes with ""war-oriented"" movies.Disregarding all of these, I still love this movie. The music is great (though some appears in other places). The love story is predicatable (as in most movies of this era) but still enjoyable. The ending may be predictable (how many of these type of movies really had a surprise ending?) but still brings a lump to my throat every time I see it. Seeing all the guys marching in, thinking about how the General must have felt, still affects me.It's a great movie. Don't wait until next Christmas to see it."
5,Eternally charming movie!,This movie has always been my favorite. From the moment Bing Crosby first sings the title song until the very end...the humor and music are timeless! A classic in anyone's book!
5,A classic,My all time favorite Christmas movie. I can watch it over and over again. I needed to upgrade from a VHS to a DVD.
2,I'll stick with HOLIDAY INN,"Having seen HOLIDAY INN at least a dozen times, I realized that I'dnever seen its reworked version, WHITE Christmas until it showed up onTCM the other day. Aside from some great musical numbers (esp. thedance sequences) this was an overlong snore. The plot was so convolutedfor such little payoff -- all that secrecy/misunderstanding for theGeneral's surprise party. And nothing says ""Christmas cheer and warmth""better than a stage recreation of a bombed-out European landscape! Bycontrast, HOLIDAY INN, had a nicely paced inherent structure in itstelling of an inn open only on holidays and some truly memorable tunesand musical numbers. That film's atmosphere and warmth seemed genuineand not wrapped up in the false sentimentality and schmaltz of theremake. The only reason to buy a DVD of WHITE Christmas would be tohave the ability to skip to the dance scenes."
2,The critics are right -- this movie isn't very good.,"This is a subtle pro-war film that has nothing to do with Christmas. I can't believe Irving Berlin himself liked it. There are only a few things that make it worth watching. (1) Grady Sutton, who doesn't get nearly enough lines or screen time; (2) the quartet singing ""Snow"" in the dining car of the train; (3) the outfit Rosemary Clooney is wearing when she gets on the train as she ""runs"" away from Bing Crosby; and (4) Bing Crosby's apparent self-consciousness as he is undressing in front of Danny Kaye while being talked into following the girls (watch for it -- he hurriedly pulls his shirt down so the camera won't reveal the fact that he's wearing briefs!!!). Aside from all that, a real depressing movie."
3,White Christmas,I'm sure the product is fine (haven't opened it yet because it's a gift) but I'm sad that I got it over the internet now because I saw it at Walmart for 4 dollars cheaper! (I thought since it was an anniversary edition that it wasn't available in the stores so I didn't look-my mistake).
1,WAY OVERRATED...How is it so popular?,"I really have no idea how people consider this a ""holiday classic"". The photo on the cover is the best part of the movie. Really.Hard to follow storyline, I forgot it was a Christmas movie at all. It is mostly about glorifying the Army and war. I heard it was based on ""Holiday Inn"", a MUCH better movie and musical. I wouldn't waste my time on White Christmas.Idk if it was originally in BnW-the version I watched was ""update"" in color--but still was awfully dark and kinda depressing. There was no chemistry between the males and females, as there was in Holiday Inn, and most of the singing and dancing was solos done by one woman (and wasn't entertaining in the slightest), while Crosby and partner barely got screen time! What a waste!I can't help but wonder if there are fake reviews on this movie just to keep the rating high..for some reason."
2,Mostly singing,"This movie is hardly a movie, just a lot of singing and dancing with no actual storyline."
5,White Christmas,"Sorry, I'm late to voice my opinion. Very pleased regarding the total transaction. Happy New Year!!"
5,white christmas - blu ray,As always this our number one Christmas movie. We bought in Blu-ray for the clarity and sound and we were not disappointed. It was worth buying it even though we had a regular dvd of the film.
4,Great Holiday moive,My favorite Christmas moive which I will nver miss again. I can watch this all year round for music and acting
5,Classic Movie,A great old classic that leaves you feeling good at the end. It is perfect for the Christmas seasons entertainment.
4,Great holiday entertainmet,"Good holiday classic for a snow-bound family. This was my first experiment buying an Amazon movie to stream to TV. Quality was good, movie was entertaining. I do wish there was a way to actually download it to the computer or DVD for our old style TV that has no internet connection. It seems like all you can do is watch it again from Amazon."
4,a classic,a great holiday movie. not much really needs to be said about bing crosby. it's just a feel good christmas film.
1,Dreadful Christmas,"What a dreadful, horrid Christmas movie. It's slow, the characters sing ""Sisters"" until you want to slap them like red-headed stepchildren.The ONLY reason this movie gets one star is because the dresses that Rosemary Clooney and Vera Ellen wear at the end of the movie are gorgeous!Skip this one. If you want a good Christmas film, purchase Laurel and Hardy's MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS (a.k.a. BABES IN TOYLAND) or Pee Wee Herman's Christmas special!"
2,Abominable,These type of movies had little to do with Christmas other than making a quick buck.Not many people knew at the time that Bing Crosby was a child abuser. Three of his children would eventually commit suicide.
1,Very bad double feature,"It is much better to buy ""Holiday Inn"" in Color.""White Christmas"" with Rosemary Clooney has no plot and poor singing of almost the same songs as ""white Christmas"" Also beware of being sent triplicates and duplicates of CDs and DVDs"
1,WHITE CHRISTMAS,"This experience was TOTALLY UNSATISFACTORY!!! I received a notice that the product had been shipped; it included a very long number to trace the shipment. It was promised for February 6th, but did not arrive. On February 16th you wrote me that the shipment was never made. Now which is it? Did you have it, and misplace it in the process, or did you lie when you said it was already send out? I have had otherwise good results in my purchases from amazon, but this is a real mess-up. I wrote to ask how to reorder, and this is the only response since then. Is there anything you can do to change this problem.? Do you reprint reviews of your service?"
5,It's A Winner!!!,"This movie is a sheer collection of talent! Bill Crosby and the supporting stars have great voices and dancing. The story line is excellent, also. It has suspense, romance, comedy, and a touching ending. This movie is a great family film. I would definitely recommend this movie.."
5,Christmas standard for the family...,We watch this several times during the holiday season... know most of it by heart. Love the music and dance!
4,old time fun,the clasic from the 40's a family watch clasic music dance love story and good deeds abound in this bing cosby fav
4,Beware of false reviews,"I fell for the too-good-to-be-true ""review"" offering the ""free"" Char Broil grill on awesomestuffree/amazon. After clicking so-called free ads for 20 minutes I was brought to a page requiring me to sign up for 2 of 3 offers. Two of those were for auto loans, and to ""qualify"" I had to apply, get approved and be funded for the loan. Save your time and effort. The grill sounds great, but the fake review is inappropriate and should be removed."
4,easy to use,I have owned my Bistro for 5 years now. Overall it has been a good grill. It is easy to regulate the tempature and cook foods slow. If you want to maintain high heat you need to keep the lid closed as the grill takes a while to heat up. It takes about 25 minutes to reach searing tempature on a cold day.I have been through 3 tempature regulators in the 5 years I have owned the grill. This is the only reason I do not give it a 5 out of 5.
3,SheeBee,"Enjoyed this movie...very feel good, in my opinion. To follow your heart regardless of whatever seeming differences, obstacles, or pressures a couple might face. Because in the long run, it's just each other you have to face. Ms. Lathan does a very fine job of presenting the conflicts she faces. Mr. Baker is adorable and I had a hard time wondering what was taking so long for the two of them to get together."
3,Good Date Movie.,A cute movie nicely told. Love the actor who plays Sanaa's father. Hope to see more of him on the big screen.
5,Finally a movie about falling in love with a person..not a race.,"I really enjoyed this movie because it brings up many issues. I know that I have thought about them, but living around the world and dating many different races has made me conclude that dating is about the person. How is it that child can see people for who they are and not the colour of their skin or their ethnicity? This movie can remind many adults about what is important. I am sending a copy to a dear friend of mine who is in love, but she is struggling to get past many of the issues brought up in this very movie. Great work to the writers and director."
3,Quiet and Nice,"Enjoyable.The frank conversation between the main charaterswas great. More conversation was needed. The family connectionbetween Kenya and her Dad as well as Kenya and her brother was positive and comforting. More conversation was needed.I would like to read ""the book"" for more information onthe thinking of each charater yet I will buy the DVD."
5,Beautiful Movie,This story is very realistic. It shows that the perfect man (or woman) doesn't necessarily have to be the same skin color as you. I just love a good love story and this one is cute. Kudos to Sanaa Lathan!
2,it's ok,"Sanaa Lathan does a cool job in this film which is pretty predictable within the first half hour. the directing was all over the place. the story was cool&needs to be told more often,but this film felt real generic in alot of places. should have been way better because this a film that had a real story to tell&it ends up settling for alot of predictability. just Ok."
1,Not A Great Film,"I viewed this movie and was very upset when I saw how the black woman was depicted in this film, it was not a great film, or love story, just more un-natural sex, I hate race mixing!"
1,"DULL, SLOW AND DULL",Good premise but slow snail pace slow and dull. The acting is stiff and uncomfortable. The story line could have been interesting if they had decided it was a comedy or drama.I know black men dating white women is accepted but white men dating black women is still taboo so the movie had potential but it just doesn't make any magic happen. The two leads don't even act as if they are comfortable with each other. Donald Fasion was the comic relief and he was good...but he was the only good thing about this movie. Rent it don't buy it.
2,"FWBW = For Women , By Women",A total chic flick. No dude in his right mind would want to sit through this unless he was getting some at the end of the movie.
1,Lower than a star,"""Jungle Fever"" Reversed: ""Guess Who?""-It Ain't! The film's central character (Kenya) is having a hard time trying to find a good man to fall Guess What? She ended up falling love with a white guy (Simon). after that it was pure love all the way-But Note to Kenya: Don't take this to your fellow brothers and sisters; and Don't bring that Spiked Kool-Aid over to your next Family Reunion."
4,A sweet feel-good movie,"This was such a pleasant movie to watch. Lovely feel-good story, beautiful characters, lovely leading lady, handsome leading man, fine direction and production qualities. I loved that old truck Simon Baker's character, Brian, drove around in and the way he dressed in honest-to-goodness well-worn, dusty, work clothes. (Well, not the sox. They were working man's sox but seemed way too new. Still, very charming. A nice touch.) My only caveat was that Sanaa's character, Kenya, was not developed enough to understand the attraction Brian had for her beyond the physical. More should have been made, perhaps, of her father's stint as a doctor in Africa helping poor people - some conversation would have been useful that showed Kenya shared his values, which would have matched Brian's and nailed down his attraction to her. Get this DVD and watch it as an antidote to the dismal stuff we get in the news."
4,A movie that can be share w/the family,This movie is very sweet and says a lot of things that interracial couples have wanted to say for a long time. The contexts of the movie can be shared with all ages. I very much enjoyed the story line and most of all the ending. It's a wonderful movie.
5,Love in black & white!,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE! Both actors do a great job, and they are both just as attractive as the story! The buildup and tension was superb. The movie was an honest portrayal of both interracial relationships trials and tribulations, and the beauty that can come from a relationship that is more than skin deep. The cinematography was well done, as well as the script. It was at no point cheesy, like some other movies that venture down the romantic path. If you're looking for a cerebral, Oscar nominated movie, this is not the one for you. But if you like a well done, slightly romantic, honest, somewhat sensual movie, then you has clicked on the right film!"
3,Decent,"This is a descent romance, however, there seem to be a disconnect for me and the lead actors. While I saw why and how Bryan weedled his way into Kenya's heart, I never understood from his point of view what he loved about Kenya. He seemed to be the one doing all the giving and bending over backwards, but I never saw Kenya doing the same from him. What was it like to be around his parents his friends (did he have friends) and etc? In that sense the film felt one sided and I didn't buy into the romance as deep as I should have. Plus, the lead actors, in my opinion, totally didn't have any chemistry. It pretty much involved her looking pissed off and him being at a loss as to what he did now to piss her off. Half the time, I didn't even know. Overall, I like the movie's message about opening yourself up for more experiences--I just wished that Bryan had more layers to him."
5,I love Simon Baker!,There was a certain spark between Simon and Sanaa.The whole premise/story is believable.I have watched this over and overagain--maybe because of Simon!
4,Nice movie,"It's fun, it's romantic and it realistically explores interracial dating. I enjoyed it. If you are a fan of Simon Baker, you will enjoy seeing him in a role that is very different from his character on ""The Mentalist""."
4,rainy day movie,This movie is a great rainy day movie to watch. I like the main actors smile and want to see more. Simon Baker is cute. It's nice to see a clean movie with no durty words. This movie is for women who wants love and is willing to take a chance on another race.
4,Looking for something new,"I love this movie. Sanaa Latham is one of my favorites and Simon Baker is such a cutie! It is true that black women are less likely to date outside their race than say, black men. But, this movie sheds a little light on that situation and opens it up for more discussion - and consideration. It's entertaining and has some funny scenes. But, most of all, it's message of LOVE IS LOVE is universal."
2,A small defect is annoying,"My review is one which I take the blame for since amazon was never informed. The DVD has a small segment where it turns very slow as there is a defect. I decided to keep it because it is easy to not send the disc back. Amazon met all its obligations--sending the DVD on time,confirming the order and had the provision that I could sent the DVD back if there was a defect.I am pleased with the way they acted."
4,Love in Black & White,"In an era where we are seeing a spate of Tyler Perry taking over the marketplace for African-American comedies, this film is like a breath of fresh air. One can see why Alice Walker recommended it!! Good writing, believeable characters and an appealing duo of Latham & Baker make this one more watchable than any of Perry's movies. You will not see any buffoonery here or stereo-type characters that you would find in Tyler's films. These are sophiscated, urban class characters and for once my intelligence was not insulted!! There have been very few comedies that approach this subject without sensationizing it or being condescending about it (Lee's terrible ""Jungle Fever"", for instance). No one is a villain in this dramedy--they are only human. This is a perfect film for the Obama-Hillary camp!!"
5,"Well-written film, gotta see this one!","Something New starring Sanaa Lathan and the very sexy Simon Baker is a smart and engaging story of a successful African-American woman who falls in love with a white landscaper. Kenya McQueen (Lathan) thinks she has it all, a great job, a brand new home, and level-headed friends, but when one of her co-workers sets her up on a blind date, Kenya refuses to fall for him because he is a different race than her. Nonetheless, Kenya does find him attractive but is she willing to give in to temptation and what will her friends and priviledged family say when they find out she's dating a white man? I highly recommend checking this film out, one of the best and under-rated films of 2006. The film also stars Alfre Woodward and Donald Faison. Something New will have you longing for passion just like it did for Kenya. Enjoy!"
5,cute little chick flick - a fun romantic story,"This is a cute little movie - well acted and a delight to watch. One of those curl up on a couch, feel-good movies that is lovely to watch. It's wonderful to see a person learn about themselves and experience what a ""good"" man is versus an ""ideal"" man in the nick of time. Personally, I'd love to live the life this lucky woman chooses for herself. Love Simon Baker's easy smile....he's a KEEPER! The cinematography is beautiful. It is first and foremost a well done love story with some serious eye candy ..."
4,In 3 words: Suberb. Important. Potent.,"Those expecting Pimp 2 will be a little dissapointed in this book. But don't click away yet! Iceberg continues his deeply personal writing as he tells us many short, diverse stories in this book in his unmatched style. Some are about his pimping days, some answering questions people ask him about pimping, one touching letter to his father, other essays are strikingly raw as Pimp ever was - but they are about issues that concern him deeply: racism and politics in the United States. And they are the voice of a man who has been through it all. The most important voice of all, perhaps.Those seeking another follow-up book to read after Pimp discussing the same topic will love Iceberg's new bookIceberg Slim: The Lost Interviews with the Pimp"
5,Unraveling The Mystery,"Well written and highly readable, this book is nothing more than a superb attack on the prevailing orthodoxy that passes for history today. Parenti pulls no punches and is not afraid to be politically incorrect. His savage attack on the conservative historians, their biases and their sacred cows will raise the eyebrows and the blood pressure of those who want their past prepackaged like junk food, made to look good, taste good and slowly poison the society it misrepresents. It will terrify those who believe that are ancestors were greater and wiser than we are. This is a book that should be read by every intellectual, regardless of bias. It will astound as well as entertain, and for those of a conservative bent, it will probably appall. The best sections deal with the excesses of the Church as a destructive and distorting agent in history, Viva La Revolution!"
5,"Good book, eye opening!","OK, you've probably read all the other reviews by now so I won't repeat what they said, but I wanted to point out that his review of some of the myths of the church may offend some people, or at least shake them up. It was an eye-opener for me, especially as I'd just been reading St. Augustine prior to this book. But it explains a lot too and for me at least became reassuring that things aren't on a path to destruction, history has just been whitewashed. This book will offend some tho, but probably by saying the ugly truth."
4,Book,I ordered a used book and it was what I ordered. I received it on time and it was in an ok condition.
4,A Fun Book!,"[...] While the outcome might be predictable to you, in the eyes of a child it's probably not.We got this book out of the library, have had to renew it several times. My 4 year old daughter enjoys this book. She enjoys the expressions by both Beatrice and her brother Henry. This book has become part of the bedtime routine for over a month.I will say that as a parent I found some of the illustrations to be off. On the page where Beatrice finds herself in the children's room, the character Wanda does not look really interact with Beatrice in the illustration.The story is enchanting; however, the illustrations could be a bit more accurate in depicting what is happening in some instances."
5,sharpest knives,these knives are so sharp & cut through everything wonderfully. the scissors are great also! love the color...just one of the best purchases ive made lately! would highly recommend them to anyone that needs a basic knife set!! they are great!!!
4,you get what you pay for.,"Had hoped the chefs knife would be heavier,much less flex. But for the price I got what I paid for."
4,Great for a casual chef or first apartment!,"If you're after top-of-the-line, culinary-school-graduate knives, this isn't the set for you. If you're just starting out and want a nice assortment of knives and a nifty block to store them in, I highly recommend this set. The chef's knife has a nice weight to it. My roommate says she'll never live in a kitchen without kitchen shears again - and having them on the counter is so nice! The eight ""steak knives"" aren't serrated like most steak knives, which is very handy for me - those knives work well for prep, serving, and eating everything from peppers to pumpkin pie to chicken breast."
2,Kitchen Aid Quality slipping away,"I bought these knives on a Friday amazon sale and thought I was getting something pretty good. Instead, I got some very plastic cheesy looking knives. The steak knives look like they cost about 99 cents each. The rest of the knives are pretty good and very sharp. They cut well and have good balance. I was just really dissapointed with the steak knives as all the other knives are of good quality."
1,"I thought kitchenaid was a good name,was I wrong",I just recieved my knife set 4 days ago.Last night a knife was left in the sink and it rusted.What is up with that.I would recommend not getting this product.The knife set I had at $60.00 never rusted in the 10 years I had them.Shame on you kitchenaid for selling bad products.
4,Great product from KitchenAid,Very attractive design. Comfortable to use. Great knife set for the money. Fits in great with my kitchen which is furnished with KitchenAid appliances.
2,Cheaply made.....,"Thanks China for another inferior product on the shores of our great nation. This thing is junk. Won't stay lit, so cheaply made it is scary to use."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this grill so that I could grill veggies and fish outdoors without the fuss of charcoal. But I have tried chicken fajitas and calamari on skewers, and both times the grill didn't get hot enough. I had to finish them both on the indoor stove. Next time I'll research better before shopping."
4,great little grill for the money,it's a great little grill if you know how cook on a grill what do you expect for 30 dollars i have enjoyed the grill
4,Good BBQ,"This is a good little propane bbq for camping or RVing. It doesn't take up much space, and is inexpensive."
2,Don't try using this at the beach or anywhere windy,"I picked this up at Home Depot figuring it's a char broil how bad could it be for $30. Put it together at home, tested the system for leaks and electronic ignition seemed to work fine. Took it to the beach the next day. It was a little breezy....would not spark/light difficult to attach and then when I finally manually lit it it took forever to heat up and would only cook on high....and I was just heating up hot dogs....heaven forbid trying to cook chicken. When finally warm, the heating is very uneven.I guess I'll put it in my earthquake kit to use only in an emergency."
1,Dangerous,"This grill was difficult to light, would not stay lit when the least bit windy, and needed to be run at high or near to high. Consequently, when grilling some chicken, the entire grill caught fire. The handle on the far side from the gas bottle started initially and then the paint on the body burned. Flames shot up two feet. I was able to disconnect the gas before the burning paint reached that side. Needless to say I was terribly concerned."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought one of these to use for car camping. It's OK for hotdogs and (thin) burgers, but forget about pork chops or chicken. It either wouldn't stay lit or wouldn't get hot enough if the wind was blowing a little.I replaced it with the Weber Q and couldn't be happier."
3,Ok grill (for the price),"You get what you pay for (sometimes at least). This grilloperated as advertised. One nut came without threads makingthe assembly kind of a pain. The handles get very hot and the dialis upside down making if difficult to see the heat setting. Also,the grill rack is much flimsier than in grills I've had in the past."
4,Charbroil table top grill,I bought this grill for my wife and mother in law that are in an apartment. Because the apartment balcony is to small for a normal size grill my wife told me this grill is perfect for two people to cook meals on. There were alot of grills to choose from but because I had a big Charbroil grill at home when we lived in a house. I figured I couldn't go wrong. It turns out my way of thinking was right on the money. As for the bottles the gas comes in they can be found at K-Mart in the Camping Section. Don't pass this grill by because of its relatively cheaper price. You can always pay more money but because it costs more doesn't always make it better. Most times you pay more because of the name on the product and not the quality of the product.
3,"Well written, but utterly unlikley.","I enjoyed the style of this book. It is a well written mystery, with a reasonably likeable cast of characters. Great setting, interesting comments on social problems, and relationships.The things that made me not like this book more are the following. 1)The killer is obvious. 2)For me was the clincher. In this case, we are supposed to accept that a prisoner who signed up for a clinical trial of an influenza drug instead is taken in for a total face transplant. Umm, hello? Even if you assume that the doctor is stupid and unethical enough to do such a thing, there is NO WAY the data could be used. It would be a criminal offense, and at the very least, could lead to the doctor's being blacklisted and sued for malpractice. Because of this, I couldn't give the book a higher rating. Still, it is an interesting read."
3,Straker's not striking,"This CD, while pretty good, was a little more primative than I expected. I guess I was looking for more of a tourist Calypso sound and this is island roots."
2,its a trap...and not the one youre looking for,"yes, in this dvd you are briefly introduced to reference points and the pak sau, lop sau etc. but the applications are hardly realistic the options of applications are sparse and the most ridiculous thing of the dvd is half of it is the limp wristed guy in the blue on the cover just doing his philosophy on what the techniques mean to him...what a wretched waste of time...check out bob breen JKD Kali from Dieter Knuttels ABANICO website, Inayan KDM basics dvd or Barry Cudas Grappling DVD if youre interested on an application on this subject..."
5,Works great,I always forget I have this in the car. I never smell anything from nearby traffic. Maybe a little bit of diesel fumes but that is it. I will most definitely keep using these!
4,Filter,Most people don't know to replace the cabin filter on the Audi but it made a big difference in the way the car runs. It is also good for people sitting in the car since the air is filtered. Good price and I will be ordering more now that I know where to find them.Thanks.
5,Charcoal Cabin Filter,"The Mann-Filter was a perfect drop-in replacement for my Audi. The activated charcoal does a great job of removing odors from the air, although there is still some slight skunk odor that makes its way through, it is nothing like driving along and getting hit with a brick wall of skunk and you cant roll down the windows because you know its going to even worse... these filters do a great job of mitigating bad odors. These filters do need to be replaced about yearly so they dont get a musty smell in the car cabin."
2,There is a useful part,"Although it was probably not worth the price of admission his discussion on preventing bugs was useful. Essentially, if you have 1 week to do 2 weeks work you will produce buggy code.To avoid deadline stress like this he recommends a system for estimating work that consists of estimating what it would take if you could write it off the top of your head and giving it a factor from 0 to 5? for how unaquainted with the component techniques you are. Then raise your intitial estimate to this power to get your estimate for how long you will take for this task.However, I agree with all the other criticisms.2 stars. Not absolutely aweful but I could write better."
1,The Date You Were Born.,"It is kind of neat software. You enter the persons birthdate or Anniversary date, do a few other entries and you get out a nice sheet with all the data on the date your were born. The only problem is that this version only goes to 2003 and it is now 2006 so the prices for food, gas, bread, housing, stock market are not up-to-date. If you could get a free download for an update than it would be a great product and I would then rate it a 5."
2,no good,Nice textured case but it dident fit for my girl friends phone :( so with that being said I CANNOT RECOMMEND this case
3,Date You Were Born CD,"Did not receive it in a timely fashion, when I inquired about it, I was told the post office sent it back although the correct address was listed. The program didn't have everything I was looking for, I thought it would have the TV shows during that time period, Hot games out during that time. I saw a similiar one that had all of that and I thought I was getting the same thing. If given a choice I would order the other one and also advise others to do the same."
4,fun but dificult. PC game tiberium sun is 1000 times better.,"The main thing wrong with the game is that its the exact same as the pc version. It needs more red alert-tiberium sun stuff in it. You know, more techno and gadgits. People don't want a computer game on nentindo. People want better games on nentindo than the previous versions."
3,"Just ""More Of The Same"" kind of game","I loved the computer version of this, and when i heard it came for N64, i was delighted, but when i rented it, i was dissapointed. it had better sound, frame rate and graphics than for the pc, though. but if you have a good pc, there is no good reason to get the N64 version. Just to be safe, if u r a fan of c&c, give this a rental. Newcommers would be delighted, while veterans will be bored."
2,A Modern Perspective,"All right, looking at this from the point of view of a collector, you should probably skip this unless you're going for some kind of complete N64 collection. Yes, it's interesting to see an early attempt at stuffing an RTS onto a console, but it's not fun to play - nor is it very good-looking. There will be plenty of times when trying to select your units by dragging a highlighting rectangle over them with your analog stick causes you to lose a window of strategic opportunity.If you want to play this game, get the PC version."
4,"Great fun, but terribly addictive","Command & Conquer for N64 is a lot like the PC version, the big difference being the load time. I found the play to be challenging but arcade like -- its easy to just pick up and go. My only complaint might be the speed that the game can run at when a lot of things are going on at once (explosions, troop movements, etc.). Lotsa fun, lotsa good strategy."
5,A Great Game,"I was very impressed that they could turn such a good computer game into a Nintendo 64 game and still keep the fun and graphics. You need patience to play, but it is still fun. I love games like this and it was great. I can't wait for Starcraft 64."
3,"fun, but a disapointment","This game may look awesome at first, but if you buy these war games for skirmishes (like me) then you will be VERY disapointed, there is no skirmish/free game mode! Not to mention the lack of multiplayer and choice of color. If you like awesome in-depth stories, this is THE game for you..."
2,Don't buy this game under certian suggestions.,"Well, let me tell you. This game is the pits if you have already played the original Command &Conquer on the PC. Only difference is 4 new missions and the ability to launch nukes. If this is your first Westwood game, I would suggest you buy it. It has actually true 3-d enviroments. To me, this game was a dissapointment. Just the same old stuff. If I were you, I would buy something like Tiberian Sun or Command & Conquer Red Alert. Especialy Tiberian Sun has better graphics, new units, and uncharted missions. Anyway, I'm talking off the hook,just don't buy it if you catch my drift."
2,Stick to the PC,"I have been a HUGE fan of Command and Conquer games ever since they first debuted back in 1996. I was pretty excited to see the N64 release only to be gravely disapointed. All of the levels were the same as the PC version, there was no multiplayer (best feature of C&C games!), and the graphics were 3D but screwed up! Using the stick instead of a mouse to control your units is so hard it seems useless to try. Why spend $ on a jacked over version of a classic when you can buy the perfected computer version for cheaper? The answer is you don't!"
4,awesome war game!,This is an awesome game with good graphics.The play control is responsive and the challenge is great.
3,Okay Game,"Command & Conquer is a good game, but you get stuck a lot and it gets kind of boring after a while, it isn't a very rewarding game to play either. The graphics stink."
5,Best Night Light Ever,"I bought some of these based on other reviews. Then I installed them and bought more. I have had a bunch of different night lights, including some (really weak output) LED nightlights. This one does the job. It never fails to know night from day, it is bright and not blinding, and above all it allows me to safely move about the house and up/down the stairway without flipping on the overhead lights. I will keep buying more for myself and my family and friends."
4,LED NIght light,Does it's work....satisfied with the product.Will buy some more lights after I use them for couple months or so (just to test their durability/reliability).
4,Very Good light.,Lights were as described. 1 month and still going. Very low Sensitivity for the Sensor. So mostly on even during the day.I use two for one bedroom to have enough light. So not too bright. Easy on the eyes.
5,Excellent product and service,This item was exactly and described and arrived quicker than I thought. It's great for saving energy but offers the safety of a soft lit hallway.
3,remains bright,"I bought this product because I thought I could use 1 in the hallway at a brighter setting and one in the kids bedroom at the lower setting. I found there was little difference and both settings were bright (too bright for the bedroom).I also found that the light sensor needs fairly direct and bright lighting to make the device ""think"" it is day time and shut off. So the night light stays on more than it should.The frosted LED cover is decent.I would probably not buy again in the future. Maybe a 1 LED version is what I'll consider in the future for a similar application."
3,Intense,"I was using one of those Homer Simpson glowing green nightlights and it was bugging me so I ordered this one to replace it. It is white and I like that. But it is way too bright for my taste. It has a high/low switch, but the settings are almost indiscernible. High is fine, but low is almost as high. If you are night vision and spatially impaired, this is the night light for you. On the other hand, if you are neither and simply want a soft light to assist you, you should keep looking. Even on low this is like forgetting to turn off the light. I set mine on low and wrapped it in aluminum foil and it still radiates like the full moon on a snowy night. If they would redesign it to make the high setting be like the current high (or low) setting and the low setting to be a small fraction of the high setting, this would be the night light to buy."
2,One did not work after first night and the light sensor is not sensitive enough,"After plugging in one of the nightlights into a lit room, it instantly came on. I did not expect it to light up since the room I plugged it into was lit. It seems you have to have direct light shining on the nightlight for it to turn off - it would be nice to be able to adjust the sensitivity of the light sensor.The bigger issue is that after the first night of use one of lights stopped working. After unplugging and plugging the nightlight back in, it flickered on for a split second and stayed off (in a dark area).With that being said, the light they give off is bright but muted and would have worked well in our hallway had one not stopped working. I did not see much difference between the high and low light setting...it would be a little too bright for a bedroom even on low. Shipping back to Amazon (not being charged for shipping, and UPS picks up where they delivered it)."
5,A+++++++++++++++,"These are GREAT! They have a high and low setting, and my son and husband can see in the room at night lol. HIGHLY recommended and worth the price. A+ guys!"
1,neither light sensor worked,"Purchased a two pack of these night lights hoping they would be what I expected. Unfortunately, they were not. Neither one of the photo sensors worked and the lights both stayed on in a brightly lit room. I returned these promptly for a refund."
2,strobes / flickers / flashes,"It's hard to believe that no one else mentioned this in their reviews, but when the light level transitions to where the night light kicks in, there's a period where it flashes on and off, creating a strobe effect. It's otherwise a fairly good night light, but the strobing effect is pretty irritating when it does happen. We bought two packs, and all four lights do this."
1,never got the chance to try it!,"I was disappointed when my order arrived, and neither of the lights worked. I should have been more thorough with the reviews and seen that many other people had this problem as well. I'll be returning these and finding a new one."
3,Good low level light,Provides a good low level white light just right for a child's bedroom. Better suited as a night light than the clean lense product.
4,great,really good light to avoid the nighttime bumps and bruises...the auto off and on is a great convenience and energy saver.
5,Still working great!,We bought a 2 pack back in July 2009. We are still using them and they work great! They give enough lite to see and avoid tripping on stuff left on the floor.
3,Good bright light but doesn't turn off enough,"Good bright light, perfect for on the landing in case the kids get out of bed. Downside is they hardly ever seem to turn off in our hallway with a single window. Would prefer if they were more sensitive."
3,Works too well,"The sensor on the light was adequately sensitive to darkness levels and allowed the lights to come on at appropriate times. However, be forewarned that the lights are very bright. We bought these for the kids' rooms and they would be entirely too bright - this may have something to do with the fact that their rooms are probably on the small side. Others with more space to light may find the light level appropriate and less of a nuisance. Did not work for us, though."
1,3 out of 4 failed,"Love the lights especially the frosted lens but 3 out of the 4 I bought have failed and don't work anymore within 2months. Called company and I have to return the items to them for the replacement - ridiculous since it costs as much to send the lights to Maxxima than to just go buy a new one. In short, Great Product but poor quality control."
4,"Good Light, but cheap?","I bought this package of two, along with Maxima's MLN-09 and MLN-10. I like these the best, except that the switch on one of them is not working. It now will not turn on unless you are actively pressing the switch. I would return it, but I doubt it's worth the time and money.I like these best because the others don't have a light diffuser to provide a gentle light. The others expose the LED and are actually too bright at night when walking down the hallway. Since these are not so bright and intense, I put them in my girls bedroom.The sensor is not as sensitive as I would like. The area must be well lit from multiple windowns at mid-day before the sensor will turn the light off. Mine typically stay on for most of the day because of this. But heck, they consume MUCH less power in the long run than most other methods!"
3,"Works well, if its not DOA","I bought two packages of these (total of four night lights). Of the four, one was dead on arrival. The other three work great. Per other reviews I read, this seems to be common - that have a terrible DOA rate. After I had ordered these, I saw some similar items in the local Target. Per the experiences of others that have reviewed it, it seems that it will cost more effort to return the defective one that is worth. As such, you might just want to buy something similar locally without having to go to the hassle of returning the defective one that you have a good chance of receiving."
2,QUALITY CONTROL PROBLEMS,"I recently purchased the Maxxima 2 LED Night Light with White Lens (Pack of 2), and unfortunately I had the same quality control problem which several other customers have highlighted in their reviews of this product. The night lights are quite bright (which I wanted) and the soft white shades provide a nice quality of lighting. HOWEVER, the first time I plugged one in to the outlet, there was a flash and the smell of smoke - the night light shorted out and was dead. The second nightlight worked properly, but a 50% faulty rate is unacceptable. I also would agree with the other customers who commented that the ""High"" and ""Low"" illumination settings are not very different, the ""Low"" setting should be much dimmer than it is. Until the quality control issues are resolved, I would not recommend purchase of this item."
3,Human Resource Management textbook,The textbook is ok as far as college material is concerned. Not much difference between the 9th and 10th edition which was disappointing. Text book companies just trying to make a buck off college students.
4,As always my order came without flaws.,I have been attending an online college now for over 3 years and have always ordered from amazon.com. I have NEVER had a problem and this purchase was no different. Transaction was smooth and my order arrived earlier than had been anticipated. Book was used but could have easily been passed off as brand new. Happy customer.
5,Review,The book arrived on time and was in the shape I excepted. The price was reasonable and will continue to purchase text books through Amazon.
3,Human Resource Management,Still using the textbook. It appears that the book is too basic for graduate use...I recommend for undergraduate work.
3,Bought for school,"No need to review as such, I bought this textbook because it was required and Amazon had the right price."
5,"""Human Resource Management""","Human Resource Management by Milkovich and Boudreau offers the readers a chance to better understand what ""Human Resource Management"" is and how it effects the employees within an organization. Many of the issues such as (Unions, EEO, Labor Relations, diversity and wages)give a brigther picture of how important human resource management is to an organization as well as the employees. All topics were informative, and the is writing clear and to the point. Often, I found myself picking up my book searching throughout the pages to see what's next. I found this book to be good reading material, well worth the money I spent! I would highly recommend this book to everyone interested in reading a good booK ""Human Resource Management"" by Miikovich/Boudreau"
1,do not buy from these people,well i have to say after paying for and waiting over a month to receive my book. i have still yet to receive the item. so i am saying do not order from these people
3,ED SULLIVAN VOL 2 ROCK AND ROLL HITS,"Please see my comments on Volumn 1 because the same holds true here. A wonderful set of great old time rock and roll but at a ...price from the price gougers....Rhino Video. How can they justify [$$$] (suggest list) for only 60 minutes of entertainment. Look at Fox Video who have released classic TV shows in complete sets of 24 episodes for an entire season for just [$$$]. That is 9 hours of entertainment for about #10 to [$$$] over what Rhino is charging for one hour. I hope everyone who buys this edition or the complete set takes time to write to Rhino and complain about their price gouging. There is no excuse....they could have combined set 1 & 2 on a single disc and at [$$$] it would have been a fair price. Hey, if they have a liscense to release the Ed Sullivan Shows they have the ability to offer all kinds of sets....Rock & Roll, Comedy Classics, Holiday Classics, Great Performers, etc. There in no reason to get greedy with their first offering."
4,Exellent quick reference of C / C++ syntax,After I learned the basics of C++ only a very few of the syntax statements had I memorized. So for the hundreds of others not memorized the quick reference is a great way to look up the context and syntax for the satements. The book also has a short example of its usage for most syntax with a description of what it should do.
2,Too religious for my tastes,"I have nothing against religion, but I was very surprised to see that a large portion of this book is a fictional account of Joseph writing about fathering Jesus. Yes, there are probably good lessons to be learned here, but I couldn't get past the religious aspects of the writing to see them."
5,Intriguing and up-to-date,"Intriguing and - even three decades ahead - its reading still maintains the possibility of being a real description of what could be the first human being cloning successful procedure. Just out of curiosity, considering it is true, I do believe this could have happened in the Northern region of my country, according to many similarities..."
5,Hawkins: Gifted Teacher,"the bottom line on this two DVD set is that Ernie Hawkins is a gifted teacher.Well known for his talent, more important to the purchaser of this DVD (as well as his CAGED System and other DVDs) is his ability to communicate to his students.Similar to Homespun DVDs, these are also high quality DVDs and focus well upon the fingering with close ups. Like all gifted instructors, Hawkins anticipates where a student will stumble, and is patient in going over the material.If you love acoustic blues, you'll love this set."
5,the best,Ernie not only learned from this Master directly but teaches the Rev. in a manner that anyone can follow. You can not go wrong with Ernie Hawkins DVD lessons they are all excellent. Money well spent.
5,Pirkei Avot--Ethics of the Fathers,"Pirkei Avot-Ethics of the FathersIt is a collection of ethical sayings made by Rabbis who passed down Jewish law and tradition. Pirkei Avot was compiled around the year 200 C.E.This edition is visually beautiful and chock full of interesting commentary in well written English. I received it as a gift for my 50th birthday. It is easy to read, and a pleasure to browse through. I used this edition to teach selected sayings to a 12 year old girl from a non religious Jewish background. The commentaries sparked endless excited discussion. My student was enchanted by this edition and has requested that I buy it for her as her Bat Mitzvah gift."
4,Love the expansion but wish it had more scenarios...,Any fan of Zoo Tycoon 2 should love this expansion. This expansion pack includes:* 20 new rare animals with many endangered* Vehicle & Sky Tram Tours* Elevated paths* New challenges* New objects with some themedThe new animals are really near & the 2 kinds of tours are an excellent addition. My only complaint is that there aren't more challenges. There are only 3 categories with 3 scenarios in each. The 3 scenarios in 1 of the categories is just taking certain pictures. How easy is that? I want more challenges!!! The only other thing that I could nit-pick on would be that fact that the zookeepers still have trouble getting to some of the poop. Overall though I would recommend this game as long as you can get it at a good price.
4,fun! but not much actual game...?,"I got this for my 7 year old, but the whole family loves it. I like trying to make the ultimate zoo. My daughter is just trying to keep her animals alive, and my husband likes to ""experiment"" with putting a bunch of tigers together with penguins and other chaos. As far as I can tell it is more of an amusement and novelty than a game though. I dont mind."
5,Love Zoo Tycoon,When Zoo Tycoon came out I had to buy it and I loved it. Loved the scenarios and the animals. This is one of the best Zoo Tycoon games I've played. I don't own it yet but I'm going to buy it in a few months. Overall: Great.
5,The greatest expansion game to ZT2 ever!!,"I just got this game a few days ago and started to play it and man its really fun! I dont care for the sky tram but the Jeep ride is great!! Along with the 20 species i gotta say its nothing but fun-filled hours of playing and discovering great things!! I have all three expansion packs now i gotta get the safari one in which i m gonna wait out on finacially yet i ll get it soon enough but honestly this is a great expansion pack for all ZT2 fans; the dino, the marine and this one is the best yet!! Even the price is quite reasonable i highly recommned it for all fans of this great computer game!!"
4,I like it,"This is a nice looking thermometer, a good deal for the price, and it does what it's supposed to do."
1,Bad product,It is quite colorful but thats all i can say about it It is cheap. It is plastic. And it is 8 degrees off. Need I say more??? What a complete waste of money.
1,Do Not Order This!,"My Springfield Precision Instruments 13-Inch Thermometer with Heat Index, Wind Chill and Hygrometer arrived in the box face down with no bubble wrap and busted!! I asked for a replacement and still haven't seen it!! Obviously a company that doesn't care about the customers!!"
2,Thermometer,it seems to work but is really made cheaply! very thin plastic. made in china! i'm not impressed i guess were getting so used to buying this crap it takes something like this to remind us. amazon's shipping can't be beat it came the next day.
4,An attractive addition to our front porch.,"Easy to install, just right aesthetically..Displayed temperature is consistently 5 to 7 degrees higher than the actual. That may be a location issure."
5,perfect,Nice and big so can be read from a distance. Im not sure about the humidstat as it always seems to be low but I don't have any way to check it.
3,"Looks Good, Works OK","I mounted this on the wall of my shed under my RV port. Its in the shade and protected from the weather. The large display can read it clearly from the house. I was a bit disappointed that the temperature reads about 5 degrees higher than it actually is. It appears to be consistant however, its a shame there is no way to calibrate it. The humidity seems to be accurate. I would like to comment on the pervious review regarding the humidity - The humidity display starts at 40%, so it will look like it reading zero for anything humidity less than that."
2,disappointed,"looks good; measures temp o.k.; humidity indicator shows minus 0%; In FL not in OH, therefore, not a chance it's correct!"
1,Nothing more than expected (for the price),"Don't be looking for accuracy. And if the hygrometer is is important to you... keep looking. For what I paid? I didn't expect much, and I wasn't disappointed."
1,Buy a mercury Thermo for accuracy ...,"This thermometer registers temperature based on a metalic coil on the back of the unit. Mine read 4 to 7 degrees to low. The humidity indicator, as others have commented, simply doesn't work.Otherwise, it was an attractive ornament.I just threw it in the trash.If you want to know the temperature, I recommend the dual mercury thermometer for $10, including prime shipping, Reed MM2 Max-Min Analog Thermometer, -40 to 120 Degrees F.You can't see it across the yard, but it's accurate."
2,Looks as cheap as the price,"Looks like a toy and cheap. Well what do you expect for the price that you pay. It's a hollow plastic disc without a backing and with plastic clear covering, not glass. I'm not so familiar with its accuracy since I didn't bother to check it. If you want a toy looking thermometer then this is for you. If you want something elegant then find a more expensive product."
1,UNREALISTIC,"This book is unrealistic...if you have a military/law enforcement background it will disgust you. ""Special Agents"" running around with 2 pistols out shooting gangster style haha"
1,SPOILER ALERT: Poor Judgement,"I love fiction but am not fond of fantasy and characters who exercise unrealistically poor common sense. This was obvious when the main character did not notify the proper chain of command after he theorized correctly that a terrorist-lead, nuclear-missile armed ship is headed straight toward them. After the initial meeting with the sub's Captain (not the Commander) who sends an arrest team after a culprit, he never issues orders to protect his crew or sub. Another poor decision was made to surface the sub to send a message about a new murder not about the nuclear missile threat. This made the sub a sitting-duck waiting to be attacked. What sub Captain or Commander would make dumb decisions like this? Even after the torpedos hit, the NCIS team ask each other what is happening. The whole book was strange. I felt no real attachment to any of the characters. But I'm very glad our real life military functions better than this!"
3,OK,"Paid In Blood is a pretty good story that could have been a lot better.There are lots of events covered in the story. It has missing nuclear missiles, murder, black market action and more. These events are woven together in an entertaining way.The problems with the book are mostly in the areas of editing and lack of knowledge of the military. For example, the author referred to someone being a 'warrants officer' several times; it should have been 'warrant officer'.In another section, Mr. Odom introduced a character named Seaman 2nd Class Edward Dill. Just four pages later, he referred to the same person as 'Ensign Dill'. That kind of carelessness does not bring credibility to a book.I would encourage the author to study and learn a lot more about the military before attempting another book like this. He should also find an editor with a keen attention to detail."
1,TRITE,"I started to order all three books in the series and I am glad I decided to read the lead off book first. As a Navy and USMC Vet I can see errors in this book that amazed me. The US Navy has never given regular command of major combat vessel to a Commander. Command of aircraft carriers go to very senior four stripe Captains, usually the ships navagator is also a Full Captain and the Exec Officer of the USS Kennedy would have been a four stripe captain.As a former Police Officer I can also see errors of juristiction. The NCIS may have full juristiction on a Military Base but their authority does not extend beyond those limits. An off base Homicide investigation would still fall under the juristiction of the local authorites. Those authoraties might or might not agree to NCIS participatation but they would not relenquish the entire case. I also resent the implication that the Wilmington Homicide investigator was a fat moron."
1,Stopped reading,"I didn't get far because the religious references and the bible thumping were too much for me. This should be labeled as religious fiction. If it had been, I wouldn't have wasted my time."
3,a good read,"Enjoyed this book by Mel Odom. It was about international intrigue and has a large cast of characters. The cast is so large you might begin to lose track of all of them, but don't worry, the theme and the plot will get you back in.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,"Good Read ... Overlook the 'Religious"" Parts","Very well written mystery ... lots of twists and well developed characters. I could have done without the religious parts, but didn't think skipping over it took anything away from the story.Don't understand why it's tags as a children's book ... I don't think it's at all appropriate for children!As an aside ... reading on my Kindle means I always have my book with me. I'm reading so much more now that I have in years."
5,A Great Read,A good read. Kept me turning the pages well past bedtime to see what happened. Some good plot twisters and decent character development.
3,Fairly entertaining but hate the religious tone throughout,"Had I known the religious nature of this book I would have passed it up and will do so for any book by this author. It was fairly entertaining with lots of action. Not being aware of the innacuracies it didn't bother me, but the constant references to religion did. It should be listed in the religion category."
1,Not well read.,"I think it was a very good story, but it was not read well. How did the story end? I think I would have enjoyed the story more had I read it and not listened to it."
3,Man struggles with his faith,"This is the story of a man struggling to retain faith in the face of his divorce. In the backdrop there is the one described in the blurb, about a NCIS team trying to unravel the plot of a deadly mastermind and is quite engaging and a decent read. Unfortunately the two stories are not woven neatly, with Will's crisis of faith jarring the flow of the plot rather than adding to it as the scheme is uncovered. Had a couple more drafts been undertaken prior to the release of this book it could have left the reader with a feeling of elation as the two stories ran together rather than feeling flat having watched them jockey for position."
1,What happened to research?,"I've only read about a quarter of the book and I'm giving up on it. The author didn't do any real research apparently. The NCIS stuff is a joke. An aircraft carrier commander becoming a NCIS commander. Talk about a demotion. And then having civilian defendants represented by military lawyers and going to ""military court"". I was trying to live with these inaccuracies, but it just kept getting worse.Two of the characters are ""professional"" agents, but they carry two full sized handguns and use them like a gunfighter in the old west. Come on! Then the author has AK-47 assault rifles firing 5.56 mm cartridges. I gave up. I like my stories to have accurate details. This book does not."
2,Preachy,"It wasn't a great book by any means. Simple writing style where the author felt he needed to tell us that he knows a lot, instead of limiting his knowledge to pertinent plot points. Also, the religious aspect of it is contrived and heavy-handed."
4,Excellent and Exciting,I love Odom's NCIS Series along with Don Brown's Navy Justice Series. Great combination for my library!
1,Religious jibberish masquerading as a murder mystery,"The main description of this book says nothing about the content being riddled with messages of faith and religion. This is no murder mystery, it is a Jehova's Witness on your doorstep.Don't open the door, or the book.They need a rating for ZERO stars. I was forced to select one star, and this book is not deserving."
4,Enjoyable read,"I enjoyed reading this book. It was quite exciting. However, the religious content was a little irritating. A bit unreal how every thing worked out so neatly in the end. But still a good read."
1,Avoid!,Do not buy! This Blu-ray is missing the last 10 minutes of the film! This is despite Olive Films website claiming it is the full 104 minute version of the film
2,Dissapointing ending,I have waited a long time for this movie. If you are a fan I would wait some more. Do not buy the US edited version. I eagerly awaited the climax of the film only to find it ends abruptly after the song 8th Day. The last scene of Kate after her breakdown is completely missing. Feel very let down.
3,Breaking glass,"I liked this, but it had the American, not the British ending, which was better, so was quite disappointed that l had brought the wrong one."
5,Good Drum,It sounds just great. I'm very happy with it. Starting a drum class with it soon. It looks very nice too.
3,=(,"Not what I had first expected, really good book to be used as a reference guide, rather than a book on showing you more features of vb."
4,Close to five stars.,"If I wasn't so familiar with Dave Barry's work, I would probably have called this a five star book; it is a delightfully funny collection of columns by one of the best humorists in the world. But I've seen better from Dave, and have come to expect it, so I have to rate this book at four stars, simply to differentiate it from his best work (Dave Barry Turns 40, Dave Barry Is Not Making This Up, Dave Barry's Book Of Bad Songs, Dave Barry's Only Travel Guide You'll Ever Need, maybe Dave Barry's Greatest Hits)."
1,I agree with Everett -- the audio version is terrible,"I wish I had followed Everett Logan's advice and skipped this cassette. You can tell that the material itself is great, but the narrator is terrible, terrible, terrible. He dumbs down the text. I bought this to give to someone recuperating from surgery, but decided to listen to it myself first. I'm glad I did -- I would have been embarrassed to give this to anyone."
5,WARNING-This book may cost you your marriage,"Unless your marriage is solid DO NOT BUY this book. My wife and I have been fighting over possession of the book since its arrival at our home earlier this week. As we each individually read this book, we find ourselves constantly annoying the other by giggling or laughing out loud. Now, in our house, the serious news of the Presidential Election (otherwise known as ""Miami"" Blues) is constantly interrupted with phrases like ""You've got to read this"" or ""Listen to this"" or ""I can't believe he said this"" or we just read a small excerpt and laugh. I think my marriage may survive our joint reading of this book. Otherwise I'm sending my lawyer's bill to Dave in Miami."
3,"As a Catholic, I had to wonder what all the fuss was about...","I'm a cradle Catholic, and this story of a conversion to Catholicism by a Church of England student during the Oxford Movement was a bit mystifying. I am glad I read it though, as I found out much more about the Church of England!It is also an interesting look into the ""lifestyle"" of Churchmen in the UK during this period."
3,half n half,"I love the symbol, but the chain is terrible so i just switched it with another chain so its good now i recommend only if you have a back up chain waiting to replace the one it comes with."
5,Shinigami Neck less,The neck less was everything I wanted and in very good quality. To chain is strong and the metal holds a shine.
4,malts for my son,Just the right mallets at a good price. Could not find any locally so Amazon was the next best place to easily find them.
3,"works well, but not in all circumstances.","the tape works well.. highly reflective, but only at a narrow angle with a direct headlight. This is as described but will not provide the same level of wide angle visual safety as other more conventional tapes. This tape suits people who want the black look as a priority."
4,"So far, so good...","Quick shipping, no issues. I put it on the back of my helmet - it's easy to cut and flexible enough that it can be stretched a little to match the curves better. Shining a flashlight from about 20 feet away in a dark room makes it light up, I haven't tested it under car headlights yet. It disappears well enough in daylight, but you can still see it's there so don't expect it to vanish completely. It hasn't been on long enough to see how it'll hold up over time, but so far I like it."
5,Wow,Placed this on the sides of my truck bed & lower frame of my Harley & I cannot believe how well they reflect light.
5,Safety first... and second...,Great product. Used it to make a few things just a bit more safe as well as to cover faux chrome making it not only black but reflective as well.
3,Colour is not right!,"Red is looking like purple/maroon, and look almost the same as orange . Purple and blue look almost the same."
4,Good educational toy,"Product was exactly as advertised except the color of the red cubes was darker than on the cards. My 4 year old had trouble figuring out which cubes were supposed to be the red ones. Other than that, I would recommend this product to others"
3,record collecting,This book was ok but very general. It shouldn't be called the Music Lover's guide to record collecting. A More appropriate title would be The music Lover's guide to the history of records.
3,Guide to Record Collecting,"The book was good but I was looking for more of a price guide, however, my husband is enjoying it."
3,Tracking List,1 The Medicine Song2 Edge of the Razor3 In My Life4 Give It Half a Chance5 Outrageous6 You Just Might Need a Friend7 Everlasting Love8 Rough Trade9 Undercover
3,"Not her signature style, but worth checking out","Stephanie Mills went for a more pumped up synth-pop style with this album, which disappointed some people and is not a completely engaging listen all the way, but is worth checking out for the song ""Undercover"", in which her voice is still very high-quality, and the synth riffs in that song are pretty infectious too."
4,Its Worth The Price.,I Have This Cd It's Worth The Price I have To Say Track#3 In My Life Is The Best On The Album She Belts It Out And Track #4 Give It Half A Chance One Of Her Best Ballads.If You Are A True Stephanie Mills Fan Then You Will Be Pleased No Matter How Much It Costs.
5,This Book is a MUST to Experience!,"Richard Sobol takes you on a soulful journey to the Abayudaya Black Jewish Tribe in Uganda. His words and pictures capture the hidden beauties of the Abayudaya. Together with a CD of ""live"" music from the Abayudaya recorded by Jeff Summit, you do not ""read"" the book - you EXPERIENCE it. If you are Jewish, or not, your soul will be touched and your eyes will be opened. I already own one copy and plan on purchasing more as gifts. This is not just a coffee table book - it is a book that you will go back to time and time again, and will be proud to display."
4,"Beautiful, unusual cuture","NOT YOUR ORDINARY PHOTOS OF ARICA, A BEAUTIFULLY PHOTOGRAOHED BOOK OF AN UNLIKELY CULTURE IN UGANDA.."
1,Another rushed title to milk more out of the Linux bandwagon,"If you have more than 10 minutes Net experience and say, ooh, 3 minutes of coding html you can skip the first 200 or so pages. If you have a couple of days of Linux under your belt, you'll find that most of the remaining content can be found in the relevant man pages.If you're about to join the Linux club you should note that the author used the Caldera distro, and he assumes you will too. So don't install RH/SuSE/whatever and expect to find his admin menu! He also assumes you'll have enough knowledge to fill in the gaps where he was obviously getting bored writing the book.Sysadmin's should not look here.Also includes one of those completely out of date CDs. Why oh why?"
2,Watch out! Bad Examples! No Workie!,"The examples in the book regarding SSI do not indicate double quotes "" around the commands. If you're not familiar with this (like I wasn't) you'll probably end up banging your head against the wall for weeks trying to figure out why SSI doesn't work."
1,Really Suck!,"Suck! Yes it was really suck. If you want step by step instructions, you are better off buying other book. The CD-ROM was really really lousy because they have so little driver listing. I have installed RedHat Linux before, and it worked great with all software drivers available in their presented option (I tested this Caldera version because it offered 500MB disk space rather than 2Gbyte like RedHat.) I have all brandname hardware device and yet this Caldera does not have software driver for me to install. Ex: SoundBlaster from Creative Lab, now this is the basic standard sound card. How could this Caldera not support driver for this? see what I mean. So, If you got no name brand, you are in deep yogurt! I don't have money to throw away; so, I am really regretting buying this book. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
3,It sucks,I got a very hard time installing the game and many errors occur during the game. Dont expect to get the full game cuz the errors pop up many times during a game. It seems the installing CDs are corrupted.
3,Meteocrity at its best,"Microsoft games are good, but very little change. Also, the game is based on a fictional story instead of real past circumstances as it was in previous editions and as it is portrayed in the advertising campaign. Finally, the game is fairly short for as much as it cost, the AOE3 game had only as many levels on it as the War Chiefs expansion pack has, which is $15 cheaper. Both parts should be the same cost."
5,This game is awsome,I have played all of the Age of Empires series and this one is the best hands down.
2,where are the custom scenario games???,no one can make a custom scenario game on eso that means no castle blood no grave blood no soldier store where are the good custom scenario games i went to check out aoe2 at the zone and most of the population was playing custom scenario doesnt es relize this what are they thinking i would not even waste ur money on this thing i did buy it but now im going back to aoe2 to play the custom games.
1,It just wouldn't run,"My hw is overkill for the game. It seemed to install just fine. And then it just wouldn't run. Click on the icon and nothing happened. There was no help anywhere for it. I checked all the ""fixes"" online and nothing worked. I've worked for VAR's troubleshooting PC's for a living and I couldn't get it to run. I'd give it 0 stars if I could."
3,"Decent, but has issues","I thought the game was fun and the game play was simple and yet challenging. Also, I have anolder machine (2 years) and it played fine from a graphics and response perspective but sound was a different matter. I had terrible sound issues. I dowloaded the first patch and it fixed half of the sound problems and the second patch (released in late November) seemed to fix the remaining half. The problem I had was that by then I had already played most of the campaign. The issue I would have was that the music would play but the sounds of battle or people talking would be gone. It was rather annoying. As I said, it seems that the latest fixes have remedied the problem but I fear that the Microsoft game engineers have taken the same approach that their Windows guys do, put out a flawed product and put fixes out. Basically the beta testing is done by paying customers..."
1,Don't bother unless you prefer single player,"If you enjoy single player only, then it's a great game.However if you intended to play multiplayer, don't bother.The server has been down repeatedly. The game gives you ""xp"" , or experience points, which decides which level Home City you have.At this point in time, if you're one of the lucky ones, you will receive the xp you have earned, most of us however, haven't received our xp.Under the chat browser, there are chat rooms listed that promise ways to fix the xp problem, however the ES people then say there is no way to fix them, yet they leave the chat rooms so people remain confused.There are only a few hundred people average on the server, the most it's hit is probably 1,110, while early morning US hours, there are usually around 30-40 people...If ES can't handle so few people, what are they going to do when more people try to join?"
1,What a piece of crap!,"Do not buy this game. There are legions of ""throughly modern and up-to-date"" video cards that are simply ""not supported"" by AoE3. Once again Microsoft puts their profits before performance and the consumer is screwed. This might be a pretty good game. Someday I might play it. But for now the formulaic Microsoft rush to sales before first order bugs are removed means that you, kind citizen, like me, will very likely be screwed by this (non)game."
3,AoE 3 could have had better Expansions...,"This game overall was good, but it could have been better. One of the main setbacks for me was pausing the game. Instead of the words, ""Game Paused"" showing up on screen like in the original AoE3, this big brown box with ""Game Paused"" in tiny print was there instead. It is so big that it blocked my view of 2/3 of the game screen. The new civilizations were cool when I first used them, but they never pay off. The units were weak, the buildings had few upgrades, and the whole ""Firepit"" thing just wasted my villager's time. The original civilizations took over the new ones very quickly if a large force was sent in. Lastly, the concept of using stealth to sneak into enemy territory was awsome, but as soon as I got within enemy range I automatically uncloaked and got torn apart. The only good parts I saw were getting many new upgrades to the european civilizations."
4,"Great game, with a few tiny issues","I have played and enjoyed several real time strategy games, so I was interested to see what this one would be like. Without question, this is the best RTS game that I have ever seen or played, and is definitly near the top of the greatest games of all time. The graphics are ahead of their time (just make sure yours system can handle them). In addition, the gameplay is extremely good. The designers have put a lot of thought into the relative strengths and weaknesses of this game. In other words, the gameplay is balanced, with out overpowering strategies that are impossible to combat. The online multiplayer gave me some trouble at first, but I was able to resolve that issue fairly easily. In the world of strategy games, Age of Empires III has definitely made a place for itself next to Civilization and the other greats."
1,I want to give it zero but I couldn't,"-Graphic is not that great even compare to RON- ALMOST NO UNITS VARIATION! Units variation is very important for RTS game.-Only to imprerial age.- Information is not clear. For example, hit point of units and building.- Boring home city system. This is RTS game my friend, not another card/ board game.I list it on ebay after 1 hour I installed this game."
1,AI Won't Build Ships,"Seems people aren't mentioning that the AI (in vs computer opponent games) will not build docks, and even if you create a map with pre-built docks for AI players the AI barely uses them.On an island map there is no contact between civilizations until they reach flight technology."
5,Have fun with this game!,My family have been AOE fans since they first came out (that's right) we love history even though we live in the forest and have many distractions we still love AOE they are historically accurate and the're are manythings to do you'd be amazed so have fun and be a fan!
2,Disappointing,"A step down from Mythology.I bought this having seen the great trailers and game footage. The graphics seem to be good, but on my fairly new computer (1Gb Ram and 4 month old video card) I had to run them at about half their potential to keep the game from stuttering.The Gameplay sadly is unoriginal and features the uninteresting fight for North America.Stick with II and Mythology, until you can get this for about $10, because that's what it's worth."
3,Step down from AOE2,"I've finished the campaigns and I am now onto individual play.Pros:Better graphics than AOE I and II.Cons:Campaign play was way to easy.Seems like much of the code was devoted to the story and cut scenes.Infantry can take as much as 10 cannon shots to kill, very unrealistic. Discourages building fortifications they are useless.Changed game to be based more on the game Risk with ""cards"". Lags behind on building civilizations like AOE2.Not much variety between civilizations, everyone has for the most part the same weapons.Overall, this is a step down from AOE2 for game play. The graphics are improved, but it's not the reason most people play the game."
3,Fun but had issues...,"Pros: The RTS gameplay is good and, in general, the game was pretty fun to play here-and-there for a few weeks.Cons: The game would crash every time I tried to switch back into the Windows environment with it still running (I have 2GB of RAM). The graphics are also nothing special compared to some other games of this vintage."
3,Great game...for a time.,"Are of Empires 3 is a great game. You have the choice of a story mode, free play, there are battles on land and in water. Hire mercenaries, wage war on elephants or have wild beasts running at your side.The differences in the cultures you can play as really stand out. They make a huge difference so no two countries are played the same. This can help support a play style strength or help make up for a weakness.This game is hugely fun. It does however get old after you beat the story mode(s) and rip through your first 20 free play games (even at the hardest difficulty). I would expect to get anywhere from 80-100 hours of fun out of this one before you shelf it or give it to a friend."
5,the best Strategy game in the world today.,I think Microsoft has consistently maintained a high quality series.I think it is the best AI game on the market today.....I am very pleased.
4,Size of the Men of War,"I'm an old Age player who really appreciates the size of people in Ages 1 & 2. Because it makes the game more realistic for me. But when subsequent heavy 3-D grafics came out (like Age of Mythology), everybody got tiny. One can't tell what the unit is unless you zoom in but then you loose much of the battle field.Does Age of Empires 111 AND itd new expansion carry on the tradition of larger images for its population??"
4,AOE III,It is entertaining on many different levels. It is different everytime we play a different scene. The large number of maps lend multiple environments for your single player games. The one downside is that this game is a computer resource hog unless you have a gamer computer.
3,OK. OK,"AOE rocks. However, the theme of this version was not that appealing. Talking of big empires and nations, this one was about petty fights."
2,ho hum,"Very disappointed. I bought this game thinking ""finally a new RTS with the latest and greatest technologies"". Graphics are nice but the game play was sucky at best. The AI is non existent. the map sizes, even the large are really, really small. The support buildings are few, and pretty much unnecessary for strategy. There are only 3 resources food, coin, and wood. The newest concept ""home city"", basically a way to support and a method to customize your abilities as a culture or civilization, is very cool. It is the only reason I give it 2 stars, its a new concept. My opinion, go back to playing Empire Earth it is much more fun. I can't believe I fell for the hype."
4,Great thinking game,This game is a great thinking game. I use this game at my school and home during breaks and just for fun. I hope you enjoy it as much as i did.
4,Age of Empires III,"I'll admit my patience for computer games is not great, but my son absolutely loves this game. My settlements barely get off the ground before some enemy force is killing all my colonists. My son even has monster trucks driving over his opponent's buildings.I bought this game hoping it would be relaxing, but mostly it is just another frustrating computer game that I don't think I'll ever have the time to fully master. But still I'm glad I bought it. The ""violence"" is little more than computer graphics acting out what kids read in history books, so I think this is much less violent than video games and other ""M"" or ""T"" rated computer games. The graphics are good and the scenarios are realistic (no matter how unlikely they may be) so I think this is a good game.Who knows, maybe someday I'll get good at it. But computer solitaire is more my speed."
2,Bad graphics,"I still play AOE 1 because the graphics are so simple it doesnt hert your eyes to play it for hours. I didnt like the graphics in AOE 2, and after reading all these reviews I dont think i will buy AOE 3. I advise AOE team to make it simple, but fun. (for example dont use green but light brown in the background"
1,STINKY!!!,AOE III STINKS LIKE A DEAD PIG!! IT'S SO BORING AND DULL COMPARED TO AGE OF EMPIRES II THE CONQUERORS!!! GET THAT INSTEAD!!
1,THIS STINKS!!,AGE OF EMPIRES III SUCKS!!!! Theres just two armies standing in box formation shooting at each other and it looks so dull!! Get Age of Empires II The Conquerors!
1,product key,"the product key included in the game does not work. although we have tried multiple times, the game will not load."
2,AOE II IS A MUCH BETTER GAME THAN AOE III,"If you have AOE II and want some more fun get out of amazon and play AOE II.If you have not played AOE II go to pc games here on amazon and buy it and when it comes in you will have the best pc game I have ever played!!!AOE III you loose just about all control of armies you put them in one area and as soon as enemy unit comes buy they end up all over the place.I have read graphics are better on AOE III than AOE II okay if you say so,maybe I do not notice the upgrade in graphics because I have no control of armies.I think the people who made Aoe III must not know what s stands for in rts game ."
2,Age of Empires III,"We were never able to use the game, because it is not compatible with most computers. check your computer specification before buy it."
3,"This is a fun game, but the MULTIPLAYER SERVERS DON'T WORK!","It looks great.. I can only imagine how it looks on full detail. It plays well too. Innovative game design with the cards, but I hope you don't plan on playing with other people!ESO. The multiplayer server for this game is HORRIBLE. You can't create games. You can't join them, and by some leap of faith if you could. If someone disconnects, it freezes the game.Go to http://agecommunity.com/ forums if you need proof from other user experiences."
2,Too Much!,"What is the point of having a great game if it only runs on a few systems. I have a great less then a year old Toshiba laptop with a P-4 3.2 ghz, 512 ram, and a 64 meg video card that runs other big programs like Flight Sim 2004 great. But it won't run Ages 3. After 2-5 minutes every time my laptop just shuts off. It had never done that before and I keep it defragged and clean and it won't run Ages no matter how much I dummy down the graphics. My video card is not one of the ones listed as being a problem (but there are too many listed, a lot of people will run into that problem also.)I have been through several levels of on line and live tech support and have had the laptop sent in to be checked for a hardware problem, but I am very dissapointed. I have had every version and was really lookinig forward to getting into the Americas, but I guess I will go back to Rome or try Civ 4.From,really dissapointed in Ohio"
4,Great Game!,This game is AWSOME! We have had it for a little while and it is a fantastic game! I play alot of the skirmish matches (offline) but the campain is the only thing i didnt really like about the game. It was too short and too easy. But the rest of the game is awsome! Some people reviews were talking about how realistic the game was. Some said it wasnt. Who buys a video game because of how realistic it is? Its a video game people! Its not real life! Ya its cool to see someone get blown up and fly through the air but thats not why you buy video games is it? I buy them cause i enjoy playing them and because they are unrealistic. Where else can you control a couple hundred people and take over a entire area? this game is very fun to play and i have spent some time playing this game and it is a great game. it runs smooth and it does work with windows 7 but the computer has to downgrade to make the game compatable to play.
4,Misleading...,The picture for this product is misleading. I ordered this in hopes of getting the expansion with it. It says Gold Edition and I did NOT get the expansion with it. Just the base game. I wasn't too happy about that... At all.The game is fun however. Hours of fun to be had.
4,Best one in the series,"This game is a lot more fun than the 1st 2. I like the graphics a lot better, they have realism with the building crumbling instead of just dissapearing. I enjoyed the campaign thoroughly. This is a real-time-strategy-favorite-of-mine. I would suggest it.ScoreGraphics 8.7Gameplay 8.7Story 8.8Overall 8.7"
5,The Review for Age of Empires 3,this game is really fun it has been a experience we dont play this much but we play the expansion for this which is way fun it is the Asian or have ever u spell it but we love the game and we recommend getting this and the expansion with it
2,Didn't work,The game I bought for my brother was not compatible with his Windows. Make sure what you get is ready for the machine.
2,Disappointed,"Why game companies push away from the 2d video game for the 3d feel game is beyond me. Most RTS games are shown from high up where you can zoom way down and control small battles or zoom out and control an army. AoE III took away the zoom out.. You are so in the face of everything you can't really see what you are doing. Maybe the 3d assets/textures would be too taxing on the system, but then thats a design flaw.. Anyways, decent game, but I got extremely frustrated with the camera."
5,Chess like Strategy with great gameplay,"This game is great to show the economics, military strategy, resources and etc of civilization, plus its a LOT of fun. My son and I like to play chess, and this is very similar with lots of interaction and online LAN excitement .............. its really addictive, ...you can win !! its great"
4,Very nice.,I am not a gamer in general but Age of Empires is an exception to the rule! I have played all previous versions. This addition is way better in graphic. However it needs a very advanced computer to be able to play without problems. You will need a good video card. Following scenario in AOE III I noticed virtual play area is relatively smaller than previous versions. I think if you liked other versions of AOE you will enjoy this one as well.
4,If You Like To Fight...,"AOE3 is a basically fighting. The economy is simpler than Age Of Mythology. But the battles are exciting. The cannons are able to knock enemies flying, break holes in buildings, and knock down trees. Some units, such as pikemen and crossbowmen, look a bit out of place. New for AOE3 are experince points: points you get from killing enemies, finding treasure, and setting up trade. But my favorite new feature is the Home City, a place that gives you forts, factories,etc. The economy has been dumbed down, but the battles ALMOST make up for it."
5,"people, listen.","Age of Empires III is a good game. Don't hate it because you have a bad PC. Don't make a review like ""Oh, it won't work, therefore it deserves 1 star!"" If your computer can't handle it, go review your computer.Age of Empires III takes place around the Revolutionary War. It has 8 civilizations trying to conquer the New World. There are many new concepts in this game, such as Home Cities and Native Americans. There are mercenaries here which are like normal units on steroids.People here are saying the combat is too simplified. Not true. You need to memorize all sorts of units, not just cavalry owns artillary, etc;. You need to find out what kind it is so then you can own the opponant.Its a good game. Very strategic."
2,Great graphics - lame game play,"Microsoft should have just spent the time making a nice graphics upgrade to AOE2. AOE3 graphics are great but the game play is not. First off, the top civilization is Imperial - yuck. Secondly, the introduction of the 'card' system for building a home city is really boring. In addition, the unit selection is HORRIBLE, the combat units are WAY over powered when it comes to attacking walls. What's the point of a wall when a handfull of Indians chunking spears can take out a section of the wall in a couple of minutes. Also, where on EARTH is the formation selection? There are a LOT of simple 'actions' missing from AOE3 that are (in my opinion) fundamentals and are present in all the other games (AOE2, EE, RON, etc.) This game kept my interested for about 2 hours.Overall this game is just more of the same - not worth the $50. Save your $50 and keep playing Empire Earth or Rise of Nations."
1,"Won't run on Windows 7, 64 bit (despite claims to the contrary)","Don't buy this if you use Windows 7. The packaging says operating system ""Windows XP or higher"". This is a lie. It doesn't work on Windows 7. Don't trust this company. They also will not refund your money despite their misleading claims. I'm very disappointed."
1,This game isn't all cracked up to be.,This game is not really that good compared to the previous game.The game play isn't that great and the fighting is kinda lame.I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone.
2,"AOE letdown,Anyone who has played AOE 1 or2 wont like this","I play AoE2 all the time and i bought it when it first came out 6 years ago! AOE 3 suxs,this will never live to up the the first game nor should it be named Age of Empires,this a bad! BUY AOE 2 GOLD!! NOT THIS POSER GAME!"
1,Terrible Service,THESE PRODUCTS ARE ALL LIES! I ORDERED THE GAME FOR MAC! IT CAME FOR PC TWICE! I HATE HOW AMAZON LIES! AMAZON CANNOT PROVIDE GOOD SERVICE. ITS A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!
3,pretty fun... but....,"The graphics can get really sweet. but I've not seen a system yet that handles them well without getting laggy. The game play is pretty fun. I really like the hot-key functionality for buildings (something I wish other RTS games had). In the end, I realized that I like StarCraft and Warcraft III better, and don't play AOE 3 much anymore."
2,You will need a supercomputer,"I have wasted a good part of my life playing AOE I and II, and AOM. My PC is a 2GHz AMD/512MB RAM/ATI 9800 Pro video card. I know my computer isn't the fastest out there, but it's a decent performer - AOM runs perfectly on it. BF2 runs great. AOE III will not run on my computer. It takes 10 minutes just to get into the game, and the game play is broken - runs a couple seconds, pauses, runs, pauses, etc. I'm giving this a bad review because the recommended system is less than what I have. It's back to AOM until I can buy a screamer."
1,Slow as mlasses,"The game runs slow as molasses. I have twice the processor power than recommended, a 256mb Video card and 750mgs of ram.Can not get the sound to work. System tells me to turn off all the good graphics the game has to offer! Save your money!"
2,"Great, if your PC can handle it.","I got this game for christmas and i was very excited about the RTS gameplay. Just to inform, i have an AMD Athlon XP 1600+ with 512 mb Ram and an Nvidia Geforce 6200. After installin the game i had it running an almost full settings. When i made a mistake with the sound and accidently pressed ""Reset to Default"" even the graphics were reset. I tried to change them back to the high settings but nothing happened, i was stuck with the ""Squares"" of smoke and all that. I even bought a new motherboard! Overall, great game but be careful."
2,One of the Worst RTS games yet,"If you like the RTS genre, stay away from this game. Sure the graphics are great, but lets face it, the gameplay stinks. The campains are all ""historical fiction"" that are based around fictional characters. While the campains are ok, I wanted more actual historical campains. Development of your colony is boring, and the battles are small scale. Over all, just not that good. Home cities are nice, but not good enough to get you to like this game. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"
2,Waste of Money,It sucks. Its been changed around to much most of us dont even have a computer that can run it. I made the mistake of buying it from walmart. Dont get it
2,Age of Boredom,I really liked the first two and hoped that this one would blow them away. It didn't. It really disappointed me and I stopped playing it 1/4 of the way through.
1,Age of Empires III,I can not get it to work on my windows XP or Windows 7 machines. It arrived quickly and in good shape.
1,Didn't Work!!!!,"I bought AOE III from my local Future Shop with so much anticipation. When I brought it home, my Compaq couldn't load it. I finally figured out that there was an error on the CD. I exchanged it for another copy and guess what? Another error. I've since played it on other computers and although I like the interface, it always runs very slowly. Overall, it's not worth the trouble. I'd rather waste my time playing something else (*Kingdom Hearts for PS2*)"
2,WARNING!,"MAKE SURE you have a monster video card (64MB) that can handle hardware transformation and lighting before you buy this game! Most people's computers aren't able to run this game properly because they don't have the required video card. Game then pauses up and drains your CPU quickly, especially during battles. Useless unless you're PC is an ultimate gaming machine."
3,It's.... ok.,"The only things that this version of AOE has over the rest are the good graphics and the fact that there aren't a million ""races"" that are basically all the same. The ability to work with the Native Americans and the concept of a home city are interesting ideas, but they aren't that useful and they don't add much to gameplay. This is pretty much eye candy AOE and that's where it stops. It's still on OK game to play, but I wouldn't shell out the bucks for it. It came bundled with some hardware that I bought thankfully, so I didn't really waste much money on it."
2,Mediocre at best,"I've bought a lot of the Age of Empires products and have, for the most part, had a lot of fun with them. This version introduces a few new ideas (card decks, home cities, etc) that allow for some good replayability. It would be a good game, except...* Choppy audio (ALL of the single-player stuff suffers from this)* Weird bugs (occasionally you can create armies of instantly - a nice cheat if it isn't used against you)* Water based fights are horrible (I spent time deliberately playing some of the water maps because of the advances made in that area, but they can lag up any machine).* Nearly constant server outages"
1,"For some....great technical problems (i.e., BUGS!@#!)","WARNING: Bug-ware alertAfter paying my $50 for this game, I loaded the three CDs required, rebooted my computer, expecting to play all night long.Much to my surprise, I'd launch the icon to start the game, and it would give me an error and exit as it got to the main menu - each and every time. I made 12 attempts, still nothing. My computer is a 2005-model HP Pavillion with fast Pentium 4 and 1 GB RAM. Definitely should be able to handle this game.Being resourceful, I found the technical support site. I wasn't too shocked to find a significant number of people who also had this problem too. And the publisher does NOT have any answers for them -- certainly not when or if it will be fixed. (They already have your money, and aren't giving it back.) I'm still awaiting my answer too! And I'm still out my $50, plus tax and shipping.WARNING: Buy at your own peril. You won't get a refund. These people need to be held accountable."
3,Needs quite a few patches,"It keeps with the tradition of AOE but quite buggy. Walls don't work (Gates let enemy in, enemy can find wholes in walls). You sometimes have to tell your settlers more than once to do something. Boats won't unload via the Unload-all icon, you have to manualy unload 50+ units.I'm sure once these bugs get fixed it will be an awesome game."
1,Just a big let down,"I've loved AOE since the first installment and had been looking forward to AOE 3 for years. Unfortunately it turns out to be a huge dissapointment. Everyone else has mentioned the bugs and ridiculous system requirements to get the game working properly but these aside, the gameplay is just truly awful. I AOE 2, you could build a large, realistic looking and balanced army, in AOE 3 its just a rabble of very similar units that are impossible to organise. The maps are too small, the explorer unit is just plain pointless, resource gathering is not what it used to be and the trading posts are annoying to say the least. The main strength of AOE 2 was that it was open to multiple different types of play, from rushers, to stay at home economy builders, but in AOE 3 you have one set way to play and if you don't do it you lose.Overall, although not quite as much of a let down as Championship Manager 5, I'd strongly advise you steer well clear of this."
4,Graphics are Good...and Evil,"I played both AOE II and the Expansion extensively and thoroughly enjoyed both. This is truly enjoyable addition to the genre and will keep you playing for a while as you practice to get better and trying new skill levels. When I first started I could only win on ""Sandbox"" and slowly worked my way up. I can now win handily on ""Expert"", so you will develop a sense of appreciation in this game when you can win on every level.The graphics are beautiful, but on max detail things can get a little choppy in big battles - especially sea battles. I have a new Intel Dual Core 3.0 Ghz machine with 2GB RAM and the latest 7800GTX nVidia card, and it runs pretty well for the most part. No other game I have looks better on the 24"" widescreen. Did I mention I am still paying off my computer?I have played a couple of LAN games with one other person and it gets VERY choppy.Great game overall but it requires a ton of processing power and memory to enjoy the graphics to the fullest."
4,I like this game,I am in my forties and I like this game. A good game to play to get your mind off the daily grind.
3,BY A BOY - 10 YEARS OLD,"Three Against the Tide was an adventure about the Civil War. The characters were Susanna, Neddie and Sammy. The main character was Susanna who was 12 years old. She was the oldest of 3 children. She had to write in her journal every day as her father told her too, while her brothers sat down at the lake fishing. The story was about when their father went to war as a spy and did not come back for a couple months. So these three children had to take care of themselves while he was gone. First, they had to run Oakwood, the Plantation they lived on. Secondly, they went to live in Charleston, SC. While having no news at all of their father, they did not know if he was alive or dead. The biggest adventure in the book happened when they moved from Oakwood to Charleston in a boat.The book was not my favorite book in the world because I've read other books that have had more adventures in them. This one had a couple adventures but not as many as I would have liked."
1,disappointing,"I bought this grill last year with the hopes that it would become a regular part of my weekly cooking. I was sorely disappointed. This grill could never maintain a decent grilling temperature. I ended up buying another gas grill with a standard sized propane tank with a side burner to boot - worth it for the extra amount of money it cost, because it was utterly more useful. I don't think this grill is useful for anything except keeping food warm."
1,defective parts,This grill came with a broken thermometer and several bent and dented parts. Charbroil will not replace the parts unless the customer pays the shipping. Charbroil will not accept the receipt I received from amazon.com. Do not buy this grill and do not order it from amazon.com. Customer service is very poor and it will end up costing you more money to get this working.
1,Received with many missing parts,"I've only given the grill 1 star because of my frustration with receiving an incomplete product. I'll re-review once I receive the missing parts and actually grill on the thing. Somebody was asleep at the switch during packing because I'm missing both bags of hardware (screws, nuts, etc...), the grill top handle, the grill leg handle, all parts for the ignitor, the burner, and the grease cup and clip. I called the manufacturer's 800 number to get the missing pieces and they told me I should receive them in two days. We'll see... I'm a little worried at what I'll receive because the part numbers listed in my installation manual did not match the part numbers shown on the operators screen. It's probably just a substitution issue but I don't have a warm and fuzzy feeling. More to come..."
2,Its not a Webber . . .,"Alright, I admit that I'm a BBQ snob, if there is such a thing. This grill just doesnt quite measure up in terms of build quality or performance. The box arrived from amazon and the interior was filthy. The brickette bag opened up and the ashes were everywhere. It wasnt difficult to assemble, but its not the most solid structure ever. The fit of the top/cover is awkward. The flame inside the grill comes from a single contact point, which is located beneath a heating plate. Usually, this disperses heat adequately, but not when its windy. Also, as the grill ages, Im sure the flame will be less and less evenly dispersed, making for hot spots in the grill. Ill keep this grill for two years and then go back to a Webber."
3,Poor Quality Control,"Great idea because of the convenience, mobility, and size. It also seems to be constructed well. However, I have still not been able to put it together. It came with 5 essential parts missing. The assembly instructions are accurate, but are difficult to follow; and you don't know what parts are missing because everything is sequential. So you end up calling multiple times to get parts- and the service is horrible. So, hopefully, when I receive the 3 packages of parts I can finally use it!"
4,Patio size BBQ pretty much what I wanted for my apt balcony,"Size is great for small space, usually need to push ignitor button several times to light, somewhat annoying. But otherwise works well. Assembly fairly involved, need to make sure handle is on leg opposite the wheels. Might be nice to have way to hang BBQ tools or at least the wire brush. Overall satisfied."
2,"nice size grill, but paint issues","I was excited to find a grill that was not huge and you could easily wheel around. When I lit it for the first time to make sure it worked and after about ten minutes of heating up, it started making a popping noise. I noticed that the paint was starting to chip off in places. This occurred both outside and inside the grill in several spots. I am not sure if it was just this unit that had the defective paint or not, but I decided to return it and not try another model like this."
2,Difficult to Assemble - Poor Instructions,"While this unit is compact and serves its purpose, the Start switch (for igniting the burner) has never worked properly, so the burner has to be lit manually with a match. As for the assembly, dozens of parts were included and the instructions were poorly presented and hard to follow. Unless you're highly skilled at this sort of thing, you'll likely find assembly of this unit frustrating and time-consuming."
2,Don't buy if you need high heat for grilling,"First, do not pay attention to the older reviews that say it comes with a propane tank and ceramic briquettes. It does not.That said, this is a decent product that works as described. Its construction is comensurate with the price - A plastic base, thin sheet metal for the legs, a plastic handle - but the fire bowl is thick steel, the grid as others have said is high quality. The lighter works flawlessly.My problem with it is that it won't get hot enough for true grilling. Hot dogs took 20 minutes to cook on this, chicken almost an hour, and I can't imagine doing hamburgers on it.It's OK if you want to do slow cooking with the cover on, but my style is to build big fire and sear the meat so fast the juices don't have a chance to escape. For slow cooking I have an oven. This one went back to the big box."
3,Patio Caddie is okay.,"I bought this Patio Caddie about 5 years ago and it is still going strong. I loved having it on my small condo patio and now that I have a big back yard, I still use it. The only that I have experienced is that from new, on cold days, the grill takes a very long time to reach 300 degrees. The other day it was about 30 degrees F outside and the grill took about 35 minutes to reach not even 300 degrees. I don't know if this is a problem with the regulator or what."
5,Greatest portable grill made!,I purchased my second Char-Broil Patio Caddie Gas Grill recently. I wore the first one out after many years of use. The grill is perfect for quick grilling as we grill out all year long. Grilling chicken breast's is a one of our mainstay meals and takes just a few minutes to prepare the chicken on the grill. This is hands down the best small grill we have ever owned. I recommend this grill to people on the go and apartment dwelling folks.
1,"Terrible, patio 'warmer'","I bought one of these as it is compact and yet not a table top unit. There is one primary flaw with the unit which is that it simply doesn't get hot. If you want to sear something, you need to get a propane torch or something because the grill of the unit can't be lowered closer to the flame. This means that the food is always at least 10+ inches away from the heat. Because the heat is so weak, as soon as you remove the lid to check on the food, the temperature of the unit drops severely and doesn't recover for several minutes.Terrible, terrible, terrible grill.Really, it's terrible.Looks nice though."
5,CHAR-BROIL PATIO GAS GRILL,GREAT PRODUCT. DONT HESITATE IF YOU HAVE A SMALL PATIO. THIS IS THE ONE.STURDY AND WELL BUILT.
1,Not too HOT,"Extremely disappointed with this grill. It just does not put out the heat required to properly grill. If you want to char the fat.... forget it, even with the gas turned up as high as it will go. You better have a place to put the lid or be willing to work with one hand when you remove the top."
1,Piece of Junk,"My grill came unopened with missing parts and NO INSTRUCTIONS. When I called CharBroil customer support they had no help for me other than to MAIL me the manual (which obviously doesn't help me grill dinner tonight). I went on their website and while they offer a list of ~100 manuals ""in case you lost yours"", the one for this grill is not available. I'm beginning to wonder if they actually have a manual. The customer service person I talked to was ZERO help other than telling me to return the thing. I WOULD NEVER BUY A CHARBROIL."
3,Don t Expect Char-Broil Warranty Support for Amazon Purchases!,"This grill itself is ok but I had an unbelievable experience dealing with Char-Broil.The grill arrived with two broken parts that were packaged that way (there was no shipping damage). I called Char-Broil expecting them to replace the parts under warranty. They said they'd ship the replacement parts as soon as I sent a copy of my purchase receipt, which I did.Incredibly, a few days later I received an email stating my purchase price WAS TOO LOW for the grill to have been new so they would not honor the warranty!! They wanted me to buy the new parts for almost as much as I paid for the grill! I escalated it to a supervisor but got the same ridiculous answer.Then I called Amazon, received a return label ten minutes later, and a new grill four days later. Care to guess who understands customer service and who doesn't have a clue?PS - Take your time assembling the grill; the instructions are mediocre and the procedure isn't intuitive."
1,BIG waste to time and effort,"I ordered this item based on favorable reviews from friends. The grill was not available in stores in the SF Bay Area so I ordered from Amazon. It was not immediately available so I waited 4-6 weeks and it arrived on the promised date. However, the connection on the igniter cable was the wrong size. I called Charbroil customer service and was told they could not provide a new one because this grill is discontinued and no longer supported by them. (Huh? I said). Since I had the whole thing assembled anyway, I attempted a test using manual lighting and it didn't work at all. Based on my experience, my advice to anyone is: Don't bother with this item!!"
1,This thing...,I have tried to use it for the past year and a half and it never gets hot enough to cook more than a hot dog... We have decided to throw some charcoal in it the next attempt to grill or set it out to the curb from some other poor sucker.
2,Doesn't Burn but Barely cooks,This little grill looks nice but mine will not reach temps above 300 degrees. That was on a cool day about 60 degrees out side. It took a very long time to cook burgers but it did actually get them done eventually.I'm not sure I could cook chicken on this with such low temps. I have one other Char-Broil grill that lasted about one season. I won't waste any money on another. The only reason I bought this one is that I got it for 48 bucks.Its not really even worth that in my book.
5,Patio Caddie Gas Grill,This is a great little grill. It is a replacement for an identical grill that I have on my houseboat. The old grill was eight years old. It served me so well and fit my application so well that I bought an identical replacement.
4,Nice grill,"This grill does a great job of cooking dinner for small groups. The main problem we had with it was that the ""wheel base assembly"" did not include said wheels, but we're hoping the manufacturer will send them out for free like it says on the instructions. It's relatively stationary and light weight though so the lack of wheels is more annoying to me than a real problem. As for cooking, it does a nice job, everything cooks as expected, clean up isn't any harder than it is on larger grills. I'd say get the grill, but triple check to make sure every single bit is there before building it; the wheels aren't in the assembly pack like I assumed, they're already supposed to be in the base."
2,Good grilling but poor design,"The grill does a fine job of cooking. Design leaves a lot to be desired. The top of the grill is not hinged and designed to fit on the side of the bottom section, putting a 500 degree top next to your cooking movements - really bad idea!!! Where do I place this hot top, out of the way, when turning meat so not to get dirt or other stuff on it? Also with the wheels located, NOT opposite the handle, it is difficult to move with a tank attached (which will be most of the time). Definitely would not purchase again. Ignitor failed after the first use."
3,"Great grill, doesn't last a year","I've had two of these and the last one is in the garage on its way to the local dump. Make sure to get a grill cover or store it for the winter because the porcelain burner plate and other internals will rust out eventually. Otherwise, the grill is a great size for a small deck or patio and works well when grilling smaller things like fish, steaks, or veggies."
4,Crank it up,"This is a minimal BBQ, which is why I bought it. It works fine for 2-4 steaks, 4 brats, chicken for 2 people, etc. I much prefer charcoal for grilling, but it's not worth the time or cost to fire up a standard Weber for 2 steaks. It has a small foot print and a deck rail is sufficient to hold a plate and tongs."
2,"Great at start, deteriorated quickly","Bought one at end of season--for under 99 dollars. As I grill year-round, yes even in Chicago (in a coat in winter)--it got a workout. And died accordingly after only 2 years. Will NOT replace with same. If you use it only occasionally-maybe it would last."
1,David Fulmer,This is no more than a glorified propane cook stove. It has no lava rock or ceramic stones . Just a burner. Mine also came without a propane tank. Doesn't work too good without one of those. Could have bought one just like it locally with ceramic stones an a propane tank for 5.00 more. What a gyp.
4,The Little Green Caddie BBQ,"Char-Broil Patio Caddie Gas GrillThis little grill is a perfect size for a small patio. It took me 4 hours to put it together and only had one problem, which seems to very popular. The Wire for the ignitor doesn't fit into one end. After being sent a whole new grill (just for the part), it still didn't fit. I called Char-Broil directly and they informed me that they've had alot of calls regarding the ignitor wire for this model. They sent me one and it fits beautifully.The grill really cooks well and I am really enjoying it."
3,Condo Owner,It's a great BBQ for a small area.But one problem is I could not get it to light with the ignitor push button.I am still waiting on parts to see if this can be accomplished.
4,Perfect little grill..DOES NOT INCLUDE GAS TANK,"Heats up quickly, easy to assemble,sturdy, great size BUT contrary to the online description, it did not include the gas tank which had to be purchased for an additional $30. So it was more expensive online then at my local hardware store which included the propane tank."
5,Great Grill,"Being single and loving to cook, indoors and out, this grill was the perfect size for me. I bought it in 1998, used and abused it and left it out in the elements naked. It is still around today with the original guts and the igniter still works. I have dragged it everywhere in the back of my pickup truck. I will be purchasing a new one this year as it is really showing signs of wear. I will buy the same exact one. Bigger is not always better!"
3,You can hit me once but not twice,This item has been shown with a tank with the grill.But when you get it//it has no tank.All I can say is hope the Grill is as good as they say
3,"Great idea, but needs better execution!","As another townhouse owner, I was thrilled to find a smaller gas grill that would be large enough for cooking for two, but not take up all my patio space. This grill is a marvelous idea!That small tank is also very nice. As someone with a bad back, the smaller size is much more manageable. Just make sure you have a place that doesn't have a flat fill charge.I've had my Patio caddie for about three and a half years now. I still think it's a great design. The knob and ignition are just about to need replacement, but I use the grill year round.It's the year round part that brings this grill down to 3 stars. It just doesn't stay hot when it's cold and whatever you do, don't take the cover off for anything more than a second.So in conclusion, I really enjoy the grill itself, but if you are in a cold climate and grill year round.....you may want something with a little more horsepower!"
5,Great grill,"Bought this for my husbands birthday and he loves it. The non-stick type grill is very easy to clean, stuff still sticks to it a bit, but there's no need to use a metal brush - just pop it in the sink and give it a good wipe down. Perfect size for small garden or patio or just for couples who dont need a large grill - though we have successfully managed to feed a bunch of people with this grill.Love it!!"
5,Absolutely fabulous,"Outside of some difficulty with the manual's directions, this is very easy to assemble. I love the temperature gage, the easy-to-clean grill which can easily handle four good-size steaks, the dimensions which permits it to fit on a small patio and the clips on the unit's top so it doesn't slide around. My only complaint is that it is somewhat difficult to move because of the placement of the handle and the wheels."
4,It works for us!,"My fiance and I were looking in vain for a gas grill that could fit on our back deck.. shared with two neighbors in the middle of the city. Needless to say, there's not a lot of room. All of the grills we found were monstrous! Some friends suggested looking on the web-- and that's what brought us to Amazon and the Patio Caddie! We are quite happy with it: it suits our needs perfectly. It heats up quickly and cooks up the steaks and the turkey burgers just great. We, too, got the larger sized gas canister-- that's working well. We've been warned not to get the intended cover, so we're trying to figure out what we should get to cover it up -- at least during the harsh Chicago winter. In the meantime, we're happy grillers and our neighbors are thrilled too! (The other downside would be the lid issue-- where to put it..? The clips are awkward to use.)"
5,Long Time Owner,"Having owned this grill now for at least 4 years, I think it is the best grill I've ever owned (I've owned at least 20-30). We cook out at least 3 times a week. Rebuild grill with about $50 worth of parts just over a year ago. Must of cooked on this grill about 600-800 times. Best flavor, least flare-up, easiest to clean, usually just scape grill with puddy knife, and uses the least amount of fuel. Fuel usage is unbelievable, about 150 usages to 20 lb tank. I am going to purchase a second one just in case they quit making them. By the way try cooking beef roast on this grill using lots of worchestershire and seasoning salt."
2,You get what you pay for.,"If you are looking for a very low end gas grill this might be the one. Its shipped in a little box and has lots of parts, and takes a couple of hours to assemble. Parts are cheep and don't always line up or fit together very well. Once the grill is in one piece it take up very little space, so its good for a small space. I was disappointed with the flame adjustment, it's basically on or off. It's very hard to position the meat anywhere on the grill that is not directly over the flame, so the meat burns on the outside before it is done on the inside. The lid does not open on a hinge like most grills, you must completely remove the lid and put it somewhere to get at the meat. I wish they made a really high end gas grill for a small space. Not everyone with an outside balcony wants to slum it with their gas grill."
2,Disappointed,"I had previous Patio Caddie and was delighted. Decided to return to Char-Broil and ordered new unit.Several problems: mechanical lighter does not work, fuel valve does not shut off, and an area of the kettle has bubble through the enamel and is rusting.Would not buy again!"
1,Unresponsive Warranty Service,"When I received this grill from Amazon, the boxes contained only the shell of the grill -- ALL hardware pieces were missing. Char-Broil refused to replace the entire unit and required me to send them a list of missing parts (dozens). They never got all the parts to me -- even the gas regulator is still missing. So, a year later despite repeated letters and phone calls, the grill sits in my garage, unused and unassembled. Beware!"
4,swiss boarding school rock.,"It's an unusual selection for the overall tone of the movie. But crazily enough, the UK-imports so popular in North America right now (coldplay) mix very well with the Scandinavian greats such as jelly planet. However, this soundtrack doesn't contain all the tracks played in the movie, but they do a good job fitting some of the more memorable tracks on there. From the feel good anthem by Travis to the sullen dejected track, ""dont panic"" by coldplay. It all manages to pull itself off quite nicely, and like all movie soundtracks, you can pinpoint the moment that each track is played. A personal favourite is the Red House Painters track. Check it out."
3,"Interesting, but useless!","I enjoyed this book very much and it was very easy to read. But it didn't really teach me much. The ""vocabulary"" is very limited and information on how to actually read Japanese is pretty much non-existant - it's more a guide on how to recognize occasional characters. If you are curious about the writing system or are travelling to Japan and just want the thrill of recognizing a few characters, this book will be good for you. If you are a serious student beginning a life-long journey of learning to read and write Japanese, I would recommend A Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters by Kenneth G. Henshall."
4,Reads like a story,"As advertised, this book is a solid introduction to about 300 common kanji. Walsh wrote the book with a flow that allows you to read it like a story. The characters are explained in terms of the evolution from ancient Chinese drawings to modern kanji. Walsh also gives the various pronunciations of each, as well as examples of how you will see them in context.My primary criticism is the lack of an index or headings. Walsh will say, ""the following are based on animals,"" where a heading would be more functional. Along with the lack of an index, the book cannot easily be used as a quick reference.However, I highly recommend this for anyone interested in the basics of kanji. It is an excellent first step before moving on to more advanced study."
5,Funk from the Dirty South!!!,"Yes, these boys started out as Situation Stated with ""Girl I Love You""!! And look at them now!! Blowing it up!!! I love you Stanley!!!!! You guys keep up the good work and represent down south!!!!!"
5,This is the best song I've heard since I wanna freak you.,"Liberty City has a unique style their voices are brilliant. 24/7 is the best song since Jodeci ""I Wanna Freak You"". I'm looking forward to hearing more of their songs."
4,The Hockey Machine,"This book is a good book, I recommend it to others. It has adventures and is about hockey.If you like hockey, adventure or mystery's you would like this book.It is a fairly easy book to read and not difficult to follow the story line."
5,"My ""gift"" was a winner.","I bought this book for a friend--who is a real computer ""guru."" I figure it has to be a winner. I gave it to him and as he flipped through the pages, I kept hearing, ""Aha!"" ""So that's why..."" ""Okay, if I do...."" He didn't talk at all that afternoon. Just read the book. I'd say it was a winner."
4,"great info, BUT that CD is NOT the Book!","When I saw the book and CD together I assumed it was the book on CD so a nice search could be done. But its just demoware. The info in this book is awesome, but with obscure windows errors a nice CD search is easier than thumbing through the index in the back of a book, hoping you home in on that topic. They shouldnt put a CD in the picture with the book, its misleading."
2,Tedious,"This book is filled largely with the type of article you'd read part of while waiting in the doctor's office, and never lament not being able to finish it (or even recall you had started it). Though there are certainly a few gems, I found so many of the stories boring, meandering, droll. The couple that are meant to be humorous are altogether unfunny. And almost NONE of them is actually about travel.Skip this book. If you want a collection of stories resplendent with what it is that calles to a traveller's soul, try Wanderlust from the editors of Salon.com."
5,Very well built,"I've been using the Fellowes Excutive Keyboard Tray for a couple weeks now and find it works well.The system is easy to install, but quite heavy. I don't have much arm strength and I actually needed help carrying this upstairs to my desk. The heaviest part is the metal runner. It's designed to be able to withstand lots of keyboard smashing (works great for sending out those angry messages to customer service for instance). I installed the tray onto my wood desk and I expect it to hold up well.I use a standard size keyboard, so I didn't encounter many of the problems other people experienced. The mouse and keyboard trays adjust easily and seamlessly. The wrist support is comfortable.If you're looking for an easy to use, adjustable keyboard/mouse tray, this one works very well."
4,"Sturdy, Versatile and Clean","The Fellowes Professional Executive keyboard Tray is all that I could ask for. Much sturdier than anything I have used before, it can be adjusted to any height or angle with the pull of a lever. The suspended mouse pad is also perfectly situated. Nice product."
5,Very sturdy and installs in minutes,"I installed this on a set of cabinets that I built. I have a front face of about 1.5 inches that extends below the bottom of the cabinet top so I glued and screwed a piece of wood on the underside so that the tray-slide is even with the bottom of the cabinet front face. I then mounted the keyboard tray, instructions are easy to understand, and it works great.The tray holds its position very well, even when you are resting your hands on the keyboard. The tray can be easily lowered or raised by tilting the tray forward. As other reviews have stated, you want a good 22 inches from the back of the cabinet to the cabinet face to mount it."
5,Sturdy,"Product is very sturdy, and slim enough to stay out of the way when I don't need my keyboard. I don't use the mouse tray because it seems to small for me, I just keep my mouse on my desk. My keyboard is not huge, but it is larger than normal, and it fits without any issues.It took about an hour to install on my desk, which is a normal laminate/particle board office desk."
4,Built well...,"Very easy to install, quality is good. Make sure you measure your desk ahead of time.. Tray slides smoothly. Well built and easy to adjust."
2,Flimsy,"It keeps temperature ok but the min/max feature is useless . The needles are too loosely affixed and move with the slightest bit of a breeze or movement . If you keep it inside where there are no vibrations or dogs or children running , you may be okay."
2,Not the Same Quality,"This is the second thermometer I have had of this model. The first one worked well and lasted for several years. This device seems to have been produced by a different manufacturer. It reads several degrees too warm as compared with other known good thermometers. The high - low indicators are loose on their pivot and swing freely and therefore are always wrong. I liked this thermometer design, but the build quality is so low that the device is unusable."
2,Experience with Min/Max thermometers,"We had a Min/Max thermometer 20+ years ago which was about 12 inches in diameter and in a metal housing. It was far sperior to this unit. While this unit measures the temperature accurately enough, the reset needle is much too sensitve when you try to reset the stops. The mounting bracket is much too dificult to set up and I bent the screws trying to get it mounted. Then when my wife was attempting to rest the dials they somehow got stuck with both indcators on the same side of the needle. The worst thing is, that due to its small size, you cannot read it from more than a couple of feet away."
2,Doesn't work as described. SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"Simply put, this doesn't work. If you put it in the sunshine, the temperatures recorded are way over any sort of reality. I got readings of 110 degrees when I know the weather in LA never went above 72 that day. So why bother to have a thermometer if it doesn't tell you the truth or something reasonably close to it?"
2,So-so,I purchased this thermometer for my husband about 1 year ago. The 'high temp' and low temp needles have never worked as they are both on the same side of the temperaturen needle. It appears that all of the needles are bent just enough that they do not work as described. The red temp needle seems to be accurate. This was high priced for what we got.
3,1 out of 2 good,"This was to replace an identical thermometer of twenty five years, but the indicater pointer was against the clear plastic causing a circular scratch and the draghands are sloppy on the shaft so they dragged on the back plate, also causing reseting near impossible because the min and max would contact each other, but it did look cleaner than my old one. Some adjustments have been made so we can utilize this thermometer. This was the first of two we ordered. The second had the same etch line on the face plate, but with minor adjustment it was allowed some clearance. To us it indicated poor quality control compared to our original. Have a good day. Thank you."
1,It's a pop coaster just like the game. I just wish to god I could cuss,I got this piece of junk with the Sudeki game. I hate this cd just like I hate the dumb ^%&* game. It's Just as crappy as the piece of junk game. I want to know who in the &*^* will buy this piece of junk. I wouldn't even wish this dumb piece of ^%&* CD or game upon my worst enemy. Just a piece of junk. Well at least it makes a hell of a pop coaster.
5,Awesome record,"This record is a masterpiece. Every song begs to be listened to again and again. The instrumentation perfectly enhances Ned's tremendous voice. Shine Like A Diamond On Me is a gem, the lyrics painting a picture of lonliness. I Stole is a great sing along than any working man can identify with. The growth from Circus Liquor to iStole shows what a talented song writer and musician Ned is. The world needs to take notice of this sadly underrated fretless wizard!"
3,"Well, the best books need a plot...","The main problem with this novel is its complete lack of continuity. There's no plot, so the story consists almost entirely of flashbacks of the childhood through adulthood experiences of the two narrators (Saroja and Kamini, who are mother and daughter.)TAMARIND WOMAN is not meant, however, to be a thrilling tale, but rather an in-depth look at the tangled relationships of family life -- especially the inextricable bond between mother and daughter -- and in this it does succeed. It is not deeply psychological or intellectual (perhaps thankfully), but it is warm and well written, and ultimately very worth reading, especially for Baudami's loving and skillful portrait of her Indian culture."
3,Can do away with all the foreign words,"Tamarind Woman is a beautiful story although the main plot has been done over and over in the past few years by a number of authors: relationship problems between mother and daughter. I think the author has overdone the use of foreign words (Indian words) and can easily push away certain readers. In one page alone, I counted six Indian words with no reference whatsoever to their meaning or origin. I love reading novels that take place in another country or are written by foreign authors being a foreigner myself but the use of words in Tamarind Woman was a little too much and can make the reader feel a bit lost in the journey."
2,Annoying,"As stated by a previous reviewer, this novel started off good but slowly got wallowed down by miscommunication. I felt that there was enough outside conflict to take away the problems with the main characters' inability to talk about their feelings. After awhile, it became so emotionally draining to read about how miserable they were when all they would have to do is talk to each other! I have read other authors who have also used this ploy but it was drawn out for so long that it got tiresome. I have found this theme to be repeated in her novel His Lady Mistress as well."
2,The Dutiful Rake,"Harriet Klausner summarized the plot so I won't do that here, but her 5-star review is way off. I will say this novel had such a nice beginning. A spirited and independent heroine, and a masculine but not overly domineering hero who was attracted to the heroine without really wanting to be. Well, all that burnt out real quick, and the heroine somehow became timid, and easily led into stupid situations, while the hero became thick-headed and unreasonable.I don't like novels where it's obvious that just a simple conversation between the two main characters will clear the air and resolve their differences -- and they never have that conversation until the last five pages of the book. (Sigh.) This is not a horribly bad story, and it's not badly written, but I got more and more annoyed with the plot and with the characters as I read on. I just think Ms. Rolls is capable of much better storytelling than this."
3,Poorly-written and painful to read,"This book is simply arduous to read. I kept looking to the ""About the Author"" section for a hint that perhaps this was a translation from the Russian original, or something. Vague sentences, paragraphs, and overall structure haunt this book, and make it a task to read. Did this book even have an editor?"
5,Very Good Book - a Must read,We @ S7 boasts ourselves as porting GURUs mainly to all flavors of Unix and we have this book as a must read for all engineers that we take on board. I strongly suggest this book to anyone who is trying to or planning to port their sofware.www.s7solutions.com
5,Good Choice of Episodes,"I would love to see this whole series on DVD, but was happy to get just this small amount on one DVD. I watched some Welcome Back Kotter episodes as a kid and even now, as an adult, I think they are just hysterical. Great fun for a small amount of money!"
4,classic show,"I always found this show enjoyable as a kid and they include some good episodes on this DVD. If you were a fan of welcome back Kotter, then you will probably enjoy this DVD. Its definately worth the price."
1,not very funny,"i remember this show in the 70's & so i wanted to see how it stood up after 30 years. the truth is that it's not very funny!shot in video (ugly on the eyes !), the biggest novelty is seeing travolta in the role that propelled him to stardom !the clothes are pretty cool though !"
5,Classic comedy at its best,"Growing up watching Kotter, I miss such comedy in today's shows. I introduced it to my kids who are born in the 2000s, not the 70's, and they love it! Great humor, great comic timing and a lot of fun for the family. If you are in for good punchlines with a decent back story, this is it."
4,good but not as good as i remembered,i guess it's true with a lot of things. i remembered loving this show as a teenager so i bought it. it was good but i think my memory of it was better. i was glad i bought it though.
4,awesome,"Its nice to see an old tv series. Wow...what memories! I remember watching Welcome back, Kotter as a kid. They need to bring back more shows like that."
4,Welcome Back (Pilot) Welcome Back (Pilot),"Welcome Back (Pilot) just the way it was back in the old days. if i have to write a lot of words, i probably won't be reviewing a lot of things."
3,I remember when.,"This is so silly and so ""back in the day""! I laugh with every episode.True enjoyment."
2,Bad Episode Picks.,"Really missed seeing this show. Doesn't seem to get as much air time as it used too so I thought this compilation would be just perfect. This show and a few others are out on this ""Television Favorites"" collection. Maybe it's just me but I basicly expected the episodes picked to be the best and most favorite one's. I was alittle let down by the episodes on here because I could remember so many great one's that were ignored."
4,Great introduction to traditional Persian music.,"This compilation introduces the listener to many of the instruments, styles, and sounds of Persian music. Strings, woodwinds, percussion and vocals are all represented. The accompanying booklet is also very informative for those interested in the history and the theory of the music. This CD provides a glimpse into some of the world's most beautiful traditional music."
3,Fast Paced Sequel to Code of the Lifemaker,"Twelve years after publishing ""Code of the Lifemaker"", Hogan followed the steps of that success with this sequel. The main characters are back (with Karl Zambendorf at the top of all of them) and also the background is set on Titan.Being asked to write this sequel by his publisher, Hogan responded that he did not want to as he had effectively finished the story on ""Code of the Lifemaker"". Nevertheless, the publisher insisted and Hogan intelligentely found a thread from the first novel to follow an adventure which has weight enough to carry on the story.Although the charm and originality of the initial situation has faded, Hogan compensates with a fast-paced adventure and a satisfactory conclusion to what can be labelled as the series of ""Zambedorf on Titan"".Rating=3"
3,It was OK,It was somewhat helpful. I was really looking for info re stringing a mandolin hopeful this would include attaching the strings to the tuning pegs.
4,"Very helpful for beginners. Good reference, too.","Very helpful for beginning XML. Starts at the beginning explaining what XML is for. Also, this is a great reference of all the tags and syntax. I bought two books for XML before this and didn't like them too much. I haven't used them since I got this one. I really like this book!"
1,Avoid this one,"This is the worst XML documentation I've run across, online or on paper. I am not a total beginner with XML, I didn't expect this book to be a tutorial, and I picked up this book because it seemed like it would get to the point quickly. At first it seemed promising because of its brevity; then I realized that it was written very sloppily. In the Overview (chapter 1), the first mention of a DTD (with no explanation of what it's an abbreviation of), states ""XML supports but does not require DTDs"". Great. Good thing I knew what a DTD was, because this book wasn't going to tell me. Four pages later, the book tells me, ""As you have already learned, a DTD defines rules for document contents."" Well, I sure didn't ""already learn"" it from this book! Amazing that it references prior material that it doesn't contain! The rest of the book is more of the same. Very poor."
4,Good thing to have on your shelf - could be better,"First of all, this is a book for people who know their stuff and need to be able to go an extra mile without spending an hour wading through deteriorating Web. Even tutorial part is for people who know and understand a lot and that is how it should be for a book which is already too heavy.Things that could be better - information on case sensitivity of Xpath functions and patterns, marking up which stylesheet elelments are in CSS1, which in CSS2 and which in neither, more complete table of Unicode character references (to include full ASCII for example including interpunction), 8-bit Character set tables and mapping to Unicode, font, leading, and even margins could be a level smaller to make book thinner, lighter and more dense for everyday use, the ""Releted Properties,Objects etc."" could go to a small print to both not eat up the space and be faster to spot when needed."
1,Inappropriate Title,"The book does NOT teach anything about XML. It is just a syntax reference, that too not very handy. Complete waste of money."
2,Travel Mug 18oz is really 12 1/2oz,"The ""generious"" 18oz capacity listed in the description is realy more like 14oz, less the 1 1/2 oz of space required for the cover so it won't over flow. It's only leak proof if you get the cover on perfectly wich wouldn't be a big deal except it's almost impossible to align the inside threads of the cover once hot liquid is poured into the cup. Don't seem to have the problem when the cup is empty. So I would say if the cup is empty, it's leak proof. The handle is ackward to hold, and drinking from the bevel shaped lid is a challenge not to let it spill from the lower sides. The lever used to close the drinking spouts is difficult to use especialy after it's wet from sitting in coffee while you drink. On a positive note it does seem to keep the coffee hot longer than the cheaper plastic travel mug."
4,Travel Mug,"Does not leak, just as advertised. The top of the cover is not one level. It has two higher sides and two lower sides, sort of like a wave around the top of the mug. This makes drinking a bit tricky. I actually poured coffee all over myself at work last week. But the liquid does flow well when the stopper is in the open position. When the stopper is closed it does not leak. When the top is screwed on the two higher sides are not in position to offer a good drinking position, thus the spillage as described before. If yours tightens with the higher side in the correct drinking position you should have no problem. I typically drink the entire contents in about 3 hrs, and the coffee stays warm for about 1 hour of that time, and that's with pre-heating the inside of the mug with hot water before adding my coffee. Overall its not bad if not spilling is your main goal."
3,Not as great as I thought,"So the mug is pretty good. If I recently took a sip and close it, the mug still leaks... Also it doesn't really keep coffee warm for mare than 1-1.5 hrs. Other than that I am happy with it. The size is good and it fits great in my cup holder."
2,Lid doesn't work,"I liked the size, colors and insulation, but I could never figure out how to open and close this mug."
2,Guarenteed leakproof lid and drinkproof,"Beautiful mug and the coffee stays hot. When they say leakproof lid, however, they really mean it. Even in the open position NOTHING comes out!!! Can't figure out if it is possible to adjust the lid. We have to drink our beverages with the lid off which defies to whole purpose of ""travel mugs"". I took advantage of the 5 year warrenty and the replacements had the same problem. Apperently as the gasket on the lid heats up it expands. Then the seal is just as tight as if it were in the closed position. We are very unhappy with this product and I wish to give it -5 Stars."
5,A Prized Possession,"I received one of these as a gift about 5 years ago because of my habit of spilling coffee all over the interior of my car. I have used it continually since then and it works great. The paint is starting to scratch off, but I'm pretty rough with it.It IS leak-proof, but only if you let the pressure equalize. That is, once you fill it with coffee, let it set a minute then open and close the lid to let the heated air escape.It does loose heat if you leave it open..as long as you re-seal after each drink, it works reasonably well.It is practically indestructable. I have dropped it on concrete more times than it cares to remember and it still works great. If I ever lost it, I would buy another one in a heartbeat."
1,Not so leakproof...,"My particular model, unfortunately, wasn't so leakproof; even with the lid screwed on as tight as it gets, it spills coffee at the lid's gasket... including during normal usage. In other words, as I'm carefully drinking coffee out of it, I end up with drops of coffee falling onto my tie.Bad design. Don't buy, unless you've got a dry cleaner as a friend."
1,Coffee gets cold very quickly,"Nice looking mug and No spills but, you better drink your coffee very fast. Terrible insulation system. Don't buy it."
2,Spade digs a hole,"This video is for B Western buffs only. Spade Cooley, who was a great fiddle player and band leader, produced some of his own pictures including these. They make B Westerns look like the production values of Gone With The Wind. However, he was one of the very few B Western stars that filled his movies with humor. They are comedies with Spade as the butt of the joke. He looks a bit like a shorter wider Roy Rogers, but unfortunately that's where any semblance to acting ends. I had fun watching these and remembering my childhood, but if you are looking for good B Westerns, pass on this."
4,"The book's pretty old, but for its time, not all that bad.","This book was written right before their last successful album (at least for awhile) was released, Spirits Having Flown. But it's quite thorough. It tells all about the brothers' beginning, when they left Australia to go to England for some success, all the way to the Saturday Night Fever story. Some things I never knew were that Barry married his producer's (Robert Stigwood), secretary. Robin married the Beatles' producer's secretary. Another thing is that they never knew for what type of a movie they were making the Saturday Night Fever songs for. They just produced their best in 2 weeks and handed it to Stigwood. They write all their songs in minutes to hours and can't even read music! There's alot to learn in this book, although you'd probably want to buy a newer book. Kim Stevens mentions that they probably won't split up again, but right after the 1981 album Living Eyes, they do. Much to learn in newer books, but not bad for its year."
5,CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER BOOK TO INTRODUCE A YOUNG ONE TO FROST,"This book is quite well done and gives a good representation of Frost's work. It of course in an introduction and the poems chosen hit the nail on the head. The illustrations are great and well fit the poem being addressed. There is a very nice introducion in the form of a simple biography of Frost in the front of the book which is quite useful. The addited comments by the Editor are quite good and thought provoking. I cannot recommened this one high enough.Some of the Poems included are, The Pasture, Rose Pogonias, A Girls Garden, Ghost House, Birches, Mending Wall, The Wood Pile and quite a number of others."
4,Poetry for Young People: Robert Frost,"Beautifully illustrated. I liked the separation of poems into seasons. I WAS disappointed that ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"" was not included!"
5,one must have frost,"what a great idea and what a great book. we need more frost and we need him now. take this out for a spin, pull over and muse of the trans. musings of a master.You spoke the word, it had to be,For you're the God of creativity.Before the sun you called forth light,The Earth then knew both day and night.Then with a word produced such thingsAs trees and flowers, birds with wings.Fish in the sea, cows, butterfliesA myriad creatures there besides.From the ground formed one like me,No stringed puppet, but created free.Free to worship, free to hate,To ignore, or to you relate."
5,for all ages,I'm a little surprised at the recommended age for this book. Perhaps they are thinking of children reading it for themselves. Parents and teachers enjoy reading these poems to children and talking about their own experiences. The book is a wonderful tool for helping preschoolers learn to love books as they relate the poet's imagery to their own experiences.
5,Time Travel Romance,"This romance is wonderful. The story line keeps you smiling, laughing, and crying. After you feel the full range of emotions you will not want the story to end. You will want to read every time travel romance you can by this author."
5,MUST READ!!!,"This was my 1st time travel book I've read more than 10 years ago... now I'm 29 and still very much in love with this book. I've collected all her time travel novels and I can't get enough of her stories. This book I've purchased so many times for misplacing it or lending to friends to read. I've lost it again...lol... and just wish that this book was an E-BOOK so I can carry it with me everywhere. The storyline is so good and sweet, the characters have so much personalities. I RECOMMEND this book to time travel romance readers. A very fine piece of art!!! ENJOY THIS BOOK!!!"
5,The best historical romance novel that will take your breath,"I didn't want it to end. This book is so powerful and mystic that you wish that you could become a part of it. Tears ran down my face as I finished the last page. Everyone may think romance novels are trashy, and some are, but this book is anything but. Time travel collides with history and passion making a great page turner that will touch your heart and soul. Definetly a keeper. Unfortunatly, I lost my copy, and regret it to this day, since I am unable to find this title anywhere else. Trust me, once you have this book, hold on to it."
3,Good quick start but definitely not enough for the exams,"As promised, this book gets you an outline of the basic information about the product in a nutshell very quickly -- I used it for the Proxy 2 exam and, since I was studying on lunch hours, it was worth the first lunch hour to use it to get a broad overview. But it was definitely bare-bones and insufficient for passing the exam; I had to read through a couple other Proxy 2 books and the on-line Microsoft documentation to really be prepared for the exam.I also used it for my Exchange 5.5 exam with the same general feeling -- if you're an IT professional you'll be able to use this to pick up a fair outline of the product's features and structures quickly, but you've got a lot of reading and practice to do before you're ready to test on it or to use it in the field."
4,Excellent as last minute pre-test review or as a refresher,"Used this one as well as the ""core exams in a nutshell"" alongside the hefty and verbally redundant 500+ pages Sybex guides and it makes a hard to beat companion to overview the exam materials or refresh the stuff from a long forgotten exam. Certainly helped me to mcse within 6 months."
3,Seems OK for General Overview,"Used the Core Exams in a Nutshell and was really looking forward to the Electives in a Nutshell. Used it for Proxy Server 2 as a final review and found it to be too general. Certainly not the info you need to pass, but a good introduction to what Proxy Server is. Hopefully it will be better for the other electives. -MCSE, soon +I, in Salt Lake City"
4,Covers material well,"This book is well worth its value. Not an all in one source for allyour materials, but definitaly a nice concentrated manual covering most of whats on the exams."
5,Excellent Review and Outline,"After relying heavily on the Core Exams in a Nutshell to pass the MCSE, I can testify to the effectiveness of that book. This one looks as good as the Core Exams book. I found the TCP/IP material to be a very good overview. In two pages Moncur gives a better explanation of subnetting than any other I have seen, including not just the usual table-based explanation, but also an explanation at the bit level.This book doesn't cover all topics in detail, you'll need another book, such as the NT Server Resource Kit for that. But it does cover -almost- everything, and is well written and easy to follow."
2,"Beef it up, please.",O'Reilly Series are great books but unfortunately this book is not as good as it was expected.It looks like publisher was in a great rush. I think it should be throughtly revised and updated.TCP/IP which is the most important component of electives is not properly discussed.
1,Extremely useless for the Electives.,"This book is not going to help you to pass the MCSE electives. At best, it is a very basic introduction to those topics. It is completely useless as an exam preparation guide. Its sister book is really good though."
1,Garbage.,This is the most worthless piece of fecal matter I have ever bought. Nothing functions well. It's like reading a bad book. No interactive elements. Totally Sucks.
5,A rousing high adventure,"Zane Grey pulled out all the stops on this tale of chasing wild mustangs, buffalo hunts, cougar hunts, and wild musk-ox. Follow the tale of a rag-tag band of plainsmen led by Col. Jones. A feisty, tough old man who will stop at nothing so he can rope (yes I said rope) a wild cougar and bring it back home. They are a breed of men whose resilience and spirit are the stuff of pioneers and mountain men. The kind of indomitable spirit that won the west, and is the subject of much of America's folklore. Along the way they endure seventy degree below zero blizzards, desert dust storms, starving Indians, and a harsh, yet pristine wilderness of incredible beauty. Zane Grey s depiction of panoramic landscapes such as the Grand Canyon is picturesque. One can almost smell the forest's and sense the loneliness of the wilderness. A great read that was hard to put down. Now for my next task which won't be easy. Picking out the next Zane Grey novel to get lost in."
1,Not what I was looking for,"I was looking for some good westerns and thought this would be a good choice since Zane Grey is a well known and renounded author of westerns. I have read many a tale of the old west and the plains and this one was dull and dragging for me. Could not wait to get threw I never quit a book until finished...but did put this one on ""fast forward"" with it and dropped it off my kindle as I have no interest in spending time with it again. For a better accounting of Plainsman stories try the autobiograhpy of Col William Cody. While we know he had a gift for embellishing the truth, at least it is an interesting story to read."
4,Reccommended by Richard,Fine reading as expected authored by Mr. Grey. Something that can reread several times without losing its flavor and mental effects. You can almost see the visualize the scenes in your mind.
4,Reads alot,"Zane Gray! This is classic stuff upon which the B grade American western movie was founded. You can forget comparisons with Eastwood and Cosner western films. Gray introduced them to the genre and they only tried to duplicate what he did. You can smell the sweat of the horse, feel the heat of the day and taste the dust of the trail in this tale. Film cannot capture the images of Zane Gray's narrative. Try more Zane Gray!"
3,To See - 5 Stars; To Listen To...,"The music is really great - love it. However, just sitting there and listening to this musical is, well, boring. A musical to me needs to tell a story, and if the songs don't really have a meaning, it's pointless. I want to be captivated! I want to be taken away in my mind to somewhere else! This musical just didn't do it for me. I imagine that sitting there in an audience watching this show would be really neat. But just listening to the CD was not enough for me to recommend this recording."
5,The best book on stage management ever written.,"I am an AEA stage manager and I teach stage management at two colleges. Kelly's stage management book is the only one I will use. Over the years I have purchased, and have been sent perusal copies of other books and none of them are even in the same league. If you want a geat resource book on stage management forget all others and buy this one. I'm so greatful it is back in print with a second edition."
1,There is no substitute...,There is officially no substitute for a gas grill because I owed both the gas and electric version of this one and the difference is astronomical... The gas version is one of the best grills I have ever owned... The electric is the worst...
2,"Great Initially, major fail after time passes...",We first got this grill 3 years ago (may 08). At the time the legs were stable the cooking temp could reach 500-600 without difficulty. By the next summer the legs started getting weak. The liner under the lid needed constant cleaning and most importantly the temp would barely break 450. Then last summer came along and the grill just refused to get hot. I took apart the heating element and was aghast at what I saw. The entire encasement was one big blob of plastic. The whole thing was melted to pieces. You would think the designers wouldn't use plastic so close to the heat! I will not buy a replacement part or buy a new grill until I hear that charbroil has addressed these issues.
2,Poor quality,"We had one for nine years. During that time ,it went thru a hurricane & flooding thus getting buried in mud under the house.. washed off and worked fine for a few more years.Purchased new one last summer. Quality can't compare: legs are not stable, side handle melted this summer (not due to excessive grill heat), drip pan doesn't work well. Very disappointing!"
5,Great compact grill!,"The average life of this grill is about 5 years. This is our 3rd of this same model. We love the electric grill, no fussing around with gas, lighter fluid or charcoal. The grate washes very easily. Does not dominate the covered patio area. The stores do not stock them anymore. It must be ordered online for pickup at a store or shipped directly to your home. We are a family of 2 and for our purposes the size is perfect."
1,poor quality- themostat controller,"The first char-broil patio grill I purchased worked quite well and lasted for several years. The replacement I purchased was very disappointing. In general, the quality of the second grill was not as good. But the bigger problem has been the thermostat. The first one burned out after less than 4 months and the replacement thermostate I purchased for $50 lasted less than 2 months. I am not investing any more money in this grill. I contacted customer service and they sent me another themostat and then it burned out too. They really need to fix this problem. They are lossing alot of business."
2,Good while it lasted,"I am disposing of this grill after the second extension cord/controller meltdown in two years. Enjoyed the grill while it lasted, but replacement parts are expensive and Char Broil customer service is not very helpful. Here is their latest advice, when the new extension cord melted after just two months of use: ""Thank you for contacting the grill service center. I apologize for the damage to your extension cord. The reason this part normally overheats is because of the heating element inside the grill. As this element starts to go out, it will actually overheat and cause the connection of the extension cord to melt. We advise that any time you replace your extension cord, you also would want to replace the heating element.""First I've heard about that. Why would I pay almost as much as a new gas grill to replace the parts on this electric model which is clearly defective? We also had to replace the enamel grill when it started flaking apart into our food after one month of use."
3,"Ok, hard to keep it hot enough","I had one of these for about three years. We used it fairly regularly, but found that it took a long time to preheat, was difficult to clean, had numerous grease fires in it, and would cool very quickly when the top was lifted off. It's ok, but I found I preferred to cook my meat in a cast iron grill pan on the kitchen stove over using the grill."
3,Patio Caddie,"Grill works well, but doesn't get as hot as it claims it will. Plus every time you take the cover off to flip the item, it loses heat fast. Still, it's a good value for those who don't want a gas grill or live in a townhome/appt complex."
1,"be careful, shoddy parts","amazon didn't publish my first review. this is a terrible grill. the grilling surface flaked metal and porcelain shavings all over our food.since we used amazon's positive reviews to make a purchasing decision, i want to make sure this experience is recorded too.look out if you buy this grill and make sure you don't have metal shavings in your dinner."
3,Char Broil Electric Grill,The grill is adequate for condo/apartment style living. The heating power seems to be adquate. I would recommend two things to make the product better. Number one would be to strengthen the three legs. I find them to be extremely wobbly. The second thing I would do is install some sort of hook or hinge that you can hang the top on or move it out of the way when checking the items being cooked.
1,Waste of time and money,"I'm not at all satisified with this grill. While assembling it, the porcelain coating on the body cracked off in most places where a fastener contacted it. I contacted the manufacturer and they agreed to replace the lower bowl (bottom half). They sent, instead, an aluminum liner which I didn't need. Char Broil has not replied to my four subsequent attempts to contact them.The grill will only get to 400 degrees instead of the necessary 600 that they recommend in their cooking instructions. Meat gets done, but you don't get that charred effect. I might as well cook it in the oven. I am very disappointed.Update: I finally got tired of buying replacement controllers and heating elements and bought another brand. The Char Broil went to the garbage where it belongs."
1,Poor Controller design,The temperature control on this grill is poorly desigmed and will overheat and melt the controller and all of the insulation off of the wiring. Check other reviews and look at the pattern. If you bought one of these more than a couple of years ago and are thinking of replacing it go to a brick and mortar store and look at the current model. It looks like the finish was applied with a slingshot. Save your money and look at other brands of electric grills. There are better ones available right here on Amazon.
2,substandard,The grill does not reach the advertised temperature. It requires that you cook items substantially longer than normally required.
4,Great Unit,"This is a great unit! I live in a high rise and it takes up very little space on the patio. It assembles easily and it cooks just great!If you can't have a gas unit, this is the way to go!!! Solid and dependable. Only draw back is the grill grate, would be better if it had a non stick surface. It is not a show stopper, but other than that it is a great grill!!!!"
2,Product Quality Not As Good As It Used To Be,"The Patio Caddie that we received was slightly damaged in shipping (although not badly enough to deal with the hassle of mailing back a return...just some denting). The bad thing about this grill is that it takes forever to heat past 400 degrees and no longer has a grate area to place little ceramic briquets, therefore, the insides will wear out in record time. This will be our last Patio Caddie."
1,Total Waste Of My Money,"When new, this grill did not get hot enough to sear the juices into the meat, which is what a good grill will do. Also, there was very little smoke flavor imparted to the meat. It was like grilling in the kitchen stove.The heating element failed after one season, so I invested in a new controller. The new unit worked once, and then failed completely. I have had cheaper electric grills that worked much better and lasted much longer.I do not recommend."
1,Disappointing,"The first char-broil patio grill I purchased worked quite well and lasted for several years. The replacement I purchased was very disappointing. In general, the quality of the second grill was not as good. But the bigger problem has been the thermostat. The first one burned out after less than 1 year and the replacement thermostate I purchased for $50 lasted less than 2 months. I am not investing any more money in this grill. I have since purchased another brand."
1,burned and melted plug,"after using it only 5-6 times the power plug at the top of the grill melted, whole grill overheated, was a big safety issue, there was no way to unplug it due to heat and possible shock hazard, stay away from this, it can burn your house"
5,best grille ive ever used,"don't have to use charcoal or propane, just plug in and use. comes with an accurate dial for easy use and a temperature gauge. hardly needs cleaning, and the easiest maintenance bbq out there. One of the best bbq's i have ever used. recommend to anyone who loves to cook."
1,DON'T BUY,"I've had this grill for a little over a year. I paid $189 for it. It worked like a champ for ONE SUMMER, now the controller is bad. Char-Broil tells me that it'll cost $90 to replace. Although I like the features of an elctric grill, fast heat and all, if you make such a CRAPPY unit that it doesn't last long and you don't stand behind it...I say I'll NEVER buy another Char Broil product again!"
2,not recommended,"within the first few months I had to have the porcelain grate replaced (do not use metal tools on it) and had to fight Char-broil to get it. It never got very hot so not useful in the winter. The latest is the cord melted or burned up. They want 60 bucks for a new one. Not going to happen. For the money this grill cost I expect it to last a lot longer than 2 years and actually work as advertised. I only wanted it to do simple things like hot dogs and hamburgers, oh well back to my trusty charcoal Weber kettle for those items."
3,Poor quality pieces,"We live in an apartment building that does not allow charcoal or gas grills, we decided to purchase this one. Many of our neighbors have it and the food always tastes great. We are in the process of putting ours together and I can tell you that the construction of the grill is extremely cheap... The screws that come with the grill to attach the accessories do not fit the brackets. So my husband ended up stripping the screws to fit them in. Overall this grill is very poor quality. I guess the old adage is true - they don't make things like they used to."
5,Char Broil Electric Grill,"It's clean, simple to use, safe, and grills as well or better than gas or charcoal grills."
1,PIECE OF GARBAGE!!,"Less than a year after purchase, this awful product overheated and melted one of the steel prongs to ash, also melting through the plastic on the temperature control unit and essentially destroying the whole product. Could easily have caused a fire if I hadn't been watching and noticed the grill wasn't cooking properly (all of the power was being used to melt the steel and plastic connections!) Buyer beware - this is a total fire hazard and piece of poorly built garbage. less than 1 star..."
3,"Okay, if electric is your only choice","I'm in a condo with a small deck. Rules won't allow propane. Didn't want to deal with the ash issues related to charcoal, so I went with this electric grill. Although it doesn't get as hot as I'd like, I have had success with a (medium rare AND seared) flank steak and with a cedar-plank salmon fillet. The design and construction is adequate - I have no doubt it could be improved. That said, my research didn't reveal any better electric grill alternatives."
3,Char-Broil Patio Caddie Electric Grill,The product size is perfect for two people. We have had to learn by usage to get the correct temperature and cooking times. The instructions say to preheat for 20 minutes to temperatures that we have never been able to reach even after an hour of trying to preheat. The manual says that at first the product may not reach desired temperature but it has been several weeks and numerous uses and it has never exceeded the temps from the first use and have never reached the temperature suggested by the manual. The product arrived with a dented lid inside the unsealed package. Considering previous Char-Broil purchases we expected more.
1,Char-Broil Patio Grill is bad news,"I have had nothing but problems with this item. It does not work as stated & the manufacturer will do nothing to help with any problems. Will not cook over 350 degrees. Dries your meat out. Defective parts. You have to assemble the item & the pieces do not fit together right. Very poor customer service. They will not answer your questions in a timely manner, so the time limit on the warrenty will expire & you cannot send it back. I should have looked at the BBB before thinking of purchasing. I would NOT recommended this product to anyone. Nobody needs such a headache. Costly lesson learned on my part."
5,As good as any grill I've ever used,When I bought my condo a month ago I was very disapointed to find out I could not set up a gas grill on my patio. I searched for a viable solution and found this grill at the Home Depot. They didn't carry it in stock and got a huge run around in trying to special order it so I just gave up. Then I thought to try Amazon. I ordered it and 5 days later had it set up on my patio. This grill gets HOT!! Which if you've ever used an electric grill in the past you know that they never get hot enough to really sear meats....this one was up to 600 degrees in about 15 minutes of preheating....I love this grill. A little more expensive than a gas grill but than again you don't need to buy a tank and have it filled several times over the season.
2,lousy design...,"I am now on my 3rd Char-Broil patio caddie! They've each lasted 2 years and then the plastic control knob melts! What kind of design do they have? Then again, I guess I need to stop ordering the grill, thinking they've improved the design. WHY would any engineer place a PLASTIC KNOB anywhere near 400-500 degree metal???? WHY??? I like the look of the new stainless steel version, but WILL NOT buy another until they design a control knob that won't melt!!! PLASTIC on HOT metal???? C'mon Char-Broil....get with the program and TEST your own grills!Don't buy if you're expecting this grill to last more than a couple of seasons.Also, a HINGED LID would be a real bonus, too!"
5,This is my third Char-Broil - excellent experience,"I have used this same grill several years and when it came time to replace it, I researched it and finally determined this is still the best grill for my particular needs. I also bought the same grill for my winter home in Florida. Excellent unit, but I found adding $5 worth of ceramic brickets makes it work better with more even heat overall. The food has a very nice ""char"" flavor, too. Even better, I also add hickory chips each time I start it. Wonderful flavor and great smells!My units sit outside and, therefore, I use the optional cover. This cover does a good job of keeping the grill clean and the quality is good. Very good overall value!"
4,HOOD ZOMBIES,"It's a different twist. It's not scary, not really gory, more comedy then anything. It's not funny throuhout the whole thing, but it's got it's moments.-Rent it, buy it if it's cheap. $5-$10.00-For $15-$20.00 it's not that good.-I would probably watch it again."
2,"Fun for a fan, but not too real","A Barry fan does not have much reading material to choose from when it comes to reading about him. However, this offers a look at Barry from the start to 1985...pre-""Copacabana: The Movie."" It has very few quotes from Barry & reads as if aimed to a young adult audience. Read it if you can't find anything else about Barry to enjoy! Better yet...put on ""Even Now"" and listen to what he feels through his music rather than relying on this for more about him!"
2,Just ok,"Love this scent, first became acquainted with it after staying at the Ritz Carlton. I think that the quality of this ""parfumee"" is low, I have body mists from Bath & Body Works ($12) that last longer than this fragrance."
2,Awkward start,"Ocean Colour Scene are absolutely brilliant. It is amazing to me that they are virtually unknown here in the States. They write, sing and play beautifully. They are always well produced but never over produced. This however is unlike anything else they have released. It is an awkward beginning at best. The songs show promise and that promise was realized in their subsequent releases. Where the performances are solid, the production sinks the recording. It is dated, slick and just a poor fit for the band's sound. If you must have them all, you will end up buying this. Otherwise, get any of the other releases they are far superior and all terrific. This is just not an essential recording."
3,Hoping for Something Different,"I bought this album after listening to Is She Coming Home and hoped there were similar tracks. There are, but it is mostly early 90's indie rock. The band has changed their sound since. A lot of the music reminded me of Echo and the Bunnymen's style. It's a good listen, just not great."
3,Scholarly review of Parsifal,"This is a good book so far as it goes. It's a bit dry, but if you are sufficiently interested in the material than you should be able to get through it OK.The book is divided into sections about Wagner's source material, a history of Parsifal performances, a musical commentary, a discussion of the critical reactions to Parsifal from Wagner's time to the present, and a proposed interpretation. In the ""interpretation"" section, the author argues that Parsifal must be interpreted as a religious work.I was disappoined with the book, because I was expecting a more detailed interpretation (for example, what actually happens in Act II of Parsifal?)The book is interesting, but was not quite what I was looking for. However, the chapter on Wagner's source material is a necessary prerequisite on forming your own opinion of this work, so those of you still grappling with this opera should consider purchasing this book."
1,IT IS NOT GENTLE AT ALL,"It is not gentle at all. It hurts wheneven it touches my face. I do not think this should be used on our face, too rough!!I contacted the seller, and the sellers said that he would refund me. But I never received the refund. I have all the mails between seller and me as record. BAD PRODUCT, BAD SELLER!"
4,Buf-Puf Review,"I bought this Buf-Puf for my 83 yr old aunt who has been looking and looking in all the stores for a new buf-puf like she has used for many years. Apparently they are no longer available in stores but I found one thru good ol' Amazon :-) They have everything! I'm assuming she likes it, she hasn't said anything to the contrary. It's a bit different, I think, than the one's she used to get but basically the same. She was thrilled when I gave it to her. Don't know how much this will help anyone except to know that you can find these here on Amazon if you've been looking."
3,phantom rickshaw,"old, old copy of to read it because k. reaspably good shape for one so ol d.some wear and tear, i'm"
1,Beware of what you're buying,"The series is great - fascinating work. However if you think you're paying $150 for the whole 5-part set, think again. The title says ""Working Shakespeare Video Library"" and does NOT mention that you're NOT getting the whole set - in other words, it is misleading advertising. The item being offered is ONLY Workshop 1 (Muscularity of Language: Motion and Rhythm), and they're charging $150.If you can get the whole set (and if you're serious about acting, or just seriously interested in acting), then this may be the very best instruction you'll find on video - I've gotten some of the other disks from a library, so I've seen most of them. But remember - from Amazon, you're paying $150 for WORKSHOP 1 ONLY. Don't be misled. They don't even seem to offer the other four disks."
2,I don't understand.....,"I heard Alice today (live) on a local radio station, and I was intrigued enough to then listen to cuts from her CDs. Frankly, I'm not impressed with her voice or singing style, though I share her environmental views.I can't recommend anyone buying her CDs, but her live performances probably are a cut above her recorded music. My suspicion is that she needs a more professional producer, with better editing and production skills."
3,Needed Re-set and Hose Connection,"When I rec'd this and plugged it in: nothing. However, due to the efforts of a kindly neighbor, who opened the case, and hit the emergency stop button and connected a hose that had not properly been connected, it started to work. This is why I am giving it a 3 star -- maybe a bad day on the assembly line?However, I have used it quite a bit since and no problems."
5,Great music performed extraordinarily well,"My introducation to the music of Dmitri Kabalewsky was through the old Horowitz recordings of the 3rd sonata (both live and studio version) and some of the preludes. The music here is not as phantasmagoric as Scriabin, not as lush as Rachmaninov, and certainly not as ""modern"" as Prokofiev. Yet Kabalewsky is very original and falls within the Romantic range of Russian pianism. His music evokes various moods that might remind one of Prokofiev but there also seems to be an element of the fantasy there as well, especially in the preludes. The Sonatas are tight pieces well worth frequent performances on today's concert stage. The pianist, Wolfram Schmitt-Leonardy, is excellent with this music and plays it to the hilt. The sound and recording quality is very good as well. In all, a worth while CD for pianophiles looking for something new and good."
1,Not what's shown,The thermometer I received looks nothing like the picture. In fact doesn't look much like a sunflower. At least its cheap.
4,Hot! Hot! Hot!,"Hot! film. Reminded me a little of the film, ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", with the actors: Gael Garcia Bernal, Diego Luna, and Maribel Verdu. See the scenery on the road trip and life at the beach town of Mancora. Lust, loss, and redemption."
2,On Fire? Barely.,"Only 20% of this book is related to the fire service and it is adequately written at best. The rest is a rambling bore. Akin to a teenager's journal, it is witless, slipshod prose about the author's pets, drunk driving, raising rabbits, hunting, fishing, and the like. Mind you, I would be delighted to read about firefighter's off-duty life if it was interesting and well-written. This is neither."
2,"If you want to become a vegetarian, read this book.",It certainly isn't about firefighting. It's more about man's inhumanity to animals and the careless ways in which we treat them. If you care anything about animals this book will break your heart.
1,Very Disappointing and Grievously Boring!,"I thought this author would share his experiences of life as a firefighter; I thought wrong. He shares more about his dog not being able to produce puppies than he does about the various accidents and fires he has been a part of. I was shocked by how much he digresses, over and over again he talks about animals which have absolutely nothing to do with firefighting or even his life! The author has written a book that will put the most astute reader to sleep. I wish it had been a bit more interesting, but alas, it was not."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"As a professional firefighter I have read many books on firefighting - both fictional and true accounts. ""On Fire"" is a waste of time and money. Mr. Brown is a poor representative of the typical firefighter. He lacks the pride associated with this profession - both on and off duty. After putting this book aside, I remember only things such as Mr. Brown's drinking, home life activities, and his poor writing style. Your time (and money) are better spent reading ""Report From Engine Co. 82"" by Dennis Smith."
2,I don't get the hype,"As a lover of Southern fiction (Faulkner, O'Connnor, Styron, etc), I just don't get the praise for Larry Brown. To me, he writes like an imbecile. I do not exagerrate: I see an embicile in my head when I read each line, like maybe Carl Shivers from Sling Blade. His memories are so inane that they should hardly be shared (I watched a man jog past the firestation...)and his writing is so basic and abscent of color. Like bad Hemingway more than anything.Skip it and go read some Cormac MCcarthy."
5,AWSOME CAMERA FOR THE PRICE!,"I HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT CAMERAS INCLUDING THE SANYO-FISHER CAMERACORDER FVD-C1 WHICH COSTS $750 BUT THIS MX4 TAKES VIDEO JUST AS GOOD @ 640X480 WITH 30 FPS AND EVEN BETTER PICS @ 4MP COMPARED TO 3.2 ON THE FISHER! AND I PAID LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE! THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST VALUE DIGITAL STILL/VIDEO CAMERA ON THE MARKET, THE VIDEO LOOKS ALMOST AS GOOD AS MINI DV AND THE STILLS ARE ALMOST AS GOOD AS MY MINOLTA DIMAGE 7i, ALL I CAN SAY IS YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS CAMERA FOR UNDER $300 !"
4,Great camera; average video,"Have been using MX4 for 3 months now. I have a couple other digital cameras (Kodak and Canon) . The MX4 has the most features. Several thing I especially like: 10x optical zoom, 0mm close-up, manual aperture/shutter support, movable LCD screen.Cons: MPEG4 video is not smooth and the autofocus is slow. The video format is Quicktime. I wish it uses Divx format, so I can play the videos on Divx DVD players (e.g. Philips 642). In program mode, the photo is a little dark. With the flash, the photos are too bright and some times over-exposed.Overall, I am happy with my purchase. It's the best digital camera you can get for under $300."
3,Promise Ring Fans Read,"This album may seem EXTREMELY terrible at the first get go.... The first three songs on this Marimtime album are not very strong. In fact, you will be shaking your head wondering why you bought this album as the third song ends. Thankfully, the fourth song ""King of Doves"" is truly spectacular. Songs 5 and 6 are also very good. Don't fall for the hoopla on the song Adios. It is almost unlistenable. The lyrics are absolutely horrible, and the song itself is uncomfortably embarrassing to listen to. But songs #10 and #11 are very solid, and the album itself grows on you and is really pretty damn good. Skip the first three, say adios to adios, and what you have is a very good album. It is NO Woodwater, by any means, not even close, but if you skip past the song Adios, and the first three, you have yourself a nice listen.Adios,Gatto"
1,False Advertising,The image depicted in the ad is for a wood grained back board but in the Title/Descriptor the vendor states 90114 White Thermometer.The image falsley suggests that the item for sale is a wood grained item when in fact it is a much less attractive white plastic item.Let the Buyer Beware!!!
1,"Wrong image, and a piece of junk.","I'll back up the other reviewers - the actual thermometer is white plastic. Additionally, I had it mounted in my kitchen for less than six months before the outside temperature gauge broke - in December it suddenly said it was about 100 degrees outside. The inside thermometer still works, so I haven't thrown it out, but what a piece of junk!"
1,Worst Sales Misrepresentation ever !,"The thermometer I have in my house is exactly representative of what is in this photo... the PN matches and everything... However, what they sent looks NOTHING like what I wanted as a direct replacement. What was sent was just a white dual thermometer, one that's sold in every store for $10 or less. Very dissatisfied... requires totally different mounting screws/locations, looks not what I wanted... totally misrepresented ! If I could put an actual picture with this file I would"
5,Winter Passing DVD Movie,"I'm a very huge fan, of Will Ferrell's movies. Over many years I collect every DVD Will Ferrell was in it. And the best thing, that Will Ferrell always play interesting character. Just let you know that in this movie Will Ferrell does not play a funny act. Its almost serious, but very interesting. Trust me, it will not disappoint no one. Sense the all cast is great. And the actors played so well. I hope you will enjoy this film."
4,Winter Passing...it gets slower every year.,"This was a wonderful movie! It made a great Christmas present for a friend of mine!! I'd recommend it to anyone. Simply because, anyone can relate to this movie."
3,A good movie to watch...,The acting is great and the plot is good. There just seemed something missing from this movie to make it 4 stars. It got a little slow for 30 minutes after the half-way point. A good movie to watch.
2,I wanted to slap all these people,"Mostly annoying, whiney film about a J.D. Salinger-type character and his whiney, entitled, annoying little brat of a daughter. The eccentricities on display just got on my nerves. Will Ferrell is mildly amusing as a weirdo who lives with the crazy author. Nice indie rock soundtrack, though."
2,Depressing,"I thought this was a depressing film. Ferrell was good, but the character of Resse, her father, and others was so bleak and dreary that it truly made this a miserable evening. Full stop."
1,I Was Horrified,I was horrified to see the Zooey Deschanel character drown a kitten early in the film. I took out the dvd and threw it in the trash. Do not watch this film if you have any human feelings.
5,Shakina Glory,"Once in a decade, you stumble upon a CD where each song smells of the Lord God Almighty. Where track by track you see the face of God a little bit clearer. Where you remember that we were created to worship the King of Kings. Where you are left with a desire to share this gift of salvation with your family, best friends, and even enemies. A New Walk calls a cloud of glory (aka Shakina glory) that reaches from the heavens to your radio and surrounds you with the glory of Jesus Christ. All you can do is fall on your face and praise the Lord. The music on this CD will send you back into the world and the word of God seeking the Face of God and the Glory of His Son Jesus Christ. Add this CD to your collection and Be Blessed."
3,This okay if you can get a signal,"Tried using this with my older sirius home radio, but my radio died so it didn't workout so good. I also couldn't get a good signal. That could have been because my receiver was dying. So keep searching for a better review."
2,It's just not Bile!,"I bought this album even though it didn't have any reviews and I can say I am that happy I did. I wasn't even aware that it was a solo album produced by the vocalist Kriztoff. It sounds nothing like Bile and in fact I am suprised they let it even use there name. Some of the songs are strangely amusing but for the most part it's just a bunch of abstract sound with some beats thrown in. Which by it's self could be all right, but combined with the cleaned up vocals and lack of aggression it just left me disappointed. The only two songs that I found to be tolerable were ""venom on my breath"" and ""love Stinks"". If you like Bile, buy a BILE cd and just pass on this one."
4,It is like slipknot,This band has a heavy meatle sound and is like the famouse slipknot. I like this band and i hope that it does not becom trendy.
5,Mr.Popper's penguins,"Mr.Popper's penguins is where Admiral Drake sends Mr.Popper two penguins.The Popper;s are very poor so they act for people to make money.Mr.Popper goes to the wrong theater and has to go to jail.They would earn $5,000 a week. My favorite part is when Captin Cook eats a goldfish out of the fish bowl."
5,This It was a great book and I would read it again.,"I realy enjoyed this book because my favorite anamal is a penguin. Most of the time it was pretty funny,and it kept me laughing. I thought that Richard Atwater has a verry good emagenation and knows whats funny about penguins."
2,Mr. Popper's Penguins,"It was hard for me to get interested in this book. I was bored with it and really didn't want to finish it, but since our school requires our students to read it, I needed to read it so I would know more about the book. If I had been given a choice about what book to use to teach reading skills, I would have chosen a different one."
5,Absolutely Timeless...,"I first read this book about 50 years ago, while in grade school. Through the decades since, I had forgotten many of the details and nuances of the book but I never forget how much I enjoyed it. In the early days of eBay, when one could conjure the most obscure memories from youth and do a search to see if anyone was auctioning a related item, I found a copy of this book and won it in auction. Upon receipt, the memories flowed back like water!I am so glad this book is readily available once again for a whole new generation of arm chair explorers and adventurers!Buy It, Read It, Enjoy It. It has settled into my head as truly one of the nicest life-long memories ever!"
4,Mr. Popper's Penguins,"Mr. Popper's Penguins starts out by introducing us to the main character, Mr. Popper, a man with a wife and two children to support. But Popper is a lowly housepainter who works only from the spring to fall. But our protagonist will soon be surprised with a gift from the artic that will change his life and make him a tad bit richer.One day after realizing that a radio show about an arctic expedition is about to come on, Mr. Popper listens and becomes surprised about what he hears. One of the admirals on the mission thank him for a letter and then tell him of a surprise he will recieve. Popper gets a penguin in the mail soon afterward. Read on to find how the penguin becomes twelve and how our hero makes some money off his feathered friends.The Atwaters' Newbery Honor winning book will please any 8-12 year old out there. The adorable penguins are sure to charm, much like Sterling North's Rascal. 'Penguins' is a classic!R"
4,Captain Cook,"""Captain Cook!"" This book made me want to read word for word. I wanted to read this book and made me flip pages past my bedtime.Mr.Popper the house painter sends a letter to a radio show. Mr. Popper wins a pet penguin for sending that letter. Mr. popper up for a treat. What will happen to poor Mr. Popper? The author messages is that penguins belong in Antarctica, even though penguins are very smart and are great dancers. It also tells you you may love and charish animals. I loved this book so much I read this book three times. Richard Altwater is a very talented author."
2,"Sounds like a good book, but disappointing","Mr. Popper's Penguins is a good book for some people, but it wasn't quite then right book for me. However, it would be a good read-aloud book. It was very interesting. It had lots of details. You have to have a lot of imagination to make this book good.This book is about 12 penguins, Mr. And Mrs. Popper and their children, Janie and Bill. They become famous by doing performances all over the world. It is kind of a long book. Sometimes the details get a little old. I would only read it again if I had to. So, it wasn't too interesting to me, but others like it a lot. I'm looking forward to watching the movie; I'm hoping it's better than the book!"
4,MR. POPPERS PENGUINS,"MR.POPPERS PENGUINS a phenomenal book hilarious written by Richard and Florence Atwater. This book is great. It is about a man called Mr. Popper, a house painter who loves the artic. He also wants a penguin as a pet. This great realistic fiction book. I loved it because it's humorous because of the penguins in showbiz. I recommend it for all ages."
2,Disapponting,"Without reading it first, I chose this book to be part of my son's summer book club, because I thought it would be fun for the kids to read the book and then go see the movie. I read the book on the way to and from a SF Giant's game (Go Giants!) and was extremely disappointed. The story was dry and lacking in character development. The book zipped through events with very little detail. I honestly think that if this book were submitted to a publisher now, that it would be rejected. It's a cute idea for a book, but the writing was not what I expected for a story that was made into a movie and praised so highly by so many people."
5,Fabulous book,"Mr. Popper's Penguins is an excellent book for any child, or adult, who has a great imagination and likes to laugh. The things that happen to the Popper family and their penguins make for a great read."
4,Popper is so silly,"This book was completely silly, fun and light-hearted. Great for children and adults alike. The reader Nick Sullivan did a fantastic job making each and every character and penguin come to life in the reading. There was music and sound effects that helped with the ambiance as well. An overall great audio book experience.The story on the other hand is a bit dated and some of the penguin information is now found to be misleading. We all know that the male is the one who takes care of the egg and that there are penguins living in other place than the South Pole. If your children read this book we just need to make these things clear to them if they ask. Also, I was quite disappointed that Mr. Popper never stood up for himself and let himself get pushed around by people he didn't even know. Mr. Popper was a very kind man who never wanted to cause harm to anyone. I guess it was a lesson on turning the other cheek, but man I would have yelled at the lady on the street, she was so mean!"
3,poor quality,"I did order the book for my child, it took a long time to arrive, compare to other purchases I made online coming from different USA places. As soon as I opened the book, pages start falling apart, not very happy about that. The book is good. Just not happy with the quality, and amount of money I paid for my purchase.Thanks."
4,Made the mistake of buying the book instead of the movie.,"But overall, the book was a great mistake. It made an amazing bedtime story for the kids, and it put them to sleep faster than reading out of a dictionary."
5,Great Book,Just finished reading this book with my 4th graders! They absolutely loved it! They wanted to keep reading and not put the book down!
2,my kids lost interest,i read 1/2 of this one aloud to my kids (7 and 10). it really didn't capture their interst so i finished the second half without them. cute story. i enjoyed the antics of the penguins.
4,Fun Book for Kids,"**spoiler alert**This was a very cute book, right up to the end. I loved that Mr. Popper ultimately tried to do what was best for the penguins, but it annoyed me somewhat that he left his family. I would have enjoyed the ending more if they had been able to choose whether or not to go, or at the very least, he had been able to discuss it with Mrs. Popper. I get that it's a children's book, but the idea of them discussing everything up to that point regarding the penguins, then having him decide in the split second between learning that Admiral Drake intended for him to go and actually setting sail seemed completely counter to how their relationship worked. I'm probably putting a lot more thought into the story than kids would, but little details like that make or break good books, and in this case, what otherwise would be a 5-star classic is, instead, somewhat wanting."
4,If You Buy the Premise,"It's all built on a single joke. If you buy the joke, (the old penguin-out-of-water story), the book is great fun. If that doesn't charm you or amuse you or at least hold your interest, then the book can be heavy going. (Just like Jim Carrey movies, as it turns out.) It has some strange sour moments, (family money troubles and the like), and is in the ""dad's nutsy obsession"" tradition, which can be fun or not depending on your mood and your inclination.But, that all said, it is well written, it zips along, and it has a certain goofy charm. Certainly a nice addition, and a still-accessible old fashioned volume, to have on the family shelf."
4,Mr. Popper's penguins,I gave Mr. Poper's penguins four stars because it was a great book but a little confusing. It was a great book because it just caught my interest. I usually don't like to read but this book I really loved. It was confusing because at first I didn't get how many penguins he had and I also didn't get why they fired him because his penguins got loose and interrupted another act.Other wise it was an awesome book. If I could I would read it oer and over again.
4,Mr. Popper and his penguins,"Mr. Popper's Penguins is a book with a sad story. You never would know the story is sad by the first couple chapters, though. It starts out in Stillwater where Mr. Popper is sitting down in his easy chair reading one of Admiral Drake's adventures. After finishing, he writes to the Admiral a fan letter. In return Admiral Drakes sends him a penguin. Then these charecters are in for a wild ride."
3,IT'S FUN TO READ BUT ONLY ONCE.,THE BOOK IS ABOUT A MAN THAT ALWAYS DREAMD TO VIST ALASKA AND HE WRITES A LETTER AND GETS SOME PENGUINS AND THE LIVE IN HIS REFRIGERATOR AND IN HIS HOUSE. YOU WILL HAVE TO READ THE BOOK TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. THIS BOOK IS NOT BAD TO READ
3,The Penguins were Cute,"I thought the penguins were so cute. The story is okay. I think it wss better when Mr.Atwater was writing it. When Mrs. Atwater wrote it, I noticed the penguins stopped talking so much. I thought it seemed like Mrs.Atwater was sort of rushing at the end to finish the story. I don't think she took the time there...still the penguins were cute."
3,Mr. Poppers Penquins,I liked this book because it was discriptive and it had alot of details. It made every thing stand out really clearly. It made sence to me because it was pretty easy. IT was on like a 6th grade reading skill. Thats one of the reasons why I liked this book.I think the best part of this book part of the book was really cool. It was when Mr. Miguigin saved a penqiuns life from a glacier.Penquins were his favorite animals in the whole world. After he saved that penquins life he took it home with him and fed it and everything like that. And he didnt care about what anyone thought of him. Finally him and the penquin went driving one nice day out and the penquin decided he needed to go back home to where he belonged. The old man got really upset about it cause he loved the penquin alot and didnt really want that to happen to his buddy. BUt he had too.
3,Mikey's Review,This book is about a Man who is getting poor and gets a penguin. Than he starts getting a whole bunch of these little buggers. Than the man and his beasts put on some pretty grovy shows. As a result of their perfofmances they became very rich. I love the snot out of this book.
1,Not too good,"Unfortunately, when the books arrived, a couple were not in the best of shape. Mr. Poppers Penguins pages in the middle of the book started falling out. My granddaughter was a little upset. I told her I will get her another."
5,Loved this book,Great children's book and even for adults with an imagination. It;s not like the movie but a great book no wonder it won the newberry medal!
5,"Easy, fast-moving fun for kids (and parents)","I bought this book to share with my 7 year old son, after having it recommended for boys(he loved it). I ended up also reading it with my 9 year old daughter, who found it funny, touching and very entertaining. She wrote a book report on the book, inspiring her teacher and all 19 classmates to read it! Short chapters, good read-aloud or independent. Good for the imagination. It has inspired my daughter further in reading and in writing her own stories. Not for the modern animal-rights types, though."
5,I would highly recomend reading this book.,This book was awesome. This guy loves Antartica. And he writes a letter to a studier in Antartica. The studier in Antartica sendes him a penguin. To see what happpens next you will have to read the book. It was a great book!
4,Popper's Is Easy reading,"Mr. Popper's Penguins is an easy read for a twelve-year old boy, and I found it enjoyable. It wasn't necessarily suspenseful, but each chapter ended with a problem that needed to be solved. This book would be great to use for a book report. The characters in the story are well developed and can be compared and contrasted. It would also be a great read-aloud for little children because of the silliness in it."
5,"Mr. Popper's Penguins by Richard Atwater, Florence Atwater",My daughter had asked for this book and has read it more then once so it must be good.
3,Should be called Illustrator and Photpshop F/X and Design,Overall this is a good book but the title is misleading. It assumes that you are working with Photoshop and Illustrator. Most the examples given rely on the use of Photoshop at some point in the process. Some examples rely almost entirely on Photoshop. I currently do not own Photoshop so when I received this book I was rather dissappointed. It really did not help me learn much about Illustrator. I also bought the Illustrator 8 Bible and thought that it was a much better book.
3,Du Maurier Literary Biography,"Books written to specs never quite make it. Do not look for any deep insights into either the life or continued popularity of Daphne Du Maurier because it isn't there.Richard Kelly seems puzzled that the writings of this renowned English author should every have reached the ranks of their popularity with common folk.If your find the author fascinating then add this to you collection, but for insight into her body of work read the titles themselves and ignore the literary talents.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
1,Ouch!,"Unfortunately, this is not her greatest book. It is possibly her worst book, in fact. Aimless & formless, it lacks the weridness that excited us all about Autobiography of Red, and instead is just dull. It feel more like a long poem that someone convinced her to turn into a book. The epigraphs by Keates are pointless, many of them not even epigraphs but mere notations, and really seem like just filler. Check out Autobiography of Red to see this Canadian at her best!"
1,This Just In,"Yes, it's official: the buzz around Carson was just a fluke. This book is sloppy, self-serving, uninspired and a bore. Add to that the fact that she hasn't a clue what poetry is and you've got one of the worst poetry collections published in past few years."
1,"Come Back to Poetry, Ms Carson, Please!","My friend told me recently that after reading Men in the Off Hours she couldn't even stand having the book in her house. She gave it to me and I read it immediately because I couldn't immagine what would cause her, or anyone, to react so strongly and negatively to a book. I see now, I have to admit, where that distate comes from. The book is weak. It's sense of the line is nearly nonexistent, and the story seems to have been recycled from two previous books (there are references made to her own earlier work in Plainwater and Men in the Off Hours, which I find tacky and a little self-obsessed.) On the bright side, I still have faith in Anne Carson's work. She's written some great poems in the past, so I know there's talent there that can reemerge."
1,Drivel for the Masses,"Anne's Carson's last three books--and most especially this last one, Beauty of the Husband--are books of poetry for people who seem to hate poetry. The lines and forms employed are anti-poetic, the subject matters wholly engaging if you are a middle-aged-plus woman who has felt in some way at some time wronged by the world. And in this way the poetry is greatly popular. And in this way it is also garbage."
3,GIve this Genius a Break,"The book is not as bad as I've been hearing. It is certainly lighter than the previous books by Carson, but there is the same quit witted mind at work here that we all fell in love with in Autobiography of Red. I predict the reader will be pulled into this story despite any misgivings one may have about the subject. I give it 3 stars, but I do still recommend it."
5,Young and talented and completely overlooked,"This is an excellent pop/antipop masterpiece. Every song is catchy and hummable but they are also deep enough to avoid the repetitive sound so common with today's music. This cd is damn good..I can only imagine what he will become as his songwriting matures even more. My favorite song is ""In Other Words"" Not the loudest or catchiest but perfect in composition. I had the fortune of seeing Ben in concert 2 days ago and it was great. He related well to the audience and played his songs with vigor...not to mention a couple of great covers like ""Ice Ice Baby"" and ""Let me roll it"" by McCartney...my only wish is that he jammed more than he did. Still, I know we can expect great things to come from BK"
2,overrated,"Ben came to my hometown for a show and my friend wanted to go so I went along. I listened to the album before going, and had heard ""Wasted and Ready"" on mtv2. The first time I heard Wasted I thought it was pretty catchy but I couldn't get past the damn lyrics. There's a big difference between fun and effortless writing, and writing that's just plain stupid. After hearing the rest of the album I felt the same way about most of the songs. I think he'd be better of having someone else write his lyrics for him. He tries to sound deep at times but ends up sounding like an 8th grade creating writing student.As far as the live show, it was pretty poor. The opener, a somewhat local band, did a much better job grabbing the audience's attention, and everyone, minus a handful of people, was there to see Kweller. His backing musicians just stood there the whole time...it was like they hated him. Ben attempted talking to the audience a couple times but always acted too afraid to say anything."
3,"The indie-hipsters ""discover"" another lost jewel from '96","Ah, yes. Now that Weezer has severed ties with the ... sons of ... Kurt Cobain, the indie-emo-hipster brigades have had to canvas the globe seeking a talented but undersold & underestimated artist to adopt as their own. & claim sounds exactly like their music. Even though theirs sounds as though they went into a 4-track studio & shat on mics while Ben Kweller has departed from his (obvious) mid-90s Nirvana fetish & moved into deceptively sassy pop-rock a la Ben Folds. & that is good music. & makes up for touring with Dashboard Confessional. Though being on Dave Matthews --- definitely not emo --- vanity label helps in that regard as well."
5,will always be a fan,"ben kweller is fantastic. his album sha sha is incredible. all the songs of a unique indie rock feel and this album showcases his talents as a song writer. ""walk on me"" & ""fallen"" are the best on here. get this."
5,Weezer fans will love this CD,If you love Weezer (especially the blue album) you will definitely appreciate and adore Ben Kweller. I promise :-)
2,Mini gems inside averageness,"I am sure in many years to come Mr Kweller will look back to this album and say "" well it had a few good points but it was not the best I did""There are a few great tracks- the rest so so. Its either a shame someone didn't have the balls to point this out before he released it as when its good its great and he might just have an unbelievable album inside him. I honestly believe if he takes more time and gets better at picking the good tunes he will be a household name. until then its hit or miss on each track. There's no in between.Save your cash as you will buy ity and not play it again."
3,"A mediocore album, lots of potential","While many rave about Ben Kweller's Sha Sha, it really is not that solid of a cd. Most of the music seems derived from Weezer with even more of a pop element. The strongest song on the Album is undoubtably ""In Other Words."" ""In Other Words"" is an amazing song however the rest of the album is not written in the same style and honestly are not that pleasent to listen to. ""Harriot's Got a Song"" and ""Falling"" are also strong points on the album. While Ben Kweller has a lot of potential, this album just does not completely deliever. However Kweller is only 20, so he has alot of time to get into his musical element."
5,I just got this CD yesterday,"My friend ahd this CD a year ago and i remember always thinkin it was cool but i never acctually got it until yesterday and I'm already obsessed, it's just REALLY good, and he has a style that kind of reminds me of weezer and beck (so far i think i'm the only one who thinks that.) I remember when i first heard ""Commerce,TX"" i thought it was Rivers Cuomo(sry if i spelled that wrong) singing. But it's just a really good CD and i highly reccomend it. Even ont he slow parts its completely original, and Ben has the ability to make both heartfelt songs and songs to rock out to. He is the most amazing solo act i have encountered in a while."
5,Fresh,"Ben Kweller turns in what is one of the most refreshing discs to be heard lately. His sound, while not completely unique, seperates him from most of today's pop. His songs are both catchy, yet meaningful at the same time. He is constantly compared with many different bands, from the hipsters to Ben Folds. This cd, however, seperates him from the rest of the modern music scene and presents a musician who can make the transition from pop-loaced punk to love ballads within the span of a single disc."
5,B.K. knows how to RAWK,"Ben Kweller's Sha Sha is an album that truly stands out amongst a pack of pop-rock wannabes. With his truly beautiful melodies and [extreme]attidude, B.K. is an artist that NO ONE SHOULD MISS. Sha Sha is a complete album of top-notch songs, with Kweller moving easily from piano ballads to pop rock anthems. In addition to his almost instinctive songwriting skills, Ben Kweller really knows how to RAWK. Anyone who's ever seen him live knows that this short little boy with a moptop has more energy in his pint sized body than do most fullgrown men. When all is said and done, B.K. is an extreme talent with the ability to put a smile on anyone's face. :) Check out Sha Sha and i GUARANTEE you won't be disappointed."
1,Not about Indie revival nerd guy stuff...,"He doesn't really pack a punch with his music, he's sort of playing it safe. I mean, is there actually an underground Punk audience any longer? Who is this young gentleman trying to please? The music strikes me as guarded, as if Ben is leaving a lot to be desired for fear of saying the wrong thing...or maybe I'm just reading too much into this album. Wasted And Ready is just an awful tune, worthy of Weezer at their worst. Anyhow, hopefully he'll stop biting his influences on his next release..."
5,melodic genius,"Keep in mind Ben Kweller is only 20 years old when these songs were made, but you cannot tell from this album. My friend described him as a cross between Weezer and Ben Folds, since it's indie-pop/rock laced with piano. He has the amazing ability to create catchy melodies. I listen to a lot of music, and there are many many songs out there that just ""lacks"" something, sounding very empty. All of the songs on this album has some sort of spark on it. His lyrics often times are ... almost dorky to an extent but it matches his quirky personality. No, it doesn't have anything to do with how I hung out with him during the 3 times I saw him (at his shows). He's terrific. Trust me on this. Whether you're into pop or rock or punk, you'll sure enjoy his very catchy melodic songs. I especially enjoy ""Family Tree"", a very Beatles-esque song. Go see him LIVE too. ;) I was lucky enough to catch him twice during 3 of his acoustic solo shows here in California."
5,Wish it was still around,"I bought this toy for my 3 mo old daughter for Christmas 2007. She loved it. It was such a cute toy and really aided in her sleeping by herself as she got older. It was fun to peek in on her reaching her finger to make the toy play music or nature sounds. A couple of years later and her little brother came along and he also loved it. They had a hard time sharing, but it would go in his crib when he went to sleep and then when she went down a half hour later with her. Fast forward another couple of years and they both still love it. I tend my baby niece (8 mo) who also loves it. Came on the internet to see if I could find it for a Christmas present for her, but see it isn't available any more. So sad as my husband just commented to me it was probably the one baby item we purchased that we truly got more value out of it than we paid. It is a great toy."

4,This book is for beginners,"This book is a good tool for anyone looking into computer security at a home level use. Not intented for experts in the field, this book provides an excellent introduction to computer security, encryption, firewall, privacy and virus protection. This is a must read for anyone who doesn't have a good understanding of the internet."

3,Mediocre,"Very Very Very 80s sounding. While that normally isn't a bad thing for me, it just makes this album very boring and cheesey. I'm a Manzarek fan, but he still plays at his best in the Doors."
1,A Sham,"Carmina BuranaInstead of the Ray Manzarek Carmina Burana, which I requested, I received an unknown, traditional version. Spoke to customer service and was told that amazon only markets the product and does not have the original. They do, for a more expensive price. I think that, since this was their mistake and since they have it in stock,I should receive the product that I was supposed to."
2,Couldn't finish this one,"The writing did not grab, captivate or entice me to continue this story. I quit about the time little Timmy's friend Billy left the country...There may be a lot of action later on, but too much mundane detail drove me to skimming, then quitting instead of hanging in there for the Big Finish."
4,Absolute Zero Was Absolutely Not A Zero,"I'm surprised there are only a few reviews for this book? I grabbed Absolute Zero on the ""freebie day"" hoping to score a good book and was not disappointed. It had me hooked from the very beginning. What was surprising to me was this was written in the late 90's before the 9/11 attacks but was spot on with what we've lived in the past 15 years. I liked the ""domestic terrorist"" angle and the way it all came together. It would make for a thriller of a movie. It got 4 Stars for the reason most of my reviews get that, I save 5 Stars for when I get an ""OMGosh OMGosh book"". It also was just a tad bit intricate (meaning Tom Clancey-ish)for me. It's still cheap to purchase, go get it. I intend on ready Aldrich's new book."
5,None,"wow i love action thrillers, but i never anticipated getting my socks blown off. surely the author has written more than two books that are listed in kindle. bravo!"
2,"No support, limited options!","PROS: Price is good and Samsung is a reputable name. The printer works via USB and I've had no major issues with it.CONS: The print driver offers no options to make any adjustments such as the thermal settings of the print head. The receipts don't print blacks very dark and they look somewhat faded. I called the 800-number to support and was simply referred to the website for more info.OVERALL: It works, but given the choice, I would choose something else like an Epson. You get what you pay for."
1,Worthless,"A previous reviewer stated the caucasian version might have better hair - I can assure you it does not.We bought this for our daughter last Christmas. She played with it on Christmas day and that was it.The hair, as previously reviewed, becomes a knotted, tangled mess that cannot be combed or brushed.We had marginal success with the color-changing nails and makeup but over all it was a poorly made toy and not worth the money spent.I will be using AMAZON.COM reviews to help me with my Christmas shopping THIS year."
2,Not worth the money.,"I just bought the African American version of this for my daughter (age 4) for Christmas. I use to have a Barbie styling head as a child and I LOVED IT. This is really not worth the money. The hair is extremely matted. When you try to comb it, the hair falls out. I'm really disappointed because I was looking forward to showing my daughter how to style hair. This was her first time having a doll with hair. As far as the other accessories, I don't know because I can't seem to get past the hair. The head has quite of bit of hair that seems to be everywhere. I'm still finding it's hair around my daughters room.When I first started to comb the hear I was thinking I couldn't comb through it because they didn't use the best hair because of the styling head not being the caucasian version. I'm just going to give them the benefit of the doubt until I read comments from those who have the caucasian head. Please comment so I'll know if anyone else feels the same way."
1,DO NOT BUY -huge disappoinment :(,"I reluctantly gave this product one star as there was no option for zero stars. My daughter was so disappointed when we opened it, as the hair absolutely cannot be brushed. I plan on contacting Mattel to complain about this."
1,Worthless!!!!,I bought this for my daughter last Christmas and like the other reviewers was completely disappointed from the moment we opened the box. We have never been able to comb the tangled mess of hair. I kick myself constantly for not returning it immediately. What a waste of money.
4,Sturdy grater,"This product took a while coming, but it is completely satisfactory. Heavier than most drum graters, it offers the possibility of a longer life."
2,Not satisfied...,I would not recommend. We have use only a few times and the drum that grades the cheese has a big dent in it. Heavy and ackward to use.
2,Poor at best,"This book is no more than an apology to the German people for putting a country at war, then losing it, then setting the seeds to build a new navy and start another war.If you enjoy war history, take a pass as 80% of the book is what's described above."
2,"When in trouble, break glass","First off, if you are going to write this genre, then recognize that there are people out there who know weapons, know the law and know unarmed combat. This books fails in all of those details.It is not that it is poorly written, but we have your basic corrupt republican administartion interested in buying bullets and expanding the ""evil"" military. They want to keep a terrible secret from getting loose.Then there is a cold blooded assassin, who starts out good, but makes dumb mistake after dumb mistake.There is the idealistic jornalist that starts running for her life around page 200.And the billionaire bad guys and biillionaire good guys. I'm sure this novel appealed to the New York publishing establishment's world view--does the word cliche mean anything?Finally, when we have a chance for an interesting ending, the author pulls a rabbit out of the hat to make everything better.This plot was terribly predictable."
2,Disappointing,"I read a lot of thrillers, and this debut by Casey Moreton disappointed me. As a previous reviewer pointed out, there is very little in this plot that is original or suspenseful. It is instead consists of elements recycled from a lot of previous thrillers -- a corrupt President, a reformed hit-man, a father looking for his lost daughter, etc.The most problematic aspect of this book is the lack of a central character. The author keeps jumping around from person to person, changing narrative perspectives. I therefore had no idea who the ""hero"" of this novel was supposed to be. To me, it's hard to write a good suspense novel unless you have a sympathetic central character, and there really isn't one in this novel.If you like suspense novels, I recommend reading Harlan Coben or CJ Box instead."
4,Reminds me of Ludlum at his earliest and best.,This is a book to spend the night with. You won't want to put it down.
2,"You-Tube, anyone?","I haven't read this book, and won't - jeez, this is the 21st century - just post the incriminating stuff on YouTube and nobody gets kidnapped or hunted down. C'mon, people! 2 stars for not understanding social media and the web! :-P"
4,except 4,"some absolutely wonderful songs which were virgins to me. Only the fire escape song drags down this collection for me. Of course I make a copy without that track so I can enjoy uninterrupted. Then it might get 6 stars. It is difficult to pick a favorite song, but the best lyrical line for me is ""small victories and minor miracles"". The recording is a major victory for wonderful music and great performance. And for the guys out there, the interior photo is my favorite part of the CD, even if it is slightly politically inccorrect (you'll have to buy it to find out what I mean)."
4,Bright Lamp Serves Its Purpose,"We purchased this lamp to use as a work light for doing crafts, reading, etc. Its main virtues are that it has halogen bulbs that can be oriented and the brightness can be adjusted. The lamp is very elegant and made of good materials. It came in a large box but needed to be assembled. We never could find the instructions but eventually figured out how to assemble it. The one problem was that where the top part fit into the main stand we should have placed a large screw; however, the hole was misshaped so we could not insert the screw. This does not affect the function of the lamp as long as you are not in the habit of carrying it around by the top. If you do the bottom might fall off. Overall, this lamp seems to be a good value. Especially when compared to the really junky lamps out there."
5,Greg Does the Milky Way,"Veteran folkbard Greg Brown knows the dark and muddy places of the heart. On his latest Redhouse Recording, he sings of love found, lost, and better left alone. With ethereal vocal backup from Karen Savoca, and the sometimes structured, sometimes writhing backup from axe-ter Pete Heitzman, Greg's smoky voice alternately comforts, confronts, and condemns.The recording visits dark blues (""The Moon is Nearly Full""), primitive country (a lilting ""Lull it Bye"", featuring just Greg and his banjo), even 60's Hammond Organ funk (""Steady Love""). In ""Smell of Coffee"", Greg paints a vivid minimalist picture, with just a few sharply defined strokes. In ""Telling Stories"", Greg does what Greg does best: conjures up a time, place and feel so real we can all drop by for a rest. For that, we thank him."
1,"what happened to your music, greg?","there is one redeeming tune on greg's newest album, ""milk of the moon"" that reflects greg's creative genus and that's the first cut. the rest of the tunes are not up to greg's standard of excellence. i may return it to red house records and wait for something better from greg. i love his albums, slant 6 mind, dream cafe, covenant, over and under.i am not a muxic critic, but i have listened to plenty of tunes and this album does nothing for me; except the first cut."
1,Bitter!,"I love cooking with major grey chutney and a hint of ginger, but this brand has way too much ginger. The ginger makes it very bitter and overpowering."
4,An interesting turn of events in this Penny Vincenzi Novel,"Penny Vincenzi is a favorite of mine and has been since I first discovered her. I bought the Litton family trilogy and have been hooked ever since. The novels usually take place in England and at various times in history making the books even more interesting as you get a glimpse in to the period.Love, desire, anger and betrayal, it's all there, along with some discoveries that tear a family apart and bring unlikely candidates together. A good read and a good price from Amazon, which is where I bought it. Definitely one to try."
2,Too much rambling!,I usually love all of Penny's characters and intricate plots. But this is the only one I felt was forever to get through. A lot of repetitious chapters......seemed to drag. But I'll be snatching up her next anyway. Still a fan!
5,Windfall is Wonderful,This was a lovely book and I am so glad I picked it up. This was the frist Penny Vincenzi book I read and now I intend to read more.
1,Windfall,It was very helpful to find out that this is a book that was first published in 1997.I think it is very misleading for a publisher to change the title and let readersthink this is a new book!
1,Penny Vincenzo needs to stop deceiving readers,"As a life long fan of hers I am dismayed that she is releasing titles under different names to sell more booksThis is unethical and baffling to me -- Windfall is a good example as is her last book released under two different names about six months apartPenny -- STOP doing this -- you do yourself a huge disservice and at some point your fans will just stop readingAmazon -- it is unethical that you do not note this -- please add ""released under another name and the date of release""We readers deserve better"
5,What a great writer!,"Once again, Penny has proved herself to be a great writer. I so enjoyed reading about Cassia and her windfall. Just that touch of mystery too! Very good."
1,worth product i never got from Amazon website before,"i ordered this book on june 14, i didn't get the item till amonth later. The shipping suck. finally, i got the book after my school already start, it was too late for my class. It's totally bad quality differ from what the seller detail. Bad Service, bad product. never buy anything from the seller again."
5,Kidnap the Santy Claws,Simply the best animated movie ever... A must have and a must see. It is incredible on DVD. It was like the first time I saw it in the movie theater...
5,What high-def is all about,Superb. Unbelievable. Watch this Blu-ray version to see things you never even knew were in the move. Every little shadow and shimmer of light. Truly glorious.
4,Great Halloween / Christmas movie!,"Wonderful movie by Tim Burton. May be a little scary or hard to follow for kids under 4, but they may like the music. My 3 year old daughter had lots of questions and hid under her blanket a few times, but she sung the ""This is Halloween"" song for weeks. Definitely needs to be in your Movie Library."
4,wonderful movie,"This movie was as entertaining for me as it was for my kids. The music was fresh, the storyline new and memorable. We will watch this movie frequently."
5,great movie,"Classic Tim Burton, and if you love his movies, this is a ""must have"". This is my favorite of his films thus far."
5,Huge Jack Skellington fan!!,I'm a huge Jack Skelington fan as well as a fan of Tim Burton. Loved this since it was released and added it to my collection. Sadly Disney discontinued their service where the digital copy was stored so that is of no use to me now but the Blu-ray is my favorite!
5,Amazing,"This is a must-have for my video library. Excellent story and visually stunning. Great emotional attachment to the characters, good guys and bad guys."
4,A good Disney halloween film!,"We love Jack Skellington and all things Disney in our family. Not one of Disney's best films, but still very good!"
5,Phenominal Movie,I got this for my wife whose favorite director is Tim Burton. I had to wait to get these on Blu Ray though and she waited patiently. She loves the movie and with it being on Blu Ray finally made it even better. She watches it on our PS3 system every so often and won't move till it is over. I highly recommend this and love the movie myself.
5,Probably one of the greatest animated movies,"There are many animated films out there. Snow White, Little Mermaid, An American Tail, Shrek, just to name a few. But there is one animated film that will be in my heart forever: Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas.The lovely film, directed by Henry Selick, tells the story of Jack Skellington the Pumpkin King. He has gotten bored with scaring people and wants to try something new in his life. That's where he discovers Christmas Town. He decides to let Santa ""take it easy"" and take over Christmas. But...I'm not going to tell you the rest in case there are some people who have never seen it before.It's a maginificent film and it would be enjoyed by all."
5,Great,The DVD I recived was in excellent condition and I am happy with the product I purchased. The only problem wa long it took for me to get the product. Other then that I got what I wanted. :)
4,Another Treasure From Tim Burton's Imagination.,"This film was excellent, it tells the story of a skeleton searching for the answer to his ""I want"" voice. This reminds me of some of the themes in Saul Bellow's book, ""Henderson the Rain King."" The animation is beautiful in one of it's most tedious art forms-- stop-motion."
5,Beautiful and Entertaining,"I remember when I saw The Nightmare Before Christmas in the theaters. I came out filled with joy and happier than ever! The stop-motion animation is remarkible. The characters and worlds by Tim Burton are enchanting. To put it short: This film is one of the best I've ever seen. It's fun, has amazine visuals, a clever story, and great music and songs. It's was a shame it got rated PG, for some reason parents wouldn't take their children to it. The only reason it was rated PG is because it may be too scary for kids under 5. All the parents who kept their kids from this musical, get it now!"
5,Great movie,This is a awesome movie since it first came out now in 3d DVD digital combo is great I watch alot of movies on my iPad so the digital copy is one of the main reasons for getting it and the kidos love it to
4,Tim Burton is AMAZING,This is one of my all-time favorites. I know the movie word-for-word. I don't own this particular movie set but I have the other DVD set (which also comes with 3 discs). I plan on buying this one for Decoration purposes as well as getting my original VHS of the movie back from my mother (she kept it after she bought me the DVD). I am a devoted collector of ALL Tim Burton items. I absolutely love him and his creativity.
5,The Best,"This is the best movie done by Tim Burton, definitely a classic. It was one of my favorites when I was just a kid and I still love it now."
5,The Nightmare on Blu-ray,This is well worth the buy - its HD quality is absolutely amazing throughout most of the movie...You can see a hair on the model of Jack's skull when he's approaching the door to Christmas Town - now that's clarity! It is likely that you will never see this movie in a better presentation..That is until something better than Blu-ray comes out. Every quality of the movie is pushed to the edge with Blu-ray..It is simply fantastic!
1,MISSING DVD,"I purchased this item for my daughter for Christmas. She saved the DVD to watch on Halloween. She opened the package to find that the actual DVD was missing,and only contained the digital copy. She is very upset as am I. This has never happened before,as I have ordered from here quite a bit. Now the return has expired. Will; have to rethink about ordering from here again!!!! NOT HAPPY!!!!"
3,"Better On Video, But The Music Is Still Bad","This film looks far better on video than it did in the theater. The overall look of the film is splendid, and the script is terrific. In fact, the only thing that is missing is a musical score of any quality. Elfman's songs for this film are an absolute failure. Completely unmemorable, boring, and finally a drag on the film. I would watch this film far more often if the music was any good."
2,Eh.,"Not the best. Yeah, it's edgy and stuff, whatever. I really don't care if it's edgy or not. It's kind of insipid. The animation and direction are fantastic, and Danny Elfman has ALWAYS done a wonderful job when it comes to scores/soundtracks, but the movie itself is pretty bad. The plot is silly. The whole ""be yourself"" message is older than dirt. The little ""creepy twist"" put on said message is, again, silly. I honestly do not know why it has such a following. If anyone would like to tell me, I don't think my email's hidden. If it is, send any messages (literate ones, mind) about why this movie is so great to Nessarose.of.the.East@gmail.com"
2,not for kids!!!,"you've GOT to be kidding putting this in the 3-6 yr old catagory! my husband and i watched this and called it the ""feel bad movie of the year."" of course, the animation and scores are very well done, but the adult themes make this a REAL nightmare-inducer for any child that is allowed to watch it."
3,good but...,"you know, when i saw it at the theatres eight years ago, i liked this film but when i last saw it earlier this year, i wasn't impressed."
1,Very Disappointed,I never opened the DVDs because the Jack Skellington bust was broken and I had to send everything back. I reordered and the second bust was also broken and instead of Amazon looking at their stock and finding one not broken Amazon just refunded my money - end of story.Not satisfied at all.
2,It's as though Disney bought Svankmeyer's soul...,"...and forced him to make this pseudo edgy, pseudo stop motion film. It's all very slick, but boring and a little offensive. The characters don't interest me. The story doesn't intrique me. The energetic musical style that pervades the whole thing is irritating. It's like they're contstantly trying to reassure the kids that nothing really bad is going to happen with musical cues and just the whole style. I find my attention wandering."
1,I'm such a dummy,"I didn't pay close enough attention to the Region thing. It DOESN'T play on my DVD player. Even though it was clearly stated. I feel like such a ding-a-ling.So, don't make the same mistake I did. :(.. but the movie is one of my faves! I just have to buy a copy that will work for me! :\"
3,The Nightmare Before Christmas...,Burton doesn't falter in his imaginative screen magic. This movies is artistically presented for you pleasure. The purchase is well worth it.
5,My kids love it,This movie is a classic. My young daughters love the story and the characters. They also really enjoy experiencing the theme around Halloween at Disneyland. Might be just a bit scary for really small kids.
4,Yearly Holiday Entertainment,"I generally don't like to watch the same movie again and again, so I don't have much of a video collection. The exception is for holiday movies. I consider this to be one of the classics we have to have on hand at the holidays. It's just so different from the others. Just in case you haven't seen it, it is animated, of course. It's whimsical and uplifting -- not just for the kids!"
5,Nightmare Before Christmas,"'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is one of those wonderfully atmospheric films that has easily stood the test of time. It is as delightful and quirky now as when it was initially released. The stop-motion animation is superb and the dark Tim Burton Characters are perfect for the story. Danny Elfman provided the music and songs for this film and they stick in your head at first listen and you can't help but grin and sing along with subsequent viewings. The story is unique and fun and although it has a very dark turn to it, it is still fine viewing for children, although I tend to feel adults may appreciate it more. This is one film I watch annually (yes, at Christmas time!) as a matter of tradition now and I love it every time. A modern classic, and rightly so, and if you haven't seen this film you're missing out on a rare treat. Snap it up quick and enter it's weird and wonderful world.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
1,horrible customer service. horrible,"bluesmurfs never answers emails. i have emailed for 4 weeks. needed to cancel, leaving country. asked for a refund, they were taking TOO long and i had to cancel. they refused to answer my emails, refused to cancel order, refuse to delivery refused to refund. they are horrible. horrible horrible horrible. never recommend them. never."
2,"Die Tim Burtons, die","I agree with the viewer of New York, the movie's problem is, that it's to violent (I don't mean like they use guns or has nudity), I'm trying to say is that poeple saw the movie because they though it was a kick ass movie, (that was shown on the preview)but then the theater showed the movie and I took my 4 year old brother(now 10) to see the movie that the new york times called ""A Tim Burton's Masterpiece"" turn out to be a kind of sick movie for young kids, after the movie my brother never wanted to see this bloody movie again, so guys, if you want to see a really cool musical just watch Grease instead."
1,I have not received my order,Its been more than a month since I ordered this movie but have not received it yet. I have sent an e-mail to amazon.com but I have not heard from them. I would like to know how much longer is going to take for me to receive my order. What happened to it?????
2,A holiday movie gone wrong!!!,"Loser(...)This one is definitely rotten to the core. You don't mix Holloween with Christmas! It is simply not done. Although, the songs were fun and creative. And, Danny Elfman has a nice, strong, deep voice."
2,No,"This movie. My responce; huh? This may be the most creepy thing ever. I watched it, and I didn't really feel like I had just watched a movie. It felt like I had just been stupified in front of a whole lot of people. Was I supposed to get that? I was thinking about watching it with my daughter, but I'm glad I decided not to. She is still a young girl of and ACADEMIC (hint, hint) mind set. I will always be happy to watch a movie with her, but not one that is this stupid."
1,"DEFECTIVE DON,T EVER BUY THIS DVD .BUY THE''VIDEO''","I BOUGHT 2 COPIES FROM TWO DIFERENT STORES IN WINDSOR ONTARIO CANADA.THEY WERE BOTH DEFECTIVE .THE FIRST IS THE MAYORS SPEECH IN THE CHAPTER JACKS OBESSION . THE DEFECT AUDIO .THE THREE OTHER DEFECT,S ARE 1 OGGIE BOOGIES SPEECH & 2SALLY SCREAMING 3&SANTA TALKING."
1,do not buy this dvd,boot leg copy.... even the dvd cover is very poor. buyer beware not worth the money and effort. spend extra to get the real thing. i wish i would have.
1,Not for kids,This show was weird and disturbing. It is not for kids. We thought it would be a fun movie to watch at Halloween time but instead we were left wondering why we wasted our time on it. Awful.
2,A waste of time,I thought this was a Halloween animation project. It's really a Christmas musical. It doesn't really fit either holiday. Not Tim Burton's work in my mind.
3,hard,This game is pretty hard for a video game. Truthfully Im not a big game and this was a x mas gift
4,Good Story; Mesmorizing Detail and Special Effects/Graphics,"The Nightmare Before Christmas is original in every sense of the word. The story line--Halloween creatures taking over the holiday of Christmas--has, from what I know, never been carried out before. Jack Skellington is the lead character who attempts to take over Christmas. The irony of this story is that the lead villian turns out to also be a hero. That, again, is a display of sheer brilliance and creativity. And it is true -- almost everyone in our modern era loathes musicals. I do too. But there is something quite masterful and creative about the way it is presented in this film.Although the movie is 10 years old, it will likely be quite timeless. There is nothing about the story that indicates the time period. The graphics are still of very high quality -- to the point that it is somewhat like ""eye candy."" I was mesmorized by the graphics. Yes, me--an adult.-- Michael Gordon"
5,A classic movie if there ever was one,"This is one of the top movies in my all time favorites list and for good reason. It came out two years before I even reached age 10 but I remember seeing and it being fascinated in a chilled sense. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a humorous (and somewhat dark) take on the classic Christmas tale--eventually becoming a classic itself. The first movie to be made in stop motion features memorable characters, brilliant music and great talent. Parents concerned if The Nightmare Before Christmas is too dark for some of their children should put those feelings to rest; it's a movie and an entertaining one at that. Like most adventure-influenced children's movies this has its good characters and scary ones. But it's still fun and shouldn't freak one's kids out at all. Overall The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of those films that is both fun and brilliant. It's classic!"
3,The Nightmare Before Christmas,The movie itself was good but the code for the digital download (the reason I bought it in the first place) had expired already. I didn't think it would have an expiration date...what's the point of that?
4,"Simple, but fun.","This movie is a great classic for the gothic community. It's dark, funny, and doesn't take too much brain power to appreciate it. Being a Disney movie, of course it has a simple love story hidden within the chaos, but it isn't as sappy as the usual love story goes. It's actually quite refreshing.Overall The Nightmare Before Christmas is simply fun. It shows how one should appreciate the small things in life and how you should always be yourself."
2,Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas,This video was sent as a VHS not as a DVD as expected. We feel it will be out dated and unable to be viewed in a short period.
3,boring animation,The Nightmare Before Christmas (Three-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray... I found this animated movie to be 'boring' 3D effects were good - should move-it-on
5,Great!,Great movie in many ways. Watched this movie over and over again with my daughter. She really loved it so did I.
5,Love this movie,"This is a great Movie, I love the twist in views from other holidays. This is one of my favorite movies. My Children ages, 14, 11,6 & 2 all love this movies as well. we have watched at least 10 time since buying it. An absolute must have!!!"
5,A film buff's must see,"Forget the kids. Sit back and enjoy this film for yourself. Although it's never lacking in entertainment or originality, it does owe a lot to the silent German expressionist films (especially ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari""). That being said I can only applaud Burton and his crew for daring to be different in this world of cookie cutter animation. If you look at the other reviews you'll find that they managed to offend a few of the viewers. Well I find that's usually true of a great film, and this is in every respect a great film."
5,This Is A Must Have - Not Just a Christmas Movie,This is definately a required movie. The issues addressed run from personal acceptance to social interaction and interpersonal relationships. A truly brilliant story with a very moving message. And it looks cool too!
5,Amazing effects for Adults too!,"This movie is amazing because of the special effects and the excellent music provided by Danny Elfman (Batman, The Simpsons). Everytime these guys are involved with a movie, you know it's going to be good with the exception of Pee-Wee Herman! Anyway, this movie on DVD is soo much better than the VHS version. I own them both, and what a difference it makes in visual and sound. The characters are so original, and the plot is the way everyone would want it to be."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!! :)! This movie is my all time favorite movie, GO TIM BURTIN!!!!!!"
5,Great DVD,"Danny Elfman and Tim Burton are genius. This movie is probably my favorite all time movie, the special edition dvd is loaded with tons of extra features. it has a some behind the stop motion animation type of things and also has 2 of Burton's earlier works: Vincent and Frankenweenie. Of coarse the movie itself is great also... no need to say that."
5,Refreshing..,"Halloween is one of my favorite holidays of the year so when I hear that there was a movie out that shows ""Jack"" the mayor of Haloween town taking over Christmastown from Santa a ran out and found the movie!And I loved every minute of it.. Tim Burton has a very unique way of picturing movies.. he can combine the most horrific pictures and themes into the most pleasant film that you have ever watched.. And he carries on the traditional throughout this movie.And the music is excellent (as it should be being from Elfman)..I however do not recommend the movie for the under 10 crowd."
1,nightmare before christmas,"Let me start by saying it took over 5 weeks to deliver, upon delivery my Granddaughter was extremly overjoyed. Until i tried to play the dvd, come to find out the movie will not play in the U.S.A. Not only is my Granddaughter upset i am realy pissed, This purchase was a waste of money and time."
1,Coraline it isn't...terrible 3d,"Ever since I had the pleasure of viewing the heavyweight champion of 3d movies..Coraline,i've been wanting to see Tim Burtons other 3d movie Nightmare b4 Xmas.Man was I disapointed!! Bleak boring musical,terrible 3d,graphics to dark,boring plot(what plot),etc,etc.No pop out 3d in this one.If 3d is your thing get Coraline and don't waste your money on this one."
1,disappointing!,"My family of four was looking forward to watching this movie having looked for a new to us family friendly Halloween themed movie. After 1 hour we all decided to change the channel. Not funny for the kids, 5,7 and 10, and not interesting enough to keep Mom and Dad's attention. Love Burton, but this was not good. We may not be quite EMO enough to get this movie...But we gave it a good try."
2,not a great version,"Too bad this version is not like the one shown on cable. Seems to be an earlier version, and not worth the money. The sellers should be more open about what exactly they're selling when there are different versions. We're not all experts in all films."
3,It's Okay- Except For The Music,"The animation was great and the plot was pretty good, although it was too similiar to ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas."" However, this movie was boring at times and I couldn't wait for it to be over with. The major downfall of this movie was the music. It was as if one extremely long and boring song was being sung throughout. Even the Boogie Man had no boogie."
5,My Favorite Movie,"I discovered this movie when I was in third grade. I saw it once and one thing got stuck into my mind. The music! Danny Elfman does a wonderful job when it comes to creating and telling a story through songs. Though I don't own the movie, my best friend does, and when I had first moved here to my home, she made me watch it because I thought I didn't know the movie. But now, I woun't forget it no matter where I am. It's a must see, if not a must have!"
5,"Pop fairytale, cult clasic, and timeless masterpiece","If you are a fan of Danny Elfman, or Tim Burtin, you need to see this film. As a child, I looked forward to those now clasic animated christmas movies from the 50's and 60's, but I always thought they were a little too inocent. Nightmare Before Christmas is any childs fantasy brought to life, as well as an homage to those great films. Frame after frame, Burtin paints a wonderfully macabre landscape with characters who are spooky as they are lovable. Add the unforgettable music and songs of Danny Elfman, and you have a film that will never grow old. Do yourself a favor, add this one to your collection."
5,Nightmare Before Christmas - Blu-Ray Edition: Disney does it again,"This is without doubt the best looking and best sounding blu-ray DVD I have yet watched. The picture is nothing short of incredible. Such unbelievable clarity and depth, you would think the puppets are performing live for you in your own living room. I was slack-jawed at good it looked.After seeing this film on blu-ray, it instantly renders every other standard definition copy obsolete.Buy it now."
5,The Greatest Story Ever Told,"Tim Burton has always been my favorite director, and this film only makes me like him more. Burton blends an eloquent tale of treachery and blends it with drop dead gorgeous special effects. This DVD edition is my 2nd favorite DVD of all time ranking just behind The Rocky Horror Picture Show 25th Anniversary Collector's Edition. In short, this film is an excellent movie that has much to offer. I do not recommend this film for those who still believe in Sandy Claws."
5,Nighmare Before Christmas,"I just love this movie!! The DVD is very clear, I am looking forward to seeing it on Blu Ray!!!"
5,Another great classic for my collection,"This was pretty much what I expected. Great combo pack, great picture, lots of behind the scenes which I love. Only complaint, the case was chipped at the bottom."
4,Awesome movie,"I bought this BD for my sister. She loves the movie and all of the characters. The blu-ray looks even better then the DVD, the colors are more vibrant and the depth of the picture comes across in great detail in your HD TV"
5,Nightmare Special Edition Is Awesome,This new edition is sweet. Enhaced for great picture and sound so you can blast those wounderful songs to drown out your horrable singing voice as you sing along. And the special features and Burton's short movies are a must for the hard-core Burton fan... our any body. Tim Burton is a genius and i cant wait to see what he does next!
5,DVD Nightmare Before Christmas,"Got exactly what i ordered and on time, thank you so much, made my week..."
4,Awesome creation.,"Always loved this movie, but in Blue Ray, the sound is sharper and the image is clearer. This musical masterpiece is a classic."
4,Amazing DVD!,"... Tim Burton is now a favorite of mine. There is also a great making of and the deleted footages are so fun. Many more extra's also such as an art gallery with over 400 stills, and of course the commentary which I never bother to listen to on any DVD. Now the movie itself is brillaint. The animation is superb and the plot is just amazing. My only complaint being that at many points the film is lacking and just moves so slow, hence the missing star. Dont get me wrong, it is an enjoyable film and definitely one I watch over and over, but many scenes have some drab and boring music, that Im not sure of kids will enjoy. But the film is amazing and that is just one flaw. Its a must. This DVD is a MUST..."
5,What I wanted.,"It's what I wanted, the box is very nice for collectors and it came on time and in perfect shape."
5,Funny!,"I watched this movie with my sister while we were staying at my cousin's house over spring break. We both loved it! We quoted the dialouge and I bought it two days later. (Special Edition DVD!) Anyways, the story is about Jack Skellington, aka ""the Pumkin King"" who lives in Halloweentown with other Halloween characters. He accidentally finds a place called Christmastown and falls in love with it. Jack then proceeds to take over the holiday and making a big mess out of it. But don't worry, Santa sets it right in the end. My sister and I both love the Boogie Man song, it's so funny! If ya like odd movies this one's for you!"
3,"Classic movie, but...","I bought this because my fiancé had not yet seen this classic film. It was a spur of the moment purchase, but I was disappointed that I found it on Netflix later. Oh well!"
3,Expected More,Rented this because it was highly rated and I like Tim Burton. Expected to like it. Was let down. It wasn't as strong as it should have been.
3,DVD skips,"The movies itself is great, the quality of the DVD is not, it skips in some spots and was supposed to be brand new??"
4,Nightmare Before Christmas All Year Long!,"One of the better sound tracks avalible, it does not skimp on the music and includes everything in there. Danny Elfman really outdid himself with NBC, which is a joy to fans everywhere."
4,Fantastic Movie!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I can't exactly put my finger on what made this movie great, but believe me - it was!"
5,Another great movie.,"This one has been my favorite for a while now. I got it cheap from Amazon, as always, the best deals are on here. :3 Anyways, the movie was beautifully animated, the story once again great, and Tim Burton did it again... he made a great film. I took a chance the day people started to talk about this film, and well, now its a Halloween tradition to watch every year. To all others, I hope you have enjoyed watching this."
4,Spanish speakers beware,"It was an excellent value including bluray,dvd and 3d versions.however the 3d version lacks Spanish dialogue which is only included in the dvd version. The item description did not reflect this and I had purchased this for my dual language class."
4,"Incredible Film, So-so DVD","Don't get me wrong, NMBC is one of the greatest films of all time. It is beautifully shot, wonderfully dark, and Danny Elfman's beautiful singing voice makes Jack come alive. My one complaint is with the DVD transfer. While they have included great extras like ""vincent,"" and the picture quality is wonderful, there is a sound defect. The Mayor's line, ""Wait, we haven't given out the prizes yet,"" is MISSING. Wonderful film, Tim Burton is a genious, but the transfer leaves something to be desired."
4,The Nightmare Before Christmas,"At first I gave this DVD a 3 star rating, I think it deserves 4. It's a very entertaining movie but rather cheap packaging (DVD on demand). The packaging is not 3D like the version bought at Hasting, Best Buy, etc. The movie itself is good, I liked it and the quality is pure. The whole packaging thing really gets to me though. In the near future I will be buying the 2 disc version from either Hastings or Best Buy. The Film: 9/10 - Packaging: 2/10.* Bonus Features1. What's this? Jack's Haunted Mansion Holiday Tour2. Tim Burton's Original Poem (Narrated By Christopher Lee)3. Audio Commentary By Tim Burton, Director Henry Selick And Music Designer Danny Elfman4. Behind-The-Scenes Making Of ""Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas"""
3,NOT the version for American DVD players,"I was unaware this was not formatted for the USA, but after double checking after I received it, this WAS stated on their site, so it was my oversite. It arrived promptly and in excellent condition."
5,Highly Satisfied Customer,Very happy with the quality of merchandise. My daughter was delighted to recieve her Nightmare Before Christmas collector's movie DVD set. The DVDs were delivered on time and in excellent condition. Thanks to the seller who made us happy.
3,Strange movie,"Even for Tim Burton. We as a family were not really in the mood for a musical.If you're into off beat musicals you'll like it. As for us, we'll pass. Besides, on that particular night we were looking for a Halloween movie, and this turned out to be a Christmas movie. Guess we should have realized by the title."
4,A Film For All Goths & Emos!!!,"If you are a goth or emo kid, I'm sure you've seen this hundreds of times! But, I'm not here to bash goth kids, I'm here to review this film. It's a pretty good movie. I don't love it, but I like it. I do love the 'This is HALLOWEEN' song, and the revamped version done by Marilyn Manson. It's awesome that they combine HALLOWEEN and Christmas. In case you are new to the world of Tim Burton's depressing gothic/emo films, I'll give a brief synopsis; Jack Skellington is the King of HALLOWEEN Town, and he is getting tired of it. After the HALLOWEEN bash, he accidentally stumbles into Christmas Town and wants to bring it all back to his world. The creatures of HALLOWEEN Town begin to help Jack with his dream. Will Jack's dream go the way he plans? Can he save Santa Claus from Oogie Boogie. If you are a goth/emo kid, love HALLOWEEN, and Christmas, you'll love THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS!!!"
5,A MUST HAVE!!!,"This is my first Blu-Ray purchase and I couldn't be more pleased. This is one of my favorite films, even though I only had it on Laser Disc before this. Will watch this many more times!"
2,Very dissapointing after Corpse Bride.,"Update on this movie. Because of the negative comments posted to my original review, I decided to watch the movie again, on Showtime, in HD-Big screen. I thought that maybe I missed something. My opinion has not changed. I think it's an absolutely terrible movie, and I was a little too generous giving it a second star. By the way, in this class of movie, I like Coraline the best.Original review: I watched this via streaming. The detail was outstanding. The problem was that as much as I liked Corpse Bride, I disliked this movie. In Corpse Bride, the characters seemed genuine, and I really sympathized with the two brides. Loved the dog. In Nightmare, all the characters were shallow, not developed, and not lovable at all. Even the dog failed to give me any emotion. Totally bored throughout. Waited for it to get better, and it never did. Corpse Bride gave us a detestable evil character, and a surprise ending, Nightmare gave us neither."
5,NEW NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS BETTER THAN THE 1ST!,I absolutely LOVED this Nightmare Before Christmas Collector's Edition! I purchased it for my niece who is a big fan of the original and enjoyed watching it with her. I would definitely buy it again and we will watch it for years to come for sure :)
5,Awesome,This movie is amazing on Blu Ray. I was very impressed with both the quality of the sound and picture. Definitely worth the buy.
1,Definitely not one of the best.,"I really enjoy animated movies, but this one just didn't work it's way into my heart. The songs are stupid and uncaring. The scenes are sometimes terrible and uncalled for. I did not like this movie at all. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't buy this video."
1,Simply awful...,"This movie is dark and depressing. It has forever ruined Christmas for me. Christmas is supposed to be about love and peace, not torture and death! Totally disturbing! The only positive thing you can say about it is the level of creativity is high but what a terrible direction to take with it. Do yourself a favor and pick some other show. If you value your sanity you will steer clear of this film at all costs."
1,yuck,"Why does ""everyone"" love this movie? It's not that good. Not at all. I saw this when I was four and I absolutely hated it when I found out they kidnapped Santa Clause. The zombie girl taking her head off at one point in the movies was pretty gross too...yuck. I don't reccomend this film."
1,not good at all,"this movie is not worth being called a cult fav, i have no idea why it ever became so popular... and p.s. i actually do like james and the giant peach, just not the nightmare before christmas its soooo bad i will never watch it again."
5,One of my favorite films.,"I have long appreciated stop-motion animation. Since childhood, Christmastime was the best time of year. Not because of the gifts and festivities, but because that is the only time when network television would air the Rankin/Bass Christmas specials. Tim Burton's work on ""Nightmare"" brought back the giddiness I felt as a child. The direction is flawless, but if not for Danny Elfman's composing, I am not sure this would be the same film. My 2 year old son loves this film, and can sing bits of ""What's This"", as it is his favorite song. I recommend this film to everyone, from 2 to 92. My son had no problems with this film, although I do know some older children who were less than impressed."
1,Really upset,"Apparently, ""this disc cannot be played in your region"". I can't believe Amazon allows stuff like this to happen. Yes, I noticed the SMALL red warning, not nearly noticeable enough. I am really upset that after waiting and specifically choosing a seller one state away from me to get it sooner, this DVD won't play. Why would a DVD seller from the states make DVDs formatted for South Africa? Amazon should look into a better way of warning it's buyers before purchase of regions. I wasn't aware that they even existed. Now I have an open DVD that the seller probably won't even take back because the seal has been broken. I always shop through Amazon, but am seriously doubting them after this inconvenience."
3,Two Things that Shouldn't Be Merged,"I went to go see ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" during its re-release to theaters a few years ago. I thought it was an ""all right"" movie, albeit somewhat boring. A skeleton learns about Christmas for the first time and tries to write himself into the traditions of the holiday by taking Santa Claus's place and having him kidnapped. Personally I think that Christmas and Halloween are two holidays that never should be merged together. If this happens, Halloween robs Christmas of its magic and glory and replaces it with fear and monsters. I do not like Christmas specials of this genre, and I also dislike ones that take modern spins on timeless customs. It just robs the holiday of its whimsy."
1,Very disappointted!!!,Come to find out this movie does not play in the USA!!!! I will never by a movie off of Amazon ever again!
1,Horrible release,"Disney should be ashamed of releasing this film in such a manner. The master they used is outdated and not even anamorphic. The master, and all bonus materials were originally produced for a $100 Laserdisc release done over 8 years ago! The same is true for other Disney films like SISTER ACT, ARACHNOPHOBIA, THE BLACK CAULDRON, THE JOY LUCK CLUBOther studios remaster often, expecially when doing a release in a new format. With these kind of choices being made by Disney I wonder what they are going to pull with Blu?"
4,Great movie,This movie is one of the best there is. It is early Tim Burton and people of every age can relate to all the characters.
5,Very good :),"Great movie! Received it in amazing time, only complaint is that one of the prongs that holds the dvd was broken so the disc doesn't stay in place.Other than that the quality was perfect"
4,Nightmare delivery!,"This order was lost in the mail & I sent an email stating I had yet to receive the DVD that was ordered to be received in time for my daughter to enjoy will recouperating from surgery....Amazon promptly resent the DVD next day air, while it wasn't the surprise I hoped it was still nice to have that kind of service to replace a missing order."
5,Nightmare Before Chrismas,I was very happy with the delivery of this. The price was great. It was delivered in a timely manner and was in perfect condition. I would buy again...
5,Brilliance at Work,I was surprised when i opened this dvd and watched it 4 months after buying it.. super sulit DVD.. previous Tim Burton's Films Vincent and Frankenweenie are included.. brilliant!! and lots of extras.. nice menus and art features..DTS Sound is also superb... a real collector's item and an upgrade from the previous release..
5,Love this movie!,"Wonderful movie, classic story and memorable music. Looks great on Blu-Ray! Stunning picture and great audio. A must own in any movie collection."
2,The code for the digital copy was missing!,I purchased this 2 disc collection for the digital copy and the paper with the code wasn't even in there! The kids love this movie but it was a waste of money to pay that much if you don't even get the code! This was listed as new. I don't think so.
5,Fantastic Nightmare before Christmas,"I already have this on VHS and DVD, but now have a Blu Ray so purchased this for that reason. I love this movie. Love it Love it Love it. My son just purchased a 3D version for his 3D Television and I will get to watch it on his TV in the future.So if you love Jack Skellington, the Blu Ray is awesome."
5,great,Loved the movie. Great family fun. The songs are very addicting. This movie makes my children smile like crazy. Fun all year round.
5,It's a great movie,"I love the blu ray version of the nightmare before Christmas, it was an amazing movie from the beginning to the end. And it's come with two DVDs one blu-ray and the other one regular."
5,THIS IS HALLOWEEN!,This is a must have for any movie collection! They dont make movies like this anymore! Tim Burton at his best! Got this at a great price here on amazon compared to Target and Wal Mart.
4,For those who want good solid information,"If you are looking for a good overview of Ecuador without all of the tourist related fluff, this is the book for you. It briefly covers topics from Ecuador's early history right up to present day politics, people and enviroment."
5,Beautiful!!,"Easy to pop open and install the inner-frame. It looks gorgeous in my room, would probably be helpful if it included a small hook to screw into the ceiling, but it didn't matter. I'll be buying the rest of these.This does NOT come with a light, which is fine by me."
4,Springfield 90113-1,I like this item and I had purchased five because I wanted one in each room to check the temperature and humidity. They all seemed to work fine and I can see the readings at just a glance
1,Less than one star!,"Simply put, this device is inaccurate and can't be relied on at all whatsoever. If it was anywhere near worth the six buks, I'd say so. It's complete junk and they should pay YOU to use it! Just don't buy it. Unless you want to waste a few bucks..."
2,"Imprecision, rather","We got this thermometer for hatching chickens, and needed a really precise instrument, which this is not. It appears (compared to two other, quite reliable thermometers we have in the incubator) to run at least 3 degrees below actual temp. The hygrometer I can not speak for, as I am comparing to only one other, and, while they have a 10% disparity, I cannot say which is more accurate. A great price if only a very approximate read is needed."
2,Cheaply made,"Only lasted several weeks, not very accurate and hard to read.I replaced it with a digital humidity monitorFred T"
5,learning,"I had this book since I was little, and gave it to my kids. They messed it up I was so happy I could get another one form amazon"
3,A quick and somewhat satisfying read....,"w/ plenty of illustrations that outlines the life and genius behind some of Rodin's work. I wish, however, the author would of went into more detail on some aspects of his life...He doesn't spend much time on his childhood and goes very briefly over his relationship w/ Claudel. Overall, though, he does a good job portraying the personality of Auguste Rodin."
5,"A must for the young, A delight for the mature pianist","If you love the piano, this book is almost as important as a good edition of the Beethoven sonatas and the Well-Tempered Clavier. A student of Leopold Godowsky and the teacher of Richter and Gilels, Mr. Neuhaus put together a very inspiring, almost revelatory book on the loftier spiritual and intellectual aspects of playing the piano. I recommend it wholeheartedly."
4,Easy to reference certain subjects quickly,"I like this book although it is very similar to Baby 411...you do not need both. I like how you can easily go to a particular question or subject without reading the entire book. The main thing I am getting frustrated with and this is for all baby books, just not this one (but this one included) is the push for breastfeeding. Maybe these books should be slightly less one sided and allow those that may not be choosing this route to feel the same as those choosing to breastfeed."
5,ok,This book is pretty much the same as what to expect the first year except this one kindof goes into a little more depth.
4,Your Baby's First Year for Dummies,"The book arrived in a couple of weeks, in good condition. It took longer that most AMAZON orders, probably because it came from across the Atlantic. The cardboard envelope the book was sent in was not closed at one end, and the book was sticking out. Luckily, it was not lost in the mail, and it did not get wet or otherwise damaged in transit.The book, itself, was as expected. My daughter is expecting her first child this summer, and had joked that a baby book ""for dummies"" might be helpful. I believe that she's enjoying it and has found it valuable.As long as I was aware of the distance the product had to travel, (I was careless with this purchase, and didn't notice this) I would buy from this vendor again. I trust that the failure to properly seal the packaging was an unusual problem."
2,didnt care for it,"again, not the best book out there - i believe the best baby books out there are 'what to expect when expecting' and other books that are writting by women with first hand expierence - if i knew this book was like this, i wouldnt have wasted my time or money"
2,Insensitive production,"The plays are mostly in verse, but the pages are laid out like prose. Most disappointing, making this e-book useful only for searching."
5,Helpful,"The professor of this course had us read this textbook in conjunction with another while also participating in group counseling.I found that our group very much mirrored the stages presented in the textbook and gave a vocabulary to what I was experiencing while in group. Corey and Corey have many insights that will improve your ability to understand and eventually (after a lot of practice) lead a group.I give the textbook a five out of five for its easy-to-understand layout, carefully constructed chapters, and most importantly, its ability to help me understand group counseling."
5,Great Book,The book was great and helped me understand the porcess but my professor was also great. Great professor and great book=knowledge!!!!!!!!!
2,cute story waste of money,"while the story is cute the quality of the acting, cinematography, costumes, and DVD are about as bad as it gets the only film I've seen thats worse is: by hook or by crook. The subtitles go by so fast even evelyn wood could not keep up with them. the sound is like a bad dubbing and the acting is unbelievably bad. It would be nice to see it remade with a good cast aand crew"
3,Ok Movie,Movie was kind of boring but with a good theme. The quality was great but the movie itself was not that great.
3,"good story, bad acting","I don't have this video but I remember watching this a few years ago, the story is cute but acting was so ridiculously bad that it was funny, specially the mom. she looked like was reading the lines right off a cue card. other than that it was a funny film bad acting and all."
1,Terrible product quality and service,"Ordered a 2 pack, only received a single pillow...which upon being filled the first time, found it leaked terribly. Best I could get was a 1/2 refund for the one that never arrived since the leaking pillow was ""used"". So much for consumer protection and refunds for defective products. Do not buy ANYTHING from this company, especially this product, unless you want to lose your money. You'd have better odds at Vegas getting your money back."
2,Not worth it,"In order to even get a little support from this pillow you have to fill it to the limit. It's incredibly heavy and leaks a little. I would not recommend this pillow at all, it's not any better than a regular pillow. I wish we never would've wasted our money."
1,DANGEROUS - MOLDS AROUND PLUG (2 of 2 pillows I bought). DO NOT BUY!,"This product is DANGEROUS.I used these for 9 months. I bought the pillow covers, and because I typically only wash the pillow case, I had no reason to remove the zippered pillow cover. I just decided to wash the cover, and upon pulling it off, saw black mold. The second pillow had the same black mold growing out from around the plug. This is hazardous to one's health. I mentioned to a few people that I have been sick more in the past 6 months than I have been in the prior 3 years. While I can't say ""It's the pillow!!"", there's a good chance that sleeping on mold-generating machine every night for an extended period may have contributed.DO NOT BUY THIS. I am going to send mine in for a refund."
4,good pillows,"I was hoping for a miracle cure for my neck. The pillows didn't perform any miracles, but, they are good pillows."
1,Least comfortable pillow in our house,"I purchased this pillow thinking it would be amazing based on all these 5-star reviews. Most overrated pillow ever! We currently own 4 different pillow types for our beds. This is the least comfortable. I toss and turn when sleeping on it. It is soft on top and hard on the bottom, which does not feel good. I now have one of these pillows sitting in the guest bedroom and the other in the basement. My two cents: you are better off playing the pillow lottery by picking up a pillow at your local store than this rip-off."
5,Best purchase ever!,"I was heading for surgery on my neck and the pain was intense. In the pre-op packet from the surgeon was a section on best beds and pillows for your back and neck. This product was on the top of the list. I purchased two, one for me and one for my husband who has had neck problems for years. From the first night, it was amazing! Even though I had a disc pressing on my spinal cord, I was able to lessen the pain and have the first nights sleep in months. After surgery, it has been awesome. It allows my neck to remain in a neutral position, and has really helped with the spasms in my shoulders and neck. My husband has had the same results. We also purchased the covers, and have had none of the issues that others have mentioned with the pillows being cold. We used about 40 oz of water and haven't needed to add any more. Totally worth the money paid!"
4,Good Pillows,"The pillows were delivered in a very timely manner. We followed the instructions for filling the pillows but had to remove some of the water to our comfort level.They have been working great the past two weeks we have had them. They are comfortable. I'm not real sure they are worth the price but they have been doing a good job for both my wife and I. We both had stiff necks the first two or three nights we had them. Since the water adjustment they have been good. I don't wake up with the headaches I used to wake up with. We both use CPAP machines and continue to struggle with the nose apparatus slipping when we turn over. But over all, I am mostly satisfied with the pillow purchase. Time will tell how well they hold up and how satisfied we are over a few months. But, for now we're happy."
5,Just what they wanted,I purchased the Mediflow Water Based Pillows (2-pack) as a Christmas gift for my sister and brother-in-law and they love them so much I am going to purchase some for myself. They say these are the best pillows they've ever had and find the ability to adjust the water pillow to their own preferences especially great. Ordering from HPMS via Amazon was easy and the shipment arrived right on schedule.
2,"Sorry, did not care for this product","While I could get the lift I needed by adding water, the water itself made the pillow feel cold. I tried wrapping it in a double layer of fleece and then my pillowcase but after one night my neck and shoulders hurt so bad from the cool water that I just gave up. Reminded me of the time my waterbed heater gave out. Even a heavy quilt on top didn't protect me from the coolness. I was definitely not happy with this product and would not recommend it."
4,still using it,"It's been over a year and I am still using it. I've had to add and remove water only two times the last year. A few times I thought maybe I wasn't getting good neck support and went back to a regular type pillow, but then realized that the Mediflow really works and no other pillow is comfortable anymore. I would recommend it."
3,"Solid , well worth discovering , though not as good as Leone","The partnership of Franco Nero and Sergio Corbucci is not quite up there with that of Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone , but it aspires to that . I expected something different but still worthwhile and the film did not disappoint me .The film is darker and stays true to the nature of Django's world . In a different film , we may have found out more about him , but that is not important to the story .The picture quality is mostly good , but some parts of the image are damaged and this is made clear upfront in a little message before the film begins .Any Western fan should enjoy this , but keep in mind it is coming from a different perspective ."
2,Good 1st 30 Minutes,"The first 30 minutes of the movie were of interest. The Americans with red hoods etc. Even with makeup Franco Nero looks a little young for the role. The movie has a great deal of plot holes and jumps some. The dub job was the worst I've seen in an Italian Western. I watched the movie in Italian with the subtitles, it was much more enjoyable. A good see once film but nothing to call great. I did think the ear cutting was original. The extra disc on DVD, ""The Last Pistolero"" was a slick little short."
4,Django lives,"I'd heard lots about this film over the years but was unable to see it until a few years ago. It has the usual flaws of a spaghetti western (poor dubbing, choppy editting and almost silly lyrics for the title song), which are to be expected,and after having seen so many, are even endearing, but its quirkiness more than makes up for it. (Any film with the main character constantly dragging a coffin behind him in the mud has a certain deviant appeal.) Excepting the Leone westerns (which are so far above the ordinary Italian western that they are literally in a class by themselves), this is one of the best."
3,OK but no cigar,"The cigar came with Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood. This film gets a nod as inspiring the spaghetti westerns that came later, but there's so much that was done poorly. I got the feeling that the director thought that if there enough bullets flying that nobody would notice."
2,Stylish But Vacant,"Just your run-of-the-mill spaghetti western also-ran, complete with a joltingly simple plot, one-dimensional characters and the worst dubbed dialog this side of Pulp Fiction's basic cable edit. Django himself, an opportunist without much in the way of personality, is only likable in direct comparison to the cookie-cutter roster of villainy he mercilessly cuts down at every opportunity. Even the scenery, which normally delivers a heaping portion of a western's aura and mystique, falls flat in Django. Here the wide-open promise of a broad, sweeping landscape is reduced to dreary patch of mud, a fistful of thin, trail-weary horses and four pathetic, lifeless wooden shacks. If a steady diet of ricocheting bullets, heavy drinking and utterly pointless double-crossery is what you're hungry for, by all means chow down - this is ninety solid minutes of just that with little variation. Those with an appetite for more filling material, on the other hand, should just keep on walking."
2,not what I expected,no really a good old western but then againClint Eastwood ruined it for everybody elsecheck it out I thought naw
4,Django,"AWESOME!! Yes, the sound track is bla and it is obviously a low budget movie - but inspite of that it is one of the best westerns I ever saw. The violence might have been hard in the 60's, but everybody who can cope watching the Sopranos will have no problems with this film. After we viewed this film, my husband's first comment was:"" When do you get another Django movie?"". Great entertainment!"
1,Yuck!,"a spaghetti western at its worst. Mistook the film for the new Django and what a mistake it was. Thankfully, it was only a rental. Never bothered beyond the first ten minutes."
3,Django Was Interesting To Watch,This was an excellent spaghetti western and fun to watch. The cinematography was great.The plot was just good enough to keep my interest through the whole movie.
5,Django è perfetto! Un classico!,"This is a magnificent example of the spaghetti western genre. Dark, moody and mystical, as are the better films of this type. The Leone/Eastwood films remain the standard, but DJANGO is one heck of a cool film. Sergio Corbucci's direction and Franco Nero's performance combine to make this a true Euro-Western classic. Blue Underground's presentation is beautifully done, and they have included the option of viewing the film with the original Italian soundtrack, which is definitely the way to go for this one. They have also included a nice little ""Uovo di Pasqua"" on the Special Features menu page (hint: Django's coffin). If you like the ""Dollars"" trilogy (The Sergio Leone Anthology (A Fistful Of Dollars / For A Few Dollars More / The Good, The Bad And The Ugly / Duck, You Sucker)) then DJANGO is a must-have!"
3,django,The movie is OK.A lot of violence.I sat through this because my husband wanted us to watch this.We actually thought we were getting the newer django.Next time I will review it.
2,I don't see what's the fuzz about,"Maybe when it was filmed was a hit, but now it's dated. The dialogues are ridiculous, it can be fun because it's so bad. It's dubbed in English, and very poorly. Whi not leaving the subtitles?"
3,Fist Full of Dollars it isn't,Spaghetti westerns have a command thread or too and this one had them all. The main characters efforts were either hurt by the editing or poor writing. I didn't run it off but left the rooms a few times without regret.
3,Django?,"After seeing the new Django in the theater, I thought I'd watch the original. Wow surprised. I liked it even thought the story line was different. Thank Amazon Prime."
2,Uninteresting,"Once again we have a stranger with a score to settle. Of course, he is lightning fast with guns and never misses. Before it's all over ( I couldn't bear to watch it all) he's wasted scores of Mexicans and Americans both. Why exactly I'm not sure. The story takes a back seat to all the cruel, unusual and gratuitous violence. I don't mind violent movies but I'd at least like to have an interesting story to go with them. I kept trying to like this show. After reading reviews what I imagined sure had the real thing beat. I mean c'mon, a guy who drags a coffin around through the desert to some God forsaken mud hole of a town, just to waste about 300 or 400 guys who go up against him? Why it all matters I don't know. There were so many people getting shot that it was hard to remember what the story was about but it really wasn't worth remembering anyway."
1,Django is djust dreadful,"I head a lot of good things about this -- comparisons to Leone's films and that it was so popular it spawned a horde of sequals. I had contemplated buying the Anchor Bay DVD, and upon viewing, I'm so glad I didn't. Franco Nero is absolutely dreadful -- i'm not sure if he or the dubbing is to blame but the delivery and dialogue are some of the worst I've ever witnessed. The character is such a goody goody with lines like, ""You shouldn't treat women like that"" and ""That's not right."" To compare this to Leone is to reduce Leone's interesting characters and cinematography into cardboard gunfights. I didn't even finish the film."
1,Taste has tumbled,"This used to be one of our favorite soups. Taste/quality has gone in the wrong direction, and so we will not purchase again. Gave away the remaining 11 cans of the pack to a food drive at our church along with some other items which had a much more favorable flavor."
2,Not nearly as good as the Kirkland-Campbell Tomato Bisque,"One of the main reasons I used to have for going to Costco was the delicious tomato bisque they used to have. It was a Kirkland-Campbell Tomato Bisque and I would buy it by the dozens. Unfortunately, I can't find it there any more. Checked two stores already, none to be found. So I tried Amazon and the closest match I could find. But it has very little to do with the bisque I loved so much. Now I am stuck with 11 cans I have no use for. Any suggestions?"
3,Very Basic,"I buy as many Office/Word/VBA books as I can get my hands on... You never know where you are going to get that little piece of knowledge that will help. Now you know why I bought this book.This book was good, but pretty basic. I expected much more out of it. For what it's worth, I bought this around the same time I bought ""Learn Word 2000 VBA Document Automation"" - which is a GREAT book on Word programming (probably the only book that shows you how to automate documents in several different ways).Anyway, if I were starting out, just learning how to write macros, this would be a great book and would've gotten five stars. I think the title and subject matter are a little deceiving though. It is definitely comprised of introductory material. Happy programming."
2,web support gone,"The publisher classifies this book as a ""beginning level"" on the back cover, so it's hard to complain that this is accurate. However, the web support for the book is gone, and downloads that it draws upon are therefore not available anymore."
4,buy it,another great album from a great rock band that never got there due credit they have so many great songs buy this album and you will not be disapointed
4,"Not bad , not for beginners","This book is really not bad. It explains Jini in a straight forward manner, and is very useful for one that starts to learn Jini. It might be hard to understand for someone that knows Java and has no experiences in distributed objects, but don't blame the authors, distributed objects is not an easy topic. If it is the first touch to distributed objects, this book is NOT for you.This book is not sufficiently self-contained , readers should at least read the Jini specification to understand what the authors of this book try to explain. Remember, this is a Nutshell book: It is more compact and economically correct..;-). If you have experiences in distributed objects, I think other book that you need to read is the specification of Jini itself."
3,No better than off the shelf shirts,"This shirt feels like it should last long enough to justify price. It doesn't. I've had 4 of these for less than a year and the collars tend to sit poorly and come out of the wash with a crease about mid collar. The black shirt faded within a couple washes in cold water, the yellow one is developing a curious hole in th collar, and the blue one is looking a bit thread bare around the cuffs. I've had cheap off the shelf shirts last longer. I am not particularly rough with my shirts.Also these are heavier than some and so in warm climates will be less comfortable."
3,"Nice quality shirt, disappointed with fit.","I just purchased one of the Traveler Tailored fit dress shirts after being disappointed with how an Eagle Slim fit dress shirt fit me. I had high hopes for it after reading on their website that the tailored fit shirt is cut 5 inches narrower than the regular fit shirts. The shirt seems to be of very nice quality but I am equally disappointed with the fit. I have a 16.5 inch neck and a 34 inch waist. The shirt looks loose, baggy, and anything but tailored when tucked into dress slacks. I can only imagine how generously cut the regular fit shirts are if this is supposed to be a tailored fit."
3,"Good quality, but abridged","This is excellent for a free edition, but is abridged. Anyone who wants to get the essence of the work should buy this edition, but for the complete work, try other editions."
4,Democracy in America,My fiance is taking an advanced level government course and it was one of her required readings. I decided to expand my horizons and read along with her. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to know history of our government and how we were perceived historically.
3,No ToC!,There's no table of contents in this edition which is very frustrating for a work this long. Hopefully the editors can make changes and include an update with a ToC
3,"Good, but it seems better from the product description","It is a good product, you will read a full version of such an important book. But I thought I was buying just a cheap version, not a notepad version, which is what actually is. A purely notepad written version of the book. It doesn`t affect the content, but it clearly bothers after sometime reading.If you are really willing to read this book and don`t have any money, it is a good choice. But if I were you, I would take some time and save some money to buy a better version."
2,It was alright...,"While listening to Sleepy Brown's album, I was amped to hear some smooth groves and soul. I was pondering on whether I would buy it while I bobbed my head to the music video for ""Margarita"" because I liked that song a lot. But while I listened to the album, I noticed that it remained even throughout. There was never a bad song or a really great song. It was at a steady pace the entire time, sort of like listening to Sade or someone of that nature. When ""Underwater Love"" came on, I was pleasantly surprised that he did have one head bobber that made me want to dance, but other than that, the album was at a medium pace. I don't love it. I don't hate it. I'm just indifferent about it. I would replay ""Underwater Love"" in heavy rotation, but I'm not sure I'll buy it."
2,"he ain't no solo Artist,a few moments here&there","Sleepy Brown has the same problem that Nate Dogg has&that is why he is one heck of a Hook Artist he is just a dime a dozen as a Solo Artist. the first single ""Margarita"" right off the bat showed he was gonna be a Hook Artist on his project. now this album has good instrumentation which you'd expect since Sleepy's Pop's was in the 70's R&B Band Brick. but there is nothing here that has what Brick had&that is a stand out jam to get your bounce to. Sleepy's best stuff is still working on Hooks with Outkast&Goodie Mob,etc... but as a Solo Artist it just ain't happening."
1,A total disapointment...,"Dude is only good for solo hooks and nothing else. Definately, save your money because he can't even perform solo on stage or in the studio.LOL"
4,Mr.Brown has arrived,"This is one for the ages. A very soulful,jazzy cd. The songs are short,but sweet. Worth every penny."
4,Excellent book as far as it goes,"The author of this book is focused particularly on the phenomenon of the ""bystander"", not the perpetrators or the victims of the Holocaust. As such, it is an excellent study of the subject. I am reading it a second time, and this time around I am more aware that one area is dark: the complicity of corporations in the Holocaust. She does, however, discuss the failure of churches and NGOs to aid the Jews in their time of need, which amounts to a gross complicity. Corporations in the US and elsewhere were making Holorinth machine cards,selling the Germans autos, trucks, etc. But given the area of focus the author sets out in the beginning, it is an excellent study of its kind."
5,Works Great in the Sun,"I've tried these traps in several locations, and I think I've found the trick: they need to be in a location that gets full sun to work best. I have one hanging in an all-day-shade location and one hanging in a full-afternoon sun location. The afternoon-sun trap has, in one day, caught more than 20 yellow jackets, several flies, and assorted stinging things (no honey bees, thank goodness). The shaded trap caught a wasp and a couple of flies. The traps are less than 100 feet apart-the shade is the only difference. This is going to be another bad yellow jacket year in much of the U.S., so get this trap and the reusable Rescue yellow jacket trap soon. Good luck!"
5,Holy Moly!!!,"First off,if you have yellow jackets you need this trap! We had one around for a couple years, but this summer the little devils started to bother us so I hung it up. Little did I know! I thought there might be a dozen or so. Well! On the side of the trap are indicator lines 1/2"" apart and the statement that 1/2"" equals around 300 jackets. If that is accurate then we caught over 1000 critters in the first week!! That pretty much bagged the whole outfit bacause in the following week there were almost none. Needless to say, I ordered more and will always have a couple on hand. By the way, if you've never used these, I would suggest setting them up either early morning or late evening when they are not active because they REALLY LIKE the lure and will show up immediatly! This is a must have if you live in yellow jacket country!"
1,didn't work for me,"used about 3 of these over a two year period, although in partly shaded places, and never caught any YJs. The reusable rescue trap(which I guess i am having trouble finding in stores now) worked fairly well. I did use water as per instructions, however. did not try the apple juice thing.Guess people don't find this review helpful, that is OK. There might be regional differences or other poorly understood factors. Just my experience with the product. The YJ problem is so bad around our property(especially after mild winter) got stung several times this year and personally destroyed 2 underground nests, yet they are still around. Have heard they can forage for a quarter of a mile away. We live in one of the Gulf Coast states and maybe that is a factor. Maybe our YJs are smarter than the ones in other places, who knows. I have to try this again but will use apple juice mixture this time."
1,Terrible,"How did this product even get 1 good review? Terrible, sat right next to a whole swarm practically that was coming to my pool to drink water every day. After 7 days, it caught NOTHING. Took it down and tossed in the trash. DO NOT BUY THIS, you will be disappointed."
1,This Yellow Jacket Control Trap is a no go for the hornet problem in my area.,"My yard is being overwhelmed by meat eating, territorial swarms of hornets all over the place. I purchased two of these disposable Yellow Jacket Control traps to try in help trap & get rid of the big hornet problem that I am having in my area. I placed 2 of these traps out in my property about 2 weeks ago. I went out every day since then to see if these disposable traps were doing their job & catching any of the nasty hornets that were taking over my property. After 2 weeks of being setup, only one hornet was caught & trapped in one these worthless traps.I would not recommend the (Rescue Yellow Jacket Control Trap) for trapping & getting rid of hornets because apparently the hornets are not attracted or interested in this kind of trap for some reason. The attractant included for this disposable Yellow Jacket just smells like White Vinegar if I am correct. This trap gets an (F) grade for failing!!!"
1,Don't believe the great reviews,"I bought this product because of the postive reviews. What a waste! Since I have captured 0 yellow jackets I wish I could give it 0 stars. I have moved the trap several times; in the sun, out of the sun, etc but have not caught anything. I really have to think about those other reviews, maybe some of them work for this company."
2,Bad Instructions for use ....,"I followed the directions to the tee. It did not mention anything about diluting with anything but water.I set the trap out in the evening: 9:00 Aug. 1st. I just checked now, 6:30 PM Aug. 2nd and not one insect except the ones that were pictured on the product. The so called white packet of attractant did NOT dissolve. Maybe they should have recommended using HOT water.I will need to go out there tonight and attempt to shake up the packet in hopes that the attractant dissipates.What a royal pain ...... If I have any luck I will write another review.Mary"
1,"Used to be great, I wonder if they changed the formula of the attractant","We had used this in the past. Got them locally at a hardware store, and they were incredible. Within a day the trap had a lot of yellow jackets, and it kept trapping them for a week or so. It was so effective that we stopped seeing yellow jackets in our yard. We used them successfully for two years in a row.The next year we ordered them online, and never had good result. We had a huge nest by one of our windows. We placed one of the traps far away (about 25-30 yards) and one very close to the nest (about 2 feet away), and the most we trapped were fruit flies.The design is great, and it is very practical to toss the whole thing, wasps and all, instead of trying to wash them (like some of the other models), but if the attractant doesn't work, wasps will never get in the trap, defeating the whole purpose.Please bring back the old attractant."
4,Works for me,Had one of these up for just over a week. Its quickly filling up with dead wasps. Almost too effective - wondering if l'm bringing all the neighbors wasps to my garden?Main negative is that its a bag full of water and dead insects hanging from a tree - difficult to move once you've set it.
2,Nice design - poor attractant,"I've had this up for a week and it's got one yellow jacket. I notice that some people recommend apple juice, but the instructions say to just add water.I'm very disappointed.I added some sugar today and possibly other ingredients in the future to make this more attractive.Their fly catcher is great, but this one works poorly for St. Louis yellow jackets."
1,Don't waste your money,I have had two of these traps up near my pool. I have a ton of yellow jackets but haven't caught a single one in the traps. Don't be fooled by the yellow jackets printed on the outside.
3,Not so sure about this trap,I live in the bayou of La...and apparently the wasps around here are not fooled easily! I hung several different types of traps around my yard and nothing seemed to work!
1,Don't catch Yellow Jackets,Their old attractant caught TONS of yellow jackets so I am experienced with this trap. The white attractant has not caught anything except a few flies and crickets. The company is great however and has agreed to work with me if I continue to be dis-satisfied. I am giving it one more try and using apple juice this time instead of water.
1,Not even one wasp!,"I bought one of these traps at a big box store. Installed in my front yard because we have a yellowjacket wasp nest near the front of the house and I wanted to get rid of them. After following the instructions carefully, and hanging the trap about 30 feet or so away, I am sad to say that it has not trapped even one wasp (or any other insect except 5 or 6 tiny flies). After 3 days I moved the trap to another location closer to the nest, but a week later still nothing. So, I conclude that it doesn't work and can't recommend it. Waste of my money, I'm afraid."
3,What the ...?,"This album is not so well recorded (muddy), with a little bit of shaky singing (who is that poor hollering girl?!?)on the 1st track, and it all just sounds amateurish ..I've read this is supposed to be a masterpiece. Well i would not go that far. But it sets you in a certain kind of mood, a certain vibe (i guess this is what the record is famous for) and i agree there is a certain charm to the whole 'style' and IT IS 'a trip' and 'psychedelic', and drugged out...but it sure requires one to be in a certain mood too, to be able to enjoy it!"
3,Had to return it,"After only a week, I clearly noticed a memory improvement. But Darn! I am also allergic to one of the ingredients because it caused a rash on both sides of my torso. It took a while to clear up after I discontinued. So now I'm trying out Standard Poors Ginko version -- so far no rash :)"
1,Not a good everyday supplement,"I rated this item one star since I had bad experience with taking it and withdrawal effects.The Ginko part is great, but it has L-Dopa which is precursor to dopamine , a major neurotransmitter in the brain. taking this supplement regularly will make you sleepy and if you stop it suddenly will cause depression symptoms.Please read more about the supplements content before buying any."
5,Works Great!,"I'm in sales, so I really need to be sharp, focused and energetic. This product has given me all three beyond what I expected."
3,Timex Radio Controled Watch,"This watch works very well with it's radio control time update, ease of setup, and functionality is good. Also, instructions were straight forward and easy to follow. The watch band seems to be very durable and comfortable enough. On the downside, the watch is a bit more bulky and heavier than most digital watches that I've used. The bezel is a silver painted plastic and the paint is wearing off making it look a little unsightly. If the watch band has to be adjusted, you must either move a pin or for the smaller wrist a link or links must be removed."
3,Great watch,"Great watch. Very readable. But, I cannot change Date format from DD/MM to MM/DD as per instructions."
3,Magical Moon Parfum - Spicy scent.,"I purchased this perfume based on the blend of Rose, Sugar Cane, Berries, Patchouli, Vanilla, Musk, White Sandalwood, Coconut Milk, Guava Nectar provided in the decription. I was looking for something new and decided to take a chance, as I have never smelled this perfume before. I can definetly smell the sandalwood, musk, patchouli. My husband thought it was a little strong - but I purchased the Eau De Parfum so the smell would last. I like the smell other than a powdery smell which might be the rose. It is a bit overwhelming when I first put it on. It has a spicy scent, which is what I was looking for. Would I buy it again? Probably not. But it is a nice change for me. The packaging was super. The bottle is very pretty. The shipping was fast. Very happy with the company."
3,"a nice read, but not essential","I enjoyed reading this book. It was entertaining, but had little weight to it. It is not like 777 or The Golden Bough, so it won't be used for reference. It is a rather light read.I would recomend it if you are a magician and would like to do some recreational reading.It is not a bad book, it is humorus and well written; it flows well too. It is simply that I expected it to contain some new revelations on the nature of Thelema or magick, but in reality, it contains mostly things that are in the core book.Might be usefull to someone who is entirely new to magick or Thelema."
5,A Good Book,"Duquette imparts knowledge to the seeker with a sense of humor and common sense. Not really an essential book at all, but entertaining and intriguing. I prefer his other books, the Illustrated Geotia and The Magick of Aleister Crowley. This is more for the intermediate student. I am more advanced and I didn't get much out of this book aside from a few nice laughs."
4,A view of a path,"While the author dosn't follow the same studies that I do, it is very interesting to see the development and workings of someone studying in the occult. A very good book to read just for that."
4,A multiple view,"It was an interesting read and would be worth it for many people wanting to learn. I have a few problems with his Kabbalah information, but I tend to have those with almost anyone who dosn't get it right by Jewish standards. :)"
2,not really a bad read but...,"i've found him to repeat himself from other publications and well although i don't remember any key points out of this book, i didn't really enjoy it. even though most of the book is nothing but compiled essays, it didn't reach me with interest as ""my life with the spirits"" did."
5,Best sled EVER!,"We got two of these sleds for our kids last fall. We live in the mountains and get LOTS of snow. Our two boys were out on the sleds every day. After just a few runs they could easily get the sleds to turn and carve. They rode on their bellies, on their backs, sitting down, two on a sled - and there was lots of laughing. The sleds are still in good shape, broken in but ready for another winter."
1,No quality control!,"Do not buy this product unless you have a woodworking shop and an insatiable desire to build your own sled. The quality control in their Chinese manufacturing plant must be non-existent. The holes to bolt the sled together are totally out of alignment and must be redrilled, and the threads into which to insert the bolds are themselves improperly set (at bad angles)."
4,can't wait to use it,"It hasn't snowed since we bought it, but we'll be ready for next year! It's a really beautiful looking machine."
2,Wouldn't recommend it,I should have checked netflix or something before buying this. It's a boring movie and really awkward. This girl just throws herself at the guy and has no self respect... I don't like movies where the women are dumb or easy and still get the guy.
4,Jersey Girl,Did not mean to purchase VHS as have not watched this particular purchase. I have seen on television and like it very much
2,Pretty Lame,"I thought this movie was pretty bad. It was SO easy to predict. Liv Tyler's role was so small, I think she is a lovely actress, who made a bad choice to work in such a cheesy movie.Ben Affleck may be fabulous eye candy, but I must say, his acting abilities are lacking substance.Overall, I would skip this one all together. Even as a rental."
4,great comedy hybrid,"I felt like this movie captured a wide range of emotions very well and still maintained very smooth scene transitions. The story was unique, the directing was in-tuned, and the acting was some of the best we've seen from Affleck, Tyler, and Carlin, but the real talent in this movie is most clearly Raquel Castro as little Gertie Trinke. She gives a flawless performance and shows she is in the elite league of actresses at her young age. The entire cast really melded together beautifully with each still maintaining their individually complex roles this is undoubtly due to Kevin Smith who writes and directs Jersey Girl to its full emotional potential."
4,"Don't listen to critics, this is a great movie","Kevin Smith got panned for this flick, but that is only because everyone was expecting Jay and Silent Bob to show up and start telling fart jokes. This is a good flick, despite all the negative reviews this movie got. It does have some really funny moments, however the flick is primarily about the main character's transition into a completely different type of life. Some of George Carlin's best acting is in this film. Most people will probably enjoy this flick, so long as they don't go in expecting ""Clerks 3"" or something similar."
4,This Jersey Girl loved Jersey Girl,This movie is very sweet and you gotta love Dylan McDermott. Even though the movie was filmed in the early 90's ~ it brings back a little bit of nostalgia ~ wardrobe that is ~ especially if you were born and raised in Jersey! All Jersey Girls will love this movie.
4,Love this movie!!,"While I don't love Ben Affleck, I loved this movie. Kevin Smith is a great filmmaker because he knows what is a great idea. I loved the little girl in this movie, struggling to identify who she and who her family is. George Carlin is also great in a more serious role. Definitely recommmend this movie!"
2,I thought this was a family film?,"First the movie in it self wasn't bad, BUT the fact that it was said to be a family film it is not. Last I checked a family film did have swearing in it all the time. And not to mention the scene about self gradification. I mean come on. Kevin Smith obviously doesn't know how to make a family film. I would take my kids to see this movie. And now I heard he's going to ruin the Green Hornet. He should stay in his own little world of rounchy jokes and stupid sight gags."
1,COMPLETE GARBAGE FROM START TO FINISH.,"(...). Many people (aside from me) failed to keep from laughing out loud at his most poignant scenes -- he's just completely unbelievable. Liv Tyler gives a nice performance, and the bit parts of Steven Root are quite funny. But at this point, George Carlin is not the funny man he used to be, but just a bitter old man.I truly hope Kevin Smith doesn't feel like he's got to keep casting Ben Affleck. I'd like to be able to enjoy his films again. This was complete garbage from start to finish."
2,The plot premise is ridiculous...,"SPOILER AHEAD.1) I moved several times before age 10, and you forget about your old friends and make new ones very fast. So the fact that Ollie wouldn't move because of his 7 year old is ludicrous.2) Why could he take the job and commute to NY? Thousands of people do it everyday.3) The romance was too shallow to believe it meant anything to anyone."
3,NOT BAD! (3 1/2 STARS),"Not a movie I ever would have rented, butI caught it on cable today, and it wasactually good. I wouldn't say it's afamily film, but it will hold your attention!The little girl in this film is really cute,and lovable. Enjoyable movie!"
4,"A Kevin Smith interpretation of ""romantic comedy""","Kevin Smith is best known for his Jay & Silent Bob series of films, which are good in their own right (personally, I think Dogma is his best work to date). Jersey Girl, as a more mainstream movie for Smith, is a pleasant surprise. The story revolves around Ben Affleck's character, Ollie, losing his wife during childbirth and raising his newborn daughter, Gertie, alone. While Gertie is still an infant, Ollie destroys his publicity career during at a promotional event for Will Smith (which leads to a fun cameo later in the movie). Generally, I don't like romantic comedies, but Kevin Smith puts a unique and fun spin on the genre."
5,If you know what a guido is....,"This movie is great if you grew up knowing what a guido was, teased your hair, wore bright pink lipstick, and hung out w/ guys who drove Camaros. Jami Gertz is great, and Dylan McDermott is well...he just is. That's enough for me! Definitely a good movie if you grew up in NJ."
2,I Was Glad Whent it Was Over,"The good thing I can say about the movie is that I laughed once or twice.Ok, now on to the bad things. The plot was shaky at best. The forced humor often missed and was not funny. There were many inappropriate situations including when Liv Tyler kept talking about Ben Affleck watching [...], then throwing herself at him by offering him meaningless sex. Then there was the EXCESSIVE language. Ugh.NOTE TO PARENTS: Don't let your kids watch this. Period."
2,a movie about how boring growing up is,"Kevin Smith writes a ""grown up"" script that is almost Disney, Ben Affleck squanders his talents yet again (the guy has a brain, why does he only play stern or endearing? or loutish.) Affleck's character acts grown up (conservative, altruistic) at a moment in his real life when he was really struggling with growing up issues (ie settling down with jHo), which makes this film interesting only as an artifact of tabloid culture. The people who made this film are too happy to be interesting."
4,Review for the 80s Jersey Girl,"I think the majority of these reviews are for the wrong movie. This is the Jersey Girl that came out in the 80s and stars Jamie Gertz and Dermot Mulroney, not the Jersey Girl that stars Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. If you are looking for a review of the Ben Affleck version, then I can't help you. But I can tell you that 80s version is pretty silly and predictable, but I absolutely love it. It's one of those movies I watch every time it comes on TV, so I decided it was time to buy it. So glad Amazon has it in stock! I have always liked Jamie Gertz and I am a child of the 80s, so I guess that's why I like it so much. Plus Dermot Mulroney is pretty darn hot in it. It's the classic girl gets boy, girl loses boy, girl gets boy back plot. Love it!"
3,Jersey Girl is adorable,"I love this movie. However, the description includes a phrase about Dylan McDermott's character being a single father. He does not have any children in this movie. Jami Gertz' character is a Pre-School Teacher, however, and she is wonderful with the children. This is good to watch with gal pals or with one's significant other."
4,Very cute!,"I thought this was witty and very cute! It really makes you stop and think about your own priorities in life. My 8 year old daughter loved this and the humor was light and quite honestly, I was really laughing! A good rental!"
5,stories from the heart,"I waited a long time before watching this movie but I recently watched it on cable the other day and I was really moved by how well this movie was produced. Kevin Smith is one of the best independent directors to ever grace the industry. With such classic films as Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back, Dogma ... Jersey Girl marks a stunning new direction for this wonderful director.With a talented cast, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Jason Biggs and George Carlin, this film should be everyone's must have list. Jennifer Lopez, in a small role really manages to take the opening of the film and while Ben Affleck isn't that great of an actor, Kevin Smith manages to set him on the correct path and with the supporting cast you can't help but wonder if Kevin Smith will make more films like this ... movies who tell stories from the heart."
4,Enjoyed it!!,Jersey Girl is a nice movie. I enjoyed it very much and the cast was great! Go see it! The music played throughout the movie is fantastic. Can't wait for the soundtrack.
1,A great cure for isommnia,"Ben Affleck plays a succesful career man whose wife dies in childbirth, leaving him to raise their baby daughter. He loses his high-powered job and finds himself living with his crusty but lovable father, meets spirited but lovable Liv Tyler, and discovers (surprise, surprise) that love is more important than success.This is an extremely dull film, with almost nothing in it to amuse or interest. There is a briefly entertaining cameo by Will Smith, but it is over all too quickly. The finale, where father and daughter do a duet from the musical 'Sweeney Todd' at the school pageant, causing the headmistress to faint with shock, raises a faint smile, though one couldn't help wondering, where was she when rehearsals were going on? It's hard to believe that this bland and almost instantly forgettable film came from the makers of 'Dogma'. A great disappointment."
4,Really fun modern romance.,"Although not a great film, Jersey Girl is a well-done -- and very enjoyable -- version of the classic Cinderella story. In this case Cinderella (played by beautiful Jami Gertz) is a very pretty but very unsophisticated girl from New Jersey who sets out to find a Prince Charming in Manhattan. She succeeds in meeting him by accidentally wrecking his new Mercedes with her dilapidated Volkswagen. The subsequent events in their developing relationship are similarly unconventional, and even nearly disastrous. Nevertheless -- as it must in any good telling of the Cinderella story -- love wins out in the end. This movie isn't quite on a par with Pretty Woman, but it is an awful lot of fun."
4,This movie got a raw deal,"The whole J-Lo & Ben drama gave this movie an extremely raw deal. This movie was actually pretty good. It wasn't Oscar or Golden Globe good but it was good enough and should have received a better box office take than it got. Unfortunately it got caught up in the Bennifer atmosphere. I'm no fan of Ben Affleck, and his crummy treatment of Jennifer Lopez. I'm also no fan of Jennifer Lopez and her treatment of everyone. But Miss.Castro just steals your heart and it made me believe that Ben could actually be a pretty good dad. The whole play scene where they did the Swinney Todd song had me rolling. I've seen Swinney Todd so I knew what the play was about and the song, so it was fun to watch them do it and the teacher not have a clue about the play.Either way this movie got a raw deal at the movie theaters and I hope more people watch the DVD and forget about the Bennifer [...]."
3,Not half bad tearjerker,"True, this features Bennifer at the start, at what must have been the end of their relationship. It's also got one of the last appearances by the late George Carlin, and, of course, Liv Tyler is always smashing. She even lisps her way through some ""Elv-ish"" in one of the extras. The plot is man-rediscovers-what-is-really-important-in-life. Naturally, that means a cute kid, a grumpy dad and an understanding girlfriend. This could have been made in the 50s. But it's really ok. I'd watch it if I were you."
3,"Not bad . . ,","Actually I liked Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler together. And I thought the movie was nice actually - I just couldn't stand the little girl that played the daughter. Just too precocious and a bit over acting done here (the scene where her Dad shows up for the play - the camera shot on her face, please!). And speaking of plays - come one! Sweeney Todd (yeah, right) at a school play, complete with elaborate stage set??!! and costumes?Sorry, just found the daughter too irritating (much like her mother:)"
2,Even Better than Gigli!,"Despite some brief moments of brilliance (e.g., you show me yours I'll show you mine, and a brief encounter between Ben and another well-known star) this movie is mundane and tedious, and Ben's acting has never been worse. Very disappointing film from Kevin Smith. Should have been a made-for-TV movie."
1,Such a Cliché,"This movie is so predicatable, boring and such a cliché! So not Kevin Smith at all. Which is what I expected, but I still watched it openly. But it was just so awful, trust me - skip on this one, you won't regret it."
1,An Insult to All,"This movie was equally demeaning to the actors and the audience. Start with Working Girl, substitute New jersey for Staten Island, then take away the plot, the character development and just about everything else and you're left with the big hair and a plotless love story. Jamie Gertz has had much better material to work with and Dylan McDermott's primary mode of expression in this role is a lazy smile. Give the actor some dialogue! The ending was so contrived that there's no reward for sticking with this movie to the end. You know how it will turn out just from reading the marquis."
2,"Good story idea, but carried out in a bad way","The basic idea of this story is good: a father learning how to raise his daughter while also trying to cope with the loss of his wife and the fact that his daughter's birth caused his wife's death. What could have been great was botched, however. There was too much profanity. I find it in very bad taste to use profanity in front of children. I also found there to be too much sex in the movie. They could have developed the plot without that. I did like the Will Smith side jokes in there, however."
1,Garbage,"Poor acting all around, Horrible storyline. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. You'll thank me."
1,Crazy girl is more like it!,"An obnoxious attempt to make a screwball comedy: a deranged girl plots to get a guy by literally running into him. She decides on the spot he's the one for her, based solely on superficial appearances, and then she begins stalking him! That she succeeds in getting this guy is something that could only happen in a movie as dopey as this.Jami Gertz's performance was one long screech while Dylan McDermott's was based solely on his ability to smile and look good. This was no Cinderella story; this is why they have restraining orders!Not a keeper!"
5,I don't care I enjoyed this movie!,"Being a father and also being a Kevin SMith fan, this movie was easy to connect with, I also have a daughter and a big ambition to make movies, it is also something that gets in the way of being a dad. A great movie."
4,"Sweet, funny, and heartwarming","I almost didn't go to this movie because of the negative reviews, but I'm really glad I did. I went with two friends, and we're all fairly picky viewers, but we all loved it. It was sweet and funny, and I was sorry to see it end. This isn't an ""edgy"" movie, so if that's what you're looking for, don't bother--but if you're looking for a funny movie that will touch your heart, check this one out for sure."
4,Not your typical Kevin Smith film,"People who went because of Kevin Smith's prior body of work will be disappointed and those that stayed away because of his prior body of work will also be disappointed. This is a very light and formulaic romantic comedy but should resonate with any parent. The characters are likable the situations are light and entertaining. Liv Tyler and George Carlin make up for the normal Affleck personality void (I think the only person he has showed chemistry with has been Matt Damon). This movie will provide for a few laughs, a tear or two, and will leave you with a nice feel good feeling in the end."
4,JERSEY GIRL,"I love this movie, I'm a sucker for the underdog love stories, and Jamie Gertz is one of my favorite actresses."
5,a both heartbreaking and funny movie- Amazing! :) :),"One word-Briliant! I loved this movie. It is sad and happy at the same time..The wife, Gertrid, dies at child-birth but at the same time, brings new life into the world, who just happens to be named after her..This movie made me cry and also made me laugh..It is wonderful..i have rented it several times and also went to see it in theatures..in my own words:"" You will break out in laughter and also drown in tears at certain times in the movie""..It is terrific! Make sure you add this film to your collection! :)"
3,CALIENTE!,"Cute film with minimal cinematic value; plays like a TV movie made by Lifetime, but it's a sweet story, Jamie Gertz is charming, and, uh, Dylan McDermott gets as naked as you'll ever get to see him, and girls (and boys), and fans, he's hot. They should call this movie BODY BY GOD."
5,You're not that guy anymore .... from New York to New Jersey,"Is a whole different world away.... Ollie's entire life changes from hot New York music publicist to blue collar working man in New Jersey in the blink of an eye. When his daughter is born her mother (Jennifer Lopez) dies suddenly leaving him a widowed single father who needs his dad's help to raise a child. Even though Ollie keeps wishing for his old life back ... it takes a new love (Liv Tyler) to tell him ""You're not that guy anymore""."
4,not quite as good as his eels stuff...,"but still worth owning. I don't own the followup, but if this is any indication, E's solo work previous to the eels had that same characteristic smart bitter, funny and sad all at once songwriting style to it, but with much more of a one dimensional singer-songwriter kind of feel to it that occasionally spoiled the proceedings by making things sound too samey. Aside from the cute instrumental ""symphony for toy piano..."", on every song he's backed up by an acoustic guitar, a keyboard, and a percussion track that may or may not be a drum machine, all of which sound like they're produced and mixed the same way in every song. It's probably not a coincidence that one of the key reasons E formed the eels was to get more of a full sound. Still, the songwriting is very strong as evidenced by tracks like ""hello cruel world"", ""mockingbird franklin"", and especially ""you'll be the scarecrow"""
2,Is this really the same E I'm thinking about?,"Being a big Eels fan, I was quite excited to finally find A Man Called E today. After being sickened by the the first half of the first song, I went to track 2. 30 seconds later, I switch to track 3, 4, 5...nothing but cheesy early-90's pop rock. Then he threw in Symphony For Toy Piano In G Minor, and I thought ""That's more like it."" Then there were about 5 more useless tunes, and it's done. I'm sorry, but A Man Called E just can't compete with the originality of Beautiful Freak, and the beauty of Electro-Shock Blues (which can only be described as a masterpiece). I can't wait for Daisies of the Galaxy. As for now, I'm just going to put A Man Called E up on the shelf and maybe listen to it again in a couple years."
3,For Eels diehards,"Has a few good songs, but is before all of E's family turmoil, and seems fluffy compared to the much deeper stuff the Eels put out later. Personally, I'm a big Eels fan, so it was worth it for me to satisfy the curiousity of hearing the early work. It's not bad either, just don't expect the same deep lyrics & catchy licks you get on ""Electro-shock Blues"" or ""Blinking Lights"". Try ""Beautiful Freak"" first, and if you love that then you'll like this one."
2,misleading,"I received the product, but it looks nothing like in the picture. Picture has it looking like hardwood imitation or hardwood. I received cheap white plastic looking thing. Nothing like image except for the shape. Thank you very much!"
1,stuff is not as shown!!!,Springfield Precision 90117 Thermometer/Humidity MeterThe thermometer that I received is not 'Woodstone' as shown but cheap 'White Plastic'????
5,Perfect,"I had previously purchased another frame drum, a bodhrán, but it wasn't what I had been expecting. So I did more research, and purchased this product instead.I wanted a frame drum that you could play with your fingers as in middle eastern style. I got exactly what I wanted with this drum. It's nice and deep, and has a range of tones depending on where you strike it with your fingers and the way in which you strike it. It seems to sustain a good bit of pressure, so there's no fear of breaking the skin accidentally.I put a string through the provided holes, so now I can play it while standing up as well, hanging the drum from around my neck, and the sound is even better this way."
5,Excelent book on Object-Oriented Programming,"This book gave me an ability to understand principles of OOP as they are presented in MS Visual Basic. It was a different experience from what I knew and used in everyday practice as Java Programmer. Also, this was the only book that I could find that would use normal, useful examples."
2,VB OOP Poor Book,I regret that I have bought this useless book. This book does not teach you OO concepts well. The title of this book is misleading.All the VB examples are not practical and cannot illustrate the power of Object Oriented Programming. Some examples on the CD-ROM contain errors and some are meaningless. It also teaches ActiveX controls and components but you still do not know how to use them after you have read it.I bought it because I cannot find the 'Learn to Program Objects With Visual Basic 6' by Active Path in HK. This is the worst VB book I have ever found in the bookshop.This book is not for beginners and advanced users too!I regret that I have paid for such a useless book.
2,Disappointing,"When I was a kid, me and the neighbor kids got together and decided to make a movie one day. We used a camcorder that their parents owned, and used their back yard as our set. Ketchup was blood. Ikari is several orders of magnitude better than what we produced. That does not mean that this is a good film, however. The narrative is not bad. The rest is. I am a fan of anime, and in the context of anime, this doesn't measure up, despite the creators' best intentions. I feel like I could have done something better with the eighty or so minutes I spent watching. Sorry, I had high hopes. Fans of anime looking for a live action approach should try the subtitled version of Kung Fu Hustle. Yes, it's produced by a big studio with a lot of money, not a noble indie film maker. The fact remains that Kung Fu Hustle is a good movie, and Ikari isn't."
2,Not as described,The product did not seem to be as advertised. It was not described as having to be screwed on permanently. Would have been a problem for others in the household.
3,Good value,"I purchased this product because I was having a total knee replacement and needed a higher toilet seat temporarily. This toilet seat was very sturdy and I felt secure using it. One complaint was that it is not really ""elongated."" Yes, it fit on my elongated toilet bowl, but the opening itself is not elongated, which was a disappointment. Overall, though, a good value for the short time I needed it."
2,boring,slow and boring not good acting skill at that time.keshia still needed time to grow in this film but it was a good effort
1,What About Your Friends,"I have never seen this version but I love the original. I remember watching it on HBO when it came out in 95. I hope it comes out on DVD or at least a VHS will somehow appear on Amazon.Plot Outline: ""What About Your Friends"" is a one-hour film that takes a unique look at the senior year successes and failures of three high school girlfriends as they prepare for college.Monica Calhoun .... Temple BahamJonas Chaka .... NeilAlbert Hall .... Mr. BlackBruklin Harris .... AlexTyrin Turner .... ReggieLark Voorhies .... SabrinaMalinda Williams .... Alex"
5,Faultlines is faultless,i've enjoyed this CD for many years and look forward to hear more of what this artist can produce.The songs are soothing yet sophisticated. Even my baby falls asleep to the song 'private world'.
4,"Great Lyrics, tasteful writing, very addictive","I saw this guy a few years ago while living in Philadelpia, and finally found his CD here. This is really intelligent music, with a very distinct voice. I recommend it to almost anyone. It's hard to compare, but it's a little mellencamp/dylan/costello, but some of the production is pretty ambitious. 4 stars."
1,It's a joke,"The CD's do look like they are made from someones home. When I opened it, some of the CD's fell out. They are not securely placed in there, making it easy for the CD's to get scratched.More importantly is the learning process. It turned me off. The english speaking guy is so monotone and drab. He asks the spanish speaker to say this, now say that, lets learn this word now. He doesn't tie anything together, I find it hard to learn and pick up on it. THE PIMSLEUR method is better. I learn so much quicker, and immediately from the beginning of the CD.It was definately a waste of my money."
3,This CD set needs work...,"The CDs in this package are lifted right off a cassette tape, so there are only 2 tracks per CD. That means that if you are listening on a portable CD player, and you want to repeat something, you can't go back a short distance--you have to go all the back to the beginning. It's a real pain.In addition, the booklet that accompanies the CDs only loosely follows the tape, which is also a pain. You spend a lot of time flipping through the book to try to find what they are covering on the tape."
2,This is a waste of money,"This CD set was a complete letdown. [...] the CD case is cheap. You open it, and the CDs fall out. The CDs are clearly just made in a CD burner.What's worse is the content. You will NOT learn Spanish through this program. I studied Spanish in college, and I know this is nowhere near a complete course. It doesn't bother teaching the past tense! You learn just the present tense and a tiny, tiny bit of the future tense.The Spanish speaker is excellent, I must say, but the English speaker [...]will put you to sleep. He reads like a robot: ""O...K...Luis....now...we...will...dis...cuss...the ..numbers...in...span...ish."" BORING! Nothing is tied together--it's just a bunch of random commentary thrown out at you.I'm sure there are much better courses available."
1,Buyer Beware!!!!,"I bought this CD set to further my spanish, however when I recieved the CD's and played them I came to a horrifying realization! These CD's are exactly the same as Behind the Wheel Spanish (by the same author) only with a different name stamped on the box!!!! Buyers beware! If you own Behind the Wheel Spanish don't buy this or vice versa! Behind the wheel spanish is really good but this whole experience makes me cautious ... !"
2,Duplicate Product,"I ordered this and Behind the Wheel Spanish for my husband for Christmas. Imagine our surprise when we found out that these two items are IDENTICAL, except for the titles. Even though the prices are different! Conversational Spanish even costs more, leading you to believe the products are different. So be careful. And while the lessons are useful, the format is the same as those of taped lessons - all they did was copy the tapes to CD's, so the instructions to rewind and play the sentance again don't work. Also, there are long silences where the tapes wind to the end."
1,Don't buy this one - Book from Amazon,"The story line is incorrect. Reindeer only fly on Christmas Eve. Flying is magical so they don't need to practice flying ahead of time. If you are really knowledgeable about Santa/North Pole/Reindeer facts, you'll have a hard time explaining this story to children."
1,[aweful],"This is probably the most ill-formed book in general I have ever read, not to mention the worst grow book, period. The illustrations are CHEESY.The photographs are of poor quality, you can barely discern them. The information is general, contradictory, unorganized... I wouln't trust a thing in it, which is strange because Jorge Cervantes is a genius, and his previous publications prove his skill. But this book is a no-no. Go for another, and don't be afraid to spend the bucks. You want climate matched with plant variety with specific feeding instructions, and plenty of do's and dont's. If your info is poor then your fruit will suffer."
4,Cheap Adapter Does the Job,"I was sceptical of the Opteka .5x wide angle lens adapter because of the low price. At $79.95 it was hundreds less than other brand name models. I was shooting a low budget documentary in HDV and needed something to shoot subjects in a car. It was only a couple of scenes so I took a chance.The picture quality is good - clean not fuzzy - and the warping at the edges is minimal. It's a two piece unit that screws together and it is heavy but it works. The only thing about adding that much glass is you get more speculars, particularly outdoors on a sunny day. Maybe the more expensive ones have a way to reduce this effect, I don't know. For the money, this lens worked just fine."
4,Hope for my fatty liver,"When told I had a fatty liver I was surprised because I've been taking pretty good care of it. But when I saw Silymarin Milk Thistle and learned of it healthful properties I was intrigued. Hoping the product cleanses and support my big fat liver, I will continue to take it with trust in my heart that it's doing the trick."
4,Business Case History of the Evolution of E-Commerce,"""~The first real Extranet was built by Federal Express. GE built the first major B2B E-Business site. The principle advantage each site found was a major service enhancement to each of its customers and a major disintermediation of cost for themselves. this is not a technical how to book, but it is a good read to help senior management understand some of the key service examples others have developed in delivering their company a successful e-Business solution. than how to do it."
2,Base knowledge for the casual reader,I tried to use this as a source for a research paper and almost threw it in the trash. I certainly can't imagine using it to actually construct an extranet. Don't waste your time.
5,super fly trap,When I got the trap home I didn't know you should not cut the bag so I screwed it up and it would not hold water so I cut the bag off and stuck the cone in a plastic container I had. I had to cut the plastic lid to squeeze it in. I baited the trap and the results have been amazing. I estimate I am catching 200 to 300 flies a day. Quite a bargain for the price. I plan to buy two more. When the bag is full remove the plastic top and stick it in a plastic container which works just as good as the bag.
1,Dreadful,"Bought this item based on the positive reviews. I bought 3 and followed the directions. Not only did this trap not catch any flies, the smell was dreadful. At first we thought we had a dead mouse in the wall. The smell is that bad. We threw them out. This trap was a waste of money and time."
1,doesn't work.,"simply doesn't work. no flies are attracted to it. And even if they were, the holes are too small for the flies to enter the trap!!"
5,Fly's,"Smells a little but this Really works, 20,000 flies YES! I've never seen such a draw for thousands of flies. I 'm ordering at least six more units. Don't reuse I spilled it and had to shower!"
5,Updated Review,"I'm updating my last review where I said it didn't work. I've since moved it to a new location and this trap collect hundreds of flies. I can really see a difference when I got outside now.I would also like to add that I didn't take this down during hurricane sandy and it held up to the really bad rain, and very high wind pretty well! I thought it was gonna be all ripped apart when I went out there to look at it. The winds reached at least 90MPH. So don't worry if you get a bad storm. As long as you have it tied up good it should stay."
3,Works as advertised,This product does catch the flys but i'm not sure if it doesn't attract more in the process. WoW does it stink
4,don't hang around dogs!,"Didn't have this item long enough to see how well it worked- My German Shepard got a whiff of it, jumped up (I had it hanging about 5.5 feet off the ground), tore it down and began to devour it. She then decided to trot into the house and stink up our house. I'm sure it'll work great (I plan to order another), just know that you should hang it high enough that large dogs cannot jump up and grab it."
4,Works Great But....,"Stinks REALLY BAD!! I got this for our garage, we have less flies in the house for sure, but our garage stinks like PUKE! I'm not sure which is worse, flies or puke smell. But works great!"
2,it stinks bad,i wasnt aware that it stinks bad.use it only outdoor. it smells like rotten fish.had to throw it away cuz i wanted to use something inside the house.
4,Works Great!,"Bought this and ""Rescue FTA-SF4 Reuseable Fly Trap with Attractant""After a week the Jar had about 50 flies in it.The bad, had hundreds.Only downside to the bag working so great is its pretty much already full after 2 weeks and I need a new one.Might just dish out the money for a bug zapper."
2,"Works well, but the smell is intolerable","I put one in the garage and another by the trash cans. Over 1 weeks they both collected about 20 flies each, but the smell was so bad I had to remove them from any where around the house, I now have them in the back of the yard where they continue to work, but the flys are still getting in the house... too bad!"
2,"Works well, but smells awful.","Make sure you keep this away from a house. It stank up my yard pretty badly, and I ended up throwing this thing away after a couple of days."
3,Works too well - would not recommend for urban settings.,"This thing works great, but not for me. I have chickens and on any given day have about 20 flies around their coop. I bought this to try and eradicate them. Instead, it attracted every fly within a four block radius. It filled up in about a week with what must have been several hundred flies, all-the-while there were still at least 10 flies flying around the coop at any given time, thus not really solving my problem at all.I live in a city. Maybe it work better in a rural setting where you can isolate the problem better.On a side note, when the dead flies start to rot in the bag, it will let off the worst smell you will ever smell. Discard often and with extreme care. God help the guy who spills this thing full of dead, rotting flies."
1,"Works, but Attracts way more than it kills","This thing kills flies like nobody's business. I was very excited about it for the first day.We kept swapping it out for a new one, & it kept filling up....but we noticed that the moment we put one up, there were WAY more flies.I think it must be the potent smell, but it attracts all the neighboring fliesWe wanted it for our back porch near the trash cans. I would frequently go out there and swat flies, and would count how many I swatted. When there were a lot of flies, I'd swat 40 or 50 in a single setting.Once we hung this up, I would go out there and swat 200 - 500 flies in a single setting.So it does kill flies, but it isn't worth it because it attracts thousands more than you already have."
1,smells like horse dung,"I am guessing the 'attractant' used in these traps is derived from poop.WORD TO THE SQUEAMISH- this bag will be FULL OF FLIES, and the whole thing will be pulsing from the dying wing-beats of the hundreds (thousands?) of flies inside the bag. It is NOT for the faint of heart.YUCK. It's giving me the shivers just to look at the picture.Flies are gross, a clear bag full of horse poop smell and dying/dead flies is worse!Find a different solution."
1,"Caught some flies, smelled horrific",This trap kinda worked. But it smells really really bad. Not like a chemical smell. Like rotting old fish guts. Compound that with a stagnant hot summer day and it's terrible. I can smell this thing from the other end of my house and was embarrassed to use it because I know my neighbors must be able to smell it. I would not say the smells out weighed the benefit of this trap which didn't get anywhere near what customers posted for their catches.
4,Great at attracting flies,"Pros:Very good at attracting and trapping flies.Cons:A little awkward to set up. You have to cut out the top of the plastic bag which is a little tricky.The bags sometimes burst apart due to age, which can make a smelly mess.You have to use your own hanger. Hay twine works great.Overall, I've found these to work better than most other traps on the market. A good quick and cheap fly control solution."
5,These are great fly traps!,"THis is the second order of these fly traps. We tried a locally available fly trap after the first order was completely full of flies but the other brand just didn't do the job so we reordered these to use in our horse barn. These are WONDERFUL. Within minutes of hanging them, the flies started collecting. We hang them just over head level at each of the entrances to the barn and the arena and they do a superb job of ridding the barn of pesky flys that annoy our stallions."
2,Fly Traps,"I hoped this product would solve my fly problem in the backyard. I have two large dogs that are constantly bothered by the flys. I put up a Rescue fly trap and a ""old fashioned"" sticky fly paper. After about one week, I have a large number of flies stuck on the paper and only a couple trapped in the Rescue fly trap. I say save your money and buy the sticky fly paper."
3,It stinks,"This product literally stinks. I was almost killed by the smell before the flies, so I have to throw it away. The shipping and the service are good, otherwise."
1,What smell?,"This product does not work at all. I don't have a lack of flies, so that's not the problem. The problem with mine was that there was no odor omitted from the bag, hence no flies were attracted. I cut the bag open, put in a fish head and that did the trick. Filled the bag up. However, one obviously should not have to go to this sort of trouble."
1,smell is almost worse than the flys,terrible odor. you need to put it so far away that it attracts flys from where you are not at.
2,Do not use this in your house,"The trap is fine but for the love of all that is holy, do not use it in your house. The odor is just awful. It doesn't smell bad at first, but after a while, you just cannot get the smell out of your nose.I accidentally spilled this in my house and it has been stinking for weeks now.The instructions clearly state that this is to be used outdoors, but I can't figure out why you would want to trap flies outside."
4,"Works great, smells bad, attracts too many flies","I have been using these traps for a few seasons now and they work really well. The warmer the weather, the better they work. The problem is with the smell. The smell like rotten meat and thats what attracts the flies.It is recommended that you add water to them to keep the trap active so that they last longer and that extends the life of the trap. Still the smell is horrible. We recently moved to a home with a small yard and found that the traps are actually causing a bigger fly problem than they are solving. While they are filling up quickly, they are attracting more flies than can get into the trap and thus our yard is covered with the insects.I gave the traps a four star rating because they are very good, but very stinky and not really good for small yards really hot temps, 100+."
3,Be careful if you have pets!,I bought one of these and hung it on a poll w/a hook about 4 feet up in the air. It does kill flys but... My cats spotted the flys inside the bag and jumped up and bit (they are clawless in front)the bag trying to get to the flys. They eventually bit through the bag while we were out. Luckily I saw the bag was leaking shortly after this happened and the cats were O.K. but this could be a concern. Hang 'em high!
5,Fantastic Fly Trap!,"My little dog and I were getting attacked by flies every time we sat in our front yard. We purchased this trap, hung it from the tree,and within days the trap was full of flies. We have been able to sit outside relax and enjoy ourselves without being bothered by flies. Can not tell you how nice it is to be fly free!!! Great trap!!!"
4,Works,"Purchase my trap from Walmart because I was sick of nasty flies biting my dogs. I placed the trap in a spot close by my dogs to lure them away......it catches about 60 flies a day. My trap is in partial shade but when the sun shines directly on it, those flies go crazy."
5,Traps lots of flies,"At first I thought this wasn't working. After about 3 days, the flys started to accumulate. After a couple weeks, the back was completely full of flies, and they aren't buzzing around my head anymore. The smell is quite noticeable, though. You'll definitely want to keep this away from doors and windows."
5,Works great!,I have never seen a product work this good. I ordered two and hung one in the front yard and one in the back. It took a couple days after hanging it up for it to start working. All of a sudden it was filled with hundreds of flies! It really helps in keeping the flies from coming in my house. I am ordering two more. One as an extra in the front yard and one for my horse stalls. Awesome product!I must say that you better read the directions carefully about placement because it smells really really bad. I almost got sick just hanging it in the tree. But it is well worth holding your nose a couple minutes to install it because this really works well. I highly recommend these.
5,EXCELLENT!!,After moving in with our horses to previous cow property we fought the flies and the flies won!I tried several different items yet found this trap to be the absolute best! Hae recommended it to others and they love it too.Think I have caught a billion flies with it over the past 7 years and it is priceless.
5,Fly Genocide!,"Extremely effective. Very pleased with this product. Living in an older home in San Diego where few homes have air conditioning, we keep our windows open for ventilation. Unfortunately this lets all sorts of pests inside, mainly annoying flies. Plus, our neighbors have three dogs, which I think are attracting the flies to our area. Last weekend I discovered the Rescue trap at Home Depot. I was skeptical, but I bought it and started to set it up on the fence bordering the neighbors. To my amazement, it caught two flies before I had even finished hanging it! In an hour it was swarming with flies helplessly trapped inside the bag. In another hour when the sun began to shine on it and warm up the liquid, there were hundreds of flies inside. It was fly genocide!24 hours later and the population has been reduced significantly. There are no flies in the house. Amazing."
3,It works! And smells Terrible!,"We used this out in our patio to help capture flies that annoy us during summer barbecue dinners.It is very, very effective and attracting and trapping flies. It was full of ~100 flies after a few weeks.But it really smells terrible.The last one I got, when I was moving, it slipped, and broke all over the patio and now it smells like fly catcher...So I think we're going to be trying another solution now..."
2,Stinks soooo bad!,"It may do what it needs to do, but, it stinks so bad while doing it. I cannot tell you just how awful. We have a large patio and we were seriously thinking something had DIED on our porch. Which, I guess something did--but it was beyond belief. We had it hung for no more than 2 days before we removed it due to the rank nature of it. While it may do what it needs to do does not matter when it stinks so bad we had to remove it.I got input from a neighbor who had the same experience.Guess we will try something else... or just use a fly swatter."
2,for OUTDOOR use,"I didn't see anywhere in the description that this fly trap is intended for outdoor use. So I was confused when 4 days after hanging it my whole house smelled like a garbage dump.Make sure you hang this fly trap outside - unfortunately, that is not where I had a fly problem."
3,"Actually attracted a vulture, but NO DEERFLIES","Stinks like mixture of cow and dog doodoo. But it does work! Each week added about 1-1/2"" layer of dead flies. In less than a month the whole thing was full and had the most vulgar odor even 50feet away. When throwing it away I had to use my large Channel Locks to carry it to the garbage bag and quickly close it up. I recommend keeping the windows of your house closed if it is anywhere nearby. The main reason I bought this was to see if it worked on deerfly and horsefly. But it did NOT work for biting flies, at all! Just the green and regular black house flies. Last weekend when it was almost full and fresh new swarm of flies were trapped inside trying to get out, a vulture actually flew around trying to figure out what those flies were getting into! My father said it was a turkey vulture."
4,Everyone wants to get into the disco!,"Considering what I have noted from other reviewers, our fly problem (caused by our dog's waste) isn't that bad. However, on day 2 of leaving the bag out, hundreds of flies starting scrambling to get in! There a party in the bag and everyone wants in!Although, this product did not seem to attract regular houseflies, only the larger species (Blue Bottle, I think) could not resist the bait. I don't even know where they were coming from because there must be about a 500 flies in the bag after 5 days.We would have liked it to attract the regular houseflies but overall, we are happy with this product and will order more."
2,Disposable Fly Trap,I was disappoint to read that this product is designed for use outside or in well ventilated area. I have an indoor fly infestation and would hesitate using it indoors because of the foul smell. It was not clearly spelled out in the advertising or I would never have bought this product.
2,Didn't really seeme to catch many flies,"I normally use trap n toss traps but decided to try and spend less money last summer, bad mistake.Thses traps came together fine, but I put 2 out. One on the horse corral and one by the manure dumpster. Only the one by the horse caught anything and i think it might have been because after a few flies died the smell attracted more. The one by the dumpster may have had 1 floating in it when I finally tossed it.Oh well, I ordered a ton so I'll put them out again this summer but im not expecting much."
4,Fly Traos,"I found the Fly Traps to be very effective, however if the bag was a little bigger, then I would have said it was a perfect product."
5,Fantastic for chicken coop,We have had a fly problem in our chicken coop and this has worked fabulously for getting rid of flies - after only 2 days there are probably 40 flies in it! Will be hanging the second one next to the dog poop garbage can! Great product.
5,Fantastic,The best fly trap available. I had an enormous fly problem in my back yard and tried EVERYTHING available to get rid of them. This is the first product that has ever worked completely. Highly recommend to everyone looking for fly relief!
3,Ironworking Tool,Its a good tool. My last one the steel seems soft.I think they grow legs. lol they are very handy.
3,Not acceptable for college-level class.,"This book is a great topic and a very readable translation of a great work, but if you need this title for a philosophy class, this one doesn't have the reference numbers/letters in the margins, expected in a book for participating in a class reading. This translation uses more contemporary language and doesn't match the teacher's version. I searched for this book by ISBN number and thought it was the same book."
3,And It Was A Dream,"To explain my title for this review...I recently completed reading this for a colllege class...and recently had a dream based on this book...except I was the one who was on trail and I had to drink the poison in a glass dome with someone else under a night sky.I guess the book effected me...and I hope I just caught your interest. Anyone who says this book is hard to understand...I beg to differ. It was very easy to understand...in fact I forgot it was written so many years ago.I completed large amounts of the story in one sitting...and could have read the book in a day or two...if I wanted to. Except I didn't want to, and ended up cramming my reading in the days before class.Why? Well there is a lot of repeating here. A lot of saying something and saying it again and again for sometimes two or three pages at a time. It got a bit dull. The underlying theme of absolutes was what I came away with."
3,Great book for the end of Scorates but a little boring at the end.,I know this is something that has been written many years ago but at the end it gets a bit repetative on the discussion of death and the soul.
4,not the easiest to read,"although this was not the easiest book to read, it was still very interesting. Don't buy book s written (originally) by plato socrates aristotle or any other philosopher for that matter if you are looking for something easy to read and follow."
5,Do yourself a favor and get this CD!,"This CD is well worth the affordable price if only for the fact that the 14 track CD comes with a fully packed DVD! But there's a bonus! This CD is the best of 2002! Ash are an extremely talented band and have been turning out rockin music for almost ten years. When I bought this CD I realized that this was their best album to date! Burn Baby Burn is the single that will hook you in, but once you start listening you realize all 14 songs are killer. If you like guitar-driven rock with a poppy catch, GET THIS CD!"
4,Powerful pop!,"There are some excellent tunes here and a couple of really good rockers but for the most part the cd is very good pop.The bonus cd is kind of cool to see the videos and some tapes of live prformances however I find the production on the cd lacking, the sound quality should have been better. At the excellent price of this cd and dvd perhaps the dollars should have been concentrated on the cd. Still, it is a good listen. If you are looking for something with more of an edge and better IMHO buy the Vines new release ""Highly Evolved"""
4,Charming Dark Pop,"Irish punk group Ash veer ever closer to dark pop on their expert fourth CD Free All Angels. Though they still have a wildly beating thrash-heart (check out ""Burn Baby Burn"" and ""World Domination""), they're no longer frightened of their gentler, lyrical side. The highlights here, as on their last two releases, are mid-tempo charmers such as ""Someday"", ""Shining Light,"" and ""Candy"" - tracks which are bright both musically and textually. In root music that usually subverts negative worldview through the forward propulsion of its rhythms, it's reassuring to hear frontman Tim Wheeler implore an ex-girlfriend that ""it's all right to be alone"", then back up his claim without sounding like either a delusional cad or an outright a-hole."
2,First 3 songs good then...a little disapoointing,"When I head ""Shining Light"" I thought this was going to be real find. When I bought this CD, I was let down a little. The first things (including Shining Light) are very catchy and good. But, from then on, the CD just goes into gradual mediocrity. Oh well, I guess I still think Shining Light is a great song with great words."
5,TIM WHEELER THE GENIUS,"Ash are much better than The Beatles ever were.The Beatles were so overrated.Tim Wheeler is much better than John Lennon or Paul Mc Cartney,f**k Lennon and Mc Cartney,they produced s**t and were so overrated and Ash are a great band.Ash's songs,not s**t like The Beatles,so C'mon everybody,see that The ol' Beatles were no good and weren't the best band ever.Ash are now the greatest band around,ain't they?You've gotta admit they are."
5,World Domination?,"Finally, Ash's fourth album, 'Free All Angels,' is released in the states and it is brilliant. I have been a fan since their first release, 1995's 'Trailer.' Though 'Free All Angels' is not as amazing as Ash's second album, '1977,' it is definitely worth picking up. ""There's a Star,"" ""Sometimes,"" and ""Shining Light"" are stellar tracks. The bonus DVD is features videos, two live clips (from the import-only 'Tokyo Blitz'), and a very cute documentary that shows the band's popularity through-out the globe. Perhaps someday, they will crack The States."
5,"Even without the DVD, this is a must have CD!","This is the third time I have purchased this CD. First when it came out in England, then when the bonus CD was released with the Special European Tour Edition, and now that it is released with a bonus DVD. This is by far the best version of all three. Of course, the music on the CD has already proven itself to be one of the best CDs available for a long time with its string of hits. This is Ash at their best! Despite it being released a year ago, it is still in my CD player daily. In my view, this is the perfect summertime album. Well worth the money on its own. The DVD is filled with goodies from bonus tracks to samples from their Tokyo Blitz DVD and some features on the band. This is definitely the most extensive bonus DVD I have ever seen. And it's not boring bonus material like so many bands release for free. (eminem, cough, cough.) Quite a steal to get this free with the CD. But I heard it won't be available for long so go buy it now!"
5,Love these large wipes,"I really love these large wipes. I always carry the standard size but after finding these I noticed that I now use 1 of the ""Big Ones"" instead of 4 or 5 regular sized ones to do the same job. They are also a little thicker then the regular ones, so they will do more work for you. Great to have on the road."
2,service needs help,"i purchased ""The Total Blender"" back in 2006. i just started using it and it has about 60-70 uses on the odometer. the blades have already seized and started smoking. then it leaked. called the company for service today and they said that i needed to buy another container. i think they should have at least looked at my machine; it looks BRAND NEW and yet it won't work? i think i got a bum one from the factory and didn't notice it until i moved into my professional/home kitchen and started to use it ... which is what i bought it for.because of the service, i think i'm selling the motor unit and jumping ship to the longer warrantied vitamix. it seems that company actually stands by their product. sorry blentec. you won me on the will it blend, but lost me because you actually won't blend for me. (unless i pay another $100 for a blade and container.)"
5,Great Book!,This is an inspiring book! I was reading it on google books and decided I needed to have it in hard copy.
1,I can't stand it!,I had to read this for a history class. It jumped around so much to different time periods that I kept loosing my place. I ended up having to reread parts several times and then I still couldn't even finish the book. I ended up just giving up.
1,Zzzzzzzzzz....,You have to be insane to like this book... wait... You have to be insane to even READ this book.
5,And The Car Shall Be Filled With Music!,"And the night shall be filled with music,And the cares that infest the dayShall fold their tents like the ArabsAnd as silently steal away.~Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, The Day Is DoneI've played no other CD in my car since this one arrived some time ago. I play it loudly and the cars that infest the highway fold away.Truly sublime music!"
4,Unsatisfying Ending to A Good Series,"Well, this just wasn't much of a conclusion. There were so many things left unanswered and dangling. I mean, it was an exciting read, but the end was just too abrupt for me. I didn't love this one, and all in all, I liked the first half better (the Corwin books). But, the series overall was very unique and entertaining."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This is the final volume in Roger Zelazny's Amber series.Merlin discovers he is a pawn in the game between the powers of Amber and Chaos, and is not too happy. It is all he can do to stay alive, however. The culmination of all the crazy, devious and violent power struggles in Amber and Chaos."
2,Last and least,"At the end of ""Knight of Shadows"", the series had a lot of open threads (the wheel ring, Julia, Jurt etc). Unfortunately, Mr. Zelazny chose the quick and easy way to solve it, and in a miraculous way all ends well. The superb plot and storyline of the first nine parts are not continued in this part, and the only reason for buying it, is that the Amber series is not complete without it. Alas."
3,Dissapointed with the final tape in this series.,"I have had this tape on order for months, and I was quite excited when it arrived. That excitement dwindled when I poped in the tape and found that it was not Roger Zelazny who read this story, as the printed cover stated. The story is still good, but the 'flavor' that was built up by Roger's interpretations of his characters was spoiled for me.Worth the listening, but not worth getting excited over."
5,My favorite series of all time!,"I love this series and was very saddened when Mr. Zelazny died before finishing it. The first series with Corwin as the central character was excellent, but I do prefer the latter half with his son Merlin. This book was good but it is a bit glum as a stand a lone book as it was intended to further the storyline for more to come. I started reading this series when I was 7 or 8, it is a great first sci-fi series for young readers and a still holds up when I reread them as an adult. Zelazny's world is well thought out and complete with no annoying continuity errors as is in many other series of this kind. It helps to keep you submerged in the magical world without having to worry about being distracted by errors and logistical problems. I definitely highly recommend this as a great, fun, series."
2,"omega planet ocean, foged up","Fogged up after 3 months.Dont buy one unless your never going to get it wet.Warrenty void if water damage, even though its supposed to be a pro divers watch."
4,Great Book for Intermediates,"I found this book very helpful. It's extremely well written and has superb sample code. It covers the servlet API and JSP. The tips on debugging were very insightful. There's a chapter on java and XML which is well done. Brogden also covers EJBs and shows you how to create your own custom JSP tag library. Overall, a high quality, objective book on building web apps with Java, that is not biased toward a particular tool or server. The Appendix serves as a nice reference to the core classes in the JSP and Servlet API. This is the 2nd java book by Brogden that I highly recommend. The other is Java 2 Exam Prep."
5,Must have!!,"This is a must have for planted aquariums. I have a 45 gallon and used two bags of this as my top layer and I haven't had to use any supplements for my plants. As other people may have stated, you absolutely need to rinse this stuff before using it. Don't worry, you won't rinse away all the nutrients! I probably rinsed one bag about 15 times and my tank was still a little cloudy for at least 4 or 5 days. You can add finer gravel on top if you prefer."
3,Historically insightful,"""Each advance in natural knowledge teaches us that it is the pleasure of the Creator to govern the world by the laws which he has imposed, and which are not in our times interrupted or suspended."" ~~ Walter ScottThe author of this work does not believe in witchcraft and believes, instead, that the persecution of witches was in and of it self evil and a great miscarriage of justice. The book is a worthwhile read to put the witch trials into a form of perspective."
5,Great reference! Lots of illustrations!,"I have a job with a lot of ""reading time"", so I bring books to work. This book was GREAT for studying at work - the illustrations helped me grasp new concepts and techniques about Photoshop, without having my computer in front of me! The book is lavishly illustrated (hence the ""visually"" in the title) and this is a great learning aid. A lot of the information stuck in my brain because I could see a visual reference in the book. It's also a good book to just thumb through, and find out how to use a new technique.I wouldn't want to rely on it as my *only* Photoshop book, but I found it to be a great study aid. I intend to get the Photoshop 6 edition, since I have recently upgraded my software. The only downside to this book is that all the screenshots are of Windows! Since I use my Mac for most Photoshop work, I wasn't crazy about all the Windows screenshots - but I survived! ;-)"
3,A Solid Effort!,"Brian H. Breuel gives detailed advice about estate planning, business succession, investing, and long-term care. He argues that many wealth-eroding pitfalls can be avoided with diligent planning and professional advice. He covers common problems, including dying without a will, outdated wills, and business succession. Keeping your business's value in your family's hands requires planning well in advance of your retirement or death. The well-organized advice here is detailed enough to be useful to sophisticated readers. We [...] recommend this book to anyone looking for detailed guidance about estate planning and business succession. [[...] note: The legal matters covered are based entirely on U.S. law.]"
1,Are You Kidding?,"I have read dozens of books in this genre. This is the worst. This book is more likley to erode wealth than protect it. Poorly organized, lots of bad advice."
4,Good Undies,"Very happy with the fit, feel, look of these pouch briefs.For those guys out there who like pouch briefs I recommend."
5,Every day can be a hot summer night at Temptations,"If you are a club goer from the tri-state area, Denny Tsettos is a household name to you. For those who aren't, Denny is a reknowned DJ, remixer and producer who has been packing the dancefloors in the tri-state area for years and equally kicking out some of the dancefloors biggest remixes. This CD captures the essence of a hot summer night down at the New Jersey shore club Temptations. The cd is full of Tsettos' signture style, banging beats with spices of vocals. Don't think this is any other mix cd with beats for over a n hour and once its done all you have to show for it is a splitting headache, because this cd is not that. Denny keeps you moving from beginning to end. For all NY'ers, on those cold snowy January Saturday nights when you are stuck home because of a snowstorm and its 3 degrees out, pop on this cd and it will be a 95 degree hot August Saturday night!!!"
5,One of the funniest movies ever,"If you like comedy and are a member of genX or any other for that matter you cannot go without seeing this movie. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey take the skit on SNL to new heights. Its one of my fav movies and i highly reccomend it. ""Hi im in Deleware""~Wayne (Mike Myers)"
3,Wayne's World,This is not MY favorite movie but my sons like it & I am slowly upgrading all their old VHS movies to DVD & Blue Ray. The DVD arrived quickly & in time for the holidays & it was a new/unused copy in great condition.
3,"Hey, Even An Old Geezer Can Laugh At This","As an older guy watching something geared more for a younger crowd, I would sit and watch this almost shaking my head in disbelief that I WAS watching this....and usually having a good time. It's brainless, but fun, like Mike Myers' stupid grin.The humor is really stupid, silly, crude at times, innocent at times but funny many times. All that adds up to is an an hour-and-a-half of entertainment, so at least it succeeds in what it's trying to accomplish. So, even if it is far from a classy comedy, so what? How many are these days?I can't knock something - even if this dumb - that makes me laugh. Apparently a lot of people agreed as it produced a sequel."
5,SHAWING,This is Mike Myers' best movie. I enjoyed this movie more than the sequel and both Austin Powers movies. Dana Carvey is also very hilarious in it. I would give it 10 stars if it were possible! BUY IT NOW!!!!!!
3,Watchable brainless movie,"OK way to pass some time...a few laughs, but nothing great. It's hard to stretch a comedy sketch into a whole movie."
4,Schwing!,"If you've never seen this movie, you're missing out on quintessential 90s culture. Has Meatloaf, briefly, Alice Cooper (""We're not worthy!""), Tia Carrere, Rob Lowe (I love his ""straight man"" in comedies), Chris Farley, and many more. Mike Myers was way funny (sorry, Mike, get away from Austin Powers and the spoofs - I just think you're a lot funnier than those films!), before Dana Carvey had heart problems, and when the late 80s cast of SNL was still around! This movie rocks!"
4,Great Movie,"This movie seems to be completely pointless...but I love it! Granted, it drags in places, but the parts that are meant to be funny really are. I will never forget the ""Foxy Lady"" scene...this movie is classic!"
5,Lost but not forgotten,My kids will now be able to see this classic music that involves great music...
5,"wayne's world, wayne's world, it's party time, exellent!","what can I say..... wait I tcan say alot.my name is Andrew ross, and I love SNL, and all comedy type stuff, I even am going to try and get on SNL when I am older.well this movie is great.the story is that wayne's world keeps on getting more and more popular so they get on cable but things start to not be what they seem.this is so funny I mean not (joking) that is a line from the movie. well if you liked it on sln you will like it on this.I know that was short but I gust got back from a 5 hour trip.....while watching this movie on the way back.now buy it or you are a sphincter boy."
3,Cha!,"""Party on Wayne, party on Garth! Extreme close-up! Waaaahhh!"" Typical dialogue from the popular basement television show, ""Wayne's World."" If you can get by that, you're worthy. Noah's Arcade wants a teen-oriented tv show that will attract more gamers to his arcades. Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) are dreamers and they live it up. Singing Queen and ""Stairway to Heaven"" denied, they get their show back to the way they had it before, in their garage. So, party on idiot! Party on moron! You might like this movie, sphincter boy says what?"
3,It`s Wayne`s world Wayne`s world party time around the world,"This movie is mostly for teenagers. I am ten and I saw it and at first, before I saw it I couldn`t wait to see it, but when I saw it, it was sort of a bummer beacuse it wasn`t how I thoght it would be. It was fuuny too, though. Most teenaged boys will get a kick out of it. My cousin did. He thought it wa sso fuuny. Er it`s ok, I guess."
3,I'd Say 3 stars.......,"Is seeing ""Wayne's World"" only once enough? It's strange that Wayne still lives with his parents at his age. In my opinion, Garth was a cooler guy. This might only be a movie for everybody else, but I have seen better. I like fantasy films. This was just a weird comedy. Most other comedies try their hardest, but are not that funny. Except ""Badder Santa""."
2,funny but stupid,"kinda funny when there are funny parts.some parts can be just way too stupid.this is not the best SNL movie.""Superstar"" is.that one was stupid but at least it was funny unlike this one"
1,AGED,"Wayne's World was funny in 1992, but now, not so much. The jokes and references are stale, and often redundant. What a shame. I thought this would be a timeless piece. I WASTED my money buying it, thinking that it would still be funny, but this has to be one of the most unfunny pieces of trash out there. DATED."
2,Pretty funny movie,"Funny movie, but this is so dumb I can just give it two stars. That doesn't mean I didn't like it, trust me I did. But it's not a serious film so... Dana Carvey is hilarious as always, where has he gone? He has so much talent. Sequel is just about the same, almost better with the help of Chris Farley."

1,Don't Buy!!,Look at the Age of Empires 3 website forum. Tons of problems. I still can't even get it to install! I guess what should I expect from Microsoft. DON'T BUY!!!
4,"Good, but not on the top","I have been a huge fan of aoe since it first came out. It was infact my first game.First off I would like to say some of the other raters have no idea what there talking about. Of course u need a gaming computer to play a pc game. And there will always be fantasy in games, its not education.At first i thought this game was pretty bad, but if u stick in for a few more hours of play it gets better. This is also the only game set in this time period. The graphics are good and game play is pretty good to. I liked the idea of shipments of goods and troops. The naval battles are also pretty good, and the size realisim has increased. I would say the game is well worth the money."
1,"Buggy, Buggy, Buggy! Unplayable at release.","I could only give this game 1 star as I've still not been able to play it for more than 10 minutes without it locking up, crashing, losing sound or mouse controls. After owning it for a month, I have yet to finish and scenario or skirmish because it's simply unplayable as it is right now. If you read the Microsoft AoE3 forums, you can get more information. The game was poorly tested and nearly everyone is having issues. A patch is expected sometime (no word for ES on when though) so I would strongly suggest waiting to purchase this game to save yourself frustration and disappointment. It does look promising, as long as they can fix all the bugs."
4,the greatest tarzan yet,this third installment in the tarzan series does not in the least dissapoint. the new characters plot and setting make this book a must read for tarzan fans.
3,Good read,"Same kinda stories as the rest, but still entertaining for a quick read. Enjoy the simplicity of these books to relax."
5,I really enjoyed this series,i really enjoyed this series. I had a problem at first getting the order of the books. so I bought an Omnibus. I was much happier having it all in one file on my kindle.
4,Lots of fun,Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote several books this being one of them about the life and time of Tarzan he is a good writer and can keep your interest. The plots are simple but just fun to read after a long day.
3,Slightly less good than the first two,"The first two Tarzan novels were filled with action, adventure, and excitement. The third book,the beasts of Tarzan is much less exciting, as the plot is very repetitive.This time around, tarzan learns that his son has been kidnpped by an old enemy. Tarzan tries to rescue his son but ends up stranded on an island.Possibly the worst parts of the book were the ones that focused on Jane, since she can often be very dull. She, too has been taken, and she again lands on the same island ss Tarzan.While this book may not be the best in the series, I would reccomend it to anyone who is interested in the Tarzan books because it concludes the second one."
3,I guess it is an OK read,"I read it but I did not LOVE it. No offense to the author you might be a great writer and I hate to leave 3 star reviews but I would be lying to myself if I left it a 5 star. I would read it a second time again when I am less busy, maybe I would review it again!"
4,Decent Exam Prep.,"This is actually a farily good exam prep- there are a few errors, bu they seem to be identified well on the publishers website. I thought the book mapped pretty well to the actual exam. Obviously the more experience the better, but i do think this showed me a couple things I wasn't certain of."
2,poor choice for study,"I found this book to be very boring to read. I did not like it at all. Its content left little to be desired also. I disliked it so much, I returned it for a refund. I suggest Microsoft's own ""Desktop Applications for Microsoft VC++ 6.0: MCSD Training Kit."" it is a much better read."
1,Do'nt Buy It !,"I bought this book in order to pass the exam 70-016. First it seems to be very good, But after I did the exam I realize that the book deals only with basic. esp. the covering of the COM(there was'nt any description of the interfaces of COM). Do'nt spend money on it !"
5,Revelation MacArthur Study,This is a really good study. I like that the scripture text is right there in the lesson. Very good study helps.
3,Publish Date,"The copy I received was last printed in 2001. This book has since been revised and reprinted so my copy does not match up with the others in my class, so it is difficult to follow question discussions. It would have been nice to know the publication date."
5,Excellent Study of The Revelation,"Our study group is finding MacArthur's study thorough, well arranged and full of useful commentary. The questions are well written to provoke in-depth discussion."
4,"This review is for the bonus disk ONLY, not the DVD!!","I have not seen the DVD yet (although I'm sure its good). However I do have the bonus disk. Being a newcomer to Rouse, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. This is in two words, ""laid back"". Something you would put on while driving along on a summer day with sandy beaches on one side and your hot girlfriend sleeping in the passenger seat next to you. This is the type of feeling Rouse's album evokes, and his ability to craft well-written tunes in the vein of talented singer/songwriter's like Paul Simon, Cat Stevens, etc is top notch. Highly recommended."
