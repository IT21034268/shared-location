2,Bible,"I received this product on time. WhenI got it, I did not like the shape it was in. You should never sell books, especially a Bible that has stains on the pages. It looks like someone spilled something all over it. Outside looks good but not inside."
3,"Lovely edition, but binding is inferior.","This is one of my favorite bibles. The mother's devotionals are thought provoking and help to bring the scripture into my everyday life. However, I have the paperback version and the binding fell apart rather quickly. I carry my bible with me and this book didn't hold up to every day use."
4,Perfect for busy young mothers,"I ordered this Bible for a friend having trouble keeping up with her older boy, and her infant son. We've shared devotionals before, but nothing as pointed and helpful as the entries in this particular book. I recommend it as daily reading for any mother."
4,Jersey Garden Glove With Dots,"These are really nice looking gloves. In fact, when my husband saw them, he said they looked too nice to use for gardening. They fit very comfortably. I think they are just wonderful and at this price, they can't be beat."
5,a great buy.,"this projector is one of the finest I've seen for the money. Its easy to setup and use giving a bright picture and all the adjustments are easy to understand. The owners manual is ok but unless you've been in asia a difficult manual to read and understand. For anyone looking into projectors this will make a great first projector, I like it! the freebees are great too!"
4,Works like advertised,"I added this as a second projector in our church basement. Note that there is no way to adjust the picture size other than to move the projector itself. It does work like advertised, and has a good picture, (you may need to darken the room if you are going to use it in the daytime) and even has built-in speakers. I tried it first, and then opted to run plain 50 foot stereo cable with RCA type plugs, not video cable, and the picture is still very good. The direction booklet that came with it is 99% useless. (Example: When use the remoter.)The shipper could not locate my house, even though we have had hundreds, if not thousands of deliveries using the same address. The seller found out what the holdup was on the delivery, and was very helpful. All in all, I would buy another one or recommend this to anyone else - with the notes above."
3,great projector for price,"ok picture quality, good price for what it doesif the picture gets over about 106 inches then the resolution is to low to watch properly (it looks to pixelated)"
1,Stops working quickly,"Well, I really hate to change my review. I posted a stellar review after one week of use. It was a great little projector for cheap! Unfortunately, the latter part caught up. Projector stopped working after a few weeks of light use. Shipped it back and received a replacement... which also stopped working after a few weeks. I thought this would be a great projector for movies and games for the family, which it would be - if it worked for longer than 2.5 weeks."
3,you get what you pay for!,This was a purchase that im happy with but not totally amazed .....this is a 720p projector its good but i would only suggest this if you just plan to use for mainly movies and tv i put in my Xbox 360 to hdmi and it was good but not amazed but it did improve my gaming experience abit i do wish it supported a higher quality ......if i can do this purchase again i would spend alittle extra for 1080p or get something DLP any questions leave a comment
1,Don't be fooled by price,"Bought this projector thinking it was a bargain but it turned out to be a big bust. It is huge and bulky. It has no warrantee. If you open the packaging in any way, you are stuck with it and can't return it. The machine gives off massive heat. It's resolution/pic quality reminds you of a tv monitor from the 90's. The manufacturer greased the lens so that when you try to focus the image, you get grease on your hands. Next time I will buy a name brand. I have yet to figure out the name of the company that made this projector as it is not on the machine at all. The instructions are actually written in broken English. The projector now sits unused in my house. It was a bad investment of my money."
3,"Worth the price, but isn't great","Had this projector for about a year now, so I've had plenty of time to mess around with it.The picture quality is subpar when compared to most modern tvs and the refresh rate seems pretty low. I still prefer to watch movies on my other tvs and only really use this to play PS3 and Wii games on.Even with the less than ideal picture, it's a great value and well worth the price. My son and I enjoy playing games on it especially since we play alot of split screen games and even with the screen split we can still easily see our sections of the screen due to our overall screen size being around 100 inches.As others have said, the fan in this unit is REALLY loud. I'm wondering if you can replace it with something else, since it appears to be the same size/type as the fans you would find in a computer. Also, the lack of a zoom function means you need to move the unit closer/further away from your screen to change the size. This limits your mounting/install options."
2,Awful 'type tracker' section,"While there are a lot of very nice case studies in this book, and the notes on colour usage are probably worth the cover price, the type tracker section is just plain wrong. True it's only a sixteen page section in a 356 page book, but as any designer will tell you 'it's all in the details...'The publishers blurb states 'The type section... focuses on the various fonts that have been popular over the decades. This feature offers readers the ability to use accurate historical design treatments in their work for appropriate projects.'I disagree with this statement, I disagree with Cheryl Dangel Cullens' analyses of the 'period' fonts reproduced on these pages and above all I would urge readers to find better historical type reference elsewhere."
2,Trash,"Let me start off by saying that the BoDeans are one of my Top 5 favorite bands of all time. Joe Dirt Car was my introduction to the BoDeans and I was immediately hooked. I've seen them live at the Basilica Block Party in Minneapolis and they rocked the house.First off, why would they even put out this album? Most of the songs (12 of 18?) are already on Joe Dirt Car (a previous live album). Second, the versions of the songs on this album blow chunks. The tempo/BPM of the songs is WAY WAY to fast. It sounds like the are rushing to get through the songs. Plus, the songs are uninspired and devoid of emotion.Even though I love the BoDeans, I hated the songs on the first (of two) albums that I almost hit the skip button on the media player. The only song worth a listen on this double album is Fadeaway. They did a GREAT job on that one.Don't waste your time on this one."
5,Thanks for the nice reviews!,"Hi, as one of the actors in this small film, I really appreciate the kind words about it. The screenplay by Beth Henley was very funny, infact, in it's original form, the script was a laugh riot. Somehow, either by cost cutting or by director and editing cuts the film was whittled down to a quirky romance, with a lot of the comedy missing. It's still a sweet and funny film. So buy it or rent it, but if you like quirky characters, you'll like this film. -Dean Ricca"
4,A sleepy hit with romance and emotion,"I really liked the fact that mousy Arquette got rid of her shell. Roberts was interesting as a romantic lead. Not much to this movie really, but will leave viewer feeling glad to have experienced love."
3,It could have been better,"Eric Roberts was really good in this movie,unfortunatly the same can't be said about Rosanna Arquette.I didn't like her character much but Eric roberts and her had good chemistry.It also had some memorable lines,like ""He just looks at me,stares at me,with these eyes"" wich she brings up again later in the movie and I can see why.Eric Roberts has some peircing eyes that will leave any woman hypnotized.It's a shame.This movie had alot more potential.I say it's worth a rental but not a buy."
3,Not the greatest Beth Henley,"To see Henley at her best, check out Miss Firecracker & Crimes of the Heart."
3,Still Waiting,"Mint Condition, hearing a whisper of the name usually makes me spin around hoping I can catch a glimmer of anything written and performed by the talented band. That's why I was really disappointed after listening to Life's Aquarium. No, it was not a bad album. Actually, it was good. However, good is not what I have come to expect from this group. With the exception of the first release, ""If you Love Me"", the CD fell short of this fan's expectations."
5,Life's Aquarium,Mint condition does everything so well and this CD proves to be added to their outstanding musical abilities. Don't let this one slip you by!
5,Extra Mints!!!!!!,"From the release of ""If You Love Me"",from this new CD,I knew my boys were back giving us what we expect.REAL MUSIC!!!!As always,I was not at all disappointed.MC brings us a variety of styles and songs.From the latin laced ""Spanish Eyes"" to the multi- rhythm of ""Be Like That Sometimes"",this CD is a MUST have.MC has set the standards of R&B so high, that many ""bands""fear to tread.REAL music played by REAL band members is what you expect from MC and they DELIVER. My favorite songs are ""This Day,This Minute, Right Now"" and ""Is This Pain Our Pleasure.Here's a little known fact that I'm sure only TRUE MC fan's have found out,there are 2 hidden tracks on the CD.I love the CD so much that I just let it play until it ended and to my surprise,I got some extra ""mints"". That's just like MC,giving us what we expect and something extra.Thanks MC for being true to yourselves and your fans."
3,Not very good..a let down,"We have come to expect more out of the Mint factory, but this time it didn't happen. Every recording artist will have a let down (Stevie excluded) and hopefully this will be the only one Mint has.."
2,very average,i respect Mint Condition as musicians but this is very by the numbers.i dug if you love me& pretty Lady with Charlie Wilson. Charlie Wilson is still bad after all of these years.but this disc is more by the numbers.they are capable of more and better material.
5,The Soul of R&B Lives in Mint Condition,"If you are tired of the re-heated, leftover grooves that pass for music these days, then your search for REAL funk can stop here. Mint Condition is holding up the banner of true R&B and holding down the sound of original, authentic, musicianship. The tracks on this CD are melodies as they were ment to be played--with a sincere and honest respect for music and the people who listen to it. Most songs today appeal to the feet or the fast wit. Life's Aquarium appeals to the spirit and all those who want to be blessed by the sacred sound of soul."
4,Great CD!,"This CD is one of the best I've heard in awhile especially in an age where R&B BANDS are very rare. It's probably not as good as their first one, but if you like nice beats and real LYRICS you'll like this one."
3,Where did Mint Condition go?,"A friend hooked me into Mint Condition (MC) and I have been hooked ever since. I have even hooked others on them. But, with 'Life's Aquarium', WHERE DID MC GO? I must admit I bought this album on the strength of the last two, but I expected it to be an album BY A BAND. However, 5 of the songs have programming of some sort and a couple of songs have the same rhythm and lyric feel. I never expected that from them, especially with one of the most talented drummers I've heard, Stokely. I understand he's the front man now and not the drummer. I was sorely disappointed with the entire project from a musicianship stand point. I pray they find their classic band sound - QUICKLY - and use it on their next project."
3,Okay,"I must admit that i was a little disappointed with the CD, but overall it is just okay. If you love me in my opinion is the best song on the CD, but there are a few others, like This Day, This Minute, Right Now and Tonite that sounded fine too. I guess I like their Slow Songs, didn't particularly care for the fast ones that much, which is what this CD contains."
3,Slowly succumbing to being an 'average' band.,"I saw it coming with the last CD... This sounds like any other R&B act on the radio these days. Yeah, its a band, playing instruments... but... so what, when youre losing that originality? Its not a bad CD, but they are capable of so much more.True enough, this is a music BUSINESS... and if you want to make money for your label, you have to make yourself more accessible. It just seems like they sold out, sacrificed their live band experimental sound to 'pass'. Come back to us, please."
2,"Talented musicians, disappointing recording.","Chops, chops, chops. While I've always respected M.C.s talent, I've often been let down by the quality of their music. This CD is no exception. In fact, I'd say they've taken a step backward from a songwriting perspective. ""If you love me"" hardly holds a candle to ""Pretty Brown Eyes"" or ""What kind of Man would I be"". And like their previous works, the other songs seem to be little more than filler, a band displaying great talent and potential, but lacking a certain something, a certain FIRE, that makes for a memorable music performance. Maybe they need to change their line-up, simplify the music, or just play jazz or something, but an R&B act this loaded with talent should be able to put out a better effort than this...WITHOUT SELLING OUT!"
4,Not their best but check it out anyway!,"Actually I would give it a 3 and a half stars. Its a good album overall but there are only a few cuts that are keepers. If you love me, This day this minute right now, Pretty lady with Charlie Wilson, and Touch that body were those cuts. I actually could have done without ""Leave me alone"" on the album."
2,Better than nothing,"This product is absorbant and comfortable to the touch. It cleans well. However, due to the slickness of one of the layers, it moves across the bed and bunches up under the invalid. It would be a fine product for those who move very little."
1,It Didn't Work,I should have taken heed to the person who wrote that this leaks. My daughter was lucky with this some nights but when she drank at night this couldn't help. Ultimately the mattress got bed mites and it had to be thrown out. I ended up buying a vynl matress cover that did the job.
4,Almost too moisture proof!,"I use this pad for my mother, who has Alzheimer's Disease and is bedridden. I want her skin to stay dry, which is why I tried this product. I really like this pad: the size is good, the comfort level is good, the construction is good. It does, however, keep the moisture created by my mother's body heat next to her skin rather than wick it away as advertised. I find I have to change this pad more often than regular underpads. It could be that this pad is too waterproof, ie it doesn't allow the moisture to dissipate, especially in warm weather. But I think there are situations where this kind of waterproof pad would be useful."
5,Very nice protector.,Good protector. Used for my dog who no longer needs it. Thank God for that. But it washes beautifully and dries A-ok.
2,Grandma didn't like,"Product has a plastic extension which fits around and under the mattress on one side. That's not what Grandma was looking for...she wanted the exact same brand she had last time, which does not have a plastic extension, so I had to return this and get the other."
5,Impermiable!,These pads are WONDERFUL!!! Don't hesitate to buy them! Better than pads we received in hospital.
2,Not the most attractive,"The book is readable and some covers parts of the subject, but is not satisfactorily in depth or rigorous. For instance, the Laplacian transform is skipped and Liapunov stability is poorly covered."
5,Wonderful Music!!,"What am Amazing CD! I heard about this CD from a friend. I don't generally buy CD's unless I know the artist, but I took a chance this time. I'm very happy I did because this CD has some of the nicest music I've heard in a while. The imagry is very ethereal and relaxing. Buy it!!!"
3,Hp 350C is great for travel.,The only problem that I have is trying to find the Infra Red device and the batteries that should come with it anyways. $... is a lot of money for a little printer that you have to change the ink cartrige to print color. No problems with it yet. Bob
3,Windows XP,"I bought this printer with the ""kit"" since it was the only one that actually came with a battery. The paper feeder is clumsy, especially when compared to a Canon.I ran into soem trouble installing it with Windows XP. I tried using the IR port and the HP 350 driver that came with XP (the driver on the supplied CD-ROM will NOT work with XP). It printed out as if it was a double image of everything. I called HP (after having sent one printer back for a similar problem) and after some experimentation, they suggested I tried using the HP 320 driver. That did the trick, no more problems. But, the printer is only a few days old....."
1,"Beware! They look nice, but filled with design flaws.","A year ago my company bought 300 of these printers. Since then, HP has had to replace 30% of the sheet feeders -- an obvious design flaw. Luckily they are still paying for those out of warranty. We also have had to send more than 20% of them back to HP for repair -- flashing ink cartridge light (even on fresh cartridge), won't print. HP is NOT paying for these now. Instead, they charge us [price](+ shipping) for each repair, plus downtime. We are going to try a Canon printer next. Most everything else HP makes, including the fabulous Jornada's our reps use, are good quality. But these Deskjet 350s obviously have serious design flaws. HP won't step up to the plate and help with repairs; so here is my NEGATIVE review."
2,hp deskjet 350 series cbi,this is a great product if you would start all over and redesign it it has bugs in it .it works some times right
5,What else is there for Swithblade?,"When I was 14 years old, I lived in Washington DC. I remember trying to talk Mark Wenner into letting me play drums with one of his sideline bands, the Assassins. When I look back on this, I crack up; my mother would have killed me!!!! Anyway, he was a complete nice guy, as he tried to let me down gently that it wasn't going to work out.I think the rawness of this CD adds to its charm. Also, I know of no other CD recordings of Switchblade. A lot of Nighthawks CDs I've listened to in the past sound way too cleaned up, and nothing like them live. This is raw and cool. Go Mark!"
2,not too impressed...,"Some of the songs are good, some are the same old Nighthawk routine, and some are just plain awful. Sounds like someone stood in the middle of the dancefloor at any given bar with a cheap microphone...no mixing, it seems, and just doesn't have a ""pocket""...disappointing. Have known and followed Mark and the Nighthawk boys for some time and this was just plain disappointing..."
1,BH,I was disappointed in the quality of this part. Recoil starter did not have enough tension in the spring even after winding it to its fullest tension. It kept jamming & would not retract. Visually it looked like the same part. A closer inspection showed flywheel wobbled & was unbalanced causing it to jam. Rope snapped after pulling about six times. Learned original part made in China & replacement part made in Taiwan. Maybe quality control better in China.
2,Reads like a Novel but skews like a soap-opera,"Although the book provides a good skeletal overview of Cuban HISTORY, it is done throughout with conservative speculation often leaving out evident truths leading to a view that would introduce the reader to both sides of the revolution; something strongly needed in a history of Cuba. Additionally, the great lack of revolutionary writings from Castro, Guevarra, and Cienfuegos is a strong sensor that the whole story has not been told."
1,Reminds me of a third grade history class,"Fast paced, opinionated, and an easy way of making money selling books.[...]. One cannot evaluate a country's past without considering the personal evolution of its citizens in the context of time. The present cannot be evaluated unless you live it, and this [...] future forecasts are simply an exercise in futility.Andrew J. RodriguezAuthor: ""Adios, Havana,"" a Memoir"
1,Another Distraught Cubano,This book does nothing more than give an academic look at an already easily solvable problem.Get over it the wealthy former-Cubans deserted the island and rather than sit back in their stylish Miami homes and quip and complain about what should be done they should look to their future in America or else renounce their American citizenship and go back to the Cuba.
2,nothing so far,I sowed thousand of these seeds in well prepared soil. To date I see no evidence of germination after three weeks of regular water and warm days.
4,Hank III brings country back to country music,This CD rocks! Hank sounds more like Granddaddy than Granddaddy sometimes did! I like every single cut and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because he'll need somewhere to go when he releases his next CD!
4,Grandad Would be Proud,"Big fan of Hank Sr. Have all of Wayne-The-Train's work too. Can't Stand Hank Jr., sorry. Saw Wayne at the Continental in Austin, Texas. Hank III rocks in the tradition of David Allan Coe, with some of the Rockabilly sound of The Reverend Horton Heat. Just missed The Reverend and Hank III in Vancouver - but a rockin show by the sound outside the club.Yes, Hank sounds like Wayne who sounds like Hank Sr., but so what? If you like Wayne you'll like Hank III and vice versa.Favorite track? ""If the Shoe Fits"" - which sometimes it does indeed."
4,Carrying on a Family Tradition....Hank III does it his way!,"I wasn't around when Hank Jr. lived in the shadow of his famous father by singing his songs and everyone told him, ""You ain't as good as your daddy was"", and I was only 5 when he cut the landmark album, ""Hank Williams, Jr and Friends"", which took Jr. on to success in his own right. When I first bought this album I was expecting a Hank Jr. flavored CD. Much the was Hank Jr's early albums had the same sound as Hank Sr. When I heard it I was over whelmed. The only way in which Hank III carries on the family tradition is....he also is a musician. Now we have three generation of Williams' with THREE DIFFERENT SOUNDS. This album is a must for all country music fans especially traditional country fans. Edgy yes...but wasn't Hank Sr. and Hank Jr."
3,a puppy with bite,"The first cut here, ""I Don't Know,"" sounds like it could be Jeff Foxworthy, so contrived and mannered is its self-proclaimed redneckism. The various high harmonies remind one a bit of Gram Parsons/Chris Hillman, but his true sound-alike is Jimmie Fadden, the nasal and sometimes annoying voice among the high harmonies of '70's- era Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.All of which is to say that this is Callow Country. BUT, without even listening carefully one can hear the genes of grandpappy. Not as imitation or homage, but as bred in the bone. Parts of this CD will make a Hank Williams, senior fan sob.This boy could be great. When his voice gets a little muscle and, if he decides to just sing, rather than sing ""like a badass country guy,"" we could be in for major country soul. The question is: how does a third generation Nashville royal develop as an artist? How will his talent get a chance to grow? This will take years to discover and this CD makes a most interesting first chapter."
1,Album Stinks,Hank III has done nothing but prove what a whiner he is by trashing other artists. I have not heard one song on here that suggests any artistic ability. This guy needs to clean up his mouth and worry about himself instead of trashing others.
4,carries on the torch...,"This is one of my favorite Hank III cd's besides ""Straight to hell."" This CD has quite a few good songs on it. The songs I think that stand out the most are: ""You're the reason,"" ""Lonesome for you,"" ""thunder storms and neon signs,"" his cover of Johnny Cash's ""Cocaine Blues"" I think is done really well, I'd say almost as good if not just as good as the original. And ""Why don't you leave me alone"" is a real good song with a type of ""live in a bar"" vibe to it. It is one of my favorite (country) songs that Hank III has performed. If you've heard other (country) songs by Hank III you've liked I definitely reccomend this album..."
5,GREAT ALBUM FAMILY TRADITION,I STAY REAL BUSY BUT I HAD TO TAKE TIME TO REVIEW THIS GREAT CD. HANK 3 SECOND CD AND IT'S GOT GREAT SONGS ON IT. I THANK GOD FOR FAMILY TRADITIONS. CARE ON SHELDON HURRY UP & GET A FAN CLUB.H.W.JR I WANTED TO TELL HOW GREAT YOUR SON IS.GOD BLESS WILLIAMS FAMILY
4,My Broken Heart This Mornin,"Forget titles, forget genres, forget country, forget alternative, forget Nashville, Seattle, New York, forget Shania Twain. Remember good music. Remember what your momma told you. Remember riding down that road, grit flying into your teeth. Remember lying awake at night, thinking about the woman who has your heart. Remember waking up in the morning with the taste of stale whiskey in your mouth. Remember how it felt when you had your first broken heart. When you do that, buy this CD."
3,Not for me...,This product isn't helping me learn French. It's kind of boring and repetative. I'll still be looking for another (better) product.
3,BEWARE if you want to listen to the audio on your ipod,"This is a good quality product that is a little behind the times. When you import the CD's to your itunes account, the descriptions and numbering are not consistent from CD to CD. For example on Disc 1, the tracks are numbered 0101, 0102, etc., which is great. However, on Disc 7 they are just numbered ""Track 1"" w/no indication which disc, nor is the ""author"" or ""title"" noted in the applicable columns. This makes it VERY hard to find the disc, much less the track you want to listen to for some discs. As I said, the instructional quality is superb, but you would think that with the new edition they could get a little more with the tech program! If you want to physically use the CD's in a CD player, this issue would not apply, but had I known how antiquated the uplink would be, I would not have bought it."
2,Erotica?,"This book is not primarily about African erotica.It is a collection of African stories and borrowings form early 19th Century imperialist ""anthropologist""Most of the pictures are not even of erotica but simply nude africans."
4,Enjoyable,This was a good story. I enjoyed the interaction of the main characters. The dialogue between Johanna and Drummond was more brisque than in many Scottish Highlander Romances which I prefer. I felt that the ending came too suddenly with many loose ends not tied up. It was a bit disappointing.
1,A Waste of Time,This is an author who sets up a great storyline and fails miserably because the writing is so tedious and repetitive. The denouement finally comes in the last pages and she rushes it in a few paragraphs. It is a labor to read because of the dull writing and lack of imagination. Many issues are totally unbelievable. For example we are expected to believe that a woman running a castle in her 20s does not understand the loss of virginity! Lamb adds an elephabt to the story who adds nothing to the storyline. She creates characters that are mentioned a lot and then have no real role in the storyline. Time is precious. Spend yours reading something else.
5,Great product but arrived scratched,"Weather Tech makes really nice products. I have the window and hood deflectors on my Ford F350 and thought I add a pair of the window deflectors to a 2008 Ford Ranger that I had just purchased. The nice thing about the Weather Tech window deflectors is that they come all the way down to the top of the door where all others that I'm aware of stop or end at the top of the mirror, allowing water to still enter the truck or car. The only problem was this set was scratched pretty badly. Looks like it was done before they were packaged at the manufactures. Called WeatherTech and they refered me back to Amazon. Still hasn't been resolved and it's been over a month. So I can""t say much for their customer service."
4,Check the other name too,"If you're looking for this album and Amazon is showing it out of stock, search on ""Leslie Phillips"". There are a few for sale there."
3,It was a turning,"When Leslie became Sam, when the lyrics appealed to the masses, there was a 'turning'. The same thing happened to Amy Grant of ""My Father's Eyes"", she was a seed that fell on the shallow soil, immediately sprung up, then withered in the sun. Face it, she chucked her faith. Leslie/Sam quickly distanced herself from Christianity. I don't even see it as fence straddling, but hopping over the fence and not looking back at her Christian past. Some folks are hanging onto vague allusions to Christianity, but face it- it's not there."
5,"Brilliantly written, performed and produced.","Sam (Leslie) Phillips came to the end of her rope with the evangelical Christian music scene at the same time I came to the end of mine with the whole scene entirely; you can hear pain, intelligence, growth and faith (but don't let that put you off--she won't try to save you) in every track. I know it carried me through some rough times. This album, her best to date, is truly a gem. Catch her live if you can--she's a wonderful entertainer."
5,Simply Excellent,"This was my second book in series of 5 books I picked in local library to get myself educated about Darwin. Its awesome. The book is interspread with lots of artist's own impression of Darwin, since Darwin never consider himself to be an artist, the author used his imagination to prepare this book. This is a remarkable book and Author spent a considerable time doing these wonderful illustrations. After having read all 5 books I reread this book many times overs. It takes a few minutes to finish it, but you could be spending hrs marvelling Darwin by looking at these pictures. A wonderful book which packs a lot of information in few pages."
1,"new, but it has severe water damage?????","I received this book and upon opening it I discovered the pages were stuck together, and there was SEVERE water damage. I cannot even read the book because the pages rip when you try to separate them. VERY disappointed."
2,"Great Sound, Unbelievably Uncomfortable","I bought these in the hopes that they would replace my inexpensive Philips HS500 Behind-The-Ear Headphones. The sound quality was better than the Philips but I can't wear them for more than 30 minutes at a time. I can wear the HS500's for hours on end and no discomfort.Though the sound is great, if you can't wear them, what good are they!I'll gladly stay with my HS500, which are now extremely inexpensive..."
4,Very satisfactory.,"It's true that they don't secure onto your ears, but they sit comfortably around my head. Each size in squished comfortably on each ear. Unless you have an odd or large head, you shouldn't have problems. They obviously aren't meant for hours and hours of impeccable performance, but my music sounds perfectly good through them. They're very lightweigh and with a semi-high ponytail for jogging, they don't move or shift around. Jumping, headbanging is okay with the back resting on a ponytail. But without one, the back slips down a tad."
3,not to be repetitive but...,"I purchased this CD on the strength of the live performances on Playing the Fool. Compared to Fool, the playing sounds flat and uninspired (except for some pretty cool recorder duets) though it's so technically well rehearsed that it's still amazing to think that it's live material. Additionally, there is some overlap in titles between discs one and two, and the versions add little to each other. I was greatly disappointed.A mediocre set, and I would recommend picking up Playing the Fool before buying this one. Keep in mind, however, that a mediocre disc by these guys is still better than 95% of the music out there from this period. It's not that it's a bad CD, it's just that there are better versions of the material available."
2,An inferior hodgepodge,"This double CD contains what seem to be inferior alternate takes on many Giant classics. Overpriced too -- for a couple of dollars more you can own, for example, Octopus and Playing the Fool -- a vastly superior sampling of the band's work. True -- at the moment this collection is the only way to obtain some of the cuts from Giant's best album, In A Glass House, but the versions of The Runaway and Way of Life here are simply not as good as the originals."
2,a rip-off,"This product is only for the Gentle Giant completist. The source for significant portions of the program is vinyl - somewhat noisy vinyl. This fact is stated nowhere on the cover, but it is very obvious once you begin to listen to the disc.The performances are generally good, but if you are a fan you have heard most of this before with better sound."
4,Competent and well-written history of WW2 in Tunisia,"This is a very well-writen military history of WW2 in Tunisia, from late 1942 to May 1943. Although the ""Fox"" in the title refer to German general Rommel, Rommel figures in only a small part of the book because he is largely involved in his famous retreat across North Africa while much of the action in the book takes place. Once Rommel finally arrives on the scene, he makes some inspections of the military situation at hand, issues orders, then soon departs for Germany, never to return. Other German commanders, notably von Arnim, direct most of the Axis movements. The author interweaves the stories of ground and air units, large and small, and includes the experiences of many individual soldiers as well. My only complaint was that the maps were not very good and made it difficult to follow the movements of the ground units. With as much detail as was provided in the text, good maps would have made the battles much easier to visualize."
1,Could be Good,"This sounds like a wonderful idea for a garden glove.Since no size range is given,I imagine these are the teensy,dainty size gloves that women are SUPPOSED to wear.What about those of us who have large hands,yet are not men??????"
4,Dancehall,"I really enjoyed the book. This book got me hooked into mysteries. The story is very engaging, I couldn't put it down. The story leads you through lots of turns and twists and gets you in the end. Highly enjoyable read!!"
3,Good and engaging suspense,"The storyline was very engaging. Extraordinary suspense and very well developed characters. The descriptions of the surroundings and the ambience are probably some of the best I have ever read in mystery books. Uncanny ability to transport the reader to the scene into the plot. My only dissapointment was the end felt rush. With his writing talent, I would had expected a fenomenal psychological and trial courtroom drama (""Pressumed Inoccent"" type). I am looking forward to read more of Mr. Conners's work. Definitely a great mistery writer."
3,Dancehall,"I read this book many years ago and enjoyed it very much. It is my understanding a movie based on the book is underway. I ordered a copy of the book on May 8, 2010 via Amazon.com to give as a gift and as of today (6/9/10) it has not been received. The vendor has been notified, but in my opinion this is very poor service. I have ordered through Amazon.com previously and some items have been received within the week they were ordered. I am hoping there will be a satisfactory solution. Maybe the mailman is reading it before it gets delivered."
5,Great Scope,Not Much to say other then it fit my 10/22 perfectly and was dead on accurate out of the box .very happy.
1,GOLDEN OLDIES,nOT VERY GOOD QUALITY AND i RETURNED IT. wAS ONLY GIVEN ONE-HALF CREDIT FOR IT WHICH HAS REALLY UPSET ME. PROBABLY WILL NO LONGER BUY ANYTHING FROM AMAZON . REV. JOHN RICHEY
1,Sophomoric and Stupid,"A gag a minute. Obvious, slapstick, unimaginative, silly, sophomoric and stupid. I feel stupid for buying it."
3,Only for Pete and Dud fans,"Really not a very well-written film. Loosely based on the Conan Doyle story, this is a collection of old jokes and sketches which don't really hang together. A who's who of British comedy though: Pete, Dud, Kenneth Williams, Irene Handl, Max Wall, Denholm Elliot and others. Some very funny moments, not least when Denholm Elliot's chihuahua urinates for about 3 minutes all over Dr Watson (played by Dud). Probably worth seeing if you are a Pete and Dud fan, but it's not their best effort by any means."
1,I adore Pete and Dud but....,"Peter Cook was the funniest person in the 20th century beyond a doubt. And Dudley Moore was one of the reasons that Peter was so hysterical. I waited for years to see this movie, bought it when it was first released on VHS. I can't even begin to articulate how awful this movie is. Even Peter's brilliance couldn't overcome the deadly direction of Paul Morrissey."
5,What a funny dvd!,"These two are the funniest ! I love the movie 'The Hound Of The Baskervilles', and now i can laugh at it!"
1,One of the worst movies ever!,"What can I say? The acting is dreadful, voices fake and grating, the writing unimaginative. Direction? - No it seems to be missing, nothing is put together. Even if someone wants to give you this DVD, do not accept it."
5,All the knowledge in the world,"All the knowledge in the world is in this one book. Okay, maybe it just seems like it. John Seymour explains absolutely every skill you could possibly need for a self-sufficient lifestyle: gardening, animal husbandry, plowing with horse or tractor, building a hedge, brewing beer, making butter, blacksmithing, hunting, cooking, smoking, fishing, making clothes...EVERYTHING.As he says, man was not created to be a cog in a wheel--he was created to fend for himself doing a little of everything. When you're done reading this book, you'll want to go out and do just that."
5,The very best book on doing just about anything yourself!,"This book is the most amazing collection of how to on your own, I could have ever dreamed of. For anyone wanting to know how to do any of lifes basics, its in this book. I have had my copy for 20years and still can't believe how good it is. Great thats all, just Great!Get one if you can, must have!"
5,This stuff smells like sh*t!!,"Okay when i first ordered these i thought id just break them and theyd smell. But these things do more than just smell and stuff. They evacuate rooms. At a local resturant i recieved HORRIBLE service. so i pulled these out and poured the juice into their air freshners near the restroom. I set the timer to spray every 5mins and boy when i came back the next day the place was dead. And it smelled like s***. I ordered a drink and went to the restroom and poured another 3 viles into each. funny thing is when i checked it they changed the timer to spray every 30seconds...best prank EVER!!! I still dont think theyve found out and its hilarious!! Great product, cheap, great for revenge...or if you just wanna have a little fun."
3,Not very powerful,"I ordered a sleeve of these little buggers. I've deployed them near the walmart entrance several times.If you drop them outside, the smell disapates quickly. Almost unnoticeable.Inside the scent lingers a little longer, but they are not nearly as potent as I remember them being when I was a youngster."
3,Fare enough,"I was statsfied with the products but took away two stars for four reasons, came with only one itching powder, took longer than was estimated, not able to track package and was different brand than picture. Heres the contrast, fits in mail box, works well and fast, smell last 10 to 15 minutes or less, boxs are small enough to conceal and it did arrive..., i do want to note it may not be shippers fault of arrival time and may not be a consistant issue"
1,ink cartridge,I thought at first this would be a great cartridge. After only a few prints the red and yellow stop printing.
1,very disappointed in the quality.,This ink cartridge was dried up and didn't work at all. Was a total waste of money. Had to go to Office Depot to get a fresh cartridge. Someone later told me you sometimes get old dried up products like this when you order online.
1,do not buy this!,"The expiration date listed on the box was 2004. So this is old stock that has been around for a long time and did not work at all. The local office supply store has these cartridges for $43, so I made the mistake of ordering this, to save a buck. If your printer uses this cartridge, do yourself a favor and go buy a new printer for $60 and let this ""antique"" printer rest in peace.And a note to Amazon; I use this site often and think that when sellers list products that have a limited shelf life, the sellers should list the date printed on the product, and if the expiration date has expired, a disclaimer could be stated so that the buyer knows the risk."
1,RIP OFF,Ordered two tri color HP 17 cartridges. Didn't need them right away so of course the 30 day window to return expired. Neither cartridge worked. Both apparently were empty. They don't print any color whatsoever. So they are just shipping faulty cartridges.
4,HP Ink Cartridges work!,"My ink jet printer still works great but it NEEDS the real thing. HP cartridges are the only ones that consistently work--without color problems. Amazon delivers in good shape and on time, or even early."
1,Is this a scam?,I have bought this item a number of times over the years but not from this vendor. I agree with a lot of reviewers that it is of the poorest quality. I thought something was wrong with my printer when pink was the only color I could get. I jumped on over to OFFICEMAX and I sure hope they can do a better job of getting a genuine product out the door. Watch out Amazon for this vendor!
5,Hewlett Packard Printer Ink Cartridge,The product makes perfect color print and images. No loss of color until this ink cartridge is empty. Arrived here in less than allotted time-frame.
5,A poignant yet upbeat story of loss and renewal.,"Patty Dann has created a delicate miniature of a book; small, yet it covers monumental events, both in the narrator's personal life as well as in the topsy turvy world around her. Hanna, grief-stricken at losing her young husband to cancer and the stark reality that she must bring up her four year old son alone, is forced with little warning, into unknown territory. Now a ""window,"" as Pete, her zesty little son puts it, in his unerringly honest way, adjusting is often painful but also contains some sweet surprises. Hanna's gradual acceptance of her forever altered life, with the gracious help of an unusual neighbor, makes for a satisfying, sweet and slightly crazy tale. It is a highly enjoyable book."
3,Never takes off,"It's one of those books you keep waiting to start and then it's over. The characters seem lost in space and disconnected from everyone , intentionally or unintentionally , it's awkward and at times annoying. Relationships are unexplored and the outside events that are supposed to have a profound impact on the central characters sort of fizzle out. It was an easy read, but no second helpings for this book."
4,Very good,"Being a big fan of David Bowie, I picked up this book to learn more about one of my favorite albums. I'd read reviews of some of the other 33 1/3 books and was a little bit worried that the author might go off topic or write mostly about his own experience with the album. Luckily Mr. Wilcken avoids that and covers the creation of the album as well the the events and people that influenced it. He shows how Low was a connected to Station to Station and The Idiot, while also explaining the influence of Kraftwerk and others. Definitely a good choice for anyone interested in the album or Berlin era of Bowie's work."
2,Biography Gone Bad!,"This book really had very little informative stuff. This guy obviously does not know how to write a good biography. It was sooo boring and there really wasen't that much stuff. It almost seems like John Strege collected a lot of newspapers and got some info. from the internet and went straight on to write what he calls a ""biography"". It's nothing but a summary a lot of games played by Tiger...nothing more! It doesn't go much into his personal life, if that's what you want."
5,Ashleigh Flynn is an undiscovered gem!,"With a smoky voice, tremendous songwriting ability and a great sense of humor, Ashleigh Flynn's second album is a treasure and one of my favorites. She is an undiscovered talent that does not get nearly the airplay or recognition she deserves.To quote another reviewer: ""... Flynn is an amazing artist with immense talents - not the least her magnetic voice. This is an intense and convincing album that holds great promise for the future."" -- Ink19, 12/02Buy this album and spread the word!"
3,Great And Dull At The Same Time,"Sacagawea's Nickname purports to be McMurtry's essays on the Old West. Well, yes and no. Maybe half the book is that and it's really good! McMurtry is extremely insightful on this theme. His views on Bill Cody as a businessman, Annie Oakley as America's original liberated woman,Lewis and Clark, western pulp fiction, the Missouri River, Oh and Sacagawea and her various names...all great stuff.But the other half is the author commenting on other author's comments on the West. Dull."
4,"perceptive and entertaining, a little academic...","If you are familiar with many of the topics discussed in this collection, you will likely find this to be well worth your time. Anyone who has delved into western lit is undoubtably familiar with LM's inimitable style. It is readily apparent here, as is his incredible breadth of literary and historical knowledge. However, if you haven't read much of Stegner and Limerick (to name just a couple of writers LM explores),or you don't know a lot about Lewis and Clark, this may not be the place to start. As these pieces were originally written for the NYRev, the level of background needed to fully appreciate these essays is high. All in all, a thoughtful, funny and wideranging collection worth having on your bookshelf. One final note: I wish the introductory piece on western lit was longer; good as it was, it left me wanting to hear more."
1,Brandon - Professional Fluff Brush,"I was extremely disappointed with this product.It was definitely NOT was I expected.Not to mention the shipping price was OUTRAGEOUS, a complete RIP-OFF!!!I am still awaiting my REFUND.Signed,Never Again,"
1,Production company bad but Amazon is the best,"as you can see the item picture there is a whole set but I recieved only one brush and of course i gave a very bad feedback after that they send me mail saying that ""if i remove my feedback they'll give me product money back but not the shipping money which cost more than product and I say ok give my money back and I remove the feedback but they didnt accept dont know why and started to talk very rude and tell me that I'm the only one who mislead by this picture if there werent AMAZON HELP I would never get FULL refund this co could be bad but Amazon is the best"
3,Red Midnight.....Pilgrimage,"This is the best episode of the DVD.....its totally interesting and engrossing and the leading man Joe Zaso is GORGEOUS and is totally right for the part both looks and acting.Nice gore, and a really cool story with an unexpected twist. The second story Anathena is worth a look as well. I jumped a couple of times."
3,it's okay,I bought this CD to complete a collection. I bought this CD to complete a collection. I bought this CD to complete a collection.
1,2 thumbs down,"I got it for one song and then it wasn't all that once I heard it good. Maybe it has to grow on me, but I think it would be more like a tumor...something I don't want to grow on me!"
5,Very good,"Working very good so far, the image is clear and supports 1080i as expected. The cable seems very well made and resistant"
5,Not much to it.,"I was expecting something like what Beth Moore writes, this was nothing. It's short and you can't read the charts the writing is so small. It doesn't go into much detail either. If you are looking for a deep Bible study I wouldn't recommend this."
5,Cathy Bolinger's Music Is Fun,"This is our second Cathy Bolinger CD and my granddaughter, now 6, and I have enjoyed listening and singing along with both. We have many educational CD's for children - and many are a disappointment, but Ms. Bolinger's songs are catchy and fun to sing."
2,not all its cracked up to be,once I received the item I was very disappointed the picture of the curtain is very misleading as it gives the impression that the other items in the picture are included besides the shower curtain. I feel this is false advertising and one has to really read further to find out you only receive the shower curtain. Where can we find the other items which were in the picture?
1,read very very very carefully,"this was really disappointing. I only recieved the curtain and I thought it was all items listed in the picture. I checked the title again and it alludes to all in the picuture. I really wanted the other items and not the curtain. The curtain is really nice and of good quality, but I really feel I was duped. I'm not a naive amazon shopper and it's rare when something like this happens to me. Now I have to hunt to find what I really wanted. Buyer beware."
1,RIPOFF!!!!,this ink well has no practical application because of its size. i threw it away in the garbage as soon as i opened the package. it also shipped chipped even because there was no evidence of the broken piece in the box.
3,You get what you pay for,"The low price makes this ideal for beginners, but it doesn't work all that well. Mine came with the plastic lid broken and unusable. The stone also doesn't have a flat grinding surface, but rather bows upward in the center. It functions if one grinds in a circle, but if you want my advice, buy something a little more expensive and a little bit better."
3,"Image shows brown fur, I got gold fur.","A bit disappointed with this toy. I thought it would be a lot smaller and it's the size of a rat.The image shown in Amazon shows nice brown fur, the one I got was mostly gold fur. And the one I got wasn't as mouse looking as this cute little fellow in the sales image. I gave the toy to my cats."
2,Just ok,"I thought by the picture it might be a little more realistic. Lighter colored than pictured too. A mouse lover might like it. But if I saw it the store, for the price I probably wouldn't have bought it."
4,Lifelike puppets.,"I purchased two of these, one for each of my younger grandchildren for Christmas. They were so lifelike and real! They loved them! Delivery time was good, I was able to get these to them in time for Christmas."
5,So cute!,"I love Folkmanis puppets! I used them in our church and have bought several ""just because."" This little guy looks very real and is well made. He can be played with by children or set on a shelf as part of a display. Very good value!"
2,"the tail is a piece of string, people!!","It's a cute little mouse puppet, but the tail is just a piece of unfinished string. They could at least have used some fake leather or something, but we're talking shoelace material. Looks very cheap. I was very disappointed."
5,Mini Field Mouse puppet by Folkmanis,I love this little mouse. Constructed beautifully. Arrived ahead of promised date. I have purchased many Folkmanis puppets and love each and everyone.
4,A Mouse with a frayed tail,"When it arrived, it was in the box without any wrapping. When you first glimpse it looks real. However, why did they put such a ridiculous tail and hideous whiskers on it. The tail looks like a frayed boot shoe string and whiskers are white thread."
1,"Awful, horrible dreck!!","And they wonder why they don't get airplay while slamming Smooth Jazz artists at the same time. Earlier Tribal Tech albums offered actual compositions while we get spontaneous composition on Rocket Science. This might work ""live"" as part of their performance, but falls apart on repeated listenings. Wonderful players playing a bunch of mumbo jumbo. Don't waste your money on this crap and get their albums from the 90s....much better.Scott is one of my favorite players, but this is just awful."
2,Ultimately disappointing output from great musicians,"With this album it seems that Tribal Tech have decided to settle into the chair they claimed with their previous release ""Thick"" - that of great band in waiting.Whilst their earlier releases had both great playing and superbly structured songs, they have decided to eschew this approach for a more improvisational approach. Unfortunately, as talented as they are (and they are amongst the greatest musicians currently on this planet), even Miles Davis needed a set structure to improvise from. The album starts off strong, but quickly sinks into a musical morass from which it never recovers.If you want to hear truely great playing, then check out some of their earlier releases, from their first ""Spears"", through to 1995's ""Reality Check"", music doesn't get much better than that."
1,Forget it if you like to HEAR jokes told !,See my review of Volume 1; sound quality simply unacceptable.
2,The book is too old,The book was over priced compared to its quality. The book was too old (faded) looking with pencil marks....disappointed. It was my first time being disappointed after purchasing used book from Amazon.
5,Continues to be incredible,"I purchased this CD at the premiere of Arches in 2001 in the new addition of the art musuem in Milwaukee. It was a very rich experience seeing it performed live. It was not until I returned to my apartment and listened to the whole CD that I began to understand just how rich this music was. Symphony No. 2 is one of my favorite pieces of music. I am a painter and a writer and have listened to this CD now weekly for four years while working on numerous projects. Great art influences other art, I believe. And this CD has influenced me in many ways."
2,NOT worth $40,"This expansion pack simply doesn't bring enough new material to the table to warrant $40. In fact, I don't even like the new additions. I prefer to play Civ IV Gold Edition, which includes the Warlords expansion, more than Beyond the Sword."
5,awesome expansion and series,"I felt a need to comment,I am normally a shooter/more intense kind of gamer and i always though of this as kind of boring but I was definetly wrong, anyone can get into this game! I own Civilization IV complete so I have both of the expansions and they are INCREDIBLE! I notice all the differences and improvements right away all the extra civs and scenarios help but the little things in there like the random events somehow make a huge difference in the game.I instantly became addicted upon first playing even though i thought it was boring originally.To fans and all members of earth, buy this game it's addicting for anyone!!"
4,hAPPY WITH servive & game,Excellent servive an very good game. Arrived in timely fashion and wrapped in just enuff protection. Not too much an not too litte. I hate waste.Whole experince most satisfactory.Thank you.
4,Pain to load but fun to play.,Pain to load but fun to play. You have to load up dates to your civilation 4 get it to work.
1,"If you have a Dell, beware of this expansion pack","I was a Civ IV fan through Warlords, but when I tried installing ""Beyond the Sword"" on my Dell Inspiron it wrecked the whole game. When I inserted the second installation disk, the computer locked up instead of finishing the installation. When I rebooted, I discovered that I couldn't remove the incomplete ""Sword"" expansion -- it didn't show up in the programs to uninstall -- and I couldn't reinstall it either (whenever I put the disk in it, it tries to start playing the game and then crashes). And now I can't play the earlier Civ games either because it just crashes. Since I've lost the original Civ IV installation disk, this means that I've spent $20 for the privilege of wrecking a game on my computer. If I could give it a minus star, I would."
1,Didn't work,The game didn't work. Tbe second disk was bad. Contacted the company and they wanted me to send it back within a designated time. I couldn't do that. I live to far from town to justify the trip just for a game.
5,Umpteenth generation of a game,"I am not good with the computer world, but I have played ""Civilization"" since it first appeared. Each version is an improvement, but this is the best. I enjoy the new civilizations, e.g., Holy Romsn Empire, Holland, but I really like the new gossipy reports about what is going on with both my enemies and myself. It is lots of fun, even for a non-geek such as myself. I suspect computer literati would really find it difficult to leave the game and speend hours in the world they were creating."
5,CivIV Byond the Sword - It rocks,I thought this is a great addition to the original Civ IV. makes it even more challenging.
5,A nice update for Civ fans,"For those folks looking to update your Civ playing time - this new update really hits the mark. With new wonders, technologies, features and world leaders - they have given folks enough new content to freshen up the series. Some of the new features, such as the espionage and corporation elements, sort of seem more trouble than its worth, but for some of the more detailed-oriented players, they will enjoy factoring in those new game elements. Even the most casual player, however, will like some of the new wonders and units. For me, the gameplay seems to be big step up from the original Civ IV game - and that makes it a bit more enjoyable than before."
3,Is this suposed to be a JOKE??,"I have to admit we have waited so many years for this and i am disapointed. the dvd seems to not include many of her early country hit videos like :01. Wild one02. I cant do that anymore03. But i will04. Lets go to vegas05. You cant lose me06. Take me as i amIt also includes the video to ""When the lights go down"" which itself wasnt a music video. but it was taken from Faith's LIVE DVD of the same name. And dont get me started on the fact that the stunning video for her massive hit ""There You'll Be"" is not included.... whats going on?? Faith also released a video for ""Baby You Belong"" for Lilo & Stitch.If that really is the official track list of the DVD i highly recommend the track list is changed!!"
4,Hummingbird Whirler,"Set up was easy. I hung it out on our deck and it began working immediately. The day grew very, very windy and I was concerned about it jerking around so much. I placed some kitty litter within the interior of the bird via the velcro closure on the back to give it more stability and it works even better now. It is very colorful and fun to watch. Our cat likes to watch it too, but so far has made no attempts to lunge for it."
2,Whirler,"This is supposed to be an outdoor item, but it lasted only 1 year. It just couldn't take the wind. The plastic piping broke and the material started to come apart at the seams."
2,More affordable yet inferior quality,"I used these from Waterfilteronline.com for years after buying the more expensive replacements directly from Sears when we initially got the system. They are much less expensive, but something is different. Every time I replaced them (every 6 months like clockwork) there was a thick blackish/brownish ""gel"" on the first filter cartridge. It look like mold had formed and created a horrible looking jelly.It had been so long since I had used the Sears cartidges, I hadn't remembered that the OEM parts from Sears never had this problem. I have returned to buying these from Sears and have eliminated the ugly mold-jelly! I don't know what is was, but it disturbed me. It is worth the extra money to me to no see it ever again."
4,RO water filters,"Product was easy to find online, was readily available and shipped out quickly. I was pleased with the entire transaction and would recommend this vendor to all."
3,"Fast shipping, is this a ""seconds"" item?","The shipping was very good--we received the item very fast. I do wonder if this item was a ""seconds"" or irregular. The inner basket does not slide out easily, which is NOT a good thing when you are cooking and the water or oil is hot. Having the basket catch on the pot as you are trying to lift it out is really a safety issue. Where the handle is attached on each side seems to create the problem. We did not realize this until we used it for the first time, so we did not return it. But I suspect it is not first quality. After trying to order from a different source and having problems, I appreciated the fast delivery."
5,bayou fryer,i received the bayou classic 1195 stainless-steel 32 quart turkey fryer. it work great. i use it all the time --- turkeys and lobsters
5,Large corn blancher,"We haven't used this as a turkey fryer, but it has worked great for its purpose as a corn blancher. Can put large quantities of corn in at a time."
4,Wonderful Fryer,"Works like a charm, easy and even cooking would buy again makes camping easy and quick and fun and cleans up well."
4,Turkey Fryer,The Bayou Classic 1195 is a sturdy well built unit. The stainless steel is much better than aluminum. It is thicker metal and more resistant to denting. Everything worked well. The burner was easy to adjust to get maximum heat for a quick oil heat up. The four leg stand is excellent for stability. The only caveat I have was the hot bubbling oil leaking past the four rivets attaching the handles to the pot. The oil was running down the two sides of the pot and burning on the pot bottom. Not a lot but annoying. Resetting the rivets would cure this problem. Highly recommended.
2,Could be better,"I thought I was purchasing the book with the DVD, but I was wrong. This item is just the DVD. Not sure if the book had the written music but once you got to the part to play a song, it was only music tracks to listen to, not anything to watch."
4,Not just for children,"I thought this book would make it easier to learn than an adult book, it was about the same."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this for my daughter.A female instructor and a pink guitar is about as girl as it gets....Very confusing instruction. Needs a book to follow along, but it's like- hear this music and play it... What???? the dvd case said there was printable supplements on the web site--- NOTI did not like it and felt it was a waste of money and time--- and I am taking time out of my life to let you know...The free lesson that came with a cheap guitar was better!!!!!"
2,"Cute, but.....","I thought that this was a cute yard decoration, however, with any wind it comes apart and is difficult to put back together. Even though there has not been any windstorms and it is in a protected area, after about two weeks of display, it has come apart and I cannot put it back together again."
3,Good Windwheel,"Love the Flamingo - remember to off-set the tail feathers and any gentle breeze will make it spin, did replace the pole with a steel rod, the two piece didn't feel like it would survive a stiff wind."
5,Great book and wonderfully illustrated,"This book became one of my child's favorites the first time we read it. He was asking so many questions about God, I was glad to find a book that he could understand. We've enjoyed it so much, I bought seven copies and gave them to each child that attended his third birthday party this year!"
5,This book is terrific for children of all ages!,Thank you for bringing the joys of God's world into little hearts of all ages.......keep 'em coming!
4,Lightweight,"I have used this griddle a couple times on my propane stove while on fishing trips. It is made of fairly heavy gauge aluminum sheet metal, not cast like some griddles. It does the job, but the heat distribution is not great and there is not trough for grease. The non-stick coating is effective, but I cannot see it lasting a lifetime.SUMMARY- Good for occasional use, especially if the weight of a heavy griddle would be an issue."
5,Baby loves it,"This toy is so simple and is one of my son's favorites. It came highly recommended by a developmental play workshop I participated in. High quality materials, lovely sound and baby is fascinated - how did the jingle bell get inside the cage?"
3,Excellent Helen Hunt!!!!!,This film is a great film for all the girls out there who wanted to play football but wasn't allowed. Excellent for a rainy day. Way to go Helen Hunt..
4,Great family video,This is a great family video for all ages. My kids watched it years ago on TV and have asked for it numerous times - you can't find it in video stores and it hasn't been on TV in the last 7 years.
3,generally good.,"I wasn't old enough to catch this when it first aired, but Encore's True Stories channel recently covered the made for t.v. movie. Although it isn't of the best film quality, the moral is strong and universal: never listen to the flock, it tends to lead you astray. It's also interesting to see Helen Hunt in her pre-Mad About You days. However, when watching this true story about a teenage girl who longs to play football in a small town, don't expect modern Hollywood special effects or a deep philosophical script; what you expect from 1983 made-for-tv is exactly what you get."
5,Love Helen Hunt and this movie,"My neice got me into this movie when she was a early teenager, she is old now. I love this movie and watch it quite often now. Great movie and story line is true. Helen Hunt is great and young in this movie and I love her in it and the boys who play football are good in this movie also. Great directing."
3,Based on a true story,"This is one of the better movies about football based on a true story, but there is a lot of hype over the real story in it too. Regardless, it's a fun movie, and Helen Hunt is great in it, as are all of her family characters, and the actors playing the usual city fathers. It doesn't stand up to ""Rudy,"" but it's not intended to. I had it in my VHS tape library years ago, and was pleased to finally find it for a cost I was willing to pay on DVD. It's the same as the VHS tape version--no special features, but it is DVD quality."
1,quarterback princess,Very poor quility but seller was very quick to respond and return money. Now we still don't have a movie we really like.
1,Unwatchable,"DVD is unwatchable because it freezes up every few minutes. Of course, If I want a refund or a replacement I have to return the item. As it was a gift to someone in another city, that would be very difficult. Since it is defective they should just replace it with a working DVD or refund my money. What is the purpose of returning a DVD that won't play. Doln't buy this product. Unfortunate because we have been looking for a DVD of this movie for years. My granddaughter is very disappointed."
1,Total BS--NOT A TRUE STORY,"I played on the same team with her is high school. The plot is TOTAL AND COMPLETE BS! The community/school fully supported her the whole time. When this movie was being made, we were told it was being filmed outside of Philomath to shield us kids from ""Hollywood"". Looking back, I think the high school administration knew this film was going to be a highly distorted image of what really took place, so they told them to film it elsewhere. It is no wonder the Maida's packed up and left town with their tails between their legs after the movie was released.If there is a ""moral"" being taught here, it isn't about overcoming imaginary obstacles. It's about telling the truth so that you don't carry a badge of shame and guilt the rest of your life for screwing the people who worked hard to help you fulfil your dream.BTW, Helen Hunt is far better looking..."
3,QUARTERBACK PRINCESS,"A very good lighthearted movie. Tifanny, the blond chearleader, should of been the beauty pagent winner, but Tamis character was the main part of the movie. Tami should of excepted the fact that Tifanny was a better person, and she should of been much nicer to her when she was given the chance at being her friend."
3,"Great book, although somewhat dated","The book is well written and provocative. I used to use it as a supplemental text for my graduate National Security Policy course and know others have used it that way as well. His characterizations of the culture of the individual armed services remains dead-on. Unfortunately, many of the examples are mired in the Cold War days and are therefore overtaken by events. Still, worth reading if you can find a copy on the cheap."
4,Excellent Study,"Mr. Builder does an excellent job of comparing and contrasting the styles of the three main branches of the U.S. military. From warfighting to peacetime, the approaches to missions, roles, procurement, leadership styles, and corporate cultures are studied. After reading it, I am convinced I should have joined the Army instead of the Navy."
3,Unsatisfactory,The overall support is not satisfactory.The left shoe has a couple of bumps abourtwo inches from the big toe.
3,Not so good!!,"Its not that comfortable for the original price, thank God i bought it when it was on sale!!!. They are good for the water cause your feet are always dry."
3,Testing the ASTRIDE shoe,"I have worn these Astride shoes for 3 months and they are wearing out the sole at the heel and the inner back heel pad is coming apart. They are almost a half size larger than any other Rockport shoes I have worn.They are well padded and have a wide toe so they feel quite comfortable (of course this may be due to the extra insoles needed to adjust the size problem). They are a very nice comfy shoe but not what I would call "" a sturdy walking shoe'. I have worn Rockport World Tour Walkers for over 5 years and still prefer them for walking to the Astride."
3,Rockport Disappointment,"I have owned several pairs of Rockport walking shoes and have looked to them for quality. However, I was disappointed in these. The new cushion insole has a tendency to conform to the foot. That feature allowed a cushion ""build-up"" under my big toe at the joint with the foot which caused a lot of discomfort. This may not be a problem for you, but I had to switch to a different shoe. I still have faith in Rockport but not this style."
1,Soles came unglued before tread wore off,Cheaply glued soles fell off after about a year of moderate use even though there was still plenty of tread.
1,"Beautiful design, horrible calibration.","This is a great looking thermometer. The case, dial, etc. are all top notch and worthy of design awards. The actual performance of the thermometer is an entirely different matter, however. It seems to be fairly accurate up to about 60 degrees, but after that it seems to add about 10% to 20% to the actual air temperature, regardless of where it is placed. Case in point: on a cloudy day in the low 80's, the themometer read anywhere between 108 and 114 for six hours straight. It was shaded from any direct sun and was in an area that had great airflow, so my only explanation is that it was very poorly calibrated. I think the minimum and maximum tracking needles on this unit would have been very useful, so I'm disappointed that it did not work and I had to return it.Obviously my experience is only a sample of one, so factor it in with caution, but there certainly did not seem to be any manufacturing defects with the unit I received."
5,Excellent Group of Voices and People,"Joe Mattingly and The Newman Singers are a wonderful combination. The CD, Awakenings, is beautiful. I had the opporunity to listen to it live, at my Church, St. Rochus, in Johnstown, PA, and it was wonderful. We got to meet the singers afterward and they were the most nicest group of college students I have met. The CD shows to people that college kids are not all that bad. The voices in the music are phenomenal and the instrumental pieces can put you into a trance of being one with God. It is a WONDERFUL work of music and I HIGHLY recommend it."
5,...A Faithful Friend,"We just can't begin to choose our favorite song on this collection...each has become like an old friend...comforting, warm, happy,uplifting, and challenging. Karen's lilting backup vocals are unparalleled...If to sing is to pray twice, then this collection is like a prayer-ful month of Sundays!"
1,good grief! torke's music is so tedious and wearisome and..,...utterly boring -- why is this fellow such a success as a composer? this is music for morons. how long can torke keep his career going writing the same old sludge he's been churning out for more than a decade?
4,A comprehensive overview of today's country music scene.,"This is a terrific introduction -- for the newcomer -- to the world of Country Music, starting with the people who make the music and working out from there to embrace that entire world. For any longstanding Country fan, it's a chatty and respectful dossier on many favorite performers (plus a few that might yet be and a few that'll never get there.) The personality profiles eventually start to take on the same rhythm and shape, but, for the most part, this breezy, affectionate primer is as irresistible as a George Strait tune."
2,It could be a good movie.,"In this movie, an L.A. detective infiltrates the gritty underworld of a mafia drug-dealing syndicate. Things get ugly when the mafia declares an all-out turf war on their rival, a Latino drug king. I don't want to say this movie was poorly made because it wasn't. It's just that maybe it would have benefited from a bit of fine-tuning. The movie in itself is decent except the plot becomes too convoluted for its own good, and the narrative becomes garbled. Consider, for instance, a scene where the detective is fighting a street battle and then the movie instantly cuts to a scene of him making love to his girlfriend. I guess that symbolized the fact that the man was looking for transcendence or something from all the violence, but that sequence, and the movie as a whole, could have profited from a just a smidgen of subtlety."
3,"Cute as heck, has a few problems","This is hanging from a beam by our hot tub, and it is delightful - if you can get the top fin propped around so that it does not interfere with the whirlers. It is made of fabric which does not hold the shape of the angelfish very well, and the long top fin has a wire along the top to hold it out. On mine, the wire persists in turning to the side so that it keeps one of the whirlers from whirling. The solution was to hook the top fin on the tail fin, which does't look quite right but lets both whirlers do their thing."
1,too hard for a four year old to use,"thread included in the packaging was too flimsey. bracelet broke right away. needle was hard to use. hard to thread then hard to pull thru beads. breads were OK, but rest of kit not worth the money."
2,this film will make u sleep...,"i was very disapointed when i watch this film,i was using fast-forward all the time and i didn't find any good sex scene..nothing was special here,..i just love to see a beautiful woman who played as the receptionist in the office (i don't know her name) but she didn't do any sex scene or nude scene...save your money,the cover is hotter than the movie."
5,A EXCELLENT,A EXCELLENT INSIDER LOOK AT WHAT GOES ON BETWEEN PROFESSIONAL WORKERS THAT IS HIDDEN AND EXPOSED IN THIS DVD. WATCH AND LEARN!!!
4,WELL WORTH THE MONEY,"I am a tour guide at a historic site in Moultonborough, NH. This amplifier serves me very well. I use it during those times when the large number of visitors requires me to give my introduction on the trolley, starting at the parking lot in the valley and ending at the site on top of the mountain. Even with large groups in the historic home itself, the amplifier is a tremendous aid. Besides, it adds a sense of professionalism. I do, however, find that the microphone has to be very close to my mouth to get the proper amplification. In fact, I actually hold the lapel mike with one hand. Attaching it to my lapel does not work."
4,As described,The puzzle was just what I wanted. I just wish that I could have seens the dimensions before I ordered it. It was a bit smaller than I had hoped for.
2,Information on JUST Budgies,"By the cover you expect the book to be about ALL kinds of birds, but this book is mainly about Budgies. I only recommend this book for peolpe who have Budgerigars or who are interested in purchasing one. If you are going to buy another type of bird, than some of the information may apply, but not much. If you aren't getting a budgie than don't waste your time. If you are than this book may be helpful"
5,This show gets better with age!,Most CW shows are so superficial and bore me with their storylines by season 3. For me Supernatural has gotten so much better with age. Each season I worry that they have taken on something too big and each season I'm pleasantly surprised with how everything plays out and how we have seen the characters grow and develop. Not to say it's 100% perfect all the time but it comes so close! I wish more people appreciated this show because they have no idea what they're missing out on!
5,GREAT! I will definately buy from them again.,I was very SATICFIED with my recent purchase. It came on time and they wasted no time in getting my product to me!
1,The season when the shark was jumped,"This was the season where Kripke chickened out and reversed himself in order to deal with the fact that there would be more seasons than planned. Too afraid to send both brothers to Hell or kill one off permanently, and too scared of the public to go with the fact that like 90% of Lucifer's criticisms of his universe's angelic hierarchy were 100% true, he invented a third brother we never heard of before so that we would have a spare floating around. He decided that Kali needed a human to rescue her, even the good gods in other religions are all demons who all like to eat humans, and killed off almost every interesting supporting character except Bobby."
1,"""Supernatural Fifth Season""","Franks online, is JUNK!!!! Will never order from them again!Did not show pic. Just noise!Waited all this time for ""Bad packaging"". Menue was jammed inside box, on top of video 1. The holders were not meant for the dvd box. Just junk, and very un-professional...........herb neeland"
5,Supernatural Underground on Facebook Celebrating Season 5,"Attention all Supernatural Fans!I created a new Facebook fan page called Supernatural Underground and it has all the latest updates on the show,video clips and plenty of pics so if your a Supernatural fan come by and hit the like button and help me make Supernatural Underground the #1 destination for all things Winchester!ThanksAngela"
5,SSSSSUPER_ NATURALLY.,REALLY A GREAT SERIES FOR SURE....MAYBE THE BEST I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!IN LOVE WITH EVERYThING ABOUT THIS..THE BEST WAY TO SEE IT IS TO WATCH THE EPISODES IN ORDER AND FROM THE BEGINNING...WITH A SOFT BLANKET AND A HUGE BOWL OF CEREAL OR MAYBE A HUGE SANDWICH (DEAN STYLE)...QUALITY WRITING AND THE HUMOR IS JUST SPOT ON.WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE OVER 12 YEARS AND UNDER 70. (BASED ON MY NEPHEW AND MY FATHER).I HOPE THESE ACTORS AND WRITERS NEVER WANT TO QUIT WHAT THEY ARE DOING!IT NEVER BECOMES STATIC NORREDUNDANT.SIGH. MORE PLEASE..
1,Season 5 was A HUGE DISAPOINTMENT,"I was So Hooked on this show; not since I was a kid did I have to watch every week. It does start out fairly well IMO but the continued struggle back & forth between Dean & the Angels just seemed to prolong the agony of what needed to be done.. It just kept going back & forth & wasting time w/what they could have been doing. And bringing in the old favorite characters & doing what the writers did, really ticked me off. I think it was definitely a cheap move. Not sure if they had planned a 6th season but why just obliterate all the supporting characters.. It was Stoopid. I collected all of the 1st four seasons but have no intention of owning the 5th & don't have a clue what happened in the 6th. They really should have went out in a blaze of glory instead of jumping the shark. I will remember ""The Boys"" fondly & Loved the 4 years of Pure Entertainment they brought... Thank You Sam & Dean"
5,best season ever,each season of supernatural just keeps getting better and better. I really hate to see it go after this season. The Winchester brothers are trying to keep the world from ending and Sam thinks he is the only one who can do it. They defeat the 4 horseman (whom instead of rising horses ride sweet cars) and take their rings to try and stop Lucifer. The boy connect with a brother they didn't know they had as well. Not giving anything else away but it's a very power and climatic ending to the season.
5,Sneaky Sneaky,"It's amazing. Later in the series it turns more religious, very religous but even as an athiest I enjoy it. My 2nd favorite Series."
3,skipping?!,"the season was great, i love the show; however, the final disk, last episode SKIPS. i cleaned the dvd after it skipped, and it didnt work. i was really disappointed."
5,Supernatural: The Complete Fifth Season,"Supernatural!! What more needs said. The guys are hot and the show is always A+++There are episodes that stand out, but I love the series and Season 5 was GREAT with Lucifer being released from Hell and the guys having to make the ultimate sacrifice!! Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins are superb!! I highly recommend this series."
5,STILL My Favorite Show...,"Supernatural Season 5 was Eric Kripke's last season at the helm...Sera Gamble stepped up to direct season 6; After watching the whole season, you can definitely sense Eric saying goodbye--especially in the finale. I'm so glad the show didn't end, though! I LOVE season 5--I won't do any spoilers, but if you are even a lukewarm fan of the show, you will enjoy this season; and if you're a loyal, from-the-beginning fan like me, it's one of the show's best (behind seasons 1 & 3)."
4,In the End... I wish it was the end,"Kripke had a plan to end the series at this season, and you can see that in the season finale. Then they made him extend the show and stuff was added so that the show could conitnue. I keep wanting this to be the end of the series. Actually, it would have been nice for them to add an edit of the series finale without that other footage. Sam has made a heartbreaking sacrifice; Dean lives his life as family man.The End."
3,As usual a mixed blessing,As usual there were some episodes that I enjoyed and others I didn't.My big complaint is that they didn't give the option to turn the recap off as they did in the first four seasons. Welcome to mediocrity.
4,"Hit and miss season, great finale","As a long time fan of the show, i expected big things with Season 5. It definitely did not meet expectations, with four ho-hum mid season episodes that felt as if the writers were padding. Some fans have pointed out that Lucifer had far too little screen time and they're right. But once the season came into the final stretch, it regained its footing, picked up steam and featured some of the best moments of the past five years. I'm hoping that another viewing of the season on DVD will soften my objections."
5,My Sister Loves This Series.,"This was a gift to my sister for Christmas, she loves these guys and the series, she was thrilled that I bought her the complete seven seasons."
4,supernatural the 5th season,If you're a supernatural fan you're going to love it. I don't watch the episodes on network TV because of the commercial interuptions and they are cut and edited. Can't wait for season 6.
5,Supernatural The Fifth Season,Supernatural The Fifth Season is Great on DVD & I Like Watching All The Episodes on DVD in HDMI 1080 & My Favorite on This TV Series is Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester & My Next Favorite is Castiel The Angel & Sam Third & Bobby as Well & Supernatural is 1 of The Best TV Series on Television & They Won a People Choice Award For Favorite Syfi Show on TV This Year 2012.
5,The best TV series I've ever seen!,"This is a superb TV series! I was told this is a god series and good thing I checked it, now I'm hooked and obsessed. If you like exciting, thrilling and kind of horrifying TV series this is the one you should check. This will definitely give you mixed emotions....I know coz I did. I can't wait to see how the brothers are in season 7, but I feel a little sad because when the season 7 comes,it means there's no more Supernatural. Nothing more to say...just watch it and see for yourself."
5,Supernatural's Best of the Best -- so far!,"Cannot adequately express how outstanding the whole Supernatural saga is. It should definitely receive more recognition for its excellence than it has received so far. The acting, writing, production values, story lines, and overall perfect meshing of character and story is unparalleled on TV right now.Sat down to watch the entire Season 5 set of DVDs in preparation for the premiere of Season 6 on September 24. I will be incommunicado the evening of 9/24 -- everybody just back off! It's the new season of Supernatural!Rejoice, and be afraid, very afraid.... Ha!"
3,funny extras,this is not the best season of the series but it's worth buying nonetheless if you like Supernatural. It's for collector.
5,super,"hey, what can i say? Jensen Ackles! That is almost enough! He's hot, he's sexy, he's cool! And the gag reel are soooooo funny! It's one of the best serie all over the world!"
5,Addictive,"I caught one episode on rerun and was immediately hooked. I bought the whole series on dvd and watched it all in a week. I just could not get enough. I have finally caught up on season five and can not wait for more. These two guys are sexy and fun and have great onscreen chemistry. I am going to warn you, once you watch it is like a drug, you are completely addicted."
1,what the hell,its broken. the discs are intact but the case is broken on the side- soooo not like new and inside the spine that hlds the dvds is broken too. soooo not satisfied.
3,Compelling & intriguing but...,"...the season ender was a HUGE letdown. The entire season was building up to a climactic battle between the archangel Michael and his banished little brother who happens to be Lucifer the lord of all thats evil in the world; but when it came time for the big showdown, what should have been a battle of cosmic proportions complete with fire, brimstone, and hell on earth destruction is substituted with a mild argument between two brothers who will never see eye to eye on things! I guess thats all what the showrunners could come up with given only a TV budget to work with. If only this were turned into a feature film with a million -dollar budget, the ending that should've been would definitely have made the entire season worth it. Other than the ending, the rest of the season is superb television at its best.Happy Hunting!"
5,Supernatural Season 5 the best yet,All supernatural fans....must buy season 5. This is the best yet!!!! Can't wait for the next season
5,A Must Have - No Question About It !,I have every season of Supernatural and this one is fabulous. It seems like it just gets better and better.The Winchester boys never fail to entertain. They make you laugh and then turn around and hold your attention with suspense. Good writing and good acting make for a very enjoyable season of entertainment. I would recommend this to everyone .
5,Excellent purchase!,"Go Hastings is an excellent company. I have purchased several items and have always been pleased. In addition, I enjoy the Supernatrual series and for those of you who are fans of supernatural, angels, and demons - you will enjoy this too."
2,This book doesn't deliver,"I bought this book because the binding looked good, had nice illustrations and the contents seemed interesting. I read the book and thought it was reasonably well written. However, scientifically there is a BIG problem with this book. The author doesn't refer to her sources, with the exception of an out of print book on mythology by a person named Bankroft. That a white person travelled all over the America's, from the Artic to the Amazon, with his followers before Columbus is scientifically impossible. There is absolutely no scientific evidence to back this up. Moreover, I have been involved in Native American issues for more than 25 years and have never read any of the ""myths"" the author recounts in this book. So, people that are seriously interested in Native American history and mythology should skip this book. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is for the wonderful illustrations."
1,"Author has no degree, early science fiction and science writer","From Partners in wonder: women and the birth of science fiction, 1926-1965 By Eric Leif Davin ""Finally, there is L Taylor Hansen, the only early woman author who seems to have deliberately concealed her gender. Over a period of almost twenty years (1929-1948) L. (Lucile) Taylor Hansen published eight stories, mostly in Amazing Stories. In addition, she also had a long-term business relationship with Amazing. From 1941-1949 Hansen wrote fifty-seven articles on science and history for the magazine, then edited by Raymond A. Palmer. She also intermittently attended the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in the 1920s, although she never graduated. And she may also have been the sister of chemist Louis Ingvald Hansen, who received his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota."""
1,Fraud!,Not historical. Not verifiable. Not peer reviewed. Completely enthnocentric. This writer did not attend Stanford as claimed. This writer could not possibly be the expert she claimed to be especially in light of all the years she spent writing and publishing science fiction at the same time she claims to have been studying ancient cultures. Do not be fooled. This is fiction cleverly interwoven with cherry picked historical facts.
4,"Who was this wonderous healer, teacher, miracle worker?","Anthropologist L. Taylor Hansen, long fascinated with Indian history and legends, traces legends of Indians of the Pacific and American continent which all seem to include an account of a white bearded healer who visited them anciently (probably during the 1st century) taught each group a philosophy of love, performed miraculous healings, curiously controlled forces of nature and established a Priesthood of 12 elders. After traveling throughout the Americas, he departed by sea from the ancient city of Tula on the Yucatan pennisula with the promise that he would return in the future. Hansen never claims this legendary healer was Christ, but the similarities are remarkable. The Book of Mormon reports that Christ also visited the American continent. It is reported Hansen had never heard of the Book of Mormon when he wrote his account. Interesting read, particularly for those wondering if Christ visited other lands."
4,"Not made perfectly, but fits and works well","The grill is pretty much what we wanted, and is pretty much what's shown in the picture. Our patio is 9ft by 3.5 ft, so there's barely any room, but this little grill makes it possible for us to have grilled steaks, hamburgers, hotdogs, and veggies, with perfect grillmarks and the right amount of smokey flavor we like! we've used it a few times, and haven't had any problems. Yeah, the charcoal drawer wasn't flush with the barrel, but it still does a good job of holding a coals, letting the ash fall to the bottom, and makes cleaning out the ash less of an inconvenience. The wheels were really loose, and made of cheep plastic, but we don't mind because it's staying in that one spot on our tiny patio. It looks great, even with the drawer, and it was exactly what we ere looking for. Also, my husband and I were abel to put it together easily, it doesn't take rocket science. For $89, it's worth it."
5,Best made small Grill I have ever owned!,This is one of the best small grills that I have ever owned. It was easy to assemble and I loved it so much that I bought my sister and her husband one. The steel that the Grill is made of is so heavy that it can stand the weather. I keep mine covered yet the heavy gage steel would handle the weather without rusting out the 2nd season like most grills. It holds a fire well and uses very little charcoal. The grill surface is large enough to cook for 2-4 people. Excellent grill for the money and well made!
3,"You'd better be an ""Assembly Pro""","The grill itself performs well, once you figure out how to put it together (and I'm a retired architect). The manual is in chinglish, and there are MANY loose parts.... some incorrectly identified. Assembly required half a day. One of the wheel hubs came broken, so one wheel is now held on with a large rubber band. Since it was made in China, I despair of getting a replacement, and I'm certainly not going to take it apart and send it back at this point! (the wheel is one of the last things to go on.)"
3,"Patio - Pro for the ""assembly pro""","I received my much anticipated delivery, just in time for the 4th. The Patio Pro came damaged, inside an undamaged box, from the factory, and it had extra and missing hardware. I am usually most surprised when a purchase is actually intact and functioning. My unit is similar to the one advertised, however, mine came with a nifty locking hardware for the ash drawer. Not sure how it works even with the drawer closed as tightly as possible it doesn't latch (unit was damaged and is slightly out of round) The instructions are worthless and you will need to rely on your common sense and mechanical abilities. I chose not to return the unit (holiday weekend) for its defect only because I did not want to be bothered dis-assembling the unit and reassembling a replacement....On a positive note, I am optimistic it will work as well as others have attested, after all it's only a charcoal grill. We'll see. Happy July 4th."
2,Some assembly required...defective welding on drawer.,"Just unpacked and put together this grill (early birthday) and my husband pointed out a defective 'weld' in the firebox tray, which affects the way the tray slides in and out of the grill and holds in the coal. The tray itself needs to be replaced, but taking apart the entire grill to put it back in the box to reship back to manufacturer is not feasible. Not sure if this is a factory flaw on all, or just ours.Shipping and packaging, however...was quick and nicely done."
1,"Amazon great, people who built this grill awful","I am not going to just mirror the same things said by the other 1-2 star reviews, but I ran into the same issue. Parts not fitting together: the main cover for one thing and it should be very tight, but has openings around the edge when closed so what is the use of dampers. Had many missing nuts/bolts/washers so I had to go to Ace Hardware. Had to figure out myself how to put it together since the instructions were a mess and contradictory. Mentions moving the grate but this model does not move. Just overall is something I am sure will not last beyond a year at best. That is all."
1,"Great grill, but prepare for Christian literature if you order spare parts!","I bought the Char-Griller Patio Pro with side fire box because of the many good reviews on Amazon. The grill is great: not high-end, but with great features; it works well for smoking and grilling, especially after I seasoned it inside and out.I needed some spare parts and ordered them directly from Char-Griller, from the address in the owner's manual. They arrived fine, but, stapled to the shipping receipt, I found enclosed some literature about ""have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior"", etc. etc. Now, I am a Unitarian; I don't find Jesus offensive. But I do find evangelists offensive. Be aware that this company thinks it's appropriate to include religious solicitations with their merchandise."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!,"It is sad to say but the days of a solid American made product is dead! The smokers made by Char Griller boast that they are American made, and covered by a warranty...then in the small print it says 'the paint may peel off your smoker upon first use (it should say WILL peel off upon first use!), the paint is not covered by the warranty.' if you are unfortunate enough to own one of these then you know what I am talking about, both my grill and side smoker are all but devoid of paint. I called Char Griller and told them that I was appalled by their underhandedness, they didn't seem to care. well the best (or worst) advertising is word of mouth. and I have nothing good to say about this product!"
4,Decent BBQ -- good for the price,"This BBQ is pretty good -- no real issues BBQ-ing various food items. It was a pain in the butt to put it together though and the directions were pretty bad. I would say this is a good BBQ for the price, but have some patience putting it together..."
2,Difficult to work with,"I'm not thrilled with this grill, primary because of its design. It's really hard to work with if you're trying to do anything more than grill a couple of steaks or hamburgers. The opening is too small and you cannot adjust the height of the grates. On the plus side, charcoal seems to heat up really fast - I think I use less charcoal and everything seems to cook faster too. But, given the way I use a grill, this probably was not a good choice for me--I cook a lot of roasts and veggies on the grill and this just isn't very good for that kind of cooking."
4,Great Graphic,An informative poster and an attractive one. The only drawback is the tiny print which is difficult to read unless the reader is very close.
5,Nice poster,great quality and nice size...perfect for my son's room. Just add a frame for a special look in any room.
1,Do Not Buy Rand McNally StreetFinder and TripMaker,"I have purchased successive versions of StreetFinder and they seem to continually get worse...In some cases, it shows sidewalks as streets. In other cases, the streets it maps are simply incorrect. Even the way it labels streets and highways is poorly done. In short, do not buy this product..."
1,This movie sucked,"The plot was good, but the people couldnt act at all. The ending was stupid and actually an anti-climax. Do not buy or rent this movie!"
3,Horror movie,"I am not a big fan of horror movies, and this one I would say is ok. I had the chance to see it, and I think that it could have been done better. The drama is good overall in my opinion.*Sponsored Post"
1,Please pick up garbage along the road if you want to provide a usefull good or service.,"This was not the movie I thought it was. It was some half wit production where the editor couldn't even edit out the ""cut"" at the end of one scene. I think this movie was presented as though it was the 1970s original movie which was good. Isn't there some law against using the same name in 2 movies or books? Please subtract the 1 star I had to give this POS in order to post this comment."
1,So bad I couldn't stop!,This movie and it's actors were so laughably bad that I had to watch the whole thing! It was unbelievable.
1,WARNING! The trailers are RRR rated!,"I got this movie for my son because it was PG, but when we popped it in the player, the first trailer had VERY R rated NUDITY and the second trailer had VERY R rated language!The movie itself was awful in terms of acting, style and story, but it did not have any offensive content. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR KIDS!"
1,Make it STOP!!!,"This movie is flat-out horrifying. No, it's not the ghosts that make it so scary, it's the acting. This has to be one of the worst acted and mind numbingly boring movies to have ever entered into my home. The makers of this film should issue an apology to everyone who has ever actually sat down and watched this waste of time. Avoid it at all costs, even if it means gouging out your eyes and sticking a screwdriver in your ears."
1,DON'T BUY THIS FILM!!!,"Oh my God! Now, I'm a major horror buff and I appreciate cheesy B films, even C films! But this one, like someone else said, was just plain awful. The actors were no good, you can tell that it was really low budget 'cause you can hear the echo when they spoke (think porn movies). I gave it 1 star because I had no choice.Too put it in short, I would suggest NOT buying any Maverick films, Creepyflix films, and some (NOT ALL) Anchorbay and Lionsgate films. Oy!"
1,wow...,"I wish there was a way to give this a rating below one star, because this movie certainly doesn't deserve any. I'm a sixteen-year-old highschool junior and i know for a fact that I could write a better script than this. PLEASE don't waste your money. As the person who reveiwed this before me said, watch this only to make fun of the bad acting.Oh, and for the record, you can actually hear the director yelling ""Cut!"" at the end of one of the scenes."
1,Too Bad I Have Give This Movie 1 Star,"I wish I could rate this movie 0 stars. Or better yet, a negative star rating. I couldn't even watch the whole thing because it was so terribly put together. About 45 minutes into the film I found my self looking for a pencil so I could shove it in my ear! Why? Because if I'm going to be in such pain, I might as well inflict it on myself. The acting is terrible, the cinematography is just as bad and because of the lack of extras, you get the idea that the only people that exist in the entire world are the main characters.Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go dig graphite out of my ears."
1,Very deceiving movie,"I bought this movie thinking it would be good, but it drags, and didn't appeal to a really good horror movie. It was played up t be scary but didn't follow through."
2,Cheaper-looking than expected,"I was a little disappointed with the quality of the glasses. Half of the rhinestones were cloudy and barely visible. I realize that these were not expensive, but they would only be appropriate for a costume."
2,"Complete Crap, uknown needed accessories.","I ordered these with intentions of getting a brighter brake light, well after I installed them I had NO BRAKE LIGHTS OR TURN SIGNALS. The running lights worked fine though, but this product is not worth your time nor the money.Update: I found out that there was a required HIL-Resistor that I had to purchase. This came as a surprise since there was nothing in the product description about any accessory. $12.00 on top of $20.00? Not very efficient."
5,Awefully useful and a good value,"I love the long stroke I can use when reshaping chisels on this diamond stone. I was going to invest in a bench grinder, but this stone cuts quickly enough that I think I can do without (at least for a while yet). It has to cut at least three times as fast as my course Norton India stone. Also good for flattening waterstones."
4,Really sharp knives,I have had this for a while now and it does a fantastic job on my small pocket knives to my long fish filleting knife.
3,Presentation Could be Clearer.,"I am a physical chemist and this book CONTAINS all the important essentials on the subject, but at the same time presents it in a disorganized boring manner... The subject in general seems to suffer from a callous dryness in presentation and explaination."
2,Undergrad in Chemistry Review,"God help the poor fools who use this book for an undergrauate physical chemistry course. The material in the book is is thermodynamics at its best, but for an undergrad, its too much. Many of the end of chapter problems are rigorous, and there are no helpful examples with in the chapter that will assist you. What the book doesn't mention is usually what is asked. Great for engineering students, but awful for undergrad chemistry students."
1,This Book Has Taken my Soul,"I pity the poor fools who are required to use this book. It is poorly written and chronically confusing. Words are arbitrarily put in bold type and then not defined in any manner whatsoever. Other words with lengthy definitions only merit italicized print, in some hierarchy of type that only the author understands. The ""outline"" system of organization inevitably bogs down into minor details that not only take pages to slog through, but do not reappear in any of the subsequent problems. And let's not forget the dreaded thermodynamics section in which enthalpy is defined only as an equation and not in any way that can be explained in real world terms. Finally, this book provides no decent review of most of the concepts it assumes readers already know. Either you need to keep your general chemistry text of choice handy, or suffer in silence.Please do not go down the same path I did, it only leads to sorrow. Avoid this book at all costs."
1,Junk !,"This book is not worth to buy. It made easy materials become very complicated. Apparently,the writer just wanted the students to feel stupid. Avoid this book !"
5,Didactic and up-to-date textbook on most important topics.,"An up-to-date textbook on the main and selected topics included in most undergraduate courses of physical-chemistry for chemistry, engineering, sciences and related fields curricula. Subjects include fluids(gases and liquids), solid state chemistry, quantum theory, electrochemistry, surface phenomena, chemical kinectics, thermodynamics, among others. All of the material is presented with mathematical rigor, although nothing but essential calculus knowledge is required. Highly recommended"
2,Could be worse,"This was the textbook for my physical chemistry I & II classes, and though hideously boring and amazingly disorganized for such a text, it forced me to learn the concepts. (that, and the exams) I hated Pchem intensely, but it is such a boring subject to survey (vs. specific topics) that I cannot imagine a general PChem text ever being interesting and comprehensive at the same time. Furthermore, it could be much worse, as the text for our advanced inorganic course (Bowser) proved."
3,"Suitable for class, but not independent learning.","The 7th edition of this textbook is a more than adequate introduction to physical chemistry, but contains many chapters beyond this basic level that are inadequate at best, including those on quantum chemistry and kinetics.Included in the appendices are reviews of basic (high school) math and physics principles necessary for comprehension of the material, as well as an impressive Data section containing a plethora of tables covering a wide range of topics. However, a lack of depth, clarity, and mathematical rigour make for a frustrating experience for the independent student."
1,A world of pain without reprieve!,"This book is the absolutely worst choice one could make for a physical chemistry course. Atkins's main selling point is: ""By Jove, it's the 7th edition!"" a whole generation of physical chemists has been trained to think that Atkins's is the only decent pchem text out there.The book is confused, muddy and arbitrary. Some concepts get great explanation. Many simple techniques have painstakingly done proofs and then the complicated techniques just get lots of hand-waving or worse...no explanation.If you interested in actually learning some pchem, buy Lionel Raff's new text from Prentice Hall (ISBN: 013027805X). Barring that, buy an advanced physical text in the subfield you specialize in, such as Carroll's Structures and Perspectives on Organic Chemstry.Whatever you do, don't buy this textbook!"
2,Not For Learning on Your Own,Without a decent this book is difficult to understand. The example problems in the book have nothing to do with the exercizes and problems given at the end of the chapters. I suppose it would be a good book if you have a teeacher that can fill in the things the book doesn't cover well it would be a good book. It is diffucult to learn from the book without additional resources.
5,Physical Chemistry,"As other reviewers, I cannot understand the poor reviews to this book. It might just be that some of the reviewers are students having a hard time with a topic that admittedly is difficult. But this book is a fine piece of work. Very well organized, well written, and doing a extremely good job of all the material it covers. Illustrations are super. I use this book mostly to review some concepts related to my work and I have always found it useful. Something that surprises me is how well the author describes some concepts that belong to totally distinct fields such as some laser fundamentals. Anyone working at that grey zone between Chemistry and Physics should have this book as a reference. Even old editions like the one from 1996 continue to be quite relevant."
2,Hard to follow and understand,"I found this book hard to follow, and the problems confusing to understand even after reading the chapters. Many of the exercises were difficult to figure what was wanted. This along with lack of proves for many of the formulas made this one of my least liked texts books."
2,Difficult to Follow,"The lack of mathematical derivation of therodynamic relationships make this text very difficult to follow. The author had inadvertently and audaciously assume students can derive and master all the mathematics behind these therodynamic relations. As a reulst, students are forced to memorize these relations and play with the mathematical statements WITHOUT knowing the physical interpretation pertaining physical chemistry. The sections on solutions and mixtures are extremely poor-organized and difficult to comprehend. Aside from the content of the text, the small weird print is just too annoying and the price is ridiculously high. Not recommended."
2,not written very well,"When I was studying physical chemistry, I did not enjoy reading this book. Instead I went to my school library in order to check out other physical chemistry books which explained the material in a more concise, coherent manner. Problems with the book include the fact that: (1) the print is small, (2) the author does not use boldface terms in order to distinguish those equations and ideas which are important and (3) the author repeats certain ideas far too often while failing to address others. I hope that a new book will be used next semester."
1,look elsewhere,"This text is ridiculous. It has been suggested by other reviewers that those who fail to understand this text simply can't grasp p-chem. After two semesters of p-chem, as a chem major, I have learned one thing: this book stinks. I suggest McQuarrie or Kauzmann.Atkins reads as if it were written in German and translated by one of those pocket-translators for tourists. The organization is absurd: how they came up with the idea of separating the concepts from the mechanics of every major idea is beyond me. Why they separate the mathematical justifications from the discussion of the equations, I don't know.the Advice: find another way to learn p-chem. ESPECIALLY if your professor stinks."
1,Useless textbook,"This textbook was not worth the money you spent. You won't gain any knowledge from the book. Even the professor who taught the P-Chem course found this book very badly written and useless. If your P-Chem instructor told you to buy this book, neglect him/her and buy McQuarrie's (very good) or Levine's Physical Chemistry instead."
3,A good reference book,"While this book is not a good undergraduate Physical Chemistry text, it's a good book to turn to years down the road for information on pretty much everything."
1,THE WORST CHEMISTRY BOOK I HAVE,"As a undergraduate student at Hamline Univerity, I found Atkins physical chemistry book hard to read, unless and only confused me more about a subject that I want to explore further in Grad. School"
2,Covers a lot...but....,"This book is great in that it covers the many topics associated with physical chemistry. On the other hand, because the book is so poorly written and organized, it fails to do anything but give the student a brief introduction to p-chem. My school uses it simply becuase it contains both the therm/kinetics and the quantum/spectroscopy aspects of the course. The professors, however, go far beyond the book even in the introductory class. This is not a book that you can just pick up, read, and expect to know anything more about p-chem than you did when finishing general chem. So, read it. Then talk about the topics with friends to try to understand Atkins ramblings. Make sure your professor explains the topics in depth. And buy another book for reference."
1,Horrendous presentation of physical chemistry,"This book is far too basic for even the average chemistry student, much less one who might be interested in knowing why some of the concepts discussed happen to be true. The solutions to problems are incorrect on many occasions, and the text is poorly organized and tends to not follow the logical progression of learning this subject material. I would very highly not recommend this text to anybody, but would rather recommend specific texts on molecular spectroscopy and quantum chemistry (the McQuarrie text is especially good)."
1,The worst book for Physical Chemistry,"Atkins confused people more than he made people understand. This book couldn't explain in a good manner. The treatment in the Thermodynamics is poor. However, the Quantum is pretty well-written. It will be better if you use Gilbert Castellan's Physical Chemistry or Ira Levine's instead of this bad book."
1,Total garbage.,"This terrible text did not provide enough detail in which to understand any of the problems or derivations. The publisher did provide a correction sheet of over 200 mistakes, but sadly left out another binding which started coming off literally two weeks after purchase. I have no idea how this text was organized. It seems to have been a half hearted attempt at best, and a total ripoff at worst. As a physical chemist, I am always appalled at the quality of this text."
4,Comfort Shield Terry Waterproof Mattress Protector,"This is a nice mattress pad. It washes nicely and the price is excellent considering there are brands that run for $100 that are made from the same material. It does sleep ""hot"", meaning you tend to get overheated while sleeping. We are always kicking the covers off! Great to use in the winter instead of turning up your heat , but come summertime I will go back to a regular mattress pad that lets you ""breathe""."
3,Matress Protector,"This matress does the job it's supposed to do, and protects the mattress from spills. Unfortunately, to the hand it feels generally cheap and flimsy. Although it fits my deep mattress it does not have the strength in its elasticity to fit tightly enought to keep the protector firmly on the bed. Consequently, over time it tends to bunch up under the sheets. For the price it is probably good value, but you are getting what you pay for! For a future purchase I would probably pay a little extra for a better quality product."
2,Not so good.,"Purchased this product for our 15mo sleeping in an big boy bed.After a couple of washings the very thin plastic liner peeled off.We still use the terry cloth cover over the standard pad, for what reason I don't know.Very conflicted as some reviews for this product are very positive.Our experience, its not worth the $40."
4,Depression Lifter,It took me out of my doldrums and got me laughing. I love his interesting view on life but always comes back to Jesus.
5,Funny,"Mark Lowry's book was very good as I know it would be, he can be very funny but also very serious. Mark is very talented and is used by God."
3,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the picture shown with the bright pink, yellow, orange and green - I wanted them for attention-getters in my work....what I got were the not-so-bright pink, yellow, orange and blue....these will work but they weren't what I ordered....bumbed"
5,AMAZING BOOK!!!!,"This book is the best. It is very intense, but great. You will not want to put it down!"
3,too much disaster,"I did like this book, but I really think that this book has way too much natural disaster. First there's an earthquake, then there's a fire, then two tsuanami waves. Just to add to that, there's also a bully. Everything that happens is too much for me, especially since it all happens on the first night the family is there. I must agree with another reviewer about the fact that it possibly was a sunshine state book due to the tsuanami of 2004. Even though I enjoy excitment, there's too much of that in this book for me. I still would recomend this book to people who love action."
1,Escaping the Giant Wave Review (...),I myself didn't like this book it was boring.Anyone that likes volince may not want to read this book.
5,A Catchy Book For Ages 8-11,"Escaping the Giant Wave is an exciting fiction story. The author's name is Peg Kehret. The main characters are Kyle, Bebe, and Darren. Kyle and Bebe are brother and sister. Darren is a bully who picks on Kyle. Later on all three of them end-up going on vacation together.I think the book was an exciting and out-going book. There were cliff hangers and unexpected parts. Sometimes I couldn't stop reading it was so good. Some parts were slow, but mostly fun. It was slow when a friend dies, but I won't tell who.I recommend Peg Kehret's book to kids that are 8-11. Also to kids who like books where something is always wrong. I would think most kids would like Escaping the Giant Wave. I hope every one does love this book."
5,Exhilarating Read!,Escaping the Giant Wave is an exhilarating book that I read every year to my fourth graders when I am teaching water as a science to my class. All of Peg Kehret books are stimulating stories about real life situations with cliffhangers at the end of each chapter! Peg Kehret is a well researched author who writes amazing stories that children and adults love to read. I have many of her books in my classroom library. Once I read a Peg Kehret book that kids are checking out her books from the library and enjoying her well written stories. Thanks Peg Kehret for getting my fourth graders into reading again!
2,j.c.'s review,"This book, Escaping The Giant Wave by Peg Kehret was pretty good. I didn't really like it, I guess it's because I'm 13 and didn't really get into it as younger kids would. The story is about a kid named Kyle his sister a bully named Daren and their families go to an inn and a tsunami hit. The main thing I didn't like is Daren. Daren does add since to the fact there is a bully, but it gets aggravating hearing Kyle complain and not do anything to make him stop. The part I liked was when the in they where staying at the Inn and it was on fire. The book Escaping The Giant Wave was an O.K. of a book but I've read better. Over all I think Escaping The Giant Wave was good for third to sixth grade. A really good part of this story was the part where Kyle went in the woods and the second wave hit. On a scale from one to five, five being the greatest, it's about a three. It's good book don't get me wrong it just didn't seem to grab my attention."
2,Unexpected,"I bought this album firstly for the price and second for the track listing that it has (as it does indeed have some good songs on it).The trouble is they are not given justice by the harmony singers, who make the songs sound cheesy, camp and like the worst type of christian songs.It reminded me of another album I bought when younger -The Big Band Bond- which had all the decent James Bond songs on it, but had them done in the Big Band style of that Pop Idol albumThe Long and Winding Road. In other words, this album takes good material and ruins it in delivery, by trying to stretch it to their particular style.To conclude: don't buy this album unless you like harmony singers doing cover versions of songs. If you want some decent songs (and don't mind shelling out a bit) tryThe Best New Praise and Worship Songs... Everor, better still, get anything by Hillsong!"
3,price,i have baught this item at my local family dollar for $2. The tail doesnt stay on well. looks cute.
4,"I'm a huge Tiger Lillies fan, but was a tad disappointed...","I was introduced to the Tiger Lillies by going to see Shockheaded Peter in the theatre. I LOVED it. I saw it twice. Then I became obsessive about finding out all there is to know about this absolutely fabulous band. I ordered this CD. And I dunno..I was a bit disappointed. It's still good, but I guess it's like seeing the movie after reading the book...it just wasn't as good as seeing it live. It was too polished. And some of the eerie little sound effects between the songs in the play were missing on the soundtrack. I'd have to say that this isn't my favorite CD by them, although it is still rather good, because, after all, it's the Tiger Lillies and they rock!"
5,A Brilliant Piece of Musical Theater,"First of all, this is not for everyone. It can be very annoying. It kind of reminds me of Tom Waits and Three Penny Opera. If you like odd ball and eccentric recordings you may want to try it. With minimal musical accompaniment, basically an accordian, the songs tell the tales of unruly children that meet tragic ends. The singer delivers the songs in a falsetto that creates a very stylized sound. It is strangely sad and in it's own way, very beautiful."
1,ugly,"I bought this book on impulse, my bad. I did not look close enough to realize that this book, even if not clearly labeled as erotic fiction, belongs to that category. I don't mind explicit sexual content in books, but mainstream novels need to have some redeeming qualities. This one is just ugly. There is no plot to talk about, writing is mediocre, and the only lasting impression after reading it are tastes and smells of various bodily secretions. Skip it."
3,A Steamy Night Spent with this Book,"_The Last Night I Spent with You_ is a racy novel about an elderly couple that escapes the monotony of life by taking a cruise and indulging in their sexual fantasies.When I was first reading this book, I had to put it down for a day or two to recover from the highly graphic sex scenes. The book may catch you off guard at first, but at the same time it is challenging and pushes its readers out of their comfort zone._The Last Night I Spent with You_ is beautifully written; Montero utilizes vivid imagery and symbolism to tell a story about love--physical, romantic, all--and people's efforts to keep it fresh."
5,Razer Sharp,This diamond stone works quite well. Better than I expected. In about a minute you can obtain a razer edge on hard steel blades.
4,Works,Not much to say about this - it works like it is supposed to. I use this stone to hone my lathe tools.
2,Not size advertised,"Stone in not 6 inches by 5 inches. It is 6 inches by 2 1/2 inches but two sided. Deceptive description! OOPS is not two sided ,only one ,fine (orange)."
5,This makes it a lot easier to keep your knives sharp!,"I'm fanatical about keeping my knives sharp, and with a sharpening stone that doesn't develop a ""belly"" with time, this thing is great. All you need is something to hone a freshly sharpened knife, and you're right as rain!Remember to NEVER use water on this thing while sharpening; just clean the diamond surface of metal, and you're good to go."
5,Great sharpener for the kitchen.,I bought this at Lowes and it works great. Mainly used it for my kitchen knives and it took only seconds for it to sharpen. But next time I'll definitely check amazon.com prices first since it's alot cheaper!
5,indispensible,We purchased this this stone to replace a years old one that had simply worn out. We have good carbon steel knives that we keep sharp. This stone makes it easy.
5,I'm not your daddy,I've been looking for a KC&tCCs; for a while and finally got this.Fantastic! How this band never hit it huge is beyond me.Originally bought the LPs 'Wise Guy' & 'Fresh Fruit in Foreign Places' and it changed my world.
5,Daugherty : Music :: Lichtenstein : Art,"The music of Michael Daugherty is deeply rooted in the American psyche because of his focus on pop culture. In an analogous way to the pop art style of some modern visual arts, Daugherty uses familiar motifs and patterns to create soundscapes that are quite evocative.Some of his critics claim that portions of his music are 'trite' or 'cliches', but this is precisely the point with pop art. Daugherty is able to create beauty from new use of the mundane.While not everyone will enjoy Metropolis, it is an emminent work in the sense of connections between movements in visual art and music. Just as Schoenburg reflects Kandinsky, Cage reflects Pollak, and Stravinsky reflects Picasso, so does Daugherty reflect Lichtenstein."
2,numbingly repetitive...,"I came across this disk the other day, and remembered that I'd listened to it once, then put it aside. WHY, I couldn't remember. So I listened to it again. The answer was -- it's pretty bad music.Most of its five movements take moderately interesting ideas, then beat them to death with tedious repetition. Mr Daugherty has apparently never heard of the principle of ""development"" -- that one of the things that makes music interesting is that it starts somewhere, goes somewhere, and ends somewhere.I have no objection to a ""Superman symphony"" -- composers have based works on less-worthy topics. It's just that I'd prefer to listen to something that doesn't make you feel as if you've been beaten about the head for a half hour. Most of Schoenberg's atonal music is more-appealing and entertaining. Really.If you think hearing metal trash cans being banged around is fun, you'll probably like this."
4,Great Piece of Post Modern Music,"I bought this to find out what the orchestra I play in was getting into for a concert last spring. What a great piece of music! Fun to play, fun to listen to. I was a little discouraged to discover that his ""Dead Elvis"" (from another CD) was VERY close to ""Red Cape Tango,"" but all-in-all, it's still full of interesting ostinati and fun little hooks.I'd love to see Bizarro done on a marching band field, but I know it'll never happen. There's a great interplay in the piece between the horns and percussion that I just scan back and play, scan back and play, scan back and play..."
1,What the hell is this?,"I am serious. What is this? What does this have to do with superman? I don't understand. In the program notes, Daugherty makes no sense in explaining his rationale (or non-rationale) for the structural models of each movement...but I can even see what those explanations have to do with Superman. The music is uninteresting in all aspects, repetitious for no reason, and extremely dull to the ears.-I wonder how much money he got for getting the Baltimore Symphony to play it? I think Daugherty composed this, most definitely using only a sequencer, ...over-orchestrated it, and then stuck on a title, probably from an encyclopedia of pop-culture that sits at his desk."
3,Decent,I have played many of the other barbie games and I must say this was one of the better ones. Though it wasn't my favorite game I think that any seven or eight year old would like it.The game starts with Annika in the cloud kingdom and ends where she frees her parents. The games are pretty easy and the dialouge is about what you would expect from a barbie game. My younger sister enjoyed it but she liked Barbie Diaries: High School Mystery and Barbie Princess and the Pauper much better.
1,History of 114th NY Infantry Regiment,"Never got to see it - - the cover said 114th Regiment, but the complete insides was of another NY Regiment. Too bad that nobody checked the contents before it was printed/received/paid for/ordered/shipped. Perhaps I am the only checker in the chain. I still want the 114th history - if it's really, really that."
4,Hidden Destination,"A stunning expository of an unfamiliar topic. Brennan describes the events in the life of a Romainian fugitive with breathtaking descriptions of a crumbling post-communistic society. This true story piques the interest of the reader in a relm of reality that is often overlooked in our comfortable American lives. Details Romainian dictator, Choukesku, overthrow with clear-cut accruacy. Simply amazing. Truly a high caliber biography for the adventure seeking reader."
1,Mish-mash of theories,"1.5 stars.TAB is a collection of (often unrelated) theories and areas of research that are supposed to support the theory of an advanced, pre-glacial civilization in Antartica (when it was much further north) that influenced later cultures in Africa, Europe, and the Americas. There's nothing origional here; it's a restatement of the works of others with which you're probably already at least partially familiar. At times, the book is tedious and technical but, since the author is pretty much preaching to the choir, that probably doesn't matter too much.Not recommended."
3,"o.0 Interesting, but...","I found the book interesting in its mentionings of Dr. Hapgood and Werner. The historical aspects of this novel are interesting, although not as much so.There are gaps in their arguements, but wouldn't dismiss everything they have to say. I find the theory of an ancient civilization on Antarctica to be intriguing. There isn't a lot of proof to say otherwise either. Even if there isn't a civiliztion under the miles of ice over Antarctica, I strongly feel there are potentials for another (several other) species (or the ilk) and believe it would be an interesting place to search.Otherwise, a number of arguments I do find somewhat stretched (albiet interesting)."
5,My best book on Ancient Mysteries,I can honestly say that I found this book gripping. The authors researched everything excellently and the way it was set out was perfect. It was wonderful how they managed to sort out all the many bits of research by hundreds of other authors and single out the most important relevant to Atlantis. I shall be reading this book again and again and plan to buy several of the other books mentioned in this one. Bravo to the authors!
5,Worth Waiting For,"Worth Waiting ForAnother jewel full of original research from Rand Flem-Ath. His first book WHEN THE SKY FELL (a concise classic) was the first in the surge of popular ancient history books and provided a lot of fuel for other books and a lot of food for thought. I enjoyed Wilson and Flem-Ath's friendly style and although radical in many of its ideas the book deftly delivers its points without undue sensationalism or self-aggrandisement on the part of the authors. There is always the sense of being invited along on the journey of discovery and whether its the fascinating account of the lost opportunity to make Giza the location of the prime meridian and possible buried jungle cities or the speculations (and detailed measurements for those who want to examine it themselves) about the 'blueprint' and the evidence of an ancient worldwide grid, THE ATLANTIS BLUEPRINT has been worth waiting for."
3,Good in parts,"Some of this material is questionable and other parts are really interesting. The section on the Shroud of Turin is good. Anyone who takes the works of that old Christian wishful thinker, Ian Wilson seriously does not have many facts. The only serious, scientific explanation for the Shroud comes from Knight and Lomas' book, The Second Messiah. They also agree that it is the image of Jaques de Molay. This thesis sounds odd but it fits all the fknown facts as well as being entirely probable. Anyone who says it is Jesus has a lot of hard facts to ignore and even more wishful thinking to pump in."
2,Wading through hodge podge to get to an interesting ending.,"This book is an almost absolute waste of time (and money). The cover lists Wilson and Flem-Ath as authors, but it seems like Wilson does most of the writing and that large part of the book is just a bunch of stuff that reads as if it has LITTLE-TO-NO relevance to the topic of the title. In fact, the only interesting part is Rand Flem-Ath's ending to the book. This ending talks about external layers of the earth rapidly sifting around its core to cause a quick planet wide destruction, and is used as a possible mechanism for a catastrophe that wiped out an ancient advanced civilization and almost all of humanity as well. However, that part isn't big enough to make a text book but just only a chapter :-("
1,wilson on the downard spiral,"""the atlantis blueprint"" is good reading if you're in the mood for some h.p. lovecraft dressed up as non fiction, but if you want something actually historical and objective, look elsewhere. why does wilson insist on slow intellectual suicide with these kind of nonsensical and cranky books when he is such a basically brilliant and passionately driven thinker? he is not a charlatan, as the orthodoxy would have us believe, but he isn't exactly einstein either when it comes to critical intelligence....it is a sort of derangement of the senses as rimbaud advocated where wilson deranges his own perceptions using cranky books and topics that have no relevance whatever?"
1,Put it in the Fantasy section,Come on...! Why is this book listed under science? This stuff is just more psuedo-scientific babble dressed up as something new. Could not get through it. The American public drifts toward increasing irrationality and this book is an example of it.
1,nope -no results,Save your money on this one and just get lutein caplets. I saw no difference after two boxes of this.
5,Great bear jewelry,A really nice piece of bear jewelry from the well crafted pewter bear claw pendant to the adjustable cord. It's a nice size without being ostentatious and has a nice weight to it. Looks good when dressed up or dressed down.
3,looking for bear paw jewelry,"There are few sources for realistic and quality ""silver"" jewelry that represent bear paws for me. I was disappointed that this piece was not sterling. It is a bit coarse in fabrication (which is fine, since it will not be worn as ""fine jewelrey"", but I was expected a somewhat smaller pendant in precious metal. I'm happy to wear it, but would definitly NOT recommend the cheap leather cord that comes with it. I removed it and purchased a rubber cord with silver crabclaw clasp, and I'm much happier. Overall, it's a fun piece to wear, and a good conversation starter when folks want to ask if I'm a bear hunter, which I am. Then the stories begin to flow.............."
3,So-so.,"What can I say? The characters are likeable. The story is cute. But on the whole, it's not up to Ms. Mansfield's usual standards."
3,"He loves me, he loves me not","The story between Lord Ainsworth and Kate Rendell wasn't very detailed. It mostly consisted of missed meanings and abrupt depatures. However, seeing the two characters interact was intruiging. On the other hand, a supporting character, Dierdre, detracted from the story with her flightiness. Dierdre's wandering crushes and engagements stole the thunder from the rest of the story and left Kate almost shoved out of the spotlight.Some parts of the book were enjoyable but overall the book was found lacking.It is a good way to spend some time relaxing without having to think."
2,Is it just me?,"Davina is often mentioned among ""neo soul"" greats like Amel, Badu, Angie Stone, and her stellar former label mate, Adriana Evans. I don't hear it. She paints wonderful lyrical pictures, but vocally she's just okay. The musical production, while solid, is predictable and sometimes repetitive. It's not a BAD album, but in the arena she plays in, she's a lightweight."
4,I agree -- this is outstanding,"I just pulled this out of my collection after several years, and it's HOT. I'll be grooving to it all over again. If you're into R&B/Soul, a la Eryka Badu, give this a try."
3,Solid Debut 10 Years Ago,"Davina came out with this joint in 1998. It's now 2008 and I let a buddy of mine listen to this, and she's a music reviewer for several esteemed publications and she dug it. She said a friend had it back in the day, so she remembered a couple of radio hits, but nothing more.Meanwhile I've been grooving to this solid debut CD for ten years. Just about every woman who's spent any considerable time at my place has heard it and it never fails. Everyone likes it. The CD is mostly mid-tempo burners snuggled between lust and love.The women are all gone, but ten years later I still have Davina to keep me warm..."
5,The Most Slept On Artist (and I'm getting sick of it),"I fill radio stations DJ's should be hung from there broadcast towers for not giving this girl the airplay she deserves. This is one of first R&B artist that I enjoyed the entire CD even the video and remixes. I put her in a catagory with Sade', Grenique, Badu, Maxwell....etc. Very jazz felt album, old school r&b feel. To many original good artist are not getting there props because of what wack radio DJ's think is good music. Davina, N'Dambi and other great artist are making great music and no one knows unless they make a video or have a underground radio station in there area. big up to Davina..... ONE"
5,It's a shame,she didn't make more albums. I bought this when it was first released and couldn't believe it wasn't a smash. Very smooth and sensual...
4,Supplement For Prescribed Medication,"I have only recently starting taking this supplement for chronic stomach discomfort. I am coming off of the prescribed medications and tolerating this supplement well. Hopefully, I will eventually be off of the prescribed medication 100%!"
5,Big help to those who suffer from malabsorbtion,I was surprised by size bottle for such little price. I was paying the price for 4oz bottle
2,Probably snake oil,"I bought this crap for my Dad. He's on the ""Sucker"" mailing list so he gets literature all the time for miracle cures. He used to swear by Noni Juice, he spent $50 on power balance bracelets and he will take any vitamin pill if someone tells him it will be good for him. I have lost track of all the miracle cures he has bought over the years.Somebody mailed him a letter stating all the benefits of Swedish Bitters and accompanied an order form with this letter. For $40 a 10oz bottle he could be cured of what ails him. Just like Noni Juice, Mona Vie, and every other snake oil product out there this stuff promised the same biblical healing properties. He hasn't inquired about buying anymore of this stuff and its been well over a year since I gave him this bottle so I guess its not doing anything for him."
4,Potent & Effective,"Swedish Bitters was recommended at a reliable health products store for ""promoting regularity."" The package says 1-2 tsp per day so I started with 1/2 tsp and it was too effective! Be careful with dosage and start slowly. The results are quick, like within an hour or two. I'd like to find more literature about long term use but google didn't turn up anything substantive."
1,frustrating design,"Neat idea, but frustrating design. When freeze alarm beeps you must press a certain button to stop it. When it sounds in middle of night it is difficult to find that specific button. Be nice if it had a ""silent"" mode. If you do press the wrong button, you have reset it--which is not a simple button click. You have to unscrew the back and reset the transmitter unit as well. Not worth it."
2,Dr. Friedricks Guppe Wireless Thermometer,"I only today received this item so I have no long term experience to report. However, the description refers to the capability to use 3 transmitters but neither the data furnished with my purchase nor anything I have been able to locate gives me enough information to allow me to purchase another transmitter."
2,Infernal Beeping,"If you live in a tropical climate than you are ok, but if you live where the temperature dropps below 40'F don't buy this product. The ice warning is a infernal high pitched beeping which sets off the glass break alarms on my security system. There is no stopping the beep. It is a ""built in feature"". You have to ""destroy"" the speeker to get it to stop. Don't get this product. I would suggest the other version that doesn't beep. Other than this it is a pretty accurate (sometimes off a little) but other than that it works well."
4,Did a pretty nice job,This polishing set brought back a good deal of life to a stainless sink that was about 2 years old. If you have a very old sink or one with deep or significent scratches I don't think this is going to get it.
1,Siege 63001 stainless steel sink and cookware scratch remover,"After using this product not only were the scratches not removed there were new ones.I had high hopes for this product, but found that Barkkeepers friend does a much better job of polishing. It does not remove scratches but neither did this"
4,Stainless Steel Sink Scratch Remover,"I used this product on my stainless steel sink. It was loaded with scratches. The sink was fairly new but looked like it was over 10 years old. I tried this product and it did take out many scratches, but the sink still did not look new any more. I did feel better about my sink after using the product and plan to use it every so often when I get more scratches."
1,It's a scam!,It did not work at all. In fact it made my refrigerator doors look much worse. I had to buy new doors. Don't fall for the scam.
5,"""MAGIC""","I had no idea how well this product would work- there were no previous reviews to even make an educated guess. Well, to quote the people on the informercials: ""I was very skeptical""....However, with a double staineless steel sink SEVERELY scratched up, I thought I had little to loose, so I placed an order. I received it in a very timely manner. Most importantly, the process WAS NOT COMPLICATED OR PROTRACTED- easy to follow instructions that actually made sense!To make a long story short, the end result is a double sided stainless steel sink that does indeed look brand new!!!!!$25 bucks ( including shipping ) well spent."
4,Not bad!,"I was pleasantly surprised to see the scratches in my sink slowly disappearing with every level of sandpaper I used. It takes a bit of finess to keep your hand and arm going straight and accuate with the grain of the stainless for hundreds and HUNDREDS of strokes (and that's if you start on the green level 4 and work your way down - more if you start on level 6 for the deeper scratches). I would suggest just stopping if your arm gets tired and come back to it later; otherwise you start cutting corners trying to use different arm muscles and then the pattern gets off. But the bottom line is that although it's a lot of work, the products work well. I would recommend this to friend."
3,Helped a little,"Helped the appearance of my stainless steel kitchen sink a little, but not a fantastic result."
2,?,"Let start off by saying I'm a huge Jodeci fan, and I support all of them, but I don't know about Dalvin's album. My favorite cuts on the album are ""Why Can't We, Long Day, More Than Friends(dope) and Not my Girl"". The main problem is that Dalvin doesn't have a real good voice and should know his limitations. Some songs sound good, others sound like Sh%t. I still looking for the Jodeci album."
2,Not up to par,"I have to admit, I was really looking forward to this album. As a huge fan of Jodeci, I always thought Dalvin was a looker but had no idea if he actually had any talent. Unfortunately, I have to say that he doesnt. The album is bland and dull, and has a generic sound. Nothing really stood out to me. I was extremely disappointed!"
1,Now We Know Why He Didn't Sing w/ Jodeci,"This album is horrible. I'm a huge Jodeci fan, and unfortunately Dalvin can't sing, nor can he write good songs. This lyrics on this album are so wack, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Dalvin should of at least let DeVante write and produce more than one song, since DeVante has more talent in his left pinky than Dalvin has in his whole body. Don't waste your money on this."
3,For a friend,For wife's friendDon't have any additional info to add about this product - it served it's purpose for me.
3,This book was not as helpful as I had hoped,I only partially read this book. It was not as helpful as I had hoped. Maybe too many personal details where general information may have been more appropriate for me.
5,Manual for Widows,"This is the first book I got about being a widow. It has been my ""go to"" book whenever I think I'm going insane and that I think no one could possibly understand. ""For Widows Only"" touches on about every thought, experience and feeling that is related to being a widow...I don't feel so lost, unsure and crazy anymore because of this book."
5,Can't wait for the novel!,"As a Gay Rodeo contestant this book brought tears to my eyes more than a few times. I particularly enjoyed the element of family support (biological and non-biological) that this book so many times pointed out. It also brought to light the fact that even in the most remote locations there are gay people! Unfortunately, these folks are often pushed out of those lovely communities and into cities where they long for the simple lives they knew as children and young adults.I would like to see the characters expanded. The ending seemed rushed and not what I had expected. I sure hope the author will consider turning this into a novel and expanding the story lines and developing these characters more.For the first time in my life there is a book writen about something that I can not only relate to, but can feel, taste, smell and see. So much of what the author captured is true about gay rodeo.I can't wait for the novel or the movie."
4,One of the best albums I have received as a gift,"I was given this CD as a gift. I wasn't really expecting much as it is very difficult for people to truly to anticipate what I will like. However I found this to be a beautiful, evocative and haunting album. Elvis Costello's rendition of When That I was and a Little Tiny Boy is simply beautiful and is a song I can listen to again and again. Mistress Mine is also very good. Some of the music will transform you to an older time and some is strikingly different and new. Be prepared for an unusual experience, well worth buying."
4,Stern's Play Breaks Stern Rut,"Jazz guitar fans often find Stern frustrating: he has great jazz chops and credentials, but he often gives in to the clichés and riffs of the rock guitar hero. His tunes have tended toward the following formula: quirky, upbeat head, long solo culminating with rock and roll flash muscle-moves. Play breaks this pattern. The signature Stern heads are there, but he seems to consciously be trying to avoid his more familiar rock riffs in order to try out more adventurous harmonic ideas. The additions of Scofield and Frisell are interesting--there are not the typical ego collisions one finds on multiple-star guitar projects. They all push each other and there is a genuine sense of good fun and play in the tunes. Bottom line: if you'd gotten sick of Stern, like I had, try out Play. He's doing something different here."
5,Stern has finally arrived!,"Mike Stern was in danger of becoming one of music's great enigmas. His talent and potential have always been apparent, but over the years his music had become static. With the realease of his new CD ""Play"" Stern has taken a giant leap into and above the mundane world of his contemporaries. This is truly an amazing pioneering event for the world of jazz. It is music that is completely new and fresh. If you buy one album this year, this is the one! Congradulations Mike, you're one of the biggest kids now!"
1,Does not have Ferrite rings.,"Although the technical specifications mention that the cable has ferrite rings, the product that shipped did not have any ferrite rings."
1,useless,"this cable is no capable of doing what it's suppose to do, so don't waste your money on it. You will not be able to watch HD movies nor HD tv using this cable is not good enough to connect anything to a HDTV, it sucks."
1,"Low Quality, Would not recommend","I thought I was getting a great deal on this product since it seemed so much cheaper than all of alternatives. However, be warned. This product will not last terribly long.The product lasted me just a few months before lines started appearing on my 22"" LCD HDTV. At first I thought it was the TV, and I didn't suspect the cable, but then I realized that I had to wiggle the cable for it to work. At first wiggling was fine, but it got annoying when the TV would stop being recognized by my computer and then I'd have to wait for the TV to be re-recognized and then for everything to settle again. I ended up purchasing a $20 DVI to HDMI cable made by Belkin since the original product was past warranty. The Belkin cable has has been awesome since. It's definitely worth a few extra bucks for a quality cable that will survive even a little movement and bending."
4,A bit dated,"In its time, I'm sure this offered timely information. Probably other resources are better at this point in Quicktime history."
5,You are there!!!,This recording captures Wynton's live performance in an intimate setting as if you were seated third row center. Don't let others convince you that the audience gets in the way of the performance. This is pure give and take-between musicians and listeners. This is a true jazz experience as close as you'll get without being present at the recording.
4,Vintage Wynton - and he shines so bright,"This recording certainly isn't as polished as ""The Magic Hour"" (highly recommended, by the way) but there sure is a lot of fun documented here. The opening track is on fire. Explosive. If only all the tracks were as strong. In fact, the album tends to lose the fire as the songs come to an end - but don't let that discourage you. For the most part - it's a good live recording. The sound quality is top notch. Highly enjoyable if you like the traditional jazz scene..."
2,Warmed-over leftovers,"Here Wynton looks back at jazz history and does so with such reverance (deserved or not) that he squeezes the life out of these pieces. Are these passable renditions of these six works? Yeah. Do they add anything to the repertory? No.The one piece here that swings a bit is Bird's ""Donna Lee"".If you're into mellow, slow-tempo balads, then this CD is for you. However for live Wynton at his best, I suggest his seven CD ""Live at the Village Vanguard"". A real contribution the jazz repertory and a worthwhile investment."
1,"Sorry, dreadful recording","I have tried and tried, but this disc is dreadful. I have seen Wynton live 5 times, and he was alway great. Not sure how they could have picked this night. Off."
3,Product description is misleading,"Only if you purchase ""Daylite Mail Integration"" does Daylite integrate with Apple Mail. This product DOES NOT integrate with Apple Mail as a stand alone. Daylite Productivity Suite ($189) does, but not Daylite 3 alone.The product description is misleading as written. The fact that DMI is not advertised as a ""frequently purchased together"" option reinforces the deception (albeit unintended, I am sure).BUYER BEWARE!Let me add also, that while the promise of Daylite is great, and even more so, with the addition of an iphone extension, the setup and execution of this app across even a small LAN is extreme. EVERY desktop must be set up as a separate exercise and the extent of every setup can be hundreds of dollars. The learning curve is extraordinary. This product is anything but plug and play.BUYER BEWARE!"
2,"Good idea, but needs a LOT of work.","Daylite3 is a great idea for CRM software. I like how it integrates with mail client. That being said, make sure to back up often. This is a small company and it really should be labeled as a beta product. I experience errors left and right, whether it's duplicating con acts, duplicating organizations or simply deleting information. Thankfully after many horrific incidents, I have been able to recover.In addition, it's important to note that while their product Syncs with Mail and Address book, it doesn't sync with iPhone or iCloud, so if you want your contacts and calendars synced you have to buy Daylite touch, which only syncs when on the same wi-fi network.Daylite has potential to be great, but be warned this will behave like beta software, I have spent hours upon hours recovering contacts and trying to fix issues."
3,Overkill if you are not sharing your data with others,"I've been using DL3 for half a year in a one-man-business setting. It is powerful, inter-linking contacts and notes and appointments, pipeline, activity set, server database, huge posibilites. But I found myself always clicking around too much to find my stuff, instead of actually working....Might work perfectly if you are working in a sales team.NorbertAnyone interested in a buying a licence code? [...]"
2,Daylite - Always the last application to work with a system upgrade.,"I have been using Daylite now for almost two years. The program does allow an organization to manage it's contact database and sales pipeline at an individual level. Getting a report out of it that provides any intelligence is tricky at best. If you have lots of time to spend figuring it out or cash to pay a consultant (value added reseller) then you will be okay.Note that you will always be the last to convert to any new feature launched by Apple. Generally it takes months before this application will push an update out that's useful. And if you ask Merchant Circle about it... it is always Apple's problem. They didn't do this, They didn't tell us that... whatever.Do yourself a big favor. Choose a different application. I have spent thousands on this application and support for a 2 sales person deployment. Most days I would be better off with a simple spreadsheet.Good luck."
1,WARNING! WARNING!,"To make a long story, that extends over years short: I now can't even open up a database anymore that I have developed over a long time. Every upgrade with this software was a nightmare, and whenever I changed computers it was a disaster, and now it's all gone, won't even open up anymore. I also had their mail plug in. Even a year after the last use, their mail plug in (even though I uninstalled it) keeps tagging one of my contacts randomly in the addressbook when I send out an email. Their contact name appears as the sender. No way to fix it. I don't understand that this company still exists. It's downright criminal, what they do."
1,Waste of the trees,"I read this book as part of a women's leadership bookclub - unanimously we all agreed we found the book superficial, frivolous and a waste of the paper it was printed on. We were looking for Dowd to not just collect snippets of stories and drop names of all the New York socialites she knows. The book lacks any real substance and rarely offers anything more than a collection of pop culture tid bits."
5,A voice for all women who have been made to feel guilty for their succcesses,"Maureen Dowd's voice speaks to me in the darkness of a lonely place, one where men are terrified of women who are successful on their own terms. She made me feel better about everything that has haunted me. She does not provide solutions (alas, as she, like the rest of us uppity women, has none) for the battle of the sexes, unless that solution is simply that we should keep on being the people we have the gifts and the resolve to be.I love Maureen's voice. I want to be her friend and talk to her about these problems the way she has talked to me.If you are a woman who frightens men without being rude or cruel, buy this book. Maureen Dowd is talking to you."
2,"Maureen, you can do better. You have done better.","Maureen Dowd is great when she dissects the misdeeds of the Bush and Cheney families, families which show arrogance and ignorance as their chief characteristics. But here she gets into the sterile and overdone nonsense about the battle of the sexes. Sex is inteesting but the battle between feminists and anti-feminists is not. She is slightly amusing here, especially when she talks about herself and her Irish family, but the overall topic is a bore. I hope she will return to the political realm."
1,Nagging By Any Other Name,"Yikes, even Maureen Dowd being too smart for all men is our fault too.I love smart women. I'm not threatened by them, I seek them out, I get burned for my efforts. It's not a sex thing, it's an overall human insanity and I accept it.But nobody likes women who regularly remind us they're smarter than all men. And that it's also the fault of men that there aren't more smart women. And George Bush is evil. Yadda, yadda, yadda. I'm sorry, were you saying something...?"
3,"a better title would have been ""Are We Not Men?""","I enjoyed Maureen's book. It was an amusing, thought-provoking read. BTW, we're all Devo."
2,Being Necessary all depends on the woman,"This book is a big disappointment because it is a flimsy argument. Men are as necessary to women as women are to men, to say otherwise is a foolish thing."
3,Good but not great,"This is another good book about relationships;, why don't they happen? Why don't they work? etc. Some good anecdotes but a re-hash of 'He's Just Not That...' in places, particularly on dating. I still say you gain more insight from a good fictional novel (You Are Here ( Steve Horsfall); The Other Woman (Jane Green) etc) than you do from pure observational commentaries."
1,People actually pay to read this stuff?,"Cutsey, vapid, airheaded.Who is fool enough to pay for this?PT Barnum WAS right."
1,Feminist twaddle,"Are men necessary?If Dowd and her coven of acolytes (the ones giving this book five stars) don't want to go back to shivering in a cave trying to digest grasshoppers and grubs, the answer is: Yes."
1,Is ANYONE Necessary?,"That's a totally irrelevant question and book title. No one is necessary; because God made man and woman for his own pleasure and desire. We're here because God wanted us here. Plain and simple. Secondly, women would not exist on the earth without men. No women ever born on the earth got here without a man. The first person on earth was a man and everyone else came from him."
3,"Starts OK, gets lost","Marjorie Dowd is a well-known newspaper essayist who tackles the field of women's roles in the world. Basically, it seems that the book, while enjoyable, is a series of anecdotes without cohesion. By the last 25 pages I gave up on finding any good overall theme. I agree with the premise (to some degree!!) but do feel that men have SOME role in society."
2,Walking Around Reality and the Y Chromosome.,"For the general audience, this book should prove a good read. For a feminist, however, it is compiled rhetoric, strung together with no compelling insights that I can recall. As for the waning of the Y chromosome, this data has been publicly available for some time.The title is obviously meant to provoke. Of course men are necessary - to create the tension that keeps the blood coursing through our veins, at the very least."
1,Thank goodness that I borrowed this book...,"Poor Ms. Dowd. She's a cliche ridden hack who manages to string together a bunch of old fables and call it original. To say that her critics are intimidated by her intelligence and independence is merely using ad hominem attacks to avoid basing their support on any objective data.While there is much precedent in picking a ""controversial"" title to improve sales, Ms. Dowd has taken a rather dubious low road. I can just imagine the scathing comments in her NYT column about the sexist reactionary if someone had written a book titled ""Women, Hormone-driven non-thinkers.""Just for the record, my wife is a retired executive and my daughter finishes her electrical engineering degree this May."
2,Two Stars for Maureen our Aging Little Cupcake,"If you want to read about about a whiney over the hill woman who can't hold on to a man because he's ""not good enough for her"", then read this one. My suggestion is that it should be required reading upon high school graduation for all students. Boys, if you come across a ball breaker like Maureen ""HEAD FOR THE HILLS"". Girls, if you think men are going to find your sarcasm as an attractive quality then ask yourselves how much you like sarcasm directed at you. She's single for a reason. She hasn't figured out that along with being intelligent, wealthy, and reasonably attractive you still have to be ""nice"".If you want a lonely life then follow in Maureen's footsteps. My suggestion is read the first chapter in the book store, skim the rest of the book, put it back and save your money."
1,Is Dowd Wanted?,"Dowd is famously lazy hence the nickname the ""cut and paste columnist"" but even by her lazy standards this is really a record. She takes one tired genralization wounded around gossip thickened with embittered personal experience add to battered ego (Yeah, we got it. We know you're hot Maureen)and ergo a book. If you get it for free, ok; if you have to pay move on to something of substance like Katha Pollit or Jamie Jamieson."
5,Great book,Like Bushworld this is an excellent book full of witty observations and one of the best I have read in a long time. Amazing how many men are threatened by this book. Ross is particularly pitiful. If you had a little more confidence in yourself you all wouldn't be so pathetic about it and I doubt many of you have actually read the book. Maybe it's the fact that Dowd is one of the hottest and smartest women around that scares you so much.
1,nope,why can't maureen dowd find a man? look at a picture of her. add that to her hippie pseudo-intellect and you get a spinster.
1,Men are way more necessary than women!!,I don't care what Maureen Dowd says women do not make better leaders then men it's the other way around. She comes from another planet thinking in the future women will have all the power. Maureen is not funny at all.
1,Why all the interviews?,"I received the book as a gift and eagerly anticipated reading it after hearing a blitz of Dowd interviews on Charlie Rose, npr and other talk shows. I was disappointed with the level of writing, the depth of the thought process and the general whining. The Sunday Times magazine presented a good short article on the subject by Dowd, but this never deserved more than a few pages. Deadly. Didn't Rose and NPR even read the book? What were they thinking?"
2,Are bourgeois women really necessary?,"What happens when a professional man-hater enters her 6th decade alone and childless? Some women would seek therapy or fall back on introspection, but, when a woman's income depends on peddling misandry to like minded women, a change in attitude could lead to the unemployment line. It much easier, and more profitable, to write a book condemning men who have decided to vote with their feet. Corporate spinsters who stalk the halls in shoulder pads and charge men with sexual harassment will love this book. Others may not."
1,Is Reading This Book Necessary?,"The latent hostility to men that permeates this book is evident in the title. No need to read the book to know why it's author is not married. A more interesting topic would be why so much sexist trash is tolerated from ""feminist"" writers."
1,Short-sighted,"Don't waste your time. I rarely give one star ratings, but this book is shallow observation and nothing more."
1,superfluous author,"Men who read this book and praise the author and her 'work' are making her point - men are superfluous. With the rotten attitude the author displays toward men, is it any wonder men in her life seem to find her superfluous?"
1,Nobody Cares,"Maureen Dowd was never that attractive and, if you want to date men, don't be a jerk. She's an angry jerk. Angry that men were never going to fawn over her since she always vastly overrestimated her intelligence and her physical appearance. She's ""OK"", but no real catch and she comes with baggage, lots of baggage. Now she's old, with lots of baggage. No man with means, an education, income, assets and a career would've ever wasted their time with her. It's that simple. They don't want the anger, the vitriol, the bitterness, the shrill attacks, the histrionics or the irrationality of her logically inconsistent arguments. Who needs it. She wrote her own obituary when she wrote this book and no man in his right mind would've ever treated their ""relationship"" with her as anything more than casual sex, at her place, so he can leave without having to listen to her. Lol"
2,Don't be duped by the cover-this is not an interesting book.,"She uses a lot of well-articulated stereotypes. Even a 50's housewife would gag. She assumes that all men are superficial and are attracted to bimbos and that all women fill that role. She hates men but then desperately wants their approval. She wrote a chapter about how female heads of state are superior than male heads of state, then doesn't list a single female head of state. (FYI-Benazir Bhutto,Margaret Thatcher, Angel Merkel, etc).She asks one or two of her friends their opinions on social patterns of men and women and then she tries to use it as a reliable statistic that explains everything. High school students can produce better data than that, as well as more coherent thesis'.The only redeemable aspect of this abomination was her writing style. Insipid, hackneyed, prejudiced, but oddly witty. This book is like a more expensive and irritating version of Cosmo."
2,"I'm no liberal basher, but Dowd is the lefty Ann Coulter","I'm not sure why Ms. Dowd is so popular. I suppose it is because there are so many people in this country who want their worldview confirmed and not challenged. And the ""problems"" discussed in this book apply to only .5% of the world's women. Day after day in the NY Times, Ms. Dowd never says anything enlightening. She takes shots at people with comical turns of phrase, but just like the content of this book she doesn't really propose any new ideas or astute analysis in my opinion at least. But good for her she's made a career out of this stuff."
1,"It is content free, I could not remember what she had to say","I read about 1/4 of this book, and then realized, there was nothing of substance she was saying. Yes, there were witicisms and turns of phrase, but overall this was LIGHTweight prose and certainly no coherent theme. Imagine many of her articles strung together. I turned pages thinking SOMETHING was building, some lancing intellectual blow would be struck, an irrefutable point would be made -- about something. But no, it was like another column started about the same time as the warm afterglow of the last ended.What a shame, what a waste. How transient and empty. Too bad since I always thought she had much to offer. And as long as it is column length, she does. But not a book, please, Maureen, spare us...no more books!"
2,jumbled collection of observations and randomly collected statistics,"Dowd's writing style (sharp, witty, and spot-on, though often superficial) is best suited to her columns and 10 minute guest spots on TV shows. The impression I got from the book was that it was reminiscent of a long conversation you might have with friends about gender and American society, though I suspect it would be much more interesting to have that conversation spontaneously rather than read hundreds of pages about it. The most interesting part of the book for me was the end section about Hillary Clinton and whether she sold out feminism by standing by her man and if our society can only stomach ballsy women if they've been ""humanized"" (i.e., humiliated) by personal problems/scandals. Overall, this book has been hyped way too much, probably because the title is provocative, though it's clear that Dowd is not a manhater by any means."
2,Eh.,Not much here that hasn't been said better somewhere else. Try Ariel Levy's Female Chauvinist Pigs or even Naomi Wolf's The Beauty Myth for more in-depth discourses on some of the ideas that Dowd skips along the surface of.
2,Who cares whether the reviewers are men or women?,"Yes, some men who read this book will be annoyed by the title. But the title is annoying! It's polemic and the answer is so obvious. It is really sad that this is what is counted as feminist prose. As another reviewed said the book purports to speak about issues but it dissolves into bad writing with no style, filled with inane personal anecdotes. In a word, BORING. Dowd needs a good editor more than a date."
2,Conflict Sells,"While I agree with some of what Dowd writes, I also think it's an affinity of American media to capitalize on (and sometimes exaggerate) conflict and difference. I'm all for equality, but I find it interesting that some feminists aren't just interested in a fair shake, they're interested in putting men down and asserting superiority. In fact, I personally know a few women who have bigger egos than the most men (and yes, that's a bit of a turn-off). There are also those who decry stereotypes, but then turn around and apply them to others.Regarding the trouble many successful women apparently have getting a man or getting married: It may be that the more successful women are, the smaller their pool of potential candidates (because many tend to ""marry up""), but the same could apply to women who prefer men of equal socio-economic status. Sometimes there's a little more to the stats than meets the eye."
1,My issue,"If Maureen Dowd wants to write a tongue-in-cheek book to argue from a cultural point of view, that men are unnecessary, I would have no problem. But she tries to pass her ""insights"" as being pseudo-science. She tries to somehow amalgate declining Y chromosomes as some sort of scientific evidence that males are dying out, with anti-male propaganda. Feminism is just fine, and powerful women are just fine, but writing against males for anti-male's sake is just offensive.As a man who supports feminism and the power of women to choose their lifestyle, I'm offended by this book. This does not nothing to advance the cause of gender equality. how could it...the title itself is a jab at the male sex! What equality is that?"
2,I thought it was a real book,"and I bought the hardcover. Now I'm sorry. I am not intimidated by the question, Are Men necessary? I just thought it was going to be a serious book that actually addressed that issue. So I read the first 50 pages, wondering when it was going to get real, when I realized that the entire book is a sad attempt at comedy. Most of her examples refer to the made-up world of movies or literature. As for the rest of her source material, all I can say is that this woman must live in a very differant world from me. I've never met anyone like the people she refers to. Either she is going for hyperbole or else she lives in a very isolated and superficial world.So, the book is mildy amusing if you are looking for comedy, but don't be fooled into thinking she actually addresses any real issues."
2,She Just Couldn't Help Herself,"Ms. Dowd tells us at the beginning of her book that: ""This book is not a systematic inquiry of any kind."" She was right on point with that remark. While her writing is excellent, and her intelligence cannot be challenged, her ability to stay on subject left a lot to be desired. And, her far-left liberal bent found its way onto her pages over and over again. It just seems to me if you are going to write a book about the sexes and whether ""men are necessary,"" then I think you should at least give the reader a more in-depth analysis on the information which the title of the book led them to believe they were going to get."
5,Canon Printhead,Item was as described and worked perfectly right out of the package. Very fast shipping.
4,Fixed my clogged nozzle problem,Got the part on-time and at a great price.It cleared my poor print quality issue from the old original print head. I vow to never use refilled cartridges again.
3,Perfect except...,"Okay, delivery was fast, (two days), the printhead fits and works well, no problems. So why only three stars?The box is marked ""Not returnable if the box is opened"".I guess you're supposed to use magic to find out if the unit is good without opening the box and actually installing it..."
1,Too Expensive,"I didn't buy this print head based on the other reviews. Thank you. $80.00 is just way too much for this item. Other sites advertise the same item for under $60.00 and nothing about ""refurbished."" I did however go back to my HP printer, flawless operation and much cheaper to operate. I've purchased my last Canon product."
5,Cannon QY6-00059 Printhead for MP530,I'm so happy that I was able to find this Printhead. My printer is six years old but was working perfectly until the Printhead died. I was having problems finding one & when I finally did it was more expensive. So Amazon came to the rescue. Not only did I get my Printhead but it was less expensive. I'm glad to have extended the life of my Printer. To me six years is not old.
3,A picture history of the Douglas-Vespa relationship only.,"The title of the book is decieving for while the archival pictures are quiant, this is not a diffinative historical picture filled book on the Vespa. It's a pictorial book about the Douglas Motorcycle companies relationship with Vespa, nothing else. There are basic attempts to detail what happened in the two companies history and the models that were produced but it isn't what the title makes it out to be. Buy it if you just want to know more triva, not for hard core data like you would want to know on specific models Vespa made and when they made them."
5,"Great book, but beware: only covers Douglas Vespas (UK)","That's a great looking book with very interesting B&W pictures. Not much text but the essential nonetheless and every picture has a detailed informative legend (96 pages). But important: THIS BOOK COVERS ""DOUGLAS"" (MADE IN THE UK) VESPA HISTORY ONLY. A ""must have"", I think."
2,Does NOT support MP3s,"The player feels unusually cheaply made, but the real show-stopper is that it does not support MP3s in any way. The product's documentation makes no mention of MP3 support, but as of the date of this review the product page on Amazon still lists MP3 playback. I purchased it over other models specifically because of this feature, but was disappointed when it arrived. GPX does make some higher-end portable players with MP3 support, but this model isn't among them."
1,Tiny Sound No Bass Reinforcement,"I regret buying this Boombox. It has tiny sound and the DBFB or whatever they call bass reinforcement does not provide any kick.This is a nice small radio/boombox. But to party, or enjoy some music, you need better low end support.I bought another boombox last year , a Coby I think and it was $10 more at retail and worth it.I had hoped this boombox would meet my requirements of music in the bedroom. Unfortunately it did not."
3,"could be better, could be worse","This product could be worse, but could also be better. If you want something fairly cheap and works decently, this isn't a bad choice. I works fine for my needs."
2,Dishwasher safe????,"We were given two sets of this flatware last August. By December, the handles had fallen off several of the pieces. We do use the flatware daily and it does look good with the place settings, but I had hoped for better quality."
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased this item as a gift and to my mother's disappointment, the seam on the wings unraveled after a week standing outside. The plastic wheel that hooks the wings together and allows them to spin also broke the second week. Save your money. Don't buy this item until it is improved."
4,worth every penny,"i've been a mac user for years and kept my computers around longer than pc users, so i didn't really think i needed to purchase the acpp. i pre-purchased a mini when they rolled them out and went ahead and bought the plan with it. it has been worth every penny. i dropped my pod riding my bike in the fall and couldn't get it to work again. apple replaced my pod within 3 days. also one of the reviewers said the plan is only for a year. i was under the impression the pod is covered for two years. however i purchased my plan directly from apple."
2,"Expensive, limited coverage","Considering that this policy only extends the warranty for one year, it is expensive. Coverage for the iPod's biggest problem, its battery, is vague. Apple simply defines as non-defects some apparent battery problems, such as the fact that the battery drains very rapidly when the unit is not in use and turned off. Plus, the battery can drop drastically in usage time, and Apple protects itself by saying this: ""Service coverage is available ... for battery depletion of 50 percent or more from original specification."" What other company clearly states that precipitous product failure is not covered by either the original or extended warranty?"
2,Less expensive policy available for 29.95 from Crutchfield.com,"Although this policy is thru Apple, it is 2x the price of similar policies available from other companies that also have very good reputations. One is Crutchfield.com which has a 2 yr. plan for $29.99 which starts *after* the standard Apple 1 yr labor coverage (for a TOTAL OF 3 YEARS). Apple extended warranty is a total of 2 years for $59.99, rather than a total of 3 years for $29.99 thru Crutchfield."
4,You do have to buy this with Apple products!!,"Ok, even though i am telling you have to buy this, i gave it 4 stars, and the reason is that with Apple you will need more than 1 year warranty!! Google and you will see how many problems people have with the iPods. I bought my iPod 40gb 4g on July 2004($399,00 + tax), and after 7 or 8 months it began skipping. I thought at first it was a software glitch and overlooked it. Shortly after my warranty expired (1 year) it totally stopped working, i went to the Apple store i had bought it and they told me it is a hardware problem (and they had seen a 'few' with the same problem) and it will cost me $280,00 to fix it. :(So, do yourself a favor, pay the extra, but know that if this thing breaks you won't have to pay an absurd ammount of money to fix it!!For further accounts of people's experiences with the iPods malfunctionings, go to:http://jon.blogs.com/mopho/2004/03/ipod_quirks.html"
4,An easier way to read the serial number,"I just wanted to respond to Charles Long's difficulty reading the engraved serial number off the back of the iPod. Apple does have an easier way of accessing the serial number. Just go to the Settings menu, choose About, and you'll find the s/n listed on the iPod display.That said, there's still plenty of room for improvement in Apple's AppleCare registration process, but I do recommend AppleCare for iPod -- because of the battery replacement issues, and also because the iPod is basically a very very portable hard drive."
2,Don't buy this for the battery!,"The guy at a local retail store tried to convince me I should buy this plan because all iPod batteries die within a year and a half or two years. With this plan I can supposedly get a new one for ""free"". But that only lasts 2 years. Why pay now when you might not even need a new battery within 2 years and Apple already offers an Out-of-Warranty Battery Replacement Program? From the Apple web site: ""If your iPod requires service only because the battery's ability to hold an electrical charge has diminished, Apple will replace your iPod for a service fee of $59, plus $6.95 shipping."" Just wait and spend the money when/if you need to."
1,100% waste of money,"I couldn't get them to fix a cracked screen just 2 months after purchase. No pressure was put on it, it wasn't dropped, and was in a leather case the entire time. It was a small crack in the corner (no exterior damage, of course). I'd prefer to simply set three $20 bills on fire than purchase this useless ""protection""."
4,Color deception,"I chose it over many other Zojirushi dispensing pots, because I thought it fits the color of my kitchen, but the picture doesn't do it justice. It's actually darker. I'm disappointed with the color, but I'm happy to have it, just because it's a good brand and has dechlorinated feature. In its own, it looks good. It's surprisingly light for its size. It came with an instruction book in great English and great drawings. I just got a glass pitcher with lid. I will use the pot for iced tea. Tea will taste better in glass container and will taste better with dechlorinated water. Double delicious! :D"
5,Rare and haunting,"This is perhaps the most unusual fantasy I've ever read - inventive, meaningful, compelling, and so powerful in its atmosphere that I could shut my eyes and feel myself still in Jakober's world long after I closed the book. Jakober also proves something for me: that in terms of quality, some work in so-called ""genre fiction"" is the equal or better of anything you'd find in the literary mainstream.One small correction, for the sake of fairness: a previous reviewer was incensed at Jakober's use of a real saint as a central character. In fact, she did not do that. The Reinmark and all its denizens are fictional, as noted by the author on p.459 (of my hardback). I do know a bit about the saints, and I know he ain't there - though Jakober did accurately capture the tortured psyche of some of the contemporary saints."
2,Irritating!!!,"""In this irritating, brilliant novel.."".. The character of Paul was so irritating I couldnt even finish the book. With 75% Paul, and only 25% Karelian, it was very disappointing. I adored Even The Stones by this author; this novel could have been just as great, but there was too much Paul...The pious homophobic repressed ramblings of Paul... UGH they are so tiresome. Take away the beautifully written parts involving Karelian and Raven, and you have a very dull read!"
5,Entrancing,"If I could, I would have given this book 6 stars. I haven't read such an absorbing fantasy for a long time. Excellent characterization, interesting approach to narrative, vivid magic, high drama, moral ambiguity ... It's a pity that the loose ends were tied up so well at the end, otherwise I would have liked to read a sequel. I hope that Edge Publishers in Canada follow up with more books of the same caliber."
4,Creative spin on old tales,"Interesting pictures that my four year old loved and also the funny morales, especially ""He who smelt it, dealt it."" I heard that over and over for weeks."
2,Title is the funniest thing about this Book,"My child is 4.5, maybe this book is amusing to an older child. But I think ""amusing"" is about all the book is. I was very disappointed because I was essentially bored by the books ""morals"" after only a few pages. Don't think I even have managed to read through the book, short as it is, or even to read all the morals over time -- there just isn't enough entertainment for the effort. The attraction might be the artwork and aggressive use of mixed typeface. But the humor is relatively lame often. I keep thinking that this book is a classic ""appeals to critics"" but fails to deliver educational or entertainment value. In sum, the ""idea"" of the book (offbeat ""morals"" collection) is way better than the execution."
4,Terrific - but not for children under 8...,"Just a note of caution- this book looked great to me, so I sent it to my five-year-old neice. While the stories were cute, the ""morals"" weren't really morals and it kind of sent the wrong message. The book would be better suited to a higher age group so that they ""got"" the irony and subtleties of the stories.Wonderful illustrations and great text - just a little too mature for 4-8 year olds."
5,WONDERFUL!,"I got this book for my son who is 9...over the 4-8 age reccommendation for this book. I knew it would be funny and he would enjoy it...and boy did he! The book has ""boy appeal""... and general ""ha-ha-ho-ho's"" abound. We read it the first time for laughs...we will read it again and I will encourage him to see if there is anything ""deeper"" in the stories.... He really enjoyed the pictures alot. He is at the age when at school he is only allowed to read ""chapter"" books so this was a wonderful break and fun return back to picture books. Although some of the stories did have meaning to them...Some were just fun and all the pictures were wonderful. I enjoy allowing my son to read some things for the pure pleasure and pure fun of reading...this is a perfect choice for that."
2,IT'S HELPFUL BUT THE OFFICIAL STRATEGY GUIDE IS INFINITALLY BETTER,"This book is helpful but it focus too much on the MAP ITSELF ( LIKE THE TITLE SAYS ) :) and it became a little confusing so its better to buy the official strategy guide that not only cover the map part but also the secrets, monsters and lots and lots of hints about the game."
3,"crime doesn't pay, but it can make you laugh","A comic caper in the spirit of the late Donald Westlake.Four stable, upper-middle class males have a run of bad luck in the shaky ecomony of the early 1970s. One of them decides to rob a bank, but must recruit several confederates to pull off the scheme. He casts his net to include several fellow country club members with similar money woes, and the plot and the scheme takes shape.It's a fun novel to read, there are no pretentions of great literary merit or timeless worth, but there were many instances when I has to put the book down in order to laugh, and many instances whenIi would read aloud the dialog which I found so funny [I am easily amused].Please read this novel, you will not be bored!"
4,"it's more than a book, more like a midwife for forgiveness","Within this simple text I found a wisdom for our age which still struggles with race, gender and religious diversity. In the unencumbered style of an honest journal, she weaves the stories of growing up ""black"", from the pain of ""degrees of blackness"" to the constant dance that unconsciously coreographed relations with ""white folks"". And then over and above the telling of the story, or perhaps because of it, the sweet experience of compassion, forgiveness and love begins to manifest itself...this book will stay on my nightstand for a very long time"
4,"eclectic, eclectic","This recording goes from the British Isles toIndia to China with a touch of hardcore and noise.The changes are sometimes sweet nd sometimes abrupt,and played very skillfully by Barnes and many collaborators. The recording quality sounds analogand homey but well produced. This albums is an instantindependent classic !"
3,a head-cleaning,"I cheated on the rating -- you'll either love this or put a spike through it. Over two discs and 39 fuzzed-out tracks, Henry Barnes and company swirl together Scottish, English and Indian folk themes, a little pop, a pinch of rock, and a bucket of atonal ambient noise. It's all played on tabla, Chinese piano, viola, guitars and various electronics (and what are those, bagpipes?). The disaster potential is great, but Electrosphere is free of the vanity and slapdashery that often mar soundscaping projects that know they're weird. From circular reveries like ""Forward Pipes"" to dirges like ""King of Nothing,"" this is carefully written (if simply conceptualized) and neatly played (if scratchily produced). An aural sweat lodge."
4,Delicious noise,"If you like your music buzzing with energy, and I mean literally buzzing, you should at least give this music a listen. If Jimi Hendrix and Wendy Carlos of ""Switched On Bach"" and had a child who was then sent to the Steeleye Span School of Rock & Reel, that child would play music like what you hear on ""Electrosphere"". I wish I could tag this music; however, for me it's in a category all it's own. One of my favorites!"
3,I agree- Poor Writing and Ego Ruin It,"As if we don't have enough to worry about in regards to the children of today being overmedicated...now our pets, too?! His solution to almost every problem was prescribing an antidepressant. Also, his writing of his patients' owners came across as very egotistical and condescending. Some of the stuff had merit, but it was the same thing any trainer or behaviorist would tell you to do...establish dominance, ignore bad behaviors and reward good, etc."
2,Poor Writing Gets in the Way,"This should have been a fine book, but the author's stilted prose and misuse of words on every second page nearly ruined it for me. Dodman swings wildly from overly prim writing to embarrassingly slangy, a sure sign of a bad writer.Oliver Sacks, please report to the Veterinary School!"
3,"Update the Maps, please","This is a nice, bite-sized look at the parks. Presented in a colorful fashion, the books include the official Disney park maps that look great.The problem is the maps are several years old. There is a whole ""land"" at Disney's California Adventure that isn't even represented (a Bug's Land). That land has been open since 2003!!If you're not looking for in-depth coverage this is a quick read that you may like sharing with your kids. There aren't a lot of really ""critical"" reviews, though."
3,"Great little containers.... that is, LITTLE","These are very cute containers. They work great and look great. But don't count on being able to cook enough for more than one person. You'll probably never use the medium or small dishes. (Not for cooking, anyway. Maybe for storage.) These measure 5"", 6"" and 7"" and are about 1 1/2"" deep. Use your ruler and then decide! These do not come with steamer inserts. I recommend the set from Gear if you want better steaming results."
4,must have,this item is a must have for any serious bartender plus it is a nice gadget to have in any bodies personal bar. makes you seem more sophisticated and is a great conversation piece. dont miss out on it
3,pleased with the performance & price..... BUT!!!!,"They work just as advertised; good quality, bright, and inexpensive. But the bulb was too wide and could not go in without modification to the harness. This is a fine buy if you are going to put them in a light that is not exposed to the elements, but since I had to break the seal it is not a wise choice to purchase these unless you want your headlights ect. to condensate after a wash or heavy rain."
1,Too BIG!!!,"I bought these to replace my rear Amber turning bulbs on a 2007 Toyota 4Runner, which are 7440A. This LED is so big, it doesn't go in to the hole. Simply doesn't fit."
3,Semi-happy,"The first thing I noticed was it didn't fit on my 09 Honda Civic sedan. The base fit into the harness but once I put it into the entry where the bulb is suppose to go, the orange circle was to wide to fit into the hole. The second problem was the color wasn't really amber but more of a orange-red color. The brightness is good but it will not fit 8th generation Honda Civic sedans. I ended up returning them."
1,Didnt Fit.,It looks like it would be a cool bulb but it didnt fit in my Honda. Its bigger than the bulb it replaces.
2,"javelin: A mediocre AMC car of the '60s, and ditto for this piece","My first exposure to Michael Torke was ""Color Music"" which had a fair amount of forgettable music, and one hit ""Ash"" (imagine Beethoven with a limp, or as Brahms as a horse lover). Javelin is more of the same, but with a heavy overlay of every bad John Williams sparkly effervesent phrase. (I'm writing this along with my first hearing of it, and the more I hear, the more it sounds like Color music.) Perhaps I'm being unfair, and what I know of Torke actually was created after this. IMHO, I'd avoid this cut."
3,Innocuous Music for Dangerous Times,"The 1980's are definitely over. Torke's obsessive party music doesn't speak to me, though I did feel a rush of nostalgia-laced recognition of the 80's when I listened to this disc."
1,Waste of Money,"I installed this program on my PC and it immediately began to interfere with my internet connection, causing numerous disconnects. The ""monitoring"" aspect of Power Cleaner never worked and, when I hit ctl-alt-del, it always said PC Cleaner was ""not responding"". Web addresses were left in the cache even after repeated deletions and often I got an error message saying it couldn't run while the browser was still active, even though it had been closed for several minutes."
1,A waste of money,"This bee spinwheel does not spin - it falls over in the slightest breeze. As well as the design defects, my spinwheel's ribbons were frayed and could not be reattached to the wheel."
2,GOOD INTENTIONS WERE STILL NOT ENOUGH!,"I GOT DRAWN IN BY THE TITLE, PLUS THE CURIOSITY OF SEEING FARRAH, THE HOT SECOND MEMBER OF DESTINY'S CHILD ACT. ALL-IN-ALL, IT WAS A LOW BUDGET FILM, THE ENDING WAS THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE AS THE REST WAS DRAWN OUT AND AT TIMES BORING. OH WELL, ANOTHER BAD PURCHASE!"
1,R U SERIOUS???,"I rented this movie from the Redbox with a $1 promo code so it didn't cost me anything but my gas to get to the store and bring this garbage back and about 85 minutes of my life.I want my dollar that i didn't spend back as well as my 85 minutes. This along with ""Park Day"" has to be the worst wasted usage of a video camera in the history of movies.I can't believe Tony Rock agreed to even make a cameo appearance in this. I thought he was a decent actor before I watched this.The only thing decent about this garbage that they call a movie was that the lead actress had a kute face and nice backside that they should've showed more of.Please...I can think of a whole lot more things to do with 85 minutes of your life than watch this crap.Taking a nap is one of them."
5,Nothing but awesome!!!,This sharpener works amazingly and doesn't take long at all to get your Knives razor sharp.... I do recommend this product to everyone that has a knife.. Even if you think there's no hope for it because it's so dull... This little beauty will bring it back to life I promise you!!!!
2,its ok..,"when i purchase this product i was just getting into sharpening by hand, and it did a fairly good job.. a razor's edge on two of my EDC knives, but then the plastic frame holding the diamond stones broke, i bought a second one, and with in a week it broke too. maybe i got defective ones, but its good for what it is"
2,Doesn't sharpen any of my knives,"So I bought this sharpener at the local Cabela's because I needed something to sharpen my knives (other than my parents kitchen knife electric sharpener). I've been using this for about 3 days on every knife I own and it won't sharpen a single on of them (in fact, they are duller than they were before I used this sharpener). I am not sure if I am doing it wrong (I'm following the instructions that come with this and have watched instructional videos online on how to use it properly) or maybe the blades on my knives are complete garbage. Either way this sharpener has not been what I expected it to be. There are some positive aspects to this though which are the size, the ability to store it in the handle, and the price. I am gonna look at buying Smith's TRI-6 Arkansas TRI-HONE Sharpening Stones System instead and see if that makes a difference."
4,Good product at a reasonable price,"This sharpener is a pocket version of a boxed unit I keep in my shop. The handle reverses to enclose the dual sharpening surfaces, making it a compact package to carry in your field back, if not in your pocket, as it is a little heavy to cart around in your pocket, in case you are bored and want to sharpen your knife. But as an addition to your kit, it is ideal, and will keep or restore your knife's edge quickly and effective Contrary to description, it is 9 inches open and 6 inches closed."
3,"What Happened To ""Stomp Dance""?","Length:: 2:35 MinsI love Micheal Nyman's compositions. The score is beautiful and very moving. I ordered the soundtrack to specifically hear the Ragtime-like piece, ""Stomp Dance"". It was part of the movie soundtrack, but not included on the cd. Bummer! (special thanks to ""sombrerero"" on youtube for creating this great presentation.)"
1,"Boring, bombastic and blah!","Without a doubt one of the worst musical scores ever written for a film. I really wanted to like the film because of the fine performances by Emma Thompson and Jonathan Price. But I was almost driven from the theater by the wall-to-wall, repetitive, droning, boring dreck Nyman forced on the audience. A little restraint would have been nice. Avoid this one like the plague."
1,No support from Atari,"The game looks like fun, but I had the same CD Key problem that many other people have had. After a week of complete silence from Atari, ignoring my 5 support requests, I had no choice but to ask Amazon for a refund. Disappointing,because I really wanted to play this game."
1,Yet another angry customer with duplicate cd-keys,"Yeah, I bought this at Best Buy, and the cd-keys included are duplicates. So, I can't play the game. Had to send a letter to to atari support. They say I'll get a faster response if I include a scanned copy of the install manual (which kinda implies I may be a thief). But is there a way to attach a picture through their website email? NO! They screwed this up and they could have either: a) recalled the product & fixed it or to save money - b) gave new cd-keys to all the retailers affected to hand out with new purchases. They say it's a great game, but is it worth all this hassle?"
4,A True RPG,"the title says it all, Just like D&D this game brings out the true RPGer in all of us, with detailed story plots, mercenary character development, and even the use of other story modules. Its a game that can be play for hours at a time for days and days. Only downside I found is that the farther you go, the difficulty doesn't increase as fast, so it allowed me to invelope myself in the plot more"
4,game of choice,i bought the game for a friend who wanted it. i had the orgianly one and i love the game but this was a great idea to put them all in one makes it easier for people to play. already have the expanshins and the opotions that most people want when they buy games.
1,Very frustrating trying to install! Buyer Beware.,"I bought this game and the geniuses at Atari printed the same product key for all three games, instead of a different product key for each game, effectively rendering this game useless. I spent 3 hours trying to install it only find under the online FAQ that apparently Atari shipped a lot of these games with either no product keys or the same product key replicated three times. Bioware and their cursed product key!! Anyway, this game is buyer beware! I sent an E-mail to Atari requesting new product keys, if I don't hear from Atari in a few days, I'll be returning the game to Amazon and I'll let Amazon deal with it.I've played this game before and it's a great game, but if I can install it, it's just a shiny drink coaster."
1,CD KEYS ARE WRONG - DON'T BUY THIS RUBBISH!!,"The latest version of this game has had the CD keys printed wrongly in the manual so you can't play the game. After spending two hours on their support sites trying to find this I emailed to receive this response:If you can, please either scan or take a digital picture of one of the following items.1) The front of the game CD2) The box3) The game manual showing the CD keys (if available)4) The sales receiptFunny I thought I had paid money for this game that will not function!!Do not purchase this junk."
3,Not compatible with Vista,"Had I known this game wasn't compatible with window's vista, I wouldn't have bought it."
3,Recent Batch of DVD Serial Numbers,I recently bought 15 copies of this product for our college. We use the NWN toolset for game design. Our school already owned 15 copies of this game so this would bring our number of copies up to 30. The first batch of 15 which we purchased over a year ago were great. The recent batch we purchased used the same serial number for all the games in the package. Only about half of the serial numbers worked for all the games; we used the old serial numbers with the new batch to enable the students to use the all the games included on the DVD disk. If this had been a single purchase we would have been out of luck. You might want to consider buying a used copy rather than the new product.
1,Got Windows 7? Forget it.,"Okay I have had this computer on several different computers. I have enjoyed playing it. It's a very fun game to play. There is one issue I got rid of my older computers, and decided to buy this game again to put on my new computers. Well it will not run on Windows 7. Even with all the compatibility options set to older versions of Windows the game will still not run. I wasted my money on this game. The messed up thing is that the old Baldur's Gate I & II, and Icewind Dale I&II run perfectly fine on the same computers. You can't get any tech support from Atari or Bioware either."
4,As Good as I remember,"I love this game. I recently purchased it and my main problem was downloading it to a spot and getting it to open properly. Im not sure if there is the same problem with installing via disk but i would think there was. I ended up installing it 3 times before i found out i had to open the folder itself and couldnt go through the main menu to start the game as per usual. Additionally if i wanted it to work i couldnt install it in a programs file either. Other than that i still love the game which is why it got 4 stars. Installing was awful but the game istelf is still amazing =) I might be a little biased. Magic was difficult for me to get used to but the combat itself is easy to understand. It is worth the money, I find the storyline to be very intriguing."
4,Great game!,"This game is very good, it has a lot of variety and virtually endless gameplay and replayability, if you like this kind of games, like baldurs gate or diablo 2...the current version of the game 1.69 runs excellent on modern OS, so this game is recommended if you are a fan of good addicting rpgs!"
1,Neverwinter Nights - Diamond Edition,"Product installed fine, but was NEVER able to access game due to erroneous security responses. Attempted to contact support services (ATARI) and have received no response in 2 weeks."
3,Pretty good game,"I've enjoyed NWN. I've only played as one character so far, but there's a lot of replayability there. However, I've been frustrated by the bad multiplayer interface, especially since I bought the game to play multiplayer."
4,great game still,i got nwn around 3 and a half years ago and i still can't find many of the new games that can match it. It has splendid detail and lots of hours of gameplay. Also once your all done with the single player campains you can take your characters online to the massive community there. The only bad point about this game is the fact that it reserves special things for pc users thus not giving mac players (like me) various things in the game such as the toolset etc. I wish that bioware would care a bit more about the mac side of there community.But other than that it's a great game to be sure!And with nwn 2 coming out the series only keeps getting better!
1,Should not be mentioned with the greats.,Game plays fine but the original campaign is so boring and no group gameplay like bg2 or icewind dale. Really seems like they went backwards in this game. NPC characters and voice acting are good. The combat is really bland and boring. Multiplayer is ok but other games like wow or diablo 2 just do it way better. If you want to play a worthwhile rpg start with bg1/2 iwd1/2 they just make this game obsolete.
2,Could not get into this,"After loving Oblivion, Morrowind, Baulders Gate I/II, Icewind Dale I/II I could not get into this game it does not have the same fun, or interest factor to keep me playing. I started out thinking it was kind of cool but there so so much better in depth games out there."
3,be careful buying the diamond version....,"I purchased the diamond version and it wouldn't load at all. Went to bioware's home page and checked the FAQ's. Well, they rushed a number of the diamond versions out before they discovered a loading error which you have to correct. So save your receipt when buying the diamond version because it might not work. I played the original and it was enjoyable but with the problems I had prevented me on giving the game itself a higher rating. Plus those portraits are horrid."
3,good game but slow game play,This is a good game but it has slow game play and you can get tired of playing easly.
1,Send it to the landfill!!!!,"Would not play in windows 7. Dwnloaded several updates hoping that would help, no luck. If you are still running XP give it a shot, if windows 7 don't waste your money."
4,"Few bugs, but it's still amazing","I wanted this game so much because of all the hype when it first came out and I finally got it as a gift a few years back. I've played it so many times, combining so many different classes with different behavioural characteristics. The expansion packs were great and it kept me busy for a good amount of weeks and the multiplayer function was just as enjoyable.There were some bugs every now and then, but the autosave function saved my life sometimes. And sometimes the storyline and the quests did get tedious, but what's the point of a good game that doesn't build up to a good plot?This is a game that keeps on giving and if I hadn't lended it to the person that gave me it as a gift, I would still be playing it now. This started the CRPG phase for me and for that, it will always be great."
5,Complete pakcage..all in one,"I was a fan of the orginal game. This complilation DVD takes all the hassle of seperate installs or switching disks. For those who just decieded to play this game again (me), I found the two ""premium"" modules to be worth while. Overall its a good buy, but not for those who already own the game or the ""kingmaker"" modules. For those new to Neverwinter Nights, this is a good way to sample it all...at once."
2,Diamond Edition - Bad CD Keys,"While the game itself stands the test of time, the distribution of the Diamond edition is riddled with problems. See the Atari tech support for more information.The problem I had is with the CD keys. Each game needs a unique key, but the manual supplies the same key for all the games. When you try to play it, it won't authenticate.You have to go through Atari tech support via e-mail (no phone), and it takes them 7-10 days to respond. Some buyers are reporting that they have to send proof of the manual misprint before keys are released to them."
1,"Can't play the game, 3 same keys, no email support","It's now been 45 days. I've emailed Atari's tech support 3 times. No real answers from them at all, just an automated ""we got your email"" message. I'll be returning the game for a refund. I will never buy another Atari game or product again."
1,NO CD KEY- can't play game.,The game as the other comments idenicate has 3 duplicate CD keys so you can't play the game.Atari doesn't seem to want to help in a reasonable amount of time and they want you to jump through hoops.The product should be RECALLED.
3,Missing Keys,"Ignore the rating. I gave it average because it won't let me give it no rating.I have no idea at this point whether the game is fun or not, as I've fallen victim to the missing keys problem. There is this nice glossy white fold-out page with nothing on it. Wonderful quality control. I guess it's time to contact Amazon, but the Atari forums are not showing things to be very promising as it seems replacement products through Amazon all (most?) have the missing keys problem."
4,"A couple camera issues, but otherwise great.","This is a fantastic game; very enjoyable despite its age. My only two complaints deal with the camera. Sometimes when your character walks too close to a wall, the camera zooms so far in you can't see anything, but you only have to rotate the camera a bit to zoom back out again. Also, not all camera settings are saved, so when reloading a saved game the camera angle and zoom distance are reset to defaults.That aside, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fantasy RPGs, and especially any D&D; fans. It even makes some minor improvements on pen-and-paper D&D;, such as a Lore skill which lets you identify magic items without a spell."
4,Nice but not that nice,"Neverwinter Nights is a fine RPG, the chracter generation is engaging and after a few test runs you should be able to craft a fairly intriguing character. It's propably my favorite aspect of the game so far, I am halfway throught he first adventure so far and have meddled in the others mods. The game play is fine as are the graphics but it is not as intriguing as Morrowind, Baldurs Gate 2 or Planescape. Other than those two games I would put it up at the forefront of the second rank of RPGs such as Icewind Dale. Given the price and what you get this is a great deal."
5,Awesome,game is great. It seems most reviews cover almost everything but here's something you might need to know before you buy it.You must patch game before you can play it in windows 7 or the compatibility assistant will block it. you may have issues playing in game cinematics (game version 1.69)
5,Oldie but Goody!,"I know that this game is considered one of the older RPG game, but I love it. I have had the standard Neverwinter Nights and played it several times. Getting this adds a lot more for me to do and lots more time to play. I love this game and even when I finally upgrade to 2 I will still keep this one installed. Very replayable with a different character. I know that many of the quests stay the same, but with a different class it keeps the replayability well. Arrived fast and in great shape!"
5,A masterpiece! A must-play for any gamer.,"I remember when I bought this game at its launch. I had just finished Baldur's Gate 2, and then I found out that Neverwinter Nights was by the same people! I begged my mom to take me to the store to get it. I played it for days and days. In middle school, it was more or less the only thing I did after school. Then my computer broke. I bought this edition 2 years later, and I wasn't expecting it to be as good as I remembered. On the contrary, it was even better! I was shocked that a game could have as rich of a community as this one. Everyone must play this before they die!"
3,Trying to Hard,"Where Kaplan's ""Coral Reefs"" manages to take a difficult field guide topic and conquer it, ""Southeastern and Caribbean Seashores"" Takes an impossible task and muddles it. I don't know what the people at Peterson's Field Guides was thinking! The topic is far to broad to include in one book, and Kaplan seems to try and make it broader. He includes coral reefs and things distinctly NOT on the shore as well as including topics already in other field guides. I do NOT want to belittle Kaplan (whom I enjoy) or Peterson's (who I think makes the best mass consumption field guides available) but unless you really need it, I would stay away from this book. It does win points for it&#65533;s illustrations and Kaplan&#65533;s knowledge and writing style."
1,not safe to pour,"The Corelle rooster tea kettle is nice looking. That's where the perks end. The first one that arrived had a chip in the enamel. Amazon's exchange process was very good. However, when the second kettle arrived and we actually boiled some water, that's where the trouble started. The spout is too short, or placed too low on the kettle. The boiling water bubbles out when pouring and leaves a puddle everytime. I would not recommend this kettle, I believe it is unsafe and will lead to someone getting scalded. Ours is now being used as a outdoor watering can."
2,Love Amazon Adored Tea Kettle,"I love Amazon, they allowed me to return my teakettle after owning it for 3 months.. I loved the thing so much I gave it 2 stars for appearance and the pleasure of greeting it's loveliness each morning. I kept it 3 months while it splattered, dripped and ran boiling water all over my kitchen. I finally gave up the hope that it was operator error and emailed Amazon begging for a return. WOW! They agreed to allow me to return it. Maybe because I am a regular purchaser.This is a beautiful item, but I am a daily user of my teakettle and it just got toooo annoying having to clean up the mess."
1,tea kettle,do not care for it..drips when you pour the water in to the cup.Also the whistle sounds like a tornado siren or air raid.
2,'looks can be deceiving'.,"I bought this Teakettle because it is very pretty and has a trusted name. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. There is something wrong with the way the water comes out of the spout. It seems to splash out all at once while pouring. it is very easy to burn your hand. My adult daughter had this happen twice before she learned to keep her free hand away while pouring. It could have something to do with the spout being so low on the pot. I don't like giving a product a low rateing, but this one really deserves it!"
2,Nice Looking dribbles water air raid siren,It is a great looking kettle and will probably last a long time but it does not have a good lip on the spout and when pouring even very slowly dribbles substantial water down the kettle and on to surface each time you pour. Siren does sound like and air raid siren. Wish I would have read similar reviews before bought.
3,nice design,"It was disappointing when we went to poor the water it leaked water all around where we were pouring the water. Love the design though and it is sturdy, just wish it wouldn't leak all over when we pour."
1,Miseducates Children,"This book is rife with historical inacurracies and is highly offensive to anyone who knows the truth about the horrors committed in Indian boarding schools. As a descendent of one of the pupils/inmates of the Carlisle School, where this abysmal book is set, I urge you not to expose any children to this gross misrepresentation of the toture many children endured in an effort to ""civilize"" Native American peoples."
1,From a Librarian's Viewpoint,"The author has done a great disservice to all First Nation people as she has taken children's names from a grave yard and basically ""spun yarns"" about their lives. I have talked first hand with people from the Blackfoot Nation and they talked about what happened to their parents in boarding schools. It was not the ""sugar coating"" that Ms. Rinaldi speaks of at all. Many of the problems that First Nation people have may be traced back to forcing children to attend boarding school, such as poor parenting skills, by not having any examples of parents to follow while growing up.The White people treated the First Nation people with disrespect toward their culture, language, religion, and music. You could say history repeated itself with how the Whites treated all others different than themselves.When you read this book, make sure that you take this into account."
2,Made Up,"I'm a four-teen year old who really disliked this book because alot of things are just made up. On page 32, Nannie's mother asks, ""What will you learn? To be more silly than you are?"" Lakota Children where treated with alot more respect then that. Then another thing when Belle Rain Water gave Nannie a prayer stick, A hopi child wouldn't give a Lakota child a prayer stick! Sacred objects like these were/are not things children have or share. Just one of Ann Rinaldi made up things. And alot more botherd me while I read the rest of the book."
3,An Okay Book,"My Heart is on the Ground was an okay book. In the beginnig it was pretty boring, but later on it got better. I had to read it a couple of times to like it."
4,Whata great book!,"I just reciently read this book and I thought it was great. I think the author must be really good because in some parts of the book, I almost wanted to cry (and that usually doesn't happen very easily!). All in all, I think this is a very good, well-writen and thought through book and it is well worth reading! *~Katy~*"
5,This girl had just come from a tribe what do you expect?,"Nannie Little Rose was a girl who was picked to go to the white man's world school.She was a good person and at times I didn't understand her,but otherwise it was a great book.All you people who say this book is a piece of trash,well you all are WRONG, because it was a GREAT BOOK."
4,Nannie Little Roses Story,"The setting of this story took place at a school named Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania in the late 1800's.The conflict of this book was the white men were invading the indian scools and villages, killing them and there food. The resolution was they had to move to reservations that was taken care of by the government.Nannie Litlle Rose was best friends with Pretty Eagle. Little Rose swore she would keep the secret of Pretty Eagle going into trances. The indians believed her to be a medicine woman. When Pretty Eagle died, Little Rose wasn't allowed to go to the funeral.I liked this book because it taught me about how the indians lived back then. I think I would have liked to leve in that time because they rode horses to go anywhere. It also taught me some history about the indians in America.This review is by Raquel Fazzino"
1,Extensive Review of this Book at Oyate,"A previous poster mentioned this long, powerful critical review. I am just posting to give you all the link, which includes a long explanation of what the Indian boarding schools were actually like: <...>"
1,A decent yarn but white-washed,The story is moving at points but seriously misrepresents numerous aspects of native American culture.
1,What was Rinaldi thinking?,"I used to have a great deal of respect for Ann Rinaldi. I must own at least twenty of her books, and have read many more than once. This particular book, however, is an atrocity, and the fact that she continues to stand behind it is disgusting. I don't know what she was thinking when she wrote this awful book. I was pleased to see that one reviewer already mentioned the Oyate website, however they failed to mention that not only is this book on the ""Books to Avoid"" list, as are many classics such as ""The Indian in the Cupboard"" and ""the Sign of the Beaver,"" but there are pages and pages of criticism, in fact one of the longest criticisms on the list. Too many problems to be listed in one small review. If you have any social conscience at all, you will not use this horrible book."
5,"Great, wonderful, amazing, every word of that sort.....","This was the most touching story I have ever read. When Little Rose's friend dies, you want to pray with all of your hart to everyone that knew her. It is a butifull story of hope, love, faith, and friendship. Please, read this book. (It was one of those books that makes you listen about indians in Social Studies Class.)"
5,"Exellent, savory, brillant!","My Heart is on the Ground is a wonderful story of the confusion of going to a Indian boarding school. I think that it must have been quite confusing to go far away from your home, wear clothes that are seemingly way to long, having your long hair cut, (A symbol of sorrow) and having your best friend die. It is a wonderful book!"
1,Massive and harmful disinformation,"I am not the kind of person who espouses censorship of any kind, but this book is not only degrading to Native Americans in its use of tone and language, the facts presented about Carlisle are highly inaccurate. One glaring example: in reality, not only did Spotted Tail's children want to leave with him, but many, many other children did as well. Trying to put white icing on one of the most horrible American tragedies is extremely disrespectful of Rinaldi."
1,Not recommended,"This book is full of stereotypes and misinformation. Pure fiction from a non-Indian point of view. If I could give negative stars, I would."
1,Historically Inaccurate,"Having recently read this book for a class I was appalled and astonished at its historical inaccuracies. Although billed as 'historical fiction' it is just fiction. Other than the name of the school and the names lifted off of headstones, there is no history here. It should not be treated as anything but fiction. See the following website for more details. [...]"
1,I cannot recommend this book to anyone!,"First of all, I thought the book was poorly written. The language is stilted and annoying to read. The plot is filled with inconsistencies. Most importantly, it is not historically accurate. Just from reading the author's historical notes, you can tell she took considerable artistic license. I wondered why the research was even conducted or included in the book when most of it was obviously ignored. (...)I just hope this book is not indicative of the series as a whole."
1,not what I expected,"Being in a ""yoga"" book club, I was very interested in the stories behind the Deities we hear about in yoga. I would have liked to have known that this was more of a 400 page text book, as opposed to an easy to understand story and explanation."
1,Eye dropper set,"From the picture of the item, I expected to receive 3 small bottles in the order, but the order had only 2 bottles. The cap on the eyedropper continually comes off when transported. I have tried squeezing the bottle first to try to create a vaccuum, but the top always comes off."
3,Dissapointed,"When I purchased this calendar last year the calendar was designed so that you could turn each of the illustrations into prints. It was on heavy cardstock type paper and was very nice. I was therefore extremely dissapointed when my calendar arrived and it was just like any calendar with the glossy pages. I am not sure why they changed it or did not have different types of calendars, but I will probably not buy the calendar if it is like this again next year"
2,"texsport 14"" frying pan","handle is heavier than frying pan,it will not sit evenly on stove burner. very light weight, not considered a bargain purchase."
4,"Throw it down, a development of persistence",Throw it down is for drum corps nuts and people who wish to understand what it takes to perform. It is an excellent video. Learning how a DCI Drum Corps puts itself together is entertaining and thought provoking.Well worth an evening
2,Not enough percussion footage,"It was 'ok'. Not enough percussion drill footage. As a drum line teacher, I was hoping to show it to my drummers, but there just isn't enough footage of just drums. Lots of horn stuff. The party bus scene made it unable to be shown to high school kids. Teachers have to be too careful these days."
5,Excellent!!,"Recieved the entire album.. no missing or half songs on this one. I have recently ordered a few MP3 albums here, especially the Black Sabbath albums during the DIO years. every song is here and is in full length thanks."
3,Fly like the best but fragile,"It flies like the best, easy to control, easy to land, easy to take off, its really fun. BUT first crash the airplane broke up, in 2 peaces, its so fragile. I dont recomend to buy it, because it will broke up, so pay a bit more and buy one more expencive, it will last longer... I recomend Megatech Airtrike, i have crashed this airplane like hell and still getting airbone =)"
1,"Junk, Don't buy",Don't buy this junk plane. I had a similar one that it crashed form the first time and couldn't get a fuselage for. I had to thru after spending countless hours trying to fix it.
5,im 10 years old,i dont know how cool is this toy but my dad is gonna buy my one sunday im shure its a cool plane and works i had heard that for those people who broke theirs because you threw it wrong.Throw it straight and dont throw it hard throw it smooth and light not hard
4,Another overlooked artist,"This young singer-songwriter has a very interesting voice. Her version of the Kinks' ""I'm Not Like Everybody Else"" is one of the best covers ever. And, she's from Texas."
5,Dohnanyi's soul of Brahms,"Johannes BrahmsChristoph Von DohnanyiSymphonie No. 2, op 73Haydn Variationen, op 56aCleveland Orchestra(Teldec - DDD - 1988)Just as he did in his earlier CD of symphony no. 1, Dohnanyi captures the soul and spirit of Brahms in this performance of symphony no. 2.This CD is brilliant. Five Stars"
3,Only three disks,"This is great comedy, however, it is NOT 4 disks, only 3. I told Amazon about it, but they have done nada, zip, zilch, NOTHING. As long as you can be happy with not getting what they say this is, you will like this disk set."
3,Review of Nanotechnology : An overview DVD,"The DVD is a recording of a lecture (with overhead slides).There is no animation of any kind and I must say I was a little dissapointed. The speaker used a laser pointer which you could not see on the DVD so it was hard to make out what he was pointing at, unless you already knew!Ok for science students as a lecture, not really suitable for general viewing. I would recommend they redub the lecture (which was either powerpoint or just slides) with a marker so the viewer can see what the speaker is pointing at.I think it is rather expensive for what it is.Prof H. Fearn. (Physics Professor CSUF)"
3,Big Friendly Butterfly,"The colors are appealing and the metallic wave effect is cool!!!Although the butterfly's head looks more like a snail's and the wings look a little heavy, he is very friendly and happy looking.I know that this butterfly will be loved by the seven year old girl who will make a home for him."
4,A Romantic Movie,"It's definetelly a romantic movie in a romantic city, Paris, which one makes us to think about what really is important in life ! A well balance ordinary life or an exciting love life !"
3,"Nice, relaxing, a simple love story.","A very sweet and simple love story, everybody knows the end...but it is very enjoyable."
4,"Just a simple, good love story",I saw Karen Allen in the Glass Menagerie with Joan Woodward and was very impressed with her acting. I just happened to watch this movie that TiVo downloaded by itself.What a delight. So real in feelings. Great acting and scenery and that French guy...WOW ....even at my age he gave me a thrill.I love this movie and want to watch it again so I set Tivo to download and am buying the Video while I wait for the DVD.
4,Always a sucker for a romance!,"I agree with the reviewer who said this movie can be picked apart for little things, but on a whole, what a great romantic escape! Well, it's got a plot that's like a Harlequin romance, but haven't we women read one of those at least once in our lives?I always watch this one when I'm blue & I just love it...the hero is so sexy (the heroine says: ""you have the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen"" -- truer words were never spoken), Paris is so beautiful, the ending is happy, what more can you ask for? Oh, yeah, and it's pretty well acted too!"
3,Until September,I first saw this moving in 1984. It had always stuck in my head. I just recently saw it again in 2005 and now I know why. It is a movie that explores many feeling and sensations. It is a movie that says sometimes leopards can get in control of their spots.......
5,UNTIL SEPTEMBER,"I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE SO MANY TIMES THAT EVEN THOUGH MY DAUGHTER WAS EXTREMELY YOUNG ,SHE REMEMBERED ME WATCHING IT AND NOW LOVES IT AS MUCH AS I DO. IT IS AN EXCELLENT ROMANCE AND THE CHEMISTRY AND HUMOR MADE UP FOR THE MORAL ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED.A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE AND MISTRESSES ON THE SIDE SUCCUMBS TO TRUE LOVE. THIERRY LHERMITE IS AND STILL IS GORGEOUS AND I SIMPLY LOVE KAREN ALLEN FROM PRIOR MOVIES. CALL ME SMARMY BUT TRITE OR NOT I USE TO RENT IT EVERY WEEK UNTIL I COPIED IT AND EVENTUALLY LOST EVEN THAT. I SAW IT AGAIN RECENTLY AND THE LOVE AFFAIR LIVES ON."
2,"Hard, overlaced P.O.S.","Not worth the money, however it is very durable. Also very uncomfortable. I should also mention I have large arms, which may the reason for the discomfort. It would most likely fit a women or child though."
5,The Garments and their Meanings,"Charles W. Slemming is detail and excellent in his writtings on the Old Testament Tabernacle, Feasts and now the Garments. There is no other book that has as much details jammed packed into a small paperback as this. He not only covers the 12 stones found in the breastplate but does so by covering categories for each stone!!!! He also covers the Aaronic priesthood as well as the Melchisedec Priesthood. Do not be fooled by the smallness of the book, for its very depth will surprise you."
5,good review,In my poor opinion I think this is one of the best mouses I have owned or used. I don't really consider myself as a good opinion writer because I don't know how other people would review it.Thank you
4,As Described and Delivered Fast,Product arrive as described - easy set up to computer - delivery was fast as it was for another mouse that was failing
1,crappy mouse,Doesn't work on my mac laptop (cursor keeps bouncing around and getting stuck). NOT usable! Did not have the same prob w/ Microsoft Wheel Mouse. Get a better mouse than this!
5,A Good How - it's - Done Expose',"Huston's book is short, funny, illustrated and clearly explains the tricks to fool the gullible behind claims of telepathy, telekinesis, levitation and other New Age nonsense. Particularly good is his account of how simply UFO phots. can be faked."
3,Misleading Title,"Its got a misleading title this is in no shape or form a ""step by step how to manual"". This is more like exposing frauds and how to spot some occult nonsene. I love the artwork and love certain chapters. There's only like one or two chapters that are a waste of space. Its an interesting read and this guy is very funny. But all in all he really does Expose Scams From ""The Great Beyond""."
1,all the fun's in paddle ball,"If you check out the cities of the other reviewers, you will notice they are all from around or near LA. That is because they were all, very likely, students of Steele at CAl State LA.I wonder if their individual reviews of this book helped them get a better grade in his poetry course?While Steele is a good poet (see his poetry books), he has made a name for himself in academia by self-righteously asserting that poetry must be written a certain way to be truly poetic. He does not merely frown on free verse; he rejects it.Steele likens free verse to playing tennis without a net. HIs point seems to be that once the rules of a game are broken, something has been lost in the joy of playing or watching it. However, tennis without a net is called paddle ball, and unless you're a New English prig straight out of the pages of Yankee magazine, it's a heck of a lot of fun."
4,Fun!,"We enjoyed this movie when it was released about 15 years ago so we thought we would like to see it again; we were not disappointed! This is one of those 'timeless' movies that can always be enjoyed. Ordinarily I do not care for the gratuitous nudity in so many movies today. However, the brief nudity in this movie is funny rather than offensive."
3,Early Evanovich is a charmer,"Janet Evanovich is better known for her immensely popular, offbeat series of Stephanie Plum novels (beginning with ""One For the Money""). Ms Evanovich broke into the business by writing romance novels, and ""Ivan Takes a Wife"" is not only a charming example of this genre, but an indication of where the character of Stephanie might have originated. For the Stephanie of this novel is not a fragile, gentle flower but a retired cop with a habit of falling (off hillsides, roofs, and boats) and an sassy attitude. Janet includes trademarks her fans will recognize and appreciate, from the steamy sexual situations to the offbeat, delightful supporting characters, and even throws in a bit of a mystery to keep the story moving along. If you have the good fortune to find this novel, enjoy it!"
4,Ivan Takes A Wife,"If you are a Janet Evanovich fan, you will enjoy this twice published short story from her first earlier writings. I enjoyed finding all nine originals before they were republished! I have all of her books. She's very entertaining!"
3,Run Aroung,"Cooker itself seems okay on first try, but thermometer does not seem to work properly and I need a replacement. I called the Customer Service Representative number on the enclosed sheet and was instructed to call another number. Called that number and the person on the recorder must of been an auctioneer at one time because he talked so fast I had to do it several times to get the correct number. Once on the correct number all I could do is keep going around and around in a loop on the phone with the same person finally asking me to call the same number we were then taking on. Bottom line is I was finally able to leave a number for them to call me back. This needs WORK..."
5,Fry it All,All you need in a set. Very efficient and easy to assemble. We use it for all kinds of fried foods and heats the oil in a matter of minutes and with an adjustable knob you can regulate the heat very well! Durable all around Great buy!
4,Necklace Review,"I bought this necklace because it was just enough to show off my pride. It wasn't screaming to the public my sexual preference, and I liked that. My only issue with the pendant is that the cord came untied within the first day, and I have to keep tightening the knots to prevent the necklace from slipping off my neck. Other than that small inconvenience, the product is great. I actually bought a second one to give to my boyfriend."
4,"Cute ""little"" necklace","This necklace is a very nice item for someone who is wanting to discreatly wear their pride without flashing the cliche rainbow. I like it because it's very different and has a simple design. The only flaw I have seen is that it is smaller in size than it appears in the photo -- its only about an inch or inch and a half long -- other than that, it's really nice."
5,Love it,I ordered this to show a little bit of pride without being a walking rainbow. I LOVE it and I get many complements on it.
4,Wonderful!,"This is a wonderful piece of jewelry! It looks really great and it has some nice things like the adjustable string. I really love this product - its very stylish and even a little discrete. I only gave this 4 stars because of one major issue: wear. I've only had this for about a month and there are way too many scratches on it - and they change the texture of it and makes it look bad. I've only had it on for really general usage - nothing that should have scratched it so it isn't the most durable. As for other's saying the string comes loose, that has not been a problem for me. Also, just to note, the picture looks like the pendant is beveled out (looks like its bulging out) when in reality, its beveled slightly in. Also, the metal is a brushed metal, not a solid color metal. But don't worry, I think it looks better than its picture!"
2,Too Basic to be of any Value,I think you would be much better spending your money elsewhere. I find the video to basic for just about anyone. My opinion.
4,"GOOD BUT,....",I love the music but this is a transfer from original release and it's a little hard to listen.
1,what are we buying?,I love the Hanson Cobalt drills. The split dual angle on the tip makes needing a pilot hole almost a thing of the past. The tip also almost makes wandering impossible. Just don't use the fastest speed your drill will do. Over 99% of the time I have to use a hand drill on site and many times the performance of these drills draws a small crowd. They are worth the money. You will make it up in gas alone not going to the hardware store to replace drill bits. I have had the 29 piece set for well over 10 years and have had no problems untill it came time to replace a few of the bits. It seems that the size wasn't important enough to include in the product discription. As soon as they fix it I will be updating my set.
1,Stay away from this product.,"This heart rate monitor is very good for the many useful monitoring features that come with it. The major problem with it though is that the thinned down portion of the rubber strap that joins to the main body of the transmitter is so poorly designed (or maybe made of extremely inferior rubber). Mine snapped before less than a month of use. I hope TIMEX corrects this design flaw. For a comparably equipped monitor, go for the Polar A5 instead (although it costs about forty bucks more), which comes more or less with the same functionality but is already tested for its durability."
2,"good watch, bad chest strap","I just want to echo the prior reviewers comments about the chest strap not holding up, mine broke after 6 months. If that problem can be fixed, then great product."
3,Not an ideal heart rate monitor,"On the plus side, this watch is not large and cumbersome compared to other HRMs and has very readable digits.OTH, the watch only remembers information for one heart rate zone (out of 5, four auto and one programmable) thus you don't know how long you were exercising in the other zones. I own a Sports Instruments ECG3 which keeps track of time spent in all three zones, but has no programmable zone. The Timex records max heart rate, the SI does not. The chest band of the Timex is not as robust as SI at the joins between the plastic part of the band and the elastic part. I prefer the SI unit despite its much bulkier wrist monitor."
4,brought my dvd player back to life,"I was on the verge of throwing out my dvd player due to it's constant message of ""the disc is dirty"" when the dvd was brand new. This reusable laser lens cleaner has made my dvd player work again, and even fixed my fiance's Playstation2 when it began to act up.Worth the $10."
5,Maintenance Kit?,"Maybe 3M redesigned and renamed this product after I bought it? Mine says Scotch Laser Lens Cleaner for DVD Players & DVD-ROM Drives, but the other odd thing is this listing on Amazon has ""Technical Details"" and lists...System Ram Type: SDRAMItem Package Quantity: 2I don't see what SDRAM has to do with anything, nor package quantity. This item is simply a DVD disk with 10 holes drilled in it and 5 bundles of microfibers taped into them. When played in your DVD player the brushes knock any dust or debris off the lens, effectively cleaning it. It also runs some sound and video tests if you're interested in that. I only use mine for dusting off the lens now and then."
5,The best of southern cooking,"After eating at Belle Meade and getting hooked on the cheese grits and fried chicken, I had to buy the cookbook. This one does not disappoint. Everything I have made from this is wonderful. Fried green tomatoes, bread pudding...all of it fabulous. It is also easy enough for every day cooking. With the exception of occasional ingredients that are local specialties (poke salet, spiced round) there aren't quirky ingredients or overly complicated recipes. It might be the one cookbook on my shelf I couldn't live without."
4,The New Southern Basics: Traditional Southern Food for Today,Great book for learning the basics of southern cooking. Recipes were easy to follow and delicious. Would definitely recommend.
3,Kind of misleading,"Although this toy is fun, don't buy it just because of the colors on the box., You do not get these colors. You get 1 small bag of beads in very dull colors. I was excited to make the projects on the box but they don't give you all of thoses colors. Also there are no patterns for the projects you have to guess what pegboard to use and just eyeball the project on the box while your trying to make it."
1,Waste of money,The box is very misleading and not worth the money. You only get a small bag of dull beads and 4 plain peg boards and no designs. Should be $5 at most.
5,Amazing product,"This product is amazing, so many songs, so little time.... I guess ill just have to clear my schedual for this baby. Im tellin you this is truly an outstanding product, and I recomend it to EVERYONE!!"
4,Great Jacket,"I bought this for my husband since he does tournament ""bass"" fishing but failed to realize that this jacket was not used for that kind of fishing, opps!! But either way my husband was very satisfied with it and loved me for it."
1,Back Roads Of Europe/East Anglia England,This video is NOT useful in planning a visit to this area.. very little information and fewer helpful photos.. we are VERY disappointed... would NOT recommend.
1,Black marks,Black marks from cutlery and dishwasher. Very ugly but can't afford to replace. It is embarrassing to use them with company and my familly can never really enjoy them. Will never buy this product again.
3,Dishes are NOT Microwavable!,"Beware - Although the company states their Stonewear is microwavable, it is not!I purchased a beautiful white 16 piece place setting. After only a month, one of dinner plates got a crack that ran the entire length of the plate, without explanation. You could see that the crack was actually under the surface.I called the company and they replaced it, only because of the ""short time frame"". I was asked by the representative, if I had washed the plate within the past 24 hours. I had and that was her explanation for the crack. She said that the stonewear should not be placed in the microwave, if it was washed within the past 24 hours. My reaction was that that Pfaltzgraff shouldn't be labeling their product as microwavable when clearly its not. She wouldn't budge an inch! This is totally ridiculous! I have plates that I bought at a dollar store that are still crack proof after 10 years of washing and microwaving. Really deceptive marketing in my estimation!"
4,LovED it,"This game was very fun. First, you chose a model(girl or guy w/ atleast 15 who were very different). Then you chose eyes(liner, shadow, contacts color), lips (liner and color), concealor, hair(hundreds of styles), earings, jewlery, hats, tattoes, and background. Also, you could customize the thickness, depth, and color. You could blend too, and this makeover looks VERY realistic, like a photograph. The only thing is that now that I have a new computer, the game isn't working. I'm not sure why, I think it's just because it's old softwear. But if it does work, you're in for loads of fun!"
2,Not suitable for XP users,"I recently recieved this in the mail from Amazon.com. Not only was the package torn up (I know it was sent from another company and not Amazon, so I don't blame them entirely) but the software wouldn't work on my computer! I tried to install it over and over but apparently the software isn't suitable for some components of Windows XP. I am really disappointed, especially since I was so excited to try this."
2,this is not the greatest program in the world,"It is fine if you are just playing but if you really want to see what you look like and really fool them that this isn't the real you, this is not the program you are looking for. If you just want to have some fun then go ahead. It is sort of."
5,masterpieces deserve more stars in amazon,"I wanted to add a new 5-stars note to these truly outstandig modern works.Too many other composers get 5-stars ratings without beeing as essential as Mr Aaron Jay Kernis is.Sophisticated, colourful and emotionnaly varied, these 2 works show this young composer at his best whatever he writes for orchestra or for traditional chamber ensemble.Just enjoy !"
1,not happy with purchase,"the rock speakers look great, but sometimes do not work, can not figure out why only work sometimes, very disappointed"
3,"Handsome, but they scratch my dishes!","Attractive handcrafted utensils and serving pieces but they have made scratches on both my porcelain AND stoneware dishes! Although I love them, I'm not sure I will keep them. FYI - You can buy these at Bed, Bath & Beyond and at Ace Hardware stores that have a kitchen section."
5,The Universe is made of Motion not Matter,One of Dewey's very best books! In this book he explains histheory of motion and the answers that follow. This is the longawaited Unified Field Theory! This book is more technical andcomprehensive than others. Helps to understand particle physicsand present day conundrums confounding physics. Elaborates howthe universe is basically simple and not based on exceedinglycomplex mathimatical equations. Utterly profound! Brilliantbeyond measure! Could advance science hundreds of years ifaccepted.
5,She's Real!!!,"I first heard of Jessica riddle in a little blurb in a magazine and so I downloaded a song of hers off of the internet and I loved it! I went out and bought the cd in the next week and it has been permanently in my cd player for the last 8 months! All of her songs are bursting with emotion and tell amazing stories! There isn't a bad song on the whole CD!She isn't some dancing pop star who pays people to write her songs,almost every song on the cd is written by her! She is so real and that is why I totally recommend her CD. It is great to play at any time or place and is way worth your money.Jessica riddle is extremely talented singer, songwriter, and pianist(YEP, she plays the piano too!)It's hard to choose, but I'd have to say my fave songs on the album are:Even Angels Fall, Your Girl, For Wowser and Everything."
4,i know her,"I went to high school with jessica riddle, and she is good friends with my ex-girlfriend. i actually saw her this weekend. that ""for wowzer"" song is about my ex-girlfriend. i couldn't believe she had such a good voice. i didn't expect that from her, considering she was a wrestler in high school. but she has always been cool with me, and i think what she is doing is great. keep up the good work."
2,not all there,"you can tell jessica riddle has talent, but i'm not sure if she knows how to piece it all together yet. some have compared her to tori amos, which is why i bought it, but don't use that as a reason to buy it. i couldn't see any traits of tori amos in this cd."
4,Decent Debut,"I first heard Jessica Riddle's song ""Even Angels Fall"" in the movie ""10 Things I Hate About You."" I do believe that's the most well known of the songs on this album, and for good reason as it is one of the best. The songs on this album are truly from the heart of Jessica. Her lyrics seem to all revolve around her life's experiences. One of the best things about this album is the lack of electronic music. She can not only sing very well, but plays instruments too. A great change from the manufactured pop groups dominating the charts these days. If you like true lyrics and a voice that isn't overpowering when singing, and also want something that is a change from the norm, get this CD."
5,So real,"I had heard Jessica's Even Angels Fall on Ten Things I Hate About You, but it wasn't til after i saw her open for BBMAK that i bought her cd after hearing how heartfelt her songs were as she strummed along on her guitar, responding to every ""we love you, jess"" from the crowd with a ""thanks, i love you too"". i was more touched by her realness than her music in truth, but soon after i got the cd i fell in love with every single song and have downloaded new songs shes been writing for her new cd. she's an amazing musician who adds an honesty to music thats hard to come by anymore. all of the tracks on this cd stir up emotions that we've all dealt with, the listener is totally involved with the music. it's an amazing cd, buy it now!"
3,Not bad but there's better,"Several previous reviewers have been enthusiastic about Lynne Dawson's soprano. I have 33 complete Messiah recordings, including 3 with Dawson. I can say without reservation that if you like Dawson here, you will love her on the Harry Christophers recording. With Cleobury she's good; with Christophers she's transcendent.PS -- If you like Dawson don't get the Minkowski recording. She must have been having a very bad day there."
5,beyond Words,This whole Production merits the highest praise. I have listened to incalcuable number of presentations and none approack. The richness and fullness fill each audio scape with the intended sumation Handels talent strived to achieve. I am very proud toown this product. I wish everyone a chance to hear it. Charles McConathy
4,comforting beautiful recording,"I love to listen to this Messiah because the sound quality, recorded inside the original cathedral, is gorgeous, and the soloists are excellent (except for the soprano, who sounds a little warbly at times...) I don't think that heavy stentorian opera singers work well for this music which is so pure and emotionally refined. The transcendant sound of the string players and singers are beautiful. I only have one other reservation....why did they have those all male choirs? The altos are like overgrown young boys whoose voices have changed, but they still have to sing high. It sounds annoying and unnatural, when women are natually suited to alto parts. Anyway, this is still a beautiful cd."
1,Filter is useless without a gasket!,"I've been changing oil in my cars for over 40 years. This is the first time a filter did NOT come with a gasket. I have NO USE for a filter that has no gasket. I refuse to re-use the old gasket that is in my car now.The gasket always comes attached securely to the filter. I have no way to know if the missing gasket is the fault of Amazon (somehow) or the fault of Fram during manufacture. From my point of view, it makes no difference.Of the last three oil filters I bought through Amazon, this is the second one I could not use. The other one had a very large dent in it due to some obvious rough handling somewhere."
4,Fram TG30,"I have been useing this oil filter on my 1969 Camaro 302 for some time now with the Vavoline 10W30 with zinc. No issues to date, what I like is the rough surface on the lower half for easy use. I also use Nappa Gold oil filter too, a little bit more expensive and a little harder to remove."
4,A change of pace :-l,"This is a bit of a departure for Patricia. It's not another book based on her usuall character Kay Scarpetta; it's a brand new forensic thriller with all new characters.It involves a male detective this time, Winston Garano. He is somebody who didn't get into Harvard or any of the other big schools even though he is bright, and he becomes a homicide investigator. He works in Massachusetts and is sent down to Tennessee to go to a course at the National Forensic Academy. While he is there, he is given a cold case to investigate (much to his dislike). The book goes into the case and his search to solve it. While I'm just on half way through it, I'm enjoying it so far, but I've read a couple of other of Patricia's books, and this hasn't been as good as some of them. I think you have to keep an open mind especially if you are a big fan of her writing and her character Kay Scarpetta. As I said earlier, this is a bit of a departure for her, but I think you should give it a go."
3,A passable read,"This is a passable book. I have enjoyed the Kay Scarpetta novels, and enjoyed the strong personalities Cornwall portrays in that series. There is promise with Win, I will have to see if he develops and remains a key figure in a future novel or if this is his last appearance."
3,"Even though it wasn't Scarpetta, this was not bad","Even though I lambasted ""Predator,"" and haven't given PC's recent books high praise, I nevertheless prefer Scarpetta & co. over anything else PC writes. I was very disappointed to find that ""At Risk"" wasn't Scarpetta (next time I'll read advance info more carefully). But my disappointment aside, I read the book and have to say it wasn't bad. PC's other forays into non-Scarpetta were less than thrilling, but ""At Risk"" was okay. I hope PC will write Scarpetta again."
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"This book was so far left of what this author has done in the past that I am in doubt that I will ever read her again! It has gotten so that even her Scarpetta novels are second rate. Lucy is a lost cause, Benton and Kay will never have a good relationship ever again and I seriously doubt that Marino will stay around for long. Cornwell must be going through the ""change"" to put out such horrible pieces of literature ( I am using this term very loosely). Thank God I got this book out of the library and didn't have to pay out a red cent for it, because it certainly would have been a waste of good money!"
2,Disappointing!!,This story was not worthy of a hardback release. I finished this book with a feeling that something was missing. I gave this book two stars because I do feel that the character of Winston is solid and worthy of more attention. A disappointing Cornwell work. It just goes to show that even the most talented authors sometimes throw duds.
1,Disappointing,"Very disappointed in this book. I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's earlier novels and truly enjoyed her work but she's definitely lost it lately. In my opinion her last few books have not been up to the standards I'd grown to expect from her earlier work. This one unfortunately reads like a ""formula paperback"". Undeveloped characters, predictable events, weak plot & weak ending. If she's run out of good ideas or energy, maybe she should just take a break rather than keep publishing these low quality reads."
1,sorry I read this one,"How far Patricia Cornwell has fallen.Read Postmortem, then read (if you can) At Risk. You will feel offended this was written, and you gave it the opportunity of being read.Win, the handsome investigator, and his psychic grandmother are the only redeeming characters in this flop, and then you tend to compare their relationship with Alex Cross and Nanamama, and they lose in that comparison.You keep reading that there will be something in there, but nobody's home - more than that, nobody cares!One more Scarpetta book and if it's haphazard like At Risk, no more hardbacks."
1,What is this?,"I have the previous favorable reviews and they are longer than the book.I, like others, have a full collection of Patrica Cornwell books and couldn't wait until this title came out. Now I am dissappointed.The book is a novelette. Ms Cornwell needs more time with her style of writing to develop her new characters. The only characters I cared about were Nana and Miss Dog and they were side characters. Every one else just annoyed me. I didn't get enough information to have any feelings about them. Its pretty bad when a character gets raped and you don't care. The characters are more complex and the time should have been spent rounding them out.This is the last Cornwell book I will read until she can get her act together. What happened? Did her publisher press her to get one out?"
1,What has happened to you Ms. Cornwell?,"This one started off interesting enough with a detective being pulled and pushed by a female DA who has aspirations for a higher political positions. A 20 year old murder comes into the mix with missing files and a new DNA database: Any Crime, Any Time!Too many characters, undeveloped I might add, are intorduced and I found myself thinking, ""what is this book about and why am I reading it?"" I finished it only out of respect for the great writer Patricia Cornwell used to be. It was confusing and boring and I am still a bit unsure why PC's people allowed this one to be published!Even if you love Ms. Cornwell, take a pass on this one!"
1,Where is the real Patricia Cornwell?,"I stopped buying Cornwell's books several back. It seems that a new writer has taken over her name. Where are the great thrillers she wrote in the beginning? First, she ruined the Scarpetta series with all that personal balderdash with boring crime stories on the side. Now, she seems to have thrown this ""short story"" out in order to reap enough income to pay a bill. Her style is different; her characters have no depth. What are her editors thinking? Does the publishing world need her this badly? Thank goodness, I checked this out at the library. Do not waste two hours reading this."
1,Abysmal,"I can't believe I'm taking the time to write a review, but this book was so disappointing that I don't want anyone else to waste their money or time on it.It was superficial, disjointed, and not in the least bit entertaining or suspenseful. Characters are so superficial, that they are barely there. This seems like a D- assignment attempt from a freshman in college who has no talent. This book was so poorly execute that Cornwell, in the end, has to rely on an unlikely conversation between two of the characters to even explain what actually happened in the story. Apparently, there was a whole storyline that the reader could not pick up on because it was not alluded to until the last 4 pages of the book.Abysmal!"
1,Did not enjoy this book at all,The story was terrible. She used to write great book but this one and a few others show a big change. Her books have gone downhill.
1,Boring/awful,I have never read a book by this author and after this book I won't read another of her books. What a waste of my time. Too many other good writers out there...Lee Childs etc.
1,terrible--don't waste $$,By far the worst book or short story she has written. A real dissapointment
1,Not worth buying,This was a sad disappointment - don't waste your money buying it. I have always been a big fan but will think at least twice if at all about buying another book by Patricia Cromwell!
1,At Risk,I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books and this is the worse yet. It was not written well and the story line was not interesting. I was very disappointed.
1,Disappointed!,"I am glad to know it wasn't just me. I was really disappointed by this book. I have tried to read everyone of Cornwell's books and picked this one up based on past experience. It does not even come close to her usual skills. It may be that it was written for serialization in a magazine. It should not have been allowed out as a book. Her publishers did not do her a favor by letting this go out to the public. It is possible that Win and Sykes could become interesting characters in a well developed book; they were interesting in this book and I liked the setting in Cambridge, but it wasn't enough."
1,At Risk,I didn't think this book was up to Patricia Cornwell's standard. Iwas very disappointed in it.
1,I wasn't sure Patricia Cornwell even wrote this!,"Wow! I was amazed at how bad this book turned out to be. I kept reading thinking that the twist would come and I'd find out what the ""surprise"" was. The surprise was that there was no suspense, no tying together of odd facts that popped up. When I got close to the end I actually read the covers and blurbs again to make sure that Patricia Cornwell really wrote this book. When I finished I really wondered why I bothered to keep reading."
1,Do you think Cornwell actually wrote this awful book?,"I don't remember over the past few years being more let-down by a book. Like many of you, I purhcased this book as soon as it hit the shelves because Patricia Cornwell had written it. Actually, after I read it, I can not really fathom that she wrote this drivel. The characters are shallow, the plot is trivial, and I really am amazed that it made the New York Times Best Seller's list! Their reviewer must be sick."
1,It's a real disappointment,"I love her books, however this one fell very, very short. I should have been tipped off by the thinness of it as well as the double spaced text. (A little bit made to look like alot?!) I kept reading, hoping something big would happen soon, but it never did. The ending came, but no climax nor rhyme or reason for the culprits who did it. Never did find out if Huber and Toby were involved for sure. It was such a waste of my time, that I finished reading it before going to bed and couldn't remember how it ended the next day!! She has done much, much better work."
2,Is this really Cornwell????,"I have been a big fan of her Scarpetta books and have enjoyed her other writings as well......but this book was almost unreadable. I guess everyone is entitled to a bad day (I'll bet she wrote this in one sitting). Glad that this wasn't the first Cornwell book I read, because I would have never read another after this."
2,"Whew! Borrowed, Not Bought, This Time!","Once (okay, the last two or three times) bitten, twice shy, as they say. I only read this Cornwell offering because it was handed to me by a friend. Frankly, it was a bit better than some of Cornwell's recent dreck -- unless, of course, you expect a story to have a beginning and an ending. Add 50 pages introducing the characters and why the chief one is in Tennessee, then tack 50 more on the end to let us know how things all turn out for those characters, and you have a standard-length $25 novel, instead of 224 pages of serialized magazine rebound. And what's with the present tense story-telling (Oh, yeah, the magazine -- trying to make it immediate for the reader in the featurish style. Been there, done that!)? Please stop it! Bottom line: if I'd have paid for this book, it would have gotten a 1-rating. As it is, not as total a waste of time as it would be of money."
2,Disappointing,"Wow...it seemed like Cornwell just needed to meet a deadline for a book. Not only was it a teeny tiny little book, it didn't seem like everything was fully explained by the end. She has a couple of good new characters but I hope she does more with them in her next."
2,Disappointed,"Patricia Cornwell is definitely in a slump. At Risk bears no resemblance to her earlier novels which were packed with non-stop action, intriguing plots and fabulous characters which drew us in on page one and kept us up most of the night. If only this exceptionally talented writer would return to these thrillers ""Body Farm and Postmortem"" being two good examples. Unfortunately in an assumed attempt at literary improvement, she's bound to lose loyal fans. Recently, I read Shadow of Death by Patricia Gussin, a newcomer to medical suspense and a physician with a medical student protagonist. I loved it and am switching my allegiance to Patricia Gussin until Patricia Cornwell gets her act together."
2,"and a half stars. A good start but where's the ""rest of the story""?","I really love Patricia Cornwell and have read Kay Scarpetta series and her other novels but this one left me hanging as in a Paul Harvey story on the radio!We start out with some possibly interesting characters in Detective Win ""Geronimo"" and DA Monique along with ""Nana"" and Sykes of the TBI. We have a twenty-year old murder case and a current rape and assault and some possibly interesting forensics! Our hero is handsome and smart.But we jump all around and while the stories have solutions, the process and procedures are just way to hard to figure out as so much detail that Cornwell usually includes is left out or very skimpy at best.When I read this was a 15 part magazine serial and now a book, I also felt gypped!! I only gave it 2 1/2 stars because it was a good start but Ms. Cornwell -- please expand and make it a REAL complete book!! Please don't let us loyal readers down!!"
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book - the normal twists and turns that you come to expect from Cornwell didn't seem to be there. The excitement of 'how does this connect' wasn't there either. I felt it was not worth the money and I'm sorry I ran to own it when it first came out. I understand artists want to stretch, but the formula that so many came to grow and love is not the plan for many of Cornwell's books anymore. I think this was an average work, and when I know that fabulous work is capable, feel that this was very ho-hum. Get it from your public library instead of supporting mediocre work."
2,At Risk,I am in total agreement with the review that BeachBum posted.I have read all the novels Ms. Cornwell has written and always rush out out to buy her newest. I must say that if this had been her first book I would never had read another.
1,Really Bad,"Believe the one-star reviews. This book is poorly written, poorly organized and poorly plotted.. The only plus is that it's very short. A big drop from Cornwell's other books. Too bad, as there was a germ of a good idea somewhere in there."
1,Bad News,"I am a great fan of Patricia Cornwell, and have read all her books. ""At Risk"" was a huge disappointment. It was so disjointed that from one page to another I had to stop figure out what was going on.Lets hope the next one is better."
1,BORING & Silly,"Very disappointing. So boring and hard to follow. Barely makes sense. Nothing like the Scarpetta books. Ms. Cornwall, please stick to Kay!"
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I picked up At Risk with excitement - it seemed a bit thin. I opened the first page - it was double spaced! Where was the meaty thriller I'd grown used to Patricia Cornwell delivering? I began to read, still hopeful, yet hopes were dashed by disconnected story lines, poorly developed characters, random themes picked up and discarded like gum wrappers on the side of the road. It read like a poorly written outline of a book.I have read Cornwall for years, enjoy Kay Scarpetta and crew, yet - even they have become parodies of themselves during the past few books. Apparently Patricia Cornwell has fallen prey to the same disease which many of our prolific writers have fallen prey to - the misbelief that they are so good they don't need an excellent editor. My hats off to marketing for managing to get this one on the shelves, and thumbs down to everyone related to taking our money on this one. I won't be buying Cornwell again."
1,A Little Disappointed...,"I was a little disappointed with this latest offering by Patricia Cornwell. It was too short and skimpy. It had the potential to be a good story with an interesting plot & characters...it was more like Cornwell ""lo-cal."" I breezed thru this in an afternoon, unsatisfied, still hungry for a good book fix...back in the car to the bookstore to look for something else. My advice, borrow it from a friend for the afternoon, or buy it used. It is not a ""must have"" for Patricia Cornwell fans."
1,At Risk,"I thought that this book was the worst of all her books. I expected the same riveting reading as in her Scarpetta books. Boy! Was I disappointed!! This book is very short and, in my estimation, not a very fleshed out book. It simply was not an exciting read!!"
2,Disjointed (literally),"A convoluted, confusing plot line with characters too broadly drawn. A poor representation of Cornwell's literary skills - even with pieces of a train crash victim. Hopefully, these dysfunctional folks won't return."
1,At Risk,"Is this really Patricia Cornwell? Can't be, this is nothing like her other books, it was terrible. Plot was brief, characters were shallow and it just ended suddenly. Ugh! What a waste of time."
1,Not up to the Scarpetta novel standards,"I have been a big fan of Ms. Cornwell for a long time and read every one of the Scarpetta novels. Unfortunately, At Risk is the first non-Scarpetta novel I have read (mostly because the content was intriguing) and have been sorely disappointed. I was disappointed with the story, the character development and the ""suspense"" factor of this novel."
1,Disappointing sorry but stick with Scarpetta novels,I've tried a few different novels by Patricia Cornwell and I really only enjoy the Scarpetta books. The rest are almost amature hour! Sorry while I count down to the next release I could and probably will not buy another non Scarpeta novel.
1,well below average,"What a disappointment ! Very poorly written, gaping plotholes and very hard to believe story. Very thin, flimsy book that was very quick and easy to read. I felt cheated by the money and tims spent on it. It was obviously a book which had to be written quickly to make the publisher a quick buck. Rushed and poor. Very bad character development"
1,Please don't bother.,"While the characters of Win Gerano, his Nana, D.A. Monique Lamont, and Detective Sykes are very well drawn and interesting, the plot/mystery of this book is not. Just when I thought we were getting to the end of the 'exposition' portion of the book, we were having the whodunit explained to us...as well as the political machinations behind it. Also of annoyance: the fact that almost every character has a nickname, and Win has two!I was just confused the whole time I was reading this book, and for the kind of book one reads for escape purposes, one doesn't want to have to think so hard. Not a fan, won't be obtaining more of this series."
1,Disappointing,Normally I love Patricia Cornwell but honestly this book really made me wonder what had happened. Maybe I have been spoiled by the Scarpetta series but this book didn't seem as well thought out and I never did connect with the characters. It seemed rushed and at all times I remembered I was reading instead of getting caught up in the action. I love to reread books but can honestly say that 'At Risk' will stayed archived in my Kindle and not be revisited.
2,"Very boring, shallow book",I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's books and this one is by far the worst. I was disappointed that the character development was so poor. Usually she allows us to get to know the men and women in her books as if we were old friends...or enemies! Plus I never got that feeling of being there like I have with her other books. I'm particularly disappointed as I usually pass my Cornwell books along to my grown sons and this time I'd feel better just trashing it!
2,"Interesting Characters, Poor Plot Development","This is new series (not Kay Scarpetta). Although the characters are interesting the story is short and not well developed.Winston Garano is called out of forensics school to solve a decades old crime. His boss, Monique Lamont, is using the case to further her political career. Before he can even get started, strange events happen, followed by an act of violence. Politics, personal lives and crime are intertwined in this story."
5,Great Read,At Risk was a great read. It was a mystery combined with humor and wonderful character's. Nana being my favorite! I think a lot of the one star's are due to Scarpetta and her crew not being in At Risk. It does good to have a change of character's every now and then. GREAT READ!
1,Don't bother with this one,"I should have read the jacket cover more thoroughly becasue I did not know it was just a serialization. I am on a negative roll with books because this is the second disappointment in the last few weeks when reading some of my favorite authors.Anyway, this is useless trash - I agree with the reviewer who stated that this cannot be the same person who wrote all those execllent books early in her career. Pat, you don't need the money so why did you put this out. It is poorly written, hardly edited, makes no sense and leaves you scratching your head and looking at your empty wallet.Do yourself a favor and skip it. Let me be disappointed for you."
3,At Risk,"Most people posting reviews have a very negative view of this book. This is not Cornwell's typical work as At Risk was written as part of a 15 part serial for the New York Times Magazine. At Risk is the title of a crime initiative being implemented by a female district attorney who plans to run for governor. She wants one of her investigators to reopen and solve a 20-yr. old murder case in another state using new DNA technology. Then the district attorney herself becomes a crime victim. It is a short novel, and it can be read in a couple of hours, but it keeps moving and held my interest."
1,Not good.,"I have read and bought all of Patricia Cornwell's books. I used to be a huge fan, although less and less. But this book- I don't think I have read anything worse in my life. It looks like it took her all of five minutes to write it. I didn't finish it, I left in on the plane, and it will be a long, long time before I will ever read anything by Ms Cornwell again. If I could, I would like to get my money back, this book isn't even worth the paper it is written on.Suze, Holland."
1,At Risk a waste of money and time,"I was SO excited to see a new Patricia Cornwell book. As i started reading it, i couldn't get hold on the story line and started wondering if SHE really wrote this book or if someone else did and she unfortunately put her name on it. I have loved every book she has written but this book is junk. Information pops up that appears to have been brought up earlier, but it hasn't, and the characters never fully develop. Usually i donate my used books, but i got to the end and threw it in the trash. I will read reviews of her next book before i invest money in it - maybe she has lost her touch - or can't focus anymore. What a shame."
1,Disappointed again,"This book is very disappointing. What's it about anyway?? Patricia Cornwell should stop mass-writing her books and get down to writing books that have a story line, entertain and keep the reader absorbed. Bring back Kay Scarpetta; at least that's a page turner! A 212 page book selling for $21.95 NEW IS OUTRAGEOUS! It not worth $10. used. Predator a bit better, but not much."
1,simply terrible,"This is a terrible novel: no characterization, mean spirited, pointless, and silly. There is not one element of plot or character to latch onto here."
1,What a Disappointment!,"This is the first Patricia Cornwell book I've read and probably my last. I always heard good things about this author so was excited to buy this new book. I kept waiting and waiting for the plot to start but it just never does; the characters are weak, the storyline non-existent. I wouldn't recommend ""At Risk"" at all."
1,Shallow,"I was extremely disappointed in this latest Cornwell book. Usually her novels are filled with suspenseful information. With every turn of the page I hoped it would improve but it did not. At the end, I felt that I had wasted my time. This book has the depth of a 12 year old. Ms. Cornwell started out writing her books with a central character - Kay Scarpetta and they were great whodunits. But somewhere she got lost - adding in hi-tech gadgets and people you didn't want to know or care about. Please get Kay Scarpetta back to a Crossing Jordan type plot."
1,"Ms. Cornwell, Please Treat Your Fans Better!","Like almost everyone else, I was disappointed by AT RISK. This book features almost no character development, a silly plot, and a downer of an ending. Many of the characters and situations in this book are just plain unpleasant.AT RISK started as a serialized short story in The New York Times Magazine. The book is a little over 200 pages and the print is very large. This book therefore reads quickly: I finished it in under two hours. Despite this fact, it is being sold as a full-fledged novel at a $21.95 price tag. Ms. Cornwell, you need to treat your fans better than this! We expect more book for our money.It's a shame this book hit #1 on the bestseller list when there are so many better crime novels out there. My only solace was that I checked this book out from the library, and didn't waste my hard-earned money on it."
1,Ugh...,"I'm happy to see that Cornwell has again deviated from Scarpetta and Lucy and Benton (the once wonderful, but now stale group of paranoid narcisists). Winn is fresh and has the potential to be an interesting and enduring character. Too bad that once she strays outside the world of autopsy and forensic medicine, Cornwell loses her knack for criminal motivation. The bottom line motivation of one of the characters isn't right...[PSEUDO SPOILER ALERT]...There's no way that the hot prosecutor could have been guilty of insider trading. And I find it surprising that Cornwell would ever intentionally let her genius characters believe that."
1,Very Disappointed,"I cannot believe this book was written by Patricia Cornwell. I have enjoyed all of the Kay Scarpetta series books, but this one was an extreme disappointment. It was like reading a book that was written by a first time author, a book that should never have made it to publishing.I felt the book was rushed and just thrown together. It had potential, but obviously wasn't a priority for the author. Probably just wanted to meet a deadline.Save your money and yourself from being let down."
1,"""At Risk"" is a disappointment","I agree with most of the reviews, this is not Ms Cornwell's quality work. It almost seems like someone els wrote it and used Pat's name to get it on the shelf. If I had written this book, it would never have been published.Sorry Pat. I love your work and I've read them all, but not this time."
2,Yawn...,"The length and depth of this novel is better suited for publication in a magazine. I am sorry that I had paid as much as I did for this book. It was NOT up to Cornwell's usual par! If this was an attempt to feel out an audience for a new storyline with new characters, then magazine publication would have been better; many readers will hesitate to buy her new books in the future if they feel that they are being used as guinea pigs."
1,Not worth the money,"It appears to me that Patricia Cornwell is getting tired of her genre, and is simply spitting the books out now to fulfill a contract. At least, that is how it seems to me after reading this last book. The murderer was introduced mid-way through the slim volume-and it was so obvious! The main characters were implausible. When I opened the first page and saw how big the print was, I realized that I had just been taken for $7.99. It took me less than an afternoon to read this disappointing novel. Patricia, your last good book was Jack the Ripper-Case Closed. Maybe you should start writing non-fiction; I would be willing to read some of that."
1,A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"I waited for this book to come out all spring. Being a Cornwell fan I ASSUMED she would deliver the same spell binding ""can't put it down"" effect she always does. Not so! This book was a total disappointment. If this were the first PC book I had ever read, I'd never pick another one up. PC: If you are reading these reviews.. let us know what happened? Pull it back together and give us what we expect! When the writing is GOOD, we will have no problem letting you know!Disappointed in Indiana"
3,I didn't think the book was that bad,"I love reading Patricia Cornwell books, and looked forward to this one. I've been waiting for some time for Ms. Cornwell to find new characters since I think the ones in the Kay Scarpetta series are getting tired and worn. Winston Garano shows some promise as a main character, and I liked his sidekick ""Sykes"". There are still some good forensics in the book as well. We have a high flying district attorney who will do anything to win the position of Governor, and she has some unexplainable hold on Win. We also have a cold case that really ""heats Up"" when Win and Sykes are put on it. There are many twists and turns in the plotbefore this short book comes to a close."
2,Just Not Very Good,I'm not writing a plot summary. It's above from Amazon or the other reviewers. I want to say I really do love most of Patricia Cornwell's books. This one just wasn't one of her best and it wasn't even good enough for me to let her slide. This book had holes in the plot. It felt like it was thrown together. The characters weren't developed and the book wrapped up so fast. You can tell this was just a book that she did for money or for the publishers to just get out of her contract quicker. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because it is not part of a series like Scarpetta so you can do without it.
1,Oh Dear!,"Really a novella...or as stated originally a 15-part series (a serial thriller?). Very thin...with some wrong facts pertaining to Cambridge, MA. At best a beach read."
1,At Risk,I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books with pleasure. This book however does not even read like SHE wrote it. It is very amateurish writing. I cannot believe this came from her. It is nothing like the rest of her books!What happened?
2,It had possibilities,but half way through the plot just sputters and dies. I thought that Cornwell was spinning another of her early conspiracy-type plots that made Scarpetta great (before she became a pale imitation of herself) but she did not develop the plot or characters at all. With more emphasis on the plot and character development this book could have been pretty decent. I get the impression that P. Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta has gone the way of Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake. They both have become characters that you can't bring yourself to care about any more.
3,Not up to her standards . . .,"I have read each one of Patricia Cornwell's books. As a great fan of Dr. Scarpetta I found this book to be although likeable, not up to her standards. I read her books because of the forensic twists and medical expertise/knowledge that is so intriquing and is not found elsewhere with other fiction writers. At Risk didn't provide that level of detail in the plot and the main characters were, well, common."
1,Like most everyone else under contract?,Yet another author falling under the pressure to release a book? (Patterson has made a career out of it with books that have 30% blank space and barely any meat to the text). Read it in 1 day. What a waste of money. Appears to just be thrown out there so she can release something.Big mistake Ms. Cornwell. I will not buy any more of your books and I think many people feel the same way. What a cheap shot by a previously trustworthy author!
1,Totally disgusted,"this one is a ""throw-away"". DON'T waste your time! An insult to her readers!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Readers are the ones at risk,"I once thought I was a Patricia Cornwell fan, but no longer...too many disappointments lately. Yes, she's getting something published and to market, but it's no longer worth the time or money I was once willing to invest. This mediocre - and very short - read should have stayed in the pages of a magazine. I can only agree thoroughly with all the other one star reviews. Cornwell is no longer writing well; she seems to simply fulfill contract demands and not readers' expectations."
2,it is ok,this was certainly not one of Cornwell's best works. IT was almost like a couple of possible novels rolled into one. It read like a draft for a novel rather tahn a complete novel.
1,Will never buy again....,"I am thru buying Cornwell's books. I have said this before, and will not say it again...I feel like her books are only fulfilling a contract obligation and we are buying unfinished, rushed product."
1,Is there a rating less than 1 star?,"This book was so bad that I couldn't finish it. I'm convinced that either Cornwell didn't write her earlier books, she's not writing her more recent books or whatever talent she had at one time has left the room. I won't waste my money buying any more of her newer books because I've been burnt more than once. Don't waste your money buying this book...just reread one of her earlier Kay Scarpetta books. That's when she had talent,"
1,A huge disapointment...,"I cant believe I waited for this book! dont bother reading it. Wait for her next novel, she needs to stick to her original characters."
1,Not at all what I would expect from Cornwell....,"I have been a Patricia Cornwell fan for many years, reading and re-reading everything she has out there. I won't be re-reading this one. The plot is very disjointed and slap hazard. The characters unremarkable and very unmemorable. It seemed to me the book was written in an evening, sloppily. Definitely not even worth it for a light reading session on the beach or waiting in a doctor's office. I was extremely disappointed in this one."
1,What a waste!,"I love Patricia Cownwell so I could not wait to get this book. Talk about a waste of time and money! It was one of her worst books ever! Why did she throw together a book like that, made no sense what so ever.Very disappointed with her..."
3,What's all the fuss about?,"I read reviews on this site and was not encouraged to read At Risk. However, I saw it on the shelf at the library and decided to take a chance, since I usually see things differently than the vast majority. Quite honestly, I enjoyed this story. It wasn't long, it wasn't highly intense, but neither was it filled with some of the things, such as graphic sexuality, that have caused me to grow frustrated with recent Cornwell works. This isn't a Kay Scarpetta novel. Don't expect it to be one. To me it has the feel of ""Patricia Cornwell meets Law and Order."" It's a comfortable story that wraps itself up in about an hour. I enjoyed it enough that I will probably add it to my own library to read again."
2,At Risk Is a So-So Thriller,"I will start by saying something positive- I only spent $5.97 on At Risk.That aside, I'd like to ask Patricia Cornwell why all her empowered female characters are either depressed, bitchy and/or neurotic? What's wrong with strength without the quasi-criminal behavior? The only characters I really liked were Sykes, Nana and Miss Dog.The ""sensational"" cold case murder should've been solved twenty years ago without a lot of trying. A spurned lover decides to take down a female DA by planting a missing file in her house and have her murdered. And I guess we're supposed to believe that officers of the law have unlimited powers outside their home states to investigate crimes.Thumbs down!"
2,Review by Nan Kilar and Bob Miller,"Monique Lamont is the DA in Boston; she's aggressive, demanding and self-centered. Winston Garano (Win) is a Massachusetts State Police investigator assigned to Lamont; he's a loner and questions her motives. She's called him back from a class at the National Forensic Academy in Nashville to stick him with a cold Tennessee case that she thinks will look good for her and the smarmy Massachusetts governor. At Risk is the governor's (really Lamont's) new crime initiative to get offenders off the street so society is less at risk.Win phones a colleague at the seminar to look into the cold Nashville cash. He's stuck in Boston because when he went to Lamont's house to tell her he was quitting, he killed a scumbag who'd raped and was about to murder her. These two subplots are brought together in this rather bland read."
3,"New Character ""WIN"" is exciting","The book was short, but I read it cover to cover in one day. The best part was the new chacter WIN and his grandmother. Interesting relationship and very buildable for future sequels. Never did figure out if grandma was black or Italian - did you?"
2,Not only is the book at risk. . .,"Cornwell is usually a capable author, but in this case, she's not. Not that many major characters, but I got the impression they were changing masks. The plot is clear enough, but the writing is something else.If you buy the paperback used from Amazon with something else, and pay 1 cent for a used copy, that's a reasonable price. If you buy the hardcover copy, then you should buy the Brooklyn Bridge!I was not impressed with ""At Risk."""
4,I LIKED IT,"Maybe there is something wrong with me, but I liked it. It was a fast read, but I thought the detective was interesting and would like to see his character return. Maybe with more development. After reading POSTMORTEM, I lost interest in Kay Scarpetta."
3,Too short,As a huge fan of Ms. Cornwell I was left feeling dissappointed in the final chapter. I wanted more and the characters were so richly set up that they easily could have provided more. I can only hope that Ms. Cornwell writes more books w/ these characters much the way we've been able to follow Kay Scarpetta's life.
5,Thank you so much!,The book showed up quick and in great shape! Thank you so much for this great purchase!!!
1,STOP!! Read the reviews first,"I happened on this book while just browsing in a bookstore and because I have enjoyed Cornwell's writing in the past, bought it without reading any reviews. I have learned my lesson. I was totally disappointed and felt that the story had absolutely no depth and was poorly written. She (Cornwell) would have been better off to trash this one, as I am sure that this book will give many of her fans a real cause to pause before buying another of her books. A real waste of time and money."
1,"If you must, get it from the library!","Okay, I was hard headed! Despite the bad reviews, I got the audio version of this book from my local library and transferred it to my iPod to listen on my daily commute. Figured it couldn't be that bad, being only 4 hours. Boy, was I wrong! Didn't even finish half of it! Not only was the storyline choppy and sporatic, the narration was awful! Even Kate Reading couldn't make it sound good.Publishers should have left well enough alone and kept it as a magazine series.So, if you insist on giving this one a try, get it from the library!"
1,Cornwell Definitely At Risk,"First and foremost, I HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK. And I'll not read it based on the reviews posted here and my reading of her last Scarpetta debacle, ""Predator."" I do believe Cornwell has lost her touch. Case in point, her last two Scarpetta offerings, while fairly well-written and suspenseful through the majority of the books, the endings were simply anti-climatic and bordering on farcical. I think it time that Ms. Cornwell take a break, read reviews such as these & take them to heart, and go back to her literary roots that made her an outstanding author. I only hope she can do so as for now, she's been removed from my 'must read' list."
1,Disappointed!!!,"I have been in love with Patricia Cornwell's books for several years. This could not have been written by her! Is she ok, alive, in a hospital somewhere, has anyone seen her lately? If you really did put your name on this book Patricia, take a long vacation and get over whatever your problem is. A very disappointed fan. Mark H. Wynn, Hawaii"
1,AT RISK FOR BOREDOM,"Just an awful book..I wont even go into the details it's not worth my breath. Cornwell has completely lost her way..her last few books have been simply terrible on every level..I was happy when i read the jacket of this book and realized that it was not a scarpetta book..i mean she has absolutely ruined that series..i could care less what happens to any of those characters..and frankly after this book i will not read another cornwell book period..if she had any shame she would return her hefty advance and retire, she's become a hack of the lowest order, i have never witnessed an author deteriorate so rapidly, it's all very odd, but alas i'm through with her forthwith."
1,Cromwell Light,"The book was underdeveloped. I was surprised that someone hadn't bothered to proofread it, as well. Like many other Cromwell fans, I bought the book, because it had her name on it. I wish I hadn't. I love reading, but I didn't enjoy reading this book.The book is written as if someone had jotted down a story line and just wrote it out. There is no depth. The reader can not emotionally connect with the characters. It is similar to drinking nonalcoholic beer, flat and disappointing.Many of my favorite authors are writing in a similar manner. They are just cranking the books out. I don't know if it is their fault, or that they are doing it under pressure from their publishers, but it has to stop.If you like well written mysteries, try Harlen Coben."
1,Cornwell has lost the ability to write,"Sample sentence from page 2:""Big raindrops feel like irritable fingers tapping the top of his head and he is overcome by anxiety as he stands on the old red-brick walk in the midst of the old red-brick Yard, looking up and down Quincy Street, watching people spew past in cars and on bicycles, a few on foot and hunched under umbrellas.""If this had been the opening sentence it would have been worthy of a Bulwer-Lytton award.It didn't improve much beyond that. Not a sympathetic character in sight. Even the hero cop who gets emasculated by his bitchy female boss takes out his aggression on a poor cabby by shoving a badge under his nose and then underpaying the fare because the ""middle-eastern"" driver didn't know the destination and needed directions.Not much character development. Not much plot. Almost no forensics. Thankfully short."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This book reads like it was written over a long, boring weekend. The plot is convoluted and the characters are shallow and forgettable, except for one of the main character's grandmother, Nana, and Miss Dog, the blind and deaf stray.The book jacket contends that ""sparks fly, traps spring, twists abound..."" This is definitely not the ""master working at the top of her game."""
1,Losing her touch.,Read this over Memorial Day weekend and I ended up recalling the memories of when Patricia Cornwell didn't just churn them out. Let's take this and everything James Patterson has written since 1999 and toss it far far away. Don't waste your time here. Read WINTER HILL by Matthew Farrell or THE HUSBAND by Dean Koontz instead.
1,Eew.....,'Nuff said: the other negative reviewers have summarized it well.Well-written Cornwells: RIP.....
1,"0 stars, actually","This is a badly written, superficially conceived short story. Sadly, it is not a novel and it is not worth the money."
1,Not her best,"Cornwell's writing started out as great reading. Plot, characterization and style all contributed to books we looked forward to collecting. In the last couple of Scarpetta books, it seemed she stopped liking her characters and came up with implausible twists.In 'At Risk' - she denigrates all the characters as they're introduced and the writing style itself is choppy. It's going back to the library unread. Not surprising the wait list is long but the wait isn't."
2,not familiar enough,I usually love Patricia Cornwell's stuff but now it seems that she is getting so far away from her main character base that it all seems strange. I am a funny reader and when I like something I like it to seem semi familiar. This book felt odd and I didn't finish it. sorry.
2,Disappointed Reader,"I was on vacation and looking for a good read, so I bought my first Patricia Cornwall mystery. I found the present tense somewhat offsetting, but I continued to read through to the end. I've got to say, the promotional blurb on the back cover promising ""chilling suspense, rich characters, and trademark forensics that have made Patricia Cornwell an international phenomenon"" were pretty much just ""hype."" I had difficulty resonating to any of the characters and I found the plotting very disappointing. Disappointed Reader!"
2,"You're ""At Risk"" for boredom if you read this book","I'm a fan of Patricia Cornwell and I'm familiar with her writing. I was happy to pick this up in an airport and figured it would be a quick, fascinating read. The book was, indeed, quick, but the writing and plot were substandard at best. I kept wanting to slap myself every time I turned the page, irritated at how bad the story was, but even more irritating was that I kept hoping it would get better! This was just not book material and not up to Cornwell's regular standards. This won't keep me from buying another one of her books, but I'll definitely check out reviews first and not buy blindly. Read this book ""At"" your own ""Risk."""
1,Too Bad There Isn't A No Star Rating,"Either this book was written by a hired hack or Patricia Cornwell has sunk to the bottom of the literary barrel. I had given up on reading her books as they gradually and then precipitously deteriorated but this book ""beats all"". I bought it because of the setting, my home town of Boston. I actually threw it in the trash rather than ""recycling"" it at my local used book store. I would never inflict it on another unsuspecting reader. Buyer beware, you are indeed at risk - of throwing your money away. Both the author and publisher should be ashamed of this fraud perpetrated on their customers. Never again!"
1,Waste of Money,"When the book arrived, I knew something was wrong. It was very thin, not like the usual Cornwell books. And after reading it, all I could say was: What were you thinking Patricia. It was a waste of my time and my money. How disappointing, as her books are always greatly anticipated (since she got rid of those folks in Charlotte NC) and this was such a let down. Please Patricia, don't do this to your loyal readers again.ellijaygirls"
3,A Plane Read!,"I think because this was born as a series for a newspaper, it lacks the continuity of her other novels."
4,This Womans Opinion,"I personally loved this book. I read it in high school. It gives you a clear view in how controlling abusive men go about peeking there prey. This books touchings on alot of things young woman should look out for when dating a male. It shows how jealouse and little acts can really develope into a seriouse problem. I would recomend this book to young woman everywhere. This might even help them realize they are in a extremely seriousely troubled relationship, and that there is help for them. All and all this book is terrific in my opinion."
4,Too Many Forgivings,"Past Forgiving is a book about a 15 year old girl named Alex. She has finally found out that she is in a troubling relationship with her boyfriend, Cliff. She has forgiven him one too many times for what he has done to her! Cliff is abusive, and he has a very bad temper. Everyday of her summer life she is trying to work, while keeping her family, best friend, and Cliff happy! I personally think that this book is great. The characters are great and the story is awesome. I would recomend this book to young readers. To find out what happens between Cliff and Alex read this book!"
4,past forgiving,"this book kind of ends in a real cliff hanger. I really want to know what happens next. I mean where's the sequel??? It's bothering me so much. If it had a sequel I'd give it 5 stars. well, thats all I've got to say."
1,cheap quality,"received this item as a gift and am very disappointed in the construction. The joints where the rod sections come together and where the top metal section joins the rods are very visible. No amount of adjustment will get the lamp to set perfectly straight on the base. I think the metal threads on the base are not set straight or are partially stripped, so i can't even thread it on completely, and a section of the silver thread shows at the base."
5,Little bit will do it,"I first used this product when it came in a free trial size and found out that a little dab is all I needed to wash my face completely (the trial size lasted ""forever""). I am in my 50's but still have oily skin and get an occasional blemish or blackhead..but not if I use Shiseido Purifying foam every night before bed. The product make my face feel ""squeeky-clean"", so if you have dry skin, this may not be the product for you."
4,Little lantern big light!,"I bought the UCO candle lantern value pack. It arrived quickly and has impressed me with the quality of brightness the candle lantern puts out. The side mounted reflector aids in this. I was surprised that a small lantern produced such a big light. I am sure that I will get a lot of use from this product.It is a handy compact size, which adjusts to the length of the candle.It is easily stowed away in the included protective pouch.Even strong winds do not affect it's flame and brightness.Makes a good addition to my camping equiptment.Amoung my reasons for purchasing this item,there are no batteries or bulbs to worry about.Although it came with a 3 pack of candles,I bought an extra set of these.Now I can go a long way off the trail and be assured of dependable light.I am happy with my UCO candle lantern,look forward to using it more often. Larry"
1,Junk,"Flimsy little candle that doesn't fit together properly. Dangerous if your in the woods as the lower part will fall off the upper, doesn't attach properly. I am shocked at the positive feed back. I was very very disappointed. extremely cheaply made, not worth $5 much less $30.00."
3,Paperback Book,Not all that great and clearly not up to a lot of the DragonLance books but if you don't have anything else pressing to read and enjoy this type of book its worth a read. Not good but not quite lame either.
4,Great Twist,"This is a great book. Someone said this should be sci-fi, but I disagree. Sci-fi IS Fantasy. W+H make a radical but verosimile twist to the story, that just can bring more power to it and fulfill the Prophecy. The ending is great, I mean the climax. The post-climax, is ... too much blah-blah and explanations. But, all other is just great. Thing is, if you just want a repeated structure of fantasy and cliched heroes, this is not the book. This one keeps all the ""Mythic hero"" structure found in 99% of this kind of books, but with many changes."
4,Everything just crumble,"In the middle of chaos, a greater chaos is born. Technology and magic crash with deadly accuracy. The pace never slow down in this final book. In fact, there are some scenes where I wanted to jump into the book and help the magi. But it lacks some explanation on a couple of things: like Saryon close encounter with ""someone or something"" and the identity of Simkin, the last will burrow in my mind for the rest of my life. Shame on Margaret and Tracy for that. Joram's old character returned too forcefully, helping the trama go along. Oh well, I suppose some endings are set before the characters has anything to say about it."
2,Forcing myself to finish this one....,"First two books of the trilogy? Terrific. Great characters, interesting world, etc. And then came the third book. What possessed them to plunge laser-shooting tanks in the middle of this great fantasy world? As others have said, the book suddenly becomes...well, part of another series, in my opinion. I love Weis & Hickman, but this book's a disappointment. Judging from the other reviews, though, you'll either love it or hate it. Don't let this series turn you off to the authors; read Death Gate or any of their Dragonlance books!"
2,Don't get your hopes up with this book,"I'm a fantasy reader, and I believe that this book shouldn't be put under the fantasy section. The first to were great fantasy novels, but this is science fiction. They could have ended it in a better way."
2,Expected more...,"With the previous books being so great I expected a culmination for the trilogy. It seems as it was written by another person that hasn;t seen the previous ones. She mixes up things between science and magic and if this is not enough you are forced to complain for such an ending. I finished the book and stayed 5 minutes in silence trying to understand how could they ruin an excellent pair of books, then i realized: a Horrible end in the third one."
1,"Wait, what the heck just happened?","Okay, let me be fair...the first two books were pretty good. Actually, when Garald taught Joram how to fence in Doom of the Darksword, I found that to be one of the greatest scenes in fantasy I've read lately. HOWEVER...what the heck happened? It's like, Joram leaves and then comes back and they don't explain it and why the heck is he friends with the military and who is Menju and what's wrong with Gwen, and, we all want to know, who the heck is Simkin? This book is lame lame lame lame!!! I read fantasy to escape from the toils of life (lol) and man, there was like Desert Storm happening in this book. Honestly, I expected Stormin' Norman to show up and save the day. This book is like a bad dream. It's awful too since the first two were so great!!! Read the first two, and like one of the other reviewers said, make up your own ending. Oh yeah, and they never explained why the people procreate like they do..."
2,what!!!!,"quitre possibly the weakest, most badly written ending I have ever read on a series... it was so bad it made me swear off any further books by the author... i just don't want to invest time in a book or series that might have such a marginal payoff at the end.."
4,Slow in Spots,"Warren Buffett, in his review of ""Winning,"" wrote ""no other management book will ever be needed.""Unfortunately, I found the book slow in some sections which is why I rated it four stars. Likely, it was slow because I am not currently in a management position and found much of the material hard to relate with."
2,Little dents,"Unfortunately this book was a bit ruined owing to little dents all over the cover plus a bigger one right at the bottom of it. I know it might happen, but still as customer something to complain about.Antonio"
1,"Sickening, Horrible, better term may loosing...","I was carefully going line by line to find out where is the hidden message for winning. After going through the book I was trying hard to recollect where is the clue for winning in this book. Most of the stuff in this book are not new, you will find them everywhere in other business books.it looks like author try hard to hire only winners. In his hiring process, he hired 50% winners initally, then later in his career , he sharpened the process to hire 80% winners. As per his strategy, those 20% who are not winners, whom he hired by mistake are ""let Go"" (Authors term for firing...)I have read many such books, I never had a sickening feeling like this book. There is nothing motivational or new info in this book.I would request the author to withdraw this book from market and rewrite with civiliased strategies for winning.."
1,Pull that review,"A colleague of mine wrote a well written, concise, albeit critical review here as well, not just about the book, but it's co-authors Jack and Suzy Wetlaufer, (the latest Mrs. Welch.) Mysteriously, it too was pulled several times despite it's being reworked. Not sure what's up with that, or more importantly, Amazon. No doubt Jack's paid flacks/lawyers are working overtime on this site. Here's a winning thought that Jack and Suzy would surely love shoved down our throats - Who needs the truth and freedom of speech?Now who here doesn't love these two winners?"
1,Don't Bother,"This is just regurginated truisms from every business book I have ever read, He even manages to steal one of Harvey Mckay's quotes and re writes the quote to make it seem different"
2,Is the spin doctor in?,"GE is a true corporate success story, and Jack Welch clearly deserves the credit for developing the dynamic and goal focused culture that made GE what it is. As a CEO, Jack Welch was a ""tough guy"" who played by the rules, and that's something to be admired. Still, Welch's first book ""Straight From The Gut"" also revealed that Jack is all about Jack. Not surprising, therefore, to see that this book is more about reinventing Jack (and Suzy) than anything else. Both took quite a hit to their reputations over the last few years, due to incredibly bad judgment and self-serving ethical lapses while in leadership positions. What better way to turn this around than to claim to be gurus on the topic of winning with integrity...the ultimate self spin-doctoring. For those who worship Jack for being Jack, I'm sure this book will have appeal. But for a book on true winning leadership styles, read Andy Grove's ""Only The Paranoid Survive"", and leave this one on the shelf."
5,Excellent,"Any body who wants to become entreprenuer should listen to this CD. As his previous book ""Straight from the Guts"" gives listner a guide line on how to become better mangers. This time it is more personal."
5,A Masterful Book for Everyone,"I can't tell you how totally invigorating and inspiring and most of all, useful, this book is. At last, a book about business that draws us all in, and gives us all the tools we need to excel. Jack Welch is a powerfully honest witness to the power of honesty. Furthermore, he is brilliant without calling attention to his brilliance, and he is prescriptive without ever seeming condescending. Written with verve and punch, this books is also deeply thoughtful and wrung from experience. This book will benefit all who read it--and many who don't, as the proceeds are all going to charity. Jack and Suzy Welch have given us a superb book, inspiring, true, and what's more,fun."
3,Its okay,overal good book. had to read if for class. I liked some aspect of the book but didn't feel like I had to read this book to know those things. the 70-20-10 rule is not something I would implement in my busines.
4,A review of the Winning by Jack Welch from a Saudi Reader,"The book is constructed in a way that makes you not willing to stop reading it.It comes with a breadth and depth of experience.Mr. Welch is a a symbol of capitalism and emphasizes many times in his book that ""there is no place in GE for non-winners, once you loose your winning capability it is time to leave the company"" , i think it is simple as that.Otherwise, the books comes with very instructive and direct to the point views on various issues, from staffing, to promotion, to dealing with the middle class of any company.Any business related person should read the book, you don't have to agree on everything!"
4,Very Insightful,"Read through this book fairly quickly because it was well written. I found myself highlighting many of the passages and went through an entire highlighter. This is one of those books you definately want to read more than once. He gives you the information in a ""Cookie Monster"" style format, so information is digested easily and isn't construed as ""Rocket Science."" I'm a former NCO, and newly commissioned Lieutenant in the AF, and am always searching for tools and resources to better help me in my development as a professional and as a person, this book served, and satisfied both of these needs."
3,Read between the lines!,"Who wants to be a winner?Or rather, what makes a winner?Reading this book superficially anf you will enjoy Jack's take on a variety of issues from M&As; to Six sigma to candor. Yet you may come away somewhat disappointed especially if you want to know 'how to.'But read between the lines and you'll find that it is a winner's mentality that will set you apart from the pack. That is, your approach to various issues confronting you job, your career, your life.No doubt Jack's wealth of experience is something one can learn from, and the reader is well advised to open his/her mind to the infinite possibilities."
5,Inspirational,"Jack Welch is considered by many to be the man, who transformed leadership. I do not fully agree with them, as he is the one who was able to blend best virtues of the ""old school"" and modern leadership.Welch's book ""Winning"" is the best of what he has written and offers a perfect mix of both his biography and his managing strategy. As he transformed ""General Electric"" to the new heights, every word written should be remembered as Welch, what I really like about him, does not beat around the bush and goes straight to the point.To sum it up, it is worth reading for every manager and every willing-to-be-soon-a-manager. In the end - tip for the lazy (or hurrying) ones: most important topics are written in bold or as a separate list of rules, so it is sufficient to read only those."
4,Good Book...I've read better...I've read worse,"This is a decent book. I had to stop and ponder on a lot of the points he made and how it could be applied in my own business to which it has helped in one degree or another. As far as any negative reviews about the book, perhaps there was a bit too much fluff and not enough substance. In regards to all the negative reviews that have been written about this book, a quick search on Amazon of virtually any book will yield both 5 and 1 star reviews. It is all relative, I don't believe there are trully any business, management, self-help-type books honestly deserving of 5 stars."
5,Best Business Advice,"Jack's idea of 'candor' in the work place is the best advice I have heard. He speaks from experience and the mind set that it's not easy, but if you take the hard road the rewards are greater. I read the work a few years ago and just bought the audio for a refresher. Although I much perfer it when the author reads the book, his voice sounds strained. Anyone looking for new ideas of running a business would enjoy this book. ~KMS"
4,Great,Lots of short and sweet chapters and lots to learn from this book. I enjoyed it and felt like plenty of its concepts are helpful in my career. Would definitely recommend it.
2,"good ideas, terrible speaker","Mr. Welch is a great bussinessman. However, his abilities as a speaker are terrible. This audiobook should be read by a professional, not by the author."
3,I did not like it,"This is one of many books giving suggestions on how to run company more efficiently, I did not read anything I have not heard before."
3,a management bible-second testimony,"After long times of management career Mr. Welch, simply and briefly gives some tips for a successful business environment,hence; it is not an ""that`s it book"" Most of the styles of management can`t be applied to international and oversees company cultures."
5,Inspiring Management Book,"If you are looking for ways to win in your workplace, you'll have to do more than read this book. But if you want some simple, yet powerful and proven management practices, this is the book for you. I also recommend Eightstorm: 8-Step Brainstorming for Innovative Managers, as a dessert after consuming this 'Winning' main-course."
5,Fantastic Read from a Titan of Business,Jack presents the singular opportunity of sitting down with a mentor who has been through the battle and is willing to point out successful paths. I appreciate his willingness to be candid and vulnerable.
1,He left out a few important points...,"Looking at the way this phoney has actually lived his life, he forgot a few salient points: Dump the first wife for a younger dimmer model, get a bad eye job, and gorge yourself on the shareholders' dime, but do it legally. There, now we've got an honest look at Jack's philosphy of winning."
1,Boring Nonsense.,"WINNING is not destined to become the bible of business for generations to come, despite what the jacket declares. It ambiguously and laboriously gives confusing answers to the most easy, trivial questions people face on the job. Welch's aim is to lecture people at every level of the organization. His audience is clueless line workers, college students, MBAs, project managers and senior executives. He lays out obvious business ""principles"" and devotes most of WINNING to the pointless aspects work. Welch's grim, excuse-ridden mind set is boring. His goal is to hinder anyone and everyone who has a passion for success."
3,Good thoughts from a great leader,"This item arrived quickly and in good condition. Jack Welch is a great leader, but some of his ability and ideas about leading cannot be conveyed on the written page."
1,Can You Spell Class Action,"The Jack and Suzy show has fallen flat on its face. Welch'scoda, to fire 10% of the workforce every year, translates into massive age discrimination (you need ""vitality"" in your staff) in the workplace, and is currently the subject of a 15,000 person class action lawsuit against a major US corporation, which has the misfortune of being run by a runner-up in the succession sweepstakes ""won"" by Jeff Immelt. Ironically, the CEO of this company was 51 years old at the time of Welch's retirement, and was probably passed over for the top job because Immelt was 44. The abused become the abusers."
5,Excelent book,"This book is a great option for who wants to learn about management and relationship inside any enterprise. This is the first book I have read from Jack Welsh, but will not be the last one, actually I'm sure he was one of the best world managers."
4,HULKAMANIA (not that kind) RUNNING WILD,"This game is incredible. I am amazed at how much fun this is. The game play, control, and plot are well thought out and engaging. The really joy here is just the unabashed love of bashing. The PS2 graphics are not as good as the XBOX version, but still very enjoyable, and almost irrelevant as the game itself is so much fun. It's also great stress relief for 30 somethings...best game I've played in years."
4,Great fun for a five year old,"I bought this game for my five year old son for his birthday. He enjoys running around, smashing, and breaking things. It has held his attention pretty well, but the game lacks much of a theme or plot. If you just want to vent some hostility this game is for you, though."
3,Not for young kids (as rating clearly states),"Well, let me preface by saying I disregarded the teen rating and bought it for a 5 year old, so shame on me. But my son is very well grounded in reality and can handle other teen rated games. However, I think this one is past his limit due to the following factor:-there are no real goals except SMASH SMASH SMASH! You get points for everything from killing an innocent woman walking down the street to crushing a police car. Not a real good lesson for a 5 year old. Not a good scene to walk in on your kindergartner laughing his head off about crushing some folks on the sidewalk. Grand Theft, anyone?Yeah, I feel kind of lame for saying it's not for kid's since the label clearly states ""it's not for kids"", but we all know the teen rating is sometimes overly cautious. In this case, I think it's correct. And the sad thing is, I don't think any teen is going to enjoy such basic gameplay for long."
1,A Huge Disapointment,When I first played this game on the demo disc I thought it was pretty good but when play and beat the full game it's a whole different experience. This game is pointless and pretty horrible in about every possible. I'm not sure why its highly rated by some people.The Good-action-soundThe Bad-Controls-Story-Pointless Objectives-Not everything is destrutible(only a few buildings are)-Trying to have fun can be a pain[...].-Lasting appealIf you are intrested in this game I highly recommand you rent it first before buying.
2,just another typical PS2 action game with bad graphics...,"if you're looking for something innovative or interesting, this game definitely isn't where to go.. you're the hulk, and you have to pick up cars, run up buildings, throw stuff... ya know. it actually sounds a lot more fun than it is in practice, to me at least. i didn't feel any visceral joy in the process. it felt like just another typical run-of-the-mill mediocre PS2 action game to me, and this game really shows how far superior the XBOX's graphics are to PS2's. compare the graphics of ninja gaiden to this game.. there is simply no contest."
4,the perfect title,"In spiderman 2, you could roam around. In hulk ultimate destruction you can roam around. In spiderman 2 you cant be bad or hurt anybody on the street. In the hulk:UD, you can do so. in spiderman 2 it is not that much fun to roam around. In the hulk it is. get this game if you are at least 10 years old. Definitly buy this game if you experiance stress at all! I strongly recomend this game. Buy it!"
2,Maybe I'm in the minority...,"...but I found this game to be rather . . . boring.I bought it after reading amazing reviews from Playstation Magazine, IGN, and Game Informer.I just couldn't get into it.The moves seemed repetitive to me.The graphics, even for PS2, were lacking.The gameplay was very weak.I'll play this game for a few hours, put it back on the shelf, and not touch it for 8 months.I'll give it another try, and the same thing will happen.I won't touch it for 8 months.Maybe I'm in the minority on this one.I just regret buying this game.I really wanted to like it.I just didn't."
4,Blown away with all this information,"This is a very technical book. Loads of details. Eye opening for any amature thinking ""Oh, I'll just get a windmill and I won't have any more electric bills!"" Worth reading if you really want to produce green electricity. You need considerable land, about a year's worth the wind data for your particular site, more than a few thousand bucks, and even then, you may still find that it won't pay for itself. One thing I didn't think about is that ice can form on the blades and fling off- hitting your home, a neighbor's home, or a car...Is it a good book? Yes. Very clear, complete information on the topic."
3,Lots of information,"Indeed a lot of information on windpower, from mini-systems to full scale development and everything in between. Interesting reading, but too detailed for general reading (although using it as a reference document certainly is valuable) and not enough details if you really want to design or install your own full fledged system. However, if you plan to buy a unit, this book gives you lots information to prevent circumvent the pitfalls."
4,Very god book but..........,"This book is very good but the author need to go first from the general to the particular, specially in formulas. Going first from the particular then later jumping to the general formulas make the understanding kind of confusing.Also the formulas are written in smaller fonts than that used in the wording text, for me some times were difficult to read. I rather would save some space in some many post card type pictures and and use it for bigger fonts in the formulas.Other than this, the book is very good for a general understanding of wing power generation technology with so many graphs, tables, information, references and.... pictures.M Sanchez"
2,17.5-45mm Oh No!,"Even though this was remanufactured, the camera arrived in excellent condition. Unfortunately, the camera did not come as advertised. The camera was falsely advertised as having a 14-45mm lense. What you really get is a 17.5-45mm made in China cheap throw-away lense! This is not your typical Japan made high quality lense that is available in a new kit.Because the cheap lense is included, this isn't such a good deal."
1,Wrong Lens in the Box!!! Feels being Cheated!!,"The package has the worng lens 17.5mm - 45mm lens wherein you are supposed to get 14mm-45mm lens. The lens are cheap made in china and lowest quality. Amazon.com must note,that they are cheating their customer with wrong information.I called Olympus to check on the correct lens and they said all recertified/remanufactured kits comes with 17.5mm-45mm lens and Amazon.com was wrong in listings, its customers must and should return it back!!!Reviews about cameras are great, but amazon.com has cheated it long term customer today!!!"
4,My 7 year old LOVES this costume!,This costume is adorable. My child loves it. He puts it on all the time and it's not even Halloween yet.
3,Fun for a lazy afternoon,"We bought this kit for some summer fun. It was difficult to follow the directions (even my older teens had trouble - the bracelets do not come out like the patterns show) and it made pretty chunky bracelets. Also, if you make the floss lengths as directed, the bracelets are pretty short (will fit younger kids better) - they won't stay on the ""loom"" long enough to make them longer. Also, the loom isn't very sturdy and would bend and the slots got frayed after a few bracelets. My kids would have liked to make some skinnier styles but the kit only came with 4 wide patterns. It takes a lot of floss to make a bracelet so plan on buying extra floss if you want to make more than 4-5 bracelets. All in all, it was a good purchase but not something that will be used over and over again."
5,Cute,I sent this as a gift to my BFF daughter and she loves it!It is easy to use and learn (trust me on this one she lives in the Netherlands and did the instruction by picture only)She sent me a bracelet she made and let me tell you it looks like store bought and cute!
3,It's easier to make bracelets the old-fashioned way.,"My niece was bored with this wheel after a few minutes. My sisters and I used to make friendship bracelets when we were younger. We tried to use the wheel ourselves, but it was hard to remember what you were doing without constantly looking at the instructions. Needless to say, our designs came out looking like a rope instead of a bracelet."
3,Pretty simple overall,Our 10 year old thought this was pretty neat but it really is not a toy that keeps the interest long term. Probably great for a sleep over activity for the girls.
3,Good passtime for girls.,"I got this for my grand-daughter. She did enjoy it, but needed her mother's help."
2,Takes a loonnng time to make a bracelet,"I gave this to my 6 year old for Christmas. The directions are good and easy to follow, and once finished, the bracelets are nice. However, the process of making a friendship bracelet with the wheel is tedious and takes a long time. Once you've selected the pattern and colors, the process is not creative - you just repeat the same action over and over again. My daughter usually has a good attention span for arts and crafts, but not this one."
3,Granddaughter loved it!,I love the service ALWAYS of Amazon. It usually arrives SOONER than I expect...plus everything is AS IT WAS ORDERED. Great Company - plus good toy
4,Good educational toy but instractions are poor,"Interesting thing for my daughter but the instructions are not good at all. She found some on the Web and learned how to work with the square thing, but still can't do anything with the wheel.Katerina"
5,Make very pretty bracelets,"The bracelet made out of the friendship wheel is round and very professional looking. It has four patterns, one with little hearts, one with little diamonds, one with little flowers and one with stripes. I have made the one with little flowers and it is extremely pretty.The bracelets are very easy to make, and I made the bracelets while watching TV, keeps my hands busy. But keep in mind that I am a grown-up."
2,Very Complicated,This kit was purchased for an 8 year old girl...she was not able to do it without the help of her parent. The quality of the item was less than expected.
5,Great Gift,"Gave it to my niece for christmas, and she loved it, and crafting everyday.... Very easy and nice booklet comes with it."
5,"Wow, so easy it is unbelievable!","I bought this hoping to help my 13 YO daughter who was always attaching a safety pin to her leg while she wove her bracelets. I ended up buying two, one for her and one for her BFF. Totally worth the money and very easy to string several cool designs. Although it does take a few extra minutes to get the set up correct, it is worth the extra effort for the high quality designs and well constructed bracelets. I will be buying more of these for gifts."
3,Country Pop 1 Workout Music,"I was disappointed that this music is not sung by the artists who originally recorded these songs. The music and accoustics are not nearly as good, or motivating. I should have read more carefully the description, and I would have known these were not the original recording artists. My mistake!"
2,Weaker Every Read!,"A neat little book that could have been so much better.Joseph is licking Chicago's boots and glosses over some interesting facts that are known to anyone with minor interest in this great band -like the fact that guitarist Dawayne Bailey was sleeping with Walt Parazaider's daughter and that Robert Lamm can be difficult to work with. This book had no depth at all, no character and poor quality photos. There were also spelling mistakes, including unforgiveable spellings of well-known people (Phil Ramon - who he?)!"
1,What a ripoff.....,"I was looking forward to this book with great anticipation and was severely disappointed when it came out. There is little or no new material here that any good Chicago fan wouldn't already know and there are quite a few glaring factual omissions. The book totally ignores the 8 years of contributions made by guitarist Dawayne Bailey while spouting pages of info about Kiki Ebsen, a backup keyboard player on one tour. Most of the information in here seems to have been gleaned from the squeaky-clean view of the band that can be found on their web site. I was hoping for a book with a little more meat to it, not something that looks like it was published in someone's back room."
4,Chicago book a fitting tribute,"Ben Joseph's account of Chicago's vast body of work and long career in the music business should give all Chicago fans cause to celebrate. By avoiding any tabloid tell-all trashing of the group, his positive views go hand-in-hand with Chicago's musical persona all these years. Joseph did an excellent job gathering info about the band and providing new information, interviews and perspectives. Chicago has always been one of the world's greatest bands and it's about time someone gave them the tribute they deserve."
2,But not quite strong enough yet ...,"A book on Chicago ... long overdue, eagerly awaited, and yet bitterly disappointing. This book is not quite what it could, and perhaps should have been. Concentrating predominantly on the vast recording output of the esteemed horn-orientated band this unfortunately glosses over the true 'inside' story and sticks to the basic facts that many fans already knew. A short summary of this sparce tome could perhaps be simplified as ""they got together, they recorded an album, they numbered an album, they toured, someone left, someone joined ..."" and that is it. A great, missed opportunity to satisfy the thousands of admirers who still avidly follow and collect this American institution, and yet ... when all is said done, this appears to be all there is available so, ironically, this still makes it an essential purchase. Hmmm ..."
2,Chicago:A book written from album covers,"Being a huge Chicago fan, the first record(yes it was vinyl) I purchased was CTA, I was disappointed by Ben Josephs' book. Hardly anything new was learned from the book, that could not have been discovered from reading the album covers. As the members of the band are roughly my age, I want to know how they handled success, who did they marry, how did they invest their millions, what are their hobbies, how many children do they have... I want to know more than a list of albums and their ranking on Billboard. The book could have been so much more if it would have let us meet the individuals who are Chicago. I met Terry's widow on Behind The Music, but Ben's book didn't give me any new information about who these people are. The marketing gimick to create a band image worked well to make the producers of Chicago rich, but now is the time to show us the people of Chicago. Ben, give it another shot---tell us things we don't know..."
2,Chicago: Feelin' Stronger... An enjoyable read,"Ben Joseph's ""Chicago:Feelin' Stronger Every Day"" is an enjoyable read, and not without merit. It's been many years since I bought my first Chicago album, and I still love their music (mostly the early stuff CTA - Chicago VII). This book fills in a lot of holes in my memory, and has inspired me to go back to the albums and give another listen to some of the material not on my home-made minidisc compilations. I enjoyed the brief glimpses into what was going on behind the scenes of the group's early days; the book disappoints, however, in the one area that is most important to me: it fails to provide much discussion of the music itself. Chicago's sound is distinctive. The arrangements cannot be confused with any other horn band. A discussion, even non-technical, of how this sound was achieved and how they integrated all of the disparate elements was what I was hoping for."
2,Smith 3 stone sharpening system,"While the stones themselves are worth owning the holder for them is about as cheaply made as, well you could not imagine it being more lame. The next product up in price is substantially better made and will probably last a lifetime. This will deteriorate in a very short time due to the weakness of the plastic used to hold the stones. I would not recommend this product to a friend or family member."
4,Helmut Lotti goeas Classic,"This my first recording by this performer and I have found it very entertaining. The songs are done in their orginal language, which makes the over performance very good."
3,"ok, baby food blender,mill","I give this product 3 out of 5 stars. It is compact, easy to use. However, when assembling don't twist the lid to the bowl to secure. The reason why I give it 3 out of 5 stars..my lid became stuck to the bowl..you'll see why. This product is pretty expensive just to mix and chop baby food. I may return this product if anymore problems arise."
1,"Not heavy duty, buy something else","This one is so much easier than the manual food mill by kidco. I like it first. It's simple and gets the job done.Until one day I was making a whole batch of food and a slightly bigger chunk of steamed apple got caught between the blades. After a few seconds trying, I smelled something definitely toxic like burned plastic from the motor.I threw it out immediately.I later found an old hand blender with chopper actually does a much better job. Something like this:http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-CSB-77-Blender-Chopper-Attachments/dp/B0006G3JRO/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1286334562&sr;=1-2I also realized that you only puree food for baby for a very short period of time. It's such a waste of money to buy an extra appliance only for that. Just buy a regular kitchen appliance and you can use it for many other things afterwards."
2,Lesson Learned,"I am sure this item would be handy for some, but I found my regular blender to be more user friendly. You have to stand there and hold the button top down to make it go. Not time efficient for those who have more than one thing going on in the kitchen."
2,Not as good as I expected,I initially had a dex food mill which was just perfect. It prepared the baby food in just seconds and made a smooth paste as my baby liked it. However accidently it broke and I had to purchase a new one. Thats when I thought will try something new and got this kidco food mill. But to my disappointment its not working as expected. The motor goes on as soon as I connect it to the power supply ( even before I press it down as per the instructions ). Also the food is not mashed completely and my baby is not enjoying it.
3,Just okay,The motor just died on this product. It's okay and did the job for the most part. I wish I invested in a larger food processor instead. Good Luck!
2,Poor Design,"While it has the motor power and a good size cup to hold the food, it has some really frustrating design flaws. As I type this, I can't open the top to remove the food that I just blended! The lid frequnetly gets stuck onto the cup. And, the motor fits onto the base by this tiny little button that you have to perfectly align to get the thing to work. Soooo annoying!"
1,Not a food mill,"Despite this being called a food mill, it is not. It's simply a blender. In case that matters to you."
1,DO NOT BUY-TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I bought this for my daughters birthday and when she tried it out it worked once and then quit. When I requested help from Kidco I got the response, sorry it's been over thirty days. I am a very unhappy customer and will NOT order from them again!!!"
2,Does not grind fine enough for a 6 month old,My wife used it once and we are returning it. Our 6 month old chokes when we fed her apple made with it.
3,"not a mill, a chopper","This is not a food mill, it is more like a cheap/clunky version of a mini-cuisinart. It will not puree (especially not smaller amounts) so it has not been useful for baby food... yet. I'll be able to use it when my baby graduates from purees to finely chopped foods. But frankly I'd prefer to have a good mini-cuisinart for that job and Lowe's sells them for less than 40$. So, all told, a waste of money for me, though it may work fine for those who want things chopped."
2,Buy a food processor instead,"I was given this as a gift at my baby shower before my daughter was born. Now 5 months later she just is starting to eat solid foods, so I used it for the first time. First off I agree with the other reviewer, the lid gets stuck easily. Very annoying! Second, the motor turns on as soon as it is plugged in and the only control you have is to 'turbo' speed. 'Turbo' is a nice feature as it helps get all of the food pureed, but I wish the motor didn't turn on until I pressed the button. Having to unplug the unit to turn it off is just annoying especially if you have a baby in your arms.It was a gift so I'm using it for now, but I really wish I had just a plain old food processor."
5,Greet product,I love this little food mill! It is just what I was looking for. Great for making baby food and more!
3,Great,The food mill is easy storage and takes less space. The only thing is that the lid sometimes gets stuck and you have to prop it with a knife
2,"Too small, not in good condition on arrival","Firstly Amazon sent me what seems to be aused productAside from that, there really are no controls on this. Just one button. So you can really change speeds to vary the consistency very much. Also I realized that for making batches of baby food, its better to use a full size blender that makes a batch that can last a week or more. This thing is tiny!"
4,very handy item,we bought this few months ago and it is working perfect.it purees just to the right consistency for the baby.
3,Good for baby food but a little quirky!,"I like the product and find it useful, but it has a few strange quirks. Like the lid doesn't fix on and you have to hold it there with your hand to start the motor. A bit weird! It is also very loud when switched on!"
5,I absolutely love this food mill!,"I absolutely love, love, LOVE this baby food mill. When I first ordered it, I didn't even research any others and it was just a really quick buy, but, I am so glad I have it. First of all, it is BPA free. It makes enough fresh baby food for probably 4 servings, so that I can serve my baby the fresh food for the current meal and then freeze 3 containers as well. It isn't very loud when in use, it is easy to clean, it is small enough to just leave out on the counter, and it grinds everything I've put into it so far (pasta, veggies, fruit). I haven't tried chicken yet but I'm sure it will work just fine. It is one of the mills that Dr. Sears recommends too. I hope this helps!"
1,DEFECTIVE,"I placed this order while working overseas. Due to having to travel on a regular basis in a hostile environment I am now just able to try and use this product. I had a colleague receive my mail so it would not be returned. This product has just been opened for the first time 16-Apr-11. It does not work, there is a piece missing that holds the blade in place. I am past my return date, nor is it an option any more to contact the seller. I GUESS I MUST INCUR THIS COST, EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED"
2,not what i thought it would be,"I ordered this because I wanted to start making my 5 month old homemade rather than store bought foods. It doesn't make any food thin enough for him to eat. Everything that I tried to puree including carrots, peas, bananas etc, came chunky. Not only that but it also took forever for everything to process. There is no automatic button like a blender has either. So if you want to make something really really thin, you have to stand there and hold the button for like 5 minutes. On top of that the motor is in the top of the machine where the button is so if you have it running for like 5 minutes it gets really hot. Hot to the point where you cannot even hold onto it. I returned this item and found that although it is every deep, my normal blender did a much better job of making puree foods."
4,Handy tool!,"It can only handle small portions at a time, not for making huge amounts of baby food to store, but wonderful for making up a small batch for a couple of days. Purees the baby food very quickly. Of course, I have only used soft and cooked foods in it so far. It is a bit noisy, but what food processor isn't. The assembly is quick, once you get the lid on the container and plug in the unit, just touch and go."
1,"Overheat and die in 2 months, poor quality","Blade became dull within a month. took too long to puree baby food. Took about 5 minutes to puree steam chicken and carrots first months and then takes 7 minutes and then overheat and stop working for good within 2 months of purchase. Now, I just use the regular blender where I don't have to stand there to hold the on button the whole time. What a waste of time and money. I regret buying this piece of junk. I give one star for easy to clean."
1,Not really what I wanted...,"Ok, this book has some interesting small tidbits of folklore and such here and there. I haven't even read the whole thing yet because the authors tone in some parts just puts me off. This book from what I have read so far seems more to be about women's politics and thinly veiled male bashing rather then really having the ability to connect a reader to the Goddess in any tangible way. (This part is not ment to offend), but what is up with all the references to lesbianism? How does that fit into Wicca as a religious practice? And why does it even need to be mentioned at all in this book? = Aka the Dianic Great Rite? I'm no prude about anyones sexual preferences, to each there own, but in this book it just seems to throw you away from the ultimate purpose of becoming closer to the feminine divine. But your mileage may vary. I must add that I am astounded that this book has gotten so many good reviews. It just seems lacking in spiritual depth."
4,"Very informative, but needs some tweaking","I really enjoy the work of Z. Budapest, and this is a must-have reference for the pagan library.However, the information is presented in a very disorganized way, and much of it is repeated several times throughout the book. It needs a healthy dose of editing before its next reprinting."
3,Good but too short,"Great history and great ideas, but I'd recommend anyone get the later edition with both books in the same volume."
4,Women's Mysteries,A very good older book about women's ceremonies. Great for those who want to get in touch with themselves as a woman. Very useful guide.
2,Boring....,"The first 2-3 chapters are really good, but after that? Ugh, boring. And it doesn't read as easily as some other books do, I just couldn't get into it."
1,TOOOOOO SMALL,"Franchement, les perles sont tellement petites que les boucles sont ridicules. En plus, à voir le prix, aucun intért à les acheter."
5,"Well done, Mr. Hogwood.","I'm no musical expert. I simply seek out and purchase music that makes me happy. I love this recording! It makes me happy. I listen to it all the time. (especially while I study). Here's my humble advise to potential buyers: If you like clean, clear, and honest Bach, performed by an authentically small ""chamber"" sized ensemble on period instruments, then you will love this recording. If you prefer the larger, more puffed up versions which are unfortunately so common today, then don't buy it. If you're not sure what you like, you should give it a try. I find it wonderfully rendered and thoroughly enjoyable!"
2,"technically perfect, historically informed, but lifeless","Just to give you an idea of where I'm comming from. I really like: historacally informed recordings, authentic instruments (of the time), lack of vibrato, and crisp brisk recordings.This almost is that. It's technically perfect, it's amlost vibrato free, it has authentic instruments, but it's lifelss (Not unlike midi, very accurate but has no emotion!)A much better recording (I found) was performed by Akademie fur Alte Musik Berlin (which is also historically informed). Here it's played in a very expressive manner without sacrificing accuracy which just sucks you in."
1,Shrinks - waste of money,I washed the sheet per instructions and it shrank so much that I tore it trying to get it back on the bed.Spend the money and get quality sheets.
3,Cute presentation,"Cute little package that is reusable carry box, but the needle is useless and the collection of poylester yarn could be purchased more economically. It would be a cure present but the instruction booklet had to be supplemented to be able to figure out how to make the granny squares. We have not figured it out yet and we are adults."
3,evil,great addition to my library. glad i purchased it. worth the read. looking forward to other additions. love to collect.
2,escape and evil,The binding is in good shape but the pages are dried out and starting to yellow. It is readable but difficult tounderline. I would appreciate a more accurate description of the condition of the book.
4,Insightful and Helpful,"John Dean knows how government and politics work in Washington DC. He clearly describes how traditional conservative politics has made a healthy contribution to the growth of the United States. He also describes the administration of Bush/Cheney and how it differs from previous conservative administrations. It's scary to think how power hungry, authoratarian people manipulate a supposedly intelligent President to their own political ends. Maybe he really isn't that intelligent."
5,Conservatives without Conscience,"I ordered this product after hearing about the book in my book club. Already reading another book and planning a road trip, I decided to order the CDs. The item arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect condition. The price was a great deal. It cost more for shipping than for the CDS. It was worth it. I recommended it to a conservative friend of mine knowing she was a thinker and she changed parties. It's a sad commentary on how far some of the conservative right have gone but also on the inactivity of the left. I think John Dean has written an excellent book explaining the current political situation well and the historical perspective of how we got here."
5,Revealing,"I'm nonpartisan, but not nonpolitical. Over the years, my votes have been split pretty evenly between Democrats and Republicans. But in recent years, I've been very disappointed in the changes in the Republicans. They no longer embrace conservative values. They've become hard-right authoritarians, catering to a dwindling proportion of the American people. Dean's book gives the reader lucid insight into what has been going on, and his writing is backed up by extensive social research into the authoritarian personality.This is an important work for anyone who wants to remain politically aware."
5,Cuts through all the partisan shouting.,"An interesting study of the authoritarian mindset that has brought our country to the place it is. Explains in a very readable way, the psychology of those who lead by example and consensus ('liberals') as opposed to those who lead by force, fiat and propaganda ('neocons')."
5,"Finally, an explanation","Ever wondered why people can claim to be law-abiding, Christian, the ""good guys"", and then cut every corner in the book-- lie, misrepresent, cheat,and act all-around evil-- all in the name of patriotism and God. This book will tell you why. It answered a lot of questions for me. This author should know-- he's worked among them for many years."
3,True enough,"I almost never buy books and seldom read them cover to cover. I have no complaints about this one and have quoted it from time to time. Still, I have not finish reading it and probably won't."
5,Excellent Book,An all-around excellent book. Explains the mindset of those in power now. Highly recommended!
1,Let he who is without sin...,"Typical demagogue rhetoric. Same ol, same ol banter that we have come to expect. Doesn't anyone realize that there really are no parties these days anyway? It's just the Demicans and the Republicrats. Certainly the Conservatives of today are in no way the party that Reagan would recognize, let alone the likes of Goldwater. Sound familiar? It should and I don't take credit for it. Michael Savage has been pointing that out for years now. Don't even get me started on the Lib scene. What a travesty.At any rate...this guy...well, this guy should just go back to making sausage with his brother Jimmy."
1,The Kooks will love this book (as they clearly do),"Any time a ""Republican"" bashes his own side -- McCain, Hagel, Graham..or whoever, the liberal kooks are beside themselves with joy. I picked this book up from my local library thinking I might get a good laugh out of it. I got a few chuckles alright. This man tries to use his past association with Goldwater for legitimacy, but he sounds no different from the liberal kooks like those you encounter in the liberal blogosphere. If you want to know where he is coming from read no further than the first two pages of chapter two-- Bush is the enemy, Bush is the murderer, Bush is the torturer, Bush is the thug, Bush is the spy and Bush is the terrorist - the Uber Terrorist. That's the starting premise of the author, so now you know what lies ahead. Read the thread accompanying this review for an explanation."
3,"Preaching to the ""Choir""","Great book if you are a member of the ""choir."" If you are not a member, it is just another important work that will have no effect on America. Anyone that can say "",of course,"" or ""clearly"" about any subject as many times as Mr. Dean does has less than a little in common with the vast majority of Americans today. While Mr. Dean's commentary is very compelling, and convincing, it will be lost on 100% of the sheep(those who need it the most) from the first chapter. Perhaps someone could author a Conservatives Without Conscience for Dummies book and we would see a growth in understanding among enough people to make a difference. Until that occurs I recommend that you read and understand the book. Then, once you have accomplished that no small task, I sugget that the most practical place for it to be placed is, amongst many of the other great and insightful books of our time, on an out of reach dust filled shelf."
2,Turgid but topical,"Dean seems to have come to many correct assumptions regarding the present bent of conservatism in the United States. Unfortunately, many of the ideas are wrapped in too many digressions and attributions. The book would have made a fine long article, but lacks sufficient substance to be a keeper as a book."
5,Makes Good Points,"It's one sided, but very good. He is a Republican. His basic premise is that they have done studies on various leaders that are dominant socially and authoritarian and these people make up their own rules and are not so democratic. They use fear tactics and interpret the law to their favor."
5,Excellent,"Very timely even in 2011 given the rise of the Tea Party, people like Rand Paul and Ron Paul (who is even on record objecting to the concept of nurturing or mentoring parents for children), and the last gasp of patriarchy.The fact this was written by Dean, given his history seeing corruption in government and having the courage to testify to it, is helpful.The research Dean uses by the Manitoba professor syncs up with work done by cognitive linguists like George Lakoff, psychohistorians of war such as Alice Miller and Lloyd DeMause, feminists over the last 100 years, and, I suspect, the experience of any hard-working, relational U.S. citizen.I have people in my family like this and have not had children yet myself for fear of raising them to be dysfunctional and abusive in this way. I have spent a number of years trying to get out of that programming in the hope of preventing it in future children. May we put this authoritarianism and false entitlement to rest and never let it rise again."
4,A new old look at what it means to be conservative,"What a great work! This book really delves into the meaning of conservatism, the types of conservatism, the types of people who are conservatives, and how they think act and work. Basically what makes conservatives conservative. It pulls apart the social and economic facets examining each side. Lasty Dean makes a heavy case for so called, ""Goldwater conservatism,"" which interestingly enough is most closely associated with the libertarian ideals of today. Anyone who feels outside of today's political mainstream - thinks they're a democrat or a republican, but something doesn't quite fit - they should read this book."
4,Eye-opening book,"This book has confirmed my observations of the current Republican party, autocratic, authoritarian, pinheaded, and misguided and how the party has swung too far to the right from its roots. The current rise of the ""Tea Party"" bears out his thoughts and predictions. Mr. Dean produced a thoughtful and well-researched book that lays it out for anyone who has the courage to examine his or her political views. The book makes one think, provided one has the ability to think and as long as you are not a disciple of the mainstream talking [pin]heads on talk radio. I want to thank Mr. Dean for his courage as a former Republican leader for this book."
4,A Guide To Understanding The Power -Hungry,"First, let me state right up front that I've been a lifelong Republican. That is, until the past four years. All of the careful, reasonable, fiscally responsible aspects of the party that I've supported over the decades are now just a memory. John Dean's book makes clear what has happened and how the Republican Party I used to know has been mutated into the corrupt, mindless machine that it has become in recent years. Dean's book is an academic work, supported by extensive research. For those who are waking up to the damage caused by extremist agendas, this is an important guide to understanding the right-wing authoritarian mindset."
3,"Good, but not much to it.","The idea of the book is solid, with solid support. I don't have any issue with its content. However, it is a little more of a light read than what I was expecting. Essentially, most of the thesis is made in the first section. Most of the rest of the book consists of now outdated examples from the republican leadership. Also, a full quarter of its 240 odd pages is index, end notes, and appendices, which makes the meat of the book around 180 pages.Overall, a decent proposition for a study or long form essay, but not enough to really fill a book. Maybe if Mr. Dean had broadened his study to include authoritarianism from further back in history, it could have been flushed out a bit more."
1,Red meat for Republican-hating left-winged loons.,"Dean presents page after page of armchair sociological babble to prove that nearly all Republicans are arrogant, unthinking, morons who just live to screw the little guy. Save yourself $20, just scream ""I hate Republicans one hundred times."" You'll feel better and save $20."
1,As Usual the Neo-Fats Can't Live With the Truth,"Let's see here - a rat fink who brought down a President, and in doing so helped set the stage for the ""Killing Fields"", the abandonment of South Vietnam, the election of the hapless wee Jimmy Carter whose hypocrisy on human rights led us to betray the Shah and put in a terrorist regime that is threatening to blow up the world - well, that's what John Dean helped to give us.Thanks for nothing, Mr. Dean.Now he gives us this almost unreadable tripe and the neo-fats love it because Mr. Dean, a slime ball is a confirmed Bush and Neo-Conservative hater just like they are.So go out and buy it kiddies, and do drink your kool-aid. Me, I won't waste the money on rat finks or stooges of the Left. This reviewer laughs at them.and like his more obnoxious namesake Howie, this Dean has also flipped his cork. End of a sad but funny story.Required reading for kool-aid drinkers only."
4,A must read!,"John W. Dean whose experience in our government goes without saying has written a very strong statement about the state of our government. I have had a difficult time understanding how ""compassionate conservatives"" can come up with such mean spirited decisions and Mr. Dean has explained it so that the everyday person can understand.This is the second of three that he has written based on his experience and understanding of Republicans and Democrats as well as the workings of the US government. Many of his observations of the changes in our government over the past half century will leave you amazed.This should be required reading for all of our legislators and judges."
2,Writes about what he knows,"Mr. Dean writes about what he knows, which is the cynical, establishment Republicans, and their strategy to use poor, dumb, reactionary types that are clinging to their guns and religion. We can all see how well that turned out.The authoritarian instinct is strong in both U.S. parties, for opposite reasons. Fortunately, it is waning, and the traditional liberal instinct (liberty, limited government, etc.), is greatly on the increase in those who call themselves conservatives.Dean's book is a portrait of a time and a group of people who are fortunately NOT the strength of the conservative movement, but were the majority of who he is with.If you genuinely want to understand modern conservatism, I strongly recommendLiberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto. A much more pleasant, better researched, and well written book."
3,Vacuum Caps,These seem to do the trick. Not sure I needed the whole set but who knows. Good price and I like the color sizing.
2,"Great to see this film, but...",The quality of this DVD is incredibly poor. Looks like a direct transfer froma well worn 16mm print. Not much else to say.He Is My Brother
1,Unhappy,"When I tried to watch the movie the message ""Disc not able to play back"" came up on the screenwhat a waste of money!"
3,Nice book.,Good graphics and easy to read and search through. Comprehensive compilation of flags. Sent fast and in good condition.
3,"great book, BUT has one HUGE FLAW!","I had the chance to actually look at this book. The flags are awesome and the detailed descriptions and colors are amazing, BUT IT HAS ONE MAJOR FLAW: NOT A SINGLE COAT OF ARMS IS SHOWN! Instead, the book has a postage stamp! What's up with THAT? I assumed that even after revising Rwanda's flag and adding East Timor to it, you'd think that each country would show its coat of arms, but no. That's why this book looses 2 stars, one for the lack of the arms, and another for adding a stamp! A promising book that came just too short."
1,NOT A GREAT BOOK,I don't think this book offers much to the average RollerCoaster Tycoon user. I found it dull and vague.
1,A reiteration of the user's manuel,"This book was written by someone who doesn't seem to be a player of the game. The book was vague and offered a lot of advice that anyone who tinkers with the game will learn on thier own. The game itself is very explanitory and this guide is not helpful. The author even devotes an entire chapter to how much different things cost, item by item. Prices are clearly marked in the game. Perhaps he had a minimum length he had to reach for the book?"
3,Ignore The Naysayers,"I fully agree with hotrod4x5. This strategy guide does help you improve your rollercoaster if it's to intense for your guests. Another one is how to build better queues. The advice keeps repeating almost in every page one like you should never put food stalls near an intense ride. The rest is information you already know. This book helped hotrod4x5, it helped me, and it should help you. Go buy it!"
1,It's not worth it!,"I found this book to be worthless. I flipped through my friend's copy, and decided that I would never purchase it for myself. Everything the book says is information I already know!"
2,Land O Lakes Cappuccino Mix,"I found the Land O Lakes Cappuccino Mixes, both the vanilla and mocha, to be overly thick with an artificial geletin thicking agent. They also were not as sweet as most cappuccino mixes. The General Foods International brands were much better. I would not buy the Land O Lakes again."
1,Designed to fail,"We bought a new home and this was already installed. 8 months later, we start to experience power failure in the middle of heating something up. Soon it didn't work anymore and we had to had it serviced. A little over 4 months later, right after the warranty expired, the same problem occurred. Now it only powers on intermittently. I definitely would not buy this model line again. However, I know other people who have GE microwaves but no problem whatsoever so I'll look into other GE products."
1,DISAPPOINTED!,I have owned GE appliances and have always been extremely satisfied ... until now. This microwave quit working after 18 months; GE was no help. I would suggest another selection.
1,"even MORE junk, junk, junk","We bought our house 2 years ago, which had a JEM31SA installed. That's the model right before this one. 8 months ago the magnetron went out. Yes it is also under ""warranty"", as if GE would EVER honor a warranty.My honest, reliable appliance repairman can't install the part! I am forced to use one of their ""authorized"" repairman. And all of them in Oklahoma City are JUNK DEALERS - used appliance parts everywhere, seedy sections of town, etc. etc.No one will give me an estimate on how much it will cost to fix it until I pay them a $65 service call FIRST.GE sucks. I'll never buy ANY GE appliance. You can bet their refrigerators ARE planned-obsolence/disposable!"
3,non-stop problems,"I have had this microwave for about 3yrs and in that time have replaced the fan and magnetic tube. I was okay with that as it was covered under my warranty with the store I purchased it from within one yr of purchase, it was 6 months owned when it happened. Now anytime I call it is $95 for the call and god knows how much for the repair?? So annoying, because what other microwave will fit in the space it was designed for... :(This time new microwave, this one is a lemon~"
1,"Either wrong model, or wrong price","The model listed here (JEM31SF) has a suggested retail price of $260.....a bit less than the $1200 listed.The unit is available at a number of online retailers too, so it's not exactly rare or hard to find.The seller listing it for $1200 has either mistyped the price, or put down the wrong model #."
1,Worst product in the market. This is not for you.,"This is my first digital voice recorder(Coby CXR118 IC) and I'm deeply disappointed with it. I was expecting the recording quality of that of my camcorder. The reason I bought this is for the price and PC interface capability. This is the worst product anyone can make. The recording quality is so horrible I cannot recognize my own words after recording with microphone close to your mouth. Menu selection is poorly designed and the user manual is for COBY's Techies. DON'T EVEN CONSIDER THIS PRODUCT. It does not record voice, it records NOISE."
2,Software won't work,"I bought the CX-R188 primarily for the ability to tranfer recordings to my computer. The software did not work. I was not able to transfer files of more than a few minutes in length. I tried the software on multiple computers with no success. Other than this flaw (which was significant for me), the product seems to work OK."
3,COBY CXR188 IC Digital Voice Recorder,"I just got a new unit yesterday for my college courses. The recording time, advertised 90min/up to 4hrs, is only about 45 minutes in SP mode and 3 hrs. 50 minutes in LP. The quality in long play mode is fairly good - you can understand speech (there is a little warbling) - but unsuitable for music. The SP mode is good for music though. With the software, you can convert between SP/LP files and .wav or .mp3. There are some other nice features like being able to repeat segments of files (for lectures, learning languages?), VOX and sensitive mike settings. Along on the CD (a bonus?) are some Chinese language/English files. Might be useful toward learning Chinese - can't say - but there are quite a few files. The software works with my Windows XP. The manual is useful; although it's just basic. It looks like the unit might have come out in 1997. I think it's good for the price and my needs."
1,"Beware - cheaply built, far too hard to use","I am deeply disappointed with my Coby voice recorder. In the past I've used an Olympus model. Based on my experience with that device, the Coby just doesn't stand against the competition. This device is cheaply built. The user interface is almost unusable. The long record quality is terrible. The user manual is next to indecipherable (this from a guy who can figure out just about any device on the market without reading a manual). I'd highly recommend the least expensive Olumpus model over this device. Beware of this one."
1,awful product,"this is a complete waste of money. when i opened it, the recorder rattled, which i decided is a testament to how cheaply made it was. when not in use, the device drained battery power. i left the recorder in my bag over the weekend, and when i took it out to use on monday, the batteries were dead. after three months of use (and many, many replacement batteries) the recorder stopped working altogether. as a replacement i bought a sony recorder with mp3 playback. that is much more satisfactory. i will never purchase another coby product again."
1,Don't bother!,"I bought this thing years ago when it was $100! it's so crappy, I can't believe they still sell it. You have to be within a few feet of it to get it to record. I bought it for lectures in class, so that was aggravating. The sound quality is awful. If you're willing to go to a professional sound studio digitally to separate what you wanted from all the background noise and static, then maybe you'll like it. I could never get the computer software to work, so I couldn't upload recordings onto my computer. Not that I wanted any of them after I heard the quality. You can get a much higher quality recorder with more memory for just a little more money. Just take the time and shop around."
4,COBY CXR188 IC Digital Voice Recorder,"Recorder can record over 3 1/2 hours in long play mode(LP)- not 4 hours as advertised - and only 45 minutes+ in slow play mode(SP). Problems in voice quality cropped up after a few months: too much background noise from somewhere?! Had to stop using it to record lectures, which is what I got the unit for! I don't know why the audio files take so long to upload, even though the baud rate was set high. One of the button features does not work, the bookmark. After having the device for several months, I would not recommend it. Nice try Coby, no cigar."
4,Neglected Modernist masterwork,"This is a beautiful, witty series of interconnected stories that pre-sages John Barth and other ironic contemporaries. The characters auditioning for the novelists who will immoralize them at the Locos Cafe enchant, misbehave, and appear to fail Alfau. In an age where most prominent writers honestly believed authorship could change the world, Alfau is a refreshing antidote, suggesting that the act of writing merely troubles the writer."
3,johnny not so good,"if you like john martyn's earlier music you might be disappointed with this cd.this is john's jazz cd with scotish sax player andy sheppard & spencer cozens on keyboards &synth bass.this cd needs a few listens.john martyn's voice is rather too gravelly & sometimes unclear.some tracks seem overly long like the title track.their are some good tracks like the cool sounding hole in the rain,plus number nine with nice sax & piano.in conclusion not the best by the scot but some ok jazzy tracks.if you like is earler works like solid air or grace & danger,stick with them."
5,Separates the Wheat from the Chaff,"I've read dozens of business management books and for the most part, they are complex or give advice that can only be applied in very, very specific situations. ""Speaking from Experience"" contained tools that are applicable to virtually any size business and can be used by everyone on board. It's nice to see a book that can be USED and that will help businesses move up the line"
4,Brilliant for Beginners and the Experienced,"Overall this book gives its user an excellent beginning into the world of yoga. It provides a step by step introduction into the breathing techniques and asanas that allows the total beginner to ease him or herself into the complex world of yoga. Once you have mastered all of the basics the book also goes on to more advanced techniques and variations as well as a comprehensive look at how to live a life in the tradition of the original yogis. Specifically dealt with are diet, meditation, and the meaning behind all of the asanas, breathing techniques, and the philosophy of it all. The pictures and drawings a very helpful, as they show the full body, instead of stick figures, in addition to step-by-step instruction on how to get into (and out of) the asanas. Overall great value for money for beginning and experienced yogis alike."
5,Keep coming back,"I bought this book (in another country, in another language)6 or 7 years ago and used it to learn how to do yoga. Since then, I've kept up my practice and expanded it to many other styles and presentations of yoga, but I keep coming back to this book. It's simply the best one I've seen, and I love it."
4,Good info,I wish I still had this. Lent it to someone and never got it back. So I guess she likes it too. Maybe someday I will get a replacement copy.
4,I love this book!,"I am just a beginner at yoga and I love this book because the instructions to the different asans (poses) are clear and understandable, AND the more complicated poses are explained through drawings and photos, not just text. You don't need to keep track of all the steps in your head as you move into the pose, it's all there in a series of drawings. So if you are a very visual person, I recommend this book. This book takes you through the most basic of asans to the most complicated. It has all kinds of drawings and photos, as well as chart-like things at the end of each section with a simple outline of the pose and a picture so you can put together your own yoga session. This book also has background on Yoga and things like diet and breathing. Some of the models are so lithe they are gross looking, and some of the poses will make you say ""Holy Hell!"" to yourself, but secretly you will want to learn to do them too. A great book!"
5,STEP BY STEP YOGA INSTRUCTION GORGEOUS ILLOS,A pioneer of yoga. One of the first to come to the USA and one of the cleanest and purest method of yoga practice is expressed in this and all material from these practitioners.Highly recommended for the beginner or advanced yoga student.Simple and informative covering the many life states and ways to practice for each from kids to grandfolk.
5,Vietnam: Spirits of the Earth,"Vietnam: Spirits of the Earth, photographs by Mary Cross and text by Frances FitzGerald, a book of surpassingly beautiful images by the distinguished American photographer and a thoughtful, radiantly intelligent text by the National Book Award-winning author and historian, bringing us the news, not entirely expected in some quarters, that since the devastation of the Vietnam War years, Vietnam has shifted to a market economy that has allowed for a ""fascinating resurgence of traditional culture""; another work of surpassing beauty and ambition.Joyce Carol Oates"
4,Had me reaching for Kim all over again,"I had not read Kim since freshman year in college. Needless to say, my view of the world has expanded since then. This book really helped put Kim in perspective, not only in 19th century perspective, but today's as well. It seems that the very areas that were being fought over back then are still being fought over today, and the reader will recognize the locals from the daily evening news. Compared to many other adventure stories, Kim had some basis in fact, and this book looks for and places these factual basis into contex.My only complaint is when in some chapters the author was not able to visit or find the exact location described in the story, he seemed to spend too much time talking about his dead ends. This space could have been used to describe other places that he did find, but did not talk about.Overall, suggested reading for all those who fell in love with the book or just want to put it in perspective."
4,Readable but Flawed,"""Quest for Kim"" is an enjoyable book, particularly for those who read Kim again and again. However, there's an astonishing error on page 117, where Hopkirk discusses the Lama's stay ""at a temple belonging to the Thirthankars, or Jains. Founded by Buddha's own son, the faith of the Jains..."" The Buddha's son, Rahul, did no such thing. Jainism has no founder, but a series of 24 preceptors stretching back into time well befor the Buddha's own day. The last, Mahavira, was a contemporary of the Buddha's. It's distressing to see such an elementary error being made by an author as distinguished as Peter Hopkirk. He might as well have claimed that Judaism was founded by the son of the Christ!"
2,A Flawed Masterpiece.,"The title sounds strange and vague but that is what I feel about this novel. It is a slow but an interesting novel if an individual might just have the patience to let the story/plot build up. Its considered to be Kipling's masterpiece and I will vouch for the same opinion. The range of emotions, the characterisation, the development of plot are all technically perfect, but the novel wants genuine feeling. True, that Kipling presents a very correct picture of 'colonial' India, but the picture is presented through a glass tainted with colonialism. Though Kim's love for India is very real and genuine, its imperialistic under tones are difficult to ignore.All and all I would say it is a masterpiece albeit flawed"
2,Disappointing,"Unlike previous reviewer I got a purple one, but the enameling was bad quality and the black outline on the star was missing in places, and there was still scrap from the casting around the edges. It wasn't expensive but even so I expected better quality."
5,Purchase of Cabin Fever,"This was a pleasant experience. Not only did the book arrive promptly and in good condition, but the book is wonderful! I had not read a book by B. M. Bower before but I enjoyed this so much, I will try to find others written by her."
4,Works great but leaks,"The reason I got this was because it was the only sponge/soap dispenser that matches my white countertop. It works perfectly, however what I noticed is that the lid cannot close tightly because the white part is all ceramic. Which means if you were to flip it sideways/ upside down to pour out the water from the sponge holder, the detergent will leak out from the opening. The best way to avoid that is to make sure your sponge is dry every time you put it in the holder. Otherwise it looks great."
1,DO NOT BUY- FALLS APART!,chrome pump fell apart within two days and clear soap placed in receptacle turned green! Only a partial refund is given and buyer must pay return shipping- not worth returning! It is a shame to sell such an inferior product.
4,Soap Dispenser,There are a couple slight imperfections on the caddy. Other then that I love it! The dispenser works well and doesn't send out too much soap at one time.
2,nice design,Nice design and worked well until the soap dispenser tip fell off. I am planning on returning it and ordering a differnt style.
1,product only lasted a few weeks,"The nozzel fell off after only a few weeks. We tried to glue it back on, but it kept falling off. We finally gave up. We had a different model from the same brand, and it did the same thing."
1,doesn't last,Lasted for about two months. Then the soap started leaking out of the top and spill all over. Threw it away
3,ok,I bought this to use in my kitchen to have by the sink. It holds 2 small square sponges. I was a bit dissapointed in the fact that the nozzle is chrome and I thought it was brushed nickel. The bottom is a bit rough so I hope it doesn't scratch my granite countertop. I was reluctant to buy this because I was afraid that it might break easily. I've only had this for a few days so i cannot comment on how long it will last but so far so good.
1,Nozzles broke within a few weeks - do not buy,"I wish I'd returned them the first time the horizontal nozzles broke off, but I didn't. I pushed them back in and thought it was a fluke. Unfortunately not. Appears to be cheaply made so I'd suggest finding a better quality product."
2,Pieces fall off,Nozzle part comes off and one fell down the sink drain. They come loose and don't screw on straight and get stripped. We bought 5 for our apartment units and only 3 are still working.
1,DISAPPOINTING!,"Nice design, but inferior quality. Within a few weeks the nozzle broke off. I also ordered one without the sponge caddy for the bath, which also just broke. I originally thought it was just defective, but it's clearly of very poor quality since they've both broken in the same place. VERY DISAPPOINTING."
5,Looks and works great!,"When I ordered this, the first one I received was defective -- the metal pump appeared to be rusty. But I contacted Amazon and received a replacement the next day. The new one is in great condition, works very well, and looks good. I'm very happy with it."
5,Works great at half the cost,We ordered this filter after Rainsoft was unwilling to lower their price. It was easy to install and cost half as much as Rainsoft's. There is no difference in the taste of the water.
5,Valuable for generations,"This was a frightening book when I had to read it in my LitTheory class. Now I'm so glad I held on to it. It's in my ""desert island books "" collection along with the Bible, complete works of Shakespeare and a dictionary. It's the volume Harold Bloom probably wishes he'd put together.Don't let the vast panorama of ideas intimidate you. This tome is meant to be read a little bit at a time. It's a very ""back to basics"" experience. These ideas comprise the alchemical components of literary thought. Ideally, this is the book you return to in the course of reading whatever literature you fancy. Use it as a touchstone to help you discern, appreciate, and quite plainly, enjoy the art of literature."
4,Ctitical Theory Since Plato,"I bought this book because it's well informed on its' subject matter. I paid $1, as oppose to Amazon's price: $100!"
3,For the novice,"If you have very little experience of building in the sand, then this book is for you! The size and sturdiness of the book is great for taking on the beach with you. The projects are pretty basic, so even young children can join in on the fun.If you have ""dabbled"" in the sand before and are looking for some new inspirations, then I think this book will be a disappointment. Though there are a few good suggestions, most of what's in it I've learned from experimenting on my own.If you want a book for taking to the beach and for the entire family to have fun with, then this is the book! Otherwise, I wouldn't waste my money!! (Even tho I did!! :>)"
2,Pretty pictures but lacking content,"Seems to be just another ""Hey look what I did"" book. When a book has ""great projects"" in its title, you would expect some useful information about completing such projects. It made me think of a book on weather projects that said ""Stick your hand out of the window to see if it's raining."" Although this was not as bad as others, it was not all that useful for completing any sand castle project. There were some pretty pictures and a few good tips (that's why I gave the second star). Buy 'The S.o.B. ""take me to the beach"" Sand Castle Book' instead."
3,sandcastle book,This book was not what I expected. I thought it was just an art type book with pictures of sandcastles. Instead it gives directions on how to make different types of sandsastles. I kept it though...
4,A good old-fashioned read,"Personally, I love the old English murder mysteries that offer high tea in the afternoon, draughty mansions and enough arsenic lying around to kill off an entire ecosystem. Set in the English country side during WWII in a former nursing home that has been converted to a girls boarding school, this book offers a lot of atmosphere and intrigue. The plot is tight and clever and there are few loose ends. My only complaint is that the main characters are a bit remote. The author spends a lot of time describing them but, in a way, I didn't care about them. They just seemed to move about the story line like chess pieces. Overall, I enjoyed this book."
5,THE BEST THIN LIZZY EVER,"This is the best greatest hits cd ever put together by thin lizzy. It includes the early hits like the rocker , and whiskey in a jar. Has some great songs on it from the Black rose cd with Gary moore on guitar. the only problem I had with this cd is i can't believe they put the short version of the rocker on it, not the long version that was on the Dedication cd. You miss out on the terrific guitar solo by Eric Bell.But beggars can't be choosers. Over all this is the best of them all , so don't miss out on this one."
5,Great compilation of Thin Lizzy's best songs,"This 2 CD album contains just about every song the average Thin Lizzy fan would want. The songs are remastered so they sound better than some other Thin Lizzy compilations that I've heard. That was part of the reason I bought it. I already had some songs on it, but I wanted the better sound quality. Buy it and you won't be dissapointed."
4,Excellent for getting on the Cocoa/XCode wagon quickly,"The author employs an good teaching technique that leads step by step to understanding the workings of Cocoa and XCode. I am familiar with the Object Oriented Programming concept and that helped to understand the material covered. The hands-on exercises cover all the basics and are short and relatively easy. I also like the ""tone"" employed by the author. It's friendly, supportive and plain English.There is some miss-match between the current version of Cocoa (2.0)/XCode (3.0) and the book, especially where it concerns Interface Builder and the illustrations. But it was fairly easy to figure out. Except for some chapters, like Creating Interface Builder palettes.Overall I highly recommend this book, while I also hope that the author posts some addendum on the internet that shows the book's examples using the current version of the software."
2,Not too helpful,This book is too high-level and not descriptive enough. Could be a good intro but doesn't really help to do some real-world tasks.
5,Simply the best,This is quite simply the best Cocoa book on the market. Aaron has a clean and easy way of describing the most complex topics. I've read several others and they just can't compare.
4,Excellent tutorials,"I tried learning Cocoa on my own using online resources, but it wasn't until I followed the tutorials in this book that I felt that I really learned Cocoa. The explanations are to the point, examples are clear. The only negative thing I can say about the 2nd edition of the book is that it was written before XCode 3.0, so some of the steps are different from XCode 2.0.If you're using XCode 2.0, get this edition, otherwise wait till 3rd edition comes out."
4,"A good, if old, Cocoa intro","I purchased this book after 'Programming in Objective-C' by Stephen Kochan. That book did a very good job of introducing the Obj-C language. This book did a much better job of showing how to create an application using the Cocoa framework. My biggest issue with this book is that it is old. It was written after Panther came out, so there are numerous technologies that have been developed since then (such as Core Data and Obj-C 2.0) that are present in Tiger and Leopard. Besides its age, however, I thought that it was a very helpful introduction that did not require a large amount of previous experience. Moreover, I don't know of any book that does a good job of incorporating Leopard's (and before that, Tiger's) technologies, so I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn the Cocoa framework."
4,A must-have for Cocoa Beginners,Prereqs:* a solid understanding of Object-Oriented programming* Good understanding of C syntaxThis book definitely gives you the prerequisite Cocoa knowledge to start writing your own applications. I have found it invaluable for writing my first Cocoa app...
3,Finest Messiah Recording?? - I think not!,"Granted, the soloists ae impeccable (DT particularly), and I have great respect for Hogwood and the AAM, but I feel that the choir are lacking and tempi a little skewed in places (ie the choir lets this version down, and they have a very important role in this work!) For a truly uplifting Messiah recording, try Trevor Pinnock's version with The English Concert and Choir - also with fantastic soloists Arleen Auger, Anne Sophie Von Otter, Michael Chance, Howard Crook, and John Tomlinson - virtually faultless. Transporting! Peerless."
2,The most boring music ever written.,"At two and a half hours, this has got to be one of the most boring pieces of music ever written. It doesn't matter how talented the singers, how good the orchestra, how brilliant the conductor, the music is dreary. Perhaps an album of best-bits is the answer, although after listening to the thing in its entirety, I would be hard pressed to pick 20 minutes worth selecting. By the time I got to the Hallelujah chorus, I was so jaded by Handel that my spirits failed to lift. This may have been because it was this one song that made me buy the whole thing, and so I had cause to resent it. My mistake, I blame no-one. Alexander Pope was called unmusical because he didn't appreciate Handel's Messiah. I'm with Pope. The problem lies with the music"
5,Stunning!,"This disc was first released many years ago, and I purchased it soon after buying my first compact disc player. The performance and sound is absolutely stunning. I have several discs that contain both orchestra and choir, and often the combination of forces can sound overwhelming and muddied. Not here! The clarity of sound is remarkable, particularly when it does not sacrifice warm ambience. Indeed, one can here the echoes of sound at the conclusion of a piece, but such reverberation never interferes with the performance. Particular mention goes to Emma Kikby, whose voice is as pure, sweet, and strong, as any I have heard. Handel's Messiah was perhaps about the fifth disc I ever bought. Three hundered disks later, it remains my favorite."
5,Excellent,Excellent. Instruments and Vocals are superior to the other versions of Messiah that I own. This is the best version I have found and pretty much the only version I've listened to since obtaining it. Well worth $30.
5,Don't Read This Review!,"If you've listened to the clips of this recording, then hearing me yak on the subject is the last thing you should be doing. Waste not your precious time reading and order it now. On the other hand, if you haven't heard the clips, do so now, and after you're convinced (trust me, you will be), order the recording and prepare to spend the rest of your life enjoying it profusely.ONE SUGGESTION: If you are getting up there in years, lay off the Krispy Kreme, hit the treadmill, add more years to your life, and then spend them listening to Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music do more than justice (far more) to this godsend from the composer that Beethoven referred to as ""(Handel is) the greatest composer that ever lived. I would uncover my head and kneel down at his tomb!""'Nuff said. Enjoy!"
2,Too Small!,"These plugs were about 2 hundredths of an inch smaller than the 1/2"" advertised. Doesn't seem like much but it meant they would not stay in place and level in the vertical post I was fixing."
3,Small disappointment.,"I admit it, it was a bit of an impulse buy because of the art. And the art certainly is beautiful, and the sex is pretty hot. Sadly, we come up short on plot.The book has three stories, all of them two chapters long. In the first, a ninja and his master start getting it on as part of training, and the ninja realizes he loves his master. Then the master says, I love you too! And we have a happy ending. (The schoolboy story wasn't bad, at least.) Second story: Ninja 1 tells Ninja 2 he loves him. Eventually Ninja 2 admits he reciprocates the feeling and they get it on. Third story... Okay, you get the picture. Usually the second chapter is just an excuse to draw a lengthy sex scene. Hey, that's great; that alone will pique many a girl's interest. I just wish these guys boinking each other meant more to me as characters."
3,If you're a Matsumoto Temari fan or . . .,"if you like shota-esque work, then you might want to pick this one up. Otherwise, save your money for some of the other fine books already on the market. The main problems are that the stories border on PWP--any plotting that does exist is wholly conventional--and the interior art is pleasing only if you like the skinny, spidery look. The book is redeemed somewhat by the mangaka's sense of humor--the ninja master has a schoolboy fetish, the snow spirit eats ice cream to stay cool in the summer--and by the sweetness of the characters."
3,kinda creepy but nice,"I like Matsumoto Temari's works, but I have to admit I always get creeped out by her characters... and this story looked suspiciously like a shota, which I have come to reject. For people who like men with long white hair, here's your chance... one of the oneshots here has it! I particularly liked the other ninja couple...Not much plot in these stories, but there are some cute moments."
3,Just Couldn't Get Into It,"Like others who have given this book a less than a stellar rating, I also wasn't taken with The Waterlord. I'll admit that the premise was a different one, but I struggled to get through the story. Tne romance aspect hit you like a Mack truck in that the characters were almost immediately in love with one another, and therefore it was terribly unbelievable. The dialogue was tough to get through as were the descriptive scenes. Perhaps Ms. Thompson was trying to give the reader a feel for the time period, but there were too many flowery words in complex form that forced me to re-read passages more than once to figure out what was going on, and to be honest, I rolled my eyes constantly at the dialogue. I'm not giving up on this author as I see she has quite a following, so I will embark on her other titles in hopes that I will be more entertained."
2,ehhh weak characters.,"This book got such good reviews i was somewhat let down. I just couldn't get into the characters at all. There also wasn't much of a love story or it was like they looked at each other and BAM! they were in love and we're just supposed to accept that. I will give some of her other books a try in the future perhaps I just didn't like her historical books, oh well..."
2,Oh well....,"I wonder, did we all read the same book??? After those glorious reviews of this book I purchased the book and wished I hadn't. The romance is all of a sudden there, don't know why the characters fell in love. There was also not enough characterization for my taste, I still don't know who the hero/heroine really were and they seemed very one-dimensional."
5,turquoise chip bracelet,"Cute Stretchy Blue Howlite Turquoise Chip Braceleti bought four of these as stocking stuffers. i cant believe the low price, with quality. $4.95 which included shipping for all four. HSBTR"
4,fairly strong fishnets,"These are fairly strong. That is, they hold up well, and don't fall apart the first or second time you wear them. I did manage to get a small rip in a spot on the thigh when the fishnet caught on someone's dress, but this hole hasn't gotten bigger since then, which is a good sign of quality."
4,Fun and useful!,I read the reviews and ordered the ring as small as possible to minimize the pain. I'm a full time bartender and I really like it. It does start to hurt after I open 20+ bottles but that's mostly because just like with any bottle opener some bottle caps pop right off and some are more stubborn and that's when it digs. I had to stick with it to get the hang of but it's so handy (haha)! My customers think it's a nifty trick and it's a conversation piece behind the bar. At home and at parties my boyfriend loves handing his Heineken over to me to open. It's very durable too.
1,It broke,I bought this for my husband and it broke after only a few uses. Even though it was such a great price it is really disappointing.
3,Fisrt one broke trying to open the third bottle,"The first ring I received cracked trying to open the third bottle. I contacted the seller and very nicely they sent another. A week later I had a brand new ring which works great. Three stars, only because it was very disapointing that the first ring, which was a gift, cracked so soon."
2,"Great Product, not great quality metal","I bought this after seeing it in use on the food network. Seemed like a fun and handy ring for a beer drinker such as myself. I got it home and tried it out, and it works just fine. I had no pain when opening a bottle. My thought was that I should just wear it because you never know when you may need to open a bottle of beer. So I just left the ring on and went to bed. I woke up the next morning and my figer turned greenish brown.I will continue to use the ring when I can remember to put it on before I go out, but it would be nice to be able to just leave it on. Stainless is not supposed to turn your fingers colors so I suspect it is either a very log grade stainless or not stainless at all."
3,Cool idea...,"this is an AWESOME idea, lots of fun if you drink a lot of bottled beverages. be wary of sizing correctly, if it's too big it will leave a huge dent in your ""social finger"". i used the sizing info in the description and it wasn't exactly scientific, so the ring was at least a half size too big. other than that, pretty cool gadget!"
5,Ring Thing Bottle Opener,"I bought this ring in 2007 and still have it today!! Although it doesn't get heavy daily use, it has faithfully been used for 5 years and never failed. Highly recommended."
1,it doesnt work!,I currently recieved three of the ring thing bottle openers. When you put them on and try to open a bottle all that happens is.... on the top side of your hand the ring thing digs into your skin from the pressure underneath causing pain and a small dent on your hand. I would not recommend this product to anyone. but if you have any other products that do work i would love to hear about them.
3,"Cute gift, slightly confuse instruction","My 9 yrs old niece like this gift, for the dog. The instruction is not easy and clear to follow. Maybe easy for those whose have good knowledge of crocheting. My niece is a beginner (straight line crochet) I am not much better. But the dog is cute though!"
5,Played on instruments made at the time the music was written,"One of the best recordings made of the Brandenburg Concerti. The AAM plays instruments as old as the music, but they sound better than any of today's instruments. -TLG"
3,Ho Hum,"As Brandenburg Concertos go, it seems like you've heard it once, you've heard it before. Hogwood breaks no new ground with this recording except in varying some of the more ""traditional"" movements of the Concertos.Technically, Hogwood and the Academy are as proficient and musically adept as ever. The sonic quality and enthusiasm is evident in every movement of every concerto, which is why I selected this set over others. Hard to pass on because of other recordings Hogwood's done (I especially like some of the Bach harpsichord concertos he's done). My next selection would have been Trevor Pinnock's, based on his previous recordings.I have found that certain artists have a gift for creating reliable (but not predictable) recordings that are worthy of purchase. This is not the case with this CD set, however, as it was not as good as I had expected. Not that it is bad - it's just not <great>, which is what I have come to expect over the years from Hogwood and company."
4,convenient,was considering the canon psc-50 case for my s400 but thought this was better. the smaller zippered pouch can hold a couple spare batteries and memory cards where the psc-50 can't. looks well made and is better than some other brands with velcro and/or snap buckles.
2,Sent the wrong one,Just received mine and noticed that the company sent me the wrong SKU; as I did not know Rothco has two models. Model listed here is 8537 and I received 4537 which is the lightweight version. Too bad I washed it before noticing. Check the package before you open.
2,"Nice Shemagh, bad color","I am acquainted with many types of sand, i.e. desert sand, beach sand, vag sand etc., however I have yet to see any sand the color of this ""Desert Sand"" shemagh. For what is advertised as a ""tactical desert scarf"" it looks more like something an old lady would wrap over her hair on a walk to the park after church. I would describe the color as a rather fruity yellow. In other respects this shemagh is of decent quality, and performs as expected, which is why I rated it two stars instead of one, even though I will never use it."
4,One of my new favorite things ...,"I'd heard a lot about how multi-purpose Shemaghs are but didn't really ""get it"" until I bought one. I've had mine for about 2 weeks, I wear it daily and I think I've found about 20 uses for it in my every day life. Good product."
4,Pretty Neat.,"Well I like in OD green, it looks and feels nice. Its just a scarf, no defects for this one (y)"
5,WAY nicer than expected!!!!!,"Its a great size shemagh that has a quality feel and finish. Dont buy the generic dirt cheap ones when for a few bucks more this can be had. The print is nice, the pics dont do it justice. Im very happy"
4,good,This came fast a is warm. Print was nice and weave was alright not the best but worth what i paid.
4,Great,"Soft, warm, durable. Just what I expected to get out of this, especially considering the price point. Met all of my expectations."
4,nice shemagh,"Good, tough material. Not see-thru like a lot of the fashion-oriented models seem to be. If you want one, this is it."
4,Desert Tan was more yellow,"So I now have several pairs of yellow underwear (haha).Good size, and materials. Was looking for something more subdued so washed several times to fade it, but otherwise, all fine."
2,It's ok,Like the pattern and the black and green color. The craftsmanship is a little on the poor side nReceived with quite a few snags in the material.
2,It's a shemagh bit not a great one,Having been to the Middle East and purchased shemaghs on the streets for $1 this one is overpriced. I wouldn't pay more than $5 for it in the states. It is difficult to find them state side but that doesn't mean you should sell an inferior product. It's relatively thin and the weave isn't very tight.My shemagh was yellow not close to the tan color I was expecting. The quality of the product was okay and it was shipped expeditiously but I was really disappointed in the color. In case you couldn't tell.
2,If you're bored and like tying tiny knots...,"...then this is the shemagh for you. When I got this thing, there were already a few places that were unraveling. One was extremely bad, and took quite awhile to fix without further damaging the shemagh. Basically I tied a tiny knot to stop the unraveling in each spot, which was slightly time-consuming. After tying off all of the unraveled spots, I removed the tag and washed it. After being washed and dried, the fabric turned out to be noticeably thicker and softer than when it came in the mail, though not nearly as thick and soft as my shemagh from Best Glide ASE. If not for the unraveling, this would have gotten four stars from me, but just barely. It can be used, but why not pay a couple of bucks more for one that you don't have to spend half an hour mending?"
4,Scarf,My gf used this & I used the yellow & black one at Burning Man and they worked great. Kept out the dust protected the head during the burn from ash.
2,One Big Issue,"Product is well made, looks good, but is too small to tie properly. I'm very disappointed since it would have been a great product if the measurements quoted were accurate."
2,Buyer beware: different quality from different countries,"I purchased this based on the high quality reviews here, and I assumed I was buying a high quality shemagh from Pakistan. What I got instead was a Rothco 8537 shemagh made in India. Without opening the package, I can tell that the stitching is loose, I already see runs, and it will not last long.I am contacting the seller to see if they have any good shemaghs in stock.So realize that the good reviews on here may not apply to the product that you receive."
5,Great,"I bought this shemagh for the sole purpose of keeping my neck warm, and it does just that. On the coldest of days, I barely feel anything from the cold winds because of the shemagh. I have yet to try it out in the heat of the day as I read that this can keep you warm during cold temperatures and cool during hot temperatures. I chose the olive drab one because it was the least conspicuous of the colors; I know people use these for fashion and whatnot and I only bought it for practical purposes. It doesn't tear or rip after you throw it in the wash and the color doesn't seem to fade. The material is pretty thick and durable, so over all good deal, good find, good price."
2,Arrived with hole,"So the only reason I'm not giving this 1 star is because this scarf is so cheap, I ""knew"" what I was getting. I did NOT expect, however, to receive a product with a large hole in it (about the size of a quarter)! Upon trying to return it, the seller Private Island didn't offer to pay any shipping for an exchange, so I just kept the thing. It is already coming apart, and I fully expect it to be useless after one or two uses. If you're looking for durable, I would look elsewhere. If you're looking for super lightweight (almost transparent), this just might be what you want."
1,BEWARE!,"I purchased this shemagh because after serving in the military it became sort of a must have, so many uses for it...from warming you up, to keeping sand out of your face.I have several but I gave my OD shemagh to a family member.Due to recent events I'm re-deploying so I ordered the OD shemagh from this vendor and received an dirty, damaged unusable rag.I will be posting a youtube video soon showing the conditions of this item.For now buyer beware is all I can say to all of you.I will post a link to the video when it's uploaded."
5,Shemagh from Captain Daves,"I got this shemagh about a year ago. It is about 42""x42"" and has held up very well with a lot of use. I am writtin g this review because I am about to order another one from the same seller. I would recommend this product."
5,"shemagh tactical scarf, desert scarf","First time use was April 23rd and 24th, 2011 playing golf at Colbert Hills. Typical spring day; very windy (10 to 15 mph with 30 mph gusting), cloudy, low 40s degree F, wind chill low 30sworked great keeping my face and neck protected, did not notice it even when putting, light but able to keep wind off and it looks good too, had to take it off when the sun broke through but when cloudy it was easy to wrap up again.love the scarf and recomend it to anyone for those cold days in the outdoorsOLIVE DRAB (GREEN/BLACK) SHEMAGH TACTICAL SCARF 8537OLIVEDRAB"
1,Deception,"Do not buy the ""Sand"" color if you think it will look like the picture with a contrasting black. The advertizing here is an intentional deception - no-one in their right mind would buy the ""Sand"". US Cavalry is plainly unloading their stock through deceipt. I would give zero stars if I could. US Cavalry did not respond to my private review earlier and merely pulled their smemaghs for a few days to void the earlier review."
2,Not worth buying,"for the price your paying here, go find a better product. got mine in the mail the next day, but was not impressed. not only is this by all means a lightweight product, but its also poorly constructed (made in india). mine was partially come unraveled -- fresh out of the package! but if truth be told, this piece of crap is a step up from what I had before, so that's the only reason it doesn't get one star."
3,Scarfy,"This is a good product. However, I ordered the ""Desert Sand"" color scheme and when I got it, it's clearly yellow, not a sand/tan color. Other than that, very light and easy to manipulate."
3,Not bad,"Good quality product with alot of available colors, however I found the 42""x42"" size too small and did not have enough slack left over to make a good tie. This should have been 44""x44"", but maybe women or children will find it useful."
4,What a life saver.,"Used my Shemagh on a recent cold and blustery trip to San Francisco, kept my head woarm and the cold wind off of my ears the whole day of sightseeing along the Pacific shorline. Four stars."
4,Impressed,"Initial impression:Here is my initial impression on this product. It is very big once you have unfolded it. I did not see any defects with the material such as loose string, holes in it ect...I tried it on and material was very light yet it felt that it would keep my face warm from the cold weather.There are several Youtube clips on how to wear it so I will have to look into that...I will give an update on the products once I had a chance to wear it while out in the cold weather."
4,great,"I can hide from deer, hide from the cold, wipe my nose, protect myself from scratchy branches, fold it up and make a dry place to sit, and sport the latest tacticool fashion (the item is both tactical and tacticool). I will probably get another one in a color that matches my socks."
1,Enemy Target Practice!,This thing could get you killed! If you were to wear this over there you may be taken for the bad guys. Not funny! Don't wear it! My buddies over there saw this and got a real giggle out of it!
5,"Great product, low price",I love the Rothco shemags. they are less expensive than others I have seen and are a much higher quality.
2,out of time,"My wife bought this book because I want something to read. She did not realize is was a series. The book is based in 1999 and it was written in 1983.The story is about the future from a 1983 point a view. As we all know its 2009 and the future did not turn out about way Mr.Johnstone wrote about,so you should take it with a grain of salt.The main characters keep youre intrested. The book is very conservitist,like the early eighties. Over all its not bad read for not reading the first book."
2,A Waste of Time and Money,"I've read the first three books of this series and am giving up on the last one.Constant repetition-whole sections word for word from earlier books in the series as supposed ""flash backs"" (lazy writing) and lots of sadomasochistic, graphic sex scenes. I ended up not really caring what happened to the major characters. I recommend you don't waste your money on this trash."
1,Incompatible with Lion,"""The product is NOT compatible with Lion OS. The seller (Rover Mail) was not aware of the incompatibility when it was sold."
2,"No performance, no service","I'm giving it one star based on the problem and response outlined below; the second star is because I think it would have been a good game had it worked for me.I tried loading this game twice, and both times on startup I got a blank screen, with the only escape being to manually shut down the computer. I emailed the company, which is in England, and they wrote back saying that they've noticed this is sometimes a problem. . . . ?????? They said I'd be contacted within the month by someone who would try to work it out with me, but I was never contacted. I consider this a pretty poor response to a problem that occurs frequently enough for the manufacturer to notice. A kindly retailer allowed me to return the game for exchange, but I'm pretty sure I'll never try another Feral Interactive product."
1,Fable: The Lost Game,Game crashes. Downloaded and installed updated version. That crashes just the same as the older version. Cannot play at all. Will see if tech support responds.
4,Zheeeeeeeeeeeem Likes Hogwood,"A lively Vivaldi interpretation. Not as bold and flamboyant a style as Il Guardino Armonico, but not dreadfully stifled like other british interpretations. The only downside to this CD is the hash from it's early digital recording."
1,Four Seasons,"Finding classical music is not difficult, however finding a great interpretation is always the most challenging and rewarding labor. Christopher Hogwood's rendering of this Vivaldi jewel is truly a wonder to behold. The masterful direction leads you through a year of seasons as Antonio Vivaldi lived it. Bright and delicate in spring, thoughtful and relaxed in Summer, focused and fruitful in Fall, and accepting and longing again for the coming year in Winter. Journey through a year of Four Seasons with Vivaldi in this refreshing delight you will enjoy again and again."
1,Yawn---,"Well,I finally got around to reading Weeks' book. I was the toughest guy in Boston but probably the most intelligent,fair and honest of all of Whiteys'puppets,sez Kevin.Probably a little truth with a lot of little half truths and action and adventure thrown in.I hope that this is the last of the Whitey Bulger books.Apparently, everyone from Southie is going to write a book. Maybe,we'll soon be getting a Kevin Weeks action figure.Out of all of them,'Black Mass' by Lehr and O'Neil, and 'Rat Bastards' by Red Shea are probably the best. Shea probably summed it up when he gives Kevin the nickname ""Two Weeks""; because that's how long it took Kev to flip. I'm surprised it took that long.But that's to be expected these days. It used to be ""do the crime-do the time"". Not any more. Now it's ""get busted-rat out all your friends-get your book deal"". Sure,Shea also wrote his own book,but he did the time; when it would have been easy to flip. Between Red and Kev; I'll stand with Shea anytime."
2,Not so Fast!,"What is it nowadays that criminals like Kevin Weeks gets to write and publish books for the masses. Whitey Bulger is still loose and people like Kevin Weeks probably know where he is. I don't have much sympathy for Weeks. He hates Howie Carr probably because he reports the truth as he knows it to be. Anyway I read Howie's book which I recommend. I thought New Jersey had too many criminals mingled in politics. I was wrong because Massachusetts had the Bulger Brothers. Regardless of how different they are, both brothers abused their power for themselves. One, Whitey, far more than his brother in politics who also got away with crimes but I don't think murder. Anyway I am giving it two stars."
3,"Less Truthful About the ""Real"" Whitey than Eddie Mac","I'm an Irish-Catholic guy in his 40's who grew up in Boston in the late 60's and 70's. I've read Streeet Soldier and Brutal several times each, and I personally believe much more of what Eddie Mac has to say about the ""real"" Whitey, as opposed to the relatively reverant tone in which Weeks still speaks of Whitey. Sure, Eddie Mac and Weeks are both equally dangerous sociopaths, and will surely go to Hell (assuming it exists) for all the evil they inflicted on their fellow human beings over the years. Having said that, Weeks still seems to be loyal to Whitey, and probably knows exactly where he is hiding out these days. For that reason, I don't believe a word he says when he defends Whitey against allegations that he was a rapist, a child molester, etc. Eddie Mac definitely gives the reader more insight into what Whitey was really like...and isn't that why we all read these books, anyway?"
1,Not very good,I think all the good stuff would have put Weeks into jail again. I see this book as a cheap attempt at fast $$ over the graves of Debra Davis and the likes. I would have like to have seen some of the things he knows but didn't tell. It was pretty boring.
1,Trash,"Please, no more Southie gangster books. This guy is a coward who stood by while women were killed. Save the money and donate to a battered women's shelter. It's not even well written. Who wants to read tough-guy bragging about beatings and shake downs. You have to wonder how a bum like this scared any one. And why did he leave out the part about being Whitey's boy toy? Everyone in Southie knew this. And that's a story that might have been interesting: the repressed gay subtext of the Southie underworld."
2,"Kevin,Don't give up your day job",Mundane and boring approach to what must have been exciting stories. Better descrition and less duplication would have made a better read.
4,Better than the other inside accounts,"After reading the ""soldiers"" account of what happened by both Red Shea and Eddie Mac (Who never mentions Red ,by the way) I knew Weeks book would be more of the same but at least Weeks was a main figure in Whitey's world. You gotta think that Red and Eddie Mac saw themselves as far more important than they really were. You really don't come away from this book having any respect for Weeks, but you can be sure that his stories are probably more factual because he actually spent time with Jim."
3,Very interesting,"Love true stories of any sort, especially crime stories. Interesting to see how the tables turn. Verizon interesting in deed."
3,Fairy tale,"I'm sorry ,but reading this book was like reading a fairy tail.Kevin not only followed in his mentor footsteps and became a rat ,but told the biggest fantasy story in the past 100yrsYou don't work your way up the ladder of an organization like Whitey's with out paying your dues.How convenient that Kevin was never involved in any of the murders ,only the clean up and disposal.His hands were dirty , plain and simple ,but to get the plea bargain he received he had to lie through his teeth to the feds ,and has told the story so many times , he now believes it.I have read every book written about Whitey and the South Boston rat pack , and this one is by far the biggest fabrication since Snow White."
1,pure garbage,I have finished with a third of this book. Kevin states he bought the liquor store in southie with flemmi and bulger. the fact of the matter is they took it. either sell it for a nominal fee or die. that tells you what that bum is made of. I have read most of the other books having to do with the whole sordid affair and this by far is the worst. save your money . I would be ashamed to call this bum my father. I would even change my name
3,A henchman's perspective,"Weeks is one of several associates of Boston gangster Whitey Bulger to write a book and tell tales. (Obviously the Irish don't subscribe to the Mafia's vow of omerta.) He gives us a glimpse into the day-to-day life of a major organized crime figure, but his insights are limited to what he saw on the ground. While his stories are often colorful, Weeks doesn't get into the qualities that made Bulger unique. Bulger and his partner Stevie Flemmi were unlike any other crime bosses in American organized crime, running the Boston rackets like chess masters, always positioning themselves for maximum profits. BRUTAL is a snapshot into Bulger-Flemmi world, but the definitive book on that deadly partnership has yet to be written."
4,Some facts,"Like Howie Carr, a lot of you have the facts mixed up. Unlike Carr, you do not have a fact checker to help you out, so I'll offer my services.Although I do not wish to comment on how I feel about the book, I would like to note that people are making allegations and statements that are simply untrue. For all of those people who refuse to buy the book because they believe it puts money in Weeks's pocket--it does not. As a result of a civil suit, the rights to Weeks's story was given to the victims' families and thus, they receive the money from the book.Also, one man states that Jimmy strangled two women, but it was, in fact, Stevie Flemmi that murdered his step-daughter and girlfriend. So, if you are going to comment, which is your right, at least get your facts straight."
5,"Powerful, user-friendly computer with big wide screen.","Apple is quite simply the best and most innovative computer manufacturer. Their various Macintosh computers are very user-friendly: easy to set up and use and (unlike most PCs) seldom crash or malfunction. Furthermore, the new iMac computers, although full-featured, are very compact and, thus, take up little desk space. The new iMacs all have adjustable flat-panel displays with exceptionally bright, sharp images. Now Apple has increased the processor speeds of these strikingly-attractive new iMacs and reduced their prices. This model has a big 20"" wide screen display plus a 1.25 GHz G4 processor. Please don't be put off by the fact that the processor clock-speed is ""only"" 1.25 GHz. The G4 processor accomplishes more than twice as much per clock cycle as Pentium 4s do and, thus, is faster than a 2.5 GHz Pentium 4. All things considered, this new iMac is a terrific, versatile wide screen computer at a reasonable price. Highly recommended."
3,"Great monitor, weak CPU","This monitor is a work of art. The CPU is 2 years out of date. Buy a 2GHz G5 and a 20"" LCD instead. This system is too out of date."
5,THIS MAKES MY LIST OF TOP 10 ESSENTIAL GRAPHIC NOVELS,"My favorite volume of the 3 2001 nights by Yukinobu Hoshino. This series is so well executed that i find it hard to believe i'm reading a comic. This easily makes my top 10 list of essential graphic novels. The stories are amazing. Hoshino successfully creates stories filled with heart, emotion and grand scale. This volume focuses more on the alien life forms that man comes in contact with during his exploration. The second to last tale, ""Odyssey in Green"" is my favorite tale. Scary, fascinating, immense, sad and very very engaging. I'm a die hard comics fan and this ranks very high on my list of all-time favorite graphic novels. Get this series - it's the best!"
3,"A well written book, but a little outdated","The book covers most of the basics, but it is poorly illustrated and doesn't deal with any of the more modern advancements in CNC technology.Recommended- P Smid, CNC Programming Handbook"
5,Refer to this book everytime we go to Disney,"My six-year-old daughter really enjoys reading this book. We've been to Disney twice since buying this book and we've used this book to prepare our itinerary each time. My daughter particularly likes the fact that it gives you the ""heads-up"" on which rides are ""scary,"" ""dark,"" ""rough,"" etc. It's always good to know what to expect before you go.And, after our vacation, we like to read the book and relive our trip through the pages of this book. It helps to refresh our memory and keep the excitement alive."
5,Disney Bound Kid,"The book is great. Although it will be a little out of date when we take our trip Jan 2008), it has been really helpful. My daughter loves to read parts of it before bed, especially the kids reviews. It has given her more of an idea of what she would like to do, and also made her feel a little better about the ""big rides."" There are some good tips for kids, an autograph section at the back, and the book has space to mark when you've gone on the ride listed. We haven't been to Disney yet, but I know this book will go with my daughter when we do. Thanks!"
3,7 year old likes it!.,"My 7 year old daughter has never been to Disney World, but has all of the ""Princess"" dolls. I'm her dad, and I grew up with Disney.The book caught my daughters attention right away, and she wanted to read it and place stars by places that sounded fun. We are going on a trip in April. The book is colorful, easy to manage (don't expect too much detail), and is getting my daughter excited about her upcoming trip (what I wanted.) It helps parents also--my daughter enthusiastically pointed out what she wanted to see."
3,Better for Pre-Teens,This book gives good information that is not usually found in the typical Disney Guide. But it is best used for kids 12 and under...teens will be put off by the youthful lay-out of the chapters.
2,Nothing Has Changed!,Man! This is the cheapest book I have every seen! I have the 2005 edition and it is an exact copy of the 2006 edition. They only thing they changed is the photo of the front cover and the stupid games in the book. They haven't even changed the photos of the rides! I am ashamed of the people who made the book. :(
5,"Bone, Shell, Copper, And Wooden Relics of The American Indian","A comprehensive price guide of Bone, Shell, Copper and Wood relics found in the United States. Drawings of all specimens indicate approximate age and size variations, general locations in which found, and average market value. Great drawings of Native American artifacts."
5,Where do Snowballs go.......?,Snowball turns up again years after the Animal Farm debacle . Reed's bristling animal characters weave a symphony of ironies. We surrender ourselves to the unwinding economic distopia. Exciting reading.
4,Pretty Good...,"Inherit the Mob is a good book, provided that you have a solid knowledge of Mafia history. If you don't, you'll be way out of your league. I was lucky enough upon my first reading to pick up a copy that had notes written in by an insightful reader explaining the references. The second time I read it, I was well-versed in the Mafia, so I could follow it. Suggested reading before reading: The Valachi Papers, Boss of Bosses, the Godfather book. Also, watch the Godfather movies."
2,Quality issues?,I am sorely disappointed. The first safe I purchased did not work with brand new batteries. I returned the safe to the store where I purchased it to get an exchange (one hour drive each way). The second safe powered up with the new batteries but the keys that were provided did not work - they were the correct keys but the lock was broken and would not open the safe. You need to open the safe to program the fingerprints. I returned the safe for a full refund! I believe if you spend a few hundred dollars for a safe it should work the first time every time. I don't feel that this safe would be reliable enough for emergencies...
2,You pay for what you get,"I bought this off-camera flash bracket at the end of a camera equipment spending spree. I didn't have enough money left to get what I wanted, so I settled for the ProMaster. Well, it's cheap construction and flimsy quality almost made me feel embarrassed to use it in public! The little ""strap"" that goes around your hand for extra support is made of plastic. Worst of all, after only a few uses the flash mount clip broke off. It was held in by 3 tiny screws that wouldn't screw back into place because the screw holes were stripped when it broke. Save your money and buy something that will last."
4,Great ref book,Would have bought the new version but got a used for a steal. Great book nonetheless since I usually examine old units anyway. This and the Audel series & a technical foundation is well establised.
5,fast and perfect condition,i bought this book and it was in perfect condiion and shiping was fast.i am very happy with this purchase from amazon...
1,No Fun!,"I bought this for my 1 yr. old son and it doesn't work like it says! The whole shower and hand button has to be emerged in the water, before water will squirt out, and the squirt button is too hard for a child to push. Doesn't work, should have returned it. Would not recommend it!"
1,What a disappointment,"Biggest disappointment I have ever had with a product. Will not stay attached, suction cups are cheap and too small for the weight of this toy. The idea is good but the result was very poor. You have to pump and pump and pump many many times before the water comes out the shower head and it is very hard to push not suitable for a child because they don't have enough strength and that's if they don't lose interest while you sit and pump away trying to get it to start. Then once the water is in the toy and you can pump it out the shower head it doesn't hold it so if you stop pumping you have to start all over again."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Received this shower thinking it would be a nice way to have the kids having running water. However the ball that's supposed to suck up the water floats, so you have to hold that down under the water. The push button to get the water to come out, is way too hard to push, and the suctions on the toy itself barely hold the toys weight to the side of the tub. This toy is junk and it's money I'll never see again!!!!"
2,not a wise purchase,"I agree with the other reviewer that this is not the greatest toy. In addition to the end that is supposed to stay in the water but floats instead, the 2 suction cups meant to hold the toy to the bath tub or wall are too small to hold it steady, so it slips easily out of place. It is not that easy for small hands to pump and to get water coming out of the shower head you have to pump it at least 20 times to prime it before the shower starts to flow. Needless to say, by that time, the toddler is pretty much bored with pumping."
5,Hurricane Fan,"I carry two of these on the job. I am a front of house engineer, I'm the guy sitting behind all the knobs at concerts, and we work outdoors all summer usually in very hot weather. One of these fans lives under the front of house desk and the other in monitor world on stage. This fan moves more air than any fan I've used and it does so with little noise. It has handy outlets on the side for the occation when the video crew needs to charge a battery. I don't know what I'd do without one of these when it's 100 degrees out and I have to sit in one place for hours one end. The fan saves me from burning up. It has a super heavy duty cable and a three speed switch. This is a great fan if you want to concentrate air flow on one person. The up and down adjustment is also a great feature putting air flow exactly where you want it."
4,Not as useful as I thought,"This item is very well made and I'm sure will last a long time.It's smaller than I thought (my fault, I'm sure - I'm used to working with big fans of this type). For my purposes (cooling a hot garage), I found that two circulating fans worked better."
5,Yahoooooooo!!!,"Well I was in a bind. It got hot here in Los Angeles. Went to Home Depot, Lowes, Target and NO FANS ANYWHERE. I saw this little blower and took a chance and I have to say I LOVE IT. Three blower speeds and it can really push some air around the house. The pivoting function (up and down) is more handy than you would think."
2,not worth the money spent,"Air King 3-Speed Pivoting Utility Blower with Grounded Outlets #9550/9552fan did not have as much blow power as I was expecting... good fan but, a cheap box fan could do the same job."
3,Great fan ... but ....,"We bought two of these about 4 months ago to use in the bedroom. We like the noise of a fan, but we also like lots of air movement. These fans DO move the air. For that, I give the fan 5 stars!!However, over the last 2 weeks, the fans now put off an odor ... almost a chemical smell. My husband goes to bed hours before me, and shuts the bedroom door. When I go back the bedroom, there is a VERY strong chemical smell. The side vents are regularly vacuumed, so it is not a dust build up. I have no clue what it is, and I'm doing my best to find out.If the smell was more of an electrical smell, I would be concerned and quit using them. But it's not, it is more of a chemical smell. I will try and update this review if we figure out what the smell is."
2,Not very good........,"This pot is lightweight stainless steel. The bottom scorched through, (blackened) on it's first use. I used it on my stove's 16,000 BTU burner, but that has not been a problem for my other cookware. The fried chicken it produced was good, but I'm sure this pot can't stand up to heavy use. Buy it only for occasional use. If you plan to fry alot, buy a basket for your dutch oven or buy a commercial aluminum fry bottom/basket."
1,"amatuerish, vague and completely lacking in critical detail","This title of this book does not accurately reflect the content. It is extremely vague, completely lacking in any technical detail regarding crop production, expected yield per acerage used, costs involved, marketing/selling etc. I can sum this book up in one sentence ""I grew some flowers and sold them in my local shop and I dont know how or why I was successful at this practice."" This really is a worthless book...the author has a very homely style which reinforces the impression that she is a complete amateur at this business. She runs out of anything useful to say after a couple of chapters and sets off to tell the life-story of her flower-growing acquaintances without paying much notice to the technical and scientific detail of their various ventures. If you are hoping to get some serious insights into growing flowers and developing marketing strategies for selling those flowers, forget it....do not buy this book."
4,Awakens insight,"I liked the unique approach this author took. I've read a lot about eastern philosophy, and it's exciting to see someone apply it to western life. It's impossible to live exactly like a monk in America, but that doesn't mean all their teachings should be abandoned. This book helped me maintain some inner peace while inspiring my mind for my constant self-reconstruction."
3,Not all that bad - grin,"Devon and Colleen carry on a getting to know one another flirtation through their answering machines - never thought of that one! - because of their complexity and odd work schedules the answering machines, ""Ingatious"" and ""Freda?"", add just a touch of appreciated humor -- I feel that I was getting to know the quirks of these characters and could appreciate their problems with each other -- the dog was a nice touch -- not bad for this style of book -- one I call a fast read -- but as usual they end [very delicately put] up in bed."
2,2 of 4 chairs broke & table unstable within 2 years,"Two of the 4 chairs we purchased broke within 2 years of purchase. They were only used by children under 8 years old and weren't thrown across the room or jumped on by monkeys. They split apart generally starting by the drill holes.The table has never been completely stable. Didn't notice this until we installed wood floors. The table rocks back and forth. I trace this problem to the mismatch between screw lengths and screw holes mentioned by others.Could have been a lot better, they do look great and are perfect size for the under 10 set. But they just don't last."
5,Sturdy and Well-made,"I am very pleased with this table and chairs. It looks exactly like the picture, even the color. It seems very sturdy and well-made. It was easy to put together--no problems that others have mentioned. I sit on the chairs all the time with no fears that my weight will break it. I like that it's round. Great buy (and I'm pretty picky...)!"
1,Horrible quality,This is very bad quality. The chair leg broke in about 2 months of use! The table is not stable enough and the color turned out to be lot different that it appears on the website
1,"If you order this item, prepare to wait more than a month!","I ordered this item and received several notices postponing its delivery. Eventually, I cancelled my order because more than a month has gone by, and still, no table and chairs."
1,SHOULD BE PULLED! DEFECTIVE!,"The holes drilled for the screws are not large enough. You can only get them in part way, they then get stripped and won't come out either. You are then stuck after three hours with a useless pile of wood that cannot be put back in the box to return. This is the WORST experience I ever had with wood furniture. This item should be pulled off for sale."
1,This book is bad.,"The book doesn't have enough examples and materials to read. Too many stuff being covered in this small book. The book is more like for non-math majors because it's really hard to interpret the reading. Most of the problems just test your conceptual understanding by asking true and false questions, but it lacks the procedure a typical math book should have. Not a really good textbook. Well the price is cheap though."
2,hard to lock into place,"This chair is comfortable, but is extremely hard to lock into position. I cannot push the locking mechanisms under the arms without getting off the chair and flipping it on its side. The mechanisms are palstic and thus cannot even be oiled to ease their turning. This is way too inconvenient."
3,Various artists make for VARIOUS song-types!,"I bought this because of it's cheap-price and to see what ""punk"" sounds like NOW(Green Day & The Offspring ""pop-punk"" excluded). Never having heard of any of these bands except Nashville Pussy's cover of AC/DC's ""Kicked In the Teeth,"" I didn't know what to expect, but if ANY of the bands had the ""raw-power"" of Nashville Pussy's AC/DC-cover, it would be a find. I've heard it a few-times, and there is some HEAVY ""hardcore-type"" punk/thrash; also some weak ""new wave-like"" ""punk,"" or whatever it is... There are some songs that appeal to me; the HEAVY, HARSH, & ABRASIVE ONES! Some are ""middle-ground"": not quite ""new wave""-sounding, but DEFINETLY NOT HARDCORE-PUNK/Thrash. This CD is like a ""Whitman's sampler"" box of candy: some songs I ""spit-out,"" some I ""chew."" It has enough songs to consume, and it is something DIFFERENT from most 'Various Artist' ""compilations."""
3,Kids love it for some reason,"This didn't really seem to exciting to me. I only bought it due to a sale. You are only able to control the height, it is a bit wobbly which will make it move laterally a bit. It is extremely sensitive to wind. In an almost imperceptible breeze it would continuously flip over immediately after taking off. When it did go it would fly up until it ran out of radio range (50+ ft). My niece (7) loved it."
5,Traditional Regency,"Sometimes I feel I really don't try enough authors out. Yet another I hadn't come across before whose book I throughly enjoyed. Her heroine either wears her spectacles or peers at a world of blobs.From the back of the hardback:She did not wish to marry.. .if she could not marry Nicolas.And as Miss Frideswid Edhorough - familiarly known as Friday- well knew, she could no more marry Nick than fly to the moon.She was plain Friday, a bluestocking, spectacled miss, not even remotely pretty, unlike the females Nick's taste ran to as she could be. It seemed then that she was doomed to spinsterhood... But Friday had reckoned without a father determined to see his daughter - sole heir to the Edborough estate - off the proverbial shelf..."
4,a great read,i had so much fun reading this book...abby and jamie are great characters--the story is the perfect mix of completely unbelievable and totally possible. I confess...I even cried at the end...the boys are dreamy! I only wish there was a sequel so we could follow Abby and Jamie to college!
5,Amazing,"Dirtie Blonde is a such a refreshing alternative to the annoying whining bands with catchy melodies and three chord-songs. Aimee is by far one of the best, if not the best, female vocalist out there, and their songs are written so perfectly and succintly you attach yourself to them as soon as you hear them.....Best album purchase i've made in years."
5,Incredible--Not Just Pop,"Once in awhile a band comes along that you just know is gonna make it, and if they don't, something is wrong with the universe.Dirtie Blonde is one of those bands.Fronted by the incredible pipes of Amie Miriello, these guys have only been together about eight months and already have a major label record deal and have opened for INXS to standing ovations at a sold out Radio City Music Hall. Its been fast. Its been meteoric. And this CD explains why.Those who only know Dirtie Blonde from the infectious hit pop radio single ""Walk Over Me"" are in for a pleasant surprise. What appeared to be a Jessica Simpson clone band is actually a mature, diverse act that will appeal to the teeny-bopper and serious rock and roll lover alike.Support this band. You won't be disappointed."
1,Never Works,"Well, never works is a lie. After we let the cardboard calibrator sit on the globe for 15 minutes and removed it (oh so carefully) we got the globe to levitate, for about 2 minutes before quickly snapping back to the top magnet.It appears that if your house moves whatsoever from people walking or isn't completely level this globe will not work.And to boot (because they know that they're going to get Tech Support calls) there is no way to phone or e-mail the company for assistance."
3,piece of crap,"This thing has to be at an exact distance from top to bottom. If it even moves up or down half an inch it drops. Oh wait, it drops either way. Even when I'm sleeping, this thing suddenly drops. 99% of the time I just leave it dropped because if I hang it to float it's just going to drop within an hour or maybe even 10 minutes."
1,don't bother,"Cool in concept, useless in practice. As far as I can tell, it simply does not work. Wherever the ""sweet wspot"" to make the globe hover between the two magnets is, I have yet to find it, with the globe predictably clinging to one pole or the other.Avoid."
5,Novice's - top find,"Although only a novice and by no means an erudite music critic, Mozart's Requiem has always been a personal (late night) favourite of mine. At last count, I have now collected at least 7 versions on CD/SACD & LP. However, I find this L'Oiseau Lyre - AAM / Hogwood version to have the most emotive and passionate singing as well as being excellently engineered/recorded. The then young Emma Kirby's voice is just sublime in places. This is not a version with just one performer excelling and the others (soloists/orchestra) just along for the ride. All give very strong performances. An exceptional disc which should be in every serious collector's library."
5,A Wealth of Modeling Information!,This book is a must for anyone modeling city scenes. John Pryke shows and tells how to model city scenery realistically. Great photos and suggestions.
2,Not for me.,"I was interested in learning how to make buildings. This is not the book for that. Most of the material consists of which products the artist used to create things, not explanations of how they are created.Some people may find this information useful. I did not."
1,Cd rom in description is deceptive.,"I have been trying to find this video and was happy to see it listed on amazon....I thought. In the description:Microsoft musical instruments. (CD-ROM drive) (Hardware Review) (Evaluation): An article from: NotesI jumped to the conclusion this was a copy of the original cd with its review and evaluation. No so and very disappointed. Would be nice to have seller put in capital letters.....THIS IS NOT THE CD, JUST A REVIEW! Of course maybe that was left out on purpose........... I just paid six bucks for text that told me what I already knew!!!!Not happy!"
3,Perhaps I Am Too Finicky,"The script itself did not adhere to best hypnosis practices by placing suggestions at all points throughout the session.The voice was not restful or pleasant but was intrusive.Several times, the woman swallows and this is recorded faithfully; I have a psychotic aversion to the sound and this always irked me as I listened.On the other hand, the author made a special exception for me and made this CD available after I wrote to her an email; so her heart is in the right place."
4,Getting hairy with Gary Soto,"""Big Bushy Mustache"" combines text by Gary Soto with illustrations by Joe Cepada. They tell the story of Ricky, a young Latino boy. His teacher is planning to have the class put on a play about Cinco de Mayo, and Ricky will get to wear a costume mustache. But Ricky gets into a jam when he disobeys the teacher's instructions.This is a fun book with an effective Latino flavor. Ricky is an engaging young hero. However, there is a weird gender identity subtext surrounding Ricky's feelings about the mustache; in my opinion, this aspect of the story is handled awkwardly. Otherwise this is a good choice for a multicultural collection of children's books."
4,Fun & odd book that children enjoy!,"I really enjoyed this book as it follows a young boy who wishes he had a mustache like his father. The book introduces some spanish words such as, bigote (mustache). The story line is a bit odd but it is an overall fun book that is full of multiculturalism that children seem to enjoy. The illustrations go with the text nicely. I would recommend this book for children 3 years of age and older."
2,Big Bushy Mustache has some explaining to do,"It seems like a cute story at first. But, when the boy disobeys his teacher and sneaks the fake mustache home and loses it, his parents replace it - not with another fakey, but a REAL one! And if the enabling isn't bad enough, how-the-heck does the father get his mustache off in one piece??!! Images of scalping come to mind, and that's kind of freaky. I kept hoping my 2nd grade students wouldn't ask about this, but I tried to be prepared, just in case. Something like, ""kids, the moral of the story is, if you don't want your father to lose his upper lip, better listen to your teacher!"""
2,You lied to me Amazon.com!!!!!!!!!,"I would've given this DVD 5 stars for the ammount of videos & TV appearances on it, but you cost me 3 cause of the fact that you lied to me about the NTSC format description.I ordered it from my small-chain record shop & it came in.I found out it matched the description of the Ebay searches: PAL, region 2!So next time, check your forieng DVDs twice for default formatting before posting them on this website.& if Universal Music USA issues this here in a NTSC All Regions version, I""ll definately be able to give it 5 stars cause I'll be able to play it on my home theatre system."
3,highly over-rated,I think this book is highly over-rated. I found the tiny font very hard to read and the screen captures look like they were made several application generations ago. For my money I'd get something like 3D Animation: From Models to Movies by Watkins or digital 3d design by Danaher.If they updated this book to reference software that people are actually using today and made the font bigger then I think it might merit a higher ranking.
5,Excellent book / not introductory entirely,"I bought this book after seeing it cited in some current research in nanotechnology. I was able to acquire it fairly quickly from Amazon.com even though it was out of print.Despite its title, this book requires at least a moderate knowledge of engineering. A quote from the preface by the author is as follows:""It is hoped that this book will be useful for the older engineer who has become familiar with discrete transistors and who is now faced with the problem of becoming familiar with integrated circuit technology and the world of microelectronics; also to the younger technologist who wishes to know more about these topics.""This book of course also requires a solid understanding of chemistry and calculus. There is no review of basic concepts to be found here.Overall, this book is very helpful in its presentation with several very good diagrams. But, non-engineers be forewarned: this is not an introductory text."
2,Not as expected.,"OK looking cotton tips, but I had expected US made product and received China made. The tips are very hard and and vary greatly from the soft, absorbent ones I ordinarily use."
3,Good book for newly diagnosed lupus patients,"I found this book to be of little use to my own self, as I have had lupus for over thirty years. However: the author's appendix was the best part of the book to me.For newly diagnosed lupus patients, I believe the author does have a lot to offer."
4,Deep...Perceptive...Insightful! I loved it all!!!,"In her highly cerebral style, Eakins once again explores the events of all ages that bear so heavily on our culture. We need to know what has been and what will be if we are to enter the next millenium with confidence. She caters to this fundamental need magnificantly!!!"
5,I couldn't put this book down. Highly recommended!,"Mixing history, reincarnation and the sacred, this fascinating and richly descriptive page-turner ultimately provokes us to ponder what our lives and lifetimes are all about."
3,the item did not correspond to the bottle shown on this page. Delivery was timely and prompt.,"I am generally very satisfied in dealing with Amazon. At times, hoever, the item ordered did not quite match with the image shown on the screen. For example, in the case of items like perfumes from Givenchy. That should be corrected."
2,Dull in the beginning than gets to the meat.,"The first ten chapters are dull & very boring. Once the trial begins so does the excitement. I was always expecting a surprise twist, however, I never expected the ending we had. The last chapter was the best in the whole book. The Court room drama was exciting and The fact that the cops were trying to frame the Judge was exciting and it took me a while before I could figure out why they wanted to frame him. Police Corruption and the Judge's investigation were the culprits. For the price, the reading was ok, I didn't care for the writing style. For someone beginning to ready mystries, you may take a go on this one."
3,Unfinished Business,The book was good until the ending which was over in a flash and left many unanswered questions.
2,Blind-sided by the ending....once again,Martini has yet again quickly undone an entertaining story with a shockingly improbable ending. Ifyou've read Prime Witness you'll be subjected to the very same ending. I'm surprised it wasallowed out the door. It's like someone just took an ax and cut the tail off some dog of a story andjammed it on to page 378. I don't understand why Martini goes through all that work only todestroy it..
1,Bad main character makes bad book,"""The Capital County Courthouse has more leaks than a pack of dogs with bad kidneys....""This is the first Martini book I have tried to read. Okay, maybe this is just how the main character thinks, but there is at least one of these bad lines every three or four pages. It grated on my nerves. It made me dislike the main character. It made me hate the story. It made me dislike Martini as an author. It made me not want to read any more of his books."
3,"Pleasant book, realistic it is not","Being in the legal field, I have fun reading legal thrillers. The Judge is a fast read and enjoyable but realistic it is not. The main character is an attorney, Madriani, who is drawn into defending Judge Acosta in a murder trial. Madriani throughout the story breaks laws, lawyers ethical rules, and attorney client rules. He would be disbarred in the real world. Plus he isn't quick enough to catch a major piece of evidence that is basically dropped in his lap until the very end of the story. The story moves quickly both in the courts and by reading. Suspending any real world legal knowledge made it more enjoyable. I think a little more realistic take on being a lawyer would have worked, maybe Mr. Martinin didn't have the time to figure out others ways to achieve the same end results but without destroying his main character's character."
5,Seems to keep the oil clean so far,"I use these filters exclusively when I change my own oil. So far the car has more than 225,000 miles and never had any kind of engine problem. I attribute part of the reason to doing prompt oil changes and using good filters like this one. The feature I really like, though, is the texture grip on the bottom. It makes it easy for me to unscrew the filter by hand. So far I haven't had to use a tool to unscrew the filter because of the grip."
3,Collar comes off too easy,Lost 2 collars within a week of putting them on the dog. They need to be secured with a zip tie for best results.
4,Works Great,One of the better flea collars for some reason the drops dont work with my black lab so i got one of these and never looked back
1,2 dogs works kinda on one hurt the other!,i bought 2 of thease collars for my dogs as part of getting rid of the fleas in my house along with the powder and the spray. put it on my pitbull and she has a oozing wound on her neck from where the collar was after having it on for a short time imediatly took it off and it started to heal put another one on my pit boxer mix and he hasent had any bad reaction but he still has fleas even with the collar and a perscription from the vet none of the hartz products really worked to kill the fleas
5,A Must Have!,"'The Dinner Party' is notable - not only for its beautiful art - but also for its amazing synopsis of women in history. If you are looking for a summary of the multitude of contributions by women, GET THE BOOK. The art is beautiful, stiking, and magical, the text is equally compelling. Especially recommended for art history, women's studies, etc"
2,So So book,Not at all what I expected. I saw the original show in Chicago many years ago and loved the plates and covers Very colorful and was disapponted in this offering.
