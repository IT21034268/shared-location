1,Savannah Snooze,"I can't believe so many people actually liked this book. After about 50 pages I couldn't stand all the errors. Who edited this book? I want to send it back to the publisher and demand my money back! This book had me so frustrated that after a while I couldn't concentrate on anything but the errors and really didn't care what happened to the two dementional, unbelievable characters. The premise of the book was good - it could have been a great read if someone else had written it."
1,"cloying Southern ""charm""","Take your first warning from the fact that the main protagonist calls herself ""Weezie."" Everyone has a cutsie Southern nickname and some endearing personality quirk. Then there's the whole Uncle James subplot, told from his point of view, which is might have been interesting but ends up seeming like just another gimmick thrown into the mish-mash of contrivances that make up this novel. The book tries WAY too hard, in my opinion. Usually I like this sort of thing (Edgerton, Pearson, Welty, Dufresne) but this just goes over the top and leaves no real meat behind."
2,Boring,The characters in this book were made out to be nothing more than dumb broads as the old saying goes. I was disappointed to the highest.
5,Good Entertainment,"I liked this book. Actually I REALLY liked this book. There are some little factual errors that may muddle the mind of the most finicky of readers but as long as you understand going in that this book isn't meant to be fine literature you won't be disappointed. That being said it is a good read and as far as chick lit goes, very well written and entertaining. Books fulfill many needs for their readers and this one is pure mind candy. It isn't heavy, deep literature with political or social overtones. It's a fun read that isn't too taxing but it isn't trash either. I think I'll call it great Entertainment Fiction and leave it at that."
3,Savannah blues,"Entertaining, easy read. Nice description of Savannah and environs. Entertaining story plot and characters. I would recommend to my friends"
3,Savannah Blues,"Good plot - real life Southern dialogue/situations. Love the antique/collectables angle, so popular now. Worth your time, maybe not worth the price."
3,Really funny in parts,Good characters and situations and very funny in some parts. The plot could have flowed better among the characters. A fun read.
2,Not as Good as the Callahan Garrity Series,"I was extremely disappointed in this series and I really wanted to like it. I preferred the author when she wrote under her real name ""Katy Hogan Trochek"" as I really enjoyed the characters in the Callahan Garrity series. Its funny; I actually didn't like Callahan and I didn't like Weezer in this series. The family and friends they surround themselves with are more fleshed-out and interesting than the main characters. Both heroines are annoying, petty, rude and not very likeable."
4,"a light, entertaining book","I really enjoyed this book. It is a light,entertaining book. As I'm not from Savannah, the ""inaccuracies"" another posted mentioned didn't bother me as I didn't know they were inaccurate. I just made my own little fictitious town in my mind from the authors descriptions. I am planning to read more of this author's books as I really liked ""Savannah Blues""."
1,"Cliches, cheesy, hated it","I suppose a lot of reviewers loved the book, but personally I hated it. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I felt the plot was flimsy, there were far too many silly details and very little in terms of character depth. As a Southerner far from home, I love reading books about the South. I'm actually from Beaufort, only an hour away from Savannah. However, I really don't feel the author portrayed the South in an accurate light (a 30 year old heroine who wears a yellow linen short set after 1985 is embarrassing). Also there was a silly plug for ""shag"" music and the romance scenes were ridiculous. I feel these examples show the author should have stuck with characters in her own age range. I guess as a beach read it's OK, but I would personally rather put my time to better use."
4,JUST STARTED,I HAVE JUST STARTED READING THIS BOOK. IT'S A LITTLE SLOW GETTING STARTED AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHERS.
4,Great Mystery book,"This book was very good, it was set in South Carolina.The main character, Weezie Foley is an antique dealer and she gets herself wrapped up in mystery of a murder when she is staking out a estate sale. Because she was in the house, peeking at the antiques, they think she did it.I liked that the author talks about the various antiques and thesales that Weezie goes to during the book to find out who really killed Caroline Santos ( who happens to be the girlfriend of her ex husband).I recommend this book, but I would have like to have read a little better ending, and would have liked the author tohave a ""better bang"" of an ending."
5,The great escape,"After 9 years of not reading for fun (after the birth of a challenging child) and with the confirmation that my husband would be overseas with the military for a year I picked up this book with the vow to make time for myself. What fun! I laughed outloud, couldn't wait to find time to read and was disappointed only that the story ended. The test was lively and flowed as if I was engaged in the conversation. Awesome, fun, non-pondering reading. Isn't that what reading for pleasure is all about? I have passed it on to 4 friends. I so enjoyed it that I bought the follow-up in hardback and about choked on the expense of a new hardbook. But I savored it too."
4,Road Trip Asset,"Savannah Blues was a good audio book passenger on my recent roadtrip.When chasing the milemarkers, I need a light story to keep me awake and this was definitely it! The story had enough twists to keep me interested. The culinary descriptions were so tempting that I really wanted to find a roadside diner like BeBe's.The book on CD served its purpose---I didn't fall asleep at the wheel!"
5,I love it!,The quality is great. The Celludoid binding on body is delicate. I play it every day and I love the resonance.
3,"Half good, half bad","I'd give the last half of this combination album, the Gershwin sides five stars. It shows off Chris in the best possible way...good miking, and she's at her improvisatory best. The first part, the In Person is simply awful in that the miking shoves her way over to the left side and mutes her voice. It's nearly unlistenable. I'd say download the Gershwin tracks and skip getting this combined CD."
4,Delightful,Chris Connor is truly a jazz vocalist in the right. Her live performance on this cd seems as if you were there in the audience. Her rendition of Senor Blues is great.
3,This is the wrong battery for my IBM Thimkpad 380ED,"I did not buy it because I found out my Thinkpad 380ED uses a tiny CR1220 3v Lithium button-cell battery that just poopes out of the holder, found at Radio Shack for about $6, and elsewhere.I think the battery pictured is the wrong kind, maybe for the older model 380 Thinkpad?"
1,Didn't Work,It was wired incorrectly. I changed the connection pins to match the OEM and it still didn't work!!!!
5,"The true definition of ""keeping it real""","How beautiful is this album? How soulful is this album? How real is it? You just can't calculate. One of the unfortunate consequences of passing time is that it becomes less and less likely that albums this good will ever be commonplace again. Jazz? Pop? Soul? It doesn't quite sound like any of those...it just is what it is, a record that sounds like your dearest old friend right from the first time you hear it. One of the greatest albums ever, no exaggeration."
4,Pieces of a Man,Very expressive with a major message. Events of ones life and frustration are heard throughout the CD. If one is is a true Gil Scott Herron fan this is a piece to enjoy and reflect on your life's adventure.
4,A Review,"Great music overall. However Gill's vocal range is quite limited, but his lyrics make up for them."
5,sublime sounds from the seventies,"An album that's as life-affirming today as when it was released. After the brilliant, still fresh, Black Power opener it settles into a more mellower groove which greatly rewards with repeated listenings. Though more eclectic, like Marvin Gaye's 'What's Goin' On', it combines state-of-the-nation insights with spiritually uplifting musical arrangements. An over-looked classic."
1,Disappointing!,"The product conflicted with other software I had installed on my computer andtheir tech support basically told me I was outta luck. They offer an ""upgrade&quot... they don't offer the download version in their upgrade (their customer service told me I was outta luck). The Career counselor is not all it cracks up to be...very hokey and somewhat cheesy. Inputting into the program (once I get it running and ""debugged"") is fairly easy but the formats aren't very attractive. I was able to import it into my Word Processor (MSW) but it lost all formatting when I imported it. This was a very disappointing piece of software."
3,Some good - most bad,"'Billy's Song' is why I bought this CD. 'The Goodbye' was a very pleasant surprise and I was hoping for others. However, the rest of the tracks represent the sort of music they used to play in cinemas in the 60s when we queued for icecreams or as the soundtrack for forgettable advertisements. I know a lot of jazz and pop CDs are like this - it's just sad to be caught again."
5,"The best book of the year, the century even?","This book was fantastic. Where at first there was some kind of, irratic, and clouded judgement, but then the book sheds some light on the hard issues of the ripper case.The victims... the suspects...This book is amazing.But i dont want to spoil the ending. Enjoy."
5,Beautiful musicianship with much feeling and passion.,"I have recently become more interested in classical guitar. I find the instrument very personable, and listening to the wonderful performance by Ana Vidovic, I have been inspired enough to start lessons on that instrument and that style of playing. I truly love this cd. On a few occasions when feeling depressed and discouraged, listening to this cd is very inspirational. When I hear it, I don't feel alone. At least for me, this performance really nourishes my soul. Ana has helped me to be bitten by the classical guitar bug. Looking forward to hearing much more from this terrific young artist! Just to be honest, I'm not a musical whiz or egg head, but I know when something really grips my heart and gives it a few squeezes, and makes me feel alive again after 69 years. Thanks Ana!!"
4,Excellent technique,"Ana is going to be someone to watch out for for years to come. Seeing her live is simply a rare treat in life. A true master, at least in my eyes. The only reason I rated this a 4/5 is because of her incredible speed. It's absolutely mind bogling how fast and accurate she can play, yet is speed the right thing in all situations? Example. The first track. Ana stuns you with 'how fast she can move through the piece.' I sat and listened to this track, comparing it to another master, Julian Bream. Ana moves through the piece with computer percission. Julian flows through the piece at over a minute slower. He seems to be in complete control of speed, accuracy, and emotion. Ana was quite young when this was recorded, and I have been impressed with her later work. I enjoy this recording for what it is. A young master that has perfected the technical aspect to her playing. I'm not going to say slow down, or copy Bream. Continue to grow, and develope. I'll keep listening."
5,Lynn's third time is a charmer,"Denise Lynn's third Falcon book - Falcon's Love - follows her series for Harlequin Historical (Falcon's Desire, February 2003; Falcon's Honor, March 2005). It is another gem from a verypromising Historical Romance writer.Darius of Faucon is sent on a mission by his king. Actually, it's a two-purpose mission - he is there to protect the widow of Thornson Keep until a new husband can be found for her and to toss a medieval monkey wrench in a ring of smugglers operating in the area. Darius already knows the lass. Marguerite, Lady of Thornson was Darius' childhood friend, his first love. Darius harbors some bruised feelings since she wed another.Marguerite always loved Darius, but in true Medieval style, was forced to wed another. She hasn't forgotten the passion they once shared or the secret that love left her with. However, shecannot have Darius around. There are too many truths he might discover.A delightful tale that leaves you hoping more Falcons fly our way."
5,The saga continues,I love this author. Found her books by accident and have been reading my way thru them. This is the story of the youngest Faucon brother. The interaction between these two strong people is wonderful. Neither one is a downtrodden victim and yet they show a deep love and concern for each other. Denise Lynn has a way of creating fun dialogue within the strong romance and at the same time painting a descriptive background. I recommend reading all four books in this series as they are all wonderful.
4,Exceptional...........,"i love this story, i love these characters.............i love Ms Lynn's style of writing.Darius is a hunk!"
4,Greed is good.....so is this book,"If you love Milken and Boesky and inspired to be one,this book is for you. In this book God had give us the answer why you and and me cannot be billioinaires.Look at page 10.""Breakfast was served at 6 A.M., a concession to popular tastes by Milken, who was at his desk each day by 4.30 A.M."""
2,"Very Detailed, but Grossly Inaccurate","Quite obviously Ms. Bruck did her homework on this book because there is much detail. However, her continual usage of the word ""junk"" to always refer to any type of high-yield security shows that she has passed sentence before the trial.Most of the book is a very detailed account of what happened, but clearly she does not understand the economics or the legal aspects of any of the deals therein. She portrays Michael Milken as a devious crook, yet reality characterizes him much differently. Ms. Bruck attacks the deals but has no idea what makes them good or bad, so she assumes wealth-making to be evil."
1,"Lame excuse for a ""box set""",I ordered this as a gift for someone that enjoys Elton John. This is a good set of his first 3 albums which in my opinion were the only decent ones. Amazon messed up the shipping and sent a Bon Jovi box set instead. I know Elton John and Bon Jovi are of the same caliber when it comes to talent but that was a mistake that this person is forced to listen to.
4,Pinball at Home,I have this pinball machine..It is fun for the smaller kids..But the teenagers don't find it all that great...The legs on the game are pretty wobbley and sometimes certain numbers don't show up on the scoreboard...This game is alright for someone ages 8 to 11..
2,Monoply Pinball,"The machine is very unstable. Talk about ""TILT""!! It is really wobbly. If I could do it again, I would pass on this machine/toy."
3,2001 sienna repiar manuel,"This book is OK for mechanical on most things,but it doesn't give anything on body repair such as door handle replacement,bumper,head light etc."
5,Cheap,Repair manual was very helpful. I was able to save lot of money on repair of the car as I my self did did repair.
1,A Very Deceptive Documentary,"This film is a monument to yellow journalism. The numerous factual errors and misconceptions pervading this ""documentary"" suggest that the authors are either severely biased or sadly naive. This is activist propaganda, not objective work. And I write this as someone who is no friend of the subject corporation."
3,"Live Action: BAD, Animation: GOOD","Classic video. The live action sceners in it STINK. They keep putting SFX in for no reason (Mario and Luigi hug, and they play the 1-up music.) However, the cartoon part makes up for it. When Fryguy tries to kill Toad, Mario and Luigi must save him in a BMX race made by King Koopa!"
1,"A Peace of his mind, alright.","What a load of crap. This isn't poetry, this is amateurish drivel. Any real poets should be offended by this ""work""."
4,High Quality In-Flight Entertainment,"One part E.T., two parts Flowers for Algernon, one-third part The Absent Minded Professor, one-and-a-half parts musical, all parts fun! Koi...Mil Gaya is the heartwarming tale of an eleven-fingered halfwit and a supernatural alien who (despite all odds) discover the true meaning of friendship, get the girl for the good guy, and beat the baddies, all without missing a dance step. Truly a film for the ages (and for all ages)."
3,E.T. has a new name : JADOO,in this indian version of e.t u see a mentally underdeveloped person who gets magical powers by an alien who gets his powers recharged by sun & takes it back when he goes back to his place.if you have not switched off before the ending then u will find that the alien returns the powers.he has a heart too and he can understand even speak hindi(the UNIVERSAl language eh?).HRITHIK does a wonderful job however.he is the brightest star in bombay film industry today.he dances like god(even MJ cant do some of his steps i bet on that(bet is a dvd of this movie).dvd has not the quality of hollywood movies.dvd s of this movie (may be pirated are in great demand in india).still a fun movie should watch it once .
2,Not his best,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter is a huge Munch fan and likes this one well enough, but it's my least favourite. She tends to memorize books and quote them constantly, and I'm not thrilled with the ""hey, you dumb...."" mantra. This is kind of minor, but how was it that the pigs showed up at school after Megan locked them back in at home? If you're wanting to add to your Munch collection, he's written better. Alligator Baby and Thomas's Snowsuit are fun without the insults and a little more logically consistent."
1,Edges of book chewed off,"Edges were chewed off by either a child teething or a hungry mouse, Yuk will not give to my granddaughter who I purchased for"
1,!!!!~~~~~@@@@@####$$$$%%%%^^^^&&&&****(((()))),"I liked this book (somewhat) because meagan kept on getting squshed and how they ended up in the pig-pen.I would recomend this book to people with pigs because they would know that pigs cant do all that stuff and would actually think it is funny I think that is one of the worst robert munsch books, even though it was ok(there are better book's)"
5,"more mature,but equally enjoyable","this album is a step forward to what was WBIEF..especially in the guitar work...songs like the emotional ""discovering the waterfront""..the full of angst ""smile in your sleep""...""already dead"" (with that superb riff)..are what gives this album 5 stars"
3,Silverstein losing their touch?,"Ok well ill get straight to the point on this one, this is an EMO album strickly emo, i do like how they put it together tho, the perfect opening song for this album and the fact it comes with a dvd with interveiws and the music videos makes it worth it even more, anyways this cd isnt the best one out there in fact i bet alot of people would prefer the older album, there is alot improved such as vocals lyrics and sound, this cd is worth checking out but if you dont like emo then forget this cd for sure..."
4,Good hardcore sound.,Great CD. Real tight sound. Nice mix of screaming/singing. Probably only hardcore fans would enjoy the sound. Would have given it 5 stars but the guitars sometimes give it the feel of an 80's hair band!
1,stop all the crying,"I can't stand listening to this guy crying in every song. Whatever it is that has made him so sad, he needs to get over it and sing like he has testicles. I can't wait for this band to come to my city so I can punch the singer in his face and break his jaw so that it has to be wired shut."
4,Almost Perfect,"This is a great album. I was a little worried getting it that silverstein might have ""toned it down"" a little bit, like many other bands have been doing lately. If anything, the screaming has gotten more intense. It reminds me a lot of the screamer from Beloved, his voice is deeper now. The songs that aren't as hard are great too. I would have given it 5 stars, but theres always room for improvement. I think its a great buy for anyone who liked their first cd. you won't be disappointed...plus the dvd it comes with is great, and it also has a segment on it about another of my favorite bands, bayside. so go get it."
5,great book,this book is great it has lots of info on how to grow hydo marijauna and there are many great techniques on how to grow. its a great book and well worth buying.
2,donating this to the library,"As an avid lover of Pilates I was disappointed in the Stability Ball Challenge workout. I decided to use my Bally Fitness Center membership and get up early for the 5:30 a.m. class, using 2-1/2 pound ankle weights to make the workout more challenging. Because of that, I won't watch this DVD again. Waste of money. Thank you!"
4,Wow,"This book contains amazing info about placebo, research, and the practice of medicine.I found it hard to get into his using-the-placebo-effect-for-your-own-health section... and it seemed kind of awkward that the book was divided in half... half-research and discussion, and the other half application...But it's well worth it for the first part."
4,"Review of ""Rookie Year""",A wonderful read. The author has really captured the flavor of teaching in the inner city. Dr. Reed immediately grabs you and makes you care. I think that all teachers and students should read this one. It just might have a positive effect on the behavior on both sides of the desk.
5,We heart Arthur,I like that there are so many episodes in the seasons and so many seasons available for free on Amazon Prime
5,"in response to ""a reader""","I just want to respond to the review by ""a reader."" Jonathan Kozol was in fact an educator, and if you're read any of his other works, such as ""Death at an Early Age,"" he gives us personal accounts from his own teaching. He is an amazing writer, and very powerful in the field of education. If you do not agree with his ""conspiracy theories"" that is fine, but please do not make it seem as if he is not qualified to write about what he does."
3,anti-establishment activist writes a book,"I now know that an anti-war protester from the sixties can write a book on education. The book was full of conspiracy theories of how the system is indoctrinating both students and teachers. I do think people wanting to be a teacher should read it,so they know that anti-establishment educators are still around.The truth is in my opinion that teachers should teach more respect for tradition,and more patriotism.Students already have no respect for authority and this book suggest we go one step more.The book was interesting as well,especially if you dont agree with the authors point of view."
2,For beginners only,"As someone who frequently uses and teaches classes on Microsoft Project, I found this book only marginally useful. For beginners, this is probably a very good book, particularly when used in conjunction with the supplied CD. However, for one who has a working knowledge of the product, it offers little detail on this very complex application. Unfortunately, in MS Project the devil is very much in the detail."
2,Monotone and Unenthusiastic... to the point it would drive you crazy,"The voice on this CD could not possibly be any more boring or monotone than it already is.The level of enthusiasm projected by the speaker is enough to turn anyone off from learning how to speak Spanish.I have many other audio learning aids, for Spanish and other languages. This is by far the worst to listen to. It sounds like a bored robot speaking."
1,Bad piece of software,"I really enjoyed using Study Spanish in your Car -- that was the foundation of what Spanish I have learned. I enjoyed that series so much that when I had gone through all 100+ lessons I am paying a graduate student at my University to create more MP3's in this genre that were tailored to my interests. So I was hoping for more of same. No. An endless, boring, useless list of verbs. Total waste of money. No use at all. Get the ""Study Spanish in your car"" series but don't bother with this one."
4,"Well made, but would have been nice if they mentioned clips weren't included","This is a well made screen that provides good ventilation. I would have appreciated them mentioning that clips are not included. I got it only to realize that I needed to order clips seperately (and pay more). If you're ordering this for a pet rodent, you know they're escape artists. I would have given it 5 stars had the clips been included. It wouldn't have cost the seller much more and would make for happier customers."
4,Marillion keeps doing what they know best,"The second single of Somewere Else -The first one was the download only See It Like A Baby- is double A-side. With the beautiful Thankyou Whoever You Are, a passionate song for the new found love, and the hippy rocker Most Toys, that sounds like an experiment in psycodelia, it's energetic and fun. The songs climbed to the 15 spot in the UK charts, and 6 in Holland. Not to bad for a band that have been in the bussines since 1978!It also includes the excellent track Circular Ride, and a live version of The Wound, exclusive to the single.A great single for the hardcore fan or the new ones.You will love it for shure."
2,Errors all over!,If you are looking for a German language book do yourself a favor and do not buy this book.The German segments are packed with errors in grammar and spelling.
4,I only gave it 4 stars?,"I was a huge Osmond fan from '70-'76. This album came out towards the end of their success. I like some of the tunes, but Hey Mr. Taxi just gives me a headache. After Crazy Horses and the anti-pollution message and this album and it's LDS/religion theme, even I started wondering if the guys couldn't do an album without a theme behind it. If anything helped kill their careers, it was this LP. If they would've come out with a real hard rocking album, they would've lasted longer as serious artists. The Osmonds weren't about that though. They had much to say and used their music to say it."
1,This isn't rock,"This is religion crap all together in an album. Im so sick of these albums. If you want real rock, then get into Disturbed, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, or Korn."
4,"Wow, I remembered all the words!","I bought this because it was one of the first albums I ever owned. I remembered it being a concept album, and I remembered loving it, but until I popped this into the cd player, I had know idea I would remember all the words to all the songs after almost 30 years.It seems a little dated (obviously) and Donnie fans should be aware that he doesn't sing lead on everything, but I actually still think this is an excellent album."
3,osmonds,I can't help but think they are down to tier last ten milion and had to put something out to get some MORE cash flow going
3,very small - for a child,more for a child/ teenager/young girl than adult- i returned it for that reason. the return service was very effective.
3,The Role of Anthropology in Outer Space!,"This is a great book! What a sub-title! Although this book has a ""Chariots of the Gods"" type of feel to it, the authors take their work very seriously. I gleaned a lot of information from this book that I was able to reference in a report for a college class in ""Culture Change"", and it was enjoyable to boot! Too bad such a rare gem is no longer in print. I hope they bring it back."
3,Marred by lack of diction,"The singing is beautiful, melodious and full of harmony. The organ would make Bach proud.But the lyrics do not stand out. In fact, they are obliterated by the surrounding melodies.I hate to do this, but I am comparing with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. These little boys would learn from them.It is a pity that these grand lyrics should be obscured by inept singing by a choir of young boys and men."
5,LACK OF DICTION?!!!,"Obviously the individual who wrote the review including the ""marred by lack of diction"" remark is not too familiar with the traditional boychoir sound. I am moved to sickness that they were so openly compared with the sound of the all-too-familiar MTC. THOSE WERE ADULTS!!! These are boys! Boys cannot give the kind of sound of the MTC because their voices are not developed enough. The greatest hope a boychoir has of wowing audiences is in their contrast in dynamics. They model this beautiffully in their acapella pieces. In their accompanied pieces, I feel they hold their own above the (sometimes blearing) organ.Know the genre a little better before you slander a great performance."
5,Islamic Lit.,Best source of early Islamic history. Volumes 7-16 are the ones which directly concern the issue of Islmaic Political Ideology.
5,Revlon Age Defying Makeup is Age Defying,"Revlon Age Defying Light Makeup is really age defying. It has an SPF of 30 and blends beautifully while minimizing wrinkles and other flaws. Unfortunately, Revlon chose to discontinue this product."
4,A Trip Worth Taking,"Not really a ""comeback"" cd, as many have suggested. It came out only a year or so after their last cd. But definitely a change of pace. Most of it is a change for the better, as the Knack expand their musical genre. There is still plenty of power pop to satisfy your sweet tooth. The Knack also mixes in some Beatlesque tunes such as We Are Waiting and Sweet Dreams, where Doug Fieger sounds eerily like John Lennon. They also delve into some world music (Africa) and some country (Pay the Devil). Overall, a good album worth listening to."
4,Amazing pictures.,"Greetings:I'm a jeweler who specializes in reproductions of early iron age jewelry. A friend loaned me a copy, and my next stop was here to try to find one. The pictures alone are worth the money: all full colour, and detailed. I haven't had a chance to read the whole thing yet, but the research seems pretty solid, and the book itself is well laid out. They also illustrate pieces that seldom get published, and areas that recieve little coverage in the ""celtic"" world press. (Iberian Celts & Ostrogoths, for example.) It should tell you something that I'm not going to hesitate to spend $40 for the thing."
4,A must view,If you wandered what it's like to be a denizen of the lower barrios of Mexico and then to be inside the penal system? This is a movie you should watch.
2,Three attempts and still at page three,"I got to page three on three occasions and it's now collecting dust. Owen Lattimore may have been a explorer and a beacon for sensible China research during the US witch hunt days, but this isn't gripping travel writing. Maybe it's the fact that he uses old fashioned transliteration of Chinese names, I don't know, but I just couldn't get into it.I'll definitely try again, another time. First hand accounts from explorers heading off into the wild blue yonder are normally hard to put down. If ony Lattimore could write like Great Game guru Peter Hopkirk. What a shame."
3,He sure is and was one the last poets,"A blues poet even if the only sound you hear, apart for the last two tracks, is his voice and bongos. But this is the scheme and the inner seed of blues. He uses terms Robert Johnson was not allowed, the rage of someone who doesn't want to be in an underdog position and his attack to the systems has names and faces.At the same time he makes you laugh teasing and fooling the central power in Washington D.C. Ok it was many years ago but this sort of modern ""call and response"" (all by hisself) can still scare.The music in the end arrives with ""Who'll pay repairation on my soul"": same political and social topic but, hey, that's pure soul.A big applause."
2,Not as pictured,"I've been using these bags for years. I purchased 2 packages and was surprised to find that what is inside the package is not what is pictured on Amazon, or on the packaging itself. Instead of what was pictured, I rec'd this:Range Clean Foil Refill Bags-5 PackHad I known that, I would not have purchased them. I don't know if the original style was discontinued or not, but I'll contact Range Kleen directly. I don't care for these new ones at all."
5,makes clean up easy,I love having the fat trapper by my stove to handle any hot oil. I just pour the pan out into the bag and when it gets full toss it away. So much easier than waiting tell the pan cools and using paper towels to wipe it clean.
3,Nice but seal could be better,"These bags are sturdy and hold the grease from a large roast beef cooked in my slow cooker. The down side is the seal on the bags. Its a simple pressure seal like those in a zip lock bag. Personally, I'll never seal one of these bags and throw it in the trash. I'm too affraid the seal might come loose and I'd end up with a puddle of grease under my trash bag. To overcome this, I placed two of the bags in my freezer. I took them out on trash day (the grease was frozen) and placed them in the trash bag. Worked great! I consider my grease problem solved and would rate this five stars if the bag seal were better."
4,Does a Good Job,"I've used the fat trapper bags for several years now in both the rv and the home. The bags are a little pricey, but have never leaked even with hot grease and they are a nice size. When used in the fat trapper bucket, they hold up well and keep the odor out of the kitchen."
5,Clean at last,"I live in the country so garbage disposals are a no no. These work awesome!! I bought more last week!! They work better then the bags that were originally made for the container, which were discontinued!!"
5,Delictable!!!,"This cd is really, really great. I am a clarinetist, and I know of most of the works by Mozart for clarinet but until I had bought this disk, I had never heard of his Divertimentos for 2 clarinets and bassoon. Well, when I got this cd, I started to search for the sheetmusic for these wonderful pieces and found them. Anyway, this cd is just amazing. Takashima, Okazaki, and Berkes shine!! The recording is clear appearantly the music is well prepared. They must have spent a lot of time preparing for this recoring because these are not easy pieces. Dont let the price fool you. This cd could hold its own among all of those expensive recordings. So, all in all, this is a superb recording at an even better price!!!"
1,rubbish,"There is no way to say it nicely, this DVD is utter rubbish. The sound quality is so poor I've have had to turn up the volume on my TV to maximum to hear it and even then the guitar sounds are difficult to hear. My TV is a new widescreen model with HIFI speakers. For a DVD that is supposed to be about Jazz this is completely unacceptable."
5,"Great Product, but $24.59 is a ridiculous price","I bought mine at one of the big hardware chains for a fraction of this price, and they did a great job. Shop around for a sane price, and you will get some really useful items. Every house should have these."
2,sliders,"I should have paid closer attention to the size of these but I wanted to move a bookcase, so I bought them. They were way too small for these bookcases. Had to look elsewhere and buy something bigger."
1,Way too small,"I guess I didn't pay much attention to the size of these things. They were ridiculously small and I paid more for shipping then I paid for the product. It was the first time I felt ripped off. However, that is what I get for not looking at the dimensions."
4,Good Un-shredded Blues.,"For those who had never heard of Tommy Castro, he is one of those younger bluesman who is keeping blues music wholesome because he did not choose to play blues as an alternative prior to the demise of guitar shredding heavy metal nor did he try to fill the void Stevie Ray Vaughan had left behind. Hence his playing and singing style is still very much his own with a strong anchor to the masters of electric blues of Freddie King to Buddy Guy. He also borrows a lot singing licks from the Stax/Volt stable of Otis Redding to Joe Tex. The end results ? White boy blues with a tinge of Blue-eyed soul. His slightly overdriven Strat guitar tone compliments perfectly with his slightly raspy singing voice and with the addition of some horns on a couple of tracks, you can almost figure out how this album will sound like. Buy it if you think Kenny Wayne Shepard is playing too many notes for a blues player and that Jonny Lang is a tad too young to actually interpret the blues."
4,BLUES ROCK,"THIS CD KICKS FROM THE FIRST SONG ON.THE SONG MY TIME AFTER AWHILE REALLY SHOWS HOW GOOD TOMMY CAN PLAY WHEN HE IS PLAYING BLUESROCK HE IS AT HIS BEST.THIS IS BY FAR HIS BEST CD,I OWN ALL OF HIS OTHER CD`S AS WELL.IF YOU WANT A GOOD BLUES ROCK CD THIS IS FOR YOU."
4,Another Strong One,"Another strong album from Castro and his band. Once again most of the songs on the album are originals with a couple of tasty covers thrown in. Tommy tackles Steve Schuffert's ""Suitcase Full Of Blues"", Albert King's ""Can't You See What You Are Doing To Me"", and one of the album highlights ""My Time After Awhile"". This song has become a staple of his live show as well. The original stuff is mostly good too with ""Can't Keep A Good Man Down"", ""You Knew The Job Was Dangerous"", ""Nobody Loves Me Like My Baby"", and the instrumental ""Hycodan"" all being highlights. This is another great rockin blues album from Castro."
1,Painful and precious,"I like the idea of this book but I did not like the execution. It's too cutesy-pie. I did not think the characters were well-developed (Alex and Peter seem like the same person),and I did not think their relationship was very interesting. And I COULD NOT STAND the fact that Alex's mother is constantly hanging around! I hope the next book is better than this."
4,Funny,"Recently seeing this movie, it is funny and classic. The populars sign their friend (The basketball star) up for bowling club, and eventually comes to love it. Although the 7-10 split method was hardly real at all, the movie shows how life can really be. Other great Disney Channel movies: BRINK>PHANTOM OF THE MEGAPLEX>RIGHT ON TRACK>QUINTS."
5,A 299 game for the Alley Cats,"The movie is what got me into bowling. I love bowling and the only thing I gave it up for was education. The movie is a fun movie which is one in which I really miss from the old Zoog Disney days. I will mention though that the movie's protagonists don't have very good form (They don't follow through unlike East Appleton), but the main point is combing to unlikely people to become friends, and bowling is the best way to feature it. :)"
1,1.5. didnt like this one,"i like alot of disney channel original movies this one i didnt like very much. no. its not because i dont like to bowl because i do like bowling. but for some reason i just wasnt feelin this movie. if u want a good disney original movie watch. RIP GIRLS, JOHNNY TSUNAMI,MIRICALE IN LANE 2, OR TRY SEVENTEEN AGAIN. I HAVE OTHERS BUT THESE ARE SOME THAT I LIKE."
5,1200 TC SHEETS WONDERFUL,"LOVE THESE SHEETS!!!! DEEP POCKETS, WASH UP NICELY AND SOFT. A DEFINATE SMART PURCHASE."
4,"Nice sheets, but not quite as soft as I thought they'd be.","Only includes 2 king size pillow cases. If you have standard size pillows also, you have to buy them separately."
3,"Great sheets, but wrinkly","These sheets are soft, great weight, high quality. However, they come out of the dryer very wrinkled. Much better result if you can hang them outside. For the price, the very best sheets I ever purchaed."
4,"Great Sheets, but beware of color.","These are great quality sheets. However, the ""parchment"" color sheets have a muave-rose tint."
3,Stiff as a board.,"I have washed these sheets several times and yet they are still stiff. They will last a lifetime I am sure because they are so thick. They are like canvas. I am going to keep trying to soften them, but I don't think they will get much softer."
4,Thick sheets,These sheets are of great quality...they are quite heavy and wash well. They do wrinkle a lot though and require ironing before placing on the bed.
4,Heavyweight,This was my first experience with high thread count sheets. They are soft and they are much heavier than normal weight sheets. They are noisy until they have been washed a few times. Good overall quality. Fit my Select Comfort mattress well.
2,Not nice to sleep on (after washed),"We were excited to have another Sateen sheet set for our king bed. The sheet is nice sized and fits our pillow top just fine the issue remains with the softness. Frankly, it felt like we were sleeping on Polyester sheets, not 1200 thread count cotton. We washed them with frabric softener and bounce and they felt like that!! I was unimpressed to say the least. True 59.99 was a great price but, quality is NOT anywhere similar to Ralph Lauren sateen. The cotton was cheaper and anyone that reates these differently, simply hasn't slept on high quality bedding. It will work nice to cover plants for Florida winter wind chill :-)"
3,It is not wrinkle free,I expected these sheets to be a little softer than they are and after the first wash and dried they were completely wrinkled. You will not need a blanket if you are sleeping under these sheets.
3,1200 Thread Count Sateen Sheets,"These sheets are VERY thick and heavy duty. However, they are not nearly as soft as I'd expected them to be considering they are supposed to be 1200 thread count. More scratchy than soft. I have a set of sheets that are 500 thread count and they are by far softer than these. I'm hoping with more washes, the sheets will become softer."
2,Not what it seems,I really like the sheets except they are not what I ordered. I ordered Sage green and a sand/tan came. The ones that are shown are plain and silky the ones that came have slightly lighter stripes. I have a set of 800 thread count and they are much nicer than these.
4,Sheets are great!,"I read all the reviews to these sheets AFTER I purchased the sheets and so was extremely skeptical when I received the sheets. The sheets ARE heavy. VERY heavy. I didn't notice a funny smell as other reviewers noted. BUT - I DID throw them immediately in the washer. I washed them 5 times. And then I was disappointed that the sheets were so 'crinkly'. I put them up. A few weeks ago, I needed another pair of sheets in a pinch and so put them on the bed. These sheets are SO smooth. I really like them. I have other sets that are 300-800 thread count and I really like this set the best. They do not hug my body and I don't get tangled in them when I turn around in the bed. I was skeptical when I received the set but have totally changed my mind."
5,Best Sheets Ever!!!!,"This is the second set of these sheets I have bought, and they are absolutely the most luxurious sheets I've ever slept on! They are very thick and sturdy, and will probably last a lifetime, and yet I find them very soft, with a slight satiny sheen. They've become even more soft and comfortable with every wash. I've recommended them to several of my friends, and have have heard nothing but rave reviews. In my opinion, you can't beat the price, and you won't go wrong with these sheets."
2,Sheets not as soft and silky as advertised.,I have several sets of 1200 count sheet sets. This is by far the worst. I have washed them several times and they still feel like sand paper. Scratchy!!!They are not silky or smooth...they are supposed to be sateen and they are not like any other santeen sheets that I have ever felt.*****update 1/26/06*****I now have several more washings on these sheets and they are starting to come around....still not 5 or even 4 starts...I would give them 3 stars or 3.5 for the value price.Buyer beware.
1,Felt like canvas,"These sheets are very heavy and stiff - they feel a lot like canvas. Also, they do not fit deep pockets mattress at all. I returned mine"
2,"Not what you would expect, and not $600 worth of sheets for sure.","Out of the packet, they are not what you would expect in terms of softness. Maybe they need to go through the washing machine a few times but i've felt softer sheets at much lower thread counts.The sheets are heavy and thick. They look like they will last a long time. They have a different feel/texture on each side. One side looks silky and has a shine to it, the other is more flat.Would i buy these again? No, not at this price ($100). I'd rather pick up the sheets at sams club for less money (made of egyptian cotton - for about $60) .I should say i have not slept under these sheets yet, but i doubt it will change my mind."
1,Neither soft nor silky,1200TC sheets are very soft. These sheets are not as advertised and I would never buy them again. As a matter of fact if I can return them I will.
4,King Sateen Sheets 1200 count,"Appear to be very high quality.1,200 count thread is stiffer and heavier than we expected.Hopefully after a few more washings the sheets will be softer and more pliable.Putting them away for the summer but will definitely be used next winter."
4,Good for the price,"These sheets are good quality. I thought they will be more soft, unfortunately I haven't found much of a difference with other sheets other than these sheets are stronger. Good buy for the price. The color is nice a little bit pinkish, but doesn't really make a difference for me."
1,1200-Count Bottom Sheet Falling Apart !,"After appx. 5 - 6 weeks of normal wear with weekly washings, following manuf. directions,this king-size, 1200-thread count fitted bottom sheet started fraying throughout the fabric(not edge frays)and forming numerous holes. Small pin-holes began tearing into larger fist-size holes from the normally tight elastic fit.In 30+ years of housekeeping for my family of four, I've never seen a sheet do this, even with years of wear. I know little about fabric used for sheets but this 1200-thread count king-size sheet SHOULD HAVE have lasted many years. This fabric was either made with inferior or very old fabric. It was not made in the USA.Amazon packaged well and shipped timely. It was still sealed in original manufacture's packaging. Amazon did offer a $20 credit."
2,Neither soft nor silky,"When I first opened the package, the sheet set smelled like gasoline or a dry cleaner's back room. I washed it twice and got rid of the smell. However, the sheet set is neither soft nor silky. You'd think a 1200-thread-count sheet would be extremely soft but my 300-thread-count sheet feels much softer than this. I am very disappointed with this purchase."
2,fabric not on grain,"I should have known I was not going to get hotel quality sheets for under $100 for an entire set, but hope springs eternal. My first concern was I had to pull out my no longer used sewing machine to reinforce seams that were already coming undone. I notice those oh so (not) subtle traces of fabric off grain - puckers where the seamstress could not hold the fabric straight. I washed the sets only to find folding them was difficult due the the threads not meeting at right angles. Should have ordered one to check it out, but live & learn. I guess I am back to a hotel's website to get the real stuff."
3,A decent REM history,"Bowler and Dray have put together a nice history of the supergroup from their early days up until 1995 (Monster is the last album mentioned in this publication). They utilize some fairly extensive research on both well-known subjects and some rare information as well.Most of this book deals with the band's liberal ideologies and business tactics used to solidify their success throughout the years, which makes for a very interesting read. The authors do become redundant often though, and I experienced deja vu many times as they repeated information frequently. There are also some intense comparisons of future and earlier situations that prevent it from being a natural and linear history."
3,Not what I expected,"I was very disappointed with this, but gave it 3 stars because it's probably my fault for not listening to the samples or reading the description closely enough. I don't know what I was expecting when I got this, but am a Jewel fan and thought it was just different versions of her ""Serve the Ego"" single. It is, but they're dance club mixes, and I can't see why anyone would enjoy listening to this CD unless they're on the dancefloor or at a club. The tracks are all repetitive and pretty much all sound the same to me. All drum beats with her lyrics every couple of minutes.I don't want to fault the CD since I'm not a fan of dance mixes and can't judge whether this is a good one or not since I don't know what constitutes a ""good"" dance mix, but buyer beware, this CD will likely appeal more to the techno dance crowd than to Jewel fans."
1,"Jewel, Are You There?","Ummm.... This track is brilliant! Where the heck is the Junior Vasquez Earth Club Anthem Mix? I guess this is just how it is first and last and always you get shaded. The better you are the harder you get shaded. The more innovative you are the less you are acknowledged for it. Shame on whomever was responsible for the omission of Junior's remix. Sigh. Foolish, because the people who get robbed the most are the fans and music lovers who go out of their way to support artists the like by coming to amazon only to find every crap remix in the universe except the good one. Shut up Hani you had two good records and Pink Floyd wrote one of them."
1,This is not a CMOS battery.,"I paid about $15 for a $2 watch battery I could have bought at Staples or Radio Shack. This is not a CMOS battery. A CMOS battery has leads soldered to it that plug into the computer. Most customers do not have the means to do this soldering on their own, and moreover it is rather dangerous to heat batteries. I will never again buy anything over the Internet for which an image is not available."
5,Good Movie,"This movie has not much of a plot but a good message and an even better cast. I loved it. It is a made-for-t.v Disney Movie, mind you. So they weren't focused primarily on sales. It does tell you the true meaning of friendship and being true to yourself, and it doesn't hurt that Erik von Detten played the lead!"
5,Dietrich: the Lord of Discipline,"Having read Maria Riva's book on her mother along with Dietrich's own autobiography, I didn't really expect any new revelations from this book -- but I couldn't have been more wrong! Mr. Bach is to be congratulated on his fascinating and respectable work honoring Miss Dietrich and her life. What a remarkable performer and a remarkable human being. We could sure use a few more like her in today's world. This is a must read for fans of the Lady and the Legend!!"
3,Harsh digital sonics; performance is rushed,"Brahms: I find their Allegro and Intermezzo far too fast, ... decidedly rushed ... tending towards forced rather than subtle, and artificially 'intense'. There are also surprising intonation lapses. On the bright side, there are moments of genuine interest .. but I'd go with Perahia and members of the Amadeus Quartet or the Beaux Arts Trio (with Trampler) ... far better.As to sonics: I find the sonics to be unpleasantly harsh and 'digital'. This is especially pronounced compared to any decent analog LP or hi-res SACD chamber recording. Kremer's sound is always scratchy, of course ... but I am referring to the overall sonic.Packaging: Note too that this is a digipac (not in a CD jewel case), .. just hard paper cover - so don't expect it to last."
3,Entertaining read,"Although written in 1930, this paperback is still an entertaining book to read. The mystery plot of ""who-done-it"" gets a little far-fetched. The author, Max Brand, does an excellent job with the male competitive boxing mentality. The thought process of the main character, John Templar, with his growing intrigue in the female, Hong Kong, was well written also."
1,Only if you're looking for EVERYTHING George Jones recorded,"Very bad audio quality recordings from early in George's career. The only notable track is ""Heartbreak Hotel."" This was originally recorded under the name ""Thumper Jones"" and wasan attempt to cash in on the rising popularity of rock n' roll. George was so embarassed by the whole thing he didn't want his name on it."
1,I trashed mine,"This s u c k s. Its noise, and this is coming from someone who likes death metal. I challenge any of you to cd roulette: basically we spin the cd and select a song at random, and you guess the song title. You would never do it!I could maybe see someone giving this 3 stars, but 5? Have you heard bands like shadows fall, arch enemy, dimmu borgir, susperia, pantera, I could go on and on. Anyone that would give this 5 stars is either in the band, or knows the band. With all that aside, I should mention the production stinks, its very garage sounding. I also love Napalm Death and the Melvins but this is s h I t. I busted mine up and put it in the trash8/18//04 - Follow up review for the dork bashing me - I also like Unleashed, Six feet under, cradle of filth, Fear factory, Cannibal corpse, Lyzanxia, My dying bride, napalm death - enemy of the music business, gorerotted, malevolent creation, Bloodbath, Macabre, Decide................"
4,"""...Didn't see THAT coming!""","Good, But not great slasher flick with just enough twists and turns to keep you in suspense!"
2,An almost winner .....,"This movie had a great premise but fell way short. The twist in the movie was great! But the child-actor was horrible. Not as good a movie as it appeared. With just a few minor changes, it could have been a good movie."
1,Babysitter Wanted,"This is terrible! Movie, picture & sound quality and everything! It was not 5.1 surround and English subtitles didn't much. and I don't think it was twisted ending!!! Don't buy this! NO!!! Don't watch this!!!"
1,babysitter wanted,"I bought this movie expecting Gore and Horror, alas i was let down. This is a terrible movie. it plods along until the end and by then you're glad it's over, seriously i watched this move on 4x speed waiting to pause and go to regular speed. It never happened. If you value your money stay far far away from this movie. I could go on and on about how badly this movie stunk but to what avail?. Skip this one!!!"
2,"Not awful, just not my kind of film",My first impression I rated this a 1 star. This time around going in and somewhat remembering what happened it wasn't all that bad. I'm just not a fan of devil/religious movies so it's a personal preference that I didn't enjoy the film. Not to mention I like my horror films a little more on the real side so they actually scare me. With that being said there wasn't anything WRONG with this movie its just not my style.For a more in depth review please visit my horror movie/book review blog in my profile
3,Horror with a twist,This brutal slasher movie actually had a few plot twists in the last third of the film that surprised me.
1,Save your time and money,"Babysitter Wanted is your basic 'girl alone' story as Angie (an 18 year old innocent college freshman) babysits a mysterious child only to spend a half hour being spooked by strange noises and then an hour in a typical slasher movie chase and fight. There are some plot twists and Sarah Thompson does a decent job but really there's nothing really interesting or worth seeing here.The film seems to exist in its own world where college students don't own cell phones (but stalkers do), community colleges have dorms and people travel across the country to go to a community college. And there's no internet, if you want to buy a second-hand bed or a job you look at hand-written notes on a bulletin board. I can't figure out if the producers wanted this to be set in the 70s or if they just don't quite know how the world works.There are few thrills, the cover is much gorier than anything you'll see in the film.Save your time and money, you don't want this babysitter."
3,Eerie Plot Twists,"Having seen so many horror and slasher movies, there is not much that could surprise me but this one had some very interesting plot twists that I didn't see coming. Worth a look if you like this kind of movie."
3,Not the next great anime series but entertaining nonetheless,"I watched this in fansub form last year and it was interesting enough for me to actually download the entire series as it was released. However, don't expect some poignant story that will enlighten you to the workings of the universe or anything. It's just entertaining. In the first few episodes it seems that the main focus of the series is Eclair's (the main character) panties. Lots of panty shots in the first several episodes then it starts to slack off on them. The characters are likeable and the episodes are interesting enough but I wouldn't say this anime is for everyone."
3,LOVED IT,"THIS BOOK WAS A GREAT READ, I ONLY HAVE ONE BAD THING TO SAY. I DONT KNOW WHY SHE WAS TRYING TO HIDE HER PAST FROM HIM, THEN WHEN HE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT SHE WAS TRYING TO KEEP HIM AWAY FROMHER THAT'S WHAT MADE ME MAD THE ENDING IS WHAT PISSED ME OFF BUT OTHER THAN THAT I WOULD READ IT AGAIN BUT SKIP THE LAST FEW CHAPTERS.ASHLEY"
4,Page Turner,I could not put this book down. I've read all Ms. Lee's novels and enjoyed them immensely! I love that she keeps characters from the previous book coming back and I love the added twists. Keep them coming Ms. Lee.
2,AMARILLO SLIM,Broad strokes of the life of Amarillo Slim. The dialogue and detail has been left out of every Slim adventure. It would have been a great read in High School.
1,The Book That Glorifies a Pedophile,"TEXAS INDICTMENTPoker champ accused of sexual assaultLegendary poker champion Amarillo Slim has been indicted by a Texas grand jury on charges that he inappropriately touched a 12-year-old girl, authorities said Monday.Amarillo Slim, 74, whose real name is Thomas Austin Preston Jr., was indicted Friday on three felony charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child, said Sgt. Randy TenBrink of the Amarillo Police Department.TenBrink said the girl reported to her mother that Preston had ""inappropriately and sexually touched"" her on Jan. 1, March 13 and March 14. The mother reported the allegations March 25."
5,No Gamble: Great Book,"I'm a poker player. I have very high standards for anything written about my favorite hobby. And, I can't say enough about this book by America's favorite rogue. Sure he's dishonest. But what a great story. Actually there are MANY stories -- all of them compelling. I don't know if I would ever make a bet with Amarillo Slim --but I sure would like to have a beer with him. Fascinating stories all wonderfully told. Great book."
3,why does everything need a review??,"this was bought as a gift for someone else, I have no clue if it was funny, interesting, or waste of time and money, I know reviews can be helpful at times, I use them myself but how about putting in a ""this was a gift"" box we can click and be on our way??"
2,Moderately interesting bio of a Texas hustler,"He's a superb athelete, a hard worker and highly intelligent. But he's slick as he can be and contemptously refers to ""square Johns"" by which I think he means non-hustlers. He spent his Army career fixing sports events and participated in other dubious activities. The book is candid and moderately interesting but I have to admit, I wouldn't like to meet this man in person. He seems incapable of making an honest deal. Seems like he's gotta hustle everybody."
2,Booooring!,"Self promoting. Boastful. Boring. I suppose I was looking to read something more entertaining and informative. What I got was a boring book full of boastful self promotion by one of the greatest slicks around. This book is only one of his great gambles and boy was I conned. Slim, you win agin. Fold."
2,"A few nuggests of info, but basically one long commercial","I should have known better when I thought this sales book would be any different from the others. No new ideas here. At least you will find that Dan Kennedy's writing style is easy to read and often funny. Ultimately though, I felt like this was one long commercial to sign up for a subscription to Dan's ""Inner Circle"" club. Skip the book, just go to www.dankennedy.com.This book is just like one of those sales seminars that pack 15,000 people into an arena under the guise of a ""leadership"" conference and then just sell you $300 tape collections."
5,Testimonial,"This is a distillation of the best of Billie Holiday.The sound has been processed - her voice is distinct from the background players.Unless you prefer Sarah Vaughan or Ella, this is the CD for you.I tried this CD on my (black) love interest, and is WORKED! He wants me to put it in my CD-RW!!!Good music, good lyrics, good rhythm, good sound quality.I should remind that Billie Holiday and me and my friend are all from Baltimore, Maryland."
2,Disappointed in it,"I got this to use at a park as a ""booth"" for a craft fair. I set it up in my backyard ahead of time to see how difficult it would be to set-up and test it out. It went up easily with two people assembling and I was pleased with the looks. It was breezy when it was set-up, but it did alright in the breeze. However, overnight we got some rain and since the roof is flat it collected water making it too heavy and the poles bent--tent collapsed. Needless to say, it is not very sturdy in a shower. If the roof was slopped, it would have been ok.The item is worthless for what we intended because we got it for protection of products at the park event. We get showers sometimes so to have a product that fails to shed water rather than hold it on top only to collapse the tent is not useful.The gazebo looks great and would be fine for a temporary use of it in nice weather. It won't handle a wet day.Mine is junk unless I can purchase replacement poles for the ones that were all bent up."
2,Not worth the money,"JFK:Reckless Youth was not at all interesting to me. Jackie, Ethel, & Joan: The Women of Camelot portrayed those three ladies unlike any way I had ever seen them portrayed in any of the movies I had ever watched. Ethel was portrayed as uneducated, unsophisticated, rude, and very power hungry. Joan was depicted as a very weak woman without a mind of her own, and the portrayal of Jackie was absurd. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on them."
5,You'll fall for this one!,"Absolutely lovely! I found this book great in the classroom for identifying leaves with older children, but also top-notch for sharing with my little boy in kindergarten. I have been collecting books about leaves and autumn for a long time, and this is definitely one of the best ones out there. Beautiful photography, generous information and straightforward format makes this a very pleasing addition to any children's nonfiction shelf, plus a great one to take on a walk through a park on an autumn afternoon! Check out the author's other terrific book, Thunder on the Plains, another winner! Keep up the great work, Mr. Robbins...looking forward to your next release!"
4,SQL Developers's Guide is usable & comprehensive,The book contains a nice balance of guidelines and tips coupled w commonly used reference material. A nice to have close by when developing w MS SQL. Good for DBA and programmer/ developer.
2,mighty joe young mighty man,very unhappy with this cd.. if the sample you can listen to on your web site was the start of the song turningpoint i would never have ordered it......
3,no service,"Mathsoft does not appear to 'do' service on this, or any, of its products. This is 5 plus stars nice software but if something goes 'bad' your out of luck.n//"
1,Out of date. Move on to the next book.,Unfortunately the version of JSF this was written against was using a different naming standard for the taglibs and there are a few other concepts that have changed. Wish I would've bought a different book.
3,JavaServer Faces Programming,"Those wanting to work with the final JSF 1.0 release should wait for a revised version of the book and then go out and buy it as soon as it is available. This book covers the JSF EA4 release and much has changed since then. The author has a clear writing style and does a good job providing a background for JSF (especially the chapter on how the Faces servlet works).A previous reader mentioned that they received updates to the code for the JSF 1.0 beta release, but the changes to tag names alone between the beta release and JSF 1.0 final mean lots of editing to get the example code to work.I am looking forward to a revised version of the book updated to the JSF 1.0 release."
1,Do not buy this book now.,"I was suckered into buying this book, as there was no other book on JSF in the store. As the JSF specs have changed considerably, this book is OUTDATED.But that is not the reason for the rating. The author rehashes the old JSF docs available from Sun in addition to tons of useless code. This is probably the worst part as ALL the examples are TOY (hello world) kind of applications, which gives the impression that the author himself does not quite understand the technology."
5,Good informative book,full of informataion for the beginner as well as a reference book. Mine has sticky note books marks all over the place. I keep in handy for those process questions.
2,Where was the hero?,"I was excited about the premise of this book and found the dichotomy of Charlotte's flighty socialite side and her serious espionage side to be very interesting. The conclusion of the Rose Hunter conflict was satisfying and the villain fairly intriguing, but I thought I was reading a ROMANCE. The hero's thoughts on ANY matter (most especially those concerning Charlotte) don't appear until almost halfway through the book, and even then they were only a handful of paragraphs.For me, one of the most crucial parts of a romance novel is seeing the romance from BOTH sides. ""My Surrender"" was almost completely one sided, and I felt like the hero had the potential to be so much more."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,I loved Brockway's Rose Hunter Triology. While I thought My Pleasure was the best...I was wrong...Brockway left the best for last. Readers will love this final installment. I instantly liked Charlotte and fell hard for Dand! I also like the return of all the members of the Brotherhood.
2,disappointment,"If you are a hardcore fan of Xzibit, please do not buy this album unless you have an extra 15 bucks to spend. The same thing that happend to the The Alkaholics when they changed their names to The Liks happened to Xzibit in his new album, they both went pop. Unless you are a fan of Ja Rule and other fake, wannabe mobsters, I can not reccomend this album for you. If you are not fan of ...-rap I recommend you buy a Del CD or one of Xzibit's better CD's like At the Speed of Life or 40 Days And 40 Nights."
4,X is back!,"The album itself was mostly good. The reason I rated it 4 stars is because it wasn't as good as his previous albums. The best song in my opinion was ""My Name"" (w/Eminem, Nate Dogg). Em also did the beats for this song. The song is off the hook. Other tracks that I enjoyed were ""Multiply"" (w/Nate Dogg), ""Symphony In X Major"" (w/Dr. Dre), ""BK 2 LA"" (w/M.O.P.) and ""Loosen Your Mind"" (w/Dre, Snoop). X could've done better in my opinion. The song with Eminem is just amazing and really bangin'. I think it is worth buying this album and if this was his first album, I would've given him a 5 but since I know what he is capable of I didn't. Lyrically the album was great. They were some whack beats on the album, but the ones that Dre and Em did, they were really tight. So I think it's worth buying this album."
3,Average,"Very average album. Release Date, My Name, The Gambler, and BK to LA are the only songs that I can bump more than a couple times. After hearing X's first two albums, I have to wonder what he was thinking when he released Restless and this album. They're not bad, they're just incredibly average after 2 classic albums.By the way, DR. DRE DID NOT PRODUCE MULTIPLY. Denaun did. Check the booklet."
3,Not that good ...,"I was expecting another great Xzibit album, but this one disappointed me. Just 3 tracks out of 16 are tight: #3 Multiply feat Nate Dogg, #6 Harder feat The Golden State Project and #9 Losin Your Mind feat Snoop Dogg.Other 3 tracks are just ok to listen to: #2 Symphony in X Major feat Dr.Dre, #8 Chock Me, Spank Me (Pull My Hair) and #11 My Name feat Eminem and Nate Dogg.The rest [is bad]!"
4,"OK, buy Restless is better","I enjoyed the Restless CD better because it had better beats. Xzibit is still up with his lyrics and one of the best lyricists on the coast. ""Man vs Machine"" took a while for it to grow on me. The song ""Release Date"" gets you pumped up for the album. ""Symphony in X Major"" has a nice beat from Rick Rok and dope verses from X & Dre. Next is the dope crusin' track ""Multiply"". Songs get boring until we get to ""Losin' My Mind"". Too bad Snoop doesn't really rap on it. ""BK to LA"" is one of my favorie tracks on the CD. I love M.O.P., they steal the show on all their guest appearances. ""What's My Name"" is dope also. Poor Jermaine. Everything else is aiight. I'm still satisfied with the album but X could of came out better. Peace!"
4,X's is back,"This CD is okay but other previos CD'S are better but still this CD is cool.These Are the best song this cd has Multiply,Heart of man,Losin your mind,BK to La,My name,and missun'u. so I bought this CD for 13.99.good jove X."
2,"Getting worse, not better","After the unevenness of Xzibit's last album, I was hoping/expecting better things from ""Man vs Machine."" I'm starting to wonder if Xzibit and Dr. Dre just can't adapt to one another's styles. It almost sounds like a collection of tracks that were cut from the last album - Xzibit's rhymes are almost as flat as the beats. Xzibit's voice is actually somewhat timid, certainly not the growl from before. It's just such an average release from an assembly of above-average talent, that the overall feeling is one of frustration - why isn't this better? The only bright spots on the album are when Eminem and Snoop pick up the mic on guest spots.Bottom line: skip this one and pick up Snoop's ""Paid tha Cost"" instead. You won't be disappointed."
4,Not Bad,The songs on this CD aren't bad but they're just not that noticeable. Most of them sound the same and the lyrics are quite bland.
4,"Good, but not what I was expecting","After hearing Multiply on the radio, I figured Man vs. Machine would be better than it was. While the cd was good, it just seemed to deviate from the Xzibit formula that he had used on his past recordings. I like some of the new stuff that he tried, including Heart of Man, but I thought Choke Me Spank Me was a needless track. Unfortunately I bought it at the record store here in Canada, and the Canadian version only goes to the 16th song, and I miss out on the song by Premier, which I was looking forward to. Overall, I think this is a decent cd, better than many out there, but it just didn't live up to the high expectations I had for it."
5,Great collection,"I have owned this ""best of"" collection for a couple of years now, and never grow weary of listening to both discs. As previous reviewers have noted, the ""Hidden Harvest"" CD is truly outstanding and worth the price of admission on its own. For those looking for a great introduction to Mary Black's artistry and wonderful voice, this is the ticket. Highest recommendation."
3,Better to have left it alone,"As a ""Best Of"" album this is, overall, a worthy effort.So why only three stars, you ask?I answer: ""Song for Ireland""My first experience with Mary Black was ""Song for Ireland"" on the Putyamo ""Women of the World Celtic"" album and I was hooked -it remains one of my favorite songs of all time.And it was HORRIFICALLY OVERDONE on this album. I tried, I really tried, but couldn't even force myself the entire way through it.A word of advice: If you ever wake up and find yourself a famous and widely-loved recording artist, try to bear in mind that your most-loved songs are most-loved because of the way you've recorded them.....and don't change them for a ""Best Of"" album - it's just counter-intuitive."
2,The best of Mary Black?,"I have all of Mary Blacks music available on compact disc. This album was my latest choice and it was indeed not the best of Mary Black in my opinion. Her rendition of ""Who knows where the time goes"" lacked the hauntingness of the original Judy Collins version.I didn't care much for her choice of songs for a ""best of"" album.I have put it back on my bookshelf. This album has none of the beauty of ""Circus"". I regret buying it and will be more cautious in the future."
1,Shovelware,"Err... they just printed it out. You can go to ...(the website)and get the latest revision (currently, Candidate Recommendation, must more recent than what's here) for free. Use a printer. Or just look at it on screen. Hey, for ...(this kind of money), you've got a nice down payment on the printer."
1,Price too high,"This is not a prepack of 10. You only receive one of the books not 10 for $10.00. Way too much to pay for this book. The ""10 Prepack"" is very deceiving and should be removed. The book itself is an excellent book but you can purchase it for a cheaper price at any local bookstore."
5,Please Get This Show onto DVD ASAP,I cannot believe this show is still not out on DVD. I would buy the seasons without a second thought. So few television shows leave such an impact on it's viewers as China Beach did. It's definitley one of the best shows ever made and deserves a chance to live again.
5,HURRAY! IT'S ABOUT TIME!,"It's here(almost)! They have finally done it. The complete series will be released April 15. Go to ChinaBeachonDVD.com to order now and it will ship between April 15 - April 19, 2013. It's about time!"
5,China Beach,"China Beach is Viet Nam's MASH and should be released in a box set or by seasons for all of us to watch over and over again. Please don't let those of the Viet Nam era seem less important than others yet again.We have MASH on DVD. We have various WWII series on DVD like Hogan's Heroes, so isn't it time to show the same respect for those of the Viet Nam era?China Beach was an excellent program and deserves to be seen."
5,LOVE THIS SERIES!!!!,"I Love this series! My mom recorded it when it was a on TV. After school my mom and I would watch it. I grew up watching this and love it!!!! I have a family member that is a Vietnam Veteran and he loves this series too, mostly because its pretty accurate with certain things. I REALLY want this series to come out on DVD, as well as several of my family members do too!"
5,Revisiting the Past Reveals the Present,"War is never pleasant no matter where it is. After 10 years at war, it is time for the US citizens to be reminded of real war: its effects and life in the field.This show should have been out long ago. I am just glad they are finally making it available."
5,One of the best TV dramas ever produced.,"I was just a kid when the original series of China Beach aired, but luckily during college I managed to see almost the entire series on reruns. I remember rushing home every afternoon so as not to miss a single episode. I have to say, I think this is one of the most revitting TV dramas ever produced. With an amazing cast like Dana Delany playing the troubled McMurphy and Marg Helgenberger as the cold-hearted KC, it was a bitter sweet every time. What a statement about the atrocities of war and the bonds that can be created between human beings during times of crisis. Needless to say, I would love to have the entire series on DVD!"
5,71st Evac Hosp. Pleiku VietNam,"I served as a Medic, at the 71st Evac Hosp from 69 to 70.Diane Evans is the Real Nurse. Dana did a great job.The T.V. show, helped me ""come home""You know, the show was based on what went on at the 71st Evac, not China Beach..... I didn't know that till later on. We, 71st Evac personal, Had a reunion in Salt Lake City. It was 35 years. 44 of us. It was so awesome. I have to say, CHINA BEACHis a very special T.V. show... SO REAL."
5,China Beach,Isn't it about time the China Beach series became available.... I posted the opening u-tube video a while back on FB and people went nuts. Looks to me like there is a lot of profit that could be made if this were finally available. Wait to long and no one will remember. I'll buy the set in a heart beat.
5,Fantastic show -- should have run for a decade,Adding myself to the chorus of those with fond memories of this remarkable drama. Don't know why I thought of this show today but I went to Amazon looking for the DVDs and was surprised to find them not available.
5,And still no China Beach on DVD,"Paging down the list of television shows on DVD, it floors me that a horrific show like ""Too Close For Comfort"" is on DVD but China Beach is nowhere to be found.Are you telling me more people are buying ""Too Close..."", ""Punky Brewster"" and ""ALF""?? If so, it's shameful.I hope some day someone will realize how many people treasure China Beach and would give anything to own the show on DVD."
5,China Beach,"China Beach was one of the best drama series ever put on a TV network. The writing was very good to excellent, the acting was first rate and the attention to detail of uniforms, firearms and equipment was remarkable. The studio wouldn't even have to advertise the DVD series to make a lot of money."
5,Best TV drama,Shame on whomever is responsible for this show not being made available to so many devoted followers. I would like it from episode 1 to the very last one. Could you give us a reason as to why you are not making this available? Kindly reply. Thank you.
5,Fantastic!!,"This documentary contains some of the best evidence the guys have ever recorded. They get good stuff all the time, but not like bricks being thrown across the room. But this was a great introductory to their regular show. Definitely a fan."
5,Amazing,Being a fan of this show I loved this documentary. It shows just how far the boys have come and why they do what they do. My mother who is not an avid watcher still enjoyed this documentary.
5,Great price for a gift,"I manage a website devoted to TV viewers, called The Blog Friendly Zone. From time to time we run contests an this year we ran one for Halloween. It was a creative use of media/pumpkin carving contest. For the prize we gave this DVD. I ordered two and two were awarded. The recipients were thrilled, both said the DVD was great. It was such a good price it didn't hurt my pocket book either. I pay for the prizes out of my own funds as the administrator of the site. I recommend this DVD for anyone interested in the real ghost investigators of the world!"
1,Dumb,I thought it was so boring. Never buy another one. I love the Hauntings series. This was stupid. It seemed like they were working real hard to make this movie.
2,Just not as good as the show,I really like ths show and cant wait to buy the next season but this is just not as good. we didnt even finish watching it.
5,The start of an Awesome Series!!!!,My daughter got us to start watching the Travel Channel TV series and my wife and I have been hooked on it ever since. We have always wondered about their first investigations at the Washoe Club and Goldfield Hotel. Its great to finally be able to see these investigations!
1,worked well at first but did not last,"Worked well, very quiet, reasonably accurate humidistat, space-efficient design holds a lot of water in a small footprint. I would give it four or five stars if it lasted more than one and a half seasons (I need a humidifier for 2-3 winter months where I live). It started leaking out of the base somewhere so I would find puddles on top of my dresser where I kept the unit. Completely unacceptable at this price range."
5,Great Humidifier,"Not sure why some people don't like this humidifier. We bought it and love it and it works great. We rarely have to refill the water tank, it's super quiet when it runs and I like that it shows you the humidity level in your room. This is the easiest humidifier I've used. My favorite feature is that mold and yucky stuff doesn't grow in the water tank. My kids like the nightlight feature too."
1,I haved try 4 units.,"And I haved return the 4, none of them have work well for different problems, to much noise, the screen died, no steam coming out and too much steam coming out.After 8 months, I finally give up I'm buying another brand possibly the AOS 2055D, I'm tired and I want something that work."
1,"Came broken, manufacturer did nothing","My unit produced no heat in the heated mode, and always registers the room humidity at 35%. Germ stated that this unit is not defective and would not exchange it under the warranty.Otherwise, it certainly humidifies, using up its tank in one to two days depending on spray flow mode. However, for the price, the H-3000 is certainly not worth it."
1,2nd one broken,"To tell the truth, i liked it when it worked. After just a few uses the red light started blinking, indicating the need to refill. At that point, nothing else would happen - full or empty. Above all, it would blink even when the humidifier was turned off but plugged in. I exchanged, and the same issue occurred shortly after. Waste of money."
2,WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED???,I do not recommend this cd to anyone that is a fan of Jazz June. After listening to it I have lost some respect for them. Now if you want a good example of Prime Jazz June material. Then check out The Medicine.
5,Classic German Metal From the 80's,This is a great example of how metal evolved differently overseas as opposed to the US brand of 80's metal. It has a good mix of all the elements that make metal an interesting form of music. Great guitar work -- but nothing like the all-out shredder guitarists that were so common at the time. The vocals weren't overly polished nor did they reach the realm of death metal. Solid rhythms from the bassist and drummer. Everything in proportion to make the CD a great listen. This band didn't buy into all of the stereotypes and that has kept this album from seeming too dated.
5,Awesome product!,Can't believe this was discontinued. I love this product and will keep using it as long as I can find more online! Goes on smooth and does not sink into lines on face. Covers great! I don't have the best skin but this makes me look like I do!
1,The worst customer service I have ever had,"The product (foundation) was defective (I have used this before) and the supplier, American Beauty would not give me refund because they said it was opened (how are you supposed to tell if it is defective without using it???) Then they told me I should have known it was defective because there was makeup on the bottle (which there wasn't when I sent it back.) Even after arguing how illogical these statements were, they then deleted the email address so they couldn't take my emails anymore. Watch out if you want to return something to American Beauty!!!!! Thankfully Amazon returned my money with their A to Z guarantee. Thank you Amazon :)"
5,vital radiance,I love this makeup! It works well on mature skin. I was disappointed that I could no longer by it in the stores but happy to still be able to have access to it online.
2,I cant believe the other reviews are so great,Not the great film youd think from the cover. I've got two words- dont bother. It's mildly funny at times but it's very easy to lose interest. If it's in the 50cent section and you really dotn have anything to do. then yeah why not. but If you're trying to impress a party- stick with Harold and Kumar
4,Much better then I thought it would be,We rented this movie looking for some stupid comedy but this was really fun. Kept us into it the whole time and a generally funny movie. Definitely worth renting.
1,Great if it worked,The promise of the software was so much more than it delivered. We have had similar problems with the software crashing the computer almost every time we attempt to use it. The sound works only occasionally and not at all for languages like Icelandic and Czech. Switching from one language to another almost always crashed the computer and most times we were unable to even get one language to switch from one activity to another. We bought the program because we have young children who are gifted in languages and naturally curious about and this seemed to be the perfect resource for them to explore many different languages on a superficial level until they found one they were interested in studying. The program proved so frustrating to use that we all gave up on it.
2,Loss models,A required book as part of the SOA's syllabus. The authors has taken this for granted and and proceeded to assemble pages and pages of formulas with some awful explanations for how the formulas came about. The focus is more on rote learning and getting you through the exams rather than illuminating the ideas behind the contents.
1,Worst text book ever,"I have used this book for two classes now during my time at college, and it is by far the worst textbook I have ever held in my hands. I learned nothing from it. worthless."
2,"Started reading this, bought a manual instead","I bought this for a SOA exam. I studied for P, FM, MLC, and MFE by reading the textbooks, and then drilling myself with problems. Not with this exam. Once I started reading this, I was pretty sure I would need a manual instead."
5,Extremely Impressed Native Texan,My dad (a reviewer of this book too) and stepmother showed my husband and I their cookbook. I wasn't really interested in it but my husband was drooling over the recipes. We finally decided to order it and we have been trying all kinds of recipes and 90% of what we tried we love. We use it all the time for parties and dinners.
3,Not what I expected,"While this cookbook may be a good one for many people, it wasn't what I was hoping for. I am always on the quest for authentic ethnic recipes, and this didn't deliver in that department."
5,Outstanding Beef Recipes,"This book is a very interesting read. Mr. Perini writes about local ranching and cowboy history and explains the origins of the recipes. I have tried many of the recipes and have yet to be disappointed. He has a great ""feel"" for bringing out the best flavor in the beef. I highly recommend this book and have purchased it as a gift for others."
5,Not Just a Cookbook,"10 days ago my wife and I were in Abilene and our host, Aaron Waldrop, took us to eat at Tom Perini's Steakhouse. Since this isn't a restaurant review, I won't tell you about the food except the bread pudding. I don't like it very much so I decided to share some with my wife. Bad mistake. It's hard to describe in words. Aaron bought Tom's book for my wife. Five days ago, we had a BBQ on the opening day of dove season (Sept. 1). We used Tom's recipe for potato salad and his rubs for the ribs and brisket. We are still getting phone calls and emails about the food. One more thing: this is a great book to just sit down and read. As others have said, the photography is great and the stories are informative, humorous and historical. This is not just a cookbook. Man, I can't wait to get some more of that bread puddin'."
3,Good information but very basic,"The information in this DVD is well presented and it address's safety issues to be aware of. The instruction on clipping is very basic and leaves one wondering how to blend out the cuts to make it not look so choppy. Like I said it is very basic and instruction is on the # 10 blade and #7 blade more then anything else. Some basic bathing, and nail grinding is given as well. It seems this is more geared to sell Oster products then to given instruction."
3,So So,"Unfortunately I keep expecting something from Jimmy like 'Wild Night Out' and 'Switching Gears' again disappoints. The album is uneven, envoking styles from cajun to Roy Buchanan to Hendrix to Joe Louis Walker and his own songs. His mastery of the guitar is not in question, just his choice of songs. Even so, there are some highlights, mostly which revolve around his playing. 'It's my own fault' with Lonnie Brooks, 'Roy's Blues' and 'Gin in the Morning' are the most memorable."
5,Rockin Christian dance music,"A really amazing collection of remixes. It will have you worshiping Jesus with all your heart. My personal favorites: ""Look What You've Done"" by Tree63 and ""All my Life"" by Parachute Band.Buy with confidence, you won't be disappointed. I also highly recommend Club J - Praise Jams Vol 1."
1,Misrepresented CD AMAZON Does Not Honor A-Z Gurantee Beyond 5 Claims,"I purchased this from a Market Place vendor and received a completely different (and damaged) item. Instead of Three CD's there was only one CD which was nothing like any of the three listed for this set. The vendor never replied after four attempted contacts via Amazon. I then attempted to file an A-Z Claim and was notified by Amazon that since I had reached my Life-Time Limit of ONLY Five Claims, they would not reimburse me. I have been an AMAZON customer for over 12 years, purchased hundreds of items, spending thousands of dollars, and now I find that I certainly am not appreciated. I have learned not to deal with AMAZON in the future and I suggest others consider any future purchases as well. After all, after 5 claims, AMAZON does not care how many times their Market Place vendors take advantage of their customers . . ."
1,Miniature Letterbox of the Pilot,"This review is for the DVD production, NOT the series itself!I hate idiot morons that do not know how to properly produce a DVD of older (1.33:1) shows for display on modern (16:9 or better) TV's. While the box states ""Letterboxed or 16:9 Anamorphic"", the ""Letterboxed"" refers to the pilot; the remaining episodes are 16:9. But did the morons letter box the show to display the typical way with bars on the sides? NO! It is setup so that it uses less than 50% of the screen, a small box with black bars on both the top AND sides.Not surprising from the same idiots who cut material to make show fit a time slot, then leave them out of the DVD. Maybe they pay royalties by the minute?"
1,Thanks for the Warning,"I too am a big fan of this series and want to thank the reviewers who have alerted us to the fact that the US version has been chopped up to fit the 90 minute ""Mystery"" time slot. My low rating is for selling us an edited version of ""Lewis"", not for the progam itself which I love. I was planning to buy the US version of the series until I read these reviews. Another reviewer recommended that ""Lewis"" fans email ""PBS feedback"" at[...] about this issue and I did. They responded immediately and indicated the situation was out of their control. Apparently they are hearing from other fans who are displeased with PBS for airing edited programming.Series 1-3, including the pilot, is available at AmazonUK for approximately $44.00. I too will be buying it there. The savings will almost cover the cost of a region free dvd player. I would encourage other fans to submit their input to PBS too. If they hear from enough ""contributors"" maybe future progamming will be spared."
3,Get the UK region 2 version - it's worth 5 stars and is cheaper,"If you liked Morse you'll like Lewis.Do yourself a favor and get the UK region 2 version from amazon.co.uk. Your amazon.com userid and password will work perfectly well. The US version is hacked about by PBS, whereas the UK version is the full untouched longer episodes. If you get the UK series 1-3 plus pilot package it is currently cheaper than in the US.Worried about not having a multi-region dvd player? Get yourself a Philips 5990 dvd player (on Amazon.com for about $40)Philips DVP5990/F7 DVD Player with 1080p HDMI Upconversion and DivX. Go into setup>preferences and press 138931 on your remote > press 'up' arrow to select '0' and hit setup again to exit and you are now the proud owner of a multi-region dvd player.The UK version is worth 5 stars.Series 4 of Lewis will be out in the UK soon."
5,Great Show,What can i say I just love mysteries and the British mysteries are some of the best i have ever seen. the who don it are the best and the do it goooooood
5,Morse lives on in Lewis series,"Having been an Inspector Morse fan for years, am glad to see the Morse legacy live on through Inspector Lewis. Will continue to collect DVDs of this series."
3,Inspector Lewis Pilot & Seies 1 (almost),"It's a great followup to the Morse series, but with the same defect. The running time is reduced from the BBC set to the Masterpiece Mystery format. When I buy a DVD, I expect more content, not less."
3,Straightforward Entertainment,"The British know how to produce straightforward solid entertainment, without the contrived element of celebrity getting in the way. This Inspector Lewis premiere has all the necessary elements (murder, changing alliances, a boss that doesn't get it) for an enjoyable story."
1,Horrible!!!,"Awful movie. Awful script. Awful acting. Awful actors. Awful camera work. Awful sound. Don't waste your precious time on this horrible movie. I've seen more talent in a cheerios box. The acting was wooden and unbelievable. The supposedly hot girl is completely unattractive and her best friend is just as unlikable.. and even less attractive. The main male actor was ridiculous. I hated this movie and the people leaving planted reviews should be ashamed of themselves. Overall, this was very amateurish. Don't waste your money."
4,Indie spirit at its best,"This movie has everything you would expect from an indie comedy: an interesting premise, good acting and irreverence."
3,A look at anti-semitism,"This is a well-researched work that deals with Hollywood and issues of Jewish control - and how those issues have influenced politics and popular culture. The writing is nothing spectacular - a tone that was a bit livelier would certainly not have hurt the book's academic credibility - but Carr compensates by offering a mountain of research. It's amazing to see what kinds of offensive things that members of the government and famous citizens (Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh) got away with saying only 60-70 years ago. All in all, this is a useful book on an important subject."
4,nice way to personalize,"I loved the idea of developing a font based on my own handwriting. It's a nice product to have for personalizing e-mail, letterhead and general word processing creations. My major criticism was the less than user-friendly instructions. It would have been helpful to know to use a marker instead of a ball point pen to create the font. It also took a good deal of time to figure out how and what to edit on the fonts. You do receive adequate instructions to get you started. Overall, it is a good product and I would recommend the purchase."
4,A must-read for working poets,"Sam Hamill opens the door to the life behind the poetry with his essays and reviews. He never shrinks from stating plainly his feelings about the profession of poetry, as opposed to those who use poetry as a form of self-help. While some carp about Hamill's indulgence with the insider's game of poetry, these are useful and honest essays from a poetry insider who still lives in the real world; a non-academic who is a true scholar, and ultimately, a lover of the poetic tongue."
5,A gift to Music,"The series ""Young People's Concert"", produced and presented by Leonard Bernstein is a great gift to to music itself, and to the world. Here is the Century's most Unique Musician and Teacher, explaining so beautifully and so clearly the joy of music in a way that grasps the attention of all. Every aspect of music is so cleverly presented that everyone, regardless of age, culture or educational background will enjoy and understand. There can be no better way to present music to the world. This video is a MUST see for all families, and it's amazing that EVERY school does not present these gems to all their students.-- Young people would be much better for seeing this. Really, this is great viewing for all the family. A MUST SEE.OVER & OVER AGAIN.Geoffrey Shields. Kingston, Jamaica (W I)."
5,Another great album by an under-appreciated blues master,"This album (along with Montoya's two others) remains the most played in my collection. It's polished, emtional and exciting. The only question I have is: ""When is the next one coming, Coco.....it's been two years man!"""
3,Give Me The Iceman,"Coco Montoya is an engaging live performer, but this CD suffers from the Michael Bolton Syndrome, with Montoya seemingly on the verge of a nervous breakdown on nearly every track, even when shrieking Rocky Balboa-type inanities--""We gotta do what we gotta do!"" Add to his desperate vocals his overplayed, piercing Fender Strat and it's an exhausting piece of work blaring out of your speakers. As B.B. King has proved, sometimes virtuosity is knowing when NOT to play. Montoya's songwriting, which dominates the CD, is also quite mediocre. You have to wait for the last song, Sending Me Angels, to have a tune you can actually distinquish, and Delbert McClinton did a better version of the song. I disagree with reviewers who state Montoya has surpassed his mentor, the great Albert Collins. Montoya, with this CD, is still only the Iceman's sideman and opening act."
5,Vivid New York,This CD features really amazing recordings from all around the big apple. Everything from an argument in the subway to the fourth of July. Brilliant!
5,My cologne,I have worn Ciara for over 40yrs........this is a fav of mine.i do wear others but I always come back to this
1,Stays Shiny,I have been looking for stainless flatware that keeps its shine after running through the dishwasher and this is it. It is also just the right size and weight--heavy enough to be classy but not hard to hold and it looks beautiful on the table as well.
4,Ancient records and the structure of Genesis: A case for literary unity,"Book arrived in good condition. Book was overpriced because it is out-of-print, but I'm still happy with the book."
3,Partially Satisfied,"This video breaks the steps down, which is great! But I was hoping for a better variety of songs they choreographed."
2,Didn't work on my mac.,"I thought I had read all of the compatable os systems for mac prior to the purchase, but maybe I missed somthing. When I tried to load it to my mac minni, I kept getting msg. Software not compatable. So I realy can't say if it works or not. Im sure it does , just not on my system."
1,Don't buy,"Don't buy. First one was cracked. Second one was cracked. Appears to be manufacturing defects. Amazon quickly replaced first and issued credit on second one. Amazon, for my inconvenience, issued an additional $20 store credit. Amazon-good. Manufactuer-bad."
4,"Great, but re-season it.","This is a fantastic wok. It has a round bottom on the inside and a flat bottom on the outside so it fits on a flattop stove with no problems. It's the closest your gonna get to a traditional thin-steel wok on this kind of stove. HOWEVER, the fist time I heated this thing up it emitted some seriously noxious fumes. A the *least* you need to throughly wash the thing (with soap) before you use it. A better option would be to totally re-season it. The factory seasoning can be removed by running it through your oven's self-cleaning cycle. This will turn the existing seasoning to ash which you can easily wash off."
1,Poor quality Chinese cast iron - cracked,Two large cracks even before use. Check carefully while washing up for the first time as the shipping coating hides the cracks. The cracks may or may not run. Cast iron is brittle. Cracking of cast iron is not that uncommon but in general it indicates poor quality materials and/or poor production procedures during the cooling and mold removal process. The Chinese cast iron can be excellent but when the importer takes bids for the absolute lowest price ( ie the Walmart syndrome ) this is what you get. Look at old cast iron skillets made in the USA and you will see that the grain and pores in that cast iron is much finer indicating better quality materials and production.
2,It is heavy...really...,"It actually has a weight of 13lb, rather than the ""8lb"" from product description of amazon. It is really heavy if you want to use it as a stir-frying wok. I don't event try to use it when I realize it is that heavy..."
2,Home Cook,"Probibly would have loved it if they had been able to get it to me in one piece! Ordered it twice, the second time it arrived even more dammaged than the first time."
4,Very good caste iron wok,"We prepare various chicken dishes in this, mostly to make fried food items, including chilly chicken. I recommend this product."
5,Heavy Wok,"According to the advertised description of this cast iron wok, it weighs 11 lbs. I didn't realize how heavy 11 lbs. would be until I received this wok! If the weight of the wok is not an issue, then I would recommend it for several reasons. Not only is the price excellent, but the wok is easy to season and maintain. It heats evenly and is capable of cooking a great deal of food at once. All the cooks in my family love it!"
1,Chips,Cooked with this about 3 times now the bottom is starting to chip off. I only used a wood spoon when I cooked and used water and a soft sponge to clean it with. Sending it back and getting the one that's 10$ more.
1,Poorly made,"We have had nothing but problems with this wok! First item arrived with a crack in the base and then exchanged item appeared to be fine, until we cooked with it. When we were finished cooking, we lifted the wok from the stove and saw burnt sauce on the electric stovetop! There is a tiny HOLE in the cast iron base, causing the wok to leak!!!! We will not be wasting our time by ordering another Mr. Bar B Q product, made in Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan, China, Malaysia, Thailand and/or the Philippines. ! We will stick to Lodge Cast Iron- USA made and the best there is!"
2,Not what was advertised!,"The product description indicates a 16"" wok, however only a 14"" wok was delivered. Also, the packaging was even worse then other posters have described. The box was so battered, with no packing material, that I can't use it to ship the darn thing back and will have to pay out of pocket for a new shipping box. Amazon is offering a refund, but I still need a 16"" wok!On a possitive note, it looks like an excellent wok and has a beutiful ring when you strike it, so no cracks, but is just is not big enough for my needs."
4,Still a wok in progress,"I really like this wok, but it's going to take a while to get it to the seasoning stage I want and keep it there. It sure beats the old, thin metal wok I used for years."
5,Wonderful Wok!,"I really like this wok -it is solid and the more you use it the better it gets, like all cast iron, my friend from Taiwan wants one like it, she was impressed with how well it worked for an electric stove."
2,Another one with a crack,"Arrived w/ a crack in the side. Didn't notice it until after I seasoned it. Its made of really cheap cast iron. Spend the extra 30 or so and get a something that can take the banging around during shipping and will outlast your grandchildren. I'm returning this and getting the lodge cast iron wok.Ohh, and the oil they treat it with so it doesn't rust before purchase is really hard to scrub off. Get one that's pre-seasoned. You still need to scrub off the wax they use to pre-season then season it yourself in the oven but its not toxic. The oil on this wok is a nasty black/grey color and smells like a gas pump when you season it even after scrubbing it out multiple times before hand.At least amazon is picking up the tab for shipping this defective item back(reason for 2 stars. The product gets 0 stars). Shipping was speedy but the item was not packed well. Like everything else I order that's not a book and shrink wrapped to a cardboard ""plate""."
1,Poor quality cast iron,I ordered this cast iron wok - after seasoning per instructions it cracked on the rim. Returned it for replacement - second wok - cracked on the rim while seasoning it. Returned it - ordered the Lodge brand wok. Lodge is great - Mr Bar-B-Q very bad. My advice - pay for the good one.PS Amazon was great - immediate response on the returns and prompt processing of my credit - twice. All shipping fees paid - practically painless - no wonder their stock keeps going up.
3,Wok arrived broken...,"Wok is in itself of great quality, shape, size, make etc... However I suggest that Amazon improve their wrapping techniques, since the item arrived with a long crack all the way down one side. I have received books that were better wrapped (with airpillows etc)."
5,Mr. Bar-B-Q Cast iron wok,"Bought one of the carbon steel woks at our local kitchen gadget store and we could not get it hot enough or at least keep it hot during the process as others have pointed out. So we got the cast iron because it would sit right on the gas stove and not need the ring that kept the carbon steel wok from getting enough heat. All I can say is, we love it. Could not be happier with our purchase. Does anyone want a free carbon steel wok?"
5,Best Wok I Own,"This Wok is one of the top 5 items in my kitchen - fabulous! No problems with shipping, cleaning, or seasoning! Chow"
4,Great wok,"I read all the warnings about broken woks, but I ordered anyway. Sure enough, it arrived at my door in two big pieces. However, Amazon is run the way you wish all companies were run. In less than 15 minutes I had the thing boxed up and labeled for a free trip back to Amazon. By the end of the week, I had my new wok, in one piece. That's service!I had a devil of a time getting the factory coating off the thing. I ended up burning the heck out it in my outdoor BBQ. I highly recommend that method btw. Then I washed it thoroughly, and boiled water in it to really clean it up. Now it's on it's way to being well-seasoned.This thing is a really big chunk of cast iron and it gets HOT, which is great for stir-frying. I'd give it a five, except that it's not perfectly round on the bottom, though it's very close. But for the price, I'm very happy with it."
5,wots of wove for wok,"got this wok for our middle son, the chef. He loves it. Got one initally that had a crack in it (was prepared for that, since other reviewers said that had happened to them). Amazon sent another one even before I returned the first. It was perfect. REALLY good product. Will probably get one for myself eventually."
3,Booty Jams,"This was kind of disappointing because alot of these songs are not the originals & if you're a fan of the ole skool 80's bass music as I am you know what I mean.Over all its a OK CD,dont think I would purchase again if I could do it over though."
2,Just OK.,"I haven't heard any of Deborah Coleman's other albums but I have to say Amazon's reviewer seems to have it about right. I can't think of another woman who plays blues/rock this well (well, Jennifer Batten but that's another story) but the solos sound ""fixed"" & rehearsed like those soft & warm jazz records. If you think Robert Cray is on fire, you'll like this."
3,Not worth the $$$,"I bought the DCRHC65 after trying out the DCRHC30 thinking the larger CCD unit would make a difference in low-light conditions. But I wasn't able to see any difference.The design of this camera sux. The input / output cable ports are located in difficult spots. The tethered lens cap is ridiculous. Too heavy. Consumes battery too quickly.If you're considering this camera, compare it with the DCRHC30. The only big difference is the pixel memory and CCD size. Both do analog to digital pass-through. But the DCR-HC30 is hundreds less."
2,Had Some Flaws,"A pretty bracelet and lightweight, but there was a kink in it right out of the box and part of the stamped design was missing. It wasn't as flexible as I like."
3,pretty good Bad Seed,"Being that the author's brother guested as Bad Seeds guitarist on Lollapalooza '94, you might expect this unauthorised biography to be a whitewash. Yet a remarkably frank portrait emerges from the mouths of cohorts like Mick Harvey, Rowland Howard and engineer Tony Cohen. Gnarly drug stories come thick and fast. Like the Birthday Party gig in Zurich where the mike wasn't properly earthed so Cave got fried every time he touched metal--but was too f**ked up to notice. Or the time he shot up on the subway and then started scribbling out lyric ideas in his own blood with the needle. In all, it's a valiant attempt at nailing down this elusive crooner."
4,A Killer Bio. That Helps Explain Nick's Mindset......,"I read this book last night, and finished it all in less than two days. I was fascinated and repulsed at the same time to learn of the antics and habits of this amazing singer/writer! He was such a scum junkie, but he was so concise in what he believed. It was a thrill a minute, making me laugh, and cry at the same time at the happenings that shaped his life."
3,PainfullyDry Text Robs Cave Of The Fire Of His MadPossession,"The squalid details of Cave's adult existence seem as dark as any song or book he's written, yet Johnston renders them with all the lyrical intensity of a color-blind mute. Ah would have loved this book of 80s decadence and frantic violent genius had it not been bloated with tedious record-deal sagas & written like a stock market paper. Gawd almighty, Johnston's style isn't worthy of the word style. Somehow, through some miracle in reverse, his utter soullessness manages to make even Nick Cave's life read dull. Mah secret prayer is that Cave will write his own blasted biography so no other poor fools have to slog through this dreadful text for glimmers of the man behind the myth."
3,Good but could be better,"After reading Alton's previous works with the J.D. Stanton series I had high hopes for this book. I wasn't really let down until the end. Theologically the book felt really off even though the author tried to throw together an explanation toward the end. The main enemy, a demonic presence, is never truly explained. I felt frustrated with the lack of spiritual authority the Christian characters had. Though I know the author wasn't making a theological statement, I just get tired of seeing the Christians getting their butts handed to them.Aside from that, it is a page turner and worth a read and buy. I felt that the author should have taken another 50-75 pages to flesh somethings out but the end product is still good within itself.Check out:A Ship Possessed, Value (J. D. Stanton Mysteries)After reading this you'll understand what I mean."
3,"Exciting,tense, read,but no star for the lousy anti-climatic ending!","The Prodigy grabbed me from the beginning and took me on a fast-paced ride all the way then threw me over a cliff at the end! An exciting read,but you are left feeling that he forgot to even write an ending to this story! Waaay too many unanswered questions are left and the ending is totally unsatisfying."
4,Exciting and Worthwhile Read,"I enjoyed this book very much. The storyline and plot was very entertaining and kept my attention. One keeps hoping for the best for the mother and her son, and that they eventually realize the evil intents of those trying to capitalize on the gifts of the boy. It had an exciting ending. I am glad I read this book and have added it to my personal library. I would recommend it to any of my friends. In my opinion, it is a worthwhile read."
3,Prodigious!,"Alton Gasky enters an arena once held by none other than the ubiquitous Frank Peretti with his novel ""The Prodigy"". While Gasky covers no new ground with this well told tale, he does do it with passion, verve, and a deft hand. While I tend to shy away from any books with a religious theme, ""The Prodigy"" is a fabulous exception to my typically steadfast rule. Handling the story of six-year-old Toby, a backwoods-born, illegitimate son of an uneducated mother and abusive father with capable hands, Gasky entertains with the best of them. Though the story itself has gaping holes in the plot, and some of the events take a tremendous leap of belief for the reader, ""The Prodigy"" is still an entertaining read. Also, some of the questions posed are left unanswered in this tale...questions of faith and plausibility. Still, I would recommend this novel for anyone wanting a quick, easy, non-thinking read for a summer day~"
4,Good Fiction!,"The Prodigy is one of those books that occasionally makes you say outloud ""Yeah!"". But unfortunately has a few moments where you say, ""That's it?"" I think Alton Gansky is a great writer, but I think he needs to concentrate on the climax of his novels. He starts off his novels with a punch so strong, sometimes the endings can't live up to the previous writing.However, all that said, I think The Prodigy is an excellent story. I felt the pain and suffering of Toby's mother through-out this story. Anyone who wants to read a suspense/mystery novel written by a storyteller committed to his craft (not just after a paycheck) should purchase The Prodigy.I would also highly recommend all of Gansky's other novels. I haven't found a bad one yet.See ya next time!www.therunninggirl.com"
3,"functional, can wear corners of doors","PRODUCT: 3 stars. They work as advertised. Don't break. No problems reaching them. The twist-lock doesn't always open to full depth, making it hard to even pop on the door to begin with [especially with two of our five locks]. This also leads to wear on the corners of the door as you slide it back and forth. It's not that we're too lazy to twist; nor are our doors not flush. They just doesn't want to open the whole way.SHIPPING: 0 stars. Nothing to write about.PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: We're using them against too-intelligent-for-our-own-good cats. Instead of coming home to the poltergeist-effect, all of our closets are safe. Unless it's one of the annoying problem locks, they're very quick and easy to use. We don't find that we have to tighten them, as that the width of the lock is often adequate at keeping the doors closed. There is a /slight/ opening of the hinge, so perhaps you would have to tighten each time for kid fingers."
5,Best gift I ever received.,"I received this CD as a gift from a friend. I am not a very musical person myself, but I really enjoy listening to all kinds of music. My friend thought I would like this because I am of Irish decent. When I first listened to this CD I was blown away. I put on in the car on my way home a did not turn it off until it was over. I sat in my driveway until I had listened to every song. There are a lot of really good singers, but when you listen to Maura O'Connell she is able to pull you into the story behind the music. You feel as if you are living what she is singing. Last month in Nashville at the Bluebird Cafe I was able to see her live and to meet her after. She is as nice and sweet a person as she is a wonderful singer. I just ordered 4 more of her CDs. I will be a fan for life."
2,Disappointing,Maura needs to get away from Nashville. They've made her beautiful voice sound like every overproduced C&W girl singer. A real shame.
2,Neither Irish nor Newgrass/Bluegrass.,"I love everything she's done - till now. The songs are just ok. I don't hear the things that have made Maura stand out for me: her roots, unique styling, song selection and backup. For those who've loved the Irish influence in her ""bluegrass,"" I think it's hard to find either here. This just sounds like anybody's studio album with a huge amount of instrumentation; in fact I sometimes can't even tell it's her unique voice. Well, I still love her though!"
1,A Big Disappointment,"I love Maura's voice and so it's a great disappointment to hear that glorious instrument wasted on the bland songs and rote arrangements of ""Walls and Windows."" Especially since I was prepared by Maura herself to expect great things -- she said she had been inspired by Lucinda Williams's ""Car Wheels"" album and wanted to capture that sound. Well, she certainly did not capture the rootsy sound of ""Car Wheels."" But I wouldn't have minded, because it's her wonderful way with a song, and her great taste in selecting them that's always been her strongest suit. But the songs here are all unmemorable, some of them just plain bad, except for a 35-year-old tune by Van Morrison, and even here she's not allowed to really stretch out. I can't imagine where she sees the ""edge"" in these songs. There isn't any edge here. Hate to say it, but I'm going to tape ""Crazy Love"" and then sell this album."
5,This has to be the best embroidery book I have ever read.,"This is the most useful book I have ever encountered in the world of textiles, embroidery, stitching. All the stitches you could ever hope to use are here, clearly explained"
4,Some of the best art ever put into the pages of an IMAGE release,"Jae Lee sure knew how to drive people crazy. He was always late in the 90's (and is frequently late this decade as well) and his HELLSHOCK was notorious for lateness. The first series was decently written and expertly illustrated. The second series was canceled because Lee just couldn't meet a deadline. He was months late.This Hardcover release sort of wraps up the second mini-series with an epilogue like finish that uses some interesting art and storytelling, but it feels rushed and somewhat tacked on. No doubt that Lee had other intentions at the time.The extras at the end are quite interesting, but the retail price for this release is way out of line for such a short work. Had it been oversized (allowing you to get closer to the art) I would say pay full retail. But it is not, so try and get it at a discount."
4,Prime Clarence White,"You might think that listening to 33 guitar instrumentals straight through might be too much, but that is not the case here. Most of the tracks are short (the entire album lasts barely forty minutes). Nevertheless, the level of invention is remarkable. Roger Bush accompanies on every track but often you find yourself wondering if White really needed the help. Whatever the case, White's playing is accurate and beautifully phrased no matter what the tempo.These selections were recorded on home equipment in the early Sixties and the sound, while nothing to write home about, is more than acceptable."
5,Just awesome !!!,Clarence White was just down right AWESOME. It's amazing to here some of the songs that Tony Rice has recorded and hear the likeness and the influence Clarence had on Tony. What a great learning tool this cd would be for someone wanting to learn flatpicking. I couldn't imagine the stuff he would have come up with as he would have matured. May he rest in peace and his music live on.
3,2nd what ElvisNoir said,"I'm in pretty much complete agreement with what ElvisNoir said in his review. That is, this album is best for hard core flatpicking fans. To most folks these types of arrangements may shine best in the Kentucky Colonels album ""Appalacian Swing"" where additional instruments are present ( I have both). For those hardcore flatpicking fans I'm thinking this might be a full 5 stars, but for other bluegrass fans perhaps 3 stars....."
4,Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer Monopoly,"Bought this game for a friend of mine who loves Rudolph. She loved the game. In fact, her whole family enjoyed playing it. Said it was ""cool"""
4,rudolph monopolly,"The game it self was great, but the box had to ripes in it and I received the game one week later then promissed."
5,It's go down in history...,"As one of the best purchases I made on Amazon.com, I love Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and other Christmas classic cartoons and claymations. I bought this Monopoly version to play with my nieces (ages 6 and 4). I mostly bought it thinking we would all have fun, I hadn't considered the ""educational"" aspect, but my six-year-old niece is thinking more about adding/counting, subtracting/spending and reading the deeds of property as well as the Silver & Gold cards. My four-year-old niece is learning to count the spaces and the numbers on the dice after she rolls. The only drawback, which isn't the seller's or manufacturer's fault is that both girls fought over who got to be Santa... nobody chose Rudolph (I had picked Bumble)."
1,This product was not new,My niece expected to have a brand new doll with accessories but it was in a zip lock bag instead with no accessories I wasted my money!
1,Not a Good Deal,"These DVDs are absolutely rip offs. M-1 had some great fights, however you only see the action that was on broadcast TV. Each of these only come with 5 fights and many cut out rounds 1 and 2. The DVD's only hold about 50 minutes of action. I am a big time MMA Fan and these DVDs are just not worth it. HDNET should have bundled the fights together and made compilation DVDs"
1,tell it like it is,"i couldn't agree more with what 'music lover' said about the packaging glitch.you go 'lover',tell it like it is,fire & brimstone over the unfaithfull."
1,great music-terrible packaging,"I don't know what Columbia was thinking. This was probably the worst packaging I have ever seen. I now have 4 discs sitting uncovered on my desk waiting until I can go buy 4 jewel boxes for them. If Columbia had any heart at all, they would give us a 800 number to get so that we could get something to put them in.I love the music but I am so upset with the package, I am unable to listen to them without getting upset."
1,Awful packaging design... cut my finger!!,"This 4-CD set is issued in a lucite, hard-plastic see-through rubic-cube type shell. In trying to find the right ""door"" to slide open, I actually skint my finger trying to slide open the sharp-edged door, which all four discs are featured in a no-frills, no-artwork display case. Be careful when tossing the outer cellophane wrap, since it lists the song titles of the four discs. You're lost without it! After my fiasco with opening this sharp-edged cube, I no longer had an interest in listening to the contents. The box is designed to accommodate at least 10-12 jewel cases, but instead you get grooved slots for 4 naked CDs, and the booklet! Design-overkill, and it doesn't even fit in my wall unit cases! I guess I'll just use this piece of art crap as a conversation piece, and wear gloves when trying to open it! Although the design may attract curious kids, I wouldn't allow them to play with it."
2,"great music, stupid packaging","what ""genius"" decided to come up with this box? It literally took me a half hour to figure out how to open this up, and then the discs went flying. Fortunately, my reflexes are good so nothing was damaged, but I'm sort of afraid to mess with it. JazzTimes magazine gave it a ""thumbs down"" award, and said the box came with instructions for opening (mine had no instructions). Did Herbie himself have anything to do with this, or was it just Columbia? Isn't it enough of a problem having the money to buy this music (great as it is) without having to deal with these incredible packaging issues. A ""digi-pack"" would be far superior, and I wouldn't have to worry about disc safety, or where to put the damn thing!"
1,Count me in re: consumer backlash...,"As with other reviewers, I've wondered what the record label has been thinking when it comes to these jazz boxed sets. The Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Charlie Christian sets...all issued in ""deluxe,"" ""creative"" packaging that comes up short, shorter, or shortest in the two areas most important to me when I purchase these collections (not counting the music itself, of course): safe storage of the discs and readable, organized liner notes. Well, this latest fiasco is the last straw. I have a long-running interest in Herbie Hancock's music and was interested in this boxed set...but I will not purchase it unless/until it gets reconfigured in a user-friendly package (hint: start with jewel boxes and leave the ""innovations"" to the musicians)."
5,Incredible story!,"Awesome, awesome book. This treasure joins about three dozen other adventure books in my library and is one of only a few that I have read twice. It's honest, funny, intense and thouroughly entertaining. Thank you for sharing your story Stevie!!Greg K[...]"
5,Beautifully written and inspiring,"I am in awe over the accomplishment of Pedalling to Hawaii, not merely the challenges faced by Stevie Smith and Jason Lewis with the 360 Expedition, but the beauty of Stevie's writing. His mastery of language, human insight peppered with such an array of emotions spilling over the pages, yields such delicate and tender storytelling. It flows perfectly.I thank Stevie for the experience the book has given me. An enlightening, heart warming and inspiring read."
3,Where is it?,"I love listening to Lee Morse. Like another reviewer said, her vocals are definitely an acquired taste...to me she sometimes sounds like a 1920s Shakira with a low voice. But her low, tragic voice is POWERFUL. When she sang Moanin' Low, it was so soul-searing. She is such a great singer, though forgotten. So much better than Marion Harris, who I think also sang in a low heartyish (but Lee Morse does not really sound hearty a lot) voice, but for some reason I liked Morse better. I initially got this CD because I LOVED her version of Moanin' Low, but Moanin' Low is NOT on here! Huh? It SHOULD! Moanin' Low is the BEST sample of her singing ever, and it should've been on here. I was all like, "" Where is it?"" Great recordings, but not up to the level of her rendition of Moanin' Low."
2,The same sweater repeated throughout with slight variations,"I'm so disappointed by this book. No imagination!!! Every single sweater has a round neckline whether for the pullovers or for the two plain cardigans. Not a single v-neck, shawl collar, or square neckline at all. The shapes of every single sweater appears to be the same - square and boxy. All have the same plain, straight sleeve. The differences are in the yarn and nearly half are a rib stitch. The others are basic stockinette. If I could be so bold... please save your money and go to an on-line free pattern website for much cuter and infinitely more creative designs with instructions that are equally as clear. I give two stars because the basic shape is ok despite the fact that it is used throughout the book."
4,Love it!! What about those 4 stitches?!,"I love this book! As a fairly new knitter, I like the simple designs. However, I'm making my first project from this book, and found what I believe is a mistake. In the garter stitch side-to-side solid jacket, when dividing each side for front and back, it says to place 4 sts on a holder, then place the rest on another holder. It never does say what to do with those 4 stitches. If anyone knows, please do tell!! (BTW, I did check extensively on the pattern corrections page of the publisher, to no avail.)"
3,A good selection for reference,"I have yet to knit anything from this book of sweaters, but like to have many to choose from, when deciding what to knit next. It is a good book to have in the 'library' of the knitter."
5,The merry swan,It was funny when the trupeter swan played as the bugeler at camp kokoos.I think that people 7 and up should read this book.
4,Great Author,"E.B. White is an awesome author. Would highly recommend. This book is a classic, read when I was a child. My daughter loves it."
5,"title..... and also a cool book, one of my favorites of all time!","O.k lets get to the point..... THIS BOOK IS AWESOM READ IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! its a cool story about a trumpeter swan who cant talk so he goes to school and meets a boy and gets a trumpet...... wait?! why I'm telling you?! read it yourself and find out! (PS this book is one of the best of all time, you don't know what your missing!)"
5,What a beautiful book!,"I remember loving this book as a child, and rereading it now with my kids it does not disappoint. The adventures of Louis the mute Trumpeter Swan, his trumpet, and his friend Sam, are at the same time lovely and fascinating. They are touching and beautiful moments, but not so much so that the book seems sappy or weak. Of all the books we've read at bedtime, this is the first to get such a resounding chorus of ""Read more! Read More!"" at the end of every chapter.It is strongly suggested for children off all ages, particularly ones who might enjoy dreaming of being life long friends with a wild animal."
4,It was a great book,It was a great book. I think it was a book that would calm people down. It could be something you can read in your spartime.
2,Repaying a Debt,"Louis, a trumpeter swan, is born without the ability to trumpet. His parents are very worried about the life of a trumpeter swan without a voice. But Louis meets a young boy named Sam though whom he learns to read. Louis' father then steals a trumpet for him. Louis then must make an effort to repay his father's debt to society. Can a trumpeter swan make do with a human trumpet and find love?Fits well in the Citizenship pillar of character counts."
3,A very not bad book,I didn't really like the book it was kind of boring.It made you wanna fall asleep reading it.I give the book 3 stars.
4,The Trumpet of the Swan,"I recommend this book to any reader seeking adventure, fantasy, and fun. Aside from the fact that Louis the swan really coulkn't play the trumpet or write, it's hard to believe this book is fiction. This is because Louis' romantic feelings for the swan he loves are so realistic. The Trumpet of the Swan is about a young trumpeter swan who sets of to earn money, for his father has stealthily stolen a trumpet to help his son communicate. Louis ends up giving the people of Boston the time of their lives. I definitely think you shoulk read this book, for it is just busting with exitement."
5,One of the Best Books on Earth,"E. B. White's super book, The Trumpet of the Swan, is a story about Louis, a smart trumpeter swan. Louis was born without a voice. Find out if Louis successfully overcame his disability in his exciting life when you read The Trumpet of the Swan. I highly recommend this nicely written, funny, and superb book because it is interesting and entertaining. I learned that you can usually overcome a disability if you try hard. You should enjoy reading this great book."
3,The Trumpet of the Swan,"I purchased this book for my son who is just about to enter 5th grade. The Trumpet of the Swan was his summer reading assignment. The copy of The Trumpet of the Swan we purchased from Amazon is in good condition. And I purchased it for a very reasonable price. The story is a really delightful and entertaining story about a male and female swan that have a litter of babies and one of them ends up not being able to make any sounds. The story is about how the swan without a ""voice"" goes about getting his voice (trumpet). All in all we enjoyed reading the book and recommend the seller for anyone who wants a book in good condition and a fair price."
4,Best of E.B White!,"Great kids book! Full of humor and saddness.Once you pick it up, ya can't put it down. Occasional dull moments. I ain't not got no eb white book bestest than this here!"
1,E. B. White's Worst,"I think you should not pick this book up at the library becauseit is not such a great book. It's not such a good book because thereare no exciting bits or bits that you want to read more and more of. But, there are some good bits, like when Louis, the trumpeter swan, learns to fly. It's still not a very good book and a bit boring. It's generally about a trumpeter swan who must learn how to communicate and get money. E. B. White is a great author, but this book isn't that great. END"
5,fun-filled book for the whole family!,"Gather up mom and dad and the kids and read this wonderful piece written by E.B. White! The author of the children's book, ""Charlotte's Web"" does a wonderful job creating a full filled adventure of a young boy and his facisnation of nature. A must read for children of all ages!"
1,"I still want to see it (but with ENGLISH subtitles, please)","UNLESS YOU SPEAK DANISH OR JAPANESE, DO NOT ORDER THIS VERSION.This dvd is in DANISH with JAPANESE SUBTITLES."
2,Japanese/Danish version,"This version of ""Idiots"" notably differs from descriptions of the movie offered elsewhere. I suspect it has been heavily cut to something like a PG13 version for the Japanese market."
1,Missinformed,"It took two weeks for me to get my book, unfortunately it was not the book I wanted. I ordered the edition in Spanish, as it was offered in the web page, but I got the French edition. I contacted the people who sold me the book and they told me,""sorry, the book doesn't exist in Spanish"" but they didn't offered to get me a replacement or refund or any other option. They asked me to returned the book to my expense.I am very disappointed."
2,Cool toy for about 60 seconds...,"Works great (as advertised)... but pretty much useless for any practical purposes. The focal length is about 1 mm wide meaning that anything closer or farther than an exact specific distance is completely out of focus. If for some reason you need to inspect the pores of your face at 200x magnification, this is absolutely the ideal tool... otherwise, go for the $300 version of this product and the correct $150 lens for your particular application. But, in the end, I guess you get what you pay for..."
2,It's not what you think it is.,"I purchased this video in conjunction with the book of the same title, which was being used in my church thinking it would be teaching on each chapter of the book. It is nothing than short clips trying to sell the book"
1,Part of Order Not Received,"Of the 3 discs ordered, I only received Disc 3. I did contact shipper but have had no reply as of this date."
3,Useful for light duty home use,"I bought the reconditioned model, it was clean and had seen very little use.It cuts through wall tile satisfactorily, but is very slow on tougher floor tile. Very handy for cutting trim tiles with little fuss.For infrequent use around the home it is OK."
4,Beautifully done,"As Henderson points out in his introduction, most translators are traitors. Though this is so in many cases, the pieces that he selected work well and push the envelope of what good translation of poetry of all kinds should be, regardless of the original language.This is an excellent pocket anthology for any lover of Haiku and other short form poetry to carry with them always."
4,Inspiring and Informative,"I've read a dozen or so books on triathlon. Some are more informative (like Complete Triathon Book by Matt Fitzgerald and The Triathlete's Training Bible by Joe Friel) and some are more inspiring (like Becoming an Ironman by Kara Douglas Thom), but this book strikes a nice balance between being informative and inspiring. I especially like the many tips on time management--how to work your full training program around demands of work and family. So why not 5 stars? I think the book should have been 50 pages longer and included more depth in some of the important subjects that all triathletes need to know about."
3,Polishing marble,"4"" JX Shine Diamond Polishing Pad - Set of 8 with Free Back HolderI purchased it from Toolocity.com via Amazon.The Pads arrived quickly, they were simply packed in a zip-lock with no instructions and invoice provided. Product features on Amazon states that the pads must be used WET ONLY and they are suitable for marble polishing.I shop at AMAZON quiet often and what bothers me about shopping here is the lack of information regarding the items as well as lack of descriptions. AMAZON should definitely work better toward fixing those issues.I am giving this item 3 stars because I was able to make my marble to look half way as good as new. I am still working on it....."
5,"as Patsy would say...""Fabulous Darling!""","As a pro Disc Jockey for 15+ years, it takes a really great song (much less a cover) to get me excited. Indeed, some songs do improve when covered, but this is not just a cover...it's a wonderful remake. As dance remixes go, this cut totally embodies within itself the true depth and emotion Ms. Holliday gave her original Broadway hit. Granted, you most likely won't hear this one on your favorite top 40 station, and unless you know who Jennifer Holliday is, you won't even care...but you will love it from the first beat to the last. Get this CD...(or 12"" Wax...for the old skool)"
2,"I Love Jennifer, but...","I am one of Jennifer Holliday's greatest fans, but I was not impressed with her 20th anniversary rendition of And I am Telling You. I feel like she took the one of the most important pieces of work she has ever recorded, and really bastardized it. I hate to say that. I just hope we will see a full length album of Jennfer singing from her R&B roots very soon."
5,"Get the rest of the ""Consistent Tennis Wins"" 8 DVD Series","Tom Avery doesn't over-complicate things, nor does he oversimplify them. You can't wait to apply what you've learned!I have the whole 8 DVD series of his called, ""Consistent Tennis Wins"", which I also recommend.These DVDs deal with the:ServeReturn of ServeBackhandAbility to SwingNet PlaySingles & Doubles TipsSpecialty Shots (lobs, slice, etc) and theOriginalIt costs more than others, because you get what you pay for! Get the DVD"
5,My Wife Hates This Minibust,"Like the title says, my wife hates this sculpt of Powergirl but I guess that is about the best endorsment I can give! It is a fine sculpt in a dynamic pose of a less popular character...one of my favorite minibust from DC. Now if I could just get my wife to stop posing Wonder Woman like she's punching Power Girl in the stomach..."
3,mad and upset,One or two of the cd's had a deep scratch and ruined a lot of songs. not in good condition
4,"Lacking that ""intangible something""","Any worship CD produced by Don Moen is necessarily good music, and this double-CD is no exception. Especially worshipful to me are: ""I Could Sing of Your Love Forever,"" ""Open the Eyes of My Heart,"" ""Above All,"" ""Eagle's Wings,"" ""Be Magnified,"" ""The Potter's Hand,"" ""All Creation Worships You,"" and ""Shout to the Lord.""The first half of both discs is celebratory and high energy, bringing a sense of relief when the pace slows in later songs. Although missing an ""intangible something"" that naturally engages the soul in worship, this collection is good music with the expected Hosanna sound and quality, and that extra something would certainly be there were this a live performance.Although a good recording, if you are looking for great worship music, may I suggest you consider ""Songs 4 Worship: Shout to the Lord."""
5,great worship!,this is one of the best worship cd's i've ever listened to... drives you into God's presence... beautiful
3,not very good,"I am a huge fan of royce gracie and i was awaiting to get this book for a long time. however as soon as i opened it up i realized that it was nothing but a rehash of popular gym wisdom. approximately 90% of this book is pictures of royce doing various exercises e.g. bicep curls,incline presses, static stretches etc,etc,. the rest of book just shows you how to oranize a program with these exercises depending on your current level of fitness.Lastly the explanation of the famous gracie diet is pathetic its only 2 pages long. all in all skip this book and go for something else"
5,Excellent for adding to your current workout!,"This book is a very good way to add some variety to your workouts, stretching and overall fitness. Good luck with your training."
2,90% Fitness book. 10% Jiu jitsu book.,"I was hoping this book would be more jiu-jitsu specific, with drills and exercises designed to improve my guard, sprawling, throwing etc. Instead, however, it's just the same-old stuff you'll find in any fitness book.There is a chapter on getting ready for fights, and a couple of pages on the Gracie diet, but this book is mostly just pictures of Royce gracie doing various simple exercises while wearing a flashy Atama rash guard."
4,"Great vocals, great guitar playing","A rocking blues album! The CD contains both ballads and hard-rocking blues, all of which Ms. Connor plays quite wonderfully. I enjoy listening to this CD while I write."
3,Organic book,"The book was fine. It's our class textbook and it was cheaper new that it was used in the bookstore at school. However, I had problems with it being shipped with me. The street I live on got renumbered and UPS was unable to find my house. I ended up picking it up from their offices even though I paid to have it shipped next day. So that was a huge hassle with amazon and their shipper UPS."
2,Don't buy it,"My professor use this book for Organic Chem 1 so I bought it. After reading one chapter, I decided to return the book and dropped the class. This book just make the Organic Chemistry very un-organization. Hard to read and follow, not logic writing. Do not buy and use the book, if you want to get A or A- on your Organic Chem."
4,A Novel which reads like real life,"Mulk Raj Anand has contributed a timeless and poignant account of the plight of the untouchable of India. Although this is a novelization of untouchable life, it reads like real life. For those beginning their education about the untouchable outcasts of India, this book will give them an immediate, up-close and personal look into the hellish world that was untouchability. The lead character Bakha (a street sweeper) experiences the furious oppression and scorn of being a polluted untouchable, and at the end of the book witnesses the arrival of Mohandas Gandhi, who preached the abolition of untouchability, and wanted to uplift the ""harijan"", as he called them. Inspired by Gandhi, he hopes to lead a better life, and to escape a life of torment and squalor. This short book is a quick and engaging read for those who wish to have an inside look at what life was like for the untouchables."
2,Disappointing,"Very disappointing follow-up to Countdown. Two story lines are poorly integrated, and the characters poorly realized."
2,THE CARD IS 5 STARS BUT....,THE CARD IS 5 STARS BUT THE SUPPORT AND THE UPGRADE ON THE CATALIST SOFTWARE IS 1 STAR. IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE IF YOU CAN GET LUCKY WITH THE CATALIST SOFTWARE AND IT DOESN'T MESS UP WHAT HAD BEEN WORKING FOR YOU THEN YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING ME AND 10 OTHERS I'VE TALKED WITH HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO. GOOD LUCK!
4,Great Card!,"I upgraded from my old ati 7500 after a lot of online research. With my old PC, an Athlon 1800+ and 512MB pc 2100 I managed to score 25 000 on Aquamark, and 6000 on 3dMark 2003!!Great performer and easy to overclock!Totally recomend it."
1,POS,this card works great until i upgraded to a AMD 64 bit prossessor with a MSI motherboard. Now it constantly flickers and freezes everytime i start a game. I also bought a 9550 thinking that the 9600 went bad and to my amazement it wasnt the card being bad. I will never buy another ATI product EVER AGAIN!! their CATALIST messed up my 9600 and same for the 9550!!
5,Much respect,"to a man who chose life. I read this book 2 years ago and it still moves me. As he said, he is a gang expert as he has lived it and those who have are the only gang experts. And the brother definately takes you with him through his own self-hatred, pain, confusion, and, ultimately, enlightment. He could teach a thing or two to all the fake thugs and wanna-be Crips and Bloods all over NYC."
3,Give Me a Break,"I bought this book thinking I would learn that my impression of gangbangers as empty-headed thugs might be changed. The only thing that changed is that I am now fourteen dollars poorer.Kody Scott is a loser who is trying to save face. He went from a loser who thought he was invincible to one who has rethought his entire history to make himself a victim. He hates white people, or ""Americans"", as he calls them, as opposed to Hispanics, New Afrikans (black people he approves of) and Negroes (black people he doesn't approve of). He's not a man. He's an overgrown child playing a racial version of Dungeons and Dragons in his head to rationalize the mind-numbing violence he's inflicted on other people. Stupid, stupid, stupid.How can their mothers (the mothers of ALL gang members, regardless of color) allow this to go on?"
2,Disappointing...,"I got lost somewhere around page 80. He tries too hard to sound intelligent. The writer dropped out of school and thinks he needs to prove his intellect with painfully large words and overuse of ""forthcoming, whereas, per se, thus"" and the use of ""overstand"" in place of understand and ""for"" in place of because. The writing wasn't interesting enough to keep me struggling through the language flow of the book. I had high hopes :("
2,Interesting portrayal of life as a gang member,"I found this book captivating with its portrayal of the violent life of an LA gang member. The author does an excellent job of illustrating the hardships youth must face when growing up in this corrupt environment. The main problem I had with this book was the fact that the author never seems to comprehend how his violent actions deeply affect the people he associates with and also society as a whole. For example during one of his many stays in prison he wonders why the guards treat him with such fear and resentment. Could it possibly be because he has shot and killed so many people. I was glad to read that his life of gang banging has finally come to an end, but I also feel that he should be punished for the numerous criminal activities he has been involved in. It is hard to applaud an author who has lead such a destructive and misguided life."
5,TOTALLY AMAZING!!!,WHEN I READ THIS BOOK I WAS TOTALLY FLABERGASTED.I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW HARD THIS MAN IS.IT REALLY DEPICTS GANG LIFE IN LA.I JOINED A GANG WHEN I WAS 15 IVE SEEN PEOPLE DIE OF DRUGS GET CHIVED GET REALLY SMASHED UP BUT ITS NOTHIN COMPARED TO LIFE IN LA IVE DONE JAIL IVE SEEN A LOT OF THINGS BUT ITS QUITE LAME TO THE THINGS MONSTER KODY SCOTT DEPICTED IN HIS BOOK IF I HAD READ THIS BOOK 9 YEARS AGO IT COULD HAVE CHANGED THE WAY I WAS THEN ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS A GREAT BOOK AND ITS SO SCAREY IN SOME WAYS!!!
5,Alot more people neeed to read this book,Love this book but this book left me wanting more like what happened after he left prison in 91.I learned alot from this book things i didn't know;very good book.
4,"Raw, no-apologies account of a gangster","This book was quite good. For most chapters, I literally couldn't put it down. I was facinated by the straight-forwardness of it all. The author makes few apologies for his actions and I think it made the book a better read (after all, how do you apologize for causing so much misery to so many people). The only part that became tiresome was the ""kill whitey"" theme in the latter chapters. I certainly respect his opinion and his perspective, but this theme was a little overdone (in my opinion). It took away from quality of the story. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. I always think that you can measure the quality of a book by how much you think about it when you are done. I think about this book quite a bit."
4,a story that should make you think,This is an excellent memoir about a Crips gang member. Easy to read and well worth the time.
5,tite azz book,if u wanna know sumthin about LA gangs i reccomend this book. i read it for 9 hours straight and now its one of my fav. books. go get it. ~peace~
5,Riveting,"Monster gives a birds eye view into the demanding, dangerous and vicious life of Los Angeles' most notorious gangs. The book gives insight into initiation process as well as gang life in the streets and behind bars. Anyone who thinks gangs are just a fad or something that only affects youth should read this book!"
5,NOT ABLE TO PUT DOWN! ~SO GOOD & ENTERTAINING,I could not put this book down. It was so interesting. The words were so descriptive and captivating. It almost made me want join a gang. jk. Informative and exciting. He keep it real without being too gruesome.
3,Interesting and Unclear,"While this book is a interesting and has a unique point of view, it receives much more credit than it deserves. The story line is nearly impossible to follow since it is hightly non-linear and very episodic. There were too many names of individuals and gangs to keep track of. I never felt I learned much about why people join gangs and why they continue on the killing, and killing, and killing. I'm not sure the author knows either. Plus, his transformation to blaming the white man for inner-city trouble was glossed over. In the end, I found I was a passive reader."
4,Gripping End To End,"The book gives the reader a chilling look at the early ""Gangsta"" era and brings the reader into the hectic and dangerous life of gang banging."
4,Street Gang's become the only way of life,This book was pretty much an eye opener. It showed the life of a LA gang member and how his whole life if built around gang banging. I recommend this book to people who don't understand what people lives are and try to criticize. What would you do if you were brought up in that scope. Read it and understand it and you may open your eyes a bit.
3,It showed the struggle of a young gang member,"This book was all right, but it was by no means the best gang book out there. I would not recommend this book to anybody who wanted to learn a lot about gangs. This book focused primarily on the life a young African-American gang member. I give Shakur credit because he was able to turn his life around, but the book was too drawn out."
2,"Poor effort, man.","Kody seems to revel in the thought of being seen as some sort of hero for his 'no surrender' attitude throughout this book. I just feel so sad that someone who had so much energy should direct all of it towards violence towards other people.What is it about the west side that turns kids into killers? Silly boys who think the answer to everything is violence. Where did it get young Mr Scott? A life sentence in prison, that's where.Scotts attempts to explain away his gang membership by stating that he was doing it to protect his 'hood. What absolute rubbish. He, like so many other impressionable young black men, like the perceived glory and excitement of the gang. Sad."
3,Tough,"This book is tough! When I read this, I was living in a small town in the Northwest, with a low occurrence of violent crime and an obscenely high average education level (lot's of dishwashers with Master's degrees), but nonetheless, while reading this book, I would find myself riding around in my friends' cars, and wondering why I'd left my ""gat"" @ home. Considering I don't even own a gun, that is fairly impressive. The book is engrossing,entertaining and thought provoking, all in equal measure. I mean it's no Autobiography of Malcolm X, but I'd say it is definitely a biography worth reading."
3,not bad,Not a bad read but not a great read either. I found this book easy to read and not two deep.
4,Best Required Reading,I had to read this for my Juvenile Justice Class and it was one of the few required readings that I enjoyed. It was very interesting to learn the inside of a culture that you only hear about in songs or in the news. Very enlightening.
4,Frightening but need to read it,"The calm and unhurried taking of human life is dreadful but you gain a perspective that you would not normally have of gang life and expectations.Further, there is a glimmer of hope as the author ages and matures - the frightening part of all of it is the generational sequences that are still being followed as far as gang membership is concerned."
3,Who's the Monster?,"This book isn't as riveting or revealing as I expected. In my opinion, the parenting that produced this ""monster"" should have been examined and discussed honestly."
5,YOU NEED TO READ THIS!,"I acquired, this book many years ago, never read it and loaned it to a friend before ever turning the front cover. Fast forward 2 weeks ago (return of the book), and wow I feel like I slept on something major. I really enjoyed ""Monster"". Monster Kody thoroughly explores early LA gang culture and tells his story from childhood to manhood through the streets of LA to the California Prison System. The story is well written and although bordering on over-elaborate at times, you never get the sense that the author is just ""putting you on"", this is really his mentality and the sentiments (and code) that his peers share. I definitely feel that it serves as an eye opener and great insight, for those who are unaware of just exactly what Los Angeles Gang Culture is really all about."
3,very addictive,"My wife introduced me to this drama which i found very addictive. She found it on the web and after watching a few poorly downloaded episodes on you tube decided to buy the dvd. Only problem is you must use a high end DVD player to watch dvds, Video is choppy and sound distorted on low end models"
1,Not Much,"I've never had much of an opinion on abortion either way. I bought this book because of a college term paper on the pros and cons of abortion. Crutcher is undoubtedly anti-abortion, there is no doubt about that. Some of the sources are good. Others, however, are second-hand editorials that are highly questionable. He dug very deep to find about 120 or so deaths from abortion during the last thirty years, not mentioning that 40 million women have had abortions during that time--and have not died from it--and not to mention that nine times more women have died from an appendectomy. There is therefore no attempt to document all sides of the equation here--this is hardly an objective account. Sure, it makes for sensationilist reading. But if anything, Lime 5 is a ironic testimony on the safety of abortion during the last thirty years."
2,comedians missing from the dvd,"There were some comedians missing from the dvd, i wish i could have gotting the 1 with all the comedians. It would have ben much better & worth it."
4,Excellent for Newcomers to SRV/DT,"The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan is an outstanding introduction to the greatest guitarist of the last 30 years. Being an SRV/DT completist, I already have these songs in one form or another, so I would have liked to have seen some additional, previously unreleased tracks. If you're new to SRV, pick up this collection first, then work your way backwards from In Step (his masterpiece) to Texas Flood for some incredible album tracks not included on The Essential SRV. Then get Live at Montreaux 1982-1985 for a pair of absolutely blistering live sets.Just ensure that Voodoo Chile (Slight Return) is played at MAXIMUM volume for greatest enjoyment!RIP, SRV - there will NEVER be another musician of your calibre."
5,A rich collection of Stevie,"These two discs in no uncertain terms show why Stevie and Double Trouble were and continue to live on as the greatest blues trio of all time. There was never any doubt about Stevie's guitar virtuousity. His great timing, his powerful voice. Then there is the underrated rhythm section. Tommy Shannon is a bassist extraordinaire. Chris Layton is a drummer who stays in the pocket but plays with taste and complements the others in the band the way Mitch Mitchell did for Hendrix and Noel Redding. The live version of Voodoo Child (Slight Return), though a bit long, underscores the urgency and excitement of their performance. You have to imagine yourself in the audience that night in New York City and then you will forgive his excess, as Stevie exhaltingly states after the song how ""fun"" it is playing Hendrix at Carnegie Hall!"
3,The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble,Too much Stevie Ray for me. I loved Crossfire but not much more will make my playlists unless I open a rib joint and play hm for background. The quality of recording could have also been better
1,Defective Disc 1,Three sets -- three defective Discs 1 -- no problems with Disc 2. Obviously a systemic problem. Gave up. Too bad -- really wanted this set.
1,The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble,This CD is defective. We had two shipped to us and both would not play any music. It was very frustrating dealing with returning and then receiving the new CD with the same problem again. We still do not know how good the music was because we never had the opportunity to listen to it.
3,An okay cd,"Best track on this disc is 'The Sky is Crying'. Otherwise, I'd recommend The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughn and Double Trouble. Much better."
5,Excellent CD,"His playing is phenomenal, his touch is incredible, and his singing is right on. The live version of Voodoo Child is unbeatable and The Sky is Crying shows why he is the tone king. Despite missing ""Ain't gonna give up on love"" this is a superb collection."
4,My nephew loved it!,"Cute tee shirt for my nephew's 4th birthday, he loved it. Like other kids, when he got clothes he would just throw them aside and look for the next present. When he opened this shirt, he couldn't quit looking at the dinosaurs. It was a hit!"
1,Unsatisfactory,"This product was advertised as the Spanish Edition and listed as ""Nearly New."" I received the English Edition with a child's scribbles throughout the book."
3,"Great band, lots of potential but...","...Horrible recording quality. I don't know maybe the sound is what they were looking for, maybe it's their style. This band is really good, I see them being big in the future, which will hopefully put them on a lable more capable of capturing their bizarre sound. maybe the newer cd is better quality. Just be warned, the recording sounds very amatuer, like out of someone's garage."
3,A Good Book That Overcomes Some Glaring Weaknesses,"As the heading suggets, DD Guttenplan's book is a strong example of research that has flaws but is still worth reading. Some commenters have said that Guttenplan sometimes seemed to personally like David Irving more than Deborah Lipstadt, and I don't disagree, but that allowed me to take this into account, note that Guttenplan doesn't really have much insight to Jewish issues or the Holocaust in a broader context, and focus on his observations about Irving's warped mindset and the London trial. That's where the book stakes it claim and ultimately where it succeeds."
2,new saint joseph sunday missle,"the book is not the newest edition. it's the same as the one i have. there is a new edition that was started in Nov, 2011 with current translations.besides the fact that it's not current i had to wait 5 weeks for it."
3,New St Joseph Sunday Missal and Hymnal,"The missal was not what I was expecting. When it said ""new"", I thought it was the new revised Mass (Nov 2011)."
1,Wrong product description,This missal is incorrect. It is not the 2011 version of text. I will be returning it.Their description in the ads should be corrected.
5,Favorite Summer Color!!,OPI Smok'n in Havana is the perfect shade of shimmer burnt orange (best way I can describe it). It works great with everything from neutral tones to earthy and it's vivid enough to complement the bold colors now in fashion.I've been wearing this color for a while and I'm disappointed it's discontinued!!
3,Review Ice Castles,"A good book is a good book, even if the pages are brown with age, which this book definitely was. It arrived timely and safely however, so no real problem."
5,love the movie and teh book,Ice Castles the novel is a more detailed version of teh movie and reading it was some of the best few hours I hvae ever spent. Utterly enjoyable!
2,Don't start from here,"I think David Axelrod is hip. I really do. But this late 60's effort, while you might find it engaging on a poetical and on an ""awareness"" level, is rather out of focus on a compositional one, especially if compared to the William Blake-themed ones he did before.Definitely for collection purposes."
3,Wierd One,"David Axelrod's first two albums Song of Innocence and Songs of Experience fused rock, classical, jazz, and psychedelia to create music rich in color, dynamics, and darn goodiness. With Earth Rot, Axelrod switches up his M.O. and creates a concept CD about the environment with lyrics based on the Book of Isiah in the Bible. For all of his good intentions with this project, Earth Rot fails to be anything more than good haunted house music."
5,Kindle edition review - love the commentary - not on kindle,"One of my favorite commentaries, but the Kindle version does not have a working table of contents which renders it completely useless."
1,An unnavigable mass of data,"While the value of Albert Barnes' commentary is unquestionable, this is a typical example of a lack of professionalism (and consideration for the user) on the part of amateur Kindle publishers.This Kindle book has absolutely no navigational links--no table of contents--which renders it next to useless, unless the user wishes to create his/her own bookmarks to books and chapters--something the publisher could have done in less than a half hour, assuming a minimal level of skill in HTML design.I would have preferred to pay more for a book I could use!Buyer beware!"
3,Magic Slim still got some magic!,"I just got this CD during the annual Chicago BluesFest and it is a pretty good collection of cool Chicago electric blues. I've been a fan of Magic Slim's for several years and always make it a point to track him down whenever he plays Chicago. This is, however, a formulaic album and rehashes a lot of typical blues themes and rhythms. The first few albums by Magic were stellar, but he is starting to rehash the sound. Still good though if this is your first venture into Magic Slim!"
4,Honest is the word,"For some reason I had never even heard of Yama until recently. Just imagine my surprise upon picking this up and finding a spectacular classic. Kuprin does indeed tread that fine line between cheese and morality (both being boorish methods of storytelling) to create a truly human picture of Russian society. If you are interested in the glorification of vice and youthful indiscretions, please reread Burroughs, Miller or Selby. Likewise, if you are interested in moral high ground, stick to Tolstoy. Here, Kuprin deftly defies the clichés to create not only a wonderful illustration of Russian life but a great story as well. This is amazing considering the time period in which it was written."
5,Advertising the way it was meant to be,"I read this book in junior high school and it made advertising seem like so much fun and so interesting that I am now, like Mr. Della Femina, a copywriter in Manhattan. It is not as glamorous or as lucrative for me as it has been for him, but I'm not complaining. There are dozens of great anecdotes, one of which provides the title of the book. Unfortunately, I lent it to a work associate, who lent it to a girl at the agency who he was trying to date, and I never saw it again. So if you find a copy, read it and hang on to it"
4,Aging...but still valid,"On the surface, this insider's view of the advertising game may seem dated. But if you really look, you realize that though the set dressings have changed...the same idiot play is still topping the bill."
4,Westcoast Heisman indeed,WC has quietly held down the WestCoast with help from other key players. Ghetto Heisman is that dope for the Westcoast fiends. It provides good beats and a lot of Westcoast imagery. WC sticks to keeping it real with the west coast sound unlike Game or Xzibit. This album is for the C walkers and G talkers. He surprisingly has a guest appearane from Case which sounds good. Hey just go buy the damn album!
5,one of the best cd's ive ever heard,WC is one of the greatest rappers out there. but if you dont know who WC is he's a member of westside connection. I also recomend Westside connection's TERRORIST THREATS if you love this albume.This is a great albume. I've listend 2 almost every song on this;)
2,what you hear is what you get,"This cd isn't that great. I'm not saying it's bad, i only gave it 2 stars to bring down the average review.You've heard all these song before maybe from another artist, but you've definately heard them.Only a few songs stand out and even they don't stand that much above the rest of the cd. I would recommend jayo felony or westside connection or C-Bo if you like this you may like those a little more. I see people giving this cd 4-5 stars WHY?? like i said its not bad but it doesn't even touch being a classic."
5,Great CD for many tastes,"Equally suited to chilling in a beach hammock or driving down the freeway, Kirker's CD can be at the same time relaxing and exciting. If you like bands like Guster and can't stand Neil Diamond, this one's for you."
3,Disappointing,"I got this because I liked ""Dawn"", another of her books.These two characters never caught my attention.There was lots going on with the shop girls and the mistress's dimwitted son, and the competing shop keepers, but none of it was that interesting to me."
3,Rachmaninoff Symphonic Dances,"I bought the Reference Recording CD of Rachmaninoff Symphonic Dances,here conducted by Eiji Oue and the Minnesota Orchestra, hoping to have an exhilarating audio experience, but alas, it was sorely lacking, at least for me, and it did not at all compare with the Turnabout recording with Donald Johanos and the Dallas Symphony, but then again, what else does? The Turnabout is one of the best recordings I ever heard. It is a prime example of recording quality, performance, sound stage, and all of this on an ordinary budget label!!! I find it rather unbelievable that Mr. Johanos would not become as well known as any of the great conductors of the '60s and 70s, considering what he got to bring out of the Dallas Symphony players, just breathtaking and unbelievable.So forget about the Reference Recordings one, but definitely, definitely get Turnabout one... it will turn you about!!!"
3,"Good quality, runs small","I bought this for my four year old. It is a nice shirt, well made, but it does run small. I should have gone up one size."
1,Worst CD Ever,"This CD is overwhelmingly bad. All kinds of problems. Where do I start? TKA is supposed to be the kings of freestyle and there's only two freestyle songs on the album. Those songs are not even what most people would consider ""real freestyle"". The irony is that those two songs are the worst songs I ever heard and I love freestyle. Most of the rest of the album sounds like some wannabe pop music. The only positive aspect is the dj production on the house tracks. It sounds almost as if TKA sabatoged their own music--like they're not even trying. TKA is capable of much more. It may not be completely their fault. After all, the record label most likely issued the command ""No Freestyle or the project is off"". I gaurantee that no one besides their relatives will like this album."
1,Garbage 2,"I saw a review by someone named Maria Lopez, and she must be related to TKA because she does not know good music."
1,What happened?,"How can anyone listen to this and actually say this is the TKA we all know and love. Guys go back and try again!!! The only good thing about this cd is the cover. Don't wait too much longer, I don't want to to hear MARIA(the AARP version)."
1,Garbage Part 2,I just read a review by someone named Maria Lopez. You must be there cousin or something b/c you don't know music. Please ignore her review b/c this Cd is garbage.
1,Not a freestyle genre,"If you want buy a freestyle cd, don't buy TKA.Looks like a Latin Dance music or something like that.I spend my money for nothing."
3,No Helmet and Roller Skates,This item is cute but it does not come with roller skates and helmet...this was very disappointing. I am going to keep it though.
1,So Dim You Might As Well Use A Lighter,"All of the flashlights included in this pack are far too dim. I went into my bathroom, turned off the lights and turned on the each flash light to see how powerful they were. Then I used a generic lighter and noticed that it was just as bright as these lights... Also the battery life for the useless flashlights included in this package is very small compared to LED lights (which are brighter than these.) Also, these flashlights require expensive batteries to power up. This is very costly... I find myself confused by the amount of powerful batteries needed in order for these flashlights to shine their very dim light.Save yourself in the future and some money right now by not purchasing these. They will not be much more helpful than a lighter for guidance in the dark and you may want to consider relying on a more reliable set of flashlights."
5,Mon bel oranger!,"I read this book in French when I was just a littel girl in primary school and it made me cry so hard that I loved it and hated it at the same time! It was so overwhelming, I think it forced me to grow up. I want to read it again now and to buy it for my future kids. It's probably been over 15 years, but I still believe it's the best book I ever read!"
5,a marvelous book,"I have read this book many years ago in my native language,a translation to Turkish... I still remember it... I have cried with joy and sorrow both. This book rises your spirits and I feel regret that it is not available now, so I can't read it in English... recommend to everyone..."
4,"definitely worth the purchase...if you love hip-hop, and want to hear some incredible samples, you'll love this album!","GREAT ALBUM! Supastition is such a talented lyricist that basically nobody seems to really know anything about...hes basically backed by his backyard producer M-phazes...and together they come up with some pretty worthwhile music to listen to. The seemingly endless variety of samples and near-flawless production for each track makes this album worth the buy. Supastition's lyricism on top of the M-phazes clean tracks make for a great album. This was a perfect follow-up, solo album to ""Deadline""...I would give this a 4.5 if I could."
5,Supastition - ur favorite mc's favorite mc!!!,"If you dont know Supastition by now, get familiar, because he is easily in the top 5 mc's out there. This album shows and proves his mic skills over and over throughout each track. This is a must buy for anyone trying to keep that ""real hip-hop"" alive. You'll have this in ur cd player for a long time after you buy it, trust me. ""That's why they hate my face..."""
5,"If You Love Great Guitarists, you have to have this!!","This is the first CD I ever bought by Jimmy Thackery after seeing him perform live in Johnson City. This CD captures just a little of the magic of a live performance. There is nothing better than the 'Apache' track. 'That's How I Feel' with Mark Stutso (the drummer) singing, is great on the CD, but there is nothing like seeing any of the music performed live. All of Jimmy's CD's are good, but this one is great all the way through."
1,Stinks.....waste of time and boring....read why---,"2004 was one of the best NASCAR seasons I can remember. By centering this video around the drivers who made the Chase, NASCAR IMAGES did the 2004 campaign a great disservice. Their previous ""Year In Review"" formats were MUCH better and much more entertaining. Of course, everything else about NASCAR has disappointed me since then, so in the grand scheme of things, I suppose a DVD is small beans. Glad it was only a buck."
4,"good folks, good software!","They did a timely job, and they are the kind of folks you would want to deal with!"
1,Just doesn't work well with my Macbook Pro,"I was trying it to link an external hard drive and it constantly freezes the program and crashes the computer. What a waste of money! Belkin is pretty useless when it comes to support, too..."
3,Item in good condition but not compatible.,"Ordered this item, took while to get here. found out incompatibility with desired device. Took a few emails and phone calls to get an RMA, and it was denied despite my trying to exchange for the appropriate item, and no favorable options were suggested. Not sure if doing business with seller in the future. Good luck"
1,Belkin Firewire 800 ExpressCard doesn't work with Windows Vista on Thinkpad T61 or Windows XP on Thinkpad T60,"I bought this card and two lexar firewire 800 compact flash card readers. First off, I was amazed to find out there isn't a Vista driver for this card. OK, I can deal. I downloaded the latest driver from Belkin on my wife's T50 which has XP. Rebooted the machine with the card and the lexar compact flash reader installed. Nothing happens. No drive letter magically appears. What a piece of trash. Shame on you Belkin. J. Hart. P.S. their service department doesn't apparently answer emails either."
2,Wait for more information before buying,"Works with my MacBook Pro 15"" with powered devices but was very sad to find out that it does not work with my 2.5 inch firewire external drive which is powered off of the computer. There is a power input (no help in knowing how to work it) on the side of the device. Adding power from a USB port lit up the drive but would not spin it up. I don't know if it is a power issue or an interface issue with the firmware on my external drive. Belkin's site is useless as there is no support info, extremely limited info on the product, and they don't respond to email. I would have rated them even lower but I have to take responsibility for buying it right out of the chute."
1,"Stay Away - this does not work with my MacBook Pro 15""","I have to say I am very unimpressed by the support from Belkin on this product.

1,bad fit,"When you have a 9.5 foot and put it in a size large that is 8.5 to 9.5, it is too small.When you put your foot in an extra large that is 9,5 to 10.5, it is too big.Neither size accommodates a true 9.5 with a good fit."
5,very soft and comfy slippers,"I have neuropathy, so most days getting a shoe on my foot is sheer torture. I have these in several colors, and I love them!"
5,just whatmy feet needed,"I have tender skin on the bottom of my feet and wearing slipper socks or terry cloth slippers rubs so much that they cause my skin to crack open in places. I tried satin slippers and while they were okay, they weren't as flexible as I like.When I saw these, I ordered one pair and now I am back for more. I'm not looking for support in a slipper, just comfort and being kind to my soles. These are as supple as socks and I enjoy wearing them around the house. I am glad that the leather botton is slip resistant. They are also washable!"
2,My own fault,"I was very disappointed with these slippers, but I can only blame myself. I had done a search for isotoner slippers and these came up. I thought I was getting a great deal and didn't check the specifics of the slipper. They are not well made and don't look like they will hold up very well. I was also taken aback by their return policy. They ship for free, but charge more than the slipper itself to accept the return."
2,Low Quality,"I actually thought I was buying Isotoner slippers on clearance: My mistake!These slippers are truly what they say ""You get what you pay for""!They are very low in quality. The shipping cost more than the product, other wise I would have returned them! My advice--stick with a brand you know and like!Slipper Less Literally"
2,Messy Shipping,"Shoes are O.K., not the best but delivery method that they were sent SUCKS. It tookalmost a month and two phone calls to get the product. Can't send anyone to thistroubled ordering site."
4,good quality but a bit small & expensive.,excellent leather quality. silky smooth feel. though a little small / compact & can't store much else. and looks a little girly for a guy. to expensive to justify the purchase.
2,Kept waiting for it to get good...,"what a let-down of a movie.....not funny at all! Don't waste your time watching it. I can usually find something I like about a movie, but not with this one."
1,Waste of time,"I was very disappointed in this movie. It wasn't funny at all. Paul Rudd is such a better actor and comedian than this. The whole movie was about people whining and complaining. I would not recommend this film to anyone, especially a Paul Rudd fan. He was great in Role Models and Knocked Up. If that's the kind of character you were expecting, you will be immensely disappointed."
1,Another vehicle to help further carry the Men-Are-Idiots meme,"As if we didn't have enough of these already, The Weinstein Company has condescended to festoon us with yet another depressing piece of vacuity intended to do nothing more than aid us in mocking our own mediocrity. This it does by further perpetuating the cultural meme of successful, savvy, sensible, or principled women versus their imbecilic, directionless male counterparts. The residual memetic ""implant"" of this film, and scores of others like it, is the notion that women have evolved into creatures vastly superior to men, the latter of whom are still mired is their vestigial, knuckle-dragging ways. This is also reflected in the manner in which men are often portrayed as feckless dullards in commercials and TV shows whenever a couple or family are involved. This is clownish entertainment for the feeble-minded and those of you who find this sort of film amusing do nothing more than celebrate your own enslavement."
1,Time is to precious to spend it watching this nonsense!,"Time is to precious to spend it watching this nonsense! I kept waiting for something/anything to happen. But, it never did. Waste of film and waste of your time."
1,Bleh......,"Just not funny....story was completely uninteresting, characters flat and UN-funny. This was just a terrible movie. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Not worth more then the .99 I paid for the rent.,This movie did have some funny parts to it - but it really was a stupid story all in all. It was really not worth the two hours of my life I wasted on it.
3,Okay buy a little idiotic.,"I think my title says it all for this movie. It was watchable and even slightly enjoyable, but not world class by any means."
2,Unfortunately Not My Cup of Tea,"I found this movie to be inane and just plain not funny to me. I had a very hard time watching the entire thing. It didn't hold my attention at all.After watching the trailors on TV for this movie, I sort of expected something slightly like ""Dumb and Dumber"" maybe. The humor was too subtle or something and there seemed to be long stretches where there was no humor at all. At the end, Paul Rudd's character was pretty much the same as the beginning. Quite honestly, I felt that the storyline just went nowhere.My husband watched this movie some months before I did either on pay-per-view or one of the movie channels on our satellite and he told me he wished he'd have known I was getting it from Amazon because he would have saved me the trouble. He didn't like it either and generally he likes comedies a lot more than I tend to.There just was nothing outstanding about this film for me.Bottom line: This one is not a keeper."
3,"Funny, kind of heartwarming","The DVD is exactly what it looks like - a DVD of the movie. No digital copy, minimal other special features (director's commentary, outtakes, and a ""making of"") - just the film.The movie itself is entertaining enough - it's a story about three sisters and their idiot brother. It opens with the Paul Rudd as the brother, getting busted doing something really stupid - it's just that he meant well and he was trying to help a ""friend"". He ends up in jail, and upon his release has to depend on his sisters to put him up while he's on parole. Obviously, he exposes that they're more effed up than he is, but they're also so caught up they don't see it and - surprise - they each end up learning a life lesson from him. Oh, and there's the thing with his ex and his dog.I enjoyed the movie, but mostly for Rudd, who is pretty much perfect for the role. The plot is thin and obvious, but it moves along and there are some good jokes about how ""trusting"" is often mistaken for ""stupid""."
4,Our Idiot Brother,"Overall, a recommended movie with a great cast. Video and Audio quality is good, and there is some worthwhile bonus material (although I wish there had been cast interviews included).DVD SPECSMovie Run Time: 90 MinutesVideo: Anamorphic Widescreen (aspect ratio 1.78:1)Audio: Dolby Digital 5.1 SurroundSubtitle Option: English & SpanishSpecial Features:- Commentary by Director Jesse Peretz- 3 Deleted/Extended Scenes + Alternate Ending- Making of ""Our Idiot Brother"" (14 minutes)"
4,Pleasant couple of hours,"Although this probably deserved 3 stars, I gave it 4 because there is just something about Paul Rudd that makes me want to like it. Paul Rudd brings any movie into your living room and relates it to all the average minutes we spend with friends that aren't over the top.Then to add in Zooey and Liz? Forgetaboutit!Will make you go to bed with a smile. What more do you want for a few bucks?"
4,"Feel good comedy, refreshing change","All of the actors in this movie are amazing! So nice to see a film that is smart, funny, and feel-good. I really did not want to watch it, but decided to because I love all of the actresses. Glad I did! Refreshing change! It will make you smile."
3,Fun to watch,I enjoyed this movie and I do like Paul Rudd in just about anything. This wasn't one of his best as he didn't have much character depth (even the dog beat him in that area). I thought the best character was his ex-girlfriend at the house-farm. Her pained looks at Paul knowing what he is not capable of and wanting him just gone from her life. They looked so real. But she wouldn't let him take their dog. Even a dog she clearly didn't want.
3,Weird with a twist,"Paul Rudd plays a not so intelligent guy. I laughed a couple of times but this movie wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. You get all the funny parts in the preview. It does have a twist though, with a lesson to learn from pure, un-conditional love. It's ok if you have nothing else to watch, just don't expect much. I would rate it between a 2.5/3.0"
5,Loved It,"A good movie that turns ordinary stories into a funny, engaging, homey but not boring watch. I would recommend it!!"
2,"Quality Cast, Expected More","Just the title, ""Our Idiot Brother"" made me laugh. Combining that with a cast that I enjoy watching (Paul Rudd, Zooey Deschanel, Elizabeth Banks & Adam Scott), left me with some very high hopes. Unfortunately the movie didn't live up to those expectations.To me there's a difference between a movie and a film. Typically, I prefer movies to films as I don't have a vote for the Oscars so generally I enjoy being entertained. This movie, while certainly funny at times, felt more like a film to me. If you like being depressed, maybe you'll enjoy ""Our Idiot Brother""."
1,Unwatchable,"Personally, I don't think comedies should be filled with depressing, horrible characters. Couldn't even finish it. Even Paul Rudd couldn't save this.There needs to a be a NO STAR rating available, just for movies like this."
1,Worst Horrible,This movie was horrible! It was a waste of money. I do not recommend this to movie to anyone! Waste...
4,great and funny movie,we rented this move because of the trailer it was funny and a great movie.. .. .. .. .. ... ... ... ... ....
3,Good comedy,It was a good comedy. Typical laughs. I wouldn't rent it again but it is fun to watch once. Good for a group movie.
2,just ok..,"If your a fan of paul rudd and the gang you'll probably like it. But if your looking for a superbad or 40 year old virgin type movie than you'll be disappointed. It wasn't that funny. The acting and everything was fine, the story gave a good message. Women are miserable and a dog is definitely a man's best friend. Other then that the movie kinda of just dragged a long."
2,Zen and the Art of Underachievement,"I'm still waiting for this one to go somewhere. With a loaded cast and a simple, engaging direction, it's got the right pieces in place to build a sleepy, optimistic comedy about the nice guy (a very dude-like Paul Rudd) who almost always finishes last. Instead, it wastes most of its time egging on the self-centered, spoiled women around him, basking in the glow of their vapid, hollow lives while they carelessly take advantage of his somber situation. It's humorous at heart, if not particularly funny, and often steps away just as things seem to be about to turn the corner and erupt into wild chaos. The only thing more depressing than watching Rudd's poor, well-intentioned, passive hippie get repeatedly stomped into the mud is seeing how insufferably predictable the plot can become. A total paint-by-numbers watercolor job that doesn't seem to mean the happy message it throws up on-screen before the credits."
3,Could have been funnier,"After reading the synopsis, I expected this movie to be a good comedy, and yes, it did have some funny parts, but it was actually more about forgiving the lovable screw-ups that most of us have at least one of in the family. Which wasn't necessarily a bad thing, but it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I still thought it was a decent movie. It's kind of heartwarming, rather than outrageously funny."
5,wonderful!,"Not as much of a comedy as I thought it would be, but it is a great movie. More of a mix of comedy with a good message. Love it."
4,Awesome cast!,"What can i say about Paul Rudd.....good comedic actor!!! And what a cast!!!This movie is funny,but it also was warm without trying so hard."
4,Better than it looked,"My wife and I rented this on a rainy day. It was surprisingly good and moved along at a nice pace. The ""Idiot Brother"" has the innocence that we all would like but that we cannot have. A funny movie with some touching moments."
4,An Underlying Depth,"In ""Our Idiot Brother"" we see a man who is clearly a loser -- he's got long hair and a beard, he dresses like a bum, he has no job, he gets arrested selling pot to a cop (a cop who is wearing a police uniform!) -- and yet as we learn more about his three sisters who clearly have their lives more together, we realize the loser brother is kinder, more honest, more ethical, and more perceptive than everyone else. And his honesty and kindness helps people.The movie demonstrates that ""loserness"" depends on criteria that can be superficial or more meaningful.The movie reveals the superficiality of our normal, automatic judgments about people.It was gently and entertainingly uplifting.The reason I didn't give it five stars is that although there were several funny moments, it wasn't as funny as I expected (on the cover it says ""hilarious."""
4,Okay...needed more laughs,"Our Idiot Brother defiitely brought great family values to the table showing that everyone makes mistakes, however in that I expected a more comedic punch. Still, I did enjoy the movie and wasn't bored as I watched it. Some of the storylines were cliche and I was able to guess what would happen next."
2,Who are the Idiots?,"Is it the sisters and their co-dependency that enhances their brother's behavior?Everyone comes off as either stupid or, as befits the title, idiotic."
2,Lame and Contrived,There really isn't too much I want to say about Our Idiot Brother because I am already disappointed that I allowed it to take up any of my time. I kept waiting for it to get better but it didn't. I found it lame and contrived and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you got it as a freebie.
5,Worth mentioning,"I've never written a review before now, and this wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it was the first worth mentioning. If you want a feel-good kind of movie, this one is just the ticket! It was light-hearted and not too deep. Funny, witty, not bad acting...worth the $3.50."
3,Pretty good week night flick.,"I was just sitting around wanting to watch something and watched the trailer.. its pretty good. The trailer makes it pretty predictable but it was quirky and I liked it. Causal viewing, not something for crowd pleasing. Enjoy"
1,What a waste of time,"I cannot believe that there are so many good reviews on this movie! Paul Rudd does not even play the character that well. I mean is he supposed to be just a dumb pot head or a seriously mentally challenged person with a low IQ? He seems too articulate to be either, but what do I know. It isn't even funny one bit and I was shocked that a few good actors were in this and were not that good. Zoey being a die-hard lesbo was a shock and let down too but I guess I will get over it...lol. Seriously though, you could not pay me to own this idiotic movie. Wish I could have back those 90 or so minutes of my life. I would rather watch Warren Beatty's worst movie."
2,How long does it take to...,"How long does it take to state the obvious? ""...he loves the most unconditionally of anyone..."" Redundantly, annoyingly dysfunctional family that don't have enough depth to be interesting, except for Ned. But he wasn't that interesting to carry the whole thing,...(what does he think he's Tom Hanks or something?)"
2,wowee,"I have to say I was willing to give this movie a chance, what with many familiar faces and all, but after 45 minutes I could no longer take it! Besides the poor acting by, well, everyone, there is no real plot as far as I could tell.Granted, I quit after 45 minutes, but my tolerance of mediocre movies is low. Skip it."
3,3.5 (half for laughs),"Never judge a movie by the previews! I thought this was going to be a ridiculously funny movie. I was wrong. It did have it's moments. Paul Rudd was such an idiot that he really wasn't. Turns out the people (namely his sisters and an ex) were all idiots! Not a movie I would stand in line to see, but on Saturday, when there is nothing on..this will work!"
1,Dumbest movie I have seen in a long time,It started out bad and just got worse. Stupid humor. Couldn't even pretend it was funny. When the sexual three way with 2 men and 1 women started it was time to turn it off. The only thing worse than watching this movie would have been if I had of bought it instead of renting it!
2,Underwhelmed,Paul Rudd is yet another forgettable character in a comedy that goes nowhere--slowly. The plot wasn't that believable and it just wrapped up too neatly in the end.
3,Not as good as it could have been,"This movie started off really good. I thought it would be a black comedy, similar to Ghost World. But it very quickly went downhill. The characters were all very one-dimensional, and you don't feel much sympathy for them. Even in the special featurettes, the actors all seemed to be doing someone (the director, their friend) a favor by being in this movie. It had its moments, but overall, this movie is a pretty big waste of time. I love all the actors in it too, which makes it an even bigger shame that it turned out this way. It fell flat, seemed to be poking fun at caricatures of people who don't exist (very very stereotypical ""hippie"" characters and ""hot slutty lesbian""--I know, sounds great, right? WRONG). The alternate ending, included on the DVD, is WAY better than the one originally included. I am not sure why they cut it, but they should have it kept it, along with a small storyline showcasing Paul Rudd's character's kindness."
3,Review,"Decent movie with some good, light-hearted humor. Not a bad story either. It's worth seeing once or twice. Probably not more than that, though."
3,So-So...,"There's not really much to say about ""Our Idiot Brother"". I enjoyed the movie, but I could've waited until it was on tv. It wasn't laugh out loud funny, but there were a few sprinkles of hilarity. What you will take away from this movie is: the ""idiot"" brother is not really an idiot. He's just an honest, laid-back nice guy who coasts his way through life without a care in the world. Other adults who are so wrapped up in their busy lives are annoyed by him until they realize that they are the ones with the problems, and that he is actually a blessing to their lives.Overall, I do recommend watching ""Our Idiot Brother"", but you could always wait until it's on tv. It's not a ""must-see"" movie, but it's likable."
3,Probably wouldn't have worked at all with without Paul Rudd,"I really like Paul Rudd. Everything he does just seems to have a core of sincerity and humanity. Few other actors could have inhabited this character so genuinely and convincingly. The rest of the cast is fine, as well - not a surprise if you look at the names. It's a fun, uplifting movie."
4,LOVE IT - HATE IT,"Great fun and plenty of laughs. The cast saves the day with so much to hate and so much to love. The more I consider it, the dog ""Willie Nelson"" was great, as were Willie's songs. The kind-hearted guy should stay with farming and making candles - he will have a tough time in the real world. But now, he could move to Colorado, Washington or California and have a great career in producing medicine."
2,Not as funny As I thought It Would Be!,"I honestly thought this movie was going to be alot funnier! I was rather disappointed by the plot. I love Paul Rudd and his loveable character in this movie, but this movie lacked in so many areas. It lacked so much that I had to turn it off after about 40 minutes for I found it to be very boring and lacking the humor I thought it was going to have. I am just disappointed by this movie and expected way more!"
2,Our Idiot Brother,Not really a movie that we thought it would be and have no desire to watch it again. Not as funny as we thought it would be.
3,OK,Good characters and funny plot. Good overall story line too. Not awesome but overall good. Love the dog names and the hippie characters.
5,Funny!!!,Awesome Funny but serious movie about love life and drifters who love life!! I could easily watch this movie over & over.
5,Excellent product for my situation.,"This seems to be an excellent, well made, product. I used this to connect between a printer interface and an HP all-in-one printer. The connection on the interface was too big to fit in the limited space provided behind a door on the all-in-one. This cable did the trick and allowed me to use my exsisting printer."
1,Worse than one of SyFy's weekly bombs,If you enjoy watching movies about a group of people who run around a jungle shooting at something never seen then this movie was made for you. It has a camera crew traveling with a squad of soldiers on a mission to put in place some remote cameras that turns in an alien contact mission. As expected the soldiers have to tell the reporters to 'get down' and 'no lights' about a hundred times. The only bit about origins comes from a 40 second scene added on at the end.All in all a waste of time and money.
1,Not worth the money,I agree with every word that Karen said. This film leaves too much out to have any entertainment value. It is too repetitious and drags along. The actors were wasted on this film.
1,"One of the worst movies, EVER!","Don't waste your time in purchasing this movie. It is one of the most boring films, and the action doesn't come till the end of the movie."
5,Huge trance fan of Louie Devito and any other djs.,"This cd is awesome, its great for clubbing and parties, there are a few ones that were terribly mixed but most of all Louie did a great job on this NYC Album. I recommend this cd for anyone who has listened to the previous NYC Albums and liked them because this one is just as good as any other! I Hope Louie comes out with a 6th NYC, i cant wait untill he does."
2,Shame on you Louie!,"The much anticipated new mix from Louie was at the very least...disappointing! Being a fan of Louie for so many years, I can strongly say that this CD could have not emerged. For the sake of the club music fans everywhere, I believe they tried to pull a fast one on us. I agree with the previous writer who states that this CD should have been released early last year to be considered a hit. Sorry Louie, maybe next time you should wait until the music executives give the ""go ahead"" to mix new songs. The only one worth mentioning was IIO ""at the end"" and even then, the wrong mix was used.If at first you don't succeed, try, try, again!"
4,Nothing Special But still Good,"When i bought this cd i thought, it was gonna be mad nice but then when i heard the first few tracks it was getting boring and more boring..but some of the songs are allright.The mixing is okay but nothin special.I recommend the 3rd underground party much more then this.."
2,What Happened ? Stick to One CD,I have bought every Louie CD that he has brought out and the 4 previous I can say we fantastic not the deep Trance music but very good dance tracks mixed together with great artistry. Then 5 came out....two Cd's...oh well lets try it. Was very disappointed in Comparison to the last four ...terrible. On its own if you have never bought a Devito CD...pass on this one and buy 3 or 4 instead.
2,what happened...,"well, this series was going good until vol. 5 came out. these are nothing but recycled dance songs, and not the typical underground party style. i gave this cd 2 starts for the few good songs there are on this cd, such as madhouse's ""like a prayer"". if you want a good cd that is like the rest of the nyc underground party series, go for ""provocative trance"" by chris cox."
1,Bogus..,"Louie DeVito's old stuff was allright, but now he really just sucks. I don't know if it's just him or the fact that they don't make techno like they used to."
1,Not worth the money,I have been continually disappointed with everything Devito has produced since Vol. 3 and this is no exception. Songs are too slow and I found myself skipping through many of the songs with the hope that the next one would be better.......didn't happen. Boring....
1,Those who can't produce - license.,"Louie Devito [stinks]. He can't produce his own music so he has to make money licensing and compiling others. As far as his mixes go, let's hope those software manufacturers keep those auto-beat mixing programs in good supply!"
1,very dissapointed,"This CD absolutely sucks. There are maybe about seven songs out of the whole 28 that i will actually listen too. i dont know what happened, i have volumes 3 and 4 and they are the best Cd's out of my whole collection of electronic music. As being a big fan of Louie Devito he betterpick out some better songs. I dont know about anybody else but i like pure techno and trance on mmy cd's. Not stupid pop songs and old Madonna remakes."
3,Could be better !!,"I have a lot to say about this album, but all I am going to say is ONE DISC. This would be the best one of the series if you take a select few songs from both discs and put them on one. Louie you tried to hard this time, less is more. A big fan of Louie Devito"
3,Wait this one out,"This has a couple of good dance songs on it that you are likely to hear at a club. If you can get over the cheese of L'Italiano...There are a couple of good underground hits, but a lot of radio stuff. I probably would not have bought it if I had heard it from a friend first. There are a lot of repeat songs that are found on other current DJ Cd's so read the track listings before you buy."
4,Almost Five Stars,"It loses points because there are more filler tracks than great ones. More specifically, 9 out of 28 tracks are good. Some of them are so good that I had to give this double album at least a 4. Overall, not a must have, but if you like this type of music, it might be worth a purchase."
4,Great CD,"Awesome CD. The compilation of songs are great although I think the second CD has better songs on it. This is the kind of CD you could put on at a party and not have to constantly change CD's for the best songs. Overall, a good choice for a dance music fan."
1,Louie Devito,He's cd is pretty good but he isn't. I seen him on that dating show if anyone else has and he was a complete jerk. He only cares about his money.Very rude. But the music is pretty good but isn't all that.
4,Good lamp,"This is a good lamp. I wish it had a longer gooseneck, say another 8-10"" which would require a stronger clamp or another method of attachment to the desk. Overall however, it is a very good lamp!"
5,A great gift,"I bought this for a housewarming gift for a single female friend who has little background in home repair, but eager to learn. She has already found it helpful for the ""basics"" as well as to get her thinking about the future things she hopes to tackle."
4,Dare to Repair,"This book is excellent for taking care of everyday repairs by those who never took ""Shop,"" and who are not talented or particularly knowledgeable in mechanics or electronics."
5,A Very Empowering Book,"I bought this book for my Mom for Christmas last year. She was on her own for the first time in her life. When I visited her this Christmas, she was complaining about her toilet running. I said, ""Mom, get the book"" She got the book out, I read the instructions out loud to her, and she fixed her OWN toilet. She was so proud of herself. Everyone that called on Christmas got the blow by blow account of how she fixed her own toilet. Buy this book. You will learn how to fix alot of those annoying household problems. Save money, and get a feeling of accomplishment. Buy it for your Mom, Dad, everyone. Highly recommended!"
2,prefer reader's digest book,"I didn't find that there was enough basic information in this book to be useful to me. I think the author is trying to make money off of the ""concept"" rather than provide lots of informative information. And I admit, I was lured into the ""concept"" and bought the book, with much disapointment.For me the 1001 Do It Yourself hints & tips by reader's digest is more comprehensive with 100x more information than this book. In addition, the reader's digest books is geared towards ANYONE, because this is information that everyone needs for their first home, not just ""women"". In the reader's digest book you learn about plumbing basics, how to deal with kitchen fires, leaks and everything inbetween. (You can preview the book on Amazon too!)"
3,why so saccharine?,"So this seems like a great repair book, well written instructions and good design layout, but why does each repair have to be introduced with some cutesy story? Just the information please, I don't want to hear about some pregnant woman's problem with the running toilet! Too bad, as it distracts from the good information in the book."
3,Very basic repairs,"I am a man, but not really versed into doing household repairs.This book is very basic, the basic of the basics.It teaches you how to open a garage port,or how to turn on a blown fuse,but not on how to mount a luster, or lamp, or how to fix a door that's stuck.This book is truly for women, or men without any knowledge whatsoever.If you kind of know how to change a fuse from the electrical board, or tighten a leaking faucet, or drill a hole in the walls to hang up a portrait, then this book is not for you, and you will do better with a more advanced book!"
4,an excellent book for an excellent price,i bought this for my sister who is in a 'women in construction' vocational program and is learning all about fix-it-ups. she really loved it and i'd definitely say this book makes a great gift! 4 stars!
3,"Not bad, but not from here","I enjoyed this book as a gift and purchased a couple recently from Amazon to give as gifts, but they are in no condition to give to anyone. The copies I received are pretty torn up. Would be okay if you are buying for yourself, but the covers are way too messed up to gift."
3,To basic,"If you know absolutely nothing about basic repairs this is a book is a good starting point. If you have the ability to change a light bulb, spackle a wall, hang a piture, you probably will also find this book fairly useless."
5,Good Companion book...for The Idiots Book of Home Repair,Between the two books I think I could pretty well fix anything at all if I had the tools... I could open a business ....grat to have around..
3,Dare to Repair Review,"The book is helpful, but just when I think it's going to explain in further detail, they move on to the next problem. I was hoping for more detail. I guess it's a little too simplified for me."
1,Stay away,This book is shallow and terrible. I would not recommend it. It covers a wide area but does not go into sufficient details. Mile wide inch deep.
4,where is mayo,where the hell is mayonaise if this is a greatest hits album screw landslide its not even their song
4,"No Mayonnaise, Rockets and Thirty-Three","Great CD for SP hardcore fans. Little disappoint that there's no song like Mayonnaise, Rockets, and thirty-three"
1,"where is mayo, some greatest hits album this is",The title says it all with out mayonaise on any greatest hits album by the pumpkin there is nothing great about it. Landslide come on that is not even their song and all of cd 2 blows so there is nothing great about this billy grow your hair back and go find your little bass player and put out some rock music.
5,Chris Z. Mouzakitis,"I was completely suprised when this album came out. The Pumpkins had been broken up for a while and I thought i would never hear Billy Corgan's great voice again. Even though I already own every song on this collection other than the unrealeased ones it was still very much worth it. I recomend this album for people who want to get into the Smashing Pumpkins, plus if you get the limited editon, you get a bonus disk filled with B-Sides and other cool stuff, which as a hardcore fan I found to be cool. If you already have The Aeroplane Flies High Box Set then some of B-Sides aren't new to you but some of the other ones I have never even heard so it evens itself out. The only complaint I have is that they should have put some songs that weren't radio hits like 33, Bodies,Age of Innocence, and other great songs on it. A must buy for the Hardcore Pumpkins Fan or someone who just wants to get into the Pumpkins."
3,Wow!!!!,"I can tell you some of my favorite's are missing: Muzzle, I am One,Crestfallen, Try,Try,Try , Rocket. I know it dosn't sound like a lot but if they had put in all the greatest songs it would have gone like this.1. I am One2. Siva3. Rhinocerous4. Tresessa5. Drown6. Cherub Rock7. Rocket8. Disarm9. Today10. Mayo11. Geek U.S.A.12. Bullet with Butterfly Wings12. Tonight, Tonight13. Zero14. Muzzle15. 33 (Why is this missing this was a huge hit)16. 197917. JellyBelly18. Here is No WhyDisk 21. In the Arms of Sleep2. Crestfallen3. Perfect4. Ava Adore5. Daphne Descends6. The Everlasting Gaze7. Try, Try, Try8. Stand Inside Your Love9. I of the Morning"
4,A Must For All Rock Fans,"Back in 1995 The Smashing Pumpkins appeared on The Simpsons with 'Zero' and the first thing i did was download it and other songs, and i have about 30 songs by them on my computer. This year i saw 'Greatest Hits' and instantly bought it, it is a classic CD with great songs like 'Siva', 'Zero' and lots of unrealesed songs. It also includes a secound CD which is absolute music heaven, if you like one of their songs buy this."
4,a must have,"If you are a fan of this genre of music, this album is a must have for your music collection."
5,My son wanted this.,He is thrilled with this cd. He said he always liked the songs and now he can play them daily.
4,If you want to feel melancholoy...,"I was looking forward to this Greatest Hits compulation, and I wasn't really dissappointed. The cd basically has most of the songs you'd expect to be on it. One song it really missed out on was ""Mayonnaise"", a song i personally love. As for Judas O, when i first popped it in, i thought something was wrong with my speakers. It kinda sounds like they recorded this cd in a cheap studio, b/c the quality of the sound isn't all that great. Maybe that was the point of making the cd looking like a cd-r. That's my only complaint with that, because it was like a little extra thrown in to accomodate the GH cd. and you'll definetely find some songs to your liking on it as well. Smashing pumpkins, a legend."
4,A smashing success,"It's the best of one of the 90's most influential bands, all on one affordable CD. The music easily stands up to what's on the radio today. Very listenable."
5,Classic Pumpkins!,"This album is a culmination of all things good of Smashing Pumpkins. All these tunes are a transition of the evolution of Smashing Pumpkins distinctive musical tone, mood and style. You will not be disappointed."
4,Not so rotten apples,"just bought this cd and i am very impressed...all my favorites on one cd!!! like any hard-core fan, i cried for 2 weeks when they broke up....but that's beside the point. this cd is a must-have for any true pumpkins fan. this is one album that definitely should NOT be named rotten....it's one of the greatest pumpkins collections i've heard in a long time and i recommend it for any die-hard fan."
4,"Great compilation, but here's what should have been:","1. I Am One2. Siva3. Drown4. Cherub Rock5. Today6. Rocket7. Disarm8. Landslide9. Bullet With Butterfly Wings10. 197911. Zero12. Tonight, Tonight13. Thirty-Three14. Eye15. The End Is The Beginning Is The End16. Ava Adore17. Perfect18. Stand Inside Your Love19. The Everlasting Gaze"
4,"Especially Enjoy Listening to ""1979""","I recently heard ""1979"" on the radio. I discovered it was recorded by this particular group. I bought the CD specifically for that song. The other pieces are not within my music genre. I plan to give the CD to a family member for his 90's music collection."
3,decent Pumpkins compilation,"There aren't that many Pumpkins albums, you might as well purchase them all and listen to them instead of listening to this poor track selection. The worst of the track selections is Landslide. This album is for the person who has absolutely no Pumpkins listening experience and does not own one of their albums."
4,Odds and Sods for The Alt Rock generation,"The first disc Rotten Apples is one of those discs where every song is a keeper. From the beautiful ""Disarm"" to the angst ridden""Zero"" to the 2 new songs to even a cover of ""Landslide"", all in all a five star disc. One minor complaint:the before the fact tribute to Jonathan Melvoin ""Thirty-Three"" and maybe a couple of additional songs from ""Siamese Dream"" like ""Luna"" or ""Spaceboy"".Disc 2(Judas O) is a bunch of unreleased songs somewhat uneven but with many choice cuts,tops among them being the B-Side ""Aeroplane Flies high"" and a searing cover of the David Essex chestnut ""Rock On""."
3,"CD 1 is good, CD 2 is like Machina II","Disc one is very nice because it contains many of the songs I listen to on a regular basis. ""untitled"" is supposed to be Corgan's last SP song, so when I read about this one on the 'net, it made this album that much more provocative, especially since Machina II was supposed to be ""it"" for the band.Disc two I did not care for too much, as much of it is already on the Machina II 'net release. It does have a rather cool version of ""Saturnine"", which happens to be one of my favorites from Machina II. Otherwise, this particular disc just sounds like a re-hash of music you can get for free anyway."
5,All the Pumpkins best songs can be found here...,"This is a great collection of the Smashing Pumpkins work. It has some great early songs such as ""Siva"" and ""Rhinoceros"" (both off their debut CD Gish) and a few off their best CD Siamese Dream. ""Cherub Rock"" and ""Disarm"" are my favorites off that one. ""Landslide"" is a neat cover of an old Fleetwood Mac tune and that originally appeared on their B-sides collection. You also get 4 songs off their double album Mellon Collie & The Infinite Sadness, ""Tonight Tonight"" is my favorite from that bunch. Their later stuff is pretty good too. Definately worth checking out..."
5,Excelllent Pumpkin Compilation,"Great compilations of songs, my wife give it to me on the last Christmastime and i really enjoy my alone driving back to TJ. I always liked the smashing pumpkins mostly the firsts albums, but i never had bought any of them, this CD fulfill with all my expectations. Great Buy"
1,Get the bonus disk,"This CD is nothing compared to the bonus cd that came with it, called ""Judas O"". They are like A sides and B sides. It features a shorter version of Aeroplane Flies High (Turns Left, Looks Right) which doesn't include the high pitched noise ending. I don't think of it as a greatest hits album because it doesn't have ""Ugly"" or ""Mouths Of Babes"" from ""The Aeroplane Flies High"" Boxed set, or tracks like ""The End Is The Beginning Is The End"". You may want to get this one just to update the sound quality of the tracks you already have. For instance, this set was produced in 2001 and the track called ""Eye"" was produced back in 1996."
1,EDITED???,"Is anyone elses Rotten Apples cd edited?I was visiting my local Walmart and saw this album there. I was about to buy it when I noticed that it said (EDITED) on the top of the cd case. So I ended up not buying it there, and decided to check here on Amazon. I found it and was excited because it didn't say anything about being edited. So I bought it, but when it arrived in the mail...it was...EDITED!!!The Pumpkins are great and this album deserves a 5 star rating, but not in an edited form. I hope that Amazon will return my item or let me exchange it for an unedited one or a different album."
1,where's the love?,"Where is 33? I'm actually pretty satisfied with thier compelation of songs,but it can't be called a greatest hits if it does't have all the hits! There are 2 songs off of the Batman & Robin soundtrack that should've made it to this cd. However, they were not there. All in all this cd is a must buy, but without all the hits, it can only have one star from this critic."
1,Vegetables in the moonlight,"Lets start with Track 4, who augments a 3 chord? A diminished 2nd would have worked much better, or at least a 5th. I feel like i'm in preschool music theory class when i listen to the CD. They weren't even advanced enough to use a compound meter. This makes ""Chopsticks"" look like a masterpiece. They grow like a malignant vegetable in the darkness. Just as a child must eat its vegetables, one must forcefully listen to this CD. Consequently, a child is punished while they wait for the sun to go down with only vegetables remaining on their platter. Scars. I praythee, do not give your olfactory lobe smell the stench of those rotten vegetables.In conclusion, are you still reading this? Go listen to the music of the Goodbones. Dance. Sing. Live...in the moonlight?"
3,Not the pumpkins at their best,"This is Smashing Pumpkins greatest hits. I would rather call it ""Smashing Pumpkins Most Popular Hits"" as it is not really thier best ones, just the ones that were the most popular. If you are buying this for the 2nd CD (the B-Sides CD), its not worth it. I only liked the first 5 songs on the B-sides CD. If you are new to the Pumpkins i recommend ""Siamese Dreams"" as that is truly Smashing Pumpkins at their best."
5,allinone,"Having all these hits packed into one place, reminds me why i feel in love with the often slacked upon Pumpkins. they truly do rock out and in the next chord make you tear up. beautiful"
3,Half the story at best,"I recommend the greatest hits album only to those who would like to get into the pumpkins, and not as a must for pumpkins fans. greatest hits albums just sort of tell which songs you should enjoy rather then let you experience an album from start to finish. If the pumpkins wanted us to experiece these songs the way they are layed out on this c.d, they would've released them that way to begin with. I say buy their albums and draw your own conclusions about their ""greatest hits"". I know this c.d doesn't even pick half the songs that I would pick. That is only my opinion. Buy their albums and figure out yours."
5,Some of their best songs...plus another 70 minutes free,"Like everyone, I'm extremly happy that The Smashing Pumpkins released Judas O along with this excellent set of well known songs.The Rotten Apples portion of the set has all the singles you've come to know and love, but I'm surprised to see a couple songs on here that I'm not sure were released as singles. Landslide and Eye come to mind. In one sitting it's very intresting to hear their progression from Gish's indie grunge feel to Adore's allmost synth pop to MACHINA's art rock. Plus the unreleased song ""Untitled"" is simply amazing and worth the price alone. On The b-sides disc I found several great songs, Saturnine is amazing along with a couple others.A great buy if your already a Pumpkins fan and a great buy if your just getting into them."
4,An excellent source on sharks,"A very entertaining story as well as a lot of information on sharks. A true ""The Magic School Bus"" book."
3,It's ok,"It's ok, and I do mean just ok. It's not great and it's not horrible. I gave it 3 stars based on the fact that it's kind of flimsy. It needs some type of support or a heavier gauge metal for the screen as it tends to sag. Other than that it's fine. It was the only screen top I could find for my size tank."
4,Great screen top,I needed this screen top for my 55gal tank that holds my escape prone 4 1/2ft ball python...the old zilla screen had finally bit the dust. The screen works fine as long as you dont have too much weight on top - they dont make them as strong as they used to.
5,Strong as Fits Perfect,I was not really expecting this item to be as good as it is. It is solid fits snug and does the job well!.
4,Perfect,"fits my 50 gal tank perfectly! fits just right, not to tight or too big, but the wire mesh is a little flimsily."
4,Fits perfectly,I was nervous getting something like thus online but it fits perfect on out forty gallon tank. It came packaged fine and in perfect shape.
5,Music at its best,"No matter whether you enjoy the heavy vocals on this cd or not, you can't overlook the music. this band is full of brilliant musicians, and the songs will pull you in and make you listen to them over and over.tide in mind out and the bio approach are highlights."
2,"Interesting, Even Good, but Not an Original Paradigm","On first listen of ""Organasm"", the band that instantly comes to mind is Neurosis, the avant-garde Bay area band that pioneered the sound that is shamelessly ripped off here by Alchemist. I would urge the reader to purchase Neurosis' ""Souls at Zero,"" ""Enemy of the Sun,"" and ""Through Silver in Blood"" and listen to them in continuous succession. It is a cathartic experience unmatched by any band I have heard yet."
3,"OK, but hardly complete","What's here is good material. It lists a fair range of terms used in art on paper, with many reproductions of art showing the effects of different tools or materials. The book itself if well printed, on heavy paper that shows the sample artworks very clearly. And, as a parting benefit, it offers a helpful bibliography.It's what's not here that's the problem. A book twice this size might have been adequate for either drawing or watercolor, and a printmaking would have needed a lot more than that by itself. What's here is good, but possibly not enough to justify this book for most collections.-- wiredweird"
4,'tea time',This is an attractive coffee table book that is an interesting light reading book on the subject of tea. The pictures are great but the book could be greatly improved if was more detailed in terms of its content.
1,The 'Real' Shadows,"Really disappointed to have my time wasted by pathetic and unethical use of the name of a really professional group now disbanded but always remembered as a tremendously talented, and who gave us so much good music. I find this kind of promotion not only dubious but extremely annoying when seeking original artists material."
1,Johnny Lee Clary didn't write this book!,Johnny Lee Clary is currently associated with Jimmy Swaggart Ministries. He closed their 2012 Thanksgiving Campmeeting by giving his personal and powerful testimony. He's also a regular panelist on Frances and Friends. Someone asked him about this book. He said that it was actually written by a ghostwriter. His original manuscript got rejected. He had to hire a lawyer. He's working on his own book now.
1,Junk,"I thought this was going to be a good biography from what I have heard about this man. But I was wrong. Yes he converted from a Klan member to a Christian. So what? So have many others. I don't see them bragging about it. Johnny Lee Clary is an opportunist, using his past as way to make money. He is too lazy to go out and get a job like normal people."
3,Lincoln's Melancholy,"As a mental health professional, I was interested in Lincoln's mental state and how it affected his political life and personal relations."
4,Lincoln's Mercury poisoning.,"Lincon's Melancholy is a great book which consists of seven years of research by its author. It was amazing to learn that Lincoln was consuming ""blue mass"" pills during his presidency for his health, when all it was likely doing was causing him to have chronic depression because the pills consisted of pure ground mercury."
3,Something is Missing,"This is a great story about an aspect of Lincoln's life that is rarely discussed, but something was missing. It read like the author was under contract to crank out a book about Lincoln's depression, and he put off writing it until three month before his deadline. I expected a lot more, but it was still worth reading."
3,"Dry at first, but fascinating toward the end","Very hard to get into, but fascinating after the first 100 pages or so. This book was researched extensively and explores the way Lincoln's upbringing and depression made him perservere in the face of daunting challenges.This book made me want to read more about Lincoln and especially about his wife Mary Todd Lincoln."
5,Lincolin' Melancholy :How Depression Challenged a President & Fueled His Greatness,This book was very interesting. You learn alot about what Lincolin went through and about depression. Depressiom is a terrible illness and by reading this book you can see what it does to a person. Lincolin was a great man and are lucky we had him as a president.
1,Horrible reading,"I made it through one disc then gave up. The best audiobook readers are unobtrusive--they don't get in the way of the text. The reader on this audiobook is one of the worst I've heard. His articulation is so annoyingly idiosyncratic--now fast, now slow, now this emphasized, now that, now a folksy, cracker-barrel intonation, now a pretentious psycho-babble ""authoritative"" voice--that I was continuously distracted from the text. He's almost as bad as the dreadful Nelson Runger, who ruined David Hackett Fischer's ""Washington's Crossing"" for me with his ridiculous ""Sargeant Schultz""-style German accents for Hessian soldiers."
3,Another brush stroke in the picture of Dorian Grey,"I liked this book well enough. The ""greatness"" thesis , however, is not convincing. We need to be able to point out the problems without resorting to the old litany. Idealization (""mythologizing"") is not absolutely required anymore. A reader should supplement this volume with Manber's LINCOLN'S WRATH and DiLorenzo's masterful THE REAL LINCOLN, now easily available in paperback."
3,i couldn't get into it.,I was excited to start this book after hearing good things about it but only ended up getting through about half. Seems redundant and overwritten.
4,Learned to know Lincoln,"This book provides a personal insight into Lincoln: his developing understanding of himself, his great hopes for a useful life, and the challenges he overcame. Our appreciation for Lincoln grew."
3,Lincoln's Melancholy,"A well-researched book, with lots of factual information. While I enjoyed the book, I thought it was a bit ""heavy"" and tedious at times. The author seems so intent on proving that Lincoln suffered from depression that some of his evidence seems a bit overworked.Overall, though, a good addition to the voluminous material being written about a very, very great American."
4,Insightful & Inspiring,"Lincoln was a lawyer with a mental illness; I am almost a lawyer and certainly have major depression and anxiety disorder NOS. The reason I am only almost a lawyer is because I earned my J.D., passed the bar exam on the first try, only to be denied admission because of a negative recommendation on my character and fitness examination because of my mental health issues. Obviously, this book was incredibly inspiring to me in this very dark period of my life and gave me the desire to persevere as Lincoln had. Direct quotes from the writings of Lincoln, as well as commentary from a variety of psychologists and other scholars were the most insightful passages of the book. However, I must admit that I skimmed some of the date heavy history passages. Pick up this book; I can assure you that you will feel some degree of emotional connection to Lincoln when finished."
5,Lincoln's Melacholy is My Joy,"Lincoln's Melancholy, by promising young scholar Joshua Wolf Shenk, brings a fresh, human perspective to the great Lincoln we all knew and loved, in a distant way, back in history classes of yore. Best about the book? It shows that depression, which we all go through to some extent or other, is not to be suppressed, or feared--but rather grappled with and, even, embraced. And so Mr. Shenk ably shows how Lincoln's well-documented but largely forgotten experiences with depression became the source of his great reservoirs of strength over the course of the War Between the States. His experiences with depression also became the source of his empathy, his humor, his ability to feel and experience life fully. And so Mr. Shenk's novel approach knocks other historical biographies out of the park--he goes way beyond, or beneath, dates and names and places...to what it's all about: our human experience."
5,A Different Approach: More Psychology than Politics,"While Lincoln is the focal point in this book, the work also looks at his friends, family members, and other creative writers: Herman Melville, to name one. This is a history book yet covers the history of psychology in early America rather than just politics or military campaigns. A very interesting read!"
5,An uniquely insightful look into the mind of our greatest President,"Let me start by saying that this book does not attempt to present a complete history or biography of Lincoln's life. Ideally, the reader should already be familiar with Lincoln's biography (David Herbert Donald's ""Lincoln"" would be a great preface). That having been said, this book approaches Lincoln's life and character from a new perspective and provides insight and well-considered re-examination of facts that cannot be found elsewhere. Wolf Shenk's scholarship is absolutely first rate, and his understanding of the subject matter - both Abraham Lincoln and the psychology of depression - is intimate and accurate. The afterword, ""What Everybody Knows"" is one of the most interesting parts of the book- don't skip over it. A groundbreaking, first rate piece of work which is also an engaging read.Bravo, Joshua Wolf Shenk!"
5,"Guitar Note Speller,The Musician's Friend","If this ole cowboy with all the hits and kicks to the head he's gotten can learn to read music and ""remember"" guitar fret positions,trust me you can too !"
4,A Hot Mix,I gotta say it's not one of those usual boring mix cd's released every week. It's something new and fresh to listen to whether ur just driving in the car or at a big party.
5,A very good mix,This is good mix cd with a lot of very good songs. A must have for you dance/club collection or for any dj(like me).
1,reader beware,"If black and white photos of english lakes,the author, and dead trout are to your liking, and if you want to read monotonous chapters on new ways of casting a fly, selecting a fly rod , and obscure patterns are to your likeing this may be a great book.There is very little, if anything on the biology of Brown trout, any insights on their feeding patterns or habits, or habitat preferences of the brown trout.Compared to the writings of Art Flick, Steve Raymond, of Gary Lafontaine this book is abyssmal."
5,Great laughs at yesteryear,"The hilarious Rifftrax crew do it again with some really odd shorts. One of the funniest things about these were their function: were they meant for educational purposes? informing the unsuspecting public? or a way to distract the students while the teachers snuck away for a wee nip or nicotine fix? It's a real blast to see the 50s family unit in 'What it Means to Be an American', the correct proper dating guidelines in 'Going Steady' and two double creature features in 'A Circus Wakes Up' and 'Wing Claw & Fang'. You can never go wrong with social deviance as demonstrated in 'Teenagers on Trial' or the female power brigade of 'Women in Blue'. However, the topper for me is the strange twilight zonish, drivers ed short of the risk of becoming another accident fatality in 'Highway Mania'. This is just an example of what Rifftrax does best."
4,History of history of the business of tobacco -,"The book is a recounting of the history of one of the oldest and most influential tobacco companies in history. Engagingly written, factual, and promotional. Numerous period advertising appearing towards the end of the work promote ""Old Gold"" cigarettes. Well illustrated with vignettes, engravings and pages of color plates showing tobacco cards put out by Lorillard over the years including ""Old Gold"" ""Beechnut"" ""Briggs"", etc."
4,Very good,"Verry light, still very powerful, but not as powerful as the microgel 125. Delivered quickly. Perfect."
5,accurate powerfull and strong.,i bought this as a backup as i already have a flexpoint.its very powerful and also very accurate.i have also hit the wall many times with it and its still holding on.i recommend this racket to every player.
2,Christain Hum Drum,"When I saw the cover, I said, "" I have to get this CD!"" When I listened to the entire CD, that was a different story. It was a big disapointment! There is so much Christian talent out today and Christian musical styles that should have been implimented in this CD. It was a shame to compile a CD that sounded the same from start to finish. I admit there were a couple of good songs. But, 2 out of 30 is not good at all! When I buy WOW, I expect WOW, not hog wash! This CD didn't rock at all."
2,disapointment,"I was pretty disapointed with this CD. Most of the time I look forward to my yearly installtion of christian rock. But this one had more Pop music than rock and that annoyed me. There were a few of the songs I liked, mainly on the gold disk, like Breathe by Micheal W Smith and Welcome Home by Shaun Groves.As I prefer rock to pop or slower songs, having my favourite songs on this cd being slower ones, I was rather disapointed."
5,Contemporary,"If you are into contemporary Christian music, then this cd is for you, because it has it all. It's a mix of pop, r&b and so much more. enjoy it, cause it's great!!!"
4,WOW what a great CD,"I'm a little surprised to see all the negative reviews out there - cause I just purchased this CD the other day, and I think it's absolutely fantastic.WOW have really done a good job this year with their selection of music - but admittedly it could have been even better had they included a few more rock tracks. It would have been nice to see something included by Jars of Clay or Delirious.None the less there are some great songs included here: some of my faves include ""Somebody's watching"" - Tobymac, ""Existence"" - Kevin Max, and ""Hey Hey"" - The Elms. On the gold disk I really like ""Watching Over Me"" - FFH, and ""We Delight"" by Caedmon's Call.There are some other great songs as well - and some surprises too. This is what I like about WOW CDS - The variety. WOW 2002 provides a good mix of Pop, Adult Contemporary, Rock, and Inspirational sounds.Those who have a broad taste in music, and don't just like only one kind will really enjoy and appreciate WOW 2002."
1,Disaster in Disguise,"Judging by the history of WOW CD's and my first encounter with WOW 98, I was quite impressed with the quality, selection of songs and it's arrangement. I have since seen this standard droped but this one is an absolute disaster. I wish I could have my money back because this is not worth paying a penny for. There were 2 or 3 songs in there that are manageable, I 'll say who ever compiled the videos has bad taste. This is the 1st WOW DVD that I know of and one would expect it to be an absolute hit rather it is the opposite. It feels like the whole compilation was made in a haste without considering the different audience that it attract. Most of the songs are rock like artist, surely 2 would be Ok but not to the tune of 5 or 6. Unless the copies on sale can be withdrawn and another one WOW produced with new songs (which I know will not happen, I 'll not say thank you if you gave WOW Hits 2002 to me as a gift."
1,Extremely bad,If the people at WOW want us to buy the c.d.'s they should put some good music on it. not just pop and pre-released crap. if the reveiw thing had an option of rating it 0 that's what it would be.
2,Get's worse every year!`,"Wows just keep getting worse every year, but I'll always keep buying them.When's the next one out?"
3,"Great, but really needs more variety!","First of all I love music more than anyone I know my age, and I am a big fan of WoW. I buy every wow cd(except gospel and worship) right when it hits the stores. My favorite was WoW 1999, because it had variety. There were worship songs, pop, rock songs, soft, light songs, i think even some gospel. But slowly they got less and less variety. WoW 2000 was pretty good, WoW 2001 kept me occupied a while but this- It's just-bleh. This just doesn't have variety. But it isn't terrible however. There are some good songs. Such 3rd day's 40 days traditional ""40 days"", AudioA's funky ""Beautiful"", toby's ""Somebody's Watching"", ""Existence"" by KMax, ""Breathe"" by Micheal W. Smith, and ""Hey, Hey"" by The Elms.All in all, this is just you're average double-disk various artists cd. Try finding it on ebay, 'cause it's more worth 15 or 16 bucks than 20. Hopefully they've discovered they're problem and'll fix it on WoW 2003. But I'm not giving up on them yet..."
4,"Good mix, but I don't like the second CD","I like this CD for, basically, the first CD with Newsboys, Kevin Max, and such...but the second CD didn't have much great music on it. Worth buying tho'."
1,You'll need a magnifying glass,I never thought to check the dimensions of any book before I bought it. I should have with this one.
3,Nice but not spectacular,"This nice little book fits in the palm of your hand. It's interesting, but more of a novelty item than anything else."
1,'minature edition' ??,"I when I ordered this, I could not tell that this was one of those tiny friggin gift books. I do see where it says 'miniature' but that can be interpreted in different ways. I really thought I was purchasing a book that was at least 4x6 -5x7 inches big. This think is more like 1 x 2 inches big.If you are into TINY books, then you will enjoy this."
1,Threw it away,"This cracks, peels, and when I try to apply more to cover up the cracky peely parts, it ends up looking like I'm painting over cracked plaster. I threw it away because it just doesn't look good and doesn't last in a smooth finish. Trying to take off the parts that remain is horrific; I could use sandpaper to get it off and still have a rough time. It is strange that it lasts in some places on my lips and not others, and gets a cracked finish even with frequent applications of the gloss that comes with it. I wont buy this product again."
4,"Some ""dated"" info, but interesting reading","Some of the information regarding the names and condition of roads leading to the ghost towns is out of date, hence a check on current conditions is advised before traveling to these sites. However the background info and personal experiences of the author make interesting reading"
4,A haunted man remembers.,A story told from a side not usually heard. While the book is told from a semi-fictional point of view you can clearly feel the emotion of the author. I felt as if the writing of this book was a way to chase away the demons that must have haunted him these many years. The author allows the reader to feel the emotions and even shame that the innocent german people felt when they discovered the horrors that were being committed by Hitler and his storm troopers. Claus Hackenberger reminds us how easy it is to fool large portions of our world. This must not happen again.
5,"The ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" of WW2","Why is this book not better known? I read several books a month and have read many on WW2. This book is incredible! A truley profound anti-war novel! You could just feel the true emotion of Paul as he went thru all of his experiences before, during, and after WW2. His description of his relationship with his father & mother and how the war made him bitter was so well done.Anyone who wants to gain insight into the German was pysche before WW2 and the plight of ordinary, non-Nazis, after the war, should read this. There is also interesting historical facts included in the book and it was fascinating to hear first-hand to what became to many German POWs in the years after the war."
4,For the tobacco and pipe smoking fancier,"This book covers Pipes, Cigars, Cigarettes, How to Buy a pipe, How to blend Tobacco, How to smoke a cigar and the care of tobacco products."
2,6th Edition Much Better,"Thought I could save $100 by getting this 5th edition, plus Casenotes for the 6th, not the 6th edition textbook as required. But ended up seeing that there was enough of a difference that I was losing much of the substance of the course as taught, and needed to get the required edition. Happily also found that the 6th edition, in addition to having about 10-15% newer cases, that with slightly larger print, better page contrast, etc. it seems much easier to read, and appears to have concepts more clearly organized/spelled out.From other reviews it seems this Dobbs book is not the easiest choice for organizing thoughts and learning tort rules.But if it's Dobbs that your course requires, get the newer edition, not this one. I actually have found the 6th to be a pretty decent textbook."
1,Worst Torts book ever,"I used this book during my first year of law school and found it utterly useless. Aside from the terrible editing, the material is not all that well organized and the book is full of little ""mini-cases"" which present you with random little holdings of tort law. Furthermore, I found the analysis on some of the more important cases to be deficient."
3,NOT HOT,I was expecting much more. It seems like the author went to a FEW locations around the world and shot photos within a block. I was hoping for something a lot more. I was disappointed and would not really recommend it. All of these books suffer from the same bunch of blahs. Nothing exceptional here. Check it out at the local library first and then decide. There are a lot of very beautiful idea books out there this is not one of them.
5,Teacher Stamps,My daughter was a beginning teacher and was looking for anything that made her life a little easier. These stamps really helped her with marking student work.
4,Teacher Stampes,I love these stamps. The only complaints I have is that the box was slightly warped when it arrived and that the stamps were a little smaller than I expected.
2,Only half of them work...,"The other half do not stamp completely enough to be read by the kids. It's a shame, too. I really like the wide variety of feedback they contain."
1,Completely wrong edition,"The product I ordered was the original edition of Dr. Benjamin Spock's 1946 ""Common Sense book of baby and child care."" The product I received is the much less exciting 1976 revised edition of the book. I am HUGELY disappointed. I specifically need the 1946 copy and was thrilled to find out that it was available for such a reasonable price. Original copies are not easy to come by, and as a historian, edition dates matter. I won't return this book because it's too much of a hassle, but I would never have purposely bought this edition. FALSE advertising. You should make sure your products match what Amazon is advertising them as. THUMBS DOWN!"
2,It is a little too easy for somone who has already taken some ballet classes,I didn't like it very much. It was VERY BASIC. I do not recomend this for someone who is trying to 'learn on their own'. I didn't feel like i was really learning anything new with it. But if someone is just starting out i think this would be great!
1,rotten beef,Dont buy. I love the Captain. Between the studio releases and live releases I'm up to sixteen CDs of CB. I found this for 89 cents (plus shipping) and it was barely worth the $3.87 The sound quality is terrible. The performance is mostly mediocre to poor with a few really good moments. If you find it for 89 cents and you're obsessive about Don then its okay. For anything more than a buck DONT DO IT. If you're not a big fan dont even pay the buck. Get Bat Chain Puller or I'm Gonna Do What I Wanna Do or almost anything else rather than this.
3,Beefheart's last stand,"It is a shame that the person who made this recording, chopped off the songs just before they finish and cut out audience noise. It must have been done to fit it on the album. Even so id rather have a track missing that have it cut up in this way. I was at that very gig at Rotters club in liverpool (an awfull ""Tiffanys"" type, shirt and tie, club) and can assure you that although the songs themselves are technically quite well recorded. The feeling of the gig has been hampered by the cutting of audience reactions to songs.However as Beefheart retired from music after, this his most sucesfull tour. It is pretty much essential for beefheart freaks, in my humble opinion."
2,sent wrong flavor... again,"sent wrong flavor, as they have done in the past. But if they can get it right then its a great product.."
5,Like Real Life,I got this for my 2 toddlers and they love this book. The smells are very strong and they have nice big pictures. The smells really do smell like the real thing. It is a short story so a busy toddler's mind can consontrate long enough. I enjoyed this book.
4,Very Smelly,This is a very nice book. Good pictures and very potent smells. I would have given it 5 stars if 2 of the smells didn't smell VERY much the same. The smell is put on the page not with stickers (like I am used to when I was little some 30 years ago) but with a texured surface that is only visable when you look at it from an angle. Very large areas of smell make it easy to get a good whiff. I am hoping this new way of smell application also lasts much longer than the old way!!? Happy sniffing!
3,"Wonderful illustrations, but not much substance","This book is really book of pictures which cover U-boats on patrol, ship sinkings and rescues, and lots of interior pictures showing U-boat crews going about their duties. There are also some nice pictures of submarine pens in French ports and the captured U-505 here in Chicago at the Museuem of Science and Industry. Each illustration has text which describes what's going on in the picture and includes diary excerpts and letters from actual U-boat crewmen.Although the letters and diary entries do give an idea of what life was like on a U-boat, I was hoping for a deeper discussion of U-boat operations. However, if you're looking for a good source of illustrations and photos of life on a U-boat, this would be a good choice."
5,Concise Restatement of Business Tax,"Having read NOTHING in business taxation prior to the final, I used this book to cram over the course of four days. Amazingly, I received a B, which was well above the median for the course. A nice feature of this book is the casebook table that shows which parts of the outline cover which pages in each of several leading casebooks. This made my unorganized cramming sessions much more manageable. My casebook reading was covered in 89 pages with this outline. Awesome.If it wasn't for this outline, business tax would have killed my GPA and any chances for high honors. More significantly, I actually learned a lot from those four days and have applied the principles learned at my summer job. Good luck!"
5,My favorite children's book,"This is my all time favorite children's book. I am an early childhood educator, and I read tons of books, but this one stands out. The illustrations are brilliant, the concept is moving and beautiful, and it opens the door for talking about fish, frogs, metamorphosis, or even learning not to take things for granted. I love Leo Lionni. The messages in his books can reach into the hearts of people of all ages.Good for Children ages 3-10."
1,Horrible message for children,"This book's message is a horrible one for children. The message is: don't reach for the stars, know you limitations.I'm glad humanity has ignored such messages and has walked on the moon (where we couldn't breath except for our ingenuity).Though the artwork is very colorful and beautiful, it doesn't make up for the poor message."
3,Love the book - not that it's paperback.,"Thoughts:* I loved this book as child, whether one agrees with the material or not, as a child I was memorized by the images!* I knew this book was a paperback but I didn't know it would be so flimsy, so that made me a little sad.* It doesn't have any glitter or shimmer on the fish like my book did when I was kid.* It's a fine book, just not what I was hoping for I guess!A lovely read, at a great price. It's a paperback though, just FYI!"
5,"I bought this book when it first came out, almost forty years ago.","I rebought this book for my son's 42nd birthday! He was thrilled again, as I read it to him time after time after time. It is a classic book and will never go out of style! I still use one the chief phrases in this book, ""Fish are fish and frogs are frogs, and that's that""."
5,SIngle,I found Single very interesting because it connects all the dots about being single in a humorous and non-judgemental way. I am married but my children are not and it showed me just how much the dating game has changed since I was dating. The film is relevant to everyone whether in a relationship or not. It is thought-provoking and generates a lot of conversation.
2,Looked great at first....,"but once they were broken in, they looked terrible. The material that these shoes are constructed from is very thin and tends to wrinkle very badly which makes the shoes look very old right away. I would not have purchased them had I known what they were going to look like just a few weeks later. They do not hold their shape well at all."
3,what you see is what you get,"what you see on the cover is exactly whats inside, not more. very easy. good instructions.I did not like the projects much, but it is a matter of opinion."
4,great ideas for gifts or charity donations,I want to make almost everything in this book. I did not know a hat could be made so simply. I love the idea of giving to people outside of my immediate circle of friends and family. This book has inspired me to make things for people I do not know.
1,"It sucks, but not in a good way.","I got one of these after reading favourable reviews but it drove me nuts. You have to keep it charged up and even then, it barely sucks. Most of the time, I found myself pushing round a little heap of dust with the bristles as the darn thing just wouldn't suck it up, even on a full charge.We moved apartments recently and I had no qualms about leaving it behind in the basement. I am now looking at the Hoover Platinum Stick Vac."
2,Not that great,"I agree with the reviewer who was going to return theirs. I was taken in by the ad campaign last year and the cool colors. But this vacuum doesn't work very well as either a vacuum or a broom. I have since purchased a Shark electric sweeper, and it's fantastic.Also, since I stopped using my Broom Vac, the battery has died and can't be recharged. So now it's worthless without a new battery."
2,Do not do either well,"Its sort of a vacuum and it's sort of a broom, but it does not do either well. The instructions tell you to use it as a broom to sweep the dirt together in a pile and then use the vacuum feature to pick it all up. But the broom is awkward to use, the bristles are too short to sweep normally, and it's too big and bulky for large sweeping motions. I would rate the vacuum power medium. It picks up light dust, but does not do well with large particles or hair. I gave up on the sweeping and just used it as a vac, but since its not made to be used this way, the battery dies very quickly. I'm off to return it and will try something else."
5,Very soft nipple great for my breastfed baby,"This is the only nipple my son likes on the bottles he gets while I am at work. He is breastfed all the rest of the time. If you are breast feeding, only offer stage one nipples so baby gets a slower flow like mom's nipple. Exclusively breastfed babies dont increase volume of milk at the rate of a formula fed baby because breast milk changes composition as baby's dietary needs change so this will be the only nipple size you need.I would not stock up on any brand of bottle/nipple before your baby is born. Wait to see which your (breast milk OR formula fed) baby likes first."
2,Use the Dr. Brown nipples on the born free bottles instead,"Born Free Stage 1 Nipples- Twin PackWe had a baby in 12/07 and bought all new Dr. Brown bottles for him. Then we heard about BPA and switched to Born Free to get BPA free bottles. However, the Born Free nipples collapse with vigorous sucking and frustrate the baby. We found this with the 12 nipples we bought so it couldn't have been just one bad batch. My husband bought new Dr. Brown nipples and tried them on the Born Free bottles. They fit! He saved the day! We tossed the Born free nipples and now use our Born Free bottles with Dr. Brown nipples of the corresponding size. Works great."
3,Product is awesome!!,"I ordered this product because I have used it for my first son. I rate it 3 stars because shipping took way too long, more than 2 weeks. On top of that they sent me level 2 package and when I opened it was level 3 nipples. Was not worth replacing, but I did it anyway. Amazon usually ships faster, and when I tried cancelling the order it said I would have to pay extra shipping because it made my free shipping order under 25 dollars. Seriously!!!! I was better off catching the sale at Baby R US, Buy one get one 50% percent off and avoid the wait and wrong item."
5,Good system,The whole Born Free bottle system is easy to work with and seems to be a good product overall. Used with 2 children.
5,I love it,"Very perfect, I very like ,This is a very good experience . The next time will continue to be in this shopping ."
4,Elvenking - The Winter Wake,"""The Winter Wake"" (2006) is the third album from Italian folk/power metal band Elvenking. Elvenking, as usual, does a good job with the folk elements, including flutes, strings and acoustic guitars, and it makes the music interesting. There's a good variety of songs.Elvenking's one weakness is their lead singer, who does fine on the occasions he goes for death-style vocals, but otherwise has a raspy, pretty un-melodic voice that one might expect on a punk or alternative rock album.Overall this is a very solid power metal album with a strong folk element."
1,"Once again, Terrible!","As someone lightly versed in harder-edged music, I can say without hyperbole that Winter's Wake by Elvenking is possibly the wrist-limpest attempt at 'extreme' metal this reviewer has ever heard. From the frankly dull vocals to the tepid instrumentation, this album will both bore and embarass anyone with a measure of taste. On the upside, this geekish fairy-legend influenced 'music' will at least serve as preemptive birth control. Addendum: Hardcore RPG Fantasy (e.g. Everquest, Kingdom Hearts and Neverwinter Nights) fans will love this."
1,Bad Card/No Drivers for Vista,"I needed a gigabit card for my wife's low profile computer. The SIIG card is a Realtek 8169 and it was not recognized by the Dell Vostro 200 slimline computer after it was installed. The drivers that came with the card were for Win 98, Me, 2k, XP, Server 2003. There are some VISTA drivers for some Realtek cards on the internet, but those drivers did not work and the card had to be returned."
3,#2 Snowy White,"One of the three CDs I purchased. Has some good cuts on it, but arrangements not of as high a quality as the first White Flames CD, and slightly better than #3, Little Wing. Snowy's understated style is there, continues with a couple of cuts reminescent of the Pink Floyd arrangements. Probably would not buy again if had the chance to do it over."
4,Nice follow up to Fire!,"What you have here is the follow up to the club hit ""Fire"". Dolce gives up yet another fierce diva anthem, with thumpin production from the Orange Factory. I had the pleasure of seeing her perform live. She is definately some competiton for Deborah Cox, Pepper Mashay and any other club diva out there. The song is along the lines of Wildlife ""I Don't Want You"", Dynamix ""Don't Want Another Man"" or Kim English ""Everyday""....great maxi-single worth checking out!"
5,a gem.,"I won't go on about this - other fans know their 12-inchers contained awesome power that unfortunately never made it to their studio releases. But that was part of the fun back then - searching out the special stuff. The cannons on ""where the rose is sown"" are worth the price of admission."
2,Does not fit PC,Specifications stated that the board would work in my PC to connect my HP4000 but it did not. Returned for refund. Used a USB to parallel cable adapter instead. It was also less expensive than the board.
5,Obesssion is a favorite,The product was exactly what I was looking for and came in a nice gift box. It was a pleasant gift at Christmas time.
2,Good but could be better...,The book is better condition that what it was decribed. What could improve was the shipping method that the seller implores. I had to wait more than a month to get my book. WHat was good was that once i contacted them they sent it back fast.
5,Great buy,"I first saw the 'come with me kitty harness' on a animal behavorial site as being recommended, I tried to buy in the UK where I live but it wasn't available so I was delighted to find that I could buy through Amazon USA. The product arrived after about 14 days and it is soft and flexible for my cat to wear. The flexible lead makes this harness most unique and comfortable for my darling baby - I would recommend this product although the color options are a bit wild!!!"
3,Different in a Good Way!,This album is very different. The singer has her own creative style and that's something that her fans should appreciate!
4,Just what I needed,Just what I needed to fill in the questions I had about my pending trip to Malta.
4,"Guidebook with good pictures, maps and sugestions. But not a fact book","Typical LP book, more or less what I need and packed with facts. But on the hotel pages, I am surprised to see so few hotels get listed, considering a destination like Malta must offer much much more options at all ranges.What I also would like to see is information about sea links to Sicilly and Tunisia, a day-trip or an organized tour. There is hardly any mentioning of such. You've made all the way to malta, and Sicilly is just an hour and a half away, it is definitely worth of considering visiting.All in all, a typical LP book with almost all information you will need."
4,Good guide book,"This guidebook served us well during our week in Malta. It covers all major attractions and all you need on this small island. My only wish is that there was more information about bus transit. Cab fair is very expensive in Malta and learning how and where to get buses, what times they run is very important."
5,The BEST book on chronic pain I've found.,"I've lived with chronic pain for 2 1/2 years as a result of a car accident which left me with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy. This book addresses issues that apply to all kinds of chronic pain. It is practical and easy to understand. I've bought many, many books on chronic pain, and this is by far the best. I believe this approach to living with chronic pain is realistic, positive and allows the sufferer to make the most of his/her life. The book relates very well to the psychological effects of living with chronic pain. This physical and psychological program allows the sufferer to take back control over his pain and his life. If you or a loved one suffer from chronic pain, this book is a must."
5,Good read for those w/ chronic pain,"I've had to live with severe chronic pain following a lumbar spine fusion 2 years ago that put me in worse pain than before the surgery. Since the surgeon has been worthless in helping me, i've been on my own and when i found this book i was delighted because it described me to a tee. While i haven't found nirvana and will never be pain free, this book has given me a strong set of tools to help deal with the severe pain i live with 24/7. Highly recommended for anyone in a similar boat."
3,Not what I imagined.,"I think that this light is mediocre. It's something (by the looks of it) I would have paid $10 or less for in a store - if that. But, the picture made it look more impressive than it is. With shipping it came to $17.90. I bought this as part of a mother's day present, and I am disappointed with the presentation to say the least.I would not buy this again, and if the return shipping wouldn't be $5, I would send it back."
3,Musician in Tokyo,"Great light -- very sleek and effective. But very small -- much less impressive than I had imagined. And does not spread light across the complete stand, mostly just in one section. Vendor was great and so was the shipping. But this is more of a book light than a music stand light."
1,all Mighty Brights are not the same,"Bought several Mighty Brights in various colors for Christmas presents. All except this one--XtraFlex Silver--were fine. Compared to other this was not ""Super."" This one had only one bulb, had no outlet for AC/DC, and was less sturdy than the others. I wouldn't call it junk, but it will make me very wary before I buy another Mighty Bright light through Amazon!"
4,Pentangle Review,"Excellent early album, with a refreshingly modern sound, even though 40 yrs old. Well worth investigating as the group have recently been putting in a appearance. Seminal album of its era"
1,It's not the worst movie,"There are definitely worst movies than this,but it's an ok movie, Omarion can't act but keeps get movie roles i don't get it & his rapping was horrible,the best thing about the movie was seeing Zulay Henao"
1,Stupidest waste of money ever published,"This books should be called ""I want an alternate income to support my family, so I wrote a book!"". The recipes are too simplistic, not to mention questionably balanced. The author appears to rely heavily on convenience foods rather than real meals and the shopping list prices for this consumer are questionable. I don't know where she's shopping at, but at those prices, the store won't be open long!Horrible book -- don't waste your money."
1,Good Basic information - but very overpriced!,Listings of what items to have available in your pantry for cooking from scratch and recipes of some of their favorite dishes. However the reason they are able to contain their cost of groceries is the simple fact that they do not eat out or eat red meat! Wait to find it at a yard sale.
4,Great book if you're searching for a place to start....,"I have had this book for a long time, and while it is no longer useful to me (I've learned a lot since then) I think it would be good for someone just starting to learn to save money, cook healthy, etc. I have learned to be frugal, shop wisely and cook almost everything from scratch. BUT -- for 12 years I was a single working mother with absolutey no idea how simple it was to shop, cook and eat this way. I would have loved for someone to give me an alternative to fast food and convenience foods way back then. Not everyone knows all of the 'simple' recipes or even how to cook - especially when you are overloaded with work, kids, etc. If you don't know better, cooking from scratch can seem overwhelming and time consuming. I think this is a great book, simply written, with the intention of sharing what they've learned."
1,"Hard Boiled Eggs and Grilled Cheese, please!!!",Who in the world doesn't already know how to make these?? I must say this was the worst book on this subject. Miserly Moms or any Tightwad Gazette are a much better buy. I bought this because someone told me it was great--let's just say I returned it.
2,Wife and mother of three Disappointed,"This is only a recipe book. I have been a parent for ten years and know most of these tips by heart, and could add to the repertoire! Families interested in saving money more than likely already eat these foods, shop at discount grocers and cook with inexpensive ingredients. For those interested in a book on saving money in the kitchen, this is not the book."
2,A bit limited,"This is a CD-ROM and yet the only thing that would make different from a tape is that the final interviews are in video format, which are very bad produced. The method is very simple, a bunch of dialogues that you have to listen and repeat several times, in order to get how french people speak, with almost no lessons on vocabulary. And no lessons on Grammar. Since that is all there is to the method, I find it quite repetetive.There are no excersizes, no tests, nothing other than listen and repeat.This CD-ROM might be useful if you have already learnt French formally a while ago, and you want to freshen up your skills. But if you don't know the language pretty well, this will be pretty hard."
1,Awfully misleading.,"Not bad if you're just working on accent, but there is no attempt at grammar or even the meaning of what you are saying. It provides you with (awfully low quality) videos of people being interviewed in French. Then it plays it back slowly for you. You also see the text in French and English. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure it would be a valuable tool for honing accent and speaking French, but that's all it seems good for. I ended up purchasing Rosetta Stone and once I'm through with that, this may come in handy."
1,A tacky rip off,"""SmartFrench' Audio CDs (Intermediate/AdvancedHalf the program was in Beginner French, ""Intermediate French"" took up eight pages, ""Advanced French"" took up all of nine pages. No Vocabulary, no grammar. It was a $23 joke. No addresses to contact so the money went down the drain.HOW YOU GOT A GROUP OF 4 STAR REVIEWS AND NONE LESS LAUDATORY SUGGESTS THET THE AUTHORS HAD A BUNCH OF RELATIVES!"
1,Skip this idea...splurge on Rosetta,"This product was horrible.Says Mac compatible but is not.I work for a software company, I'm not computer illiterate. Not I or any colleagues could get it working.Sent it back, still waiting on a response/refund from Amazon."
4,Pretty Good!!!,"It had been a long time since I watched this, so I decided to refresh my memory. It was better than what I remembered. Daniel Stern stars as George Piper who wants to take his family on a vacation to revisit where his Great Grandfather fought in the Civil War. Hilarious hijinx happen along the way. I would recommend TOURIST TRAP!!!"
5,An excellent collection of classics!,"Some of the finest female performances in the history of country music are included in this collection! As the title implies, the CD features country-rock legend Juice Newton's classic #1 country/pop hit ""The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known),"" as well as other crossover hits: Linda Ronstadt's ""When Will I Be Loved,"" Crystal Gayle's ""Don't It make My Brown Eyes Blue"" and Bobbie Gentry's ""Ode To Billy Joe."" Other standout tracks are Dottie West's terrific ""Lesson In Leavin,"" Barbara Mandrell's ""I Wish That I Could Fall In Love Today"" and Jessi Colter's tender ballad ""I'm Not Lisa."" Also included are tracks by Suzy Boguss, Billie Jo Spears, Jean Shepard, Rose Maddax, Jody Miller and legends Tanya Tucker and Wanda Jackson. Overall, a wonderful collection with many essential recordings!! Recommended!!"
4,Disappointing finish,Seems hard to believe after the long ongoing story between the two that the last story would end without a finish. It really leaves you empty.
5,Entire collection.,I was pleased to give my friend the gift of the last episodes of the Inspector Lynley Mystery Series. Glad they were available to buy.
5,Inspector Lynley Mysteries-Series 6,"This 6th in the Inspector Linley Mystery series is excellent mysteries in its presentation, plot, dialogue and under-current issues. The portrayed relationship between the two main characters keeps a certain personal tension, as well as a tension with the Scotland Yard politics. The plot indicates the intricancies of the attempts to solve a crime to charge the correct perpetrator--who has woven a web of covertness. Highly recommended whether the first or as part of the continuing series from the beginning."
3,"Enjoyable, but not as great as the rest!!","This series is one of my favorite British shows, but this last DVD doesn't live up to the previous episodes. It is enjoyable and entertaining. The first episode, Limbo is the better of the two. The latter episode is a letdown, for me anyway: in viewing this one, I understand why the series wasn't renewed for more episodes. Instead of working together, Havers and Lynley work more against each other in this one. For the price, you only get two episodes here, instead of the usual four, so the purchase is up to you."
4,Itsy bitsy hangers,"Ordered w/o paying much attention to the size dimensions so it's intended use as a coat/sweater rack was squashed as soon as I opened the box. However, for the past 2 years or so it's make a wonderful potholder rack. Great for the kitchen, just not your coats!"
5,Rock,"This album is so great, you can't help but like all the songs. Waltham's such a nice change from the bands nowadays that all sound like they've been cloned from each other. Never a dull moment on this album, straight up rock n' roll. They're even better live too!"
4,For those who like their romances leavened with humor,"Based on the reviews here, I obtained a copy of this book and found all the positive comments to be true. While many books dealing with this period utilize a hero wounded at Waterloo, Ms. Chase has done an excellent job of showing problems that are not stereotyped and making her hero real. I liked the analysis with respect to his dandyism, too - very original. But my favorite aspect of the book was the humor and witticisms. Excellent read."
3,Mostly good -- 3.5 stars,"Alistair is a good hero; his penchant for falling in love quickly was a nice touch. His wounded leg and amnesia worked to make him slightly tortured, just enough to add complexity -- again, a nice variation. My problem with the book was Mirabel; I did not always like her. I thought her obstinancy about retaining the nature of the land around her was never given a sufficiently compelling reason. Worse, the methods she employed against Alistair were sometimes cruel and underhanded. Also the comments about his being a babe when she's done such-and-such...jeez, he's only 2 years younger. Perhaps they were said as a joke, but it wasn't clear and wasn't funny as written. At other times, however, she was quite likeable; it was this mixed feeling about her along with never feeling the same depth of feeling from her that one did from him that shortchanged the romance.Nevertheless, the book had a lot of good points. It's worth reading, but not the best."
4,"Not the best of Chase's books, but still enjoyable","Considering Loretta Chase's standard, this book was disappointing. I enjoyed it, but not as much as The Last Hellion, Lord of Scoundrels, The Sandalwood Princess and every other past book or story. I have read all of her other books multiple times and still laugh out loud (and get teary-eyed). I don't think that will occur with Miss Wonderful.I will still buy any book or story Ms. Chase publishes and I'm already looking forward to Mr. Impossible, due in 2005."
3,"Botany, nightmares, and love at last",A great introduction to a new series but lacking the spark and sense of adventure that mark Chase novels. While always intelligently written and well done the two main characters just didn't grab me like the pair in Mr. Impossible.
4,Mr wonderful,"I love it when the hero love the heroine so much he can't see straight, and this was definitely that kind of story. I'll be reading more of chases books!"
2,Miss Wonderful - Isn't!,"Where has Loretta Chase gone to? She took several years off after LOS and The Last Hellion, to write this book. Why?Try as I might, I can't see a 31 year old spinster- during the Regency Period -to be a heroine. And the hero? A fribbish fop!No, go back, Loretta, do what you do best- humor, real people - complicated plots - elegant language - did I mention real people?. Give me another LOS or another Vere. TRY!"
3,Original but the hero too girly,"Loretta Chase writes well and I liked the originality of the story. I don't think I've ever read an historical where the hero is a bit of a fop and falls in love easily. And, the plot of someone trying to secure land for a railroad is certainly original. The hero and heroine being on either side of this proposed deal is a good way of keeping them apart. I gave the novel three stars based on all of this. However, the hero had no appeal for me. He acted rather juvenile and too ""girly."" The heroine was much stronger, more aggressive and more competent than he. I don't like stories in which the heroine has more testosterone than the hero. And, similarly, I'm not a fan of stories in which the woman has to chase the man, run him to ground and almost force him to have sex with her. All in all, IMHO, the story line was neither romantic nor ""hot."""
3,Miss Wonderful by Loretta Chase,"I read this novel because it was rated as one of the top 100 romances. It was a disappointment. On the cover is quote by Stephanie Laurens, ""Wickedly witty, simply wonderful."" If you truly want a book that lives up to this obvious hype, read Judith Ivory's ""The Proposition."" Miss W isn't nearly as witty, as wicked nor as wonderful as the Ivory novel."
5,Excuuuse me princess!,This is my favorite of all the shows in this series. Though the jokes are not the best they still make me laugh. And the personalities aren't quite the way I imagined it's still very cool. You get to see everything that you had to imagine before come to life! I am one of the biggest Zelda fans I know and none of my friends like this because they don't like the Zelda games. But since I am a true Zelda fan this is one of my favorite shows! If you like the Zelda games even a little you should definetly buy this.
5,Fred does it once again...5 stars!!!,"Fred is an icon of the surfing community. His written works are truly memorable and facinating to read. While I know all the breaks he's written about in the surfing portions of his book, I was also in awe about his other exploits in the mountains, etc. My wife was equally enthralled with the book (she, like Fred, is a teacher.) His love of life is genuine and this book is an uplifting piece that everyone should read, whether you surf or not."
4,Parodies plus great musicianship,"Bob Kanefsky is a brilliant lyricist, but doesn't perform. Luckily, he has friends who do, and do it well. Singing, instrumentation, and production are all first rate. My favorite moment is Annwn tearing into a parody of their own song, Red Queen, joyfully singing the line, ""And the worms crawl in, and the worms crawl out..."""
5,All For Nothing,"This book is a great resource for information about the last ""great train robbery"" in the U.S. Larry Sturholm and John Howard collaborated with the last remaining perpetrator of this crime to dispel many of the conflicting stories that have been printed over the years. Sturholm was a newspaper reporter, so the level of writing in this book is pretty simple. An easy read for anyone interested in this crime and the effort to bring the perpetrators to justice."
1,Waste of $$,"I've had these storage bags for over a year. Storage bags don't stay vacuum sealed, the vacuum sucked the seal right off one of the bags rendering it useless. Every other week or so have to drag the vacuum into the closet where these bags are stored and vacuum out the air again and again and again (you get the idea). Usually try to give products the benefit of the doubt but this product doesn't deserve it."
2,Mr. Cave's Sinking Ship,"I have to say that ""Rock of Gibraltar"" and ""She Passed by My Window"" are definitely two of the worst songs Mr.Cave has ever written. No wonder Blixa left. The only song that keeps this album from drowning is ""Right Out of Your Hand"", a sublime country-ballad that's way up there with ""The Ship Song"", ""Slowly Goes the Night"", and ""Love Letter"". Thank God Mr. Cave's muse came back after this disappointment."
5,"I'm sorry but, I loved it.","Given, I'm only a fairly recent (last 2-3 years) Nick Cave fan, and only own 8 of his albums (including Abbatior Blues/Lyre Live and B-Sides), but I loved this album. I was expecting, from the mild and somewhat disapointed reviews of fellow fans, a much lamer album. If your looking for another ""First Born Is Dead"" (one of my favorites), then you may be disapointed, but as for a smooth transition from the intensely moody No More Shall We Part to the more objective and interested Abbatior/Lyre albums, this is a winner. It has a few of his best songs on it, like Wonderful Life and Bring It On, and the insane, only-Nick-Cave-could-have-written Babe, I'm On Fire, and is just another great collection of the amazing unique brilliance that is Nick Cave. But then again, to be perfectly fair, maybe I'm TOO biased. I almost think that he can't make anything bad, if he tried.I love everything I've ever heard of his, this album included. Enjoy!"
3,Mediocre Nick,"NIck Cave has a habit of putting out a great album followed by a good but decidedly less powerful album. And he's done it again. No More Shall We Part is one of Cave's best albums. There are at least three or four songs that are classics! I'd have to say that this album has none. Not that they're bad! It's a good album. Just not up to par. In fact most of this album sounds like B-sides from the No More Shall We Part sessions. However, Nick is my very favorite musical artist and I will still buy anything he puts out, because chances are it will staisfy me more than 99% of the albums released that year."
2,Generally Unsatisfying Offering,"Lyrically and musically, this album was a disappointment for me, and throughout felt like Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds at their worst. The signature poetry of Cave has been flourishing in recent efforts toward more mature and consciously intense musical effect of ""The Boat Man's Call"" and ""No More Shall We Part"". ""Nocturama"" is a bit of an anti-climax in Nick Cave's late career."
3,Not his Best but I dig It,"This good but last one better. Get last one before. Get Good Son before you get either. Or Murder Ballads, or Let Love In... I need to listen to this one more."
2,"Babe, the song is too long!","""Babe I'm On Fire"" goes on and on for fifteen minutes. Good Lord, how many times does he repeat the chorus? He could've and should've smashed it out in three minutes letting all the avant garde elements roar the whole time. It really ruins the record. I have nothing against a long song but a long song that stays in one place like that is just torture. It brings to mind 'Cream Live'. Babe, the fire went out twelve minutes ago."
3,Copy-protection?!,"The good news is that with the japanese import you get 3 extra songs.The bad news is that after spending $...you find out that the disc is COPY-PROTECTED! Not only can you not even make a copy for yourself, but your computer won't even play the thing.Buyer Beware..."
3,"Babe, I'm Kind of Bored","I was greatly anticipating this CD for the longest time. Being a huge fan and practically obsessing over No More Shall We Part for the past 2 years, I feel a bit let down. That album was a brilliant masterpiece that won't most likely be topped. I just don't see the same level of passion in Nick's voice or his lyrics this time around. Nothing right off the cuff seems to be wrong here, it just seems to be missing that special ingredient. Perhaps with further listens, I will be happily proved wrong, as , I really want to love this CD."
4,Progression and return=great stuff,"This is totally solid, with enough upbeat material to augment the ballad style work at which Nick has excelled in recent years. There's also a hint of the unbridled mania that informed his earliest work with the Birthday Party (obviously on ""Babe, I'm On Fire"" and ""Dead Man in My Bed""). To me, this progression and slight return is welcome and works extraordinarily well with the more contemplative compositions.I can't get enough of either, so I say bring it on! More.Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds forever."
4,A more mainstream rocker,"This one is 10 times more commercial than No more shall we part but it still sounds good. Nick used to be a weird rock star and now he is moving into the proper rock star phase. From the sound of this one he seems to want to impress my dad with his normality, but I think the album is still good."
2,Underdeveloped,"This is Nick at his most disappointing. Lyrically and musically the album is underdeveloped--most strikingly in the tiresome, often childish lyrics (e.g. Rock of Gibraltar). The love ballads are starkly unconvincing, the rocking tracks are dull and repetitious. There is very little enjoyment to be taken from this listen, particularly in comparison with Cave's last studio release, the exquisitely crafted No More Shall We Part."
5,THE DOYENNE DOES IT AGAIN!,"I picked up Lifshin's book at a bookstore in Portsmouth, NH., didn't put it down for awhile. Where else can you get a book that deals with love, life and death so beautifully. Her work inspires me to do better as a writer and a poet."
4,Terrific Read,As a masters student in psychology this book was required reading. It is a terrific account of a first hand case study involving a couple. You get to read both sides and the therapist view point. Very enlightning and helps the beginner to see what the master sees. Also good for anyone looking for more insight into their own relationship.
2,After the fight,"I had read this book and used it for a research reference in my graduate work. Although Wile expresses interesting ways to go about marital therapy, the overall quality of the book was almost like fighting with the couple. The book seemed more like a novel with dramatic overtones. If you are interested in learning more about what a person is actually thinking, listen to yourself."
3,O.K,"Not what you'd expect but its pretty good. My question is: Who the heck are the countdown kids? Some of them arent very good singers. Like in the beggining of ""Silent Night"" the girl sounds horrible. I and everyone else probably would expect songs like ""Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer"", or ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town."" But actually there is Cristian songs (at least Im a Cristian)like ""Silent Night"",""We Three Kings"", or ""Away In A Manger.""This CD is o.k."
2,S L O W music,"This is not a ""children's"" cd in my opinion. It is children singing in a very formal style and quite a slow tempo. It did not really keep my kids' attention for very long."
4,Quirky British eccentric,"If you like the idea of a jump blues piano playing British songwriter who also messes with cheap synthesisers, Jona Lewie's worth checking out. If you like Ian Dury and John Otway you'll dig Jona Lewie too, most likely."
1,Boring!!!!,I read up to page 45 and couldn't finish reading the rest so I read the last 10 pages and it was still boring!!!!. This is the first time in my life that I've read the last few pages of a book without completely reading the whole book! I would have prefered to give half a star for effort.
1,An Irritating Read,"I bought this book at the used book sale at the library for $.25. I paid too much. The author's views are simplistic, his style verbose. It's scary to imagine that this man is in private practice."
5,Flash DVD?,I love the movie Flash! What an entertaining movie for the whole family. But when are they coming out with a Flash DVD? I have vhs tape but cannot watch it.
3,"""Sorrel Horse Girl's"" review","This movie is PRETTY good. The boy who plays the rider is a good actor, and the horse is brilliant. It is a fun adventure, and funny at times. I think the family tragedies start to get a little off-beat and cheesy, though. First he's happy. Then his dad leaves. Then his horse is abused. Then Grandma kills herself at a sewing mill. Then he sells the horse for a coffin for Grandma. These are a few slightly morbid points that I will caution you about. Also, though it is fantasy, it isn't well-worked. It doesn't make you believe it's almost real, like movies such as THE BLACK STALLION or HOMEWARD BOUND. Overall, a ""just-once"" flik that horse lovers will love. PS, Angry Reviewer: Two year old horses are perfectly capable of things at 2."
5,Needs to be on DVD,"This movie is awsome but really needs to be on DVD. My Grandson just loves horses and this tops it all, he really likes the way the boy acts and plays a very good part, Oh and the horse too."
4,Great kids movie,"I rented this awhile back, mainly because I have a soft spot for children's movies. Unfortunatly I viewed it through adult eyes and that's why I couldn't give it 5 stars, I'm sure some years back I would have though. It's a real sweet story with the classic Disney trademark on it, I'd say any horse crazy kid will love it. One little side note to the person who went off about this movie...yes kids may clamor for a horse, but most parents are smart enough to realize a horse costs way more than a dog. Also, by the age of two many thoroughbred horses are not only trained, but running strenuous races."
4,Wonderful acting by Lucas Black,"This movie is a classic Disney-formula movie, which means it's a great family movie. However, I have no children and loved it. Lucas Black is a fantastic young actor. Be sure to have a box of tissues close by."
5,Classic CHRISTY,"June at her best,in fine voice and her renditions of all songs are simpley the most!"
3,Style overpowers substance,"Pyne has won a deserved reputation as the leading cultural historian and philosopher of fire. This book should have been an opportunity to summarize his findings in a clearly written, easily read way for people who are unlikely to read his more detailed studies. Pyne does offer us many interesting observations and perspectives on the history of fire. Unfortunately, he imposes a pretentious ""writerly"" style on his material, making his book laborious to read. His self-conscious literary artistry obscures as much as it reveals. Many of his poetic statements are not explained with supporting facts. A more straightforward telling of this story would be welcome."
1,Unreadable,"This book might contain some interesting information, but if it does it's hidden beneath an impenetrable layer of literary and poetic pretension. Every second sentence contains a simile or metaphor.... seriously! It gave me a headache trying to read it.To communicate effectively, writing should be clear and direct. This book is anything but. Perhaps the author should read someone like Jarred Diamond to see how to bring an interesting topic to life.It's a shame, because the list of chapters looks interesting. Perhaps someone else will write / has written a book covering similar territory."
3,OK But Disappointing,"I purchased this CD after falling in love with Leah's ""Songs of the Circle"" CD. Perhaps my disappointment with ""Great Turning"" is that I expected the music to be more chant-like in nature (as ""Songs of the Circle"" is). Personally, I think chant is Lisa's strength, so ""Great Turning"" fell short for me. Chant's appeal for me as a musician is its repetitive nature and simple melody lines--easy to learn and sing on one's own to pray and be in the moment throughout ones day. Can't really do that with the ""folk"" element of the songs on this CD. They feel a bit ""contrived"" and commercial. Again, perhaps my expectations are what brought disappointment (which is often the case, eh?)."
1,disappointment,"I have purchased the book trusting that it is part of brasilian jujitsu series. Compared to other books of the series, photos are not clear at all, explanations are not good, and I am in martial arts over 20 years, I could not see what is for experts. If you want an advanced book get J.J.Machado's one. The jello guard is probably invented just for having invented something. The jujitsu techniques are not advanced at all and the division of the book as jujitsu, submission wrestling, and vale tudo, leaves very little space for the techniques of each group, reducing the book to a mediocre technical level, with few techniques.Do not forget that Sperry, Bustamante, and others are not with him any more. I regret having purchased it."
5,One of the greatest MMA fighters/coaches ever.,"Carlson Gracie was one of the 5 champions of the Gracie family. He also was the coach of some of the biggest names in MMA. This book has sections on sport BJJ, Vale Tudo/MMA and can help any grappling student. The people complaining that some of it is too basic are most likely people who don't train and would rather learn playing XBox."
5,how to get what you want and want what you have,This is an excellent video. John Gray tells it like it is. If you are ready to hear what Gray has to say then you are ready for this video. He provides you with tools that will allow you to review and examine your life and motivations. This video is empowering and has something for everyone. His review of relationships is very honest. You will come away understanding why it is important to understand and love yourself before you can truly love and understand other people in your life.
3,Disappointed,"I was very excited to get this VHS especially after viewing the Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus video...plus I read the review prior to purchase and it seemed like a great buy. I was wrong. Dr. Gray talks about loving yourself yes, but truly doesn't say much about what needs to be done about it. Most of it was common sense...something that eventually one can figure out on ones own. I was completely nonplussed and bored. I turned it off during the second part because I was just simply tired of hearing the same thing over and over again. Even the audience seemed dazed by his rhetoric. I am sure someone will get something out of this but you need to be either severely depressed or have extreme low self esteeem. I was unhappy about this video."
5,Sunny and Brandon are truly Captivating,"Praise to Lori Wick for her outstanding and truly profound way of writing. ""The Hawk and the Jewel"" was the third novel that I read by Lori Wick but it is my absolute favorite--I finished the book in about five hours. It was just that good. This book is a must-read for all ages. You will fall in love with the spirited Sunny and hope that you yourself can find a love like that, which is shared between Sunny and Brandon. This book is full of excitement, mystery and of course romance. You won't want to put it down."
5,13 YEAR OLD READER,"I have read alot of books, and I'm sure you have too. But this book is a great book and I would recommend this book to any one who wants a good clean book. If you have not read the Hawk and the Jewel I would recommend you buy this book today!!"
1,here is the truth,"If you want to read a book that demolishes all sense of literary talent with a hopeless and ridiculous romantic story- this is it. The story could have been so much better, if it was written well."
5,Captivating and Romantic,"Lori Wick is one of my favorite Christian fiction authors. This book captured my attention from the get-go. I did not want to put it down and before I was one-third of the way through, I knew I had to have the other books in Kensington Chronicles Series."
3,Predictable!!!!!,"For a first time reader of Lori Wick, I was amazed to discover that this book was too predictable and didn't capture my full attention. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys predictable stories."
5,The wonderful power of love,"This book is an excellent piece of fiction. Lori Wick's characters were so well developed, I felt I knew them. The wonderful storyline clearly showed God's redeeming grace and the extraordinary power of love. This was a great book to read (many times over in fact)and I recommend it to everyone, man or woman."
5,Always a joy,I've read this book at least a dozen times and I still get excited by the story each time. A true gem!!
5,Kensington Setting is Great,Love the old Englsih timeline. Good romantic story that can be passed on to all my female family members of all ages.
5,Great Condition!!,This book was just like new when I got it! I was surprised actually. It came on time. Thanks so much!
2,Takes a little practice - then great !,I used this on our recent trip to Tahiti and Hawaii .. Takes a little getting used to but then takes great pictures for the price and the fact you are under water !!!
3,SD card maximum,"To M. Charthern: as Mr. Blankenship noted and as listed on the camera's specs, the maximum SD card is only ""up to 2GB"". So, try that - it works on mine and apparently worked on Mr. B's.For the price, it works well enough. It rains in unpredictable patterns in Paris. Using this, I never have to worry about harming my really good cameras."
4,child's first real camera,I bought this for my grandaughter. She loves the water & has enjoyed this camera taking favorite pictures underwater. Very good value for the money. Also durable for an 8 year old to use.
4,"Great for the money, and an excellent snapshot camera","I actually just got this camera today, and have already taken some decent pics with it. I agree with everyone else in that you need to read the instruction manual thoroughly to make sure you are getting the most out of your camera. However, it is capable of taking great snapshots. The only drawback I have found is that it is hard to hold the camera still enough that the pictures won't come out blurry. Sharpness is kind of an issue in general with this camera (it's not unacceptable, but of course it's not going to look like a Nikon). But considering you can get an underwater camera for under $100, I would say this camera is a great deal! I'm planning on taking it on some shallow water scuba dives/snorkeling trips."
3,"Had some problems, but we still got some good Pic's","Bought this for our trip to Cozumel Mexico.. The video mode froze up the whole camera the last few days we used it. So you had to get out of the water, take it out of the case. Remove the batteries to turn it off. Then we just stopped using the video mode.. Pictures were allot better then the 35mm disposable camera we did last time. Needed to be sunny out for the best pictures.. The video's we did get are better then I thought it would be. Our friends really liked the fact you can watch what we did, rather then look at all pictures in the water. We got one video with a small sting ray burring himself under the sand. It was awesome! That was worth buying this camera.The camera itself is cheap and plastic, the water case it nice.. For the price it worked for us."
3,underwater digital,"Good news it did not leak down to 20'(snorkeling at Grand Cayman), but focal length is limited to close shots, if you are scuba diving and have control over your movements then it would probably be ok, but for snorkeling where you are moving most of the time, it does not focus well. Must practice with camera before using I think that would help, which is something I did not do (not likely to jump in the pool in Oklahoma in mid January), also it eats the 'aaa' batteries even when it is turned 'off', so remove them when not in use, otherwise you will be disappointed when you jump in the ocean and your batteries are dead."
3,Good starter or kid's camera,"Bought this for my six year old as an alternative to the Fisher Price Kid-Tough Digital camera. The price is about the same as the FP toy camera, plus the waterproof and shockproof casing makes it a better deal for an active kid; you can take it kayaking, to the pool, to the lake, and the waterpark! My son loves being able to take his own pictures and download them to his iPhoto library! The picture quality is only fair; but it's still better than the FP toy camera. Also, the ISO speed only goes up to 200, so using the built-in flash is necessary for indoor and low-light photography."
3,Great Underwater Alternative,"I purchesed this camera to allow me to get some underwater shots. My usual camera is a prosumer range DSLR so my expectations for a under $100 camera were not high. For the money, this camera should perform well. The alternatives are disposable film cameras and they are not good. My uther alternative is a $600+ underwater shell for my Canon - Too expensive. For the money, this camera should serve you well."
2,Horrible image quality,"If you get it cheap enough, it might be fun as a canoe camera or to try getting some snorkeling pictures, but the image quality is absolutely dreadful. And the delay between pressing the shutter button and the picture being taken is very long."
1,VuPoint 5 Megapixel Underwater Digital Camera is Terrible,"This is a terrible camera. We bought it for use underwater on a snorkeling trip, and the quality, clarity and sharpness of the pictures is awful. I got much better quality, clarity and sharpness of pictures with the cheap,underwater, one-time use cameras sold by Kodak and others."
2,Dissapointed,"I bought this camera because it had several favorable reviews. Unfortunately, it was a major dissapointment. The flash has a mind of its own, the pics quality is mediocre and it's definitely over priced. I guess this camera doesn't have much competition in the market hence its popularity. It's a piece of expensive junk."
1,VuPoint is a Cell Phone Camera in Disguise,"The VuPoint reviews are misleading, The VuPoint Camera is just a cheap cell phone camera disguised as an underwater camera, and it is not even a good camera at all. If you don't believe me just take a good look at the camera lens and you will notice that it looks exactly like you phone camera lens. Actually, any cell phone currently in the market can take better pictures than this VuPoint. I returned it before I had a chance test the waterproof case, but the case looked flimsy and the locking mechanism does not have a secure lock, it may open accidentally underwater. Also this camera wins the price as the electronic device with the most fake reviews I have ever seen on Amazon. You have been warned."
1,Dont bother,"Image quality is HORRIBLE, My cell phone takes better images.Returning it because when I turn the flash on the camera shuts down.Very unhappy"
2,Arrived too late,"Unfortunately the item did not arrive as prommised! Was not able to test it out on our vacation. I ordered the camera and a snorkle set on the same order - both were promised within a week - the snorkle set came as promised, the camera showed up 5 days later after we left for vacation. very dissappointed with seller - tried to communicate with them and although they responded promptly, they would not offer to expidite or help - by then it was too late to try and order from another seller."
2,Deceiving book title,"This book is made for crafters, quilters and other embroiderers and is adequate as far as patterns go. BUT, the title of the book deceivingly presents it as using ribbons and this is not so. The techniques presented are made with strips and scraps of fabric, most of them aligned in geometric patterns. These are absolutely NOT ribbons. This book is useless to me. It would have been OK if titled in a different way, not mentioning ribbons.Also the book photography if dreadful, un-professional, in bad lighting, cropped incorrectly and too small. As if the author had asked a friend with no photography experience to do it.The only good photos are the historic photos from museums and collections included in the interesting chapter about historical Native American quilting. This is the only chapter worth reading.This book is not worth the money and I regret purchasing it."
2,Parts are funny,Parts are funny but based on others reviews I thought it would have me laughing the entire time. Not close to being in top 10 stand-up performances.
5,tremendo,esto me acuerda mucho mi ninez me encato volver a ver a lucero aleks sintec a todos los artistas que estan aqui me gustaria saber donde estan los demas definitivamente si te gustaba chiquilladas compralo
4,prevention,"These are great to prevent swelling while you are pregnant. I started with the lowest pressure, but imagine you can go up if needed."
1,"Before you buy Targus power adapters, read the reviews on other models","I don't own this model, but -- like a lot of other people -- got totally blindsided by Targus on another model when they suddenly stopped making additional tips for new hardware, turning my adapter into an expensive paperweight. Other reviewers have also reported lots of reliability and quality problems with Targus power adapters and total indifference from their service department. Do yourself a favor -- don't be seduced by the promise of changeable power tips. Read the reviews on other Targus power supplies before buying!"
2,"Though a great effort, the book should not be used for breed","Though a great effort, the book should not be used for breed identification. I was very disappointed in the attempts to represent over half of the breeds that the artist was trying to convey. Either the artist was not a horse person, or she could not convey the breeds' charactaristics through this medium. The pictures in themselves were, lovely, full of motion and life, but if one were to try to identify horses through this field guide, they might run into great difficulty."
1,"great theme, poorly developed","The author squanders his ideas, all of the three main themes are important but having introduced them he gives the requisite couple of lines and then scurries on to his implausable, muddled plot. Huxley tackled some of the same themes over sixty years ago and did it better. True we can't all be Huxley, but if we dare to launch ourselves into print its best left to those who have something original to say."
2,"NOT a ""Kit""","The Motocraft FT113 Automatic Transmission Filter Kit is not a kit at all. It only comes with the filter. If you plan to drop the pan and perform a transmission filter change, you will need to also order a gasket separately. For the price, it seems there are alternatives that include the gasket and are actual kits as opposed to just a filter in a box. Very misleading product description."
4,Lynch Mob Live with Robert Mason,"I guess I showed my ignorance a little when purchasing this product, as I completely forgot that the band had more than Oni Logan as a vocalist ...Robert Mason is good, but to me, he's no Oni Logan and they have quite different styles.We picked this up at a really good price, for the CD/DVD set, about $6 plus $3 S&H;, but it disappointed us a little, because it's Robert and not Oni.We saw Oni with the band, earlier this year and he was great.This kind of is lacking some, it's also not a straight concert with interview at the end.The whole thing is frequently interrupted by George Lynch's comments on how this song and that came together.It just kills the flow.Ah well.VFM wise, good value, but not what I was hoping for.Your call folks ...."
3,Not the greatest but still enjoyed it,"Like others have said, the production value of this is pretty poor... looks like amateurs did it. Definitely left a lot to be desired in terms of seeing good shots of George Lynch and the band as a whole. But overall I still enjoyed the concert. While the bonuses were not lengthy, or anything special, I still enjoyed those as well. Since there isn't much out there for these guys, if you are a fan its not a bad buy."
1,beverage coaster,"Something only a Lynch fanatic would need to complete his collection. Dvd is terrible, bad audio mix and not in sync with the footage"
1,George Nu-Metal is over it's ok to tune back to E!!!!!,"Ok everyone WAKE UP! Let korn do their thing with tuning to C, EVERYONE else get back to standard pitch. THIS IS GARBAGE! George is tuned way to low again and it sounds like mud."
2,Dead Air,There are several dead spots in the film where the screen goes black and there is no sound. They last for 20 or more seconds.
4,A much needed Flood model,"One thing that has been lacking in Creationary Catastrophism has been a concise and consistent Flood model which can explain the geologic record as it is found. Woodmorappe's TAB's model was one of the first flood models and it is able to explain some aspects of the geologic record.As Creationary Catastrophism has continued to grow, other flood models have been developed. The TAB's model may or may not be part of future flood modeling, but it remains as the first example of a much needed paradigm. Woodmorappe is to be commended for leading the way for others to follow."
5,Great Resource Book for New Ideas!,"This book is a compilation of scientific articles from various sources written by John Woodmorappe between 1978 and 1993. Many of the articles address problems and challenges that have been put forth against the Young Earth Creationist paradigm. The second edition of the book has been greatly enhanced by the inclusion of an index. All of the articles are well researched and thoroughly referenced. The articles contained within this volume help delineate problems within the Young Earth Creationist paradigm and suggest possible solutions to them. John attacks problems like radioactive dating, cyclic sedimentation, the ""geologic column,"" the Flood, and various evolutionary issues. The articles should stimulate anyone reading them to a deeper level of thought about these issues, no matter what their perspective on earth history may be."
4,Some Serious Creationist Research,"This work is an excellent way to show that evolutionists who claim ""creationists don't do any research"" is an obviously false claim. John Woodmorappe has been a dedicated Creation scientist, with important publications such as ""The Myth of Modern Dating Methods"" and ""Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study"". Although I still believe that the flood model has a long way to go, John contributes an impressive effort in order to help our Biblical understanding of the past improve. The study on the geological column is a very important issue, and Woodmorappe offers an excellent chapter dealing with the ""Essential Nonexistance"" of the geological column.I have two problems with this work, however. One is that there are too many quotations used, and the other is that the material is a bit outdated in some areas. However, the book is a worthwhile addition to Creationist studies."
3,A light read,Good book for a light read...fits well with the lazy low energy weekend afternoon. I would suggest it if you prefer this genre.
3,The Expendable Spy - a tale of World War II,The subtitle of this book sums it up pretty well in that it is certainly 'a tale of World War II'. It's not much else beyond that. The main character is quite boring and doesn't seem to have much substance for a spy. Spies don't need to be a James Bond type but spies usually have something happen to them in life that allowed themselves to give up a normal life to be immersed in espionage and this character does not have that type of background.
3,The Expendable Spy,"This book was entertaining, but not gripping. The ""spy's"" most notable attributes seemed to be his uncanny nack for winding up in the company of women who wanted to have sex, and to recover from injuries that would have been permanent disabilites for normal people-not that there is anything wrong with either."
2,spy tale,"OK, not great. Fine light reading for those of us who can't get enough of the spy genre. I might try others by this author."
4,World War II thriller,"Kurt Auster, is a young Jewish refugee from Vienna in pre-war Europe. He flees Vienna after his parents are murdered, and his ambition is to fight the Nazis and find the man who murdered his parents. He is brave and resourceful and is sent on missions impossible by his British commander, who for some reason not entirely made clear, has deemed him entirely expendable. Unfortunately, this is never fully explained. As a native German speaker, he is able to venture amongst the enemy and he triumphs against impossible odds. This makes for a thrilling read and I had difficulty putting the book down. A good read!"
1,amateurish writing,This book suffers from writing that fails to hold the reader's interest. The plot is far fetched and difficult to believe. It was one of the most difficult kindle books I've ever tried to bore through. I'd look elsewhere for a good read.
1,Amateurish,"I had a hard time with this book. The author is not even in close to Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn.I agree with another reviewer that it seem to be writted at the highschhol level.The paragraphs seem to be written in steps.The sexual content was also strange and at the end I asked myself why he did not kill-off his first encounter at the alp.An avalange would have been convenient.The author must be jewish or have a jewish agenda. This is OK but at one point there were some forged papers made by Switzerland, he observed that the Swiss will do anything for money.As a Swiss national I was of the impression that this is more known as a jewish trait."
3,It's okay,"Have had time only to skim through it right now. It appears to be rather a lightweight history of American Methodism, but may have some insights not published elsewhere."
3,Good but not Live,"The CD is good, but not nearly as good as I was wishing for. It just didn't have the same style as the live performance I bought it at did. While it is still really cool, you have to see this group perform live. They are absolutely fantastic and like nothing I've ever heard before."
4,Agro Guy Stories,"This is a pretty darn solid collection. A couple of these stories are truly great. It is, indeed very much like Thom Jones, which is a mixed blessing. I think this guy has better work ahead of him. One can not help but think, get Archie Moore to train you, you still ain't knockin nobody out, Cambridge. Worth picking up."
3,OUT-OF-DATE BOOK,"The Oxford Classical Dictionary was newly edited. Of course I admit that second edition of the dictionary had good points e.g. explanations on literary works , and third edition of it contains some mistakes e.g. chapter numbers of classical sources. However the new=3rd edition is improved much better than 2nd one ,e.g. adding new entries like Homosexuality,Secular prostitution, Abortion, Menstruation, Gynaecology, etc. If you can read German language , I recommend A. Pauly, G. Wissowa, and W.Kroll's ""REAL-ENCYCLOPAEDIE D. KLASSISCHEN ALTERTUMSWISSENSCHAFT"". However if you like antiquated books, it is a good idea to buy 2nd edition of Oxford Classical Dictionary, also Lempriere's Classical Dictionary and William Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, Biography & Mythology."
3,its okayy,"THE BIGGEST NEGATIVE:if you are a picture or ring tone junky like i am, this is NOT the phone for you. the memory for backgrounds, ringtones, pictures, and videos is all in one section. if i have 3 ringtones, i can only have around 15 pictures saved with high quality. needless to say, THIS IS ANNOYING.Because of this, I will probably switch back to my old Samsung E 315.This phone does have a good battery life, and speakerphone."
1,I hate this item and tmobile,"I got this phone recently; it's not as cool as motorola RAZR, it is not fancy, it does not have many ringtones(only 6-7 available). T-mobile made me pay $50 bucks for this phone in order to continue my plan, but if you buy it directly from Amazon, they give you the phone for free and additional $75.Cheaters! tmobile"
3,"Nice phone, not so durable","I really liked this phone for about 9 months. It had great reception and battery life (really all I care about in a phone) and survived a few drops. However, one day the main LCD developed a crack (manifesting itself as a big black spot, making text messaging and accessing the phonebook impossible) for no apparent reason. I don't know if it is just my bad luck or if the problem is chronic with this phone. You have been advised!"
2,Very disappointing phone,"This is my least favorite phone I've ever owned. The ring tones it comes with are a joke. Every one is dreadful. And the phone's user interface is completely non-intuitive, and I've used a lot of cell phones. I usually keep a cell phone for at least two years, but this one is going to have to go."
5,Cuentos para después de hacer el amor,"The reader could find in these pages a lover without body to whom is seeking for the pleasure of the flesh. Could find what is love all about,in very way and taste: innocent, painfull,hot and tentantion. The book is short but it is full of excelent stories that it will keep you enjoying every minute until your done."
1,Haven't read it yet,I have not read it yet. I have not read it yet. I have not read it yet. Enough words.
4,Doesn't work with all kids.,"This is an excellent book and it's highly effective. However, all children function differently and respond differently to different types of discipline. This doesn't work on all kids, but no type of discipline does. As a teacher you have to see what works for your students."
2,Not for me,"This book is well written and the authors truly believe in their plan. I was looking for a book that would give me a ""magic trick"" to work for my 3-5 boys in each class that cause me so much frustration. I am not a grumpy person so I find that children tend to take my kindness for weakness. They don't seem to care much about punishment and I am tired of bribing with treats on my own dime like other teachers. My school doesn't use ""time outs,"" so it would be hard to implement this plan if I wanted to.I will stick with my ""Give me Five"" from Wong and tiles/rewards system for this year. I guess what I am looking for has to fit my own style and my school policies this particular system is a bad fit for me. If anyone could recommend another book that addresses problematic behavior in young boys, as well and other non-yelling strategies please let me know."
3,Fourth volume of six,"All of BUENA VISTA's ""Cartoon Capers"" videotapes clock in at under a half hour, with only three animated shorts per edition. The first here is a Fleischer work, the second comes from PARAMOUNT's Famous cartoon division and the last is a Technicolor MGM classic.This fourth edition in the series (subtitled ""Toys Will Be Toys"") features:AN ELEPHANT NEVER FORGETS (1935) - Young pachyderm gets revenge on an ape for bothering him in school.TOYS WILL BE TOYS (1949) - At night a toy shops denizens animate and parade for their princess. Features singalong: ""Oh, You Beautiful Doll.""TO SPRING (1936) - Gnomes prepare to paint the white Earth at winter's end. Tour-de-force of animation skills dazzles with its color swirls and infinite detail.RELATED ITEM:CARTOON CAPERS, VOL. 5offers these animations: ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" ""The Ski's the Limit"" and ""Peeping Penquins."""
5,the continuing journey of forgiveness,"Forgiveness is the key to real freedom. The path to forgiveness is not always easy. The renewal of the act of forgiving makes the path easier to travel. The road to forgiveness becomes smoothly paved as we forgive and keep on forgiving. Our journey gets easier with each trip down the original path, leading to the paved road of freedom and happiness. See chapter 14, Not a step but a Journey."
5,"Forgiveness, true forgiveness is a gift.",This book gives good examples of true forgiveness. I mean the kind of forgiveness that really heals minds and souls. Reading about how others with deep wounds can forgive will help readers to realize that this gift of peace and healing is available to each of us through prayer.
5,"Captivating, Exciting, Romance, Action ...",Contact is a superb Sci Fi romance - I LOVED this book! Susan Grant packs so much into each book - I was even close to tears a couple of times and I am *so* not a crier! I'd LOVE to read a sequel if one is ever written!
2,Had a hard time finishing,"This book was difficult for me to read. The idea of an airplane being grabbed out of the air and then released back month's later was a little far fetched for me. It was a slow read and boring until the very last few chapters. I usually keep my books to read again, but I threw this one away."
5,A real page-turner!,"""Contact"" is one of the best paranormal romances I've ever read. Fresh, unique, with great world-building and fully-realized characters, this book was a joy to read! It's about an airplane that is hijacked by aliens -- a silly, unrealistic-sounding premise that somehow turned into a gripping, absorbing, completely realistic-feeling book. Not silly at all. In fact, it's a real page-turner.Very good read. Recommended."
4,Good read,"I am a new fan of Susan Grant. This is the fourth book of hers that I have read. It was good, but not quite at the top of her form. Her best that I've read so far is The Star Princess, but this one is a good book to curl up with on a stay-at-home night."
1,Lack of information,"The split system heat pumps lack important info. and that is power rating. What are the watts, amps? I see the 21 SEER rating that's good, but I need to know the watts and amps to calculate the the power usage."
5,Beautiful photography!,"My husband and I recently used our time share in Nusa Dua, Bali. It was a delightful experience, and this book is a wonderful souvenir of our stay on the island. The seafood at Jimbaron Bay was mouthwatering, and I can hardly wait to recreate some of the recipes in this book. It is unusual to find a book that combines the culture, beauty of the island, and food preparation as well as this does. It is a great buy!"
5,Why Discontinue the BEST Light dressing on the Market?,"Kraft Light Red Wine & Vinegar Dressing was the best dressing!!! We used it for 30 years. Itdid not taste like a ""light"" dressing, nor God forbid, did it taste like ""Fat-free."" I actually rememberthe first time I tasted it and asked the hostess what kind of dressing she used on the salad. I wentright out and bought it and never stopped using it. I NEVER write in anywhere about grocery product changes except Ihad to this time because our family really misses it and I hope Kraft brings it back....thenI'll probably stock-pile it in the basement. Just in case."
5,Simply Italian...,1. Slice medium tomatoes (6-7 ea) in round shape and put them in a plate nicely overlapped each other.2. Sprinkle the chopped red onion (1/2 medium) to cover the tomotoes.3. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese (2 cup) on the top of the red onion.4. Sprinkle a little bit of basil (dry or fresh) to flavor if you have. Can be omitted.5. Pour Kraft Redwine Vinegarette Dressing when served.* The amount of ingredients is only to give you some ideas. It is subject to change per your taste.
4,"A solid album, especially for a generally bland genre","Pop-punk is generally bland, but bands like Allister seem to prove there are always exceptions.This album doesn't feature anything particuarly groundbreaking, but it does offer better guitar work and lyrics then what most pop-punk bands offer, and that right there is reason enough to give this band (especially this album) a shot. Who cares if they fall into a subdivision of punk that isn't classified as ""true"" punk? Give this album full of catchy songs a shot, and judge for yourself."
5,ABSOLUTE BEST,"allister just may be the best band in the world. i absolutly fell in love with this cd. i saw them in concert, they were amazing. if you dont have this cd in your player right now you HAVE to go get it. wherever you get it, it doesnt matter what the price is, its worth it. BUY THIS CD."
4,I'm almost ashamed to admit how much I like this,"I'm not going to pretend this album is anything other than it is. It's straight-forward radio-friendly pop-punk, similar to the likes of blink-182 and Simple Plan. And yet, there's something about it that I honestly like. The songs are catchy and well-written, and for the most part, they avoid falling into the whiney emo trap. Sure, it's almost undisputable that sooner or later these guys will completely sell out and have their faces plastered all over MTV so that the teeny-boppers can scream about how cute they are. When that happens, I will complain and call them poseurs and all the usual stuff, but this album will always be a guilty pleasure for me."
5,absolutely fabulous!,"I own this album, but before i had never heard of this band-I was really missing out! they may not have really made it big but this album is one of my very favourites- EVERY song on it is brilliant! I really couldnt pick a favourite, they are all really catchy and I think everyone will enjoy this if you enjoy pop punk kinda bands and don't want anything too heavy as this nears pop, but SO MUCH BETTER!Also, i have seen these live in birmingham and they are so fantastic- one band that really can play great live- i would definately recommend going to see them if you get the chance."
5,Farewell my Enemy,If you like allister and liked showoff check out chris from showoff's new band farewell my enemy at www.farewellmyenemy.com they are awesome.
4,ummm,yeah this is a great cd i recommend it to neone try it even if u didnt like dead ends and girlfriends because i didnt either and im glad i got this great cd
5,AMAZING CD!,"YO everyone ALLLISTER is a...amazing band. If ya like punk/ pop-punk then these guys will...rok ur sox!! My FAV picks on the cd are Matchsticks, Overrated (which is the single), Somewhere Down on Fullertown, Radio Player, and Waiting for you. but teh whole cd is amazing. I highly recommedn this to any one and everyone!!!"
3,Poppy Pop-Punk,"Allister is okay. Not the greatest, but quite respectable.Their songs are all extremely fun to listen to and are written quite well.But I don't know, they lack SOMETHING. I can't put my finger on it, but something seems like it's not there.If you like pop-punk (stuff like Simple Plan), power pop (stuff like All-American Rejects), you'll like Allister."
5,Damn good CD!...,One of the few cd's I own that I can listen to all the way through without skipping around! I first saw ALLiSTER at warped tour '02 and I had only known 2 of their songs. After the show I had to get the whole cd. This high enegry cd is just as good as their high energy shows. This is one damn good cd!...
4,Did what we asked of it,"We decided to learn more about opera in general, so we bought a bunch of CDs in our attempt to educate ourselves in more depth. This CD helped in that goal. What more can we ask?"
5,WOW!,I love opera so this was an easy one for me to like! If you close your eyes you can imagine listening to this by a crackling fire while getting a massage. I debated getting two of these as I know I'm going to wear this one out!
4,essence of opera,"This music cd has really essential pieces of great operas. If you don't have many classical cds, why don't you buy this one and enjoy~? :)"
5,Fantastic Music For SF/F fans,"Filk Music is a fiction reader's dream. Music based on books, popular culture and most of all science fiction and fantasy. Ecklar is the cream of the crop. Divine Invention has some great songs. Crane Dance, (based on Karate Kid), Crimson and Crystal and Terminus Est. These are great tunes guaranteed to inspire you and to thrill your imagination. I only hope she produces more CD's! And quickly. Oh, and Ecklar's voice is quite a joy to listen to! A MUST for science fiction fans!"
5,Unbelievably exciting and vein popping music,"These guys are without peer in the music world (in my opinion.) Little Jack Melody's writing is top notch, kind of a mix between raucous show tunes and sophisticated pop, the tunes run the gamut of jazz, klezmer, tango, bossa, variety show and every other musical genre you can think of. The band, which I found out are all current or former music students, is outstanding able to interpret Melody's music with swift precision. Get this album!"
1,OZ -2nd,Bought for a friend as she doesn't have internet. My family and I don't watch stuff that has all the trash contained herein.
5,Son loves,My son is very happy that He is getting this collection thanks to his mom! I am happy with the service.
5,Episodes Just Keep Getting Better,Season two offers even more character development and tension. You can help but get drawn into these inmates' lives in the stark reality of a maximum security prison.
4,Good,This series isn't for everyone.The series does portrays the stark realities of prison life and is well written. Don't purchase 2nd season without seeing 1st season.
2,great show but not worth the money,"this is an awesome show, but the bang for the buck simply isn't there.an 8 episode dvd set for 55+ dollars?are you mad?other than that it really is a great show, and I would snag this up quick if it were priced accordingly.29.99 anyone?"
2,"Anticlimactic at best, I did not like this...","After the first season, I expected to be blown away by the second one, so I bought it immediately. I was so wrong. The season finale was just bad. I won't spoil it for you, but there is no build-up like the first season, no event that closes the season--or, at least, not one that you saw building up in earlier episodes. The finale is just another episode. Bad, bad, season. I'll rent season 3, then I'll decide if I'll buy it.This season seemed to cater to shock-value more than storytelling.The reviews here seem to talk about the show itself, not this season. Now I know why. You have been warned."
5,A great follow-up to the first season.,"Season 1 ended leaving all of us in question about what happend after the whole riot incident occured. We were left in confusion as to just who died, who lived, and what the punishment would be to the prisoners. Luckily, the first episode of season 2 goes into detail about the aftermath of the riot aznd answers all of our much-asked questions.Season 2 further develops all the characters, adds great new storys, and introduces one of the most consistent and greatest storylines of Oz history: The bizarre Beecher-Keller love story. This season may have it's share of boring moments, but it's an overall great DVD set."
5,Oz is kind of over-priced but I love it,Oz was one of the best shows on tv and im very upset that it is off. I was very excited to purchase this dvd but i agree with some others when they say that it is kinda over-priced. it may be expensive but its worth the money cause i love this show
4,A slight downgrade from Season 1,"The first season of Oz hooked me. I thought the story-lines were strong, and the characters were fascinating. While there was lots of violence, things didn't seem over the top.Alas, season 2 goes overboard. Some of the story-lines make you roll your eyes. A few incidents seem too forced, and there is way too much drama. It really isn't becoming of a HBO drama; if I wanted that type of show, I'd go with a show like ER.I should note that the writers thankfully fixed that problem in Season 3."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I just purchsed the first three seasons. Unfortunately for me, the close caption for hearing impared in only in Spanish... No English... In fact even when I select NONE for the close caption, the wording is still coming across the bottom of the screen in Spanish.. How can anyboby put out a dvd without English close captioned.. I mean we are in America right????"
3,Cute,"This is cute but it is much bigger than I anticipated. I should have gotten out the ruler - duh! Still, I'm glad I bought it."
4,Great gift for a golf lover,"I bought this as a Christmas gift last year for my (former) boss and his family. He, his wife, and their two sons, are all avid golfers, so it seemed like a great gift. It's something the entire family could enjoy together. They all seemed to really like it."
4,blushfully exquisite,"The awkwardness & fascination of this pathetically sensative character(Cartaxo) brought back memories of my own adolescence. I was glued to the screen. Her vulnerability & innocence was painful to watch, yet I was touched by the films honesty. The ending is quite sad and unexpected, but isnt that what makes notable film?I never forgot this film, nor how it effected me. This is a film that I wish I had taped when I first saw it in 88'.A must see for lovers of the romatically bazzaar."
4,The Star,The movie is great for people who like to know about other cultures. Even though it can look and sound different there are a lot of things that touch your heart.
4,Excellent brief exposition of the Quapaw tribe's history.,"This book presents an excellent exposition of the history of the Quapaw people. The author, David Baird, has masterfully presented a condensed yet thorough history of the Quapaw nation which focuses on the Quapaw's ultimately destructive interaction with Europeans and Americans."
5,Unique method to make your American accent sound `real',"(CORRECTION TO VERSION 1) LINE 1: `FOUR' NOT FOR WEEKAfter I had completed a four week seminar at the Euro Center Language School in Alexandria, Virginia, my teachers gave me the best training marks a student ever got there: four `10's. Nevertheless, American native speakers were still able to detect my German accent in my English. Then I found Ann Cook's AAT in a book store in Washington D.C. I started an intense training. Recently I attended an English class in Munich, Germany, where I live. The teacher, an American from New York, wanted me to leave the class room because she thought I was an American who wanted to pull her leg by coming to her class. By the way, it's never too late to start with AAT: I'm 60 years of age. Anybody can do it if he or she tries hard."
3,i love this books,"i think this book give all the chinese accent english learner.a possibleites to the correct english accent training.thanks the author ,and the editor."
5,The Living Workplace,This book is a stimulating read. It will challenge you to think about yourself in relation to your workplace and possibly even to re-examine your own definition of success.
1,disappointing,"I returned this iron the day after I bought it. It leaks water no matter what setting it is on....leaks is too mild a word. It pours water...and the vertical steam option is laughable. It absolutely does NOT even relax the wrinkles in curtains or any other fabric. When I tried to iron on the low setting, white marks appeared on the fabric. There was nothing about this iron that pleased me. I called customer service and they went through the same things that the pamphlet in the box tell you to do. Nothing improved the iron."
3,Good iron at a premium price.,"I've recently started ironing everything I wear. This made me yearn to ease the job with high end equipment. I bought this steam generator after reading the ""professional quality for the home"" reviews along with a Rowenta expert ironing board.After ~10 tanks (which go much faster than I expected) of tap water I can say that this is a VERY good iron and will get your clothes looking good...but not as if they were done at the cleaners. Compared to my girlfriends extreme budget iron I can see a difference...but compared to my Mother's Rowenta iron(non-steam generator type)..I can tell little difference.I took one star for the high cost and another due to the LONG waiting periods for the ""steam generator"" to generate steam, about ~10+ minutes when filled completely.For your average user, save some $ and get a typical iron as it is much more convenient as well."
1,leaks leaks leaks,"I was so excited when I saw a Bloomingdales store demonstration of this item and bought it on the spot. What a disappointment. This iron leaks water, no matter what setting you put it on. I have ruined several clothing items, due to either water spots or burned water spots. Waste of money."
2,I can't recommend this iron,"I purchased this iron 2 years ago even after reading a number of the negative reviews. First off - it has never gotten as hot as other steam irons I've owned even at the highest setting. In fact, it seems to have gotten ever cooler (over the years I've owned it) the point now that I feel that I'm going to have to replace it. I also had the problem with leaking - it can really cause a mess. I've never owned a Rowenta before but I hear they make good products. This one though is a dud."
1,Terrible!!!,"I've owned a couple EuroPro pressure irons over the past 12 years and absolutely loved them! When it came time to replace my last iron, I decided to give Rowenta a try. NEVER AGAIN!!!! First, as many have said, this iron does spit and spew water over whatever is being ironed. Also, the iron doesn't remain hot. It seems to turn itself off from time to time, which (I believe) is what's causing the spewing of water. I've had to rewash several items due to the spewing water and white streaks that are causeed by this. Color me VERY UNHAPPY with Rowenta!By the way, I do own a wonderful EuroPro ironing board that has a shelf underneath for the tank."
2,Defective On/Off Switch!!,"I bought this iron from elsewhere 3 years ago. It has been by far, the best iron I have ever owned. I used it when I had lots of ironing because it takes so long for the water to heat for the steam, but I still loved using it. I never had any problems with water leaking, but I did start to notice how hot the equipment became with extended use. Then, just yesterday, it quit working right in the middle of my ironing marathon. I believe this iron has a MANUFACTURING DEFECT and that it should be recalled. We took it apart to see if we could figure out what the problem was and discovered the connections had burned out and melded to each other!! If you purchase this iron, make sure to get extended warranty, but make sure the extended warranty covers the electrical components. I will hot purchase another iron from Rowenta."
1,Rowenta DG 5030,I had used this product for 3 to 4 years when its on/off switch went bad. The replacement part was $ 60/70 so I decided to buy a new one last year. I have hardly used this new one for 20 to 30 hours and have the same problem with this new one. These two are the most expensive irons I have owned. I like the iron when it works but I can not see how one can keep on buying new ones. Any suggestion to get it fixed.Rowenta DG5030 1750 Watt Pro Iron Steam Station with Stainless Steel Soleplate
1,Awful!!!,"Gave it one star because Amazon won't let you post with zero stars.Spits, spews and soaks!!!Gawd awful thing!!!Have owned 3 other regular Rowenta steam irons and they last about the preprogrammed three or four years each and did not spit, sputter or soak!!Save your money!"
1,DO NOT buy this iron!!,"I never write reviews, but I am so mad at this iron, I thought maybe if I write a review, it will help save someone else from making a HUGE mistake.. The iron leaks water and not just a little, it POURS out water all over the clothes. I sent it back for repair and they sent it back to me with a section highlighted in the manual for leaking water, you hold the iron over a towel and push the steam button a few times. This did NOT solve the problem. It still pours water on the clothes and makes a huge mess. It is so bad that if you are ironing something to wear, you will have to wait an hour for the item to dry before wearing. HORRIBLE.."
4,It is a good book.,Samantha Slade does not like babysitting her little brother or sister.She said they donot listen to her which they don't.They do not like her watching them ether.She got stuck watching them because their parents went out somewhere.They got on Samantha's nerve as much as she got on their nerves.She hes never babysat them before in her life that's what she said in the book.They kept arguing at each other.Finally their mother and father came back from where they came from.Then she told her parents how they were not listening to her.They also snitched on her to about her telling them what or what not to do.I like this book because it is interesting to read when you are bored or you have a book report you have to do for school.I like this book because the paragraphs is long enough to read a book at school for a book report.
1,Disappointing,"This book is a great disappointment! Bego's sequel to The Queen of Soul happens to be nothing more than what he clips from past articles! If you value your money, don't buy this book. Because all you will read is his first book on her and just old articles about her."
2,"I am of Russian descent, but this is extremely difficult listening.","The order in which the songs are put together takes too much concentration. My idea of enjoying this type of music is to sit back and listen, but I have not yet been able to get through the entire CD. My only regret is that I purchased one for my cousin as a birthday gift. We both enjoy our heritage, but this is not one of my favorite things. Sorry."
3,Doctor Zhivago soundtrack...not the movie!,"I was in such a hurry when purchasing this that I did not pay attention! Thought I getting the movie,but when it arrived it was the soundtrack. Have not listened to it yet.. oh well, my mistake."
5,great cd,delivery was quick and the cd works as advertised would buy again. If you liked the movie you'll like the music.
3,There is more to prayer than a pretty voice,"This music is acceptable as a type of opera but doesn't conform to accepted Orthodox Halacha. Repetition of words in scripture, the sonorous churchlike background choir, and the the fact that he prays the way He believes prayer SHOULD be rather than following what G-d has asked of us in Halacha, takes away from his skilled presentation and makes this an altogether uninspiring performance. While he is touted as one of the foremost cantors, I would take Yosselle Rosenblatt, Benzion Shenker or David Werdyger any day.This is my personal feeling, yours could very well differ."
4,Cutting Edge,"My class used this book as a text and resource in a course on Advanced Torts. While only sections of the book were assigned, I grew so interested in the subject matter that I read most of the rest on my own.The editors have collected some of the most outstanding texts in this area and compiled them for reference. Included are sections on critical feminism, queer issues, intergroup relations, the black-white binary, and crime issues. The top writers in the field are all included, such as Derrick Bell and Richard Delgado. While the book is easy to use, none of the texts are easy but rather are challenging of deeply-held ideas and ideals.As critical race and gender studies continue to proliferate in undergraduate colleges and law schools, I am sure that this text will recieve a great deal more attention. It is certainly a worthy and thought-provoking read."
5,Hauntingly beautiful,"I absolutely love this CD. I first discovered this group on some compilation album that featured ""Tut Hi Tschi, Man Hi Tschi"" and I became obsessed to find the album, which was no easy task, as it was fairly obscure even then. I believe I bought it from Amazon, unsure it was the right one. What a joy to have it, though. The musicians are virtuosi, the compositions are joyful and varied, and the melodies are memorable. It's a captivating mix of Gypsy folk, classical and Texas swing. Django Reinhart and Stephane Grappelli certainly made their stamp on the group, but so have Bob Wills, Chopin and Raymond Scott. Highly recommended."
4,Worked well!,"I had to heat up some Schedule 80 pipes that were stubbed out of a concrete pour. The instructions said Schedule 40 only, but it worked well on 1 inch Schedule 80 pipe."
2,"Stupid, boring and inappropriate","Take a top actor like Brad Pitt and stick him in any movie and it will instantly draw attention. This movie proves it. The story follows the life of Benjamin from birth through death, allowing you to share all his inappropriate moments and stupid mistakes. I personally found the concept of ""growing young"" rather ridiculous, and didn't find much interesting about the concept. All of the actors gave excellent performances. The only part of the movie I found enjoyable was actually hilarious--the shorts (pun intended) where the guy talks about being struck by lightning."
4,movie talkback,"Somehow, the english version did not work in my 1:5 dolby surround mode. I have to switch over to the french version. It would be perfect if not due to this blemmish"
2,"A Long, Dull Story I'd Heard Before","A poor man's Forrest Gump with an inexplicable gimmick tossed in. This really didn't need to be half as long as it was, and all the major scenes seemed like window dressing while the dull in-between moments were stretched out for as long as possible. It had a few charming scenes and some legitimately funny bits (especially the old man recounting his experiences with lightning) but give any film nearly three hours and a huge budget; the law of averages says it's bound to stumble across a few of those by sheer chance. Many of the character moments were forced and stiff, and there was almost zero chemistry between Blanchett and Pitt to back up their supposed lifelong passion for one another. Wrapping the whole story up into Hurricane Katrina just felt cheap and needless. A real disappointment."
1,poor quality,"The item arrived in a timely fashion. The first 45 minutes played very well with good picture quality, but after the 45 minutes the DVD begin to freeze then showed video artifacts on the screen eventually the DVD just froze and would not play. I removed the DVD and cleaned it very thoroughly and played it again, but the results were the same. contacted the seller and requested a refund and they provided a full refund. Very unhappy and the DVD has no useful purpose. It is not playable."
1,its worth half a star,"what a horrible movie!long, tedious , forest gump wanna be. bad actingwhat a mess, you will feel like hitting yoursel after you watch thisthe fx are awesome yes, but wasted herei rather watch white noise than having to go through this torture again"
3,A Poor Man's Forrest Gump,"Let me get this right out there, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a well made film with great acting. It just doesn't have any solid point but following the old young man until he is a young old man. Like anyone's life shown in whole, there is no climax and only a few interesting revelations which show themselves too early before the film's end. In short, everything that is done in this film was done much better in Forrest Gump and with more humor. The CGI process of making people look old and young is a true revolution in technology. It is thanks to that and everyone's fine acting that this got 3 stars from me. Worth a rental but not a buy."
2,One of the all-time best made bombs,"Oscar nomination or not, this is the most boring movie I've seen since MEET JOE BLACK. It's sad to see so much talent and effort gone to waste but what exactly is appealing about this story ? Why on earth would a little girl and a seemingly old man find themselves bonded to each other in the first place ? Why don't Guiness/Ripley or the media stop by when what you've got here is the ultimate freak story ?. The only fun I had throughout this movie was making a list of the similarities with Forrest Gump which run in the several dozens. The Katrina back-story could have been of interest but at the end, all they used it for is as an excuse to flood a room ! This movie has easily the best aging effects in history but you end up noticing you spend most of the time evaluating them instead of getting involved with the story which is the basic symptom that this movie fails."
2,Special Effects Galore,"Heh. An Overlong, romance infested demonstration of special effects and how they benefit the film.Special Effects?Boo-YahLots?YesRealistic?Miles from Realistic, My FriendsGOOD Special Effects Are Supposed To Be Realistic.Now My Criticism for the rest of the film:COMPLETE BOGUSEVERY SINGLE PERFORMANCE WAS A LOAD OF WET POOPThe Script Was Something Found In A Screenwriter's Trash CanIf You Still Want To View It, Rent It Before You Buy It."
4,Cradle to Grave in reverse,Very interesting story with many sub plots that are easy to follow. Acting is excellent by all the cast. Highly recommend.
3,Okay movie,"After watching this excessively long 2 hr and 46 minutes movie, I realized it was a cross between the movies ""Meet Joe Black"" and ""Forrest Gump"". Meet joe black also was a long movie and the dialogue was a bit tideous at times as was the case in Benjamin Button, not including the fact that both movies starred Pitt. As for the ""forrest gump"", both Benjamin and Forrest have an unusual aspect or trait to themselves and they love a woman who goes in and out of their lives. Overall, Benjamin Button is an okay movie, just not as good as it was touted to be. if you plan to watch it, get comfortable as it is long."
3,Peculiar,"I was not really impressed . . . I don't believe it was all that the advertisers said it would be. It did have moments where I thought it would change my impression, but no, it did't. It was no ""Meat Joe Black"" that's for sure. It was 'peculiar' but not as much as I though it would be.Larry"
4,Very good movie,"The premise of this movie was very, very interesting: a man, born in his eighties and ages backward through the course of his life.When Benjamin's mother died at his birth and his father saw the old looking, wrinkled infant, he panicked and left Benjamin Button on the steps of a retirement home in New Orleans.Thus begins the Curious Case of Benjamin Button. David Fincher (the director) takes us on a journey of a man who learns everything in reverse. He is ignorant while still an old man, and as he ages backwards, he becomes more knowledgeable and mature. We see Benjamin meet many people, all of whom he touches and changes their lives in some way.I was surprised by the sense of humor in this movie. It was genuinely laugh-out-loud funny in parts.It's really the best movie of its kind since 'Forrest Gump.'"
2,Too Weird for Me.,"Really wasn't impressed. Not a great plot, creative but not enticing. Acting was great but it was just odd. Wouldn't recommend buying it. Rent it if you really want to see it."
5,Wonderful Movie!!!,"Prior to seeing this movie, I had read the short story which I thoroughly enjoyed. That said, I was pleased and equally moved by the depth that the screen writer had given the story.The movie covered so many things...- rejection of those who are different- unconditional love of mother for her child- life and death- living life to the fullest no matter your age- falling in love- etc......So much was covered in this movie through the eyes of this simple man who was physically aging backwards...Anyway, it is a movie that leaves one thinking about life even when laughing at some of the humorous moments interspersed throughout....So, highly recommend this movie and what is great about getting the two disc edition is that the second disc shows you the process or birth of this film and unravels some of its technical mysteries...."
4,Intriguing and Thought Provoking,"My wife and I truly enjoyed this movie. I love the twist on reality and how it reminds us of many things including the ever-true, but often not listened to lesson that life is short and each of our journeys are unique, yet forever connected."
2,Couldn't relate to Benjamin,"Since the main character of the story is different from anyone who has ever lived, the burden was on the writer(s) to make him a person we can relate to. But I couldn't relate to him because there was little development of even one strong, lifetime relationship. His relationship with his adoptive mother isn't explored in depth, and he leaves his wife after a couple of years of marriage. He hardly knows his father; his boss dies; he has a short term lover. Benjamin Button is a man who allowed his differentness to shape his life at the crucial time when he needed to face it (ie., when he had a wife and daughter). I only watched the full 2 1/2 hrs. so I could say I had seen the whole thing."
3,Forest Gump all over again.,ok.... to be honest here i reeeeaaaally wanna give this movie a two. Why? Because after i left the theater I could have sworn i had just paid to see Forest Gump again (this might even be considered a spoiler) I'm not even exaggerating when i say the story lines are just about completely identical.I gave it an extra star because it did provide some interesting characters... i suppose the movie was sad but to be honest i couldn't see it through my aggravation... don't get me wrong... i enjoyed Forest Gump... but damn..
4,A little long!,"Loved this movie, especially Brad Pitt's part. ran a little long with some slow scenes, i think they could have shortened it a bit. although i do not regret purchasing."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I've seen some stinkers over the years but this takes the prize. A dreary, meandering tale about...? A guy growing younger and then what? The premise could have been interesting but sadly this was not only a waste of time (almost 3 hrs), it was a waste of $$ since I paid to see it at the theater. Granted, some movies are simply meant mindlessly enjoy and not think about too much, but to watch this mess you need to check your IQ at the door and/or get a lobotomy beforehand."
2,Uncurious and uncuriouser...,"Just throwing stars at what's a great story is counter-productive here. It's not surprising or unexpected. It's a short story that is stretched unimaginably into an unengrossoing overlength movie. They could have easily dispatched with a whole segment where Cate Blanchett simply fails to look both ways before crossing an intersection. The story THE CONFESSIONS OF MAX TIVOLI is more flushed out than BENJAMIN BUTTON and might have more meat for a movie. But all the same, this movie didn't need the Hollywood effect that was applied overthickly."
2,Not All That,"Director David Fincher tries desperately to make this plodding but beautifully photographed movie something magical, but the leaden, tin-eared script keeps the proceedings resolutely earthbound. Really, young screenwriters should be assigned the not unenviable task of watching ""Casablanca"" each and every day until creating memorable dialogue and characters becomes second nature. I have NO idea why this film was nominated for any Oscars other than the technical awards; it must have been the Fitzgerald story on which it was based."
5,Best Movie,"This is the best movie I have seen in a while, I had always wondered how it turned out in the end, if he goes to being a baby or not and my question was answered. Really great movie, good for a movie night with friends as well."
3,Should have been great !!!,"After all the hype around this movie, I was really looking forward to suspending reality for a couple of hrs and becoming engrossed in a great story. I was very disappointed in the result. Whilst no doubt a very strong cast in Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchett and a storyline that should transcend to the big screen, something got lost along the way. The film traced the life of a man born old and aging to become young. I found the film too long and for me it 'died' half-way through. That was the point where I stopped caring about Mr.Button, and could very easily have switched off. I perservered and staying to the end and though it did resurrect itself, I had already become bored with it. The film is too long and what should have been great became very average."
4,"Yeah, some unoriginal aspects, but I enjoyed the movie anyway...","Another reviewer pointed out a lot of parallels between this movie and Forrest Gump, given that they have the same director. Can't disagree with it, either. However, I still think it's an enjoyable movie to watch, as it has its own style and charm to it. And the special effects are undeniably amazing in how they make Benjamin an ""old baby.""SEMI SPOILER ALERT: The only part of the story I found corny and ""Hollywoodized"" is when Daisy beds Benjamin after she's remarried. She should have stayed true to her husband, who was nobly raising Daisy and Benjamin's daughter. ""I don't know why I'm here,"" she says when she shows up at his hotel room...yeah, right... END SPOILER ALERTOther than that, though, a fascinating story, and I loved all the various time-period settings. RECOMMENDED."
3,Benjamin Button,"A little tedious and long. It covered the relationship issue well, but I believe that there are many more questions and issues that could have been raised with more detail - body image, aging, feelings and thought going on in his mind, and more that I can't think of right now. In some ways it was too predictable, when I left the room and returned I could easily guess what had happened. I didn't even bother to push pause. Acting was acceptable, but not great. Generally, the kind of movie during which you can make a sandwich."
5,ONE OF MY FAVES,"THIS MOVIE CAN TOUCH THE HEART AND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY TOP MOVIES, I SAY RENT IT"
5,Love a good story,"This movie has a very interesting story with great acting. Gotta love it. It's similar to Forrest Gump to me, being that it's a long movie that plays out a very interesting chain of events. My DVD works great and was shipped in a timely manner."
3,Fair Film,"This movie had an interesting story and concept behind it. The backstory is great. The execution and story telling made this movie a long and slow moving story. I felt like I was a 16 year old listening to my grandfather telling me the story of his life on the farm. There was little of interest in the story from start to finish and it was painfully too long for the story involved.Additionally, the movie showcases weak morals and no real positive elements."
1,"Long, Dull, Boring and Way Over-Hyped","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button starts out slow, then slows down. The feeling you get watching it is ""is this going anywhere?"" The answer is no. It's not that it's a chick flick, because my wife felt the same way about it. The movie is pretentiously artsy without being artistic. The characters are developed so poorly you really don't care what happens to them. Save almost 3 hours of your life and avoid this movie."
1,A one time movie,"I really couldn't find any point to this movie. There is no plot to it. I just don't see the point of it. What were the producers trying to convey? I love movies with psychological twists. You know, those types of movies that take you into a world of possibilities. Besides the reverse aging idea, I can't think of anything that stands out from this movie. I can't even see myself watching this movie again."
1,Interminable Rip-Off,"Lotsa folks' reviews compare this interminable movie--filmed with state of the art effects about a strange simple southern man uttering nuggets of wisdom as he moves episodically through peace time and war time, on land and sea, befriended by eccentric characters, all the while in love with a childhood friend who comes in and out of his life--with ANOTHER interminable movie filmed with state of the art effects about a strange simple southern man, etc.... Could that be because ""Button"" screenwriter Eric Roth is also the guy who wrote ""Forrest Gump""?Cate Blanchett, quit telling your stupid story about the stupid old guy and just die already!"
2,The Curious case of Benjamin Button - DVD or Hardcover,I wanted to buy the hardcover book but wrongly clicked the DVD version. Big mistake. The website does not allow you to change or correct your order...
3,Depressing Account of Old Age and Death,"I have to agree with Hollywood that this movie was excellent for scene and costumes. But the story stunk!!From growing up amongst the elderly who pass away to becoming a baby who doesn't remember or know anyone around him, this movie disappointed me. It was full of death from the very beginning. The father, who never knew his son because he disowned him at birth, was typical.If you like crying at the end or seeing depressive scenes, this one's for you.I guess I was expecting a love story. . . NOT SO. Sure, two people fall in love and have a ""normal"" life for a brief period in time. Not realistic. Not scientific. Not fantasy. Not anything. Certainly not worth seeing in my opinion. I should have saved my money.G Gupton, author. ""The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment"" and ""Seekers of Truth"""
3,Roller Coaster Ride,"Time passes smoothly with this long, uniquely premised movie which is a testament to the directors, actors, script writers and editors. But, for the audience it's a roller coaster ride viewing experience. It vacillates between being profound with it's (Fitzgerald's) thoughts on life & death and being wearisomely mundane (long journeys on tugboats & motorcycles) and unbelievable (souls becoming hummingbirds at sea). So, I give it an average of 3 stars."
2,Not Impressed,I enjoy Brad Pitt Movies and I LOVE Cate but this movie just doesn't say Academy Award to me.
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE,"For a character study to be successful, one needs to LIKE the characters. Not possible here. Benjamin is cold, unfeeling, and abandons his wife when she needs him most. Benjamin practically never speaks during the entire movie and is void of any emotion throughout. And the wife...a loose, amoral person who sleeps with anyone and is always gloomy and depressed. All in all, this movie is simply an exercise in special effects and make-up, period. For anything else, Benjamin Button SUCKS. Steer clear of this turkey."
4,Blu Ray & Benjamin,David Fincher is probably one of my favorite directors and in this mysteriously magical film you appreciate his visual style so much more through Blu Ray.
2,Not Worth the Time or Money,This movie had very good cinematography and decent aging and reverse aging effects as well as good acting. Unfortunately these could not help a very boring movie.
5,heartwrenching yet beautiful,"I am not going to recap what the tale is about as enough people have done so already. What I will say is that this movie will break your heart.As Benjamin says ""nothing ever lasts.""Cate Blanchett is absolutely exquisite in this role. Brad Pitt also brought great warmth and charm to the portrayal of Benjamin. I was shocked that this movie was directed by David Fincher as it is very different from his previous films. Kudos also to Tilda Swinton who has a wonderful cameo as the wife of a Russian diplomat who has a dalliance with Mr. Button."
1,"Fitzgerald, twisted","F. Scott Fitzgerald made ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" a poignant but whimsical and often funny tale of a man born old who grows young. Hollywood twists this short story beyond recognition.In Fitzgerald's version, the father is discombobulated but takes his gray-haired, withered newborn home and has him dye his hair and otherwise try to masquerade as a young 'un. The film father tries to drown and then abandons his son. Fitzgerald's Benjamin woos and marries the belle of the ball; as she ages, he uses his burgeoning energy to attend parties and master the latest dance steps. In the big screen version, romance ends in tragedy.Thus does the film convey Hollywood's idea of a serious message, to wit, ""Life sucks, then you die."" Some reviewers have noted the similarity to 1994's FORREST GUMP. Was that the last time a Hollywood movie with a happy ending won Best Picture?This reviewer is happy the Jazz Age master isn't around to see what they did to his odd little yarn."
5,Timeless movie,TIMELESS story that everyone should own or at least see. can never be replicated or forgotten. The characters are wonderful and it is great for men and women alike.
4,Loved this movie.,"I loved everything about this movie. The technical stuff was absolutely brilliant, but the story was so good, you kind of forgot about it. Which is the way it should be."
2,Booorrrriiiiinnnngggg,"First off, the short story was much better. This movie-rendering got bogged down in the uninteresting and unemotional love story between Button and what's her name. Made no sense and dragged horribly. (Wife went to bed in the middle of it and I fell asleep twice). Almost comical rendering all in all, and barely, just barely two stars. And what did the hurricane have to do with anything??????? Hollywood blows it again."
2,Borefest,"This is an overlong, overly dull and a bit too full of itself for it's own good. The story is not interesting, the characters are boring and the plot just never really amounts to much.I love a great Drama but this is just melodramatic nonsense."
1,Do I have to give this film 1 star?,"There honestly needs to be an option for zero stars. This movie is flat out terrible.The movie looked odd to me from the beginning. But I started reading a recap of it on IMDb and it intrigued me. I got about two paragraphs into a full recap (barely getting into any anything about Benjamin) before deciding that the movie looked really interesting and that I wanted to see it.So I rented the movie Friday night.It's nearly a three hour movie. With a movie that long, a slow start can't be afforded, but I got an hour into the movie before becoming so bored that I had to give up. The movie was just so dull and boring, going nowhere, which is a shame, because it was such an interesting premise for a movie (aging backwards) yet the movie fails so miserably by never going anywhere.Why this movie is so hyped, I'll never understand."
2,Recipe For A Hokey Hybrid,"Mix several parts ""Titanic"" with ""Forrest Gump"" and ""The Jerk""; fold in elements of ""Back to the Future"" along with the atmosphere and diction from a Tennessee Williams play. Stir at length until mixture becomes stiff and heavy before baking for two hours and forty-six minutes, preferably while a CAT 5 hurricane is bearing down on you.I didn't recognize anything remotely reminiscent of F. Scott Fitzgerald in the result; but if this formula sounds appealing to you, you'll love ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button""."
3,"Good movie, until the end....","This is a great ""feeling"" movie...but it got a little ridiculous towards the end, when he strated shrinking and becoming a little boy and BABY again....I think it would have a been MUCH BETTER ending had he died at about 25 or so, cause we all know it's impossible to shrink bone and organs....I mean geeze! Otherwise, it was a great movie.Gotta add:""Did I ever tell you I've been struck my lightni'n 13 times?"" haha!Enjoyable movie. Just wish it had had a more believeable ending."
2,Nay,Boring and fell asleep trying to understand what's going on. Someone else may find it better but it wasn't for me
4,movie review,"I have watched this movie over and over, it was enjoyable and i loved Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchette. it was very believable for the story line. A good fiction. Good battle scene for a human nature movie."
4,An Attention Grabber,"It's extremely rare these days to watch a movie with exceptional special effects that actually offers a well executed storyline, which is what I discovered about the actual movie. Actors took a strong hold of their respective roles and made you a believer.The second disc was of special interest to me because I am always curious about the ""behind the scenes"" extras and ""making of"" documentaries. This 2 disc edition did not disappoint me."
2,"Hmmmmm, Surprisingly Boring","This film has Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton, two actresses destined to become Hollywood legends because of their incredible acting ability. It also has Brad Pitt, destined to become a Hollywood legend because he is some 'serious' eye candy. But almost three hours of ""Forrest Gump For The Twenty-first Century"" when we just got over that first piece of crap...I dunnnnoooooo. Watch at your own risk."
1,SLOW,"This movie was very disappointing, and too slow - even with the great cast I turned it off halfway -"
2,Wasted effort,"I can't believe this movie was made by David Fincher. This is the guy who had directed 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club', two movies that are totally mind-bending and truly amazing. This movie is as confused as it can be. It tries to be a romance, a biography, a drama and perhaps a science fiction too, but sadly, succeeds at none. Many people are complaining that it's slow and long. That's still OK with me if the movie has something interesting or new to tell. It's really annoying to see it to be so 'Forrest Gump'-style and so pure sugary syrup. The idea of reverse aging could have been interesting if treated differently, but now when I think about the movie, it just makes me chuckle.I stopped watching a hour and a half into the movie. I kind of knew what was in store and didn't want to regret wasting another hour and a half.David Fincher, Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett -- it's sad to see so much talent go to waste."
3,"Didn't hate it, but wasn't my cup of tea.","Curious Case of Benjamin Button is the type of movie made for Academy Award season. Based on a F. Scott Fitzgerald story, we witness a man who is born old and ages backwards. It is an interesting premise, and the acting is well done. Brad Pitt plays the lead role, and shows off his skills while portraying Benjamin at different ages. Taraji P. Henson gives an academy award-nominated performance as the motherly figure who takes him under her wing, and Cate Blanchett plays the love of his life. The story spans several years, even generations. The makeup department did an amazing job at portraying this. The main issue I have with the movie is that it is entirely too long. By the time the most emotional part of the story came along, it was nearly three hours later and there wasn't enough to keep me interested until then."
3,born at the point of death living backward,"The human element of time is explored her in emotionalrelationships. The old man / baby is brought up by a nursing homenurse who is all heart. Benjamin experiences life and lovein a way very different than the rest of us.I liked the movie and it reminded me of an F. Scott Fitzgeraldshort story about reversed time that I read in high school.The plot may not be entirely new, but the make up and actingis very well done.We see history in a unique prospective."
2,"Trying to be too much, with too little.","Felt like a Forest Gump type of movie, without the humor or compelling storyline. The movie encapsulates every sense of the word dull, and while an interesting concept, the overdrawn length of the movie coupled with a daily regret I now have for loosing 3 hours of my life while watching this forces me to hand it a 2 star rating. There are movies made so you don't have to think, and movies made to provoke thought and discourse. This movie promotes a drab, dry in between that leaves you wondering what else might have been accomplished during the time it took to watch the movie."
3,A very Odd Romance,"This film is best described as two ships passing eachother in the night.The essence of the film is about a man who is aging backwards, who falls in love with a woman who is aging normally. The process of time eventually takes its toll on their relationship.It is a melancholy tale, of interest is the CG effects, that provides an unusual set of aging effects for Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt).In my opinion, this is more of a rental, than a collector's piece."

4,Good condition for a used book.,"I'm reading this book because my best friend recommended it since I prefer historical fiction. I haven't finished reading the book yet, but I am enjoying it. And considering the book was printed in 1962 and is a used copy, it's in very good condition."
5,Great tea party toy for your little princess,This is a great quality toy. Nice pictures of the princesses and pretty pastel colors for the dishes and utensils. My daughter loves having tea parties and this is the nicest set we have had so far.
5,This Movie Will Leave You Stunned!,"Eye Of God is the type of movie that will leave you thinking about all of it's many facets and twists and turns for days and maybe weeks after viewing it! It will capture you from the first few minutes and not let you go until the very end. It makes you ponder about how such different people's lives can become so inexplicably intertwined with such disasterous results. And it hits the nail on the head with it's portrayal of a dangerous zeolot's self-rightgeous actions in the name of God; something that is all too common in todays news.Along with a gripping story, the acting and the editing make this movie a must see. I think it is one of the best movies I have ever viewed. Please bring it back into production; I want to buy this one for my video library."
4,Nice But Predictable,"Ex-con murders his new gullible wife. We see it coming a mile away. I do like how it focuses on the reactions of the young witness, probation officer, and local sheriff. This captures the charm and slow pace of a small town but also it's isolation. People make bad choices because they feel there is nothing better to do. The acting makes up for the somewhat flat script."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A meditative and often slow picture, Eye of God is a movie to admire more than enjoy: all the pieces are there, including a quietly-powerful performance by Hal Holbrook, but it's just never that captivating a film."
4,watch this movie!,"this movie touched me deeply. the acting was wonderfully real. the movie is a told through the events of two different poeple's lives. one, a young traumitized boy, and the other, a young, naive woman. At the end you see how their two lives where connected. I really liked how this movie was put together. the story continually goes back and forth between the two characters. the ending is filled with many climactic scenes that will leave a indelible image in your head. It made me cry. If you like touching movies, you should see this movie. Hurry...buy it!"
3,Too low cut for comfort,"I love halter bathing suits but this one is far too low cut, almost down to your waist. The cover up is cute and it's comfortable but I have to wear a shirt over the suit to wear it in public."
1,All I can say is that it sucks,"Ya heard me! If The C Programming Language is too terse for you, then just go with C for Dummies. Reasons it sucks - 1. The Author's writing style is horrible. I hate it. 2. There really is no point in his examples, they do the same thing you could do with just a printf() function(Ex. To demonstrate the use of a variable, he prints something that could be printed by using the printf() command) 3. There are plenty of other books. Go with The C Programming Language if you have past programming expierence. If you don't, then go with C for Dummies."
2,"How ""not"" to learn anything.","I suppose I might have learned more from this book had the programming examples been compatible with the compiler included on the cd in the book. However, since none of Zhang's examples would execute with the Borland Compiler version included I can not give this book an unbiased rating."
3,Not too good on the 'WHY' of C programming,"I am only a beginner programmer, and found that the book was pretty easy to follow.I was however, a bit disappointed by the fact that the author never really explained very well WHY you use these valuable functions, pointers, arrays, etc.Also, I thought that the exercises at the back of each chapter tended to throw you in the deep end towards the end of the book. I found I was constantly refering to the answers in the back of the book to figure everything out, which doesn't build your confidence much! I think they would have been better having more exercises in each chapter to complete, starting off very simply and then getting harder in order for you to really grasp the concepts.On the plus side though, the book is short and concise and allows you to whiz through the C language. Then you can move on more quickly to fry bigger fish - C++ and windows programming!"
2,Not your first choice.,"You can't really beat the price point, but you get what you pay for: a cheap book that leaves you to puzzle over unproofed code that seg faults, to work out the theoretical model of C's operation on your own, and to wonder, what, exactly, real-world, practical applications of the various functions might be. If you've ever wanted to read forty pages all about ""Hello World"", but three paragraphs on how to code across multiple files, this is your book. Otherwise, do yourself a favor, and spend those 24 hours of C with a superior tutorial, or god forbid, a real instructor."
4,Fascinating,Wilson does an excellent job creating the connections (no pun intended) for lay persons of neural networking and and the evolutionary and revolutionary way the hand operates in three dimensional space. A must read for educators and anyone else who has an interest in brain development.
4,Fascinating,"This book is deep. I'll need to read it two or three times to understand its implications. Its thesis is that the human hand, with its range and complexity of movement, its ability to control external objects, and its interrelationship and parallel development with the brain, has enabled our uniquely human capacity for thought, communication and creativity. Its stated mission is to discover the ""physical roots"" of this evolutionary development. Fascinating and well written. Great stuff."
3,The Hand...,"Fascinating chapters on the difference between a human hand and a chimp hand, on the skill of the marionette master, on the function of the thumb, and on the skill of the juggler. It was also surprising that half the book was a defense of Darwinism along the lines of Dawkins. There is no book that I know of like it in the good chapters and I would like much more in this area. It is a waste of paper in the Darwinism chapters if you have already read or don't want to read Dawkins."
3,History of people who discovered Coelacanth,"First, this is not a natural history, but it is an an engaging if not too critical tale of several scientists who were involved in discovering the Coelacanth.The scientific information of the whole book is about as much as one would expect from a feature article in the Science section of a better newspaper, nothing more, but the people involved are interesting enough and the book reads very easily. On the whole I can't really reccomend but I enjoyed myself. ""A Fish Caught in Time"" reminded me a lot of the sorts of science books that used to be popular for clever kids back in the day.As an aside there is an interesting, and very English, anti-French quality to the book. And for a journalist, its relentlessly upbeat and sunshiney tone is unusual these days for a book that is pretty much biographical sketches involving South Africa."
2,Incorrect Information,"Since when did all fish other than the coelacanth and sharks have only one dorsal fin?...in Appendix A under ""Fins and Scales"": ""apart from sharks, all other fish have one dorsal fin only.""What about mullets (Mugilidae), drums (Sciaenidae), darters (Percidae), and a whole host of other fish that have two dorsal fins? Some of them might not be separated by a whole lot of space, but there's definitely two.Could understand if it seemed like a typo, but this just seems to be an exaggeration of how special the coelacanth is. Coelacanths are special just by themselves; they don't need lies to make them seem any more so.It's possible that if I weren't such a fish enthusiast I would've enjoyed this book more."
5,A Fish Caught In Time,"Samantha Weinberg has written a wonderful book outlining the history of the coelacanth. This ""living fossil"" fish, which predates the dinosaurs, was believed to have been extinct for millions of years until one was pulled from the sea in 1938. This incredible discovery has been referred to as the ""number one zoological find of the twentieth century."" The coelacanth, with it's primitive limbs, is a fascinating member of our evolutionary past. Much more than just a fish story, A FISH CAUGHT IN TIME tells an exciting tale of the many individuals involved in expanding our knowledge of the coelacanth--and hopefully preventing it's extinction as we enter the twenty-first century.This is one of those special books that was hard to put down and ended far too soon!"
4,A Great Companion to the Book,"Reading the book of the same name prompted me to purchase this DVD and I was not disappointed. It provided the same atmosphere, despair, anger, amazement, etc however I highly suggest you read the book first. As with all movies made from a book, you lose a little something because of the time constraints but this is a good way for the kids/teenagers to wet their American/Black history appetite. It is also a good way for the family to view it together and to discuss it, after, each chapter and get immediate feedback. One way or the other, you can't watch this movie and not be moved. The movie is a must in your DVD collection."
4,More About The Reverne Nat Turner Is Approiate,Fairness Journalism Especially (PBS) along with all the other networks who claim Obective Journalism To Produce and Expose Greater Information About Blacks Whom Fought and Fight as True Rebells Of The Bigotry Within This Country (The United States) and Around The World.

4,"Great ""Moments"" not great Opera","In most cases, yes, great moments, not all 'should' be considered great Opera. WELL worth the purchase however IF you can find it. As to the Roberta Peters debate, F# or high F ... who cares, the tone and musicality was way off base, she may be a soprano, but a coloratura she is not! She was all over the place in ""Una voce pocco fa"".. it was painful to listen to (but then you have got to remember that Rudolf Bing ran the Met during her time .. need I remind you he was a floorwalker in a British department store before running the Met, his taste was suspect to say the LEAST! he proved a tin ear more than once!) ... I'm with you, too on Eillen Farrell.. there was a reason she was the ""Crossover Queen"", that is the area her voice was more suited to perform. Rewind, forward or next track to Beverly Sills' ""O luce di quest' anima"" to hear true coloratura ~ Worth your purchase price alone!"
5,The perfect size journal for scribblers,"I love all the paperblanks journals. They are the perfect size (144 pages 5X7), come in a variety of beautiful covers, have acid free paper and take pen and ink well (no seepage thru the page.)The only quibble I have is that this particular journal is called French Bleu and indicates by the picture, title and description that it is blue and green.These journals are solid purple, with purple ribbons, and purple leather strips on the side. So if you like purple, you will be in heaven."
1,Don't waste your time,"This is by far Tartan's worst release. For a distributor that has brought us great titles as The Booth, the vengeance trilogy and else, this is scary at its lowest. The legend of the ghost is explained in other reviews, and it is quite interesting, to say the least. But this pseudo movie is not even that. Directed by a long-time contributor of B-movies (check his filmography), The Ghost of Mae Nak fails to be scary, is not stylish, and not even interesting. But it certainly is predictable, boring, lame, has the worst dialogues you'll hear in a long time, and it is plainly mediocre. Perhaps it is the style of the westerner director, he has shown that he likes/loves Thailand (Butterfly Man), but his skills as a director are not enough to create anything interesting.Watch Shutter, that one is truly creepy and is told by Thais who really understand Thai and know how to film. Don't waste your time with this dud."
5,Ghost of Mae Nak,If you like the movie the Ring you would love movie Ghost of Mae Nak. This movie having a really nice Twist to it.
3,Disappointing,"I listened to this CD after hearing Georg Tintner's CD of the original, 1872 version of the score. Karajan utilizes cuts from Bruckner's 1876 version, along with its reversal of the 2nd and 3rd movements. After hearing the original version, I just find that I can't listen to Karajan's CD comfortably. It is 11 minutes shorter than Tintner's, and I find that the music needs more time than Karajan's text gives it to spread its wings. With the 1876 cuts, the piece's tunes just seem to collide with one another without any logic. Also, the slow movement really belongs third, as in Bruckner's 8th. For those listeners who still like Karajan's version of the score, I should note that his performance is very well played, but features early digital sound engineering that is much too close up and lacking in tonal allure. Nevertheless, I would urge all Brucknerians to hear Tintner's recording. It firmly places the 2nd among the greatest of this composer's works."
5,It's worth living through Relief Society just to read this p,This book proves all over again that the unbearable can be made tolerable -- even wonderful -- by a sense of humor. Anyone who has sat through countless Mormon meetings without losing her mind will find it hilarious.
5,Mormon (and EX-Mormon!) Laughs,"I didn't think I could have as much fun as to sit within an audience watching as Laurie Mecham turns into Fonda AlaMode [as well as into Fonda's daughter, Crystal]. But this book is that much fun! It would be wonderful if Ms. Mecham could take her so-special Mormon-insider humor into a more widely understood church-woman comedy. I can't help envisioning Ms. Mecham as a deeply disappointed wife of a Promise-Keeper! But until then, anyone who has experienced Mormonism's women should not miss, ""Special Living Lessons.""

3,PS2 PRO MINI WIRELESS 2-PACK,"Unfortunately I do not have a good review. I ordered these wireless for PS2 but one of them does not function correctly. I live in URuguay, Southamerica and ordered these to a friend that lives in Chicago, therefore I am not able to return them, but won't be ordering anything more anytime soon. I usually order books and decided to try the electronic department and really shouldn't have."
1,Poorly Made PS2 Controller,"When we received the controllers, the battery covers don't stay in tight so I had to tape them on. Also, one of the controllers joystick gets stuck. These are the most poorly controllers I've owned. We never had this with other PS2 remotes."
1,INTEC STINKS,"I just bought this hunk of plastic yesterday,and as soon as i bought it i hooked it up to my PS2 and 5 seconds later the dumb controller quit working. My Wavebird for my GCN never does that.INTEC STINKS"
4,One Broke And One Good,"I received the controllers for christmas they were great for about one week until I went to play with my friend, the one I had worked the one that he had did not work. The customer service from Intec was great they are sending me a new pair. So buy them if you want the ultimate gaming experience."
1,Total garbage!,The only reason they get 1 star is because you can't rate it any less. I give them a -4 star rating. These things are awful! I bought them for my kids for christmas and the next day they were back to using the Sony corded controllers. The signal would have to reset about every 5 minutes and totally ruins gameplay. I even e-mailed them about the problem with absolutey no reply. Tried to call them - was on hold forever. Steer clear of these controllers anything else from those scumbags at Intec!
1,For old PS2 only,"This was a good wireless controller for our four-year-old son -- a good fit for small hands -- until we replaced the aging PS2 with a new slim model. Suddenly, the wireless remote stopped working. It looks like this controller can only be used with the older ""big"" PS2? If that's the case, then your model of PS2 determines whether you should even consider buying this controller."
1,Doesn't work at all!!!!,"Tried to shut down wireless routers, cordless phones, still no use. You can't even get a stable connection at 2 ft, totally useless, I can get 4 ft with the Sony corded controller."
3,"Good Wireless Controllers, but the recievers don't work good, I had to send them back, and still waiting for my refund, but I di","Good Wireless Controllers, but the recievers don't work good, I had sent them back late Sept. 2005,and still waiting for my refund, but I did buy the same controllers at sams club and they work great!!"
5,"Princess Crunchy, Sweet, Pickled Carrots","The Princess Crunchy Pickled Carrots are a family favorite at my house. We serve these for parties and dinners and always get great compliments. The carrots specifically are almost candied they are so naturally sweet, and my nieces that hate everything will eat them by the jar.Princess carrots are natural, crunchy and pickled to perfection. You can keep them at work or at home for a healthy, sweet treat!"
2,"Bulky, unattractive",and the garter hooks showed through my slacks and skirt. The shorts also caused a major muffin top.
2,Disappointing purchase,"To tell you the truth I was disappointed with my purchase of a Flexees panty girdle.. I weigh 139 lbs. and assuming that imported goods tend to run smaller, as I find all the time.I ordered a size 2X, thinking that would be more than adequate. It was anything but. Much too tight and I couldn't get it all the way on. I am housebound and can't get out so have to depend on buying on-line."
2,you cant make a best of cd for the jerkyboys!!!,"if youve never heard the jerkyboys, maybe this is a good buy...but in all honesty, youre better off buying all of their previous albums because youll be missing out on some great ones...you simply cant fit all of their ""best"" pranks on one cd. for fans who already own every cd of theirs...this is a huge disappointment...dont buy it. 10 of the 12 unreleased ""tracks"" are not pranks, but just the characters talking (giving advice, etc). i bought it expecting 12 new pranks...i was extremely disappointed."
2,Not worth it,"I highly recommend you don't buy this CD.All this so called ""best of"" collection consists of is,a handfull of random picked calls from their first two albums on Select Records,two completly unfunny previously unreleased phone calls,and some of their characters giving some stupid advice about different things.This collection is not worth the time or the money.I recommend just buying all of the Jerky Boys' CDs seperate,and not even bothering with this."
5,Good Centronics Cable,"I needed this cable to go from a 4-1 (A-D) Centronics printer switch and my parallel printer that was long enough.This makes the grade, and allowed me to connect 4 computers to one dot matrix printer for invoices, emails, andtext documents that don't need ink jet quality. I save a bundle on printer ink this way because Epson ribbons areless than $10 each, and last for hundreds of documents."
4,Final FAntasy Music,"The music in this book is really good, and a must have for any final fantasy addict (or even just a casual fan)."
3,Uniqu9,"Not a bad movie. Not the greatest I have ever seen, but it was a good mystery. I think a little more detail at the end would have been nice, but other than that I give it a 3 out of five. I was impressed with the writing, the plot, and the ending. However I think if you didn't wait around until the end to tie it all together this might have proved to be a very confusing movie that left a lot of people not actually taking the time to finish it."
2,"Great cast, poor storyline!","Maybe I just couldn't get the jest of it all, but it was like a dream sequence back and forth. Left me scratching my head. Ryan Reynolds, Melissa McCarthy and Elle Channing added what little light I saw!"
2,Disappointing,"This is not a good or interesting movie. From the previews, I was hoping for a mystery to figure out. There is nothing to figure out. This movie is just random, odd things thrown together. As other reviewers stated, I nearly turned it off in the first ten minutes because it was so boring, but I thought surely it would get better. It did not. There really isn't much of a storyline at all. That being said, the acting is pretty good. Ryan Reynolds fans might want to watch this movie for that alone. I, however, wish I had my time back."
4,Keeps you guessing,"I must say that this was very much more of a sci-fi film than I expected, but different. It certainly kept me guessing till the very end. I enjoyed it; very well acted by the 3 main (and almost only) actors. I would recommend this to anyone with an open mind and who is looking for something different."
1,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this movie. I thought between Ryan Reynolds and Melissa McArthy that it couldn't miss, but it was very disorganized and hard to follow."
2,"""Look for the exit...""","Like most movies these days, this one starts with an interesting concept and then somewhere everything goes wrong. Rent this movie and then send me the 15 dollars you saved by not buying it. There is really nothing to this movie. There is no mystery or suspense. Everything is spelled out to you along the way in plain english. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the acting was good. Unfortunately that does not save this movie from disaster. You are welcome in advance."
1,DUMBER than Dumb,"Tried to watch it - kept thinking it had to get better as it went --- But, nopeTotal waste of time."
1,I figured it out,"About every nine minutes you'll ask yourself, ""Why am I wasting my time watching this bomb?"""
2,disliked this movie,"And the point is?The people in the movie seem to have completely lost it.Sometimes I think that may apply to our whole culture,but this kind of fluffy drugged outdream cloud of a moviejust isn't helping anyone think more clearlyabout our realities?Straight jackets all aroundand padded cells for the writer and producer.For a film like this the acting was pretty good."
1,sucked,"horrible movie the first part was sort of interesting the 2nd was very dull and i ended up fast forwarding through much of the 3rd, Ryan Reynolds is a good actor but this movie sucks badly avoid it."
2,Disappointed,"I rented this movie because I love Ryan Reynolds, but the movie was really disappointing. It was so complicated that I only watched it because of Ryan's good looks. I know it sounds superficial, but why do they have to make movies so damn complicated. I hated it."
4,Interesting and Surprising.,"I honestly would not have expected a movie of this caliber from Ryan Reynolds. Typically, he's a romantic comedy or action film kind of man. This was deep,it really made one step back to think. It brought into question what reality truly is in the same way that films like The Matrix and Inception did. While the Nines didn't quite reach The Matrix bar, it's definitely worth watching.As an audience, there were periods of confusion where you were utterly lost as to what was going on, but it wasn't for long and had enough intrigue to keep one hooked."
3,Stop Looking for 9's,"I think the game is an interesting concept, but the acting and story line left something to be desired. It was a rough and confusing story line that kept you wanting to just say no to 9."
2,Wasted Talent,"Well shot, well acted. I tried to get into it, but the longer it went on, the less everything made sense. Once they tied it up with a bow at the end, I was rolling my eyes. I don't understand why this is so highly rated at Amazon."
4,Great!,"I have two offices in two seperate locations and also work from home on occasion. I was given this by the tech department at my job and I love it. It is small, has lots of memory for text files and is plug and play compatible with my PCs at work and my MAC at home. It even comes with a cloth neck string so that I don't forget this anywhere (which I am very prone to do). The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the little plastic cover that covers the USB portion detaches from the flash drive and I know I am going to lose it soon. With something this small, it would be great if the cap attached to the drive. Other than that, great little thing."
1,English Propaganda,"Kee, a former RAF officer, lets his English propaganda brush slap on to the window pane. His examination of the Fenian Brotherhood of American is very shallow. He doesn't want to lose his American audience. He avoids tagging the former American officers as ""terrorists."" Yet one might ask oneself:why would an Irish born officer, founded at Fredericksburg return to Ireland --and not pick up his civilian life in America? A question not answered by Mr. Kee! Mr. Kee parleyed his trilogy into a multi-part BBC Tv series where is expressions and voice betrayed his lack of objectivity."
4,"Not a fan of the choroegraphy, but can't knock the idea","Bourne's swan lake is an interesting twist on the traditional version. The choreography (especially for the swans) is very modern. Theatrical choreography is used throughout the show, which does have many good moments...but I can't say that I'm an overall fan of Bourne's choreography in this show. His Nuctracker is simply amazing though! When I saw Swan Lake live, I had the same feelings about it as I do about the video, but the ""live"" aspect at least allowed me to watch what ever I wanted to watch in the seen, and just made things more exciting all the way around."
1,Unplayable Version shipped,"After seeing Bourne's NYC performance a number of years ago I knew I needed this DVD for my collection. I read the reviews and learned that the earlier version came with a fat booklet, which I wanted. The later version lacked that detail, reportedly. It was shipped promptly, but I was unable to find time to view it for maybe six weeks and by that time the shipping papers had been recycled. The version I was sent is intended to be played in ""Western Europe, Japan, and South Africa"". Not Maine, USA. I can play it on my laptop, but not my home theatre. My advice? Go ahead and order this, but don't wait to see if it is playable on your equipment. Try it right away. I shall order another version, but there's no way I can play this copy. I know it didn't come FROM Amazon, but it did come VIA Amazon."
4,AMAZING!,"this is a great production of Swan Lake! the reason that attracts your attention is the fact that the story line has been changed (from the classic myth of the swan and the prince), and the fact that the swans are male swans instead of the ladies in tutus' we've been used to! the second act (where the swans dance) is a unique choreography! i honestly must say that i'm facinated! the dancers move as gently as you would expect swans to move, yet rretaining their masculinity.. Adam Cooper, in th role of the male swan, is fantastic! the only problem is the story line, and maybe acts 1,3,4 aren't as good as act 2... but still it's more than worth it to own this tape! the second act is something no one should miss!"
5,A Must See Ballet that does away with the stuffiness,"Adventures In Motion Pictures have created a masterpiece of modern ballet. It's not boring classical ballet but a contemporary piece which is well executed by the company. It's true to say that the male swans may appear to give it a gay theme, but when you consider that the prince is falling in love with a swan, it's the love story that counts, not the sex of the swans. The finale is a masterpiece of heartstring tugging and will leave you clutching a kleenex and sobbing. Superbly directed and danced, this show has won many awards on stage and justly so. This film will not do the stage show justice, but is a taster for what you would see if you are lucky enough to get tickets. I say that you should BUY IT NOW!"
4,This movie was fabulous,Matthew Bourne's rendition of swan lake was wonderful. The movement of the swans was wonderfully birdlake yet still very graceful.
2,Only the music is Swan Lake,"The story, the settings, the dance are all new and 'creative'.The picture quality is excellent, sound quality is fair.The content is not my cup of tea."
5,Tchaikovsky-Swan Lake (Matthew Bourne),The DVD is the right one to help my daughter for her skating program.
2,I was disappointed to find this was not a ballet video,"This production is not for everyone, especially fans of traditional ballet and Tchaikovsky. While the overall production is of a very high caliber, I found occasional vocal interruptions by the cast during the performance (yowls of ""hurrah!"" for instance) to be especially disturbing. Do not purchase this video unless you are familiar with the contents. Definitely not appropriate for children!"
1,"Do you call this ""Swan Lake""?","When put the DVD into my player I found that I was deceived. This is a ""modern"" version, not the Swan Lake I want to buy."
1,Swan Lake (Matthew Bourne),"The music is wonderful, the sound quality on the surrond sound isgreat, but... The new ""modern"" version of this beautiful balletis just plain crud!If you like the music, buy it.If you like ballet, stay away!!!That funny whirring sound when you watch this is Tchaikovskyspinning in his grave!"
1,Mutton Lake,"A big dissappointment: I expected powerful male dancing as for example Jorge Don delivered in Maurice Bejar's choreography of a Swan solo in the 70's- but instead the male corp dances like Dude's neighbor in the ""Big Lebowski"". Thuddy hairy amateurs costumed in lamb skin. Riding pants hopping about doing hump backed arabesques. The Prince is a jazz dancer doing ballet steps.The women involved in the court scenes are real ballet soloists and the only honest dancing in the production. Without the strong hype and art-political support this production received on opening this ""Mutton Lake"" would have been dismissed out of hand as tacky twaddle."
4,Ridiculous Price,"I bought this soap a few months ago and was happy with it, it will not cure acne it just helps prevent it...every glycerin soap helps to prevent acne. I like the fact that it has dead sea minerals.However, $50 for a bar of soap is beyond outrageous. I bought this for $6 last time. You can find something with the same ingredients for FAR cheaper. $50...for soap...seriously."
5,Care for acne,This soap is a good for oily skin.It does remove oil and cure for your acne.I'll buy another one.
2,"Bad, but not bad enough","This product helped some of my acne, but actually made most of my my acne linger longer than if I were not to use it at all."
5,Awesome soap!!,"Finally something that has finally gotten rid of my acne. I was using benzoyl peroxide, just to have my acne get worse. I didn't want to continue to use harsh chemicals on my skin, so I gave this a try. I LOVE IT!! My skin is not dried out, and it has actually gotten rid of my acne in a very short period of time. I could see and feel results from the first use. I will definitely be buying more of this soap."
3,Helps with acne but makes face rather dry,"This soap helped with my acne problems but made my face very dry. Even after putting on moisturizer, I felt some tightness on my face, but at least it lessened the acne problems on my face."
2,Not enough information about Shelties,I bought the book looking for information about Shelties and it has very little info about Shelties and to much on raising and owning dogs in general. I have books on raising dogs. What I wanted was a book on Shelties and I did not get it. Futhermore I spent too much money on the book because I bought it in a pet store instead of from Amazon.com!
4,Not so bad but still not good.,"The second single of german pop-duo Modern Talking from the number 1 (in germany)the 11th album Victory contain 4 tracks and multimedia track. The main song ""Juliet"" written in the 70th style with none specific for the MT sounds. The remix is well made including some effects were very popular in the 70th like the car riding or the helicopter flying and a violin made this song similar to Boney M. The third track is ""Higher than heaven"" remix is not so differnt from the original album version remixed by Kai Nikold.The most interest is that single contain the track never released before - ""Down on my knees"", a typical Modern Talking song."
2,Poor Pentax Optio 60,"I have had this camera for 10 days and am very disappointed with the quality of photos it will take. Trouble with indoor pics being over exposed. Outdoors poor detail. Color quality not there. Had bought because it was small and price A waste of money!! Will be sending camera back tomorrow. I have 2 Olympus digital cameras Better indoor, better outdoor With Lots more detail They must have better lenses! Don't Buy!!"
2,Cheap but not cheerful,"I bought a Pentax Optio 60 largely on the reviews that the other Pentax models received in the camera press. Almost the entire Pentax range gets a full 5 star rating. The Pentax Optio 60 does have many good features, unfortunetly the auto-focus in normal indoor light conditions is NOT one of them. I just had a baby son and wanted to buy a camera that could take some good pictures of him. After a whole month I have just a handful of useable pictutes and many of those are not quite in focus. To make the camera focus I made a contrast sheet the the camera found easier to focus on, that was then placed by my son, I then auto focused the camera and had someone remove the contrast sheet. It worked but didn't make for spontaneous pictures. (...)"
2,Crappy Camera,"Poor focusing, long delay between clicking pictures, washed out images. I returned it and Amazon deducted $40 from the refund + freight each way. Bad experience."
1,This is terrible,"Let me start off by saying that this is my bosses camera, not mine. What I am about to tell you is what I learned in the 30 minutes I used it.Battery Life: DOA. The batteries are completely drained after the 30 minutes.Ease of Use: It took me about 20 minutes to find out how to change the options on the camera because the ""Menu"" button on the back has only 3 options (I tried to list the options; however, I don't know them & the camera is dead). To get the many different options, you have to turn the knob at the top of the camera to the screwdriver & wrench picture, which I assume stand for ""Settings"".Picture Quality: Horrendous. A lot of the pictures I took were not clear at all. When I looked at the previous pictures she took of a work event, 5 out of the 6 pictures were so fuzzy you couldn't see faces.Portability: It's portable.If my boss doesn't get a new camera soon, I will be getting her a new camera for Christmas."
1,WORST CAMERA OUT THERE!!!!!,Do not buy this camera. It is the worst camera I have ever had. It EATS batteries. It EATS re-chargeable batteries. We bought our daughter a $25 junk camera because we figured she would break it. That $25 camera is a much better camera than this thing. I sent it back to Pentax once. They sent it back and there wasn't any difference. I sent it back the second time and in a note I told them not to even bother sending it back. I wouldnt even GIVE this camera to a friend. Do yourself a favor and buy ANYTHING but a Pentax. I will never buy another product this company makes.
4,Pickett's Charge Explained,"Troy Harman, a longtime park ranger at Gettysburg National Military Park, has an intriguing thesis. He looks at the infamous Pickett's Charge, and wonders what the real objective of it was. Rather than simply charging toward the center of the Union line, the purpose of this charge was to occupy the high ground on Cemetery Hill.While I'm not 100% convinced by Ranger Harman's thesis, he does make a compelling argument that must be confronted by future histories of the battle.This is not the first book on the Battle of Gettysburg that I would recommend for a novice, but it is perfect for those who wish to study the battle in greater detail."
4,Graphics and Maps,Graphics and maps leave a lot to be desired when reading a kindle. The text itself was very informative and enlightening.
1,"Thin, very thin","Mr Harman's thesis that R E Lee's ""real plan"" is to simply capture a hill, rather than constantly seeking the best way to get at and defeat the enemy, certainly flies in the face of considerable evidence. So, what remarkable evidence does Mr Harman offer to back up his remarkable claim? Nothing. Instead, he bases his entire thesis on his interpretation of Gen Lee's ""the plan remained the same"" verbiage in his official report, and does so without any other evidence, or considering that Lee might be referring to something else when he wrote those words. Thin. Very thin, indeed."
1,Harmans real plan ar Gettysburg,"Harman's major point is that Lee could not be so dumb as to order Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg--but that a masterful plan of the Southern Genius General went awry. The book is short of documentation in the historic record of this and pads the book with discussions of Napoleans' strategy, Gettysburg Day 1 and Day 2, etc. Essentially it is a ""plausible"" idea bereft of evidence. The book imho is but a southern apologist's unbelief that Lee could lose at Gettysburg and that Meade on that day outgeneraled Lee."
2,Outdated,I didn't realize this book was last updated in 2002. Outdated. There isn't much coverage of Canada either.
3,RVing Alaska and Canada,This is a great read if you have ever traveled through Canada and Alaska. I have driven twice to Alaska and remembered much of it while reading (although I camped in a tent each night and never ate at a resturant). Her information on what she had visited and what other things you can do are informative and very useful if you ever plan to go.I just wish the photos were in color and maybe some small maps in each chapter to follow her journeys.
2,Not as good as he used to be!!,"I swore to never buy another W E B Griffin book, but I did, and I this will be the last. I have read every one of Mr. Griffin's books and the vast majority of them were great. Unfortunately the last few have been heavy on the description and unnecessary detail and very short on plot and action. The actual story in By Order of the Presdent could be provided in less than 20 pages. I don't mind that the formula is like all his books. The problem is there is not enough plot to fill 500 plus pages."
5,Excellent New Series,"Looks like another great new series. Setting this novel in the present day makes for greater imapct. Looks like Castillo could be his best character yet, as he is not a colossal screw-up like Matt Payne, Pick, or Lowell, more like Frade (speaking of which, can we have another Honor Bound book please Mr. Griffin).Yes, you do have to put reality out of place a little (especially towards the end), but overall a great read, and I can't wait for the next installment."
4,"Oh, dear God...","Web, I liked this one, if you're reading this, PLEASE finish one of your other series first. There are plenty of other people who can handle the Special Forces novels.I waited almost 15 years for the ""last"" Brotherhood of War novel. I've read and reread my copies of that until the things fell apart, not to mention the copies my squad leader in Korea never returned.You couldn't even finish WWII with the cast of the Corps, and instead skipped to Korea. For God's sake, does Charley Galloway marry Catherine, and what the hell does Weston do about his love life problems without having Pick Pickering kill him for nailing Martha?I've been waiting for a fifth in the OSS series for a few years now.We don't know if von Wachstein makes it back from Uruguay alive in the Blood and Honor series.Finish something else first!!!!"
4,A New WEB Griffin Character,"I have read all of Griffin's books and agree with another reviewer that we all want to see more novels in the Marine Corps and Badge of Honor series. Still, this is a new character and sounds like the first of a new series. Castillo could be the son of Cletus Frade or related to Ilse Lowell. Griffin has melded several of his themes in this new novel. The action is fast and the technology rings true. The FBI Academy bookstore has all the Badge of Honor series on sale. The New York Times published a supercilious review of this book by someone who has obviously never read another WEB Griffin novel. There are plenty of fans around for the other books and this will sell quickly. It is a combination of military and police work. The characters are all new but the skills are still there. Let's hope Butterworth (Griffin) keeps his health and keeps writing. he hasn't lost his talent."
1,Terrible Book,"I have read much of this authors work and this is not at the bottom of the barrel, it is UNDER the barrel. What a piece of junk. The story line is stupid, and the book jumps all over the place as if written by a high school kid wanting to be a big time writer.I just cannot believe he wrote this pathetic book."
1,Very Disappointing,Very disappointing. My first W.E.B. Griffin book and my last. Shallow on all accounts: character development and story line. 608 pages of mediocracy. Were his other books significantly better?
4,Wrong order,"I got the wrong book. I thought I had ordered The Outlaws and ended up receiving this book. I bought and read this book several years ago. The book is a good read, but I have no desire to read it again."
1,Not Good. At All.,"This is my first and last Griffin novel.I've enjoyed some Clancy in the past, and was hoping for similar fare here. Just something to read on the plane.What a mistake!Griffin spends almost 800 pages leading up to a two-page action sequence that reads like a phone book. Griffin simply states the facts. The reader never feels like he's ""there,"" in the action.Plus the characters are boring and one-dimensional.Let's see... Major Castillo is in Special Ops, the Secret Service, and a Special Assistant to the Director of Homeland Security... He speaks five languages... He's a combat vet who flies helicopters and jets... he's handsome, a lady killer... and everybody loves him.Get real.You know what, WEB Griffin?Characters are interesting only when they have flaws.BORING!!!"
2,Absolutely Horrible,"That's coming from a huge WEB fan. I've read every single one of his books and this is the only one I would rate as BAD. It is totally implossible and the dialogue is sappy. Borrow a copy, don't buy it."
2,Why I Did Not Have to Write a Scating Review,"I was all ready to write a really nasty review of W.E.B. Griffin's latest offering, By Order of the President, but Major Kevin Rice (see below) saved me the trouble.Griffin is, sadly, an over-the-hill flack who must have blackmailed his publishers into paying him by the word. Case in point the entire page taken up with meaningless dialog between the Lear's pilot and FAA ground controllers.And as far as the use of wierd phonetic alphabets go how about ""Papa-Zero-One-Zero-Three-Four"" for PZ-1034.My pet peeve with Griffin has always been that, as Major Kev mentioned, his lead characters all seem to be wealthy - some born to it (BOW's Craig Lowell) or others marry into it (The Corps Ken ""Killer"" McCoy).Just my additional two-cents."
4,Eager for the next book in this series,"Just finished By Order of the President and thoroughly enjoyed it. Not too much action, yet some very tense moments. I like the dialog, rivalry, and interplay between the different government agencies as depicted by Griffin. Already bought all the sequels."
4,WEBG STRIKES AGAIN!,I was deeply impressed by the book. An excellent plot and a final exciting sort out.
1,Tigered,"This book is not one of Griffin's best. Of those that I have read, it is by far the very worst. It drags on way too long, has too much ""John Wayne"" imagery in it, and some terrible grammar errors in the dialog. When Griffin finally gets to the time of ending the story it's as if he just got tired of writing and ends it. I hope this is not a sign of books to come from a highy recognized and usually entertaining author."
1,Not a very interesting read...,I read the first chapter of this book. It failed to hold my attention. I donated the book to the hospital I was staying in at the time. Stick with Tom Clancy books.
1,Wrong Book Order printed by Amazon,"Obviously Amazon is not very well set up. I ordered one book but another book was placed on the order form by Amazon. The wrong book. Not the book I ordered at all. I wish to have the book I ordered and I will not return the book I am receiving because I did not order that book, I will just the toss the wrong book. Amazon will not be getting any more business from me or my household. I would not even give Amazon one star. Well since I have to give a star before this will be sent. I give Amazon 1 star. That is the lowest rating I was able to give -5 stars would be more like it."
1,Disappointment,"""By Order of the President"" is one of the worst novels I have tried to read. I say ""tried,"" because, in two attempts, I have been unable to complete it. Long-time Griffin fans, of which I am one, will find many familiar features, such as the wealthy hero, the authentic military detail, the stalwart Pennsylvania Dutchman, and even the liberal doses of mangled German. One will search in vain, however, for a point to the story. It is long-winded, meandering, poorly-edited, and has only the barest trace of a plot, which is so absurd it hardly merits that designation. One can but wonder why this book was ever published."
2,Long and boring,"This is the first book I've read by Griffin and I wasn't impressed. The story is long and doesn't really go anywhere. He spends a lot of time on the main character's backstory, but it wasn't that interesting either."
1,What Happened?,"Where is the Griffin of old? I'm a great fan of his exciting, well written, concise Philadelphia police novels and some others, but this one is a real clunker. It is verbose to the point where 200 pages could be eliminated and still preserve the plot, such as it is.The story line is very confusing, and I don't see what Castillo's background adds to the story. Couldn't he just be an American and leave it at that?Also, Griffin's German is atrocious! Can't spell simple words and apparently is not aware that German nouns are capitalized."
1,Don't wast your time,Once you take away the constant wrong details in this book you are left with juvenile writing. The story itself feels like a B movie. Don't waste your time with this book.
2,I was a big fan of W. E. B. Griffin,I was a big fan of Griffin. While I kind of enjoyed the book I was very disappointed. I was hoping for something new what I found was a story that was pasted together from all his other books. This is kind of a Badge of Honor meets Honor bound meets etc.... He should write one more Badge of honor and for Gods sake let Matt live happily ever after instead of running off or killing his girlfriend. Also do the same thing for Lowel. I guess Griffin has run dry. It's a shame. This is my last Griffin book and I was a big fan. I read all his others to date. I guess authors have only so many books in them.
3,W.E.B. Griffin rides again,"Rather long-winded and slow to begin with, but picks up in the last half of the book. Average typical Griffin."
2,Nearly Got Bogged Down in Details,This is my first Griffin novel and I nearly didn't finish it. It was a slow read with a lot of useless detail and meandering. Griffin should stick to the story line and keep it moving. Pretty much forced myself to finish the book.
2,Meaningless details,"This is a short story masquerading as a novel. A plot is supposed to progress, but Griffin throws in too many impediments, such as flashbacks that contribute very little, if anything. Further, even present time in the story is dragged down by a plethora of inane details that do nothing to advance the plot. I finished reading the novel (skipping a few paragraphs here and there--but not enough), but it was maybe because I'm a bit of a masochist. And the characters were B-movie cardboard cutouts."
4,Simply Stunning,"These sphere's are absolutely perfect and look stunning in the window with our holiday decorations. I am going to be so sad when they have to come down, although I've read that some keep them up year round, which I would love to do! The wire and a string is provided from the top, so do be sure you have proper hooks or suction cups for this. I would've given these 5 stars, however, they are slightly overpriced, especially if you are going to buy more than one. After purchasing these here, I did find them on sale elsewhere for about $10 less, which would saved me a lot of money had I found them when I looked....I will say, that they were out of stock of the white/clear lights, which are, in my opinion, the prettiest color!"
2,NOT PURPLE!,"The star lit up great, very pretty. But definitely, absolutely NOT purple. When lit, its a very very bright pink. If you're okay with pink...then you'll love this spherical star. But my Xmas lights are white and purple and I was looking for something to match. This color stuck out like a sore thumb. So unfortunately, I had to return it."
5,Christmas light fan,We had purchased these lights before from a garden store & could not find them in our new location. Found them online at Amazon & ordered. Like the look at lot as they are different from other Christmas lighting on the market. Great shape & design.
5,Ten stars,"These are awesome! I bought several of them to decorate a tree I have in my front yard for Christmas time. They looked so good are VERY bright.The best thing about them is that they have a LONG cord (12' which is way longer than other lighted balls I've used), and they have an additional string to hang the balls from. (Some other lighted balls ONLY have the extension cord which makes hanging them troublesome.)I highly recommend these lighted balls!"
3,"I love them, but...","I love the way these Christmas balls look. I bought a few from Michael's in Dec 2011 and decided to add a few more for the holiday season. I don't know if these are the same brand I got last year.I bought 9 of these in red, green and clear. One of them was dead on arrival and a second ball failed less than 2 weeks later (half of the lights went out). When I was carefully taking them down after the holidays several of the plastic 'stars' fell off. A 20% + failure rate isn't acceptable. If I can find another brand next year I will swap out the broken ones with those."
5,This is a teriffic read!,"All my life I've wondered what it would be like to be a flat-chested Catholic high school girl with acne. Now, thanks to DC Stanfa's book, The Art Of Table Dancing, I know.This is a very funny, sometimes poignant memoir, every page of which sparkles with DC's wit (I thought at first it might be salt from my hard-boiled egg, but it turned out to be wit).Read this book - you won't regret it!"
2,not reliable,"spent over 1,000 dollars to replace compressor after 1 month beyond warranty expiration..........and then less than 6 months later died again"
1,Whisperkool a ripoff,Whisperkool products are poorly made and in a short period breakdown. The manufacturer does not support the product and will not even return calls. Stay away from this product. A waste of money.
1,This product is junk,"I had one of these for two years, then it failed. The company reluctantly replaced it, but the second one has now failed after another couple of years. The drainage system clogs with dust and is very hard to drain, although I figured out a way to do it. The thing is now constantly freezing up, and isn't able to cool the cellar room, despite the fact that the room is well insulated and within the stated limits of the device.Considering the price, an awful value."
1,buyer beware,I have owned 2 Whisperkool 4200 units for 15 years. They have both been replaced and or repaired numerous times. Refrigerators live longer than human beings without being repaired. Why can't a simple refrigerator unit last more than a year or two without breaking down like these units? I can only assume that these are poorly engineered.
3,Christmas Classics,This CD was disappointing. I wanted the nostalgia of Christmas when I was younger. It just didn't do it.
5,A lot of unique technical and historical detail,"This is a wonderful documentary that fills in a lot of holes left by other ""Moon Shot"" videos. I loved the detail regarding Lunar Orbit Rendevous. They do a great piece on the Marshall Space Center where the space capsules for Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo were designed. I really enjoyed the detail surrounding the work on the Saturn V, and the ""All Up Test"" that was needed to get the rocket program back on track. It was thrilling to relive the Apollo 11 landing from the eyes of the men in the control room, and their comments about the ""Tranqulity Base"" transmission. They did a very nice job on the Apollo 15/Dave Scott discovery of the Genesis Rock, and the story of Jack Schmitt, the only geologist astronaut in the program on Apollo 17. This was the perfect video to add to my space program collection."
3,Adequate,"This DVD is mostly useful to support the more documentary aspects of 'For All Mankind' and dramatic aspects of 'From the Earth to the Moon.'The narration is only adequate, the music awful, but it is still intersting to the buff. Watch both of the above first."
2,Adequate - but not inspired.,"This is a decent telling as a documentary with substandard music and production values but great research. It is telling that almost no special interviews for this DVD are provided by the Apollo 11 astronauts...the feuds rage on. Most of the other missions have interviews with the participants.From the Earth to the Moon and For All Mankind are far, far superior. This DVD confirms the accuracy of the research for From the Earth to the Moon, one the the most brilliant examples of television.The DVD also has no booklet or extras. The chapter list has no numbers, is on the disc (no printed list), and therefore worthless.This could have been great...and is mediocre."
3,Good Supporting Turns Save the Film,"The central premise of ""Save the Tiger"" about a clothing manufacturer at a crisis point in both his personal and professional life is intriguing enough. Alas, as executed here it falls short of the mark. John Avildsen's direction is flat, Steve Shagan's script seems more like dialogue than actual words people would say to each other and star Jack Lemmon, who won the Oscar for his work here, seems to be ACTING as opposed to getting into character. I give this film the pass for the superb supporting work of Jack Gilford as Lemmon's conscientious business partner, Thayer David as a professional arsonist, and Laurie Heineman as a free-spirited girl that Lemmon has a one-night stand with."
5,anatomy of a breakdown,"The late Jack Lemmon does excellent work here. Performance is powerful, moving.Recall sitting in a theatre on Hollywood Boulevard years ago and, as the film opened, had that gut feeling that I was in for something special. And guess what? It turned out to be--since Lemmon was awarded the Oscar for his memorable portrayal of a struggling L.A. garment factory owner doing his desperate best to keep afloat.Jack Gilford was absolutely topnotch as well.Glad Save the Tiger is on DVD."
3,Not enough descriptions about the characters,"Loretta Chase is an excellent writer. Being that I have never been to Egypt, I have no reference for understanding some parts of the story. The characters became somehow lost in the overwhelming details of their surroundings that I had difficulty piecing together. This story could have been told in several hundred more pages...perhaps that would have helped. I think that some editor realizing her talent convinced her to market her works in neat little 350 or so page dittys...When she could easily write a thousand page Gabaldon type novel and that would better tell her stories. We were short changed of a potentially marvelous experience."
2,Historical,"Daphne Pembroke's name may sound fluffy, but she's the brains of this book, in a time when women were thought to be flutter witted. When her brother is abducted by men who think he is the one with the brains to translate hieroglyphics, she needs more than her mind to rescue him, she needs muscle. That's where Rupert Carrington comes in after she bails him out of jail. Together, the winsom widow and the rogue set off to save her brother from thieves, but find adventure and romance getting in their way. However, what could have been a fascinating book seems rather bogged down with cumbersomely delivered details that only slow the pace rather than adding depth."
2,"Boring, boring, boring",First I think it's sad that the author took the same exact characters (personalities not description)from the movie Mummy crossed them with the adventures of Sinbad and then tried to pass them off as her own. There is absolutely *no* chemistry between the hero and heroine. I just found the whole experience boring.
4,Delightful regency with overtones of Christie and Peters,"This was a delightful book and, although set in the Regency period, reminded me of some Agatha Christie mysteries set in the Middle East [in part because her husband was an archeologist and she spent time at his digs] and of the mysteries of Elizabeth Peters [with a similarly intrepid heroine]. Both of these writers placed their characters in more modern times but the depiction of the English among the Arabs is similar, as are the mysterious happenings and comic relief.Well worth reading."
4,I would have given it five stars but....,"Daphne's character kept me from doing this. Maybe it was because she was SO smart and she had past experience from marrying Pembroke - she knew what type of man NOT to have a relationship with- but I felt she should have seen through Rupert and sorted out her feelings before she did. I LOVED Rupert's humor and how he handled his relationships with the secondary characters including the mongoose. Still, I was happy to see Daphne and Rupert together at the end.*** A light read with some silliness that made it good.***"
5,A terrific read!,"This was my first Loretta Chase novel but it certainly won't be my last. I loved this book. It was fun and exciting and romantic. Ms. Chase provided enough description of the surroundings without becoming ponderous. The main characters were well-drawn and very likable. The dialogue was sharp and witty, something lacking in most historical romances. I laughed out loud quite a few times during the course of the story. Needless to say I will be purchasing Ms. Chase's backlist. Mr. Impossible is a definite keeper."
5,ANOTHER KEEPER!!,"If it is a book by Loretta Chase then you can bet it's a keeper. I was so happy to find her second book about the Carsington family. Thank goodness it's a large family! To make it even better, Ms. Chase actually has the story take place in Egypt. So many authors start a book in Egypt but by the second chapter ther're back in England. Why? You would think they would know their characters could get into more exciting and dangerous adventures in Egypt. Maybe that's what separates Ms. Chase from the writing herd. She's smart and knows her subject. This is a funny, sexy, can't put it down book. I'm not going to go into the plot since that's been done in other reviews, but if you like smart characters and adventure, this one's for you. If you need something to read until Ms. Chase writes her next book, try Leslie LaFoy's trilogy. Excellent, too."
3,Missing something,"I own everything Chase has ever written. Her characters are usually drawn so incredibly well. For some reason this book seems to be missing something. Maybe because I needed to know more about the hero. His short introduction just wasn't enough. I would have liked to hear more about what he was thinking, what were his motivations (besides sex witht heroine). The heroine was smart, funny and commited to rescuing her brother. She was also missing something. When I put the book down I wasn't satisfied. It was like eating a fish dinner and being hungry two hours later. The Egyptian locations were interesting, but I really wanted to hear more about the older brother."
5,Meant to be together,"Summary: Book is set in Egypt. The Heroine is a scholarly young widow with lots of cash and emotional baggage. She carries it handsomely and reigns in her passion but then her brother is kidnapped. This spurs her to cast her widow veils and set out on an adventure to find him. To increase her chance of success she buys the 4th son of an earl from prison to be her guide and ""brawn"". He is indeed impossible! A discussion with him would leave you smacking your head against the wall. Despite this or rather because of this, he makes for a dashing hero.To me, romance isn't about the perfect woman meets the perfect man. It is about two personalities that meld so well that you know they are meant to be one. This is the feeling I got in this book. The h/h are certainly fleshed out into real people, with real personalities; and by God did I LOVE their quirks! Unique, hilarious and leaves you (the reader) with the warm afterglow of witnessing true love. MUST READ."
5,Brilliant live Madama Butterfly,"This is one of my all time favourite Butterflies. Renata Scotto offers an almost perfect Cio Cio San and her partner, José Carreras, gives one of the best performances in his brilliant career. Listen to this gorgeous, glowing voice... His phrasing puts all young tenors of today to shame... If you're looking for the perfect live-recording of Madama Butterfly THIS is it!!!!!"
