2,Disappointing and muddled,"This was the strangest story. I really enjoyed ""Out Stealing Horses"" and was very disappointed in this. There was no character development and you never understood why anyone acted the way they did. The story jumped around so much that it was hard to keep up with."
2,"jams printer, great texture","It's beautiful paper. I don't care how much, so it was a good buy for me.But, the texture and thickness were too much for my Epson printer. It was constantly jaming and took too much time to get a finished page. I won't use it but only because Epson Work Force won't print it other than one page at a time, while you then have to adjust the paper supply for one more page.It's not bad paper, only bad Epson printer too cheap, don't buy cheap."
4,Love this stuff!!!,"This has become a favorite snack for both my kids and myself. We also love to put it on top of our vegetable soup with noodles and it's SO tasty. I don't actually need it included in or on anything. It's so good just by itself. It arrived in a timely fashion and I felt the quality was great. My only concern is the price. I don't see how this is something that I'll ""snack"" on daily since it is a little costly. Other than that, it's a good product with good flavor and many health benefits."
2,old and must have expired,"Delivery was in good time but the product was old, the oil is old and did not taste good. There was no expiration date on it."
1,see-through thin,"don't know how reviewers or the company calls these ""snaks""; they're thinner than tracing paper, than tissue paper; possibly to roll very carefully around rice or who knows what- if they would hold together; but a snack? tiny green not very flavorful pieces of incredibly thin seaweed looking cellophane"
3,Tastes Great COST HIGH for so little,"As the title states, they have doen a wonderful job of making this seaweed taste wonderful. It is not too salty and flavored just right. I was surprised at how little comes for this price. I understood that it would be snack packs, but I expected there to be larger volume for this price."
4,not yelwolfs new stuff but worth checking out,"i really like a few songs on here they are bumpin, its got sum older style beats but it is worth checking out, if you want sum hard hitting good stuff get arena ep, and trunk musik-- if you dont got them yet get them right now incredible cds"
4,Language and power,"A man can be an idiot in as many languages he can speak. But polyglot Langton is no idiot - just unlucky to get caught between several mighty antagonists, striving to save a country and make a huge profit as well. The stake is the contract to supply large areas of Russia with essentials. Of course, Langton the interpreter and chair of the conference stands deep in the mud, and of course the situation does not get any easier for his affair with the beautiful, but elusive expert Martha. The picture of men representing different kinds of power - financial, political and the Japanese Mafia - is believable and chilling. One feels the strain on Langton when he muddles through as well as he can, playing chess on an unstable board and waiting for the earthquake. Another thriller - quite Western, and charming in its exploration of Japanese culture and the mystery of languages. Worth reading for that - and the plot is not bad, either."
5,Sarah Taylor's Voice is HOT!,If you are looking for a sexy Christmas song that will turn heads and bring a few laughs at your next party -- this is the song (Presents for Santa) to add to your collection. Sarah Taylor's voice is sooooo seductive and yet the lyrics are soooo funny too. Does anyone know if Sarah Taylor has recorded anything else???
5,Fantastic book,You will rank this book as one the best you ever read. Clearly written and great facts..don't pass this one up.
3,Flower box planter-,"I just got three of these for Christmas and they look nice but the walls are very thin. I'm afraid once it's loaded with dirt and flowers it will sag outward, plus the picture shows it with two brackets but only one came with each of mine. A 36 in planter needs more support than that. Also, in case anyone else thinks these straddle your rail, they do not. They are on brackets you have to mount. I am going to get more brackets for mine before I try to mount them because there is no way one will hold it."
4,aquadrops,"hard item to find in drugstores now, i guess because it hasn't really been found to be hydrating. works for me tho."
3,"Tracks accurately, but not smoothly","This drive uses a stepper motor that clicks a few times per second to move at the sidereal rate. I could hear its clicking amplified in my 4.5"" reflector's OTA. I tried imaging Saturn at 150X magnification and in my captured AVI you can see it darting back and forth.This drive may be useful for wide-angle piggyback astrophotography, but it's not worthwhile for through-the-scope imaging."
3,Heave a ho there sailor!,"This now-forgotten ""Dennis the Menace"" sibbling tried to be for the Navy what Beetle Bailey was for the Army -its pet comic strip. In the end it didn't succeed because its humor was rather lame and its characters quite boring. On top of it all, it came out when Women's Lib was at an all-time high, and I suspect the strip's somewhat outdated sexist outline (a tiny Don Juan with a girl in every port) didn't fit well with the times. However, it's still worth a look for its beautiful artwork -perhaps Ketcham's best, which is to say a lot! Each panel is a masterclass of comic strip composition, lighting and storytelling, and both the ships and the girls look stunning. Its Sunday color pages were nothing short of spectacular. Unfortunately, this pocket book only contains the three panel, B&W gags. I hope someday Fantagraphics, which is now publishing the complete Dennis the Menace works, will give Half Hitch its due."
4,A good chance to hear what you missed,"If you're like me, the first album is filled with familiar tunes, Poor Poor Pitiful Me, Werewolves of London etc, while the second album contains many songs you haven't heard before. Who but Zevon could have written Monkey Wash Donkey Rinse?Those of you who, like me, overlooked Warren Zevon's later career owe it to yourselves to hear this set."
5,A must for every Zevon fan,I'll Sleep When I'm Dead is a must for every Zevon fan.what more can I say.
1,70's dross,Bad Springsteeny songs backed by a drunk Rolling Stones. Sorry folks this music has not ripened with age. Don't say you weren't warned.
5,Perfect as an introduction to Buddhism,"This was the first book on Buddhism I ever read. Since then I've read many more as a result of this book. I found that because it tells the story of a Westerner who becomes ordained a lot of my scepticism was mirrored in the initial stages of Richard Randall's experience. If you're curious about Buddhism this book will both quell the western sceptic in you, as well as give you a very down to earth account of what it means to walk the path. Personally it led me to want to learn what is meditation, what is mind, what is the self? Still looking for answers, but I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels drawn to Buddhism but isn't quite sure what it is."
2,Sad attempt,"This is Bella Morte's sad attempt at fame and fortune. The previous albums are much more complex, with meaning behind the music. Andy Deane just plods along with random shots in the dark in his quest for that elusive break. There are some catchy songs and the boys did in fact listen to the fans and release Earth Angel. It's a keeper if you want to complete your collection but it's the wrong direction for the Bella Boys."
2,Badger SPF 15 Sunblock Lip Balm,"Sorry, I really wanted to like this stuff, but it's to white & chalky. It would be good if I were just going to lay in the sun at the beach, but I use it to play golf & the guys are asking whay's going on with my lips. For the beach I would have rated it higher. It goes on smooth and it does stay on."
3,Turns your lips white,My only complaint about this chapstick is that it turns your lips white. I am not able to wear it out everyday as I expected I would.
1,White lips,This is definately not a lip balm for those who dont wear makeup because it leave you lips white.If you wear a lipstick over(lightens the color depending on how much you apply)or if you hardly use it then it might work.One that I found much better is Hurraw sun balm it is really translucent and contains zinc oxide for protection. Love badger lip balm but unfortunatly this is a fail.
1,White Lips,"This lip sunscreen leaves an ugly white film on your lips that is very noticeable and feels sticky. My husband said I looked like a crackhead. I like Badger sunscreen for the body and I like their bug repellent stick as well, but this is no good."
3,Give joy to my youth: A memoir of Dr.Tom Dooley,"Those who have enjoyed Dr. Dooley's books, like to know a little more about his life"
4,Hen da yo!,"Two samurai lovers (Tomoya Nagase and Shichinosuke Nakamura) head for the Ise Shrine so that one of them may be cured of his heroin addiction. This bizarre film is so surreal that it nearly defies description, leaping through various time periods at will and presenting a phantasmagoric gallery of imaginative oddities. The only constants running throughout the film are the devotion of the two lovers and the harrowing depiction of the hell of addiction. This is definitely not a film for everyone, but I was consistently entertained by the confident brazenness of writer/director Kankuro Kudo and his talented cast. There are episodes of head-scratching weirdness, laugh out loud moments, and even some sequences that are oddly moving. I was particularly impressed by Itsuji Itao as the sad comedian Naniwa Hotto (whose entire schtick appears to consist of proclaiming things to be ""hot"") and Yumi Shimizu as the worst singer in the world."
3,"His Name is MAHONEY, not MCINTYRE!","This was a pleasant enough production but what was the point of a ""new"" English translation? There already is a fine English version of this opera, as performed by NY's Metropolitan Opera. This translation is just foolish. The definition of Mahagonny, meaning City of Nets, is changed to City of Webs. OK, but the lead male character is named Jimmy Mahoney and this version calls him Jimmy McIntyre! That's like coming out with a new translation of ""Carmen"" and deciding the character is now named ""Matilda."""
5,good,"my theology teacher loves this book and i will get good use out of it, good condtion and got here on time"
5,The O'Toole at his best,"A fascinating, captivating look inside the mind of one of the greatest actors of our time. Hard to put down."
4,Good work,"I enjoy watching the original 'Twilight Zone' and when I saw this book which was edited by Carol Serling, I wanted to see if she had the sense of what makes a good TZ story as her late husband did. Overall, I believe she did a good job. Many of the stories contained in this book are enjoyable and often contain the ""twist"" endings needed in the TZ tradition. I would recommend this book to any Twilight Zone fan who enjoys stories that take us to that other dimension of fantasy. It beats watching the new Twilight Zone anytime."
5,What's with the 1 stars!?!?!?!?!?!?,"I can't seem to understand all the one star reviws but it sounds like they were all written by the same person to me. I found this album to be amazing and stayed up til 2 a.m. listening to it three times in a row!!! I don't know what CD the reviewers are listening to but there is certainly the same depth, melodies, rock and exploration as on past CDs. Bands change, people!!! Live with it! These are the songs of talented musicians who love what they do. Ignore the negative reviews and pick this one up. I guarantee you'll be hooked!!!"
1,Dissapointing!,"The songs are boring, the lyrics are plain. I am so dissapointed. I bought it without listening to it first thinking I would at least find one song. How wrong was I to find out that not even one track speaks to me. Andrea's solo album sucked. Now this! I think their creative days are over and if I see them in concert again, I hope I am not tortured with the music from this new album. Instead I hope they play the oldies but goodies that characterize them as the band I love so much"
2,Almost unusable,"When I first hooked up the motor and turned it on, I was surprised to see Saturn reverse course and head east. I had to tweak the speed control to try and match the sidereal rate. This wouldn't be bad if you only had to do it once, but it slows down as the battery wears out (which will happen MUCH faster than the 35 hours advertised). So you'll find yourself tweaking the speed control often.The worst part about this motor is that it makes fine manual R.A. control impossible. There's no ""clutch""--you can't rotate the R.A. worm gear shaft without disconnecting the motor first. But you can't reconnect the motor without first rotating the worm gear shaft so that its groove lines up with the thumbscrew on the drive shaft. So the only way to adjust right ascension with the motor attached is to loosen the R.A. lock nut and slew the telescope manually, which can be difficult at high magnifications."
3,WORKS GREAT.....BUT BREAKS,THIS IS A GOOD SCOOP...BUT BEING PLASTIC....IT WON'T LAST TOO LONG.....BUY ACOUPLE IF YOU GO THIS ROUTE....OR LOOK FURTHER FOR LONG TERM USE AND DEPENDABILITY.
4,"few graphs, many examples","Another in Dover's series of reissues of long out of print books. Here we get Byerly's masterful text on Fourier analysis. A century old. But the notation is essentially still used today. The font is old fashioned. Since partly to save costs, Dover did a photoreproduction of the original text, instead of resetting the text.Another thing to note is that there are very few graphs, as compared to a modern book. Typical of texts of its time. But numerous examples are worked out, and you can profitably go through these."
4,First treatise of math problem,It' s important text to start study theory of thermal flow in one or two dimension. We can find a ease application of ellipsoidal harmonics and we have many examples that help the student to understand the math problem.
4,Ehh,"The storyline was difficult to follow. This is because the dialect/dialogue was difficult to understand/comprhend what the characters were saying, and subsequently, what was going on.Other than that, great RPG action and cutomability. Huge worlds to explore, monsters to vaquish. Great strategy."
5,Very Good,"Very fun. Even though Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2 where both good, Final Fantasy XII is more like a regular Final Fantasy game."
3,Not Quite Up To Par,"I have been a fan of the Final Fantasy series for many years, so when I learned about FF12 I knew I had to try it out. I bought it and played it all the way through. Maybe it's because I had such high expectations ( it IS a Final Fantasy afterall), but I was very dissapointed with this latest installment. The battle system was different, and I actually didn't have a problem with that, but the characters just felt so BLAND. The main story itself seemed rushed, it could have been a lot better. I didn't even know I was at the end of the game until I saw the credits. The only part of this game I can say I genuinely liked was the side quests. There seems to be more side quest than actual game. Overall it's still a fun game, but as far as Final Fantasy's go, it's not quite up to par."
4,a better game,much better than the earlier versions of final fantasy. better combat but still more about management than fighting. visually more of a treat. all in all a very good game.
4,My Daughter Loves it ........ Pretty Fun !!!!,"I bought this for her for a Gift.She always has liked the Final Fantasy Series.Graffics are Very Good, and Good Story line.How many more of these are they going to make ?? LOLMaybe they can start a New series related to this.The Game is Fun and I think you will enjoy it !!!"
3,So So FF Entry,This Franchise has had the best and worst RPG's I've played. Final Fantasy XII made the worst idea by making a game that allowed you to search for hours for a weapon that you may or might not receive because of the stupid percentages. A lot of the game was entertaining though.
2,very awosome qquickly delivery,"very awosome qquickly delivery, and clean and good cd i wnat to buy another thank you perpect i want to play now"
3,Average RPG,"Yes, that's right... This is an Average RPG. IT's enjoyable to anyone who likes RPG game style. Leveling, skills, magic, gold, unique items. Besides that it goes down hill from there. I won't comment on new battle system that is irrelevant.The game's characters are dull, and unimignitive. Probably the worst set of Characters in Final Fantasy History. When you can't tell if a character is a guy or a girl, or a prepubescent boy, you're in trouble.The story line is not any better either. Compared to FFX and FFVII this story line is a joke.If you're looking for an RPG world to run around in and level, kill monsters, and progress through a boring plot line with characters you soon forget.. this is the game for you."
3,FF XII Review,"The game is very well made and I see that other people really enjoyed it. However I didn't like it because I was used to Final Fantasy games such as FF7, FF8, and FF9; all which use some sort of turn-based battle system. FFXII (12) uses real-time and it sort of dissapointed me."
5,it's final fantasy,"this game doesn't need a review, anyone who has played a final fantasy game knows that are of the best rpg's ever made"
3,"Plot lacks simple structure, bosses were fun","The only fun part of the game was the bosses which there were a good number of. Grinding through the regular monsters was okay too, to test out your different weapons. I do like the way the skills and equipment licenses are set up. It gives your team a lot of room for diversity. The only problem was that the plot seemed so intertwined and mushed up that I didn't really know what was going on half the time. At first the plot is pretty simple but then when it starts to develop it just gets really confusing. A simple good plot would have been something like FF7. I recommend this game to any die hard final fantasy fans but not to the casuals."
4,Complete transformation of the franchise,"I wish to say categorically that I enjoyed playing this game, it was lots of fun. At the same time, there was a lot that had this game not feel like the Final Fantasy I grew up with. The fact that you've got live-action battles rather than the turn based battles of Final Fantasy games past, as well as the looser plot structure than the plot curve which has been there since FFIV.This is a great game, but I think we're seeing a completely new franchise now. The last FF game in the classic model was FFX, and here we're seeing something completely different. What will we see next in FFXIII? We'll have to wait and see(and I'll have to hear about it secondhand, since I have no intention of shelling out dough on a PS3. ;-) )Suffice it to say, buy it, enjoy it, love it. Just don't expect your older brother's Final Fantasy, because you won't get it."
3,"Great battle system, the worst maps ever!!!","The battle system is great, graphics is the best I've seen on PS2, good story but why did they have to make maps that are the most annoying ever on any FF game?! I've always hated RPGs with stupid mazes and useless maps where you have to try to survive for at least 5 hours before you can find a save point!!! Sure these crazy dungeons are optional but what the heck is the point of making them so hard to navigate, then finding out later you cannot battle that stupid thing sleeping in there because you have to beat something else first. Don't tell me about walkthroughs...if I wanted to read a book I wouldn't have purchased this game and bought that walkthrough instead. Of all the FF games I've played, this is the only one which has succesfully made me doze off while holding my controller."
2,It is a different Final Fantasy!,"In this edition of Final Fantasy things are way different. Personally, I think that changing the original battle system with out the classic victory music is wrong. Also the storyline is very confusing for anyone unless you take notes in the beggining (yeah right). I also did not like how you have to pay for a license to equip something. I have not finished the game quite yet but I hope that things change A.S.A.P. The game's graphics are incredible but the characters and their interactions are boring. Oh and the map of the towns are just way too confusing!"
1,Complete Crap,"This game takes away everything a true FF title is.It has a real MMO feel to it, and if it wasn't for the title, you'd NEVER know you were playing ""Final Fantasy""If you're buying this because you're an FF addict, don't bother..but, if you're just looking for a decent RPG with an MMO feel, go ahead and pick it up.Conclusion - It's decent, but gives real Final Fantasy titles a bad name."
2,Boring!,Compared to others in the series this game is terrible. It starts off great but gets boring really quick. Gambits make this game almost 100% automated. Don't waste your time with FF13 either. A great series is quickly heading downhill.
2,blah,"I have played ff7, ff8, ff10, ff10-2 and ff12 in completion first off. The game starts with great story and graphic and an interesting new game play. But you soon find there is no love story and after about half way no new developments in plot. It is like they made half a game and hoped people wouldn't realize they forgot to finish it. As bad as ff10-2 was this might be worse."
5,Final Fantasy 12 Review,"This is only the third final fantasy game I've ever played. It's also one of the best! It took some time to get used to the new control system, but I love the near limitless customization of each character. The graphics are fantastic, they really push what the PS2 is capable of. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone."
1,This was awful.,I hated this game. I grew up watching my older brother playing final fantasy games and I loved watching it. I finally got a ps2 and started playing them for myself and loved them. This one I got for christmas last year and .... well... it's a year later and I still can't stand to play it. I hate the fighting style. I didn't CARE about any of the characters and didn't really get intrigued by the story line. I gave it 5 hours before switching to Mortal Kombat just so that I could have a character I could REALLY control. This game sent me looking for my old sega! My roomate tried made it about 16 hours into the game before giving up. I couldn't even watch him play it I was so bored.The graphics were great. That's the only good thing this game has to offer.
4,How Tragic...,"This game is probably the best in terms of graphics and storyline, but some of the other features (such as the battle system) leave much to be desired. In fact, the battle system is probably the most BORING part of the game. It reminds me of the original Dot Hack game series' battle system...which is just as boring. The bad thing about this game though is that you'll be fighting most of the time due to the game's new system for obtaining money (along w/ new items, equipment, etc. of course) AND because of this game's achievement system... which is a tragedy considering that it's a Final Fantasy game."
3,Too easy,"This game was based upon ""gambits"", which are automatic reactions by the characters. At first this made it more interesting, but then it became too easy when all you have to do is let your characters fight without your guidance. The only worthy character had to be Balthier, the rest are boring and without good backstories (they all seem rather thrown together, with no purpose for fighting together). Waste of time."
3,"not the best final fantasy, but it's interesting",the storyline isn't exciting. you spend more time on side missions than the actual story. it's hard to keep track of the story because of how often you side track. i've never actually fallen asleep while playing a game until FFXII. it's a very easy game.
2,Final Fantasy XII is great but.......,Final Fantasy XII is a pretty good game. The graphics are not as good as in Final Fantasy X or X-2. The story plotline is easy to understand but it's so adult like. The battle system is kind of hard but a lot of fun. It takes forever to level up in this game. The overall hardness in the game is 3 out 5 stars for me anyway. That is not why I rated the game 2 stars though. The reason the fun is 3 stars and the overall game is 2 stars is because the graphics are not as good as X or X-2. The gameplay gets pretty boring after a while. And that the story is so boring. The plus sides of the game is that at least the story is easy to understad. The overall gameplay is good(exept for the battle system). And that all the cool abilitis you can get. That is basicely it
1,The Worst Final Fantasy yet,"Do not buy this game.i got it for christmas.i have always been a fan of final fantasy. especially the unique gameplay.in this game, when you phight, you move around, and can only attack enemies NEAR YOU! and it takes like 30 seconds to attack!and the citites are so BIG! and there are barely any save points! you have to play for like and hour before saving once!at least i gave this game some what of a chance. weak plot too. frustrating when you equip magic and weapons.if you like classic final fantasy gameplay i recomend:[...]"
3,Alright game,"The Game it self was in new condition like promissed. I bought it for my husband for Christmas, and he says it is an alright game. I bought it, because that is the one he asked for. The game is what Amazon promised!:)"
4,"Panoramically huge game, in the finest tradition of the series.","This game was written to the absolute technical limits of PS2. It is enormous, fun, and a decent walkthrough runs over 300 pages. It gives hundreds of hours of enjoyment, and it has Sky Pirates!"
2,To The Point,"Battle system is fluid and engaging (similar to FFXI), and the overall looks of the game are spectacular. However, anyone who says this game's storyline has depth, has never progressed past a third grade reading level (or played FF VII or VIII). Character development is nonexistent, so you gain no attachment to them through understanding, nor do you have any vested interest in finding out what happens to them. There are no personal relationships developed between ANY characters, and the plot itself is so one-dimensional that I found the thing, despite its great looks, a complete bore. I almost didn't finish it. There's no sense of climax and the characters are 100% static. They never change.What could be worse? Well, the game is also ridiculously easy. And I mean ridiculous. The end fights in VII and VIII, those were pretty tough, even WITH the best weapons. The end fight in XII, just select fight, and then heal occasionally and you'll be fine."
2,I'm not a fan of this change,"Square-Enix is very adventurous with its flagship franchise, but I just couldn't get into this one. The story seemed a bit overly-political and I didn't really like any of the characters. The battle system is convoluted and boils down to letting everyone do what they wish on auto-pilot or proceeding through a battle moment-by-moment micromanaging every movement. I really tried to get into this game, but no dice."
2,Disappointing,"Cons: Flat characters, boring story, boring battle mechanics (I have played several MMORPGs these mechanics do NOT mimic those of an MMORPG.)Pros: Open world, All skills/abilities/equipment available for all characters"
2,Boring and dissapointing.,"I'll go against the majority and say that this is my least favorite Final Fantasy. First, the storyline is boring, the characters are not pursuing a major antagonist and don't have a clear goal. They travel from place-to-place with their goals constantly changing. This seems to result in repetitivness and makes the story plain boring. The characters for the most part seem extremely shallow, they are very simple and predictable and there seems to be nothing new to learn about them. Balthier and Fran, 2 characters in the party are a little more interesting but their stories are not well explored. The gameplay is reptitive, the license bored system becomes frustrating after a while. In order to learn new abilities you're required to get more and more license points yet defeating monsters still gives you 1 or 2 points even as the game goes on. Its hard to describe, but the game simply lacks substance."
4,Pretty unique as a FF game,"I have played this game for about 30 hours and it is pretty addictive and fun. I have played almost all other final fantasies, and this most reminds me of FF3. The new battle system makes it MUCH less boring when you are around and fighting ""everyday"" creatures (e.g. for leveling up). The story can use some work though, it seems like they are riding the Lord of the Rings fantasy wave (but with guns) and making the character speak in english accents with gigantic words. I am not a particular fan of the story, but maybe you will be. This game seems to have a ridiculous amount of hours of gameplay if you really want to do everything meticulously (more so than any other final fantasy)."
5,Gaming,This is a great game and everyone loves playing it.Gave as a gift. I will probably buy more games of tthis type
5,ff12,Game is great. I bought used one for 5 bucks and it works perfectly fine. Hours of fun and if you like final fantasy you would definitely like this one.
4,GREAT GAME!!!!,"Of the FF12 games, I would have to say that Final fantasy XII is one of the best out there. considering the game is for the playstation 2. that would be the only down side i could see. get this game if your tried of FF13 or just want to finish the final fantasy series"
2,Worst in series,"Except for the gambit system which is the best thing about the game this one's a dud folks. Graphics are dull and blurry even though its true 3D, FF X2 looks much better. I can't say much for the story which comes of dull and depressing that complements the awful textures you see in the game. The level up system is a joke. Everyone has the same skill trees so you end up with a group of communists that can do it all. Then you have the hunts. You trudge virtual miles to get a weak reward. I can think of any FF game going back to the snes thats better than this overhyped junk."
3,It's an Adventure Game with a FF Label,"Game was okay. I didn't mind the fighting system, the series needed a change in that regard. I have been out of the loop with systems for the last decade so I bought me a PS2 just to play some good old JRPG's. Whatever was lacking in the story or characters was not important to me, I just wanted a game with a real FF feel. I can see where the series began to lose itself and became just a glorified adventure game/dungeon crawler in XIII. I always liked having a huge world map to move around in and explore. Not this type of game where you're inside the whole time and follow lines on a map to the next part of the story. JRPG's may tend to be linear but you're at least given the illusion of exploration."
5,good customer service,"bought it used in like new condition, first one didnt work but got a working replacement no questions asked in the same week.as for the game itself it's hate it or love it for ff vets with the new style of battle where it's still turn based in a way but you still run around theres no more random pop up battles. the mainstory is average ff length but completing all the extra side quests takes a considerably longer time to complete than in the past. the toughest side boss in this game is the hardest ive ever seen literally taking a week to defeat you just fight him for awhile leave save and then go back and continue the fight so if you like to do all that side stuff make sure you dont mind a hefty time investment"
4,great but not awesome,"This game was a lot of fun and worth the hours to beat it for the first time. however, I would not put my effort into beating it twice because it just wasn't that interesting to do so. Of course, I've only been willing to beat certain games twice (less than 10 in my lifetime), so that doesn't say much.Buy it. Play it. Enjoy it. Then sell it back to GameStop!"
1,Not the best game,"I liked the battle system and collecting weapons until i was looking for droppable weapons which takes ages to accomplish.Besides that this game was fail i think, but i understand some people like it.I think its one of the worst games in the series. Music was pretty horrible most of the time and the character depth was none, and so few cut-scenes.Seems like Square is doing all those games that are so focused on graphics and battle mode. What i like most about FF is the characters, music and storyline and this game failed in all of them, i think.There was definetly fun parts to this game, but there wasnt exension to it, you found cool places and some things happened and then all of a sudden it was all over and you had 400 hours left only to fight."
2,My Disappointment,I played final fantasy X and found it to be the best game I ever played but this game came very short of expectations. Final Fantasy X had an excellent story and X-2 was fun although not strong material.In this game you might as well take time to do the side games. Going through the game you long deseperately for the twist that never happens. It is like a book that goes on and on where the ending disappoints a lot. The character Vaan is one useless main character who works like a side one. The point of Final Fantasy is the story and gameplay. The story is pointless.The gameplay is better than X though. The live fighting mode gets rid of the most annoying part of X and all Final Fantasy Games. The Weapon system is good although I didn't like the license thing better than sphere system of X. The summons are pointless however. This game could have been great if Basch was the main character and the twists were left for later in the game.
3,a little too much and stupidly hard areas,"So, if you are a FF gamer then you probably already have this. It is a lot of fun, the spells and other graphics are incredible, gameplay is, of course, addictive and the storyline interesting. What wears on you after awhile though is the fact that even after having logged in over 170 hours of gameplay, there are still a multitude of enemies/bosses that are still so stupidly hard to beat that a person just kinda stops caring. Of course all of these enemies are to be found in the secret/side quest areas of FF12 and finishing the game isn't very difficult. And, also, it's traditional for a FF game to have a slew of almost impossible to beat creatures. But it's just not as much fun as it use to be."
3,I'm bored,"First off, I've been a fan of the FF series since number 7, and really enjoyed X (X-2 should not have been made however). In terms of potential, this game has a lot, but it never rises to the occasion. I don't know how far I'm into the game (just fought Cid) but I'm really considering selling it now so I can get the most for my store credit. The game is just really boring, and with the gambit system, all I find myself doing is moving my left thumb around till I reach the next monster. You can play this game half asleep and still advance. Someone else mentioned the lack of skills and I agree. Right now, all 6 of my characters have the entire upper section filled, plus they can wear any armor available. It really doesn't matter who I choose, since they are all the same. Especially since at this point, character development is non-existant. I think I will sell it and put the money towards a Wii... Zelda, I'm coming back!"
4,Final fantasy 12... by george lucas?,"While I enjoy the fact that FF12 has a new system... No sappy love story, better voice overs, and a more engaging battle system. The plot so far, granted Im not finished, has been lifted off star wars it seems... The bad guys are faceless armored guys with british accents and they are called the Empire no less. You get a han solo character (Balthier) complete with a millenium falcon. You have to bust the princess out of jail. And the entire intro movie looks like episode 1!!!"
1,archaic and difficult,"The way the editorial review summarized the material in this textbook as ""archaic and difficult"" pretty much says it all. If you are an instructor looking for a Philosophy textbook for an introductory Philosophy class please keep looking! This is by far the worst textbook I have seen out there. Other texts do a better job of explaining and summarizing the ancient texts than this textbook does, as well as providing a simpler and more concise historical background."
3,Poorly edited puff piece,"Wow - a big-time publisher like John Wiley and they don't even hire a decent editor to cull through Wendy Goldman's galleys? Page after page of errors litter this book. One page, Rupert is walking into his third floor office - next page his office is on the fourth floor. Then back and forth. Goldman has people working at the wrong companies, James - Rupert's son - meeting his future wife at age six (not 26)... and on and on.In addition, Goldman hardly has one bad word to say about anyone in News Corporation. Throughout his career, Rupert Murdoch has never tried to stifle criticism of him nor his actions. Never tried to block a particular book or article. But a book full of this sort of adoration and adulation isn't necessarily going to win Ms. Goldman any points with him.What carries this book is not Goldman's writing, her insights nor the publisher's editing. What carries in the end is the fascinating scope of News Corporation's activities worldwide."
3,Not enough criticism,"I bought this book in anticipation of a learning something new about Murdoch and I unfortunately did not. The books seems mainly to deal with the last two years of News Corporation and while it did provide some behind the scene information a large amount of the information could be gleamed out of reading the news articles that have come out about the Sky Global deal. The author never had anything to say bad about Murdoch or raise any new information but instead rehashed a large amount of news clippings.Additionally, I agree with the reader that stated the author needed to check some facts because you will see mistakes such as when she comments one of his sons started working in 1977 at News but on the next page says that he was born in 1973. Even Murdoch's sons are allowed to have some childhood."
1,Disgraceful,"I'm not sure who commissioned this book to be written, but it is completely disgraceful the lack of any formal criticism or challenges that confront the Murdoch empire. I would get more insight reading a brochure about the company than from this book. Truly disgraceful."
2,So Bad its Funny,"I first saw this on the SciFi channel. My family and I love monster movies. This can't be considered a horror movie or it would get no stars. It appears they filmed this movie over a long weekend in the Canadian mountains.The plot is as typical and highly predicable, but it is fun to wager on who will be the Yeti's next meal. The special effects are abysmal and consistant mostly of a large man in a latex and white fur ape suit. There is some very low end CGI which appears to have been added as an after thought.The best scene involves Peter DeLouise being tackled by a Yeti and then beaten with his own leg before the Yeti takes a bite of it.It's a sad sad attempt at a horror movie but funnier then most bad horror movies. This is a prime candidate for Mystery Science Theater 3000."
1,The 'Y' stands for 'Why did I watch this?',"Is there some kind of curse that prevents there from ever being a good Yeti-themed horror film? If there isn't, this film doesn't help debunk the theory.The premise is pretty simple: TakeAlive, combine it withFriday the 13thcrossed withHarry and the Hendersons, and Presto! Instant Yeti horror film. If only they had invested a screenplay, lighting budget, and semi-decent special effects in that premise, then they might have had a chance.If you like bad movies, by all means, give it a go. Otherwise, keep waiting. A good Yeti horror film is bound to come by sooner or later."
5,Yeti - yes please!!,"This movie is produced with a winning formula - if completely enjoyable and entertaining is a formula. I found the actual footage of Yeti to be completely right for this movie!! I found the couple of interesting plot additives to only enhance and add uniqueness to a story that's hard to stand out with. This is the first of the 'Maneater Series' I wouldn't change or add to. Buy this one!! . . . and if not, rent it . . . you'll LOVE it. . . . and also, the price was well worth it, and the delivery to me was very prompt(!) Thank you."
3,laughable sci-fi,"We first rented this movie knowing it was going to be lame and my family laughed and laughed. When it showed up on my daughters Christmas list, I was a little surprised but when she showed it to some more friends and they laughed and laughed I knew why. It is not for young kids, won't win ANY awards and you can't take it too seriously. But it was cheap enough and will probably come out once a year when my daughter needs her Yeti fix."
2,Stinkeroo,Gave it two stars because it gave us some good laughs. Yeti was a knockoff of the man creatures from Lord of the Rings and not a scare in it.
5,Router Antenna,The 5DBI destop antenna sends the internet signal over 100 feet so that I can use my laptop outside.
1,Disappointed,"No difference at all whatsoever from the standard antena. I don't think this company should sell this product anymore. Don't buy it, you will waste your money."
1,all wrong,"I have over a dozen pairs of Doc Martens. These are the first I have not loved. In fact, I don't like them. First the size, they are about an inch too long. They are cheaply made in China, instead of the quality Doc's used have in England. And since there are only 2 holes, after wearing them all day, you can feel the laces start to press against the top of your foot. And the soles are not the Doc classics. Some cheap, thin rubber.My days of wearing Doc's only are over. Too bad."
3,Mixed Review,I was thrilled to find this book. There's something special about an Italian cookie bakery with the variety of designs and flavors. I tried four recipes. Two were good but were similar to recipes I already had: Coconut Macaroons and Anise cookies. The other two were failures: the Florentines were so thin that they separated from the almonds and the Sesame cookies were inedibly bitter. Many of the recipes use the same base ingredients which makes for easy preparation but somewhat redundant taste. I wished for the more elaborate cookies. My biggest issue was the lack of photos for visual guidance. Also appearance is a huge part of Italian cookies. I'm sure that the absence of photos kept the cost of printing down but it was a false economy. I will try more recipes in this book but will also look for others with more instruction.
2,I prefer to see some pictures.,The recipies may or may not be all that I don't know. But I really prefer to see pictures of what I'm making should like . Cook books without pictures of the items leave too much to be desired for my personal taste.
1,Not worth the money,Sent it back definitely not worth the money. I was disappointed and could write a better talian cookie book myself.
4,True Italian home baking,"These are the cookies -- biscotti -- that your nonna made. These are the recipes you wish you'd asked her for. These are the delicious treats that will carry on your Italian tradition for your family.I am so grateful for this book, and I've given it to many family members. If you're Italian-American, this is an essential for your cookbook collection."
5,CHE FIGATA!!!,Finally an Italian cookie cookbook with authentic tasting recipies! Every cookie I have made from this book taste amazing. I am working my way through the entire book and have mastered twelve recipes to date. The recipes vary in degree of difficulty from intermediate to advanced. The ingredients and equipment required to make the cookies are basic and easily obtained. Ciao!
3,"Decent Size, No Photos",The book arrived as listed! It also doesn't contain any pictures as I was hoping it would. Half the battle in cooking is knowing what the end product will turn out to look like. I skimmed the book for various recipes and there are quite a few I am looking forward to trying. Should come in handy around Christmas time for our cookie bake-off!
3,"Tastes Good, but the texture is all wrong","It may be that I do not have a confectioner's oven, but the texture of my cookies came out all wrong. Still tastes good, but looked nothing like a florentine. Still, it's a fun book to read through. But don't expect fabulous cookies, unless you are willing to make a tester batch and adjust the recipe. Good luck and happy baking."
4,Italian Bakery at Home,"Having grown up in Connecticut amid its wonderful Italian bakeries, I was thrilled to find this cookbook. The fact that the author owns an Italian bakery in Waterbury was enough of a recommendation for me. So far, I have made seven of the cookie recipes, and have enjoyed them all. The only problem I had was running out of pine nuts for the Pignoli cookies. I'll buy twice as many, next time!One reviewer complained about the lack of photos in the book, so I am posting my own."
4,Wedding Cookie Table,I decided to make a cookie table for my daughter's wedding and wanted some authenic Italian cookie recipes to include with my regular cookies. I bought the book because of the cost but would have paid more for pictures too. I've tried many recipes and the cookies are good but I realized that many of the cookies main ingedients are flour and butter and little sugar is used. I learned about Italian cookies and as I shared my cookies more and more people had recipes to share with me. I loved the camaraderie sharing these cookies brought to me.I am prepared to bake cookies in a couple of months and even though we don't have aunts to help I have many volunteers to help me. This book didn't just help with recipes it brought new friends and deepened old ones. Maybe that is the purpose of Italian cookies after all?
4,Sweet Maria's cookies,I am baking cookies for my son's wedding. It is tradition at an Italian wedding to have a cookie table for the guests to enjoy and take home. I found some very tasty recipes in this book that took me back to my Nana's kitchen when I was a child. They are not only delicious but are also beautiful!
5,Like Talking With My Grandmother,"This book contains recipes which were gone when my Grandmother passed away. Although there are many more cookies than she used to make, the ones that she used to make are there. Makes for a wonderful gift to anyone who has an Italian ancestory."
3,well made pack but too small,"I returned this pack after buying it as a replacement for my Targus TXL617. The targus is wearing too quickly but it has way more space than this pack. So, I'll just complain and order another targus. It would be nice if swissgear quality came with a pack having sufficient space. Also, the zipper barely closed on my dell e1705."
3,"Returned bag for poor use of space, got Maxxum instead","This is a very well constructed bag, but the odd design of the diagonal separation between the larger back and middle compartments, and their equal depth, really limits what you can put into the bag. If you want to carry lots of legal pads, this would be a great bag. I want one large section for all of my books, etc., and a thinner section for the computer. I exchanged this for the Maxxum (also Wenger), which is perfect for me, as well as cheaper! The Maxxum also adds an adjustable kangaroo pouch on the front which is very handy. Ah, I should also note that both of these packs have an across-the chest strap that is placed too high. I still use it because it really helps with weight distribution."
5,Perfect,"I bought this bag to carry two laptops: a 17"" Dell Studio and a 14.1"" Dell Latitude E6400. I lug a lot of stuff on business trips and this handles both laptops well, with room for some files and the computer accessories I need when I travel. So far, it has performed flawlessly on two cross-country flights. The price was about where I expected it to be, so I was happy about that as well. I am looking forward to using this bag for a long time."
5,Best I've Ever Had,"This backpack is by fat the best I've owned. Not only is it far superior in comfort, but it also has more smaller pockets to stow away items for cellphones, wallet, mouses etc...But it also has enough room for my books plus computer. Even though my backpack weighs about 20 lbs loaded up it feels so comfortable that it negates the weight. My shoulders are no longer tired and the straps don't cut into my upper traps like the others have after having it on my back for more than 20 minutes. It's also one of the most coolest looking backpacks with its color combo and design. You can take a look at it for yourself by going to you local office supply store and check their prices to the price I got through Amazon ($65)."
5,Great Laptop Bag,"This is my second laptop bag; (Swissgear Pegasus). This bag can handle up to a 17"" laptop and has lots of room for other storage. It is also built very well and will hold up to a lot of abuse. I am hard on my bags. I have a Jansport Odyssey 39 and after 6 months it is showing wear. I give this bag high marks."
4,excellent!,"excellent!! the best backpack I've ever had, all my laptops fit in and it's really good looking, I love it!"
3,"Nice, but heavy","Have owned this bag for about a year now. Use mostly for carrying my laptop, and it's holding up well. Only drawback is the bag is kinda heavy, even unloaded. Guess I'm used to my ultra-lightweight hiking daypacks, which this back is not intended to be."
5,Built like a Swiss Army Knife,"I never really got into the Knapsack thing until this new job and both my counter parts have them. I went ahead and sprung for one and just made the transition over to it. It is very well made and the storage space is well thought out. You definitely get what you pay for. I am an IT eng and carry my laptop, some cables, my notepads, and the convenience of throwing this over your shoulder and having everything self contained in one device is very convenient and comfortable. I don't review much here so hope this helped."
5,Fit for Dell Inspiron 1720,"The Wenger Pegasus backpack's computer sleeve is large enough for the Dell Inspiron 1720 laptop (17 inch widescreen). Put the laptop in a pillow case before loading into the backpack and there's no need to worry about any possible scratching from zipper ....As others have reported, the bag has a classy appearance, is functional, and appears to be well made.Very nice. Glad I bought it."
5,Pegasus backpack,"I really like my Pegasus. My 17"" MacBook Pro fits great and it is amazing how much more can fit into the pockets. I have never been much of a backpack person before, using attaches, so the cable handle lets me carry it easily. The straps also adjust easily to fit on the handle of my rolling suitcase. Bottom line, I'm really pleased with this purchase."
5,I Love this bag!!!,"This bag is great!!! My 17"" Dell Vostro fits well and is snug and secure. I love all the pockets!! It has a pocket for just about every device you could imagine. I don't have one bad thing to say about it."
5,Perfect pack for business travel,I highly recommend this pack for any business traveler. It has all the compartments you need for various items. It is comfortable and stands up no matter how full or empty. The only negative I have is its lack of clips for keys and such. I bought some carabiners for my car key (so I do not worry about it falling out in the airport or wherever).
5,all i need in a bag,"i travel frequently and need to bring quite the collection of electronics. I was able to fit my personal laptop (17.3), work laptop (15.6) and my ps3 slim along with the cords without a hitch! only the 15.6 fit in the designated laptop sleeve probably due to my 17.3 having the 9 cell battery. regardless, this bag does not disappoint."
5,"Great backpack. Fits for XPS 17.3""","Great backpack. Fits for XPS 17.3"" and have a lot more of space for any other things. I even put my XPS 17.3 and my Inspiron 17"" together inside the back pack and they fit perfectly with all the cables and more."
4,Great Product,"I ordered this bag a little over 6 months ago and I love it. I use it every day. I'm a college student and this bag fits my lifestyle. It holds my books, laptop and much more. It's got a neat little compartment that you can store your iPod, calculator, snacks and other little things in. The suspension system works great and helps a lot with distributing the load evenly across my back and relieving my back pain. The only downside on this bag is it is a little bit smaller than I had hoped for. While I still can fit all my books in it, my laptop gets way too much pressure on it, so instead I carry some of them. Overall I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars."
2,"Sturdy outside, poor and small insides","This bag looks solid and it is indeed made of strong materials on the outside (which also makes it a bit on the heavier side). The inside, though, looks like cheap nylon. None of the inner compartments have elastic trims, so they just kind of sag if they're empty. Interior space design needs to be more efficient. The 2-compartment concept makes this bag very poor on storage space. I can barely fit any more than my laptop and gym gear. I used to get a ton more stuff in my old eBags backpack (which is actually smaller and lighter).No, I don't think I would go for this next time around. Problem is that there aren't that many backpacks for a 17 inch laptop."
3,"Barely Fits my 17"" MSI gaming Laptop","I got this bag and tested it with 2 gaming laptops.first the MSI GT780R had a very tight fit and the Velcro strap needs to be stretched to the max in order to stick.second I tried my friends ASUS ROG 17' gaming laptop, It would not fit at all since it has an extra exhaust panel on the back of it which made it impossible to fit.Pros:-Great quality, very rugged and very strong handles.-Bigger than most bags of its kind.-Looks great.-Good price.-ComfortableCons:-Will not fit all 17 inch laptops.-Pockets not made for gadgets and accessories eg : mouse, cables, cameras, mp3, DVDs."
5,awsome,This backpack easily fit my massive 17 inch laptop it looks durable i need to test it out though only just got it i love the 3 pockets for the swiss army knives which i bought one with this bag. it fits everything i think i could ever need without going into the suitcase area of travel
4,Pegasus,"Bag is nice, fits the 17in dell with no problems which is what I needed it for. the only thing I would ask for is a little more space for some other materials though there is some I feel it is not enough. I do however, like the size of the overall size of the bags dimensions."
4,Great Laptop Backpack at an affordable price,"""This laptop backpack fits my Toshiba Satellite X205-S9349 17 inch perfectly, even with a belkin 17 inch neoprene sleeve on. It also has an elastic latching system to secure the laptop, with decent cushioning. The bag has three main compartments, two side pockets and one easy access pocket with an mp3 player slot and strap plus ample cushioning. All in all a great bag at a very decent price."""
5,High Quality Backpack,"This is my first backup from SwissGear and I'm very impressed with their product. It has a very nice look and feel, and it's durable with an incredible amount of space to store stuff. I've had this specific backpack for over 2 years and it is still in terrific condition with no tears, broken zippers, etc. with nearly daily use. The main storage section has space to a decent sized laptop, and it even has room to hold a 2nd one if you need. In total it has 2 side ""nets"" good for storing specific items or unopened bottles/cans, 2 side storage areas with zippers, 3 main storage compartments, and a small section near the top to store keys or other stuff that you need to easily access. I would absolutely recommend SwissGear backpacks to others, and the ""Pegagus"" specifically is a great item."
4,"Good Product, but.......","Does not fit a dell M6500 17"" laptop without stretching the zipper. Perfect for any slightly smaller laptop. Other colleagues' backpacks have failed their Pegasus at the point where the corner of the laptop forces the zipper to bulge out."
5,THE best bag I've ever purchased!,"I absolutely love this bag! I use it for work, for weekend activities, and for traveling. I believe Wenger products are extremely reliable!"
5,Bad zipper,"The backpack is very nice ,but I just got a bad one with a bad zipper.Office max exchanged it for me,and I love it."
3,"Good, but too small","I had to return this backpack because it was too small. I could barely fit three one inch binders and two textbooks. It would be great for someone with just a couple notebooks, but would be a poor choice for a student that needs lots of room."
2,ok pack,solid and well-made backpack. has enough room for a large laptop. only draw back is that the bottle holder is tight and sometimes regular water bottle does not fit in the side pocket if the backpack is full.
4,PEGASUS from SwissGear by Wenger Computer Backpack,It is a good product. It would be better if one or two inches in depth added in the computer packet.
1,No dont buy,"I was looking for a big bag which will carry my 17'' Dell laptop.Yes, the laptop fits in but the space is too cramped.After keeping the laptop, I just had space for two small books.I was not even able to keep my entire laptop accessories.I was planning to keep a day's change of clothes in case I need during my flight.Not only that the space is limited but also the bag itself is heavy which will cause trouble with the present baggage allowance in the airport.If I had a chance, I will definitely return this one.I had bought this bag after months of research and finally it ended up like this.Dont make the mistake of buying this one."
3,"Expected Bigger, but Like What I Got...","I was seriously considering the their bag for the 17"" laptop, but thought it might be more than I need, and I didn't like the color (blue). I find I quickly run out of space in this bag.I am also disappointed by the back panel ventilation in this back - there is no gap in the bottom mesh pad, so air doesn't come through very well."
1,THIS BAG IS SOOOO HEAVY!!!,"This is a HORRIBLE bad. I've had it for a year and a half now and I hate it!! I don't carry very much, but its extremely heavy!! People always comment on how full my bag looks and how heavy it it. Its painful to walk around campus!! I don't recommend this to anyone and am shopping for a new backpack. WASTE OF MONEY"
1,Sticky Zippers,It looks great and has lots of storage space. But the zippers on the two largest compartments jam constantly. It's a real chore to open and close. I regret this purchase.
3,Soft Zippers is an issue,"Generally, this is a good bag, except for the zippers, which do not close properly, skipping ""teeth"", and eventually breaking for that reason. This happens on the angled section all the time, unless you make an effort, lining-up the zippers' sections (it takes several attempts for it to work). So, for the bag to be perfect, the zippers should be more heavy-duty."
4,Very Water Resistance!,"I give it high marks for being very water resistance which most do not provide. I live in the NW region in the USA where there is alot of rain. As you can imagine, your gear needs to be able to keep out the rain or at least resist being soaked. And this bag does it for me. The material and construction seems well built and will withstand the rough and tumble. I gave this bag one less star because of the uselessness of the two side zipper pockets. There's little wiggling room for anything there especially when you stick two large bullet thermos in the two additional spandex side pockets. Another reviewer mentioned this too. But back to the other plus points, I like that it can stand vertically on its own. And yes it can hold at two laptops, one being a 17 inch. Overall, I recommend this backpack."
4,Good backpack,Comfy while wearing. Pockets nicely sized for laptops. Especially like the fact that this pack is streamlined on the exterior. Other backpacks have loose periphials hanging all over them that get caught while turning in tight spaces.
5,A Great Backpack for Business Travelers,"I really like this backpack. I travel a fair amount for business. I need to carry a laptop, notebooks and a variety of personal items. This backpack does a very good job. The laptop is well protected with a lot of padding. This was a very important requirement. The pockets are laid out well for the things that I need to carry. It's comfortable to wear with plenty of padding against my back. It fits under the seats of an airplane. One nice feature that I like is that the bottom is stiff enough that it will stand up by itself. That's very nice when you set it down on it's end, it doesn't fall over. Also, the opening on the laptop pocket is shaped to make it easy to slide a laptop in and out. I recommend it."
3,Better than holding a heavy laptop in a carry case,I have a very large and heavy laptop. Also the laptop power supply's weight is considerable. The company gave me a leather carrying case. I really couldn't fit much else in the case and it was very heavy with the laptop and power supply in it. The backpack makes it easier. It also has alot of extra room for other stuff. The backpack is cushioned. It does make my back hot when wearing it.
4,Great Backpack,"This is a great backpack with lots of storage space everywhere. It's also very well built and rugged (I take it to my job site, so it gets banged around a lot). I have a widescreen laptop, and it fits in there perfectly. Some with a very thick laptop may have problems getting it into the designated pocket, but mine worked fine.My only real beef is that the side net pockets aren't big enough to hold a bottle of water, even though the advertising labels showed it packed like that. Not really a big deal; I still really like this bag."
5,Must Have!,"If you're a fan of wrestling, then this is a DVD you need to add to your collection. Purchased as a gift for my son who has been into wrestling since he was a child....he loved it!"
5,Another Piece of History,WCW Starrcade was a great event over the years that made history in Wrestling and is lost in today sport
5,great wrestling and great wrestlers!,"Remember wheb wrestling was gritty, cool and fun to watch? Remember when wrestlers could actually wrestle and have an entertaining match for 30, 45, or 60 minutes? Remember when being a champion meaned something? Remember how cool tag teams were? Well, now you can remember. Starcade featured the best wrestlers: Flair, Race, Road Warriors, Steiners, Sting, Luger, Windham, Steamboat, Rock N Roll Express, Midnights, Tully & Arn, Magnum TA,and many more, doing what they do best. WRESTLE!"
4,About Time!!!,"Its about time Vince put together a dvd set for just nwa/wcw. There is not much left to say that others have already talked about in reviews. The only prob. I have with the set is the main doc. I find it to be kind of short and it skiped around alittle, all the matches are great."
3,An infomercial for a discontinued product?,"I don't really have any beefs with the matches, but i thought the ""documentary"" aspect of the presentation was pretty lacking in anything resembling in-depth content -- the main thrust of the documentary footage seems to be to drive home the point that Starrcade was a big deal, it's like they're retroactively hyping it to ""add value to the brand"" or however you'd say that in businessman-speak. I stopped watching the documentary portion about halfway through, it was like watching an infomercial for a discontinued product. I also really disliked the lack of associated interview footage for the matches -- i'm sure that having 25 matches didn't leave much room for interviews, et al, but Tully Blanchard's match introductions are rather bland and insipid, and i really love the old interviews. All in all, i think there's a good amount of content here, but, taken as a whole, i find this box set comparatively uninteresting."
4,A Good First Step,"I'm thankful that this is coming out, and many of the matches are going to be good trips down memory lane (I was at the MCI Center for Goldberg/Nash), but I'm still holding my breath for a complete Starrcade set like those that have been released for WWE's big events."
4,nice match set,"I remember voting for this when the set was announced. personally, I did not vote based on ""best matches"" I voted on what matches I did not have on DVD. Sting vs. Hogan was 100% not on my list, but overall decent set."
4,Looking for backround knowledge?,"I enjoyed this dvd because it gave me the knowledge I sought about some of the wrestling industry's past. It was also fun to watch the matches on it, regardless of who was competing.To me, it's always fun to get the facts and backround information about events like this, because I am a fan.In other words, if you're midly interested in wrestling, don't buy this video thinking you'll be amazingly impressed. You won't.If, however, you are a true fan, then you might want to buy this to show your support."
3,Not the best selection of matches,"All of these matches were shown on WWE 24/7 recently, and to be honest, I'm disappointed in the matches that were selected. If you ever saw Starrcade '86, then you ought to be scratching your head wondering why the cage match between the Andersons and the Rock & Roll Express wasn't included in this collection (easily an all-time top 5 Starrcade match). Also, Rick Steamboat vs. Tully Blanchard from Starrcade '84 was another great match, and that wasn't included in this collection, which is beyond me why it wasn't included. I think the best Starrcade match collection that was ever put together was the ""Best of Starrcade"" VHS release back in 1988 that included matches from the first five Starrcades."
1,Disappoimting!,"They briefly mentioned ""Starrcade 90"" from St. Louis which had the Pat O' Connor memorial tag tournament which introduced a lot of ""New"" names to the North American audiences. Obviously the writers chose to believe the crap that it was ""The worst Pay per view in history"" that the internet marks dubbed it because of the god awful Black Scorpion gimmick. The rest of the show was solid. Too bad they never took the time to watch it themselves and make the decision."
4,WWE DID IT AGAIN,"The collection is nice but once again the WWE screwed up. Where is Ric Flair VS. Ronnie Garvin, Starcade 1987. One of the greatest matches of all time."
4,New old stock,"This was another good deal from Amazon. Deliver was timely and the warranty is the usual Amazon type. It had the cheapest price at the time.It looks like this watch was a new old stock item as it was released for 1996-1998 collection. Omega reference is ST 375.0083. Caliber number: 1152.Its case is a bit smaller than current similar models, but functionality is the same (Date, split-seconds, tachometer, chronograph)."
3,Puppy umbrella,"While this is a cute umbrella, the quality does not liveup to the price.LAMPS BEAUTIFUL Rain or Sun Umbrella--Puppy Roadtrip--Excellent customer service--see our feedback.Upon opening, the top button broke off both of the two whichI purchased for my two granddaughters. There was not enough timeto replace them before Christmas. However, the companydid refund the full purchase price by crediting my Amazonaccount & subsequently my credit card, within three days ofmy contact with the company - - an excellent company withwhich to do business, especially if the product is defective."
4,Add tracking to your Orion german mount tripod,"The EQ-3M attaches to your Orion EQ-3 or EQ-2 Tripod's right ascension gear to give you the ability to guide and track when your equatorial german mount tripod is polar aligned. This saves you from constantly adjusting the telescope when observing objects in the night sky. It also comes in handy when you are imaging with your scope on one of these mounts. It helped making mosaics of the moon with a webcam a bit easier. It doesn't match the ease of use of a ""GoTo"" computerized mount, but its the next best thing, if you just need to track the objects you are observing."
1,STUPID CHICKS!,"The Dixie Chicks need to get a life! They couldn't sing if they tried (which they don't) and ""Goodbye Earl"" is not as funny as they made it out to be. First of all, they screwed up by making fun of murder, by basically telling everyone that if your husband beats you, KILL HIM! You won't get caught if you hide it well enough! Domestic violence is not a humourous issue, and murder is not the solution. What was Natalie thinking with that voice? Not that she could carry a tune before, but what's with that? I thought this was COUNTRY music! PLEASE!"
1,ignorance,"in regard to the song goodbye earl,i find this song to be ignorant of the seriousness of the issue of domestic violence. i work at a shelter for battered women. there is nothing funny about domestic abuse. this is a VERY serious issue and should not be portrayed as comical as in this song. obviously the dixie chics need some education on this issue. Domestic Violence is a serious situation and the women who are victims should not be stereotyped as the song portrays them. in the future i along with many others will not be supportive of the dixie chics."
3,Goodby Saddam?,I thought violence wasn't the way to solve problems? I guess it depends on the situation.
5,RADICAL!,"The Dixie Chicks ""Good Bye Earl"" has an abusive message to the abusive women of America but it is still a good song to listen to for people with a good heart. Before the criticism starts to ""FLY"" please keep in mind that a MAN wrote the song ""GOOD BYE EARL"" As far as I am concerned the Chicks can keep on ""Rockin"""
3,"In with a bang, out with a whimper","This CD starts out really strong, keeps it going for about 3/4 of the way through and then, on the last few songs just wimps out. Can you imagine them playing Sly and the Family Stone in ""Animal House""? Neither can I. Nevertheless, if you can program your CD player to leave off the last few tracks, this CD is worth it."
4,"I love true affection, but this album is not for me","I love the song true affection, and I love her voice, but the rest of the songs are just not for me. I was pretty bummed there was nothing else along the lines of true affection, it's such a unique and interesting song."
1,Who blew the rhythm away?,"This album blows. At least the artists got the name right. I really hope ""ReaderWriter"" is a stooge for the record company behind this crap cause if a person honestly believes this is the future of music, cut off my ears. The chick's voice has no passion, the beats are unmelodic and off-rhythm. I felt like I would rather asphyxiate myself with stale horse farts than continue listening to 9 of the 10 tracks. Please, let all copies of this album be burned immediately (ReaderWriter can be our kindling)."
3,"Does what is should, overheats easily though",I bought this to power my DC carpc in the house when I needed to work on it. Its DC power supply pulls 6 amps and this power supply overheated and went into protection mode after about 2 hours. It cooled down and powered up again after about an hour. Dont know if anyone else had this issue. It is very convienient and the other 13.8 VDC outputs are nice to have as well.
4,Good Rockin' Harmonies,It goes without saying that doo wop worked well with rockin' tunes as well as ballads. A good mix of songs that should satisfy lovers of harmony.
1,Real review after buying 2,"I recently purchased two of these slingshots for a party event. I was truly disappointed with the product in several ways including:- The water balloons are tiny and break almost instantly if you add more than a small amount of water- The water balloons are so small they are extremely hard to tie a knot- The water filler devices are difficult to use and barely fill the water balloon- The sling shot itself almost always resulted in a broken water balloon upon release without ever getting the balloon in the airNever thought a product bundle could be so bad. After 20 frustrating minutes, we threw both kits in the trash."
3,better have 3 strong adults !,"This thing will throw a balloon but with 4 boys in the house under 10, no one could do it. My wife and I even held the ends but my 10 year old did not have the strength to pull it back. I would consider this an adult only toy as you must have three adults to use it. Older and stronger teens as well."
5,Keeps my tape drive in working order,"We purchased a new server and new tapes along with it. To ensure that the tape drive continues to work, we also purchased this cleaning tape, and so far, so good."
5,Worth every penny!,We have this set for ABA. We have had it for 2years now and the cards are all in great condition. We use them everyday. Worth every penny!
3,"Good song witing, bad recording.","The song writing is good it is just that the recording sounds like someone did with a karoke machine and a sick tuba.You listen to Gary's version I didn't know I loved you till I saw you rock and roll then review Rock Goddess' you'll see what I mean.Doing allright with the boys, I love, you love..., Do you wanna touch me (oh yeah) again great tunes but listen to Gary's then Joan Jett's.The writing is great but it sounds like a demo tape made with a karoke machine."
3,Only the music......please!!!,"If you like glam rock this is ok, but an album with the greatist hits of glam rock will serve you better.....if you are some idiot that wants to compare the music to the man------Please, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THE SOCIAL COMMENTARY!!!"
1,A Waste Of Resources,"But not a waste of talent because anyone buying this CD will realise very soon that Glitter had no talent. Early 70`s glam rock was the nadir of music and fashion and Glitter was the worst of the glam artists. Every song is three cords all the way through , think Status Quo with a bass drum machine in the background , or think of a 12 inch single that goes on for an hour with a few seconds break every 3 minutes and you`ve got the musical and artistic content of this CD. If you still buy this CD after what I`ve told you you must be either very stupid or just plain deaf, but even that`s not a good enough excuse for wasting your money on this"
1,Gimme a break!,"Glitter has obtained 99% percent of his fame in the US as being lead mushmouth in ""Rock & Roll Part II,"" the song played immediately after a goal in scored at most NHL games. Glitter may have to take some responsibility for the current trend of unintelligible, droning lyrics in pop music because of it. If you want to hear the song he ripped off to get ""R & R Pt. 2,"" check out ""Doctorin' the Tardis"" by the Time Lords (you don't have to be a Dr. Who fan to appreciate the tune). As for his being popular in England--so is Liza Minelli and bland food, what's your point?"
1,Don't Buy This Album!,"In 1999 Gary Glitter was convicted of child pornography charges in British courts. On December 23 of 2002, Mr Glitter was deported from Cambodia due to 'deviant sexual practices.' This is all the more stupefying when major news sources like CNN are unafraid to describe Cambodia as ""a country with a reputation as a safe haven for child sex offenders."" That the man could be depraved enough to be deported from Cambodia leaves me seriously uncomfortable at the thought that he could be procuring royalties from the sale of this album. Please think twice about buying this album."
1,Be careful of Twinlab's quality control!,"I have purchased this product a few times now and had no complaints. However, the last purchase of vitamin C, which is (always) packaged in a glass jar, was horrific! At the end of the use of the product, there were a few very small pieces of broken glass at the bottom of the bottle! I called Twin Labs to alert them and maybe get some compensation. Their response was, ""Oh, that happens from time to time, that's just how it is. There is really nothing we can do about it."" And that was it, no apology, no compensation. I would be very careful about buying any products from Twinlab in a glass jar. Who knows if you or your child will swallow a piece of glass! Look for other companies with the same product. Any company that doesn't care about their quality control, should not deserve our loyalty to them."
1,Not helpful,"I picked up this book because I wanted to be better equipped to help people who are victims of domestic violence. Unfortunately, the book didn't help.Instead of signs of abuse, understanding the one abused, stategies of care, cautions, and things to avoid (which would really be helpful), Rev. Miles spends most of the book ripping Pastors for not doing a better job. In other words, what he apparently thinks Pastors need to know is that they are inept. I don't find that helpful at all.If you want real help in being a helper . . . this is not the book."
5,"Really, every pastor NEEDS to know this information","It's refreshing to hear about domestic violence from a male perspective. It's especially refreshing to read about it from a male minister's prospective. Rev. Al Miles does several important things in this vital resource: he defines domestic violence and presents helpful information about its prevalence; he addresses the very real concerns, fears, and spiritual struggles of victims/survivors; he provides excellent exegetical work on some of those difficult Biblical passages that abusers often use to excuse their violence (or worse, to ""prove"" that it's sanctioned by God); and he offers hope. Reading this book should be required of every minister--it's that vital to the Christian church and, more importantly, the people we serve."
4,The man can play the blues!,"Johnny Winter has rockin' good time blasting out blues tunes collected from the 60's and 70's. His playing ranks with any great blues guitarist, and his vocals have the raw edge to pull of these ""scorchers."" Five of the cuts are his own compositions and his songs stand up against classic blues tunes like ""Mean Mistreater"" so well only a true blues archivist would be able to tell the difference. The jam on ""Mean Town Blues"" is a phenomenal closer to the CD. A great collection of some of Winter's best work."
1,Paroled,Don't waste your money. You're better off looking at the trailer which was why I purchased it in the first place. Ernest Thomas doesn't speak in the entire movie and the story line sucked!!!! What a dispointment -- I can't even give this DVD away.
3,lackluster but well recorded,"i've admired bronfman's playing primarily through the beautiful series of chamber discs he recorded with mintz; against that standard these prokofiev concertos are a disappointment. the overall approach is surprisingly literal and metronomic, with a lack of lyrical fire or virtuosic ice, and tempos (especially in the outer movements) that are slower than usual. soloist and conductor seem to play in parallel rather than in close partnership. (it's as if bronfman and mehta were thrown into the studio without enough rehearsal time.) all the keyboard notes are perfectly in place, and the orchestral detail is exceptionally clear, but these are recordings better suited for studying the performance score than for encountering the full range of prokofiev's unique poetry."
1,"Good perfs, BUT beware defective CDs!","Bronfman's set of Prokofiev Piano Concertos is quite good, but having ordered and returned several defective copies of the disc containing 1, 3 and 5, I am beginning to despair that I will never hear the end of #1 or the beginning of #3 without a loud clicking sound. I see another post about this same problem from over a year ago. For shame!(Oh, and btw, the disc with 2 and 4 is fine.)"
2,Weird little EP,"Not their finest work. I think its their first EP and it shows. I like Mikeschair, and they tend to have catchy melodies. But this EP is a little slow, and doesent really sound like them. Only paid $5, so i guess it wasnt a terrible waste. Ill remember to research before i buy."
1,frustration/dissapointment,"After reading all the glowing reviews about this nailer I was convinced that this was the tool.However this tool has experienced intermittent jamming since first out of the box in fact the most useful feature of this gun is the onboard allen wrench which is used to remove the nosepiece which in these days of ergonomics is somewhat archaic in that it even requires a seperate tool to clear the jams especially in a tool that jams this often . I have other nailers that don't require tools & several that never have jammed. This has finally gotten to the point where I am prepared to toss it & go for the less expensive, more reliable & more easily serviced Bostich.Judging from all the other writeups & reviews I would say my experience is unique. For the sake of other tool users I would hope so but given the high expectations I had for this tool I would say it is the biggest disapointment I've owned."
3,Good little saw,"This saw works well at cutting but it's a pain in the a$$ that the blade keeps coming out. The tension screw to hold the blade in place only does so much, when you are sawing, it still works it's way out. Not bad if you are just doing light work here and there but if you are going to use it a lot, there could be a better made saw out there."
5,Excellent Scholarship,"No more bird bath type view of who Francis is. With the most up to date scholarship, Franciscan scholars have put together the best English translations with a commentary that can guide you through the medieval world in wich these early documents of Francis of Assisi were written. I find the commentary particularly useful in my own personal study as well as meditation so as to make Franciscan spirituality meaningful to today. The Volume Two focuses on Francis as the founder of the Franciscan movement of communities of lesser brothers (friars minor), poor ladies (poor Clares nuns) and the tertiaries (regulars and seculars). This is essential reading for Franciscans and franciscans-at-heart to find out what Francis has wanted his followers to do."
4,Eye opener,"This book was truly an eye opener. So many girls are being abused under this religion, it seems we are all allowing this right under our noses. I am just amazed at the amount of brainwashing going on with all this unfortunate people."
5,Could not put down,Loved the detail. Loved the thoroughness. Loved that the entire book was devoted exclusively to her childhood. Hope she is writing a sequel.
4,Keep Sweet,"I confess to thinking of polygamy as an innocuous aberration. Keep Sweet has destroyed my wrong impression and I'm grateful. The authors reveal the devastating damage caused by groups like Bountiful and do so not by being preachy but by simply telling an impelling story that makes the point more powerfully than any lecture could ever do. The story is told with painful, simple honesty from the point of view of a child. The courage it took to escape and build a new life is truly inspirational. The cruelty of polygamy is shocking and an expose like Keep Sweet is important if one wishes to truly understand what these groups are really all about. Well done."
1,Cheaply made!,"Received this prodcuct on time, however I am a photographer heading to Africa on a photo shoot and need something better made...the pockets seem very cheaply sewn.(made in China, where else?) I need a place to stash lenses and filters etc. Even my plastic Nikon lenses would probably rip these pockets after awhile. Can't imagine what the old metal Nikon lenses would do to it! I am returning it to spend more money on a better made product. Fishermen or just weekenders might be satisifed with it as long as you don't strain the pockts with heavy stuff. You get what you pay for."
1,"Waste of time, waste of money","This travel vest looked fine until it was washed. It came out of the washer looking like a rag. I followed the instructions, but was unprepared for all the velcro closures to be stuck to the mesh back. Trying to get them loose without damaging the mesh was impossible. The fabric was totally wrinkled and didn't hang out. And how to you iron the pockets back into shape! Don't purchase this item."
5,The Weekender Vest,"Very light and comfy I love it ,good quality for a decent price I am happy with this purchase.I wish they make it also in black ."
1,Mirror falls off,"Mirror itself was fine, but the supplied tape attachment for the 98 Mustang is useless. Mirror loosened up in the summer heat and wind buffeting, then fell on the ground and broke."
4,Envelopes,I was very happy to find these envelopes. I needed them to go with the paper I alread have. Thank you.
2,Not very happy . . .,"This is my 5th gundam model and I would say , I am not very happy with this model asit has a lot of flaws. I was surprised with all of the 5 star reviews that's why i decidedon this purchase, I am not sure if they were able to get a nicer model though but the one Ireceived was low grade plastic model gundam compared to the othermodels I have built . Connections are falling apart, most of the joint connections areexposed and falling apart, maybe if you glue them together it won't come apart( never done it with my other Gundam toys). Very limited range of motion..."
4,Very Nice...,"Well, as this was my first Gundam Model kit in about 5 years, I had to say this was the kit to rediscover my love of gundam model kits.This kit is well put together. The injected mold parts are tough and easy to cut out of the frames. When building it was a lot of fun and I must say it looks pretty good. Although I recommend getting it painted, as the only stickers that really look any good are those that go on to the Buster Sheild.Once built, it looks pretty awesome, but it has a few defects. As this is an earlier model kit, it is a bit more fragile then its newer counterparts (such as the Gundam 00 and Seed models) And some parts are a bit loose, such as the hands and booster pack. It has a bit of a hard time holding it's scythe at any angle, but if you finese it a bit it works just fine.Overall, I would recommend getting this model. It looks good, builds great, and it's deathscythe Hell, who doesn't love it?"
1,I was once a self help junkie too ...................,"People buy this author's books because she comforts them by telling them what they want to hear. Unfortunately that is not the whole truth, so the books offer solutions that don't work. But they work for the author, because the books sell.So go right ahead and enrich the author. Give her your money in exchange for the book, and then your valuable time reading and thinking about and applying what she says. You will be poorer, she will be richer. That is the fundamental transaction with all self help books. But at least for a little while you will believe the dream."
5,Jim Taylor's Doo Wop Heaven Review,"I grew up during the 40's and 50's. I saw a great many doo wop artists and the oldies at the State Theater in Hartford Connecticut, and mostly for under a dollar.This is a great album.I am a retired Hartford CT Fire Captain, the author of the 1969 essay ""What is a Fire Fighter?"". And I and play rare Doo Wop and oldies at [...]"
1,Bad Advertisment,You advertise that the 2 year extended warranty is 2 years for $19.95 or this is how it appears. I asked about this and instead of clarifying anything you cancelled my order completely. I wanted the warranty I just needed a clear answer on why you attempted to bill me twice the $19.99. I did not want it to be cancelled. If someone would have read my emails then this would not have happened. I am very dissapointed.
4,TI 86,This was the correct book for our TI. The condition was like new. The book contained everything we needed to operate our TI-86.
1,"Poor description, Looks nice","Had ordered this item to try to replace pocket door pulls with an existing cutout. A frustratingly limited amount of information is available to the potential purchaser, so I am uploading pictures.Without opening the package, and measuring through the blister pack, the item measures 2.5"" wide x 2.75"" tall in the finished (visible) dimensions. Cut out requirements measured on the blister pack (see photos) list cut out as 1-3/4"" deep (wide) by 2-3/16"" tall.Out of two items, one came without the screws to attach to the door. The one with screws had one corner bent in.Although Amazon lists the item as V1950, the Manufacturers part number is actually N326-306. Unfortunately, even the manufacturers website does not list the finished dimensions of the product.My search for a replacement door pull continues.If it fits your application, and arrives undamaged it looks nice."
1,poor shipping,Received this item in good shipping package but the product package was open and appeared as if it had been dropped on the floor and used for skating. Obviously this was the condition in which it was shipped and a VERY irresponsible way to do business. I will avoid any further transactions with national hardware which is a shame since I recently purchased an entire house of door knobs and was very happy with my purchase but I refuse to take a chance in the future since timing was very important in this instance.
1,to shallow to grip :(,"the area your fingers are supposed to ""grip"" this door pull is TOO SHALLOW. the surface is too smooth and the 'indent' is too shallow to get a grip on the door.Now I have to find, buy and install a secondary chrome door pull."
1,Very little value for money,"I found the book of very little value. Most of steel structures these days gets calculated and drawn up by computer. The assembly of the computer generated panels are dead easy and far cheaper than doing it by hand. More time should have been spent discussing the various options regarding cladding, insulation, utilities etc."
2,Received the OLD edition,"This is possibly my fault for not reading the fine print, but I was disappointed to find that the edition the vendor sent me is from the 90's. I'm not sure how reliable the information is going to be! I wish they would have been more explicit about the publish date in the product description... now I pretty much need to buy a second copy of this one."
2,Did they leave the main city ever?,"I read this book on my way to Mumbai and when I arrived I thought the plane landed in another country or city. The book was great for Mumbai proper, but once you get out to the suburbs, where people actually live, the book was useless."
3,"Worthy Hymns, Mediocre Presentation","This was one of the first Christian cds I owned and I love many of the hymns on it for their lyrics and their melodies. Ultimately, I got rid of the cd due to the overblown vocals and stylistic inconsistencies.As another reviewer pointed out, the interpretations do not always match the content of the hymns. Additionally, the ""choir"" sounds like a group of soloists who frequently forget that they are supposed to be singing as a choir, blending their voices into one; the music is often lost in the midst of more than one singer launching off into an embellishment.That said, if you want this as a musical backdrop and don't listen to the particulars very much, this is a perfectly acceptable contemporary presentation of classic hymns."
1,Major software and driver problems,"Read a lot about the 6800 and was looking forward to using it. After hours of trying to install the drivers, both the one included on the CD and the update on the Microtek website, I finally gave up. The computer would recognize the scanner if I was using Photoshop but not if I was using it as a stand alone. Big problem since the Digital Ice feature (the reason I bought this scanner) only works through their proprietary software. I compared the scans in Photoshop with others I had done with an inexpensive HP All-In-One. There was basically no difference. Not wanting the headache of endless time spent with tech support, I packed it up and sent it back. Now looking for an alternative."
1,probably incompatible with Mac OS10.4,"Although my scanner is a 5900, which will not work with my new Mac (G4, running Tiger 10.4.2), this one uses the same ""ScanWizard 5"" software package so the odds are pretty good that the 6800 won't work on current Macs either. This failure is after numerous contacts with their tech support and repeated downloads of drivers, but for some reason it will not load the ""scanner finder"" - obviously a critical component. I have given up and will upgrade, probably to a Canon, but what a waste of what SHOULD be a still-functional item."
4,Necessary for the CXS fan collection,"I've been built up as a Cruxshadows fan for some years now. For some reason, I hadn't managed to get this DVD until recently.If you consider yourself to be a fan of the Cruxshadows, you should own this DVD. The concert itself doesn't quite compare to (of course) being there, or even to listening to the music on your own and envisioning it all...but it's certainly an enjoyable experience that all fans should enjoy.If you're a newcomer, then you need this even more. You should see where the band you now know came from, and this is the way to do it. On top of one of their biggest performances, the DVD includes interviews and featurettes that really help you to feel as though you know the band closer.All in all, it's a must-buy."
3,Good book!!,I bought this book because I need to look for connections between groups and the graph complement of a graph G. The book is ok but unfottunately I did not find information about the topic I am researching.
1,Not funny,"This book is ridiculous and not funny at all. I bought this for my husband, a pilot, thinking it would contain funny stories and antecdotes - but it just has a lot of cheesy, dumb jokes, puns and pathetic quips no pilot would ever actually say.If you're looking for a book about aviation, don't buy this."
2,Only for REAL enthusiasts,"I'm not a pilot or an aviation industry worker, but I still had loads of fun with other aviation humor books. This one didn't appeal to me, though. It was mildly funny occasionaly, at best. It's obviously targeted for real pilots and aviation workers, so the occasional reader won't even understand most of the jokes. Maybe aviation professionals or hardcore enthusiasts will find it entertaining."
4,Good shorts,"I've ridden in these shorts several times and they are comfortable for 2 hour rides on rocky mountain trails. Around 3 hours my butt gets a little sore, but that just might be my seat or rolling over rocks for 2 hours. these shorts fit well, better than the Canari gel liner shorts, and don't give you a saggy bottom.They are not good to walk in at all. I had to walk 3 miles because of a flat tire and I got a rash on my butt from the chamois and I was not happy. Don't walk or run in these shorts for long distances or you'll get a rash too.Overall good shorts wih gel padding. The logo rubbed off my shorts within 1 month of wear, but the material is a decent qaulity. Good value for the price."
3,OK bike shorts,"Not comfortable enough for long rides, but for a ride around town for an hour or so they are fine. They work best for short rides in warm weather. The fabric is very comfortable, but the padding is minimal."
4,Nice Bike Shorts,"These are a decent pair of bike shorts. I have others with slightly better padding, but this pair is typical for biking and true to fit."
3,Dearest Ones,Dearest Ones: A True World War II Love StoryI loved the book but it was a little fragmented. I was born in London 1941 and experienced The Blitz of 1944. Nice to hear about it through an American's eyes.
4,Another Side of WWII and the Women who Served,"Dearest Ones is a wonderfully touching historical account of WWII and of the untold heroines of the war. This is a must read for all WWII historians, it provides a different account of the war and the untold efforts that went into the war effort. The authors details in her letters home carry the spirit and humor of those who served with the Red Cross overseas.I have had the pleasure of meeting several of the women who served with American Red Cross overseas. They are truly wonderful women, who continue to serve their country, community, and the Red Cross with the compassion and spirit that Rosemary describes in Dearest Ones. Keeping in mind many of these women are grandmothers, and great-grandmothers, they have more energy, happiness, and effervescence than I do at 22- they are truly irreplaceable and inspiring. Read this book to capture their love, inspiring nature, and the sparkle of their unique lives."
3,Story Songs for Country Folks/ Faron Young,"Faron Young signed with Mercury Records in 1963 after ten years at Capitol. This import CD from Australia compiles tracks from three of his Mercury albums: ""Story Songs for Country Folks"" and ""This is Faron Young"" both from 1963, and ""Unmitigated Gal"" from 1966. His style then was typically mid-sixties country, and his performances are first rate. But the songs in this collection have not been digitally remastered. The liner notes even suggest that they may have been merely transfered from the vinyl. Furthermore, more than half of them are the monaural versions. The CD label makes no reference to copyrights, licensing, or Polygram, which has the rights to the Mercury masters. This leads me to think that the CD release might even be unauthorized, as well. Having the LPs already, I probably would not have purchased this CD if I had known all of this beforehand."
4,"Wonderful, but small, books.","Our daughter loves her Curious George books (she's barely 2 years old) and particularly loves the illustrations as well as the stories that are narrated in these books. Our only concern is that the words in this miniature set are so small that it isn't practical to use these books to teach her to read. If this is of concern to you, then you are better off paying more money and getting the larger books, otherwise these books are great!"
3,"Good books, but need to be sturdier","I bought this set because our family travels quite a bit; we live overseas. Our daughter LOVES the books--the content is a lot of fun. However, as far as being suitable for travel, the set's main advantage is only its size. It is nice to be able to slip the books in anywhere. However, the thin box soon began to fall apart, and the binding on each book hasn't held the back pages well. As far books to take traveling, I should have chosen something bound better, like a hardcover."
5,The deepest set of books you should never leave home w/o.,"Funny, optimistic, a full set of adventures in a mini boxed-set small enough to accompany everyone on their jouney through this jungle we call life"
3,Simplicty Itself,"Nice, simple piece of hardware - easy to use and easy to take for granted.Only issue in hindsight: I should have popped the extra money to get a larger size drive - at least a gig. Amazing how you run out of space quickly here..."
5,1 Samuel Study,"As usual, this commentary provides insight to understanding the books of the Old Testament. Wiersbe provides cross-references between various books in the Old & New Testament and provides unbiased views. If your looking to better understand 1 Samuel , read this book as part of your study."
3,Romeo type SS,"This is a very nice model of an unusual subject. The kit builds very well with little filler needed. This was my one of my first models from Trumpeter and I have buying other kits from them ever since. I got/built it a few years ago. There is a kit if the SSG version of this boat. That kit included the parts to build the SS version also, so if you are not sure which you want get the missle boat kit. This is a nice addition to a collection to show the evolution of the modern SS as it's lineage from the German type XXI is clearly evident. Built it is about 21""long."
5,"Great, well written book for tyers",Step by step instructions in plain English that help you get started on your way to tying your own flies.
1,Vivitar DVR 200,"Poor product. Even at very fine setting for recording, the videos are quite poor-almost like watching somoene on a computer's video camera. It uses an incredible amount of power, even lithium batteries burn out fast...very fast! Very disappointing."
5,Honest Portrayal for Children,Honest portrayal for children that gives them an idea about the Holocaust and the harshness imposed on people. It is good to assure the Holocaust is not forgotten.
1,Since when?,"I've made the mistake of reading a couple of her books. She had nothing worthwhile 2 say. Now she has the audacity to write a book on writing? Maybe she should read it herself. Better still, read David Gerrold's book on writing.JD"
3,Like?,"This book appeals to me because I have an interest in artists and their habits, work areas and thought processes. I'm not an artist but somehow I understand them. This book has some good regular humor in it. The author claims a book is a painful piece of labor and it shows. Fair enough. I like it but it's not a book destined to be a classic. It's not even of general interest.But I'll read the whole work. Some of it's observations are profound."
5,"Not a tutorial, but an inspiration!","Though Dillard does not provide step-by-step instructions for writing, she inspires words and analogies, she forgives slow steps, and warms the reading heart. I am thoroughly enjoying her simple but labored words."
3,RAISING ONESELF BY ONE'S OWN BOOTSTRAPS,"This book first got into my hands in 1991 because of a reference in ""Pilgrimage"" magazine and because of a small recommendation by my therapist.As a book on how to write, it is empty. As a source of entertainment and inner delight, it is like a dream. Some parts of it resonated in this reader with tremendous power while other parts remained opaque and inscrutable.I liked best one paragraph, one idea, which I care to quote because of the strong convicted opinion that is in it:""People who read are not too lazy to flip on the television. They prefer books. I cannot imagine a sorrier pursuit than struggling for years to write a book that attempts to appeal to people who do not read in the first place."""
5,"Annie Dilliard, The Writing Life... Very Powerful!","This book was given to me many years ago, when I lived in Greenwich Village, but a very wise and beautiful young woman. By the time I finished the book, two things were clear... My life was transformed, and the gift giver cared about me and understood me. Great book, highly recommended, and most importantly, should not be limited to those who want to consider becoming writers. This book speaks more of life than of literature. My respect for Annie Dilliard is immense, and my recollections from this book are everlasting.."
1,not the writing life,"If you were looking for a book that told how she spent her days writing and how she planned a book, this isn't it. a lot a memories and philosophical yakking and abstraction, but very little about her writing process or how she spent her time on a day to day basis. Given the title of the book, it was not what I was looking for."
1,Baaad,Not good. Actually it was awful. I am thinking about trying my hand at writing the great American novel. Chances are it would be better than this.
3,"A Bit of Inspiration, Not Advice","The Writing Life is filled with beautiful language, and many thoughts that any writer can relate to, but it is no how-to guide. Those who are looking for something to give practical guidance had best look elsewhere. Dillard descibes what it is like to be a writer - what a writer may think (or need to think). The book offers inspiration, but little practical help.However, for those who are looking for a little pick-me-up, Dillard's book is ideal. This book would also interest avid readers who would like to see inside the mind of a writer and get some understanding of what the writing process can really be like."
5,The Writing Life,"I loved reading this book. It's definitely a keeper- a book to come back to again and again. It is not a toolkit. It is exactly what it says it is - a book about the writing life, what living is like for a writer. It is full of insights that will feed your life and, therefore, your writing. It's full of wisdom, wonder and wit. My favorite chapter is on the typewriter, but it's all good. Don't miss it."
2,Not really my thing...,"Maybe it's got too much Nature in it. However, I wouldn't actually call it poorly written, so much as self-indulgent. Surely, every dedicated writer can't seal herself off from the world like Dillard does here."
2,Less Than Writing,"The book is beautifully written but--if you are looking for practical advice to improve your writing--go elsewhere. If you are looking for insight into how Annie creates her magic on the page, you won't find much of it. The book is little more than a series of well crafted journal entries on a series of barely related topics. I smiled once or twice, but the book was a lot less than I expected."
2,Not inspirational,"As a writer with only one published novel I am always looking to learn more about the writing life, looking to hone my skills, to improve. I had hoped to glean some rare look into how to write skilfully from Dillard's writing. This 111 page book took me three days to read (normally I would have finished in 30 minutes) however I wanted to absorb each gem of knowledge, and so kept reading intently, taking breaks hoping it would get better the next time I picked it up. Most writers seem to spend an inordinate amount of time doing anything to avoid writing Dillard seemed to spend most of her time avoiding writing about writing, and if that was not annoying enough - I wanted the good stuff - the time she did spend on the writing life was so depressing that if I was reading this book in hopes of becoming a writer I'd have probably gone a slit my wrists. What a complete waste of time this book was."

3,"Good for the""common folk"".Great if you live in Yuppie Land.","As I turned the corner into my fifties I realized that I really did not want to or need to strive as much to have more junk. I was also on a trendmill of buy, send,buy send and buy send some more. This book has really centered me and made me realize that I had better wake up if I want anything positive to be there for my retirement. I may be a little on the late side. The book seems to focus on a younger more educated cliential, and this is my big beef. I am a well paid blue collar worker. I cannot get a sabbatical nor can I just up and leave for the great outback. The reality of it is that most of us are ""stuck"" in one way or another and are not as talented or educated as the people that Luhr's interviewed for the book. The plus side of the book are the many tips and constant self talk that can help one realize that we do have some choices and even if we do have good paying dead end jobs we can change in many ways to improve our lives."
2,Good for you if I have to cram it down your throat,"True, there's good advice in these pages, and it's presented in a convenient digest format (all of this territory has been covered before, by among others, Don Aslett, Jane Brody, and Thoreau). My problem is the author's self-righteous tone; although she begins, promisingly enough, by saying that ""simple living has nothing to do with your level of income,"" she soon makes it clear that she will brook no slaggards, and that the leaner your existence, the better your person. Amy Dacyczn, the founder of the Tightwad Gazette, is pretty hardcore on the subject of paring down to the basics, yet her books are written with good humor and an awareness that she is, indeed, on the fanatical fringe; she is much more tolerant of the fact that people march to different drummers, something Luhr preaches but does not seem to really believe. If you enjoy being lectured, Simple Living will give you several days' worth."
3,The concepts are provocative; the book too long.,"I found the first chapter of this book detailing the concept of Simple Living and the second involving money as it applies to this concept quite thought provoking. It encourages one to evaluate priorities and to avoid being enslaved to things; the idea being the more ""stuff"" you have, the more you have to work to pay for it, the more time you have to invest to maintain it, etc. The remaining chapters became redundant and boring."
4,"A great, but somewhat dated resource","I think this is a great resource for anyone just embarking on a journey of simplicity. It's full of ideas and inspiration that will help you on your way.My only gripe is that the financial sections are dated. Some of it seems quite naive in light of the recent financial crisis. For example, pay yourself first is still a very important concept but the advice on where to invest is almost comical given the recent upheaval. Additionally, many of the economic assumptions are flawed. Nearly all the examples on savings, investment, and compound interest assume a 10-15% return on investment. Who, besides the credit card companies, actually gets that kind of return anymore? Of course hindsight is 20/20, but that same hindsight could be used to rewrite the financial sections -- which is sorely needed.So personally I highly recommend this book, but advise that you supplement the financial advice with more recent sources."
5,A full of resources book though slightly outdated.,"This book is full of amazing suggestions and resources in simple living. Luhrs defines simplicity as conscious, deliberate living, ""stopping for a moment and asking what the heck we are doing with our lives"". After this introduction, she then went to talk about time, money, inner simplicity, work, simple pleasures and romance, virtues, families, holidays, cooking and nutrition, health and exercise, housing, clutter, gardening, and travel. At the end of each chapter, there is a list of books, websites, and other resources to help us learn more about the topic. What's helpful was her short summary in each of the resources she listed.Though I wish there is a new edition of this book with updated resources, I continue to reread and use this book as a reference. I highly recommend this book for those who are interested in living more consciously and taking as little as possible from this earth that we share."
3,Repetitive,"I liked the general idea of the book, however, I found much of it to be redundant. Some of the ideas were too harsh for my lifestyle. The beginning of the book dragged a bit but the last two thirds were more interesting. I think this book would be excellent for someone who is disiplined and willing to have a simple life. It is not very good for the weak at heart."
3,Good advice hidden in hocus-pocus spirituality,"The chapters about work and money were helpful, but all the examples of ""simple living"" were too impractical for most people. While the definition of voluntary simplicity is alleged fluid, why give the most extreme examples of people building adobe houses without indoor plumbing? The author talked too much about spirituality and quasi-religious matters. Just stick to the hints, please."
3,"Intelligent, informative, flexible, soul-searching.","Unlike what other readers have described, Luhr's book is not extremist: in fact, the author gives numerous examples of others who use some basic strategies of Simple Living who are not on the lower scale of income. It seems that the point of the book has been missed for those readers. Rather, Luhr makes us ask ourselves a difficult question: what really IS important to you in life? No answer is definitely given. Instead, Luhr gives us a path in which to explore its possibilities, and the rich and spiritual depths of our own inner nature."
4,We are sitll waiting for our Funnel Cake Kit,"It's a little late, but we still have our hopes up for recieving the kit. From The description of the funnel cake kit, Both my wife and I believe the kit is well worth waiting for."
5,Funnel cakes yummy,"I recently did a search for this item on Amazon and I was disappointed to say the least when it was out of stock. I ended up going tp an auction website and I won it for about 20.00, this includes shipping. It's a great product and there is a demand for it.Too bad Amazon doesn't have anymore. I will check back periodically to see if they have it available. It makes a great gift."
2,Poor quality,"Received this bag as a gift. I love all the pockets and the design of the bag, but the quality is very poor and the outside of the bag started to look very worn very quickly."
2,not satisfied,After only 1 month of use the purse fell apart the material just crumbled off always had it all over my clothes and I couldnt understand why I was very careful with it and I actually had to buy me a new diaper bag needless to say i will not be purchasing anything else from this seller
1,DVD Gold seems better than it is.,"I have owned an HK DVD player for a few years now and I have been following DTS audio for a while. I got this DVD based on good reviews I have heard. After recieving the DVD, I found that it was not quite what I expected. There were a few DTS tracks that were ok. But overall I was disippointed in the DVD because I felt that it did not even come close to utilizing the potential of DTS. It is chock full of ""Nature"" videos (samples) that played music over video...while put together well, it lacked the sound I was after. There is a Blue Angels section that I went right to when I got the DVD thinking there would be some great sound fields involved....alas, it was a well shot video with nothing but music playing in the background.Bottom line, if you want to push your system into doing what it is capable of, this DVD will not impress you."
3,Could be better...,"Nik Okuntseff explains the API well, however he should have left out the code to his C++ classes which takes up a good 35% of the book. Would have received 4 stars if he used plain easy-to-read 15 line or less example code."
3,Good for those new to the security API,"This is probably the best book out there (well, actually, the ONLY book out there) for learing the basics of the NT security API -- however, its coverage is less than complete to say the least. For instance, it barely even mentions LSA!"
3,For programmers only.,Even though I read the synopsis of this book I was still surprised to find that the subject covers Windows NT and C language security conventions and not really very much about securing Windows NT.
1,I'd give it ZERO stars if I could,"I bought three packs of these disks. They are very cute and have vinal on the front. They play beautifully - that is, if you can burn them! I had to throw out over half of them because they would not burn properly - you could see the defects on the disks. Amazon sent me replacements but I had to throw half of those away as well. Don't waste your money."
5,Cinderella Cookie Jar,The cookie jar has wonderful detailing. I hope the person I purchased for will like it as well as I. I did feel it was a little expensive but what is not today? The colors are beautiful. It was a good purchase.
1,Nothing special,"BeethovenPiano Sonata no. 16 in G majorPiano Sonata no. 17 in D minor ""The Tempest""Piano Sonata no. 18 in E flat majorPaul Lewis, pianoEnregistrement avril 2005harmonia mundi s. a.Generally speaking, he translates the original scores faithfully and plays them well. But nothing special."
5,"A classic, not to be overlooked","How sad that only this, Volume 1, of the the Soul Shots series remains in print. This is an absolutely essential collection, even if you already have some of the songs in your collection. The selection, sequencing and particularly the sound are superb. Also worth noting, most of these are in stereo. Back when this was released, in 1988, stereo was still the preferable format, unlike the current trend which is to issue the way the original singles were released, i.e., mono. Regardless of that, I'll take the stereo versions anyday, even with the extreme separation.This is a classic collection of 60s soul. So are volumes two, three and four, though they have sadly been discontinued. If you find any of them used, do yourself a favor and buy them."
4,Mikrokosmos,"This is a collector's item. Mikrokosmos performed by Gyorgy Sandor, Bela Bartok's pupil, recorded through 1955. Received in sealed package, in excellent condition. CD Played perfectly. Thankyou."
3,Three stars only because the book is out of print and could use a revision.,"Straightforward discussion of managing business change -- but focuses on the role of the leaders to manage the change -- would have been good to give more attention to the fact that leaders don't really know what they are doing (especially when it is not a planned re-org, but a forced downsizing), and stress we are all responsible for managing change in the workplace. Good intro discussion of the emotional and psychological aspects of business change, which I am sadly witnessing every day at my own job."
4,Heard great things...,"I've heard great things about the book. It was purchased for an upcoming class, but haven't had a moment to peruse it yet."
5,Fantastic!,"Brilliant, terrific, amazing, hilarious! Eric Idle and Neil Innes are a great team. It doesn't get any funnier than this!"
4,Rutlemaniacs Rejoice!,"If you enjoyed the 1978 television satire ""All You Need Is Cash,"" this CD soundtrack is an absolute must. Terrific Beatle parodies abound - ""Hold My Hand,"" ""Doubleback Alley,"" ""Get Up and Go,"" ""Love Life"" and the immortal ""Cheese and Onions."" In the brief history of mock bands, The Rutles were among the best. Even George Harrison was a fan."
5,"""All You Need is Cash""","Twenty tracks of expertly manufactured Beatle-esque pop songs, sounding quite uncannily like the real thing. The soundtrack accompanies the great mockumentary of the same name. Not as well known as ""This is Spinal Tap"", but worthy of just about as much acclaim. So who are boys in the band? Why Dirk (Eric Idle), Nasty, Stig, and Barry. The cast includes members of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Simon & Garfunkel, Monty Python's Flying Circus, and Saturday Night Live. Composed by Neil Innes (The Bonzo Dog Band) and executive produced by SNL's Lorne Michaels."
2,It's some of the most ridiculous songs ever,"I found this in a bargin bin in December of 84. I found it for the most part a big steaming pile of shaving cream. Don't forget this is a family webpage. There was some demented genius here with ""Good Times Roll"" where they play to the tune of ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"", There is also ""Cheese and Onions"" not a good mix. ""Hold My Hand"" which is to the tune of ""All My Loving"" qualifies as a competent love song, and ""Piggy In The Middle"" was done to the tune of ""I Am The Walrus"", but to me should've been released this year as these are songs that would probably be big hits right now as Rock and Roll is truly dead."
3,"A little bit dated, but still a decent book.",This book is from 1946 but it is worth the read. The author is an Englishman. Better than a lot of gin books out there.
2,Totally agree with previous reviewer.,"It's been a couple of months now since I got it. It looks pretty nice, but it ""doesn't breath"" at all so no matter what you wearing underneath it - you'll sweat. If I knew it before - I would never buy it."
3,A good product. Could allow for more air circulation thought.,"This product delivers as promissed when it comes to the design and durability. However, it ""doesn't breath"" at all which in case of continuous activity makes you feel a lot like rice in a steamer."
2,Glad I only paid the clearance price,"If I could have tried this on before purchase, I NEVER would have bought it.The jacket is made with some nice materials. The outter shell is water-proof but as other reviewers have stated, it does not breath well and can become too warm. The zippers are not sewn together well and are sometimes difficult to zip. They frequently bind with the fabric along the zipper. The velcro on the cuffs is also sewn on very poorly. It isn't straight and chaffes my wrists.The removable inner jacket is made of very plush fleece and is comfortable and warm.It was worth the clearance price but not the full price."
1,USELESS!!!!,"What a fantastic idea!! What a complete letdown. The pulsating light is nice; kind of relaxing. I love how small and portable it is. I could not get this thing to work with any radio, especially my car. I live in a metro area, very few available channels. The sound quality was horrible, even after adjusting the setting like the manual recommends. My car antenna is in my back window, I don't know if that made it worse, but it sounds like constant static and even when you can hear the music it is pretty bad sound quality like it's coming from the other side of a tunnel. Don't waste your money. SONY PEEPS: (If you're reading -) REVAMP THIS THING!!! IT COULD BE THE COOLEST LITTLE GADGET EVER!"
1,POS,"Didn't work at all. I live in Chicago, so there aren't too many available stations and it doesn't work at all. The only hope for this thing is in rural areas."
2,POO!!,This thing is a freakkin rip off. probably the weakest fm transmitter known to man. Also it drains your battery in under two hours. a very poor design and ultimately useless for anyone living in a moderate to large sized city.
3,Handy reference material for non-fiction writers,"Packed with practical suggestions for breaking out of your 'stuck' state and finding the writing techniques that'll help to get your words flowing again.Some of the language is a little dry - like the repeated reference to your writing ""thesis"" when ""point"" or ""focus"" might have done just as well - and it's clearly designed as a reference guide rather than a book you could read straight through.That being said there's a positive and helpful emphasis on experimenting and yes trouble-shooting: pinpointing what you're getting stuck on, and looking for a writing technique that'll work for you."
1,not happy,"i was not happy with this item because when i ordered this item the first time i got the pink version of the pez, then when i ordered it agian thinking i would get the camo pez i got the pink one again."
5,very nice for kids,i bought this for my birthay kids last year...they love it! Afonso is crazy with tyrannosaurus rex and it is really funny to see him and her sister eatinfg this!
2,Disappointed,"i ordered this and it got here ontime but i am disappointed. first i opened the package and the nail gel was not even in its box. Then when i opened the nail gel it looks like its been used. it already has hardend gel around the rim. Then i went to go put the cap back on and it doesnt shut properly. i do nt want to pay to ship it back on somthing this little so i am keeping it and going to try it as is. Everything i order on Amazon never comes great, but when i pay the extra money and get i off its original websit it comes outstanding."
2,Packaging not as shown,"The product works fine, but is comes in a different package than shown. Rather than a bottle that you can use 1-2 drops at a time it comes in individual plastic vials. If you happen to have just a single lens its a horrible waste. The directions say to use 2 drops in a very full contact case, but you know 1 drop in a 1/2 full case works just fine too... In this case there are about 6 drops in each package. Its a huge waste of packaging optimized for the profit of the manufacturer."
2,Not the big bottle!,"Even though I read all the reviews before purchasing this item, I guess I didn't understand what B.Allison had written (in hindsight, though, her review is absolutely correct). I was looking for the big bottle of liquid enzymatic cleaner so that I could use as much or little as I wanted. The picture with this product link shows the old packaging of that big bottle but they send you the 12 individual dispensers - which you can find for cheaper in your local drug store and avoid the shipping cost. I can still use this product but now it cost me more than I expected. Bausch & Lomb is just trying to make more money with this change in their product packaging. Way disappointed."
4,almost as good as it used to be,"This product is easily the best way to enzyme your rigid-gas-permeable contact lenses. The individual dispensers, with just enough for one application in each, are helpful in avoiding waste. It's too bad the package doesn't include a storage case for lenses as it used to, but oh well. Despite that quibble, this is the best product of its type on the market."
5,"Outstanding Sinatra live, stunning DVD 5.1 sound!","This classic collaboration between Sinatra and Count Basie in Las Vegas is a definitive portrait of two consummate artist in an exciting ""live"" environment. It captures the full gamut of the ""swinging"" Frank of the classic ""Fly Me To the Moon"" and ""My Kind of Town"" as well as the ""poignant"" Sinatra of ""Angel Eyes"" and ""September of My Years."" Basie and his orchestra are tight, swinging and dynamic, a joy to listen to. Ok, some of the short patter may be a bit dated and insensitive, but the overall performance is one for the ages, with Sinatra being in excellent voice. My biggest regret is that I wasn't there. Oh, and the fact that this DVD is out of print and going for ripoff prices on the used market. The recording engineers outdid themselves on this one, so if you can grab it at a decent price, go for it, you won't regret it! I use it as a showcase for my audio system."
3,A lot of fluff,"Half the book is comprised of lists of airlines, car rentals, hotels, tour operators, tourism offices, etc. Perhaps useful, but that information is available elsewhere. I didn't view these lists as essential to running a group tour business. I'm not sure how accurate all of the information is; for example, he spends quite some time talking about GLAMER, the Group Leaders of America, yet doesn't mention that this group is for senior travel only. He also says that GLAMER membership is free (implying to anyone), yet the GLAMER site requires that you have already organized a group tour before being qualified to join.His model is a realtively narrow one, assuming that you will draw your clientele from the same geographic region, your club, church, etc. I would have liked to have seen other examples of tour groups, e.g., cultural or arts tours drawing clientele from all over the country or world.An easy read; I was through the book in a couple of hours."
3,I am the author,I wrote this book for all the Lewis funs as well as all those seriously studying on Lewis. I welcome any comment or criticism as well as your views on this book or on Lewis. The numbers of stars that I submit is temporarily. I wish it would be 4 or 5 stars for some.
3,I DO NOT RECOMMEND,"THIS IS A REALLY COOL TOY THE FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES YOU HIT IT. MY 2 YEAR OLD, HIT IT WITH THE HAMMER...LIKE IT IS INTENDED, AND IT BROKE THE 3RD TIME HE HIT IT. THE RED TOP FLEW RIGHT OFF. ITS NOT MUCH GOOD WITHOUT THAT. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED."
1,Disappointed,"This book was a waste of money.I expected guidance on everyday problems however it just highlights problems but does not offer solutions. In addition, it barely scratches the surface. Overall, a major disappointment."
4,exactly what I expected,"Exactly what I expected it to be. Perfect size for my 1 1\2 year old to reach her t.v. Since she isn't a climber and very delicate with her things, this was in fact perfect for her. Everything in her room is miniature sized so this table fits in perfectly, and not bad for the price. Also it was a quick and easy build. Would I recommend for 4 and up? No. As it'd be too small. Also would not recommend for rougher children, as I could see it breaking if too much weight was put on it. Shipping was fast. And I was very happy with my purchase."
2,TOO SMALL!!,"Okay, I know this is a 'toddler' table but come on! This thing is useless and way too small. I should have been more diligent in checking the size dimentions....returning it. This should have been a $20 item - not $42!!!!!"
4,Sturdy!,"Although this table arrived damaged... Kidkraft took care of it right away. My daughter loves this tiny table. She's 14 months and enjoys having a table her size for her sippy... And to climb on :) It is a very sturdy, well made table. Assembly was very easy and quick. The only bad thing for me was the drawer. I purchased the table loving the idea that it had a drawer my daughter could have fun with. The drawer takes quite a bit of effort to pull out and she isn't strong enough to use it. Overall, terrific table!"
5,Cute Litle Side Table!,T his looks great in our sons nursery and it will match the Kidkraft boat bed we purchased well! all in all well worth the money and a must have for a nursery/toddler's room!
4,"Good, durable, kiddie furniture","My child can be hard on furniture, but this is holding up just fine. The finish is durable and can withstand multiple cleanings to remove crayon, marker, etc.The construction is standard for kiddie furniture, which is to say: cardboard bubble pack o' allen bolts and a miniature allen wrench.Save yourself some aggravation and buy a ratcheting allen wrench or ratcheting screwdriver that you can fit allen heads on. The only problem you will have at that point is being mindful to NOT over tighten(a problem even with the tiny little wrench included).With my trusty ratcheting screwdriver I had this thing put together in about 15 minutes, with a 2 year old 'helper' hiding bolts."
4,short but cute,"Some of the screws wouldn't go all the way in, but they don't stick out enough to scratch my daugher. The screws are in the back so you can't see them either. It is definetly at toddler table. It is very short, but it is really cute. It is pretty sturdy for as light as it is. Not a bad buy."
1,TINY,"So i missed the part of the specs where it said it was 14 inches tall. I was shocked when I started to put it together considering my daughter is going to have a queen size bed :) But I sent it back and was refunded in no time.Just want to make it very clear that it is meant to go next to a toddler bed, it's not just a toddler nightstand :) My bad."
2,"DVD - ""This Christmas""","Purchased from Street_Lights a DVD ""This Christmas"" by Donny Hathaway. Over priced for two songs for the purchase price of $25.38. I feel that there should have been more songs on the DVD for the price. Rip-off.Laura J. Caliman"
1,Can you say repetitive?,"I am quite disappointed in this CD. I figured there would be a little different type of songs than I had heard on her newest CDs. Unfortunately, I was wrong. It's all the same stuff. Oh well, she's popular, that's all that matters."
2,DULL! BORING in SOME PLACES!,"There are some good songs on this album, but the pace of the album is BORING and DULL! There are like five ballads back to back which make you fall to sleep. Beauty and the Beast, If You Asked me To and the funky Love Can Move Mountains (in its full five minutes here!) are all great, but the other songs have too much aftertaste. Only on the later efforts Falling Into You and Let's Talk About Love did she get better in assembling albums and getting them right. But this album has a blandness that just drags and doesn't keep you alert. You'd run off the road on a flat interstate highway in Kansas if you'd hear this on a CD car stereo. Just too dull! Sorry, Celine!"
1,not worth a cent,i certainly hope that i have not bought this album... and it proves to me i have made a big mistake
1,corny and meaningless,"her songs r turning stale and sour to me! this album too, her songs r loads of hogwashed and she is sure deproving ...come on celine, sure u can do better than this!"
3,Her 2nd album...not as good as her first,"This album is where Celine found her groove: slow songs. Her pervious album ""Unison"" had many many more upbeat songs. The two big standout hits on this CD are ""Love Can Move Mountains"" and ""Beauty And The Beast""."
1,worst singer in this decade,"celine come on, pls show us the true powers in u...u shouldn't be producing something like that! do it for all to see! do it for britney spears to see, and coco lee is coming after u! trash her!"
3,Stop the nasty comments,"For all of you that are providing bad reviews of this album here is a little note...y'all who are saying that ""her most glorious days are over"" and ""Beauty and the Beast AGain!"" please take note of the release date of this album...it is 1992. This album was released before most of her famous works were released; therefore making your comments unfair and not worthy of publication on this site. Please discontinue these nasty comments unless you have a sensible argument for your case. Thank You."
5,Excellent Album,"The last track on this album, ""Nothing Broken But My Heart"" was a minor hit (in comparison with her later hit singles) but the gentle insistance and quietly-aching vocal portrayed in this song is a far stretch from her later, over-dramatic ballad singing. If you want to hear Celine Dion in a refreshingly understated way, this is the album to get, and ""Nothing Broken But My Heart"" is the song to program into your CD player's ""repeat"" function."
5,Celine is the best!!,"I have almost all of you albums. I love it all. My favorite is ""Halfway to Heaven"" you duet with Kenny G. Keep the hits coming. Thanks"
4,Good! Great! Grand!,"Great in every way. Though some songs don't fit in (""Show Some Emotion"", ""A Little Bit of Love"", and ""With This Tear"") this album still carries on. Best tracks: 1,3,5-9,11,13."
5,Strong set of songs,"Celine's second english album is truly a great album, start to finish. It opens with an introduction of her singing french, then onto the big hit, the inspirational ""Love Can Move Mountains"". It's one of 5 songs Diane Warren contributed to the project. ""Show Some Emotion"" is classic Celine. Then there is Celine's rendition of the Patti Labelle original ""If You Asked Me To"", I enjoy both versions, another Diane Warren song. Celine really shines on the ballads, like ""I Love You, Goodbye"", ""Water From The Moon"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" (with Peabo Bryson), ""With This Tear"" (written by Prince) and to me the best ballad, ""Nothing Broken But My Heart"". There's also a few uptempos like ""Little Bit Of Love"" or ""Did You Give Enough Love"". The album features a variety of producers, such as John Doelp, Vito Luprano, Ric Wake, Walter Afansieff, Humberto Gatica, Guy Roche, and Richard Zuckerman. You can't miss with this album. A must have."
5,I really Enjoy This,I enjoy this CD. I love the hits of Power of Love especially and I do like most of the other tunes.
2,music,"I love Celine Dion, but the songs she sang on that cd were not to my liking. She is a wonderful entertainer, those songs weren't the best.I will order more of her cd's.I will go ahead & keep this cd. Lynette Sauls"
4,Great cd!,"This is a real good cd. She's an amazing singer. The two songs that I love are ""If you Asked Me to"" and ""I love you, goodbye."" Celine Dion has a great voice in this cd."
5,A terrific album!,This is personally my favorite Celine Dion album. You gotta listen to it to know what I mean!
5,"Slight departure, but satisfying all the same","Bitch veers away from the dynamic and sometimes over-the-top style of her previous act, Bitch and Animal, to create a thoughtful but powerful album with Make This/Break This. She showcases her multiple musical talents and threads excellent storytelling throughout the songs. Fans of the raucous and rousing previous releases may be disappointed with the more mellow vibe, but Make This/Break This is a gem on its own."
5,Dining with Frank Lloyd Wright,"""Frank Lloyd Wright's Dining Rooms,"" by Carla Lind, is one of a series of ""mini-books,"" each of which spotlights a particular facet of Wright's amazing career. This volume contains many excellent full color photographs of dining rooms and furniture designed by the master architect. Other useful features in the book are Lind's interesting text, a series of sidebar quotes from Wright and others, and a bibliography.Lind describes how Wright's dining rooms, over the course of his career, mirrored societal changes. Houses pictured in the book include the Rosenbaum house, Taliesin West, Fallingwater, and others. Each photo demonstrates Wright's mastery of color, space, form, and light. If you are interested in the work of Wright or in home design in general, you might really enjoy this book."
3,not up to the original rotozip standard,"it looks like a dremel flex shaft... it is a dremel flex shaft. sadly it does not have neat features of the original rotozips. ie no built in storage for the wrench or drivenut, no remote trigger on the pen to start/stop the rotozip. Aside from that it does its primary task well. Oh yeah, stupid bosch - it works w/ rebel, revolution, pro series classic, scs01 and rtm01.Includes: 1 flex-shaft assembly (36"" long), 1 drivenut, 1 std RZ wrench, 1 flex-shaft wrench, 1/8"" collet, 1 collet nut, 1 mandrel(402) & 6 cutoff wheels(426), 1 drum & 6 sander bands(407), 2 highspeed cutters/engravers(91/194), 2 Si carbide grinding stones(84922/85602), 2 Al oxide grinding stones(932/8193) and 1/8"" drill bit."
3,So-so: Limited Applicability & Usability,Doesn't take standard size X-bits (5/32 inch) - so couldn't use the bit I needed. Doesn't flex enough. Made an odd grinding noise one time. It works but I wasn't very happy with it.
2,gets too hot,"I used it to shape a 2x4 into an armrest for my truck door. Using the flex shaft continuosly made it very hot in the handle so I had to wear gloves. Also, later I was wearing latex gloves and the cutting saw blade caught the glove. I quickly shut off the power but the glove got tangled up and I got cut. I later found out that the 2 seconds it took to turn off the power still was enough to snap the shaft at the roto zip end. Even though I was using it for light duty cutting plastic, it could not stand up to momentary stress."
3,Fair,"Delivered on time, in good condition and was as described. Product had some cutting and sanding bits in it also........very noisy and flex shaft gets hot. You cant bend too much also, but it is workable if you have roto zip machine already."
1,Instant Fail,"Purchased this item a while back and did not use it till this past weekend.1. Read instructions2. Installed shaft as described in instructions3. Plugged RotoZip in4. Turned it on to test it...5. Nothing... but smoke coming from the connection between the rotozip and the flexshaft. Melting plastic smell too.I unplugged and took the shaft off the RotoZip. No matter how I tried to spin the business end of the flex shaft... it spun freely without connecting to the inner flex shaft. Reinstalled it several times on the rotozip but the business end never ""engaged""... and the connection between the shaft and the Rotozip would just smoke.Totally out of luck now... since there is no Warranty.** DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT **"
1,Disapppointing,"I port and polish cylinder heads which require smaller-than-usual tools. I have broken 2 FS2 flex shafts, and am now looking at picking up either a pneumatic pencil-style die grinder, or remote grinder with repairable/replaceable flex shaft."
1,it fell apart and there is no warranty on it,I purchased it to make textures on wooden bowls. After two weeks of very little use it fell apart. It would not stay attatched to the rotozip and it just came apart.I found out there is no warranty so it is now in the trash. What a waste of money. I would not suggest yu buy one.
5,Rotozip flexshaft,This was a replacement to one which has lasted me about 4 years. Worth the money for the small jobs.
5,A trip down memory lane with true classic,"It was the summer before my freshman year of college when this album was released. I remember seeing most of these bands at Lollapalooza that same summer and understanding good and well that it was a special time for American music (also see Beastie Boys, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Sonic Youth, Pavement, among others). This soundtrack (and movie) capture that time and place like no other. This compilation is historically signifigant, to be sure, but the music is stellar also, exemplars of the artists' impressive catalogues."
4,Best Movie Soundtrack?,"This could possibly be the best movie soundtrack ever. With multiple tracks from Chris Cornell and, Pearl Jam and, apperances from other artists like Alice In Chains and, Jimi Hendrix, How can you go wrong? Every SINGLES track is more than listenable."
3,Long Gone Day,"A great selection that reflects the days of the early 90's... I put 3 stars only because there's some great songs mising from the film, like Dig For Fire (Pixies) or Three Days. (Jane's Addiction) Yes, after all these years, I still like ""the seattle sound"" Am I the only one who remembers that summer??"
3,God smiles on the Smashing Pumpkins,"There are several great songs on here, including the one by Alice In Chains, and the two by Pearl Jam. The reason I got this cd, though, is for the Smashing Pumpkins' ""Drown."" It's 8 minutes long, and the last 3 minutes are a screechy distorted guitar doodling, but the song seems to pass in a few seconds. A dEfinate must for any Pumpkins or Pearl Jam fan."
5,Best Soundtrack of the 90s,"This is easily the best movie soundtrack of the 90s (ok, Pulp Fiction Sndtrck. was good too), and I would argue that it is one of the best cds of the 90s. It captures the early 90s Seattle/grunge scene perfectly. The two Pearl Jam songs on here are terrific, and I really enjoy the Paul Westerberg tunes as well. The Smashing Pumpkins gorgeous heart-wrenching track ""Drown"" is also a highlight."
3,Singles: Origional Motion Picture Soundtrack,"This is a great CD, however, it was advertised as, ""like new"" and one of the songs does not play. The CD skips."
3,"Sip my Latte, Seattle","The movie Singles epitomizes everything wrong with trendy elitist Seattle. If this movie had been set in Nebraska, it wouldn't have caught on. But since Seattle is the Heroin capital of the country, then it's the perfet place to feature a few go-nowhere-fast kids who unsure of their future and where their next kanoodle will come from.There are more imporant movie in life to see than this. And there are certainly better soundtracks to buy."
4,Important sampler,"Still stands as one of the only first-gen alternative compilations of significance, catering to all the different flavors a bustling 90's Seattle offered."
3,A Good Bargain For Your Buck,"This is my first experience with Bierce's works, and I thought this book was pretty good for it's price. I really didn't think that any of these stories were scary or horrifying in any way, but some of them were interesting. I thought that some of the longer tales resembled Poe's with the sometimes unwanted droning of needless descriptive and large words. But, I would reccomend this book if you are a fan of Poe. I thought this book was a good bargain, since it is cheaper than a cup of coffee these days. So, I encourage you to take a look at it. It's a pretty good read, and what else can you buy for this price today?"
3,"Cute, but...","Nice collection, but I've heard many of the songs on other albums (which I already have)."
1,A sad CD,"I honestly bought this CD for one song and that was ""all I want for x-mas is a hippotamus"". I love that song and Alvin and the Chipmunks. For me the rest of the songs sucked and they arent worth anything to me. But I couldnt find the song I wanted as a single at the time. Just make sure that you read the songs included list before you buy."
4,Hippo,"I wanted the song ""I want a Hippopotamus for Christmas"" and the song IS on this CD ... except for one or two other songs ... the rest of the songs are pretty unusual (some i had never heard before) ... but I just wanted the one song so I am very happy with the CD,"
5,Demented Holiday Fun,"Every Christmas season, it's wonderful to enjoy the music that forms the backdrop for the holiday. However, the season, which used to be a couple weeks long, is now a couple months long; some radio stations start playing Christmas music when the Christmas decorations appear in the stores, right after Halloween. At some point, even the holiday music of Bing Crosby, Christina Aguilera, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and all the rest of the Christmas ""standard"" songs grow a bit stale. Dr. Demento provides a refreshing and hilarious alternative with this package. There are other, similar packages; I know because I have a few. But this is the best. I recommend it for the CD collection of anybody who has a sense of humor and celebrates Christmas, or anybody who just has a sense of humor."
4,funny memories from the past,"I needed to find a certain song for my daughter for Christmas, little did I know that all these songs,from when I was young,were going to be on the cd! It was great to listen and laugh with her while listening to most of them. There were only a couple I didn't care for, but we just didn't listen to them, ie: Ground Zero."
3,Some great songs and some irritating ones,"I love that this CD has some of the Christmas songs that I love, but it also has some really annoying songs on it. I guess everyone likes different things."
3,"Something for everyone, but it's hard to like them all.","Collections like these are always interesting. Humor is subjective so odds are what appeals to some won't appeal to others. Contributions by clever performers like Tom Lehrer and Stan Freeberg are mixed with ""Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer"" and ""I Yust Go Nuts at Christmas,""creating quite a mixed bag. From the Singing Dogs to Allen Sherman is quite a leap, but fans of the ""fun"" side of Christmas music should be satisfied."
4,Delightful and Quirky,"I used to have a copy of this but it was ruined so I wanted another copy. This is a delightful cd and I enjoy many of the songs, although my main reason for purchasing it was for the I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas song."
5,"Cheech and Chog's ""Santa and His Old Lady"" Is On This Album","I purchased this item on Amazon for the Cheech and Chog story about Santa Claus. It arrived on time as scheduled, and it arrived in good condition as promised. Love it!"
5,Shake up the Christmas mix a little,"This is a very funny and enjoyable collection of Christmas insanity. Especially good for old timers like me who still have fond memories of the Zanies of Christmas Past, like Stan Freberg and Spike Jones. I bought this collection mainly for my favorite Christmas song: ""I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas"", but the rest of the songs have kept me laughing along this Christmas, too. Having downloaded this album into my iTunes along with about 20 hours of traditional Christmas music, all I have to do is click ""shuffle play"" and one of these ditties will provide a nice little humor break between the many renditions of ""Silent Night"" and ""Adeste Fidelis"". Highly recommended to anyone looking for some Christmas chuckles."
5,A family favorite,"This CD is a family favorite. My kids love to sing along to it, particulary the Hippopotamus song (which is very difficult to find). Although I originally bought this CD for that one song, we have found the entire disk highly enjoyable."
3,Listen to before you let children have it,"I bought this because it was the only place I could find the song ""I want a hippopotamus for christmas"". I'm glad I listened to it before giving it to my daughter because some of the songs on it are not appropriate for young children. I burnt off the ones she could listen to and put this one away."
4,"Ready, Set, Go","Bought at long distance (from UK) for our grandson (in USA) for his first birthday. Listened to him (and his Dad) playing with them with gusto and lots of laughter. Several weeks later they are still being played with and have proved durable. Highly recommended, even though we have yet to see them!"
5,These are SO much fun!,"We have these in our church nursery and they are really fun cars! When I work in there I play with them with the little ones and we race them. They work great on the carpet there, although it is very thin and flat. I liked them so much that I bought some recently for my daughter (4) and son (11 months) and we do the same thing with them at home on the tile - race them. My son loves crawling after them and trying to get them to ""go"" on his own. He also loves banging them around and they've held up really good. They are soft rubber material so he can chew on them too. Fun, fun, fun!"
2,Not sure why these got rated so high.,"My 1 year old got these for Christmas and they have already stopped going forward and they certainly go nowhere on carpet. They also feel really cheap, but strangely they were not cheap. Granted, he has pulled them back a few times in the last week and he has done the typical one year old banging, but what kid doesn't do this to toys, and what kind of company doesn't make toys to withstand this type of playing. I'd say if your kid is past the banging, abusing toys phase and you have only hard wood floors in your home, then these are the cars for you, but if not check out K's cars. He also got those for Christmas, and those are much better quality."
3,doesn't work on all carpet.,"I was so excited to think that they would work on our carpet, but they didn't. And now one of them isn't working at all. My little one still likes them, but not as much as I had hoped."
3,Not Bad,"Disclaimer: I'm not a big fan of Ray Charles' style of music, so maybe I shouldn't even be reviewing this album. However, I bought it basically for his classic version of ""America, the Beautiful""; I have been unable to find a single of that song anywhere. The CD also has the classics ""Hit the Road, Jack"" and ""Georgia on My Mind"", which made the CD worth getting. I didn't particularly like most of the rest of the album (again, I'm not a huge fan), except that I was pleasantly surprised with ""I Can't Stop Loving You"". I hadn't heard this song before, and I really enjoyed it."
4,"Not complete, but a good selection","This record doesn't have all of Ray's greatest hits, but it does have most of them. If you're looking for the early songs he released on Atlantic, you won't find them. But most of the songs you heard on the radio in the 1950's and 1960's are here. There are even a few songs from live album releases which are refreshing changes from the standards. If you're looking for an encyclopedic collection of Ray's works, you have other choices. If you want a one-disk collection which will keep you humming and singing along, this is a good start."
5,Anthology,Wonderful! A must have for any fan of Ray Charles... Also a great gift forsomeone that hasn't followed his music.
2,Good if you're interested in textiles,"If you are purely interested in the lives, origins and other facts on the mummies you will be disappointed and find yourself doing a lot of skim reading. Barber is a textiles expert and this is the main focus of the book. If you are interested in how the mummies lived I would rate this book a 2, if you are interested in what they wore and how it was made and how this relates to their origins then it's probably a 4 - some nice photos though...."
1,Fluff,"It is beutiful to look at, but it contains very little actual information and lots of uninformed, poorly thought out speculation."
3,A good set of tales to pass some time.,"I have read many Colin Wilson books over the years and, although entertaining and well written. However, Wilson's personal vendetta against ""science"" continues to make him accept pretty much anything and come over as quite naive. He continues to hold to the Bermuda Triangle mystery even though its been mainly debunked and blown out of the water as an old mariner's tale of modern times.Still, Wilson's writings make an entertaining read and can be thought provoking at times. He trully believes that we should push our belief systems and minds to the limit, and I agree with him on this. I think he could use a good dose of skepticism sometimes, but at least he can make you think that maybe anything is possible."
4,Interesting read but how much is really true.,"I enjoyed reading this but everything ""Sammy the Bull"" says is said in a way to either boost his ego or make himself look great. He was greedy and selfish and a cold blooded killer. He killed his brother-in-law ferchrissakes! All the family had left to bury was a hand. He kept killing off more and more and taking over their business ventures. He really got off easy in the end but then F'd it all up in an Arizona drug ring."
5,"Sammy ""The Bull""","Peter Maas helps the Ex-Mafia Underboss to tell his side of the story.And of his life in good detail.The mass murderer truned rat tells it all with no remorse.Of how he got started in the mafia.Why he got his nickname ""The Bull"".And how he first met the ""Dapper Don""."
3,Underboss a fun romp through Mafia life.,"I have to admit. I know nothing about the Mafia and have never been a fan of Gangster novels.When a friend of mine handed me this novel, I took one look at the cover and figured what the heck, I'll try it out (I had just seen Serpico late one night recently, and on the cover it said Peter Maas...author of Serpico).This was a good read. At least for me, who knew nothing about Mafia life or anything about Sammy Gravano or any of his associates. While some chapters were dry, it was really interesting to see how the mob did business in New York and across the country.I would recommend this novel to anyone who has an interest in reading about life in the mafia, or even someone that likes to read biographies."
4,the bull,"book is very good in detailing La Costra Nostra in NYC during early 70""s. mostly 80's- enjoyed it."
5,GRAVANO IS NO RAT,"I WORK AT A BOOKSTORE AND I AM ALWAYS LOOKING FOR GOOD NON-FICTION BOOKS, PARTICULARLY MAFIA-RELATED BOOK AND I HAVE READ AND RECOMEND SUCH BOOKS AS ""GOTTI"" BY JERRY CAPECCI AND ""GOOMBATA"" BY JOHN CUMMINGS, BUT AS SOON AS THIS BOOK ARRIVED IN MY STORE I KNEW I HAD TO READ IT BECAUSE IT TOLD THE STORY FROM THE SIDE THAT NOBODY WANTED OR EXPECTED TO HEAR FROM. THE WAY THE BOOK IS WRITTEN KEPT ME TURNING THE PAGES NON-STOP. I ADMIRE SAMMY GRAVANO FOR WHAT HE DID KNOWING WHAT THE CONSECUENCES OF HIS ACTIONS WERE .PETER MAAS WAS VERY PRIVILEGED TO WORK WITH SUCH HONEST MAN AS MR. GRAVANO."
1,RAT,"This is a story that was told by a man who was a sell out just to save his own skin. He told the FBI anything and everything that they wanted to hear. This book tells the tale of mafia life from a person on the inside, but who is to say that the information that is being given is the truth. The book reads well and seems interesting and exciting for those who do not know what mob life is really like. The book is filled with false facts and incorrect information. It seems odd to me that people are supporting a man that has admitted to nineteen murders."
2,The same old story,"I felt this book offered nothing new to the Mafia story that hasn't been published in better books like ""Wiseguy"" by Pilleggi. Maas strains to make Gravano ""sympathetic,"" but really he's just pathetic, as are Gotti and, for that matter, Peter Mass, for pedaling the same old song thirty years after he first published ""Valachi Papers."""
2,Cacophonous Rant,"Perhaps the publisher or Peter Maas was trying to do something new to appeal to the public. By selectively editing interviews this book is written in the prose of Sammy the Bull's slang and jargon, fragmented sentences, non-sequiturs, and poor train of thought. I didn't finish the book. To all others, in my humble opinion it's not worth starting."
4,I read it in one sitting.,"I was looking through my local library's book sale when I found a copy of this book. I read a few pages, but decided not to buy the book because it was damaged. I checked a copy out instead. I finished it later that evening. I don't usually enjoy a book enough to read it in one sitting, but this book kept my attention throughout. I can't say it was the best book I've ever read, but I definitely enjoyed it. Its portrayal of Sammy ""The Bull"" Gravano was a little too positive for my taste, and too little time was spent explaining the rise of John Gotti to power. Regardless, this book is worth reading."
1,A Lot of Sammy's Bull,"Peter Maas is a very skilled writer, and has produced some excellent work. However, this work is hampered by Mr. Gravano's largely self-serving slant on everything. He attempts to convince the reader that he is essentially a nice fellow who just happens to have killed nineteen people along the way. As a reward for his testimony against John Gotti and several others, Gravano served just three years in prison. While those against whom he testified may have been reprehensible characters, one has to take into serious question Gravano's motivation for doing so. Similarly, his motivation in producing this book must also be questioned. Although there are a few interesting elements, this appears to be little more than an effort to cash in on his notoriety, one more heist (albeit a legal one, for a change). Little Sammy - Lots of Bull!"
4,Sammy's Bull,"I can't help but imagine that Sammy the Bull tends to embellish his stories a bit. But Peter Maas makes up for it with his fine writing. All in all, a good book, exciting, and easy to read."
5,Most tantalizing mafia book ever written.,"The true, but depressing life of a real world wise guy. This book points out that there are no winners in a life of crime. Gravano holds nothing back when telling his life story as one of the most prominent modern day mobsters. You will not be able to put this book down. It is so well written that you will feel like you are watching a motion picture.Peter Maas has a special way of keeping you at the edge of the story at all times. You will learn that being a mobster is not something these wiseguys would do over again given the choice. The book has a real way of putting you at the seen of the crime."
2,"Familiar. Same old stuff,","I think Peter Maas is a good writer. It must have certainly been a big job for him to make sense out of whatever Sam Gravano fed him for this book, probably in the form of taped recordings or paper notes. Overall, it's not the writing that bothered me, but like others have said, it is the ""I was a victim"" stance Mr. Gravano takes. After all, he didn't go ""straight"" just for the sake of wanting to live a clean life, did he? Seems like he just wanted less jail time. If you like Mafia related stories, I guess you'll like this one. Numbness set in for me though after reading many of the same old things that you've read in the news and I just couldn't get excited about it or feel empathetic for him."
5,"Ay, fuggedaboudit!","Cool book, but the guy's obviously lying through his teeth. Every mobster, once they feel free to tell their story, tries to make themselves look like friggin' Robin Hood. In the HBO movie ""Gotti,"" they make Sammy the Bull look like a greedy oppotunistic backstabber, and in ""Underboss,"" Sammy makes John Gotti out like a degenerate gambler megalomaniac glory hound paranoid. I bet both of those are true of them, despite the fact that they both left the bad parts about themselves out of their accounts. Truth is, I wonder whether or not Sammy the Bull didn't try to help Chin Gigante whack Gotti, maybe under promises that he would be made boss."
4,Good book in general,"I generally liked this book. On the strong side, the stories were well writen and well told. We feel like we get to have a look behind the closed doors of the mafia and the pages seem to melt away. The only weakness worth mentionning is the fact that Sammy Gravano sometimes gives us the feeling he's telling the story the way he wants it to be told and not necessarly the way it really happened.I admit that in general you tend to like him, but there are those times when i felt he made himself the hero. You can't fail to notice that he never looks bad, thrue all the murders and lies he always ended up being the good guy. That seems hard to beleive. Never the less, it his a good book to get your hands on, the good sides largely outweigh the weaknesses. (sorry for my english, i'm better in french.)"
3,Stick with Wiseguys or Donnie Brasco,"I think that this book is a bit labored with details that really don't add to the rise and fall of Sammy. However, one detail that would certainly help is establishing when alot of Sammy's things are going on. It seems like for the most part, Peter Mass tells you when Sammy was born and then for the most part you're left to figure out on your own when everything else is happening. Other than that, there's really not a lot of surprises. You're halfway through the book before you really get to the nitty gritty of Sammy being the Underboss of the Gambino family. I thought Wiseguys and Donnie Brasco were significantly better for a peek into the world of organized crime."
5,i loved this book way back when,"its funny to watch mob wives now with karen gravano, because i had read sammys book over a decade ago. so, when she talked about 'daddy', i already knew everything. lol. anyway, this book is GRREEAATT. i could not put it down. i developed a serious crush on the underboss while reading it. alas, we do love the bad boys! pick up a copy. its really engaging!"
4,A LOOK INTO THE DARK WORLD OF ORGANIZED CRIME,"I enjoyed reading the book not just for the entertainment value, but also for the things it taught me about life in the mob. Some of the things I learned are the organization structure, codes of conduct, methods of intimidation, sources of mob income, and the absolute ruthlessness of the lifestyle.I like reading these kinds of books not because I think this life these people like Sammy Gravano lead was somehow cool or glamorous. Nothing could be farther from the truth. It's a dangerous, deceptive, wicked lifestyle. I enjoy reading mob books like this because I get a look into a different world I am rarely if ever exposed to. And of course this book, being a true story and interview of a former high-level mob underboss made it a very interesting read."
4,And the lying catches up...,"Though this is a good little read, and interesting about the Mafia under John Gotti, take this book with a huge grain of salt. Mr. Gravano is currently sitting in an Arizona jail, awaiting charges of organizing an Ecstasy drug distribution ring. For a man who claims to have reformed in this book, it just goes to show you cannot take the mob out of the man."
4,Wood egg and spoon set,"The wooden egg and spoon set was a lot of fun for the kids but the paint chipped off easily, making the pretty bold colors look worn after the first usage."
5,"Great Product, better than I expected thx a bunch : )","Great product.... Better than I expected, great weight in the eggs, no splinters with the spoons, great thx, a bunch :)"
3,The size...,I think this is a good book but the size of it is absurd. It's a heavy and bulky hardbook. I have seen better sized books in hardbook for calligraphy. The content is better but it still lacks in that some people are not only looking at to pratice the alphabets but are manvuering around it's size.
5,The Essential book of CorelDRAW,"Let's cut to the bottom line - if you own CorelDRAW 12 you must buy this book. Why? Steve Bain has taken a very large application and distilled its tools and features into a well oganized book. Unlike so many books which describe an application's tools (sounding very much like a rehash of the help files) without ever telling you what you can do with the tools, Steve has created a wealth of practical real world examples of what can be done with using CorelDRAW.Most large books end up on my bookshelf only being pulled down when everything else fails. Because this is such a useful book, I have to refer to it on a daily basis. Point in fact, it isn't on my bookshelf, I use it so often that is it is next to my computer. Like I said at the beginning, if you own CorelDRAW 12 buying this book will be the best investment you will ever make."
5,The BEST CorelDRAW learning/training guide I've read,"This is the best choice of the two available CorelDRAW books (the Unleashed ebook I think is a rip-off - read my review). This book explains each and every tool and program feature in plain English and great detail (infinitely better than the CorelDRAW manual). As a non-designer and new CorelDRAW user, the Official Guide helps me learn what I need to know right away and taught me some great basic drawing techniques. Kudos to the publisher/author!"
2,bad paradigm,"If you're looking for a book to get you up and running with CorelDraw 12, this ain't it. This book uses the ""Start with the File Menu..."" paradigm. The first several chapters are taken up with mind numbingly endless descriptions of menus and tools and options, how to save files (duh) and discussions of features, the function of which the novice user has no clue. You don't actually get to draw anything until way into the second section of the book. (Note that I said Section, not Chapter). Even then, the explanations are so obtuse and convoluted that it is almost impossible for anyone without a vector based application background to figure out what's going on.I suppose if one has experience with Corel or the Adobe products, this book makes sense and probably covers all the bells and whistles. But if you're a relatively computer literate person who just wants to learn how to use CorelDraw 12 from the ground up, get a different book.DB"
1,The item that was never received,"I never received this item.I talked with a customer service rep. and he say that the item was cosider lostand that he will make a new order for me,that was two or three weks ago.I likeAMAZON and i know that the problem is the post office,so way you don't send thepackages priority mail that way it will have a traking number after allthe customer is the one ho pay for S/H.Please see if you can send my item before nex year i start a class on januaryand i need that book.HO you like you reviewJames"
4,Wonderfully priced Replacement Plan,"I haven't had the chance to use this plan as of yet (that just means my vacuum cleaner I purchased is holding up well). But the plan is great, and I like how the time is IN ADDITION to the manufacturer's warranty that comes with the item purchased."
2,Weak Novel,"Some interesting information about Indian culture but writing was poor and characters wooden. Thought the plot rather contrived and the main character annoying (hurry up and tell your parents for heavens sake). The recipes, interwoven, seemed copycat as several books have used this technique now. More of a ""chick lit"" and wasnt up to standard for our Reading Group"
4,Made Me Love India More,"I love India. I've been there several times, and written a book with my husband about some of our friends there. I loved this book because of the ""insiders perspective"" into an Indian family's life. People in the U.S.A. are usually very surprised when they find out that arranged marriages are still very common in India. There are many beneficial, successful marriages done this way, and many that are not.My favorite part of this book is where the author says, ""India was not just a country you visited, it was a country that sank into your blood and stole part of you. As an insider all those years ago I couldn't see it, but now after several years of exile I could feel the texture of India. It was the people, the smell, the taste, the noise, the essence that dragged you in and kept you.""I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves India, or wants to know more about the culture."
3,"Good book, great recipes","I enjoyed this book, however I didn't care for the ending. It doesn't close a few open topics in the middle of the book, made me feel a little cheated at the end. I was searching for one more chapeter."
4,couldn't put it down,"This novel offers you a wonderful viewpoint of Indian Culture - a peek inside the curtain. It particularly focuses on a traditional mother/ daughter tie and the wonderful, world of womens minds. From a 'familial role' point of view, any woman should be able to find someone in the tale they can relate to and appreciate. It's a gripping read as this young woman emotionally travels through her decisions of how much truth to reveal to her family during a visit to her native home in India from the United States where she has been working and has become engaged secretly. It is hard to put the book down, but don't worry, it is a fast read as well as a fun one. Perfect for a plane trip."
3,A Ripe Mango Season Makes You Forget the Heat,"Summary of the Book:A cursory look at an Indian-American's social fabric and the challenges faced by woman in rapidly changing Indian society. The protoganist is based in the SanFran and is in love with an American but does not want to break that news to her conservative family, who do not want her to marry outside her caste/race. The rest of the book records her travel to India to see her extended family and break them the news of her love.Assessment:- Rich characterization of the women characters- Nothing new in they way she developed the plot- No context for the Indian words- Did not provide enough context to understand why her family was against the marriage.Summary:Overall an easy read if you are planning on attending any of your Indian friend's wedding. Don't expect any literary fireworks from this Mango.Fred ""G"" Sanford"
1,OVERATED & OVERPRICED,The Mango Season by Amulya Malladi is an overated overpriced book. I found it boring and goofy. Why all the glowing five-star reviews? I have no idea! Save your money and check this one out of the library if you insist on reading it!!
2,Something was definitely missing,"This book was an easy read, the characters were easy to follow and identify but I just felt cheated after reading this book.I hate to compare books of similar themes; however, For Matrimonial Purposes by Kavita Daswani was a much better book.Mango Season seemed so repetitive. I often found myself wondering why Ms. Malladi mentioned Nick, the great american boyfriend, page after page without really giving him life. At one point I was ready to throw the book after she mentioned yet again how great he was. Enough already! We know he's great, tell us something else.The recipes were a lovely Like Water for Chocolate touch. If you can't find the ingredients in your local market, try the internet.I felt cheated after reading this book. Something mentioned at the bottom of page 224 really ticked me off.I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are looking for a frivolous, quick read that is at times quite boring and redundant."
5,A reader from New York,"I really loved this book. It was so realistic with the way society is today and some of the decisions that have to be make that may not be acceptable to our family. The character in this book had decisions to make and she seemed to go with what was in her heart inlight of everything that transpired. I can really understand what she was going through because a person I love has to make the same decisions. This book was well written, I never put it down and I def. recommend it to anyone."
3,Appetizing book,"Hmm...what can I saw about 'The Mango Season'? I feel kinda bad already for only giving it 3 stars, but I'm being honest. The book wasn't too bad though. It was pretty easy reading, something I read in 2 days. The recipies were interesting...and added to the culturally rich story line. It's not a book to read if you're hungry :p The story was simple, though very detailed in the emotional aspect of tense relationships. It seemed kind of repetative but I figure that's the authors way of stressing the protagonist's dilema. If I really put myself in Priya's shoes, then I can understand her bluntness.What I loved the most though would be the ending.... that twist was a total shocker! I totally didnt expect it, it litterally hit me with full force! The drama then, has only begun..."
4,Parent Mirror Pound-A-Ball,"This toy is awesome for all ages. I got it for my first son when he was 18 months and he still plays with it at 3 1/2! The only bad thing about this toy is that I have been unable to find replacement balls. It only comes with 4 balls and we have lost a couple of them. Other than that, it's a great toy."
5,Every Day Favorite!,"We purchased this for our 12 month old for Christmas and he has played with it every day since. It did not take him long to learn how to set the balls himself and pound them with the hammer. He also likes to use his hands. Some reviewers have said that the balls do not fit through the holes easily enough, but this for us is a plus since it adds more of a challenge for our little guy. I give it five stars because it is so well made and entertaining, but I will say that it is frustrating that the ball tower is separate from the base and easily topples over with too much force. I may try super-gluing the two pieces together. Otherwise, highly recommend!"
1,So Many Problems Here,"I had so many problems with this that I through it away. Buy another pounding toy. The problems were as follows:1. The top part and the tray aren't connectedat all. The top just sits on the tray, which creates storage problems and makes the toy unstable.2. You practically have to be a body builder to get the balls in the holes. I could hardly do it, let alone my small children.3. The balls don't stay in the toy well and go everywhere.Don't buy this one."
3,Be careful of pieces that get hammerd off,"I bought this toy for my grandson age 16 months. He kept hitting it so much that pieces of the plastic chipped off. He put one in his mouth, but luckily his mom saw it and got it out before he choked on it.ALSO it's have to contact Parents to get replacement balls."
2,"Fun, but not well made","My son loves this toy and has used it for a year and a half. (He got it at age 1.) However, I would recommend that you find a similar toy by a different maker. This one gets dirty on the inside without a good way to clean it, and the balls break in half after a while. I finally threw it out today because it is filthy and there's only one ball left!"
3,Love Hate Relationship,"My son received this for his first birthday. Wow! He loved this toy. Big headache for mama, lots of fun for child.However, all of a sudden he was putting EVERYTHING in the holes. He would then do one of two things, come running to me to fix it or try to put his hand as far in as he possibly could to get the item out.It was fun while it lasted but I did give it to a friend's baby so they can enjoy it for a few months also."
2,way too hard to pound.,This toy requires you to POUND the ball really hard. I'm not sure I want my 1 year old to learn to hit ANYTHING with a hammer that hard. I'm putting it away (it was a gift) for a year and then we'll see. I'm super bummed b/c it looked like it would be so much fun.
5,One of the most played with toys,"While I didn't think much of this toy when my daughter got it for her 1st birthday, it has been one of the most used toys we have. She went through the various stages of placing the balls on top, then hitting them down with hand, then increased coordination in hitting it with the hammer, then as she got older, sorting the balls into the correct colored holes. She is four now and it never did get packed away. Even the older neighbors play with it. Now we have been watching our one year old twins enjoy it. When I purchased this one from Amazon, it was actually for my one year old niece. Hopefully she will enjoy it as well."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this toy for my grandsons when they were 11 months and 8-1/2 months. Three months later they are still uninterested. The balls are very difficult to push through the holes. Even when I help them, my grandsons are not interested in watching. I suppose, as with most toys, some children will be entertained by it while others are not."
1,Painfull,"This hooks get a low rating from me. They are to painful to use. Once you grip the bar/dumbbell etc, and wrap your hands around the hooks, they cut in to your hand making it impossible to lift anything heavy. This defeats the purpose of the hooks in the first place."
5,"Exciting, Intriguing, and Entertaining","Jacquie Bamber Moore has hit the ground running with a debut novel that will have you up until the wee hours of the morning trying to find out what happens next. Randi, Umi, and Michelle are best friends that deal with their share of ups and downs but somehow manage to still love and appreciate one another. The book is full of situations that will make one contemplate what they would do if it happened to them. All I Need is definitely worth the read."
3,best skin for your ipod,love it! Has great texture and also protect the ipod. The only thing I would mention is: it doesn't cover the screen.
3,Women writers,"This book is very clear and simple to use. It's short and sweet, which I like. I think most writers could get something from it."
4,Excellant reference,"I am very satisfied with this spy review book especially with the way it is organized. The book is not a narrative, meaning, a story."
3,1-2 per set.,"These birds are OK. I go through about 1-2 of them per set. But obviously if you're not playing a serious game, you just continue with an old and battered shuttlecock. But for the price? Yonex Aerosena's go from $25-$50 and you'll go through about 1-2 shuttlecocks per set as well (we're talking about the new rules to 21 points, rather than the old rules to 15 points). I never tried humidifying the birds before playing with them, as some have suggested. But I do live in Miami and have left the shuttlecocks in my car and it doesn't seem to have changed. Overall, it's not bad considering the price you pay and Victor is a pretty well-known brand. I'm not disappointed, it is what I expect when playing with feathered shuttlecocks."
5,Good Product,I play occasionally but wanted something that would endure my layman skills and still last forever. It did the job.
1,Waste of Money,I play badminton regularly - at an intermediate/advance level.Recently gave a try to this purticular brand of shuttlecocks and I must say its been a big dissapointment.There are much much better shuttlecocks out there if you spend just few dollars more.This shuttlecock can't even take half the beating the other brands do. For every game I end up burning least 3 shuttlecocks.Looks like all the reviews regarding this product are posted by folks playing in there backyard.Stay away from this brand.
2,Does not last long for consistent fly,"I gave it a try, but it does not work that well. After a few smashes, the feather tends to be messed up and the birt slows down significantly. Overall, it is slower than Victor Green No1. Playability is not as good.I will not buy this again.But for the very beginer, it is not bad."
2,Surprisingly Poorly Made Shuttles,"Don't expect these to last. When many players bring their shuttles to the court, you can evaluate which ones you can play with and which ones you can't. Unfortunately, Victor shuttles couldn't last a single game without getting twisted and broken feathers.We put them aside and used DNA shuttles. I wanted to return them, but I still have 6 left, and would not be fair to the seller. I would describe this item as defective and unusable."
2,ok for warm up,bad:very poor durability (expensive for its quality)too lighttoo fastgood:ok quality for warm up
2,dont buy this one,i have always been yonex buyer but this time i thought i would try victor but am utterly disappointed with this shuttle quality. it doesn't even last us for a single game of doubles. i would not recommend this to any of my friends. yonex is the best.
1,Terrible product,Never buy this shuttle birdie. It is the worst of all that is out there. Buy only Aeroplane black bird or Yonex brands.
3,Good not Excellent,"Used this shuttle, as I could not get the Aeroplane brand in Amazon. Expected the shuttle to be much durable, given the brand name. But it is much brittle than expected. Had to use 3 shuttles a game. In all a good one interms of flight and speed, but could be more durable for a practise game"
1,Just Terrible,Worst birdies I've ever played with. Had to use four just for one game. How they keep making them is beyond me.
4,Decent Birdies For a Decent Price,"These are fairly decent birdies! I steamed them before I played with them yesterday, and they got about 1.5 games each before a feather would be broken or missing. Keep in mind they survived twenty-one point doubles games of constant smashing and blocking...but then again, I steamed them. They fly nice and are a heck of a lot cheaper than the birdies they sell at the local club. It is recommended that you steam the birdies 2-3 days before you play them and store them in a humid and cool environment like behind your bathroom door. Hope that helped!"
3,a mixed bag,"Out of the 22 or so short stories in this collection, 3 of them REALLY stood out for me: Medusa's Child by Kim Antieau, Close To The Earth by Gregory Nicoll, and Baseball Memories by Edo van Belkom. They were by far the best in the book. On the other end of the spectrum, contributions by D.F. Lewis, Ramsey Campbell, Nicholas Royle, and Nina Kiriki Hoffman I found to be boring, insufferable, strange, and I couldn't wait for them to be over. I'm a big collector on paperback horror anthologies, and always mark lightly in pencil which stories I ""rate"" as good, on the table of contents as I'm going through the book. So that way years later I can look back at the list of stories and save myself the time of weeding through the boring and/or stupid ones, and get right to the good stuff. Other standout contributions in Year's Best Horror Vol. 20 (in my opinion) were by Dennis Etchison, Jeffrey Goddin, Sheila Hodgson, C.S. Fuqua, and Barb Hendee."
5,A must for those dealing with volunteers,"Working with volunteers can be a most challenging yet gratifying struggle. Jo Rusin's book puts in writing the secrets of recruiting, training, motivating, and retaining volunteers. This is a great book, one I know will prove highly successful. It came through when I really needed this information."
4,Great book!,"I bought an $80.00 book before I bought this one, because the title made me believe that I was getting all the info I needed in one book. Well I wasted that $80.00 because it is very hard to read. So, I finally bought this book...Volunteers Wanted. This book has given me more information than the $80.00 one did. I wish I had bought this book first."
1,Did This Author Know How To Document His Sources?,"I read this at the same time I was reading another biography of Lincoln. Thats how I know that the ""author"" of this book took whole pages from other books and just stuck them in his work without sources being noted.The format in this shorter work is to have each entry preceded by a question that is then answered in the text. For example: ""Was Lincoln really born in a log cabin?"" is then followed by three or four pages of historical detail that answer the question and expand upon it. What I take issue with is that several of the ""answers"" were completely lifted from the other book, word for word, with no footnote.There is a ""sources consulted"" section at the back of the work and the biography in question IS listed there. But proper sourcing should have each section footnoted and each attribution cited directly.Otherwise this sails pretty close to the ""p"" word."
3,Pretty good collection,"Now this is one of the better of the ""Nuggets"" selections, with 9 certifiable national hits out of 18 tunes. A few are out-and-out psychadelic one-hit classics, like the Electric Prunes' ""I Had Too Much To Dream"", or the Strawberry Alarm Clock's ""Incense and Peppermints"". But some of the better tunes, like the Chambers Brothers' great ""Time Has Come Today"" come from groups whose entire catalog is worth having- ""Time"" is from an album that also features their version of the great Curtis Mayfield tune, ""People Get Ready"", ""Midnight Hour"" and more.On the whole, though, this is a good selection of 60s rock and pop with very few exceptions (what is that silly Dino, Desi and Billy track doing here?) that would serve as a good introduction for younger listeners curious as to what Mom and Dad (or maybe Grandma and Granddad) were freaking out to back in the old days."
5,Great TV! phenomenal picture and movies look amazing,"This product was priced better then any other sales location in my area. When we received this product all I did was plug it in an I still haven't adjusted the picture, the best TV I ever owned."
5,"Vivid colors, no problems.","Colors are amazingly vivid, wow! I especially recommend watching the programming on Discovery HD, amazing!Eagle shippers were professional - called ahead to schedule a time for deliver, and even unpacked from the box and setup on the entertainment center.Only regret is that there is only 1 HDMI connector, but that's pretty minor in the grand scheme of things.All in all a great product."
2,"Bunny is white, not blue!","Ordered it for my son, he wanted a blue bunny... Bunny arrived and it is snow white!!! Other then that it is fine, I just wish the picture or the description would state the color more accurately, for us it would be a deal breaker, we needed specifically a BLUE bunny, not white."
2,"I'm a scifi addict, but this one...",The book became a rapidly escalating hard read. By the time I was about one-third through I gave up. Too much to keep track of for a recreational read.. Beter luch next time.
3,Interesting Read,"This book is a good read, but somewhat predictable in parts. The concept of a luxury starliner is a good one. Some of the events are a little far-fetched, even for this genre. There are significant typos, as is common in self-published books but not so many as to make it annoying.Overall, a good, low priced read."
3,Entertaining,"I appreciate an author making his or her work free. Was fortunate to have on my kindle while stuck on a long business trip. Though there were parts somewhat predictable, i still enjoyed the free read. Thanks to the author."
3,Not David Drake's Best Work...,Sometimes you finish a book just because you hate to give up on it. It never really peaked. It needed more character development of the recurring passangers.
3,Good reading,"Loved the story.....but, lots of typos....not a story that makes you sit on the edge of your seat, but good."
3,Starliner,Not a bad story line. Didn't really explain everything real well. You just have to take it stride. Not to bad.
3,Good but could be better,This edition is poorly edited. There are a lot of mistakes that made it past the filters. The story reads like a comic opera but the characters are a little inconsistent but the plot does reflect the port O'call feel of a long distance cruise.
2,Too difficult to keep up,"I enjoy good books. Love sci-fi, but even this one has been too hard to get into let alone keep going. I typically ready a book a day, this one has taken me two weeks and I'm not even half way through it. Gave up yesterday."
2,Old and outdated,I love David Drake. This was boring with some interesting parts.The premise is somewhat simplistic and old-fashioned and it doesn't have the plot development that his later works do.
3,"easy space opera, needs better proofreading","4 stars for the story, a light action romance, -1 star for the annoying typos, about one per chapter.This is a basic man with dark past saves the day and wins the women story."
3,Starliner,"Good escapist read well written. David drake does action scenes better than anyone since Heinlien some sex,explicitly written, May dismay some"
3,Fun but definitely not Drake's best,"A man with a mysterious past joins the crew of the luxury starliner Empress of Earth just as two worlds on the starliner's route threaten war. Since the Empress could transport a whole lot of troops, it's a prime target for hijacking by both sides, which leads to more action and violence than one would usually see on a cruise. This allows a few enjoyable secondary characters to pop up. Oh, and the main character gets laid a lot. Yes, that is the sum total of the plot.That said, I liked the storyline enough to finish reading it, though to do that I had to skip several of the sex scenes (like the one with the alien matriarch). This is a space-going version of a ""men's adventure"" story, where the men are men and the women are willing. You have been warned.Would I reread it? No, but it was fun once."
2,More like a screenplay,"If you have something else to read go ahead. The book has its good points but jumps from vignette to vignette without good flow. The hero is too moody, and his personality inconsistent."
3,Interesting but not great Drake,"Starliner was an entertaining book, and had it's better moments. At the same time, it was fairly basic science fiction. The adventure episodes are somewhat formulaic, and don't always make that much sense if you think about them for that long.However, I did enjoy a couple of the running subplots, and their were some surprising but plausible twists regarding a number of recurring characters near the end.Overall I'd say the story is imminently readable but not that inspired."
2,Not Believable,"I rated it as fair when it actually was between fair and good. Ficton is fiction, especiallty about space travel with many different species of aliens. It takes a special person to write about this material and David Drake is not. I will not read another one of his books. Even though this is fiction we still want the characters to be somewhat believable. The main character is all the superheroes rolled into one. I did not find this book to be awful because the author did find creative imagination in a number of parts of the book. Overall, I was diappointed."
1,Don't buy unless you love Spam!,"When you buy this product you will get a mediocre product at an inflated price. What you will also get when you buy any Ashampoo product is a neverending supply of spam. What you will not get is customer service. Oh, and that little opt out link at the end of your weekly spam doesn't work. So if you like your spam boiled, fried, or just cold canned, welcome aboard."
1,Cheap and Cheaply Fixed,"I bought this product without knowing it was less than 30 pieces and when I put it together and it looked very, very, very cheap. The design of putting it together was horrible; it kept falling apart! I gave up and super-glued the tower together after it collapsed for the 28th time. Now it stays together no matter what, but it still wasn't the quality I usually see in 3D wood puzzles."
2,Mom of 4 great kids,"I found this very hard to assemble. The pieces didn't fit together well and some were warped, making it even more difficult. After it was assembled it continually fell apart. My daughter used this for a presentation and it went in the trash immediately after she was done. Perhaps I was expecting too much from a wooden kit."
1,Amazon Description Wrong,"This is NOT a diamond (PCD) tipped blade. This is NOT a ""James Hardie Building Products"" recognized blade. This is NOT a 6-point 10"" blade as the product image shows.This is, however, a very good Makita 28-point carbide tipped 7 1/4"" blade for Fiber-Cement Board. Relative to the actual specs, this might rate 5 stars. But then, it should also cost less."
5,Great book for anyone new to fly fishing,"This is a great introduction to fly fishing. For a newcomer, the equipment and accessories can be overwhelming. Now, I feel like a can make smarter purchases and not end up with junk. I also now know the terminology so when I go on a guieded trip or even browsing in the store, I don't feel complete stupid."
2,Buyer Beware,Potential purchasers from Amazon should be aware that the item offered is a CD-R with virtually non-existent liner notes.
5,Much better than my HP,"I bought an HP printer last year based on rave reviews at Amazon, and was happy with it until I discovered it couldn't print true red: it comes out as a rusty color. I went to a local electronics store and printed test samples from a half dozen HP's, and they all came out with rust for red. Then I noticed that my photos had a flat, blue tone. I've been thinking of buying a new printer, and was getting ready to buy an Epson, then checked this Canon out. It's a good value, the software that comes with it is really intuitive and easy to customize, and it prints red. So far I'm very happy. At first the photos weren't great, but with some customization of the settings (to ""fine"") they're now high quality. I'll try some different papers to see if I can boost the quality even higher. Much better overall than my HP though. Nice to have red again."
2,SLOW; Bad Software,"Sometimes this machine is horribly, horribly slow. It does not seem to depend on what my computer is doing. It can be up to three minutes per page. And usually it slows down just when I need it to [speed up]!Also, the software leaves much to be desired. I can't program in my preferences and have to keep clicking time after time that I want ""draft"" mode or ""reverse pages."""
1,No print sharing in windows.,"It's funny, I'd always understood printer sharing to be a nowmal window feature. As long as both computers have the proper driver for a printer, one can share a printer to the other. This is not the case for this printer.After spending a couple of weeks getting it working, I sent a note to Canon's tech support. Their response?""Unfortunately, this printer was not designed to be shared across a network.""We have three different computers around the house, used by three different people. This printer isn't exactly portable, so just hauling it around to whatever computer needs it is just unreasonable.I am very disapointed that this very basic functionality has been omitted."
1,"Poor quality printer, stick to HP instead","After reading numerous reviews about great quality of this printer I was seriously upset after connecting it to my Toshibaand not being able to print good quality pictures I was expecting. For example if you set High Resolution printing option, it takes about 10 minutes to print 1600X1200 jpg image.In addition I get faint white lines on the picture and no matter what I do with the configuration of this printer I am unable toget rig of it. Prior to this printer I had HP1215 and to say the least I should have kept it. Please don't look for low price HP is definately worth the price."
5,This one works perfectly with my Windows ME laptop,"I never could get my Lexmark Z42 to work with Windows ME so I bought the Canon S600. It works perfectly with ME, was easy to set up, and the quality of the print is excellent. One feature I think is an advantage is that this uses ink tanks instead of ink cartridges, so it should be cheaper to refill."
5,"Excellent print quality, very easy to change the cartridge","My beloved computer printer recently died, so I've been visiting friends and trying out their printers. I've been told by some that they had problems changing the cartridge of their Canon printers. But this one was easily changed. The print quality was excellent, very clear, with none of the smudged quality sometimes seen on printed pages. I want one!"
4,Bought as text,"I bought this book as a required text for a Design of Experiments (DOE) class. The explanations are pretty straight forward. Answers to problems are in back of the book, a plus."
5,Wonderful and Funny and better than the first,"Wow. What a wonderful book. It's the sequel to the Haunted Tea Cosy and, as well as being longer, it's funnier and the art is great. The pictures are like the ones from the HTC, but they have a hint of Japanese in them. They are coloured in grey and light blue (see cover) and lime yellow. This is a great book and any Goriphile would carry it around with them around the house (like I do)!"
3,The Troubled Dream of Life,"This book provides a fuller explanation (fuller than that provided in Setting Limits) of Daniel Callahan's opposition to using biomedicine for old people (people 75 and older) who are seriously ill and who would likely die were it not for biomedicine. Callahan makes a compelling argument against using biomedicine for this poplulation.Not as compelling (for me) is his argument against euthanasia. Addressing euthanasia is something Callahan must do. He wants to limit (eliminate?) the use of biomedicine for old people who are seriously ill. If he supports elimnating biomedicine, doesn't it follow that he supports euthanasia? Callahan says, ""No"" and makes his case.Although I did not agree with many of the themes developed in this book, it did make me think. That, I think, is one of Callahan's overall objectives."
2,Master modeler only.,"Many, many small parts that have you questioning why so many small parts (i.e. range finding radar parts) have to be put together other than making it in the ""master modeler"" category. I would stick with the 1/600 or larger scales unless you have a magnifying glass, tweezers or kelly clamps, and several files. Also do not like the way the main guns mount to the turrets, totally different than Trumpeter's 1/700 Prinz Eugen's main guns."
1,"Too complicated, too many parts","This product was purchased for a 79 year old brother for his birthday. He found this too complicated with too many parts to assemble. After speaking with your representative, Jessica Bryant, she suggested that the product be sent back to ""Best Service Stores Basic 8250 Underground Drive, Kansas City, Mo 64161. The product was mailed back to the company on July 12, 2010. We have not received credit for the product at this time. We are in contact with Ms. Bryant and she has assured us that we will be receiving a full refund on our credit card.We have no idea why this is taking so long for a credit to be issued since it is almost 3 weeks since the product was mailed. Please have someone check on this. We would appreciate it.Thank you,Jane & Paul Salos"
3,Some ups and downs,"If you have Vista Home, forget it don't buy this product. It's impossible to set up this product with Vista Home. My HP laptop has Vista and with the software update for the PCTV, HAVA, I get the ""NO HAVA Device Detected"". Even hard wired into the router the device can't be located. I rolled back to the previous software version, and Vista locate the device, but when you make a network connection with the PCTV, the Setup wizard says ""Connection with PCTV lost"" even though you have an active connection with the device. Support is awful. There is no phone support, and I still haven't got a response from support to the email I sent them a week ago.The setup was easy with XP on my wife's laptop. The player displays a good quality picture. The only thing is that full screen display had buffering problems.If the company had better support for this product, I would have no problem recommending to anyone. If you only have a Vista machine, wait to get this."
2,Needs Some Work,"I purchased the Pinncle To Go HD Wireless last month, and had it back in the box within a day. Here is the lowdown: The resolution is NOT as advertised. True, the box will allow your PC to record your programming and stores in in either MPEG-2 or MPEG-4 format. Viewing content via the internet, LAN or on my primary PC-- it looked very nice. When burning recorded HD content onto a DVD, and then watching it on a 57"" screen, the quality was laughable. I'm no whiz, but I believe the compression and downcoversion causes the loss-- and ultimatley, I want to be able to record content and archive it for viewing on my TV later-- not just my PC. The IR blaster on my unit did not control my HR 10-250-- and it was one of the default controls. I highly suggest waiting a generation or two before buying a product like this."
5,Excellent Blade,"I have had this blade for about 2 months. It cuts extremely well. I have used it to cross-cut and rip hardwood. When ripping it leaves no saw marks on the wood and leaves a glue ready surface. Crosscuts are clean, no burning and very smooth. I have a number of Freud Industrial blades and this blade performs as well as the Freuds.I have also used it to cut melamine covered particle board and it causes no chipout whatsoever. This is a great blade!"
4,"dated, but apropo","Written soon after '87 crash, it aptly describes the then actual - and still current today - explosion in financial transactions. Easy reading, but plenty of data to press the points. To this day I remember the analogous view of the economic landscape to that of another 'doomsday' author of the day('Brown', more popular, paperbacks, NY best-seller list)though they came to diametrically opposed views how the ineviatable culmination would be handled."
3,NOT BEER BREWING YEAST,"I was searching Amazon for beer brewing yeast and this popped up among the other turbo yeast packets and things. I thought it looked like a good deal, and didn't realize that it was deactivated for supplement use. Don't buy this for your homebrew!Shipping was fast though..."
2,WASTE!!!,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AFTER WATCHING A DOC OZ SHOW AND RUSH TO ORDER, DID JUST WHAT HE DID ON THE SHOW BOUGHT SOME OLIVE OIL,POP CORN,AND A HOT AIR POPPER BUT I WILL TELL YOU UNLESS YOU LIKE THIS STUFF ALREADY DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! TASTE AWFUL!"
5,For the Cats,"TheBrewer's Yeastis for my cats. Every day I sprinkle a little onto their food. They like the taste of the yeast and regard it as a special treat. The yeast provides them with extra B vitamins.One of the vitamins in the yeast is vitamin B1, thiamine. Many people believe that thiamine repels fleas. This has not been proved. However, since the cats like the yeast, they get in on their food. One 18 ounce bottle seems to last forever. Also, they do not have fleas."
3,Good for me!,"I need to increase my nutritional intake due to a health condition. It was suggested I put this on my popcorn to help boost my health. I toss it with some olive oil on my popcorn and treat myself to some Hawaiian sea salt too. It isn't ""much"" but it makes me feel proactive in managing my health. It is certainly an acquired taste. It is helping me with my vitamin levels so I am pleased. It is a lot cheaper on so many levels than a visit to the clinic."
1,I prefer three other brands that taste good,"I lost $9.05 from having to return this awful tasting Twinlab Genuine Brewer's Yeast after I ordered it because of the glowing reviews on Amazon.com. By contrast, Red Star nutritional yeast, Swanson Brewer's Yeast, and Thompson brewer's yeast all taste great and mix infinitely more easily."
2,Twin Lab Brewer's Yeast,"I was disappointed with this product. The consistency was much too powdery. It tended to form clumps in the jar and particles actually rose into the air whenever I scooped some out. I guess that if you wished it to dissolve quickly in a liquid it would be all right. For my use, I would not buy this again."
5,completely awesome,"This is a simple slingshot concept, but with awesome applications. It is intended for use with 3 people, but if you can find a way to make a frame for it ( I used a picnic table and some iron rods) you can add stability and precision in your aim. I like to think of it as a tool for cooling my neighborhood and unsuspecting residents on hot days. If you get it set up right, this thing will launch a small water balloon halfway across your neighborhood, and no one will even know where it came from."
5,It made our Florida Christmas,It can always be a challenge to win the hearts of family members. That's why I chose this product to wow and dazzle my four nieces/nephews.
5,200 yard cannon kit,"Works like a champ. At first I wanted a really powerful launcher and made my own. The problem was that I chose the biggest diameter surgical hose. My students couldn't hold it when it was pulled back. The problem was solved when we attached it to two goal posts. It was good for even small pumpkins. This 200 yard launcher from Amazon uses a smaller hose, and my students can hold their position and really send water balloons flying. They loved it, and had a great time videoing themselves."
3,WHAT A TAPE!,After seeing this excellent tape which takes us back to the early 90's in Sting's career I only want to say one thing...I REALLY MISS NIKITA KOLOFF!
5,Excellent upbeat novel with a twist,"I enjoyed ending this series with a fun, witty couple who had more in common than they ever thought! Proves that hidden layers can be fun and surprising. This story satified my need to bring the Cordina family together happily ever after."
3,Short changed!,"Unfortunatly this kit was shipped in it's original box. The extra clear shipping tape used to strengthen the box was a nice touch. So now I have a kit with no hardware due to the container that arrived with a hole in it. Amazing this kit was not shipped within another box. A good design for the ramp ends though. I wanted the kit with the alluminum wraping the board on the bottom and top of it. The sandwich effect would have given the kit the extra support needed for my motorcycle. I was unable to coordinate that order for that style. Try it and you will know what I mean. So I figure I will use some stong pan washers with some stainless hardware I haven't purchased yet. Between Rampart, Highland and Amazon's websites, no contact numbers to address the shipping disaster, I would rate this as a disappointment. Clearly a possible home run if one could actually get the product they had hoped for."
5,Excellant ramp kit,"For the money you will not find a better deal, well made easy to put together, will last a life time."
3,No thanks,"This is baroque opera done in a big house setting.... Not ideal (I recommend the Minkowski) but, is worth hearing! Vaness sounds great if not overly dramatic"
3,Basically just a lipbalm,"This won't do much to help heal your coldsore blister, but it will help prevent it from cracking.It's basically just a lipbalm with vitamins that are meant to assist the healing, but it didn't do much for me."
5,Surprised and happy...,"I had a similar situation to D.M.B: this was recommended to me by a Whole Foods rep. I'm not a person who gets cold sores all the time, I believe the last one that I had appeared around five years ago. But I do know what it feels like when they're coming in, as well as what the texture of the skin is at that stage, and I could tell that one was about to appear on my upper lip a few days ago. After rubbing this product on that spot several times a day for the past three days, I can honestly say that it did the trick - I see no sign of a sore at this point. Really surprised, I had relegated myself to the fact that I was going to be living with ugly, painful cold sore for the next couple of weeks. So relieved, and so glad that I went looking for a solution. Highly recommended."
3,"Not for me, but it still helped.",This is a lip balm so there isn't much to say...As a pro it did help get rid of my cold sore and chapped lips faster.As a con I didn't really like the taste and feel of it on my lips.Those are my 2 cents.
3,misleading photo,"i assumed, unfortunately incorrectly, that i was purchasing all 3 items pictured in the photo and was somewhat disappointed to only receive the one in the middle. while a great product, i feel it was overpriced."
5,Love this!!,"This is the best chapstick for people who suffer from cold sores. I carried it on my key chain for a little while cuz I thought it was so nifty, but then I realized I looked like a walking ad for herpes. Now I just carry it in my purse or keep it around the house for anytime I feel a cold sore coming on... Definately recommend keeping one of these around!"
2,Don't be fooled by this one - Toshiba cut corners.,"This camera has a sensor that is 1/2 the size of the previous model (IK-WB11A) and it shows: The video quality never really escapes being pixelated, even at the highest resolution settings. Toshiba's rigamarole about it being a ""Super (Honeycomb) CCD"" sensor can't escape the fact that sensor size and number of pixels is the bottom line and the tiny sensor in this camera is a big step backwards.This camera also regrettably sheds wireless networking, but does have optical zoom and marginally faster responsiveness. However, if you're looking for really clear video, keep shopping. Haunt eBay for an old stock IK-WB11A and you'll probably be much happier. (Note: I have several 11A's and 15A's in use side by side.)"
4,Good camera for the money; 1GB limit on SD card.,"Its a good camera for the money. Records motion well and has a good resolution. I was not impressed that the SD card has a 1GB limit and Toshiba has not released any new firmware to fix this. Also, the camera's speed is faster than other in the same price range, but still produces blurry images in dark lighting."
2,Keep Looking,"Camera is actually a nice package and does exactly what I bought it for. Comes with a nice feature set. It can act as an intervalometer and ftp or email snapshots. Motion trigger. Good image for what it is. The problem I have is that the viewer requires the use of Microsoft Internet Explorer and ActiveX controls. YOu can't view images using Firefox or Netscape or Safari. IE 6 or later, only. Stupid. Probably to support the feature where you can click anywhere in the image and the camera will center the image there. Not worth it. I'll find another product and this one will go on ebay."
5,The bomb diggity!,"Of all the books I've read I have to say this is the best. The series alone is great! In this book Galleria tries to be the leader of the group and bosses them around. So Chanel tells her it's not happening. (But I like the old Aqua and Angie better, They are featured in the series 1-4)"
1,too small,Sent it back. There were no dimensions listed and it turns out the roll is VERY tiny: only 3/4 in. wide and 3/4 in. tall. The size makes it unrealistic looking and the $3.95 price tag is too much. The roll from Plan Toys is a more realistic 2 1/4 in. by 3/4 in.
4,Good fun,"Although I don't consider this CD one of Commander Cody's best, it is great fun and a must for your collection."
2,The drag of all times,I came to this Opera through sort of a back door. I was watching a documentary on Maria Callas. And several times he mentioned that she played Norma. Somehow I had overlooked this Opera so I thought I would catch up. This was the only version that was readily available I thought Norma is Norma is Norma.I can see now that I made a small mistake. In general I don't like things that are in modern dress. But again I thought normal is Norma was Norma. I waited for them speak when they did I sort of wish they didn't. I have to confess I was using English subtitles. The production never got any better. It just drag on and on and on.One day I hope to look at a different version and see what it is that Norma that makes it a classic as this version was the drag of all times.
2,sonido envolvente?,"Todo bien en cuanto a la imagen, pero el sonido envolvente (5.1 sorround sound doesn't exist)prometido en las especificicaciones no existe...."
1,Norma-----------NOT!,"Avoid this ridiculous ""Concept"" Norma at all costs, unless you want to plunk down nearly $40.00 for what is the most tired, trite staging of this magnificent opera I have ever seen. Don't the Euro-Trash directors have any new ideas? More of the same old 1950 period costumes with Norma making an entrance dressed like Norma Desmond with a turban and sunglasses, signing autographs for the Druid chorus.The stage business is completely ludicrous, and reduces the magnificent music to a meaningless side show.The cast all have beautiful voices and certainly deserve a better staging than this psuedo-arty nightmare..Patrick C. Byrne"
1,"Coughing, Coughing, then some more coughing... and then worse","I have never heard so much crowd noise on any recordings and I own 6000 CDs/SACDs. The stage direction is not even close to be related to the libretto. Through 6 sittings, I managed to go through about 60% of it, but this disk is going to the garbage bin. Too bad because the vocal/orchestral interpretation is quite good."
4,Timeless Jazz,"Excellent recording by this talented group of all-stars. Recorded in 1990, this is the fourth and final CD by this quintet. With Bobby Hutcherson on Vibes, Harold Land on Sax, Cedar Walton on Piano, Billy Higgins on drums, Buster Williams on Bass and Steve Turre on Trombone it is difficult to go wrong. All five are leaders in their own right. This recording features compositions by all members of the group except Higgins. The music is hard bop/post bop. Solos are delivered with the grace and intelligence one would expect from musicians of this caliper. I believe this is also the final pairing of Bobby Hutcherson and Harold Land, who together produced some of the finest hard bop recordings you will ever find. I highly recommend any of the late 60's Blue Note recordings that feature these two great artists. If you are a fan of Bobby Hutcherson, Harold Land or Cedar Walton I recommend all four of the recordings by this group if you can find them."
3,BUYER BEWARE!,"I ordered this piece some time ago and it was a CD-R, and the graphics on the cover are very washed-out looking. It also won't play on certain CD players of mine, typical CD-R."
5,Haunting,"Seven years after I plucked this slim book off my university library's dusty shelf, the stories still haunt me. The words are beautiful and eloquent without being contorting, the stories - compelling and personal. I was thirteen when I left my birth country, my parents in their fifties. This book paints both experiences and shows that ripples continue to move through one's life after such a big change. Reading this book is a worthy experience to have.""Look, my little one. Here, all over this graveyard, strangers sleep forever. This land did not give birth to them, did not rear them, but it killed them. They cheated their own land, so they forfeited their right to be buried in it. Blessed is the man who's buried in his own soil, in his homeland."" (p. 65)"
5,Excellent moisturizer without dreaded greasy feeling!,"I love, love, LOVE this lotion. I am a lotion addict and have tried almost every brand over the years. Kiss My Face Honey Calendula beats them all - even the prescription only brands my doctor recommended.PROS:Heavy moisturizing properties in a light, non-greasy formulaFantastic scentPump dispenser bottle in a unique shape that doesn't tip or slide - no need to hold the bottle as it easily dispenses with one handCONS:Sometimes hard to locate in stores. Walgreens no longer carries it. Thank god for Amazon!"
3,"SAY, WHERE'S THE SHEA BUTTER?","I received this lotion in a gift pack containing in addition to the lotion a shower gel, a candle and a loofah mitt. (Don't ask about the loofah mitt - the hemp was so rough that it actually scraped).This is an okay lotion. The addition of lavender and Shea Butter sounds good, but I can't find the proportions of either on the bottle. The lavender fragrance is very muted, and doesn't really smell wonderful such as in say, L'Occitane. Somehow, due the moisturizing effectiveness I wonder if there isn't quite enough Shea Butter included.On the plus side it is a very generous 16 oz. bottle for not very much money. (Who was it who said you get what you pay for?)"
2,I suppose you get what you pay for.,"I am so disappointed with this product. I am a lavender lover but the scent of this product really misses the mark. I kept waiting for the scent to blend with my skin, anything but it remained unappealing. The ingredients are written mostly in Latin, including the first ingredient, water. For a brand which is sold in natural food stores and organic shops the list of ingredients was also disappointing. I agree with the reviewer who recommended L'Occitaine. Kiss My Face seems to have really gone downhill. I think I am going to give this entire 6 oz. tube to my coworkers. On a more positive note, this item is cruelty-free. Still, I think you can find a much better quality moisturizer with incredible scents in the same price range with the ShiKai brand. I gave this product 2 stars because of the generous portion and the fact that it's cruelty-free, but that's it."
3,l&s shea butter,"the product is ok, except the lavender is too strong. I have health challenges, really wanted something with shea butter, i used to make my own salves etc...find it has a smooth consistency, just over powering with the scent.I'd like a product with less ingredients, particularly whole ingredients."
3,DO BELIEVE THE LAVENDER'S LACKING,"received this lotion in a gift pack containing in addition to the lotion a shower gel, a candle and a loofah mitt. (Don't ask about the loofah mitt - the hemp was so rough that it actually scraped).This is an okay lotion. The addition of lavender and Shea Butter sounds good, but I can't find the proportions of either on the bottle. The lavender fragrance is very muted, and doesn't really smell wonderful such as in say, L'Occitane. Somehow, due the moisturizing effectiveness I wonder if there isn't quite enough Shea Butter included.On the plus side it is a very generous 16 oz. bottle for not very much money.

2,Snapped and Whipped My Back Pretty Bad,"After using this item a few times a week within the last 2 months and after only purchasing it a few months ago, it seems the left elastic band plastic rotator was melted by the elastic bands heat. The plastic rotator snapped and whipped my back pretty bad. Hardly ever used it and once I started using it 3 times a week within the past 2 months with slight pressure.. this happened. Your better off probably going to the gym using hard core equipment at least that doesn't seem like it would snap and whip you on the back."
4,Everlast Pilate Door Gym,"This item is awesome, it really works for me...i've been using it for weeks now since i got it..."
5,excellent for the money,"this product surprised me...there is a lot of tension that can be obtained when using this piece of equipment and you can really feel the workout...i use a pilates springboard at the gym and i was pleased with the ""burn"" using this product.i would recommend it to others."
2,Photos and description were misleading,"It works great, but remove it from the door when you're done using it. I know that you get the impression that the door attachment brackets are made of sturdy metal, but they are actually made of flimsy plastic. They bend and warp, and you have to hold them in place while you close the door, because they get pulled over the doorway by the tension. My buddy didn't notice, and he forced my door shut, breaking it. Terrible design."
1,a total disappointment,"I have done taebo in the past, such as taebo amped. I thought that this one was a step up, but I was sadly mistaken. he constantly talked and talked. I barely broke a sweat. He paused way too long between each exercise. Also, each dvd starts off with a demo of how to do the moves. I fast forward that part. It may be good for someone who has never done taebo before, not for me though."
1,Not recommend this kind of wrong Item,"I really disappointed today's shopping .I do not recommend this item beause of wrong discription this item.I recheked svmproduct web site and find big fault.Main problem is as follwing.1.You mentioned product discription throug your web site,each part of the workout discs are 63min. 53min. and 58min.2.You mentioned workout called ignition,acceleration,transformation areseparately on each discs or complete version.3.On your product, it is not a ignition, just for ignition express.4.Also each workout or discs with word or phases of express.5.with express means just a information or introduction partly and around 20min. length.5.I guess this product is not a big different between yours andsell by billy blanks.com6.I guess this product is a same as other one sold by amazon.comI will request this shop for refund due to any fault of svmproduct.I do not want further trouble with any customer."
5,Billy Blanks Taebo T3,"This product was exactly as advertised on Amazon. Delivery was fast, so overall purchase experience was great. The video, I just started exercising to the video this week. I think it is an amazing product. I am in poor physical condition hence I bought this video. The first invigorate video I'm watching is challenging, but at the same time I am able to accomplish feeling very good. The funny thing is the third time watching the workout seems to be even more intense as my body begins the transformation."
3,Not what I was expecting,I'm a big fan of Billy's Teabo training. I've been working out with is different workouts for the past 10 years. Taebo 3T is like the old Taebo with 1pound weights. I was expecting upgraded workouts. This is more for beginner.
4,Canon EF 100mm f/2 Lens,"Excellent lens for the price. Fast AF and sharp all the way open at f/2. Doesn't have the image quality or AF speed of an L lens, but at a third of the price (compared to the 135 f/2L) you get one awesome prime lens. Doesn't come with a hood. I strongly recommend getting one."
4,Canon EF 100 mm F2,"I love this lens just wish I had gotten it sooner. I am still learning how to best use it for action shots, but right now it's far better than any other lens I have for that purpose. It takes beautiful landscape and portrait photos. Focus is quick. Now, looking at the next lens I can add to my collection."
4,an almost perfect portrait lense,"A very nice portrait lense, very fast and very clear. There is a faster 85mm lense, but I like the look of 100mm ... I just wish they had made this faster as well."
3,OK lens,"This is an OK lens and after using it for a while, I've determined it is it is best used only for detail shots. I did have some focusing issues on it, that would be the only downfall."
5,Wonderful for beginner walkers!,"We got these for our 8 month old daughter while she learned how to walk these were a great buy. Very supportive and sturdy, we love these. She is a full bloom walker now, we still prefer these over any other sneaker as far as support."
4,Nice First Walker,I got the wrong size and am waiting for my Grandson to grow into it but it a nice little walking shoe just like his Daddy wore.
3,Durable,"Shoes were cute and very gender neutral, I liked that about them. But, they were very hard to get his foot in and that's with even buying a wide size. Aside from that, once we did get them on they looked great & were durable."
1,club dance basic vol 2 hip hop moves for men,it have no dance move.it have only gringing all over a lady. you will learn nothing on dancing.this tape is not the one.
1,Disappointment galore---Truly Despicable,"The sound quality is great, you couldn't ask for better, but unfortunately the show is marred by Schenker's very sorry performance. His playing on that night was weak, lame, and disgraceful. I can not recommend this cd. If you want to hear better performances from Schenker-era UFO then check out what the BBC issued (""74/80"" or ""In Session"")."
5,OUR AMERICA Life and Death on the South Side of Chicago,"Your America may be a bit different from LeAlan Jones's and Lioyd Newman's...welcome to theirs. These young men bring you into their community were you find yourself laughing at time and then wanting to reach out and save them. This reading is not sugar coated...your heart will break. LeAlan and Lloyd have used thier power to speak, listen to what they have to say! Then you will be blessed with John Brook, the talented young photographer whose images grace these pages of this outstanding book.I have great respect for these men in this book for they are our future. Chicago, my home, is a better please because of these talented men...Continue to speak with your mighty voices."
5,MY Daily Lotion,"Great product, use it every day right out of the shower. Keep it in my car and at my desk at work. I burn very easily and this is the only product I have found that does not feel like a sunscreen. Since I have been using it daily, my skin looks more healthy. LOVE IT!!!"
5,An absolute classic,"The sweet sounds of Ella Fitzgerald mingle perfectly with the gravelly voice of Louis Armstrong. This album is filled with so many of their classic hits. Forget the remakes, these originals are superb!! Their rendition of ""They Can't Take That Away from Me"" is my all-time favorite and ""Isn't It a Lovely Day"" can make the grayest of days a little sunnier. These old-time jazz standards are a great introduction for anyone wanting to get into jazz and blues."
2,Where's the Mystery?,"""Immaculate Midnight"" by Ellen Hunt is the first, and probably the last, novel I've read in the Jane Lawless Mystery Series. Hunt weaves a good story, one that is relaxed and attenuated by a meandering plot, one that ultimately satisfies only superficially. One can read the notes from above for information about the plot if they are interested, and it is a good story as far as a story can go. But it isn't much of a ""mystery"" -- even in the end. There's no point in guessing who the culprit is, because there isn't enough information on which to base any speculation. In the end there is no surprise, because there is no suspense leading up to who it might suddenly be. There was a glaring typo ""alter"" for ""altar"" and numerous run-on sentences, but otherwise the book is well edited."
5,Easy-to-Follow Rules,"There are a number of variations in Mexican Train rules. The rules on this site are based on the original Parsons rules and are clear, easy-to-follow, and make for a very good game:www.MexicanTrainRulesAndStrategies.com"
3,Mexican Train Game review,Mexican Train Dominoes in Tin- we have played it several times with family and friends - it is easy to learn and lots of fun to play
5,Hours of FUN,"As one member of a little foursome that gets together once a week for a relaxing evening of games, we have spent many enjoyable hours of fun with Mexican Train. If you are one who likes a good strategy game, then this is the one for you. But be careful, the strategy can change at the placement of a die. A game that will definately keep you on your toes and keep the cranium from getting rusty."
5,A Totally Delightful Game!,This product has been a delight to the young and the old in our family!Couldn't enjoy it more!
5,Love this game!,"I was really happy about the price and quality of this item....only glitch, the tin was dented! Plus, the train whistle didn't work at first, but I took out the batteries and reinstalled them and then it worked fine."
3,displeased with product,"i wrote a review almost as soon as i received the mexican train saying a few of the dice were chipped and i didn't like the idea that you could tell what dice they were,you haven't contaced me to say the next step in contacting the company.i'm not happy at all.215-858-0095 dorothyjeanne dagostino"
4,Mexican Train,I really enjoy this game. It is exactly what I had ordered. The batteries were dead when the game arrived and I had to buy 3 new batteries. This is a fun game and the one I was looking for. I'm glad the selling price was not extensive because the batteries cost more t han the game!
5,Mexican Train,We've had a lot of fun playing this game. It is very addicting! I would definitely recommend it to others.
3,BE CAREFUL!,"Be careful when you order this! The same set is being sold by different sellers on Amazon for very different prices. I added this to my basket from the site selling it for $18.99, but after it was shipped, found out that somehow, I was charged $27.97. Somehow between the shopping cart and shipping, it got diverted to the other seller. I have no idea how that happened and customer service was less than helpful. After spending way too much time on the phone with some very rude people, I was finally told just to reject the package when it comes and re-order it. I definitely won't reorder but will get it locally instead. The game itself is a lot of fun and worth getting, just not through Amazon."
3,Have fun and learn,I would have rated this game higher but the battery was dead and had to be replaced before the first time trying to play the game. Other than that everything was O.K.
4,Just fine.,"I think the colors are pretty blah and hard to differentiate especially if using them for younger or older audiences, but the tiles are nice, the sounds are obnoxious and fun just as expected, the little trains are handy and we are enjoying playing with the set.I think I am going to get some model car paints and repaint the blah colors (green esp) so they are easier to identify. Our daughter has an 8 year old fundex boxed set that has beautiful colors and I had hoped these would be the same. Nothing a little paint and time cannot fix!"
5,fun family game,"this is a fun family game that everyone can play, it's well made, it's a wonderful gift, everyone likes it."
1,Buyer Beware,"My family played this game at a friends house and really enjoyed it, so we purchased it. The first one we received didn't work. Customer service was indifferent and getting the replacement part was slowwwwww. I expect much more when I buy a product"
3,Missing domino,"On first time using this domino game with invited friends, we discovered that the double 11 domino was missing, and in its place was a twelve and eleven domino all in maroon rather than the two colors. Instead of going through the hassle of returning the whole set and not being sure of what I would receive to replace it, I opted to paint over one of the pips on the 12 side. THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN!"
5,Mexican Train Roars down the Tracks,"Our family loves Mexican Train and play often with our kids who are ages 16, 9 and 5. It simple enough for the 5 year old and ""cool"" enough for the teens and their friends. What I love about this game is every kid (and parent!) that comes over loves to play it. For more Family Night Ideas, visit us at [...]."
5,Joe from Wantagh,This is a great game that all can play. The only thing that was wrong with my game was that the train station had a piece of plastic that was broken off. It was a part that should have lit up.
2,Disappointed in quality,"It looks like it was already used. The backs of some of the dominoes were discolored, scratched and/or pitted in some areas. The thickness wasn't consistent, either. There are a few dominoes that are thicker or thinner than the average. One of them was so thick that it absolutely wouldn't fit in the racks we bought. We're going to keep them, rather than spend the money to send them back. But we will keep our eyes out for another set."
5,Excellent,"Excellent article, fulfills my expectations of purchase. Regalarcelo buy it for my father who likes these games, we could not play but we knew before by a relative who had it, is fun and meets all the conditions offered in the sale."
4,Senior Loads of Fun,"The first time I played at friends and had so much fun, came home and looked on Amazon and found many choices for products of this game type. Like what I picked and would past on the good word for fun, entertainment and sharing."
5,Great Family Game,Great for family get togethers. My children are finally playing a game that makes them actually use their minds. This is a game of strategy. Kids love it. My kids are 8 and 7 and all they ask to play is Mexican Train. I couldn't be happier.
4,Mexican Train Dominos,"The game is fun. However, there is supposed to be a train whistle that does not work."
5,"Top Pick for a Behind-the-Scenes Look at ""Street"" Games","Did you lose money in the tech bubble during the late 90's? Gasparino goes behind the scenes to reveal how investors were completely duped by the world's largest investment firms. If anyone wants to know the games Wall Street plays with the markets, this is often my number one suggestion."
2,A rehash,"I have great admiration for the work of the Wall Street Journal reporter who wrote this book, but I read through this book very quickly and tossed it aside. It simply does not significantly advance the story beyond what has already been told. Mr. Zamansky's story, for instance, was already recounted in the Journal. I can understand his gratification at being mentioned in the book as well, but that is not a compelling reason for the rest of us to buy it"
3,Don't think you can expect more from a Reporter,"For those of you like me, who have not lived/followed the dot.com bubble and decline, this book will somewhat be helpful: it draws the chronological events with probably some details, confidential elements and definitely clearly picture the Bad Guys responisble for the disaster that led to so many individual investors financial failure. Lesson I have learned, as an individual investor: Always use your JUDGMENT-Do not trust so and so because they have been experience or because they seat in a fancy office in Wall Street."
5,Fair and accurate,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It gave me an inside look into Wall Street that I have never read before. It was fair and accurate, and a fast read."
2,"Lackluster, unsophisticated","Unlike most of the reviewers so far, I'm not a friend of the author and am not mentioned in the book. I'm just a reader. I'm sure Mr. Gasparino is the terrific reporter that all his pals say he is, but he has written a pretty lackluster book. Stilted prose with very little of importance that is new. Not in the class of the better Wall Street books and written without flair or sophistication."
4,Internet selling marketplace,Plenty of detail here in this book about the Internet IPO craze of the 90's and all the players involved.
3,"For what they are, they do their job","Without these tables, the sander would be difficult to use. I wish they were longer. You still get a lot of snipe"
2,Definitely Archival,"With a dream cast like this, I'm surethe lucky audience who experiencedthis performance live at the Arena diVerona will never forget it. However,the quality (both audio and video) ofthis DVD is so bad that it's barelywatchable. So unless you're a die-hardfan of Bergonzi, Cossotto, and Gencer(which I am), I'd skip this one."
5,Great Ideas!,"I have long been a fan of Bill Marvin's publications and have utilized many of his ideas in my own restaurant. This book is no exception. While many of the ideas presented are geared towards a more upscale environment, I have been able to use more than a few in the restaurant that I operate, which is a unit of a national chain. With a little thought, you can adjust most of the ideas in this book to fit your needs!"
4,Solid Author,"Bill has been around the industry for years and has a collection of some great restaurant marketing ideas from having spent years in the industry and consulting to many restaurant companies. I really respect his approach and background and would recommend this book without reservation.For more restaurant marketing resources, also visit www.quantifiedmarketing.com.

4,"Book of Common Prayer 2004, Church of Ireland","Length:: 5:22 MinsHere I review the Book of Common Prayer 2004, Church of Ireland: what I wish I knew before purchasing it...with some highlights and disappointments..."
5,Excellent! Outstanding,"I was totally amazed by this book. Once I began to read it, it was virtually impossible to stop. I was totally absorbed by all the characters, and wish that there could have been more in this fabulous series (especially about Tarrant). This is one of the best Sci-fi/Fantasy books you will ever read. You will not regret reading it."
5,Excellent Read,"I picked up this book and couldn't put it down until I was done! It was a very dark fantasy with interesting characters and for once everything wasn't black and white, but rather varying shades of grey. I was also very glad that there wasn't the usual ""happily ever after"" type ending."
5,Probably the best fantasy book I've ever read,I feel the entire concept was spectacular. I would love to see a movie made from this book.
4,Not too bad,"The most original and intriguing aspect of this series is the author's conceptualization of the ""fae"" - a natural force of Erna that manifests human fears and emotions to give them physical form. The plot and character development are not especially powerful. There is a tendency to gloss over necessary details in favor of action and psuedo-theological thoughts. Gerald Tarrant, the hunter, remains the best developed character even though he does little enough to fulfill the promise in the first few introductory chapters. I found the sequel to be a mere parody of this book and utterly useless except as a stepping stone to the 3rd boo"
2,Yawwwn,"Normally, I always Finish books. Not this time. Just can't put up with one more page of this childish drivel. There are parts where it just seems like somebody ripped out a chunk of pages and you're left thinking, huh? He just met her and now he's grieving because he was so in love with her...? It's is just all over the place. I decided to read this after some other reviews from people who said this is their most favorite series ever. Well, now I know that they havent read any other series. Pass it on by."
1,booooring,"I will first admit that while I like the fantasy novels I've read, I'm not well versed in the fantasy genre as a whole or its conventions. I bought this book because it kept coming up in my Instant Recommendations for Guy Gavriel Kay books, and he's my absolute favorite. I swear I wanted to like this book. I tried to like this book. I read as far as I could -- about 3/4 of the way through -- before I finally gave up and cast it aside. I never give up on books, but I'm a characterization junkie and these cardboard cutout Action/Adventure stock characters had absolutely nothing going for them. Their motivations were sketchy at best, and these walking cliches never grew into anything other than what they were on page 1. I respect Friedman for trying to create a world that was unique, but I believe her ambition outstripped her reach on this one."
4,gives a different twist to the classic fantasy/sci-fi book,"usually when you think about fantasy, you think of dragons and magic and stuff like that. with this book, the fantasy deals with the ""fae"" and the term sorceror isn't someone that does magic and stuff, but someone that can control the fae, to a degree. i like how in this book, the ""good"" guy kind of forms an alliance with the ""bad"" guy. then they go on a quest to save someone they're both concerned about for different reasons.all in all, i enjoyed the book. i hope you did/do too."
5,I wished I didn't have to sleep so I could finish it...,"One of the best books I have ever read (and I read a LOT). The author has come up with an extremely interesting and original world populated with characters that are real people- not just standard ""Villain"", ""Hero"", ""Heroine"" types. The characters show the complexity of how people are so thoroughly you feel you are traveling right along with them. This was a book that thoroughly captured my imagination and left me torn- if read it as fast as possible to find out what happens then it would be over that much sooner!"
1,movie script?,"Ok, first off, I hate when the characters think to themselves, I can take it if it is only a very small amount, but the author really doses the reader with italics of the characters thinking to themselves this or that, almost like a movie. It's as if the author was just looking for a movie deal with this work. I read all three books, by far the best part is the beginning of the 2nd book telling some history of the world she has created. Much more time could have been spent in world building, and much much less in how the characters thought or acted. Also, if you are looking for epic battles etc... look elsewhere. The only thing epic about this series was the cliched interaction with the characters with each other or themselves. I read the whole series only because once I start a series, it is very very hard for me to abandon it...wish I had never started it."
1,5 stars..I think not,"I do not know why this book got so many 5 star ratings. The world is original, yet too much attention is given to mind power, while the so called ""magic"" is just too complicated.The action in the story is void of any creativity at all, and the book is simply too long. It did not grab my attention at all, and I don't see how it could have grabbed anyones.Save your money for something better...this book is a complete waste."
1,Is this a pastiche or is it for real?,"After reading the first few pages I was convinced this was a send-up of all those pompous, 3-volume, Lord-Of-The-Ring-wannabe fantasy tomes, chock-full of cliches with at least 3 adjectives to any noun ... alas, Friedman is dead serious.Well, I'll grant this: he's created the apotheosis of this genre.Save your money for something better than a nauseating rehash."
4,Well written but uninvolving.,"Though well written, the magic system is confusing and the plot is uninteresting. It all revolves around retrieving some memories or something from a character we just met and don't really care about. There were a few times when I forgot why the main characters were going on this dangerous journey in the first place. The action and imagery were fantastic, though, and I may finish this trilogy after all."
4,Good enough to reread,"I picked this series up because I enjoyed ""In Conquest Born"" so much, even though I was a little leery of the fantasy rather than s-f plot. However, once I started reading it I didn't want to put it down, and I found myself scouring local bookstores for volume 2. The book (and the trilogy) has a very interesting premise, engaging characters and an enjoyable plot. It was skillful the way Ms. Friedman introduces the reader to a truly evil character at the beginning, and then persuades you to be sympathetic to him. I recommend this book."
3,Mediocrity at its finest.,"I am a huge fan of fantasy novels. My favorite author is David Gemmell. He hasn't had a new book out recently so I picked up a copy of this book. I was dissapointed in what I read. Ms. Friedman's storytelling skills are below par for a quality fantasy/horror story. She never excercises a good use of climax. She doesn't build up suspense at the right times in the story. Her character are the most flat generic people ever to be published in a book. The villains in the story have no motivation and seem to have no past either. However her creativity almost makes up for this. But I found myself questioning the hero's motives all through out the book. She did a very good attempt at creating a wonderful world, she just didn't know how to utilize it."
2,average at best,"this book is nothing special. some of the characters are alright but i didnt really care about them. the problems with this book is that there are only like 4 characters in the book, thats it you dont even know what they are up against or what they're trying to accomplish until the end. and the thing the really irritates me about this book is how whatever problem arises there is always one and only one way to solve it, and it is always dangerous and it is always some unexplained use of the magic or something completely ridiculous that has never occured until this point in the story, so if for instance the characters need to climb a mountain in 2 seconds its ok cause his magic can transport them to the top when they have been walking the whole book, ... like that. dont waste your time with this book, pretty boring and ridiculous, corny secondary characters and plot that fails to grab you"
2,Like a good teeth pulling,"I've read 16 chapters, trying hard to get into this book. I love the creativity of an alternate world with differing powers that fae represent. However, the protagonist barely seems real, made up words to discribe communities and things baffle me, and discritions are flat. In addition, characters and perception meander so much, there is not a thread I can grasp onto.It is good so many are enjoying this book. However, I regret purchasing it."
5,Interesting Evil,Friedman gives us an evil character you can like in the form of Tarrant. When most authors write out an evil character they simply tell us its evil. We see the evil of Tarrant from the word go when he tortures and kills his own beloved family for immortality. Awesome start to a good series
5,Solid and Enjoyable Fantasy,"This isn't the most deep book that was ever written, but it doesn't need to be. It is a sold, good story with great characters. I enjoyed every minute of this and the two subsequent books in the series."
3,Kindle version has many typos,"I don't really understand why the Kindle versions of books have so many typos. Even if the book is old enough that the original edited file isn't available, all the publisher needs to do is to have a human with a good eye read the scanned text. This is not as bad as some Kindle books I've (unfortunately) purchased, but it's still jarring to have the planet on which the action takes place, Erna, referred to as Ema half the time. Or to have humans referred to as ""flesh-bom"". Perhaps I'm unduly picky, but for me it definitely detracts from the experience of reading the book.The book, I like."
5,A Magnificent Work,"I _hate_ the person who recommended me this book. I had papers to write and deadlines to meet. :-)This book is truly one of a kind. Though the prologue gave me the impression that I wouldn't enjoy the book, that first impression was quickly to be dismissed. In it, we look at a humanity that has suddenly had to deal with magic, and see their own nightmares come true, by force of their own imagination!But more than an interesting setting, the _crucial_ point of this book is the struggle between good and evil in our own hearts, and the little ways which can led us into a position where we see ourselves forced to do things we despise even while in full control of our actions and of free will.The plot of the book serves more as a background to the above than as a foreground story. Nevertheless, it's still a well-thought plot that will keep you turning the pages, even though it lacks unpredictable twists."
1,dont be fooled,"i cant believe so many people gave this book good rankings. the characters and plot are boring, you never truly know what they are trying to accomplish. ..."
1,Too large and too heavy,"I thought I would like the bigger screen size, but the unit is just too heavy. The windshield holder cannot properly hold the weight of the unit, and it sags until it touches the dashboard. The battery pack cannot be used while in the windshield holder so you must use the DC car adapter. The DVD player can make the unit incredibly hot, so we used it only for short periods of time as we did not want to over heat the unit. After 2 years of use, the unit is no longer working properly; upon start up the navigation program won't load. I did some research and found this is a common problem."
1,Derivative,"I found the contents highly derivative; moreover, I prefer my guidebooks to be written by specialists in their chosen field. Joe Cummings may be a Thai specialist, but he is no Myanmar expert and, alas, it shows. Not recommended. Readers interested in Burma should try seeking out a copy of a book entitled ""Shades of Gold and Green: Anecdotes of Colonial Burmah 1886-1948"", which may be available through Amazon."
1,Highly derivative,I have been most disappointed indeed with all the Lonely Planet books on Myanmar (Burma). They seem to be highly derivative and I would not recommend them.
2,A typical Lonely Planet,"This book was published in 1996 and many things in Burma have changed since then. Though, it is a very good text for finding upscale hotels and eating establishments, backpackers will be very upset with the outdated cheap hotels and locations for buses. On the other hand this is the best lonely planet that I have seen regarding cultural sites. The drawings and descriptions of Bagan are a real plus if you ignore the sarcastic undertones of the writing. Also, this was my first lonely planet that starting falling apart with a week of normal ""travelling"" use. I don't think that there is a better guide book to Burma on the market. So you will probably be stuck buying this book and asking the locals a lot of questions when you are in Burma. Luckly the Burmese are very friendly and helpful!!!"
3,time for a rewrite,"Having just returned from a month in Myanmar with an LP guide others may find the following comments useful. The prices are woefully out of date. The main tourist centres are covered well but elsewhere the writers must have ran through in a hurry- how did they miss George Orwell's house in Thandwe?All the pages of chatter about FEC's only confuses everybody, pay US$200 per person and you can use them in hotels licensed for foreigners- not a big deal if you are there for a couple of weeks. If you a really on a budget the airport FEC desk might let you pay for only one person if you are a couple in return for a monetary present.I thought that this was probably one of the least useful LP guides."
1,Highly Derivative,I found this book highly derivative & unoriginal & would not recommend it to anyone.
5,A present for writers,"This CD is best for writers who like to hear music while crafting verse. Bach's Partitas, Preludes & Fugues are especially fine because of counterpoint. This is not what I would call mood altering music. Instead I find it helps one hear the cadences in writing through Bach's many different tempos, rhythms, beats and notes that form a unified symmetry interpreted, here, by Gould's genius. If your writing has orphaned words, this music not only clues you in, it also offers many alernatives for metrical revision."
3,Gould - another view of his interpretations,"Nobody can argue that Glenn Gould is not one of the foremost pianists of recent history. His interpretations are memorable and always carry his distinctive tone. However, some of his playing is rather radical, I suppose perhaps based on his eccentric nature. I e.g. don't agree with the WTK renditions, while the Goldberg Variations are his best. The thing to remember here is that Gould's playing is not mainstream Bach. It is something different, and not always - in my opinion - strictly 'correct' in a classical sense. The same applies for this volume."
3,"Lots of talent, but...","Gould's talent is unquestionable, and although the pacing is a little fast for my tastes, I still think this set is an excellent recording.However, my enjoyment of the work is seriously marred by the fact that Gould made a habit of humming along, quite audibly and in a not particularly pleasant voice. In some tracks, the humming is almost as loud as the piano. As a result, I think this set is great as background music, but not so good for sitting in a quiet room listening."
5,how will i get there,How will i get there if only lies reveal what i am realy feeling temptation has me going in circles confussion has me scared but i continue this journey that i am trying to conquer but shattered hopes have me failing haw far is it till i will feel right again help for i need you single me out and help me to suceede at stoping points people wait there but i want to be free to express my love for every single individual and to be able to excepted or learnj to exceptit.
2,Ho hum,"I'm tired of this notion that in order for a song to be a radio success, it has to be so bland that it will appeal to a wide audience. Witness ""Heaven,"" the latest beaten-to-death-on-the-radio hit by Los Lonely Boys. The boys sing decent harmonies, play their own instruments in heartfelt professional manner, and don't rock too hard so as not to turn off the over 30 crowd. They also send out sunny messages about heaven to appeal to middle America in this conservative age we live in. And the song is, well, not too bad, but... shlocky and boring as anything after two listens. I know it's not their fault the song is being overplayed on the air, but the general success of this kind of risk-free mediocrity reminds us once again how badly uncreative things have gotten in rock music since the day, so long ago, that the Beatles split up."
5,Enlightment,"Lloyd Ogilvie scores again with an insightful, intellectual, and uplifting explantion of the scriptures in languge understandable to the layman. Drawn from experiences during his many years as a leading, dynamic preacher, the vignettes present a credible account not only of the meaning of life, but also the meaning of living."
3,"Some good photos, some bad","I guess these were average photos, artistically, photojournalistically they are a bit better. The introduciton by Stefanie Rosenkranz was poorly done. (seems she worships the man, who, from her introduction seems to be either highly arrogant or majorly indifferent) it's okay at best"
2,not what I wanted,"I was looking for detailed stories about grasshopper ecology, not someone pontificating on the state of the world. The chapter about finding the lost migratory grasshopper was the best. Grasshoppers have fascinating behavior, and the author might have spent more time showing his love of grasshoppers by sharing some of what he has discovered."
4,This Camera is great.,"If you are not sure which one to buy, I would recomend this one. The quality is really good for it's price. My first Digital Camera was a Samsung Triple in one (Digital Camera, Video Cam + MP3 Player). This was the worse camera I ever bought. The FujiFilm 1300 is easy to use and has a fine LCD screen to preview pictures. The software is easy to use and USB connection is a plus. I even bought a new one as a X-mas present to my syster. GREAT CAMERA. Alex"
4,Fuji FinePix 1300 Digital Camera,"This is the first digital camera that I have ever owned. Within minutes of opening the box I was already taking pictures. The software was also easy to install and use. The only con that I have found is that it eats batteries like crazy, however I am told that most digital cameras do the same. So I would recomend you get rechargable batteries. This is a great camera for the money."
4,Excellent Beginner Camera!!!,"After my mom bought me a Sipix camera (terrible device), I went on a search for an affordable, quality camera. After reading several reviews from different sites, I decided to purchase this camera. It has been absolutely great and didn't cost an arm and a leg like the others. Highly recommend this camera for beginners"
5,My first and the best,After a going thru a lot of reviews I finally brought Fuji finepix 1300. The camera is very tiny and can be carried very easily. This is the best camera for the beginners with little knowledge about digital cameras. Compared to other digital cameras coping the images to the computer is made easy through USB. If you are using a XP operating system the computer automatically detects the camera. The camera comes with a 8MB smart media card (Not enough if you take picturs at high resloution --16 photos). The camera is compatible upto 128MB smart media (around 200 pictures)I am using this camera for the past one year. I have tested in all conditions and it worked great. Its a point and shoot camera and comes handy when you are on vecations. Need to have spare chargable baterries at all times. I will give a A+ to this camera at 1.3 megapixel category.
2,Bad Software,"I purchased the Fuji Fine Pix 1300 a couple of weeks ago. I have an AGFA 780 which works fine. The Fuji camera took great pictures. However, when I went to download the software, I kept getting an error message. I was not able to sucessfully load the software. I notice several other people are having the same problem. My computer is a Compaq 750 mhz with Windows 98. If I can get the software to work properly the camera would be great."
3,FINEPIX 1300,"I THINK THIS CAMERA WILL SERVE IT'S PURPOSE, BUT THE SMARTMEDIA CARD CARD IT REQUIRES IS RATHER PRICEY."
2,"Good pictures, bad build Quality","Takes good pictures, but the build quality is awful. I have owned this camera one year and it is falling apart. I have been pretty careful with it as well. It has a tempremental problem of powering off when it wants to or not switching on. I have heard similiar from other owners.It does take pretty good pictures, especially in low light, but the build quality has put me off fujifilm for good."
2,Only get it if you want to haul around extra batteries!!!,"This is NOT a very good camera for the price. If you leave the batteries in the camera, they are drained in a day. I finally figured out that the best way to go about it was to keep a separate bag with the batteries in it and put them in the camera before I use it. This is very annoying because then it wants you to re-set the time when you start it back up again. Not good for close-ups or low light. (I tried to use it to photograph my jewelry but got poor results.) Also, it does not have a zooming lens. For everyday shots of my family and friends outdoors or indoor with a flash, this is an OK camera. Still, I have found that you can get a much better product at a comparable price in the 35mm format, which you can now get ""developed"" and put on disc at most major film development outlets. And for only $50 - $100 more you can get a good quality digital Canon, Nikon, or Olympus that zooms and they might not have the battery problems."
5,Great starter camera,"I did not have any problems loading the software like some of the people who posted reviews here. As soon as I plug the camera into the usb port the Fuji software automatically downloads the pictures to their viewer software. The pictures are very good quality. On a epson 870 photo printer the results are excellent for a 4X6 print (I have not tried to print anything bigger). It is not a replacement for a 35mm camera with a zoom. I still use my Canon Sureshot 135 camera if I am shooting alot of pictures, like when I go on vacation, but if I only want to get some quick snapshots (which is most of the time) this is the camera I use. I can only get 10 pictures on the 8meg smartmedia card at the highest quality setting. I will probably get a 32meg or 64 meg card soon."
4,...a very useful camera!,"I bought two Fuji FinePix A101 a few days ago, and I have to say it is a good camera. It is accessible (cheap) and easy to use, one big advantage is that downloads pictures really fast.Maybe is not an impressive camera, but it is very useful."
1,A piece of rubbish,"I bought this camera on 9/21 and already the viewer through the LCD screen is broken.Can I take pics? Yes. I just can't view them on the screen before I take them anymore.Not that I really want to keep any of these pics. I know it's a cheap camera but the amount of white flecks on the jpgs I do get is ridiculous. No matter how still I am, they are almost always grainy and blurry.The only way I can clear them is by shrinking them five times smaller and working the levels in photoshop.Honnestly, this is the most regretable purchase that I ever made."
5,Virga Tears,"This book is fantastic! The relationship between the two characters reminds me of John Candy and Steve Martin in ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles."" It had me rolling! The imagery was quite powerful, and at times I felt as though I was traveling right alongside them! I could see the little toddler guiding the ""beast"" to safety, and the resolution, well, you just have to read the book to experience the profundity of ""The Final Ascent."" The eagle surely soars...This book is a must read.Shannon Karian"
5,Refreshing performance,Elgar's Chanson de matin is the very reason why I brought this CD. Midori makes her volin sings the Morning Song so beautifully. A refreshing performance which brightens up each morning for me.
4,Fantastic,Midori produces some amazing sounds out of her violin!You cant go wrong with Encore! Shes brilliant.
1,tarantula video,recently puchased this video and i wasnt to pleased with it.it lists that is is from 1989 but it is really from 1977.very outdated and is only 30 mins long.i guesse its ok but i wouldnt reccomend it.
3,Improper Review,It is impossible to rate an extended warranty before it is used. The rates appear to be a little high and it took forever and considerable hassle in securing the actual paperwork I hope that is not indicative of the future.
5,fANTASTIC,"This warrenty came to me on time. Amazon, worked with me when I had a mix up at th post office and sent out a new one promptly!"
1,Wranglers buttons,Loved look of jeans and they fit right but second time in dryer the button to fasten fell off. Not impressive at all. Sucks to spend moey then jeans break after 2 wears.
1,Horrible - my son didn't even get to wear them once!,"I ordered these on Amazon because I found out at the last minute that my son needed black pants for his play as his part changed to that of the penguin, lol! I didn't have time to run out to target to buy a pair, which is where I normally get all his jeans.The jeans arrived and I threw them in the washing machine on the light agitation/cold water setting so that my son could wear them on the following day for the play.The button fell off in the wash! I know that 5 year old boys can be hard on jeans, so I don't set the bar too high for endurance, but falling apart before he has even worn them is a new low!Save your time and money!"
5,Easily one of the top 5 Classical CD's of All Time,"This CD is arguably one of the best classical recordings ever, period. One single piano playing Bach's Goldberg Variations. The other reviewer hit it right on the head when he said it does not get any better than this. I cannot do this recording justice with words, so simply purchase it immediately."
5,1955 Original recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations by Glenn Gould,The clarity of the performance by Gould is astounding. Gould's touch is light and precise and conjures up the harpsichord for which this music was written.
2,Does not sound like Bach,"When I first played this CD I could not stand it and took it off.Then I forced myself to listen to it to the end, still no sparks in fact it hurt my ears listening to it.I am use to listening to Bach played by Richter, and if you like him you will not like Gould's Bach.I would highly recommend András Schiff's versionBach: Goldberg Variationsor my second choiceTatiana Nikolayeva's versionBach: Goldberg Variations."
5,The Marlon Brando of piano!,"These Goldberg formally inaugurated the auspicious debut of this well famed pianist. Until that time Bach was played with such impeccable austerity and intellectuality that literally became a shock to listen a very young man -23- challenging all the musical conventionalisms and old precepts which turned around the conceptual steadiness and serious formalism at the moment to play Bach at the piano.Gould made an incisive breakthrough and showed that the formality and the Dionysian spirit may habit together, without those bitter presumptions or austere poses.He impregnated the Goldberg variations with Mediterranean jubilee, effusiveness and radiant greenness. And this posture influenced a whole generation in all fields.So those Goldberg carry on its own trademark. A historical reference by all accounts.Indispensable collection piece."
4,good but not as good as the later recording,"This is Glenn Goulds debut recording and it is understandable why he became as famous as he did. There is no doubt that this (at that time) young man had all it took to play even the most demanding pieces, but sometimes he neglects the the feeling and soul of the music. It's almost as if he was too eager to show everybody how good he was. I would recommend this album to every bach fan but I would buy the second recording Gould made of the Goldberg variations first. I believe it was recorded in 1975, it has far more soul."
5,Gould's Old Testament,"I imagine it depends on how respectful of baroque conventions you are as to how you react to Gould's Well Tempered.For this listener, every facet of Bach's genius is presented compellingly to the well adjusted listener. There is a huge variety of tempi, dynamics, articulation and mood in this set which might not appeal to every taste. Plus some accepted conventions are challenged right from the first prelude (in staccato rather than the accepted legato).But Gould does not try to shock as he does in Mozart. For Bach he reserves some of his most spiritual playing of all, and rarely does it communicate so ripely.For me a desert Island performance of unsurpassed interest, probing and much beauty too."
5,Fascinating,"I was quite surprised to read other reviewer's comments about Gould not following Bach's 'intentions'. Given that there is one prelude with a tempo mark and almost no dynamic markings in the entire 48, it would be hard to find his intentions except by assuming that the tradition is 100 % accurate. I find this recording interesting, most of all because of the lack these days of originality. Gould was original, but that was not his goal. He had a connection with the music of Bach and felt that he had something to say with it that no one else had. It's refreshing to hear something so sincerely original as these unconventional renditions. The fugues are especially amazing. His control over each voice is nothing short of spectacular. I highly recommend this to anyone who is tired of hearing the Prelude in C major played the same way by everyone else."
1,Somebody help me understand this.....!,"I really don't get it. Except for the Goldberg Variations (which are excellent), every other recording I have heard of Gould's is to say the least shocking, this one included. I cannot believe how disastrous this CD is. There are a few moderately OK pieces, but a by far most of them sound either like a nervous breakdown or some other kind of exercise in contortion. I am sorry, but I just don't understand. Maybe he is purposely trying to make fun of the listener? who knows. Sorry Glenn, only one star."
2,For fans of Gould only,"One wonders, while listening to Gould's rendition of the venerable Well-Tempered Clavier, whether one is hearing more of Bach or of Gould?His highly personal performance - as articulated and ""refreshing"" as it sometimes is - should not by any means be the recording of choice for someone just getting acquainted with this masterpiece, or for one seriously interested in Bach's work: Gould's approach is far too idiosyncratic.There are many other recorded versions of the Well-Tempered Clavier (books I and II) on the market: Andras Schiff, Vladimir Feltsman, Jeno Jando, Frederich Gulda...; many of these offer Bach delivered in much more pianistic - and much less eccentric! - terms, than Gould."
1,Glen Gould sings Bach's WTC,"The rendition of the music itself is fine. The problem is that if you listen closely (or on headphones) you can actually hear Glen dramatically ""Tumm tum TA tumm"" -ing to himself as he plays (especially on the second disc), which is infuriating in and of itself, and then exacerbated by his less than melodious voice. The net effect is that it ruins the CD. This was a total waste of money, and I'd discourage anyone from buying this rendition of WTC."
1,Hot mess,"This recording is a wretched, hot mess. I honestly don't understand how anyone can consider Glenn Gould to have been a genius. I'd say that talented and quirky is a more accurate assessment.I'm a classically-trained pianist, and the music of the Baroque era is my specialty. His interpretations are downright goofy, and his playing is rather clunky and machine-like.But the worst part is that he sings and hums along with everything he plays in his weak, raspy voice. Even if he had a great voice, it would still not be welcome during the PIANO performance. This is The Well-Tempered Clavier, NOT The Well-Tempered Clavier with Raspy Vocal Solo (or any vocal solo, for that matter).My advice; don't waste your money on this recording."
5,Bach's individual fugual voices are crystal clear,"I laughed out loud reading the extreme range of these reviews; some reviewers felt a need to not only insult Gould but anyone who recommended the CD as well (!) Well, you can place me squarely in the ""You need this CD"" category; this is my favorite WTC performance, and one of my favorite classical recordings. Gould seperates and clarifies the individual fugal voices like no other; to me at least, listening to this is a Bach experience of the highest order."
1,Abysmal,"Gould's performance is deadpan to say the least, but this is not what really bothers me; he hums very loudly in the background of almost every single piece. I could understand the occasional breathing or foot pedal pickup by the mics, in fact this can even enhance the experience as a reminder that the piece is a malleable performance art, rather than just notes on a page. However, deliberately humming along off-pitch (while the delivery itself lacks any discernible artistic input besides automatism and tempo alterations) in a professional rendering is inexcusable and makes it very difficult to listen to.I sincerely don't understand how anyone who listened to this for more than 3 seconds could have given it a good review."
4,A Charm,"Shawn Hebb's ""Tourist"" is a good independent release. He writes catchy short pop tunes that have charm. The opening track is ""Some Things."" Shawn's breezy vocals front his one-man-band band arrangement that boasts a driving midtempo beat, ""I woke up this morning, my hand reached out to touch your hair; With some contemplation, I realized you were not there. You left last evening."" ""This May Be the Last Time"" is another pop gem where his fast-paced lyric is married to a catchy melody that jumps into your head and won't leave, ""There's got to be more than wasting my day in this dead-end job."" Hebb's voice is a bit thin, but serves the material well. While not all of the songs are equally memorable, the best of the bunch shows this young artist has potential. This is a charming release. Enjoy!"
3,its ok,"if you into old Disco i guess you be alright ,for me i wanted ""Side Effect"" Keep That Same Old Felling"" and i got what i wanted sound decent"
4,break it down! beat &#65533;em up!,"a very interesting and fresh remix approach to two classic cuts from the ""straight outta compton"" album.aphrodite has been involved in quite a number of remix and dj-set projects recently and the ""niggaz wit attitudes"" revival craze might have been one of the reasons to issue this maxi-single.not unlike ja-z, ice cube's vocals mingle well with the breakbeat rhythm and the result is a decent reinterpretation of a dope track.however, if you're not a fan of breakbeat - or ""drum & bass"", as the average raver calls it nowadays - refrain from purchasing this single. for those who're into crossing boundaries and expanding their musical horizons, on the other hand this cd is well worth a listen.cheers."
3,JUMBO BOBBY PINS,"I have always had long hair, standard sized bobby pins don't work too well. I had a few of the larger ones left, from 15 or so years ago. My search for extra large bobby pins, rendered me these. They do the job, but I must state, they are not quite as thick or as long as the original older ones. I also don't think the tips are coated as well or as much as the original and older ones. Thank goodness something similar is still around though! The quality is NO REFLECTION on who sells them!!"
5,Works pretty good so far.,I bought a bottle of this for the fun of it a few weeks ago. I must say the plants are looking better than ever. Even the slow growing ones like Anubias or Java Ferns have never looked this robust and I've had these plants for years. Mix it with the Seachem Flourish iron supplament and I think you'll be impressed what your plants can do. I use a eye dropper to add some of both daily.
5,A good handbook on Biblical prophecy...,"The ascendance and assumption of power by the Antichrist is the subject of Mark Hitchcock's book ""Is the Antichrist Alive Today?"" Short and concise (105 pages), Hitchcock gets straight to the point by referencing Biblical prophecy and providing his commentary on the matter. Given its brevity, this would be a good book for a Bible study to focus upon, shoring up knowledge of the subject of end-times prophecy.Definitely worth the time and effort!Britt GilletteAuthor of ""Conquest of Paradise: An End-Times Nano-Thriller"""
4,Short but Concise and Well-Written,"I bought this book and was glad to see a refreshing change compared to other books I've read. America is simply not in the Bible. The author does a careful job of avoiding foolish speculation. In the end, he believes the rapture is the key to the downfall of America. That answer will not convince everyone that it's true but I believe he is right. This book is a must-read, especially if you are not up to speed on the end times because the author gives enough information without going into complicated details."
4,Very good..,Mark covers everything there is to know about the Antichrist in just a hundred pages. Even the very new believer will learn something here.
2,Too basic,"Nothing that a person versed in prophecy wouldn't already know. Very simplistic and terse. Only new concept I gained from this book is his idea that since the time of the Fall, satan in every generation always selects a suitable candidate to emerge as the anti-christ, from Nimrod to Napoleon...because satan knows from scripture that God will give him an opportunity to unite the world under one dastardly leader, but he doesn't know when that time will come. In other words, since the evil one is kept in the dark regarding the time the Father has set for the Day of the Lord or the Great Tribulation, satan needs to be constantly on guard."
1,Bad crafstmanship,"Three days after receiving this item the swivel belt clip fell apart and one side of the case is splitting. I contacted the company, who sold me the item, via email (over a week ago) and still no response. Would not recommend this item"
5,Great lens (if you can find one),"I bought this lens used several years ago to shoot with my 30D. I've since moved up to a 5D and a 1Ds mark IIIt was an impulse buy at a local shop (I went in for a $30 reflector). I don't pull it out much, but this thing is with me almost every time I go to Fenway Park and I have gotten amazing shots. When the Bruins were honored by the Red Sox and brought the Stanley Cup to the park, I could read names on the cup in pictures I shot from 50 feet away. Yes, it's heavy to lug around for a few hours, but so worth the effort."
2,"Questionable ""facts""",George Karl as a coach in the NBA has a great deal of influence on the careers of any young man the he deals with. It is really too bad that he chooses to be creative when he decides to pass along information about one of them. One paticular incident in the book is about my son and me. His recollection of this incident is so far from what actually happened that I had to read it several times to believe what was written. It is just too bad that a man of this stature decides to be so petty.
3,Good but not great,"This has some nice early chapters on normal marrow, but as a general pathologist, I don't find this text nearly as useful as Foucar's book."
3,"Love the hat, but figuring out sizing bit of hassle.","The hat is cute and looks so adorable on my grandson. I'm glad it fit him, but determining if it would by the sizing given was a bit of a hit-and-miss proposition."
2,Not Comfortable at All!,"I bought this chair because of the price and look of it. After using it at work for the past couple of weeks I'm noticing that it is not as ergonomic as I would have liked, I'm constantly sliding because of the plastic and the back piece is terribly uncomfortable.The plus side was that it was super easy to assemble and isn't terrible when used in small doses. I would NOT recommend this chair for people who plan to sit in it for hours at a time on a daily basis."
1,Don't buy this item!,"This item arrived defected, after it was assembled, the settings for the chair height would not hold. then the plastic handle broke off. So I contacted amazon to return the damaged product and I could not disassemble it. so there is no way possible for it to fit in any box that I have .The amazon rep told me to tape the ticket to the chair and it will be picked up. Not true UPS does not take anything that is not properly packaged in a box. Second call to amazon, they are so sorry, but I still will have to get a box large enough,somewhere and package it. So a sledge hammer helped to disassemble. Don't buy anything that will not come apart from Amazon."
2,Read This Before You Buy!,"I've had this chair for about a month. It works pretty well for drawing, computer, and sitting at the workbench in my workshop. However, do not lean back and prop your feet up on the counter top with this chair! I did that today and the back popped off. I almost fell off the chair height-end to its full potential. Had that been the case, I would have cracked my head on the concrete floor. As long as you don't lean back on this chair. You are fine."
5,Still looks good,I already have this item for over a year or even two. it still works and is as described. Even though I am beyond the maximum weight recommendation it even holds me. It is used at a packing station in our warehouse and does its job already much longer than originally expected.
3,bar stool review,"the stool its alright but one of the four legs came broken, i realize it when i get it out of the box, it didnt affect the functioning but it seems bad if you get a look to its legs, every thing was alright exept for the broken les"
2,"Very plasticky, but still sturdy","This stool is mostly plastic, but surprisingly sturdy. I don't detect any flexing at all when I sit in it and lean back, and I'm about 180 lbs.The only flaws I can find with it are minor:1. the base arrived with some of the chrome paint chipped off near the feet areas.2. I have to re-adjust the height occassionally--like once a week. Not sure if I'm accidentally hitting the lever or it's just slowly sagging.UPDATE 1: after 2 months, a part of the seat broke off, resulting in the backrest not staying up. I've uploaded a picture of the breakage. Flash furniture support sent me a replacement seat in a timely manner.UPDATE 2: after 1 month with the new seat, the plastic broke again at the same point. I can no longer recommend this stool. This is obviously a design flaw."
5,very artistic and easy to assemble,I bought two stools for my kitchen bar. They arrived in time and were very easy to put together (without any additional tools). They look good and are very comfortable to sit on. I am very happy about them.
4,Not the pink color displayed on the picture,"I just got this bar stool. The color is not exact as the picture here, but I like it too. It's like dark rose actually."
5,Great Stool,"I bought this stool for my studio. It is a good value, easy to put together, made of quality materials, good looking, easy to clean and comfortable. I love it. It would be great as a stool for a bar or whatever. My only suggestion would be to include wheels."
1,"Broke Twice, Second Time After Warranty","One would expect a tractor seat chair to be durable. This however is not the case.Both times the chair broke the piston that moves the chair up and down busted. The first time within a week and the second time after the warranty expired. (figures)In the picture the seat appears to be made of metal, but is not. It is made of fairly bendable and potentially breakable plastic. If one were to sit back in it without care the back could snap pretty easily. The painted plastic also scratches without being rough on it at all.Major Disappointment. Not recommended."
1,To light for this chair,"I got this chair in the mail today.It took me about 5-10 minutes to put together and it looked great. I shook it a bit to make sure it wouldn't fall apart and it is sturdy enough. It wobbled a bit when i sat in it because of my carpeted floor. Next i found I couldn't raise the chair without standing up first. Not a real problem, it happens with most of chairs i own. After than i found that i am to light to make this chair go back down. The cylinder is to strong and my 110 pounds is not enough weight to move it. That being said either is my brothers 160 pounds, he is heavy enough though to make it about half way down.I hope returning this chair is as easy as it was to put together.Pros:Sturdy chairlooks greateasy to put togetherCons:Wobbles on a carpet floorCylinder is to strong and the chair will not function properly for anyone UNDER 170 poundsThe seat back is a little low"
1,Arrived Broken,"Product arrived broken out of the box. Easy return through Amazon. Not willing to try it again. If the product was broken before use, not sure if it would hold up."
3,Not very comfortable and you cannot lean back on it at all.,"While the product is easy to put together and very cheap, the problem is that the entire chair's strength to hold up the seat back is based on one screw. If you relax at all, you are at risk to break the back off."
2,You get what you pay for.,"The chair is attractive, but that's about it. The back rest offers no support and isn't even high enough for a person of average height to lean back comfortably if it did support his or her weight.The mechanism that sustains the chair's height failed after one day of use, and I am currently waiting for a replacement part. I would just return the chair, but the shipping cost is deducted from the refund. Being that it was around $60 to begin with, I'm not going to bother if all I'll get back is $10-$20.Aesthetically, the chair's ""bucket"" seat is awkward. The ridges for your thighs are deep and cascade to the back, making you slide back. Since there's no real back support, you have to overcompensate by leaning forward more.Don't buy this chair. Pay a little more and get a legitimate, well made, comfortable chair."
1,incomplete Package,"The chair came, everything is fairly straight forward and simple minus the small detail it did not come with any of the screws to put it together. So I have 4 pieces to a great bar stool that I'm sure if they were put together would be quite useful. I can't find any way to contact the company to get the screws so this could very well be my own short coming or just a lack of knowledge."
4,Pretty!,This is a nice stool. It's sturdy and comfortable except for the fact that is very slippery! It is in my shop that has minimal heat in the winter so it feels like a bit of a balancing act to stay in the seat. Perhaps this summer it will be different. I like it.
5,Perfect for a Teenagers room,"It was an awesome addition to my 13 year olds teen room. The price made me nervous that it would not be good quality, but it is sturdy and the colors are bright and vibrant. She loved it!"
3,Decent chair,"Putting it together was simple, however I thought the materials would be metal and not plastic.Holding up so far."
4,I was pretty happy but it did break,"I leaned back a lot when using the chair. Eventually the part that attaches the back rest to the bottom of the chair broke. Now it is just a stool hah. This was after a couple of months of use. I was still happy with the product, just be warned about putting to much pressure leaning back."
5,Works Well,I own the MK 770-EXP saw and needed the protractor for a bunch odd angle cuts on a project. It worked well and I would recommend it.
3,I will be trading mine in for another....,"I have had mine for about a year now and was originally impressed, but over time have become increasingly irritated. I agree with the other two posters about their complaints, which have become my biggest issues. The lens cover if moved ever so slightly will shut the camera down and by the time you move it back and take the shot, you've lost your picture. My second issue is also the time it takes between hitting the button and it actually snapping the shot. It seems forever and with toddlers they've done moved on and the picture is actually of them moving away. It seems that once you hit the button, it would snap that instance, but that is not the case. Also, by the time you turn the camera on, open the lens cover, wait for the lens to come out and snap, the subjects (in my case toddlers) are done. lol~I have lost many, many good shots over the past year and the time issue is my biggest. I need more of a one shot camera that just snaps, no delays etc."
4,Love this camera!,"This camera is very simple to operate and takes great pictures! They are very sharp and the color is great. It doesn't seem to eat up batteries like some other cameras I owned. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the LCD screen is kind of useless in bright light, and sometimes there is a delay between the time you press the shutter button and when it takes the picture, but I heard that happens with some other cameras too. Still, I am very, very pleased with this camera."
4,Excellent value,"Just a few words to say that I recently bought this camera as I have been after one for a long time.The price in the UK was good and the features this camera contains are everything an amateur like myself needs.I have been able to take so many pictures,touch them up when downloaded and now family all over the world can see an excellent quality picture seconds after it's ben taken.I would recommend this to anyone who has a budget to keep to.Don't go and spend $500 when you can get this for 300."
1,"It takes pictures, but you can't see them","For this being my first digital camera, I am disappointed. The preview and downloading switch gets jamed. I am currently sending it in to the manufacturer for repair. I have only had it for 2 months."
4,fuji cameras,"Most of the Mx cameras if not all do not have a video out capability, such as allowing one display on a tv. Most competition do."
4,Good Quality And A Good Price,"I did a lot of looking on-line before deciding to buy this product, and I'm happy with my decision.Good product, good price, and delivered in a timely manner."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM !!!!!!!,"Newsgroups are full of HORROR stories about this piece of junk. Cisco (Linksys) should be ashamed of themselves for continuing to ship these. Many of them don't work right out of the box, and the rest will soon fail. I think I'll stop buying Cisco products as well, hmmmm.LanceLink, MCSE, MCT, CCA, CCNA"
1,Bad Idea,"This product has been nothing but pain due to all the troubleshooting required. Dropped packets, daily resets... etc. Countless horror stories exist elsewhere on the internet to make a new season of ""Tales from the Crypt"" (Tech version of course). While it may seem like a bargain compared to other high end devices, the time spent in troubleshooting, and the poor quality of the product as a whole will lead to a higher cost of ownership in the long run."
1,As bad as could be,I've had the same problem as others - unit turns itself off for no apparent reason; connection goes on and off sporadically.
1,Avoid this access point,"I bought this to support just 3 users in a section of a small branch office that was too cumbersome to hardwire. Unless you want to blow your credibility as a network admin, don't put this device in your network.It continually drops connections. I have the users trained to unplug this thing when it decides to quit working which has been at least twice a week, but now it's every day, sometimes twice. How embarrassing is that to have your users have to unplug one of you devices because Linksys didn't even have the commonsense to let you reboot it from the web interface??I've only kept this thing around because I've been waiting for a firmware upgrade. (Current version is 1 year old at the time of writing) Can't wait any longer, I'm about to lose my job. Worst network component ever."
2,Super Cliche,"The story-line and characters of this anime are incredibly cliche. If they make one more anime about Japanese high school student reincarnations of ancient warriors with elemental super-powers, I think the world might explode. You have the hot-headed main character with light powers (so obviously, his ongoing enemy will have shadow powers, duh), the niave and spunky girl character, etc. This anime also pulls a big no-no by having two of the main girl characters purple-haired so you can't even tell them apart. The only reason I'm not giving this show 1 star is because there are some cool moments during the battle scenes. One of the enemies is a giant black dot and before you can make jokes about how pitiful the budget must have been, you appreciate how cool the darn thing looks as it cut through buildings, swallowing people up."
1,Like having your time wasted?,"Wow, very disappointing. The character development is extremely weak, the action is mediocre, the plot is convoluted and the whole thing leaves you with ""who cares"" echoing through your brain until you want to scream. I've seen over 100 DVD's worth of anime and this one I can truly say is the worst. If you have seen anything decent like Bebop, Trigun, Escaflowne, X - tv series, Evangelion, or Full Metal Panic then you will HATE this. Once you've seen anime that people actually took pride in making you will never be able to stomach the likes of 10 Tokyo Warriors. Don't waste your valuable time and money."
4,Nice model also parts for regular romeo,"This is a very nice model of an unusual subject. The kit builds very well with little filler needed. Some cutting is required to fit the missle enclosure. This was my first model from Trumpeter and I have buying other kits from them ever since. I got/built it a few years ago. This version contained parts for both the SSG and the SS version (which is also available in its own kit).It is really more a three star kit but since it had the parts (not instructions) to build the SS version I gave it an extra star for value. This is a nice addition to a collection to show the evolution of the modern SS as it's lineage from the German type XXI is clearly evident. Built it is about 21""long."
5,Outstanding Christmas music!,"A truly outstanding Christmas music video despite it's age, with many of my favorite artists. I have been a huge fan of Mr. Prey's for years, and Edita Gruberova's performance is totally captivating! Wish this was on DVD..."
3,Is Crypto Star just another ska band?,"Crypto Star's record label markets them as ska, but their new album Time actually has a much jazzier feel to it than one would expect. Their songwriting is fairly good, but the production and mixing leaves much to be desired - on many of the songs, the vocals and guitars (usually heavily distorted for some reason) are buried deep in the mix, leaving the listener annoyed and disoriented."
1,"tasteless, not many funny jokes",This book was very disappointing. Most jokes involve sex in some way and most are inappropriate and offensive. I had to read many pages before getting a laugh. The creativity level is zero. Not worth it.
1,<Yawn....>,"People used to think this kind of thing was funny, huh? The word ""puerile"" comes to mind followed by ""mind-numbingly awful."" What was the person who gave me this book thinking, homocide?Perhaps it would be funny if I read it in Carmen Miranda drag. Read it at your own risk. You've been warned."
3,Hit and miss,"This book reads like the ""Airplane"" and ""Naked Gun"" movies play... throw enough attempts at humor at you and SOMETHING is going to make you laugh. With 5000 jokes, you WILL laugh, and laugh often, but you may not find it to be worth wading through the sex and profanity to get to the clean funny stuff (although if you've ever seen a Friar's Club Roast on Comedy Central, the blue material won't come as a great surprise)."
5,excellent; for all occasions and subjects,"Non-stop laughs if you're smart enough to understand the jokes. Has jokes on circumsision, sex, childhood, holidays, and much more. Sorry to say I can only give it 5 stars. If you want to be the life of the party get this book!"
4,exciting,"I am a German pupil of English in the 13th form who had to read The Spirit Caller in class in 1999. I found the novel easy to read because Hager uses a lot of direct speech and short main clauses which make it easy to understand. The characters are described with a lot of details. Those are helpful to visualize the persons. I believe the novel is exciting, because the reader is hooked by the plot. You get to know almost nothing about Talia Wind's murderer at first. The investigator Molly Bearpaw has got several suspects, but the murderer is only found at the very end. It is interesting, too, that the storyline has got several parts. Molly Bearpaw sees her father for the first time after 25 years plus the unravelling of Wind's gruesome death."
4,passion and crime among the Cherokees,"I believe this novel is very interesting. It contains elements of love, crime, Cherokee culture and a lot of mysterious details. Hager vividly describes the lifestyle and the tradions of the Cherokees. Most of the details taken from culture and geography which are used in the novel are realistically drawn and not ficticious. There are numerous dialogues which help us to understand the characters' motivations. The plot of the story is full of suspense. Until the end you never know who the murderer is. The mysterious element is provided by the ghost in the library. I believe the novel is a good one because it contains so many different topics."
4,fun to read,"I'm a student in my senior high school year at Hilda-Gymnasium, Koblenz, Germany. We read the novel The Spirit Caller by Jean Hager in class (8/-11/99) and got the novel via amazon.com really inexpensively and very fast. First I was not really interested in the novel because our teacher told us that the story is about contemporary Indians in Oklahoma and I thought that would be extremely boring. After browsing through a few pages of the novel, though, my attitude changed absolutely. The story of Molly Bearpaw's life and the answer to the crime captivated me, so that I could not stop reading. Piece by piece the reader slily gets important information which helps to uncover the secret, but until the very last chapter you do not get to know who the murderer is and what happened. By was very rewarding to read this novel instead of always tackling difficult texts because it was easy to understand, we learned something and it was fun to read at the same time!"
3,likeable character,"I like the novel by Jean Hager. In my opinion it is interesting and realistically written. There are many dialogues so you can really 'see' the different characters and come to conclusions as to how they are. Molly Bearpaw is a likeable character. Hager shows contemporary Cherokee life through Molly's eyes. Due to Hager's knowledge regarding the Cherokeee Nation she pays meticuluous attention to geographic and cultural details. Her novel is full of local colour. Throughout the novel the author shows us Native American traditions and beliefs. Nevertheless, her novel is exciting, too. Until the very end you can never guess who the murderer is. It is like in Agatha Christi's detective novels. Hager knows how to put a good plot together, therefore I think the novel is a good one."
3,certainly not water proof,"This bag is cute and well made but the inside has a ""water proof"" liner- my daughters sippy cup leaked and now I have to figure out a way to wash it. Other then that its nice."
1,Has anyone noticed,"that, according to this page, in this version, Fugue No. 22 has been cut to 16 seconds?Is that true?Could it have been mentioned in the reviews?"
5,Works Great,Great Product. I use Windows 7 and it works great. I do not use the sleep function or Hibernate on ether one of my computers so it is not a problem.
2,Great until it breaks,"The only issue I had until about a week ago is that the cables they sell to go with this switch do not support DVI-D connections directly. You have to use a DVI-I to DVI-D adapter to plug them into the computer side (DVI-D ports are very common on built in video, but much less common on stand alone video cards). It is not ideal but the converters are available pretty cheaply here and elsewhere so it is not a major issue.Then all the sudden it just broke one day while it wasn't in use. The USB just stopped working after about 2 years. So now I am back to moving cables between computers or having multiple mice. Given the high price of this switch, having to replace it every couple years is not acceptable. If it didn't break it would probably be 4 stars. Not perfect, but a decent option. But I can't recommend it as is."
2,Doesn't support VGA,"Product is great with newer computers, but it's features are completely misleading when it comes to older computers with only a VGA video port. Apparently, it only supports DVI-i, rather than DVI-d. DVI-d has the ability to use that dvi-to-vga adapter, whereas DVI-i only supports digital. When trying to hook in an older computer, this switch becomes absolutely useless."
2,Only seems to work with DVI video cards,"This works just fine with my primary PC, which has a DVI video card. However, I couldn't get the display to work with my older pc, notebook, or netbook. They all have video cards with SVGA out, so I used a SVGA to DVI adapter thinking it would work. It would have been nice if the product description or the product manual mentioned this."
1,can't handle power losses - active ports fry on powerloss,"I have just fried my second of this model. When power is lost to the unit it kills the video portion of the switch. no signal.I'm not sure if it's a surge of current from the AC/DC transformer from inductance or some capacitor internal in the unit, frying the port, but every time there is an unscheduled power outage, the ports I'm using at the time fry. so I would switch to the other ports I haven't used yet. now they're fried too.Avocent replaced the first one without question. It happened again over the weekend and I tried everything to get it to work. I couldn't. Their customer service is great, but I needed to get some work done this weekend and couldn't because of this item failing.it's better than the IOgear one, but if you have power outages for any reason, kiss it goodbye or buy a CPS constant power supply so it NEVER loses power. you decide."
2,Video switching is great. USB (inc keyboard and mouse) is not.,"I am using this on my macbook pro, a imac24 and a PC connecting a 24"" Dell FPD. The video switching is great. USB is so bad that I have stopped using the built in USB switch. I have read the forums and tried many different things, but the USB just sometimes disappears. Sometimes they keyboard only registers every other keystroke. All I have plugged into the USB is the keyboard and the mouse. I am not satisfied with the USB switch at all."
1,Consistently horrible,"I have been using these things for years. When they work, they work. When they don't, it's a nightmare.I am sitting here with four of these, 2 ea. two port, 2 ea. four port. All behave differently.The one that does not work at all is brand new.I am sending it back.And I am never, ever going to buy an Avocent product again."
1,Docked Laptop Users Beware,"This particular KVM doesn't work well with laptops connected to docking stations. I've had other Avocent KVMs in the past and never had an issue. I should've paid attention to the other reviews out there regarding this particular model.When I contacted Avocent's Tech Support regarding the problems I was having, it took over a week before they told me that they had no solution because the problem lied with the docking stations and not the KVM itself. I was also told it works perfect with desktop machines. Then they simply closed the ticket without offering a refund.Poor product and poor customer service."
2,hates sleeping computers,"This switch works pretty well until one of your computers goes to sleep or the display sleeps, then you have to power cycle the switch to get it to display anything after waking up the computer or display.Same problem occurs when you just turn on the computer.Windows is especially bad about thinking it has no display if you boot Windows when it is not the selected computer.If your computer never sleeps and never sleeps the display, then the switch works fine. Otherwise look for something else."
2,doesn't work with Thinkpad Advanced Dock,"i hooked up one 1600x1200 LCD to 2 computers: a desktop with nvidia 6150 integrated graphics and a laptop (lenovo T60p in a Thinkpad Advanced Dock). the desktop worked fine, the laptop could not detect the presence of the monitor, so it displayed a blank screen. a gefen switch works fine in the same situation."
3,Barely Adequate,"It does the job. But ....Major peeve:If you are not switched to the graphics card until the boot completes, the screen stays blank.It does not appear to isolate the computer from the peripherals. You must have a keyboard / mouse attached. A ""stupid"" emulation until a real device is attached would be more useful.Minor peeve.You can only move the USB and Audio connections by moving ""syncing"" the audio and/or the usb to the keyboard and monitor. You cannot shift them independently.Don't bother buying the avocent cable. It isn't a single unified cable, it is three seperate cables."
4,Good book for every one,"Some books are good for mathematicians, some books are good for managers. This book is different. Williams did a good job to combine both mathematic and application perfective in a single book. Even you have only high school background, this book is readable. For senior researchers or grad students or strong math background person, this book is still enjoyable to recall your fundamental of math modeling. The references are not quite updated, however. Also, this book should added some current optimization tools. Even though the title is model building, not solving, it won't be harmful to have the metaheuristics (only introduction) or KKT."
3,Fun but Doesn't Last Long,This is a cute toy. Got stepped on once and the carton was destroyed beyond repair. Eggs are wood which is fun. The carton is realistic but the eggs are much smaller than any egg would actually be. My daughter had fun with this toy. You just need to be careful with it. Don't play on the floor.
4,Very cute egg set!,"I agree with other reviews that these eggs are small - I wouldn't recommend them for children who still put things in their mouths!!My son is 4 and they're a perfect addition to his play food. I like that they are wood and unstained. The egg carton they come in is adorable and I cautioned my son that it is very fragile so if he likes it, treat it gently. The carton has survived for a month so far but I have put it up when other kids come over."
2,haba eggs,Was very disappointed in the size of these eggs. Not very realistic unless you like quail eggs. I think they were a bit too expensive and probably would not buy them again. My daughter played with them maybe 2 times before she lost interest.
2,#HashtagReviews,"#theperfectsizeforakidtoswallowNOTE: This is part of the #hashtag review program: delivering insights on the overall product experience, without the self-entitlement."
3,Beware....eggs are small,These eggs are pretty...shiny...and smooth. But they are a little larger than a Robin's egg. Not life size chicken eggs at all. And the egg cartoon is made of cardboard. I bought these to go in my kiddo's toy kitchen that she will be getting for Christmas...so I'm not sure yet if the size will be an issue for her. I don't expect the carton to last long though. Pity. :(
2,Six Wooden Eggs,"Loved all the Melissa & Doug food! Only exception is this one. from the pictures that were given to view the product, I expected there to be different color and sizes of eggs inside. There were only 6 small white eggs. ??? But I was mostly satisfied."
2,eggs too small,"The eggs (like all Haba toy foods) are too dang small! pop right in the little ones mouth, so make sure to give to older kids."
3,I'm returning them!,"Cute carton, but the eggs are very small! Too small, I consider them a choking hazard. We've had them for almost a week and they are just too small. I'm returning them and buying full size eggs. They are white, but the size is not remotely realistic. I'm not willing to risk it. I wish Haba didn't make such small items."
4,16 Month Old Boy,"We bought these for our 16-month old son. I would have liked to see a more heavy-duty carton, it was cardboard just like ""real"" egg cartons. The wooden eggs are great - however it would have been even better if they were larger, just like ""real"" eggs. They are a little too small for the compartments in the container. Overall - we like it. It will help with counting and sorting skills."
4,very cute toy,My boys really like this toy. The carton didn't last long but I figured that when I bought it. very cute toy.
2,Eggs are too small,"The egg carton is life-size, but the eggs, themselves, are tiny. Not only is the unrealistic size very dissapointing (kids know the difference), but the small size makes it difficult to pull them out of the carton. The shape of the egg isnt as good as it could be, either. I am going to return my purchase."
4,Time To Eat!,"I purchased this product for my daughters' play kitchen. Both of them have enjoyed it. The product brings more realism to their ""cooking."" With this purchase, you get a half dozen wooden eggs in a cardboard carton. I only wish that the size of the actual egg was a bit larger, but they seem to fit well in a toddler's hands. Just keep an eye out for a toddler's mouth!"
3,eggs are cute but carton is flimsy,"The eggs are cute. Small my one year old daughter can get them in her mouth. Not recommended for small children or kids that like to put things in their mouths. My son likes to ""Boil"" them and make hard boiled eggs for us. The carton they come in is just like regular egg cartons and it will tear easily. Ours is still in ok shape and we have had it for a year but only because we put it up after we play with it EVERY time otherwise it would get steped on and it would be ruined."
1,Don't waste your money on these eggs!,"I wish I would have read the negative reviews before purchasing - these eggs are TINY - they look like eggs from a sparrow or some other kind of bird, definitely not the size or shape of chicken eggs! They have a really weird smell too - almost like wet elmer's glue. I am returning them right away."
1,not worth the money,"I bought this over a year ago for my toddler. The carton tore apart within a week. The eggs do not look at all real. They're little wooden ovals painted white, and they are tiny. This is a total waste of money, it's absurd they charge this much. The carton is not even as durable as a real egg carton. Don't waste your money!"
2,eggs are too small beware/worried grandma,I bought these eggs for my grandson and decided not to give it to him. I feel they are too small. He is one of 11 grandchildren ages newborn to 9. The egg is smooth rounded and could easily obstruct an airway. I wish they would redesign it. I usually love their products but I feel this one is a safety hazard.
2,egg carton,"The carton of eggs are very cute,the eggs are made of wood, but the carton and the paper that comes with it tore up the first day. I think the carton should be made of something else. I would not recommend this for any child less than 6 years of age. I bought it for my 15month old grandaughter. It is not made for rough play."
2,"Carton not durable, eggs too small","The egg carton is very similar to a real, cardboard egg carton, so it is not very durable. My 3 year old got this a few days ago and already accidentally ripped the lid off from it. The eggs inside are very durable as they are wooden, but they are smaller than a real egg size so they don't look realistic. They do not fit in the carton well because of their size - the carton is the same size as a real one, and the eggs are small and jiggle around inside it. I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it."
2,Not as expected,The egg carton itself is not very durable. For a toddler this carton will not last long. The eggs appear larger in the picture than they actually are. The actual egg itself is quite a bit more pointy than rounded like a real egg. The size and shape of the egg was very disappointing.
3,Decent Eggs,"They are okay, kids love it because they are eggs. You can see swirls from the wood so it's not painted white (solid) just glazed & they are on the smaller size. About 1/2 the size of a large egg. Carton is flimsy so must put it away or kids will rip it apart."
4,Music For the Soul,I don't know very much about Andrew Peterson but when I heard the song The Chasing Song I knew I had to hear more. Andrew Peterson has a voice that will bring you to your knees. Thoughtful and reflective lyrics that drive to the heart. Rich Mullins came instantly to mind the first time I heard Andrew Peterson. The song Rise and Shine has to be my favorite. Was it the fury of God's anger or was it the fury of His love. Wow! Words are hard to find to express that one.
5,Most artistic musician of a lifetime!,Andrew Peterson is one of the most talented singer/songwriter's of his day. His music is unique and the words even more so. I give this CD and all of his CD's 5 stars!
2,Ths book is an edited version.,"This book is good, but has been heavily edited.I would recommend against buying this book, but instead buy ""The Soul Of an Indian"" Charles Alexander Eastman (Ohiyesa); published by University of Nebraska Press; ISBN: 0803267010.Ohiyesa puts his spirituality in simple words without getting bogged down in ceremonies by rote, and dogma.I HIGHLY recommend the writings by Ohiyesa. Just not this heavily edited version.I encourage questions and comments via E-Mail. Two Bears."
2,"Great performance, lousy recording","Gould's performance on this CD is really impressive, but the recording is AWFUL to the point where I have difficultly listening to it, even on this supposedly remastered edition. Through most of the pieces, you can hear mumbled voices in the background, and there are frequently bits of static, clicks, hisses, etc. Listening to this disc with headphones is a painful experience. I may keep it as a reference for my own playing, but I doubt I will listen to this one much for pleasure."
3,"Great music, great performer, terrible piano!","Sony has in the liner notes an explanation about the technical problems with the piano, which they call hiccups, and their reluctance to release the recordings against Gould's insistence. I find the problem very annoying, it's like listening to a great performance at an out-of-tune piano; they couldn't have done it later with an acceptable instrument? I realize that Gould was very eccentric, but...My suggestion is for Bach and Gould fans to purchase this used or at a discount price, it's still worth it for the music but not at full price."
1,Get Leonhardt instead,"The most apalling thing to me is that I just typed in ""Bach Inventions"" on Amazon.com and this is the first album ... as if there were no other albums to buy. And it makes me even sadder because I spent a whole semester analyzing these, and though my teacher brought out so many wonderful aspects of these inventions, he would then turn and play Glenn Gould, who never articulated any of the points we discussed in class! I realize that Glenn Gould was a great self-promoter and spoke as if anyone who opposed him was an idiot (which is a great way to make people think you know more than they do!) but in fact, it's obvious that he never bothered to look at a copy of CPE Bach's book on keyboard playing, or he'd be embarrassed at these interpretations. If you want to get more out of these, and really HEAR the interesting ideas in each piece, try Gustav Leonhardt's recording."
4,"""My Life in Poetry"" by Donald Suckstroff","I had a chance to relax and read through twice,this work by D. Suckstroff.I found it is easy reading and leaves quite a bit to the personality and imagination of the reader. I have had the pleasure of talking to the author, who I find to be intelligent yet not overbareing, an indivivual who is real and down to earth. A fansinating man of hard(trying)and kind(lite-hearted) adventures and loves sharing them in his own unique way. I would recommend the book for anyone who has interest in new american poets or just likes care free reading. I believe you will enjoy it because this book(My Life in Poetry) can be offered to so many on many different levels."
2,Home Ec - A history,"This text is the required reading for a class, The History and Philosophy of Family and Consumer Science, at Immaculata University, Immaculata Pennsylvania. Gratefully, the instructor does not have enough time in the semester to have us read every chapter. The book is a series of essays that jump around and are not chronological. I needed a dictionary by my side in order to understand some of the terminolgy used throughout the text. Most of the students in class agreed that the book is pretty difficult to comprehend."
3,Good and Bad,"This is a mediocre ""set-up"" cd. The majority of the audio set-up utilities are not explained well either on the dvd itself or in the included text. There are minimal to no directions given on using the setup tools. The setup section is a waste of time. It does have some pretty cool audio demonstrations though, for DTS and Dolby Digital (5.1 & 2.0). It's a good comparison DVD for the 5.1 surround setup. You can definately determine the superior sound quality of DTS over DD. There are some interesting videos (i.e. ""implosions"")included as well, not anything you have to see more than once or twice though. One thing not mentioned in the stats on this title, is that it is a double disk set. Hope this helps!"
3,A fun toy for someone new to DVD,"This is a neat DVD to play with, especially if you are new to DVD's and Dolby Digital surround. I thought the setup disk was pretty easy to use. Each test has a good description and explanation. I found it to be useful. I would have given a higher rating, but I experienced some technical problems with the setup disk. Anytime I would try to go into DTS audio setup it would kick me out for 'Parental Control Violation'. I never did figure it out, so I just used Dolby Digital 5.1.The demo disk is quite good. I really like being able to directly compare DTS, DD 5.1, and Pro Logic. The difference is quite amazing. If I could have rated the two disks separately I would have given this one 4 stars."
4,"Nice demonstrations, but confusing at the begining.....","This new version comes in two discs, the set up tools and the audio-video demonstration. At the beginning you can get lost easily since there is no manual or clear instructions (the only instructions you have are on the disc). But don't worry after playing for a while with it, you will master the navigation. It has almost everything you can see on a dvd, it is good for you, if you want to know what a DVD is capable of, or if you want to impress your relatives or friends. But what it is true, is the extraordinary demonstrations of DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1, here you discover why DTS stands for.... the MAXIMUM QUALITY in sound."
5,"Very cool set of tools and demos, ...","... I've had a great experience with this DVD and found it very helpful. The tests and calibration utilities worked perfectly and even helped me tweak my system a bit (Toshiba SD5700 DVD Player, Pioneer 509S Receiver, and a Sony KP-41T65 50"" Monitor). ...for me all the tests were very helpful and everything worked like it should. My only wish is that, given how much room for data is available on a DVD, they could have packed it with more demos and/or music. Other than that I've had a blast tweaking my system and showing off to friends and neighbors. ..."
2,"It looked good and I thought it was going to be, BUT IT'S NOT!","I bought this because I needed another calibration DVD to get optimum picture quality out of my TV. I thought this DVD set was going to help, but it didn't. The DVD started out looking good with their company logos looking impressive, then when I went to the video calibration section, it had a lot of tests, but none of them were explained very well compared to ""Video Essentials"". Setting the ""BRIGHTNESS"" function was not helpful AT ALL because they didn't even include the 2 black bars in the test. They show it in the demo but there is only ONE bar in the test pattern. The only redeeming part is its demos. There are a lot of them and most are pretty good, but I didn't buy this DVD for demos, I wanted to make my TV look better. So if you are thinking of buying this, I suggest you rent it, because I was very disappointed. I had high expectations and this disc did not fulfill them."
2,You Might be disappointed,The demo disk is excellent but the setup disk will not play in my Toshiba DVD player. I bought this for for the setup (there are plenty of good movies for demo) so it is pretty worthless. I do not know about other brands of DVD Players but I would not recommend this if you have a Toshiba player.
4,Be realistic,"You guys all know that being a lawyer could be a very hectic and demanding job! This book doesn't deny that cliche-it helps you get the right picture about lawyer's world and for lawyers themselves, the rare chance to refresh their job. I think this book worth reading for whom are interested in legal career or for lawyers, of course!"
3,All good except the brush!,"I received it and it contained all the items.BUT, the brush was much less of the original brush.I kept the original brush. The one they sent had longer bristles but so few!!I am going to try the one they sent over the next few weeks.But I think I will also order the original brush and compare!1Thanks"
2,A one-joke wonder,"This is quite clearly only intended as a parody of Chant. The arrangements are incredibly simplistic (in most cases, one man singing melody, one man singing a third below him, and another a third above), and the songs consist entirely of the melodies of rock songs, sung extremely largo in an echo chamber. This CD was recommended to me by several of my musician friends; I was expecting so much more. It could have been *interesting*, watching standard chant arrangements be adapted to those melodies. Sigh. Well, at least I didn't blow more than $7 on it, though I'm beginning to begrudge at least that. Not worth a re-listen."
1,Worst applicator!!,"OK:) I don't know if Natracare tries their tampons before selling them, but they should, because the applicator DOES NOT WORK!! I bought these tampons after trying Seventh Generation tampons and being totally disappointed. I do like the fact that EVERYTHING is biodegradable but, that is the only good thing about these. First, the applicator being cardboard is NOT painless! However the worst thing is when trying to push the tampon out of the applicator it just wont go, and there is not enough grip on the applicator to be able to get a good hold so it gets very tricky:) I ended up pushing the tampon out of the applicator a little then inserting it. When I did get the tampon in it was never very comfortable and the absorbency was NOT good at all. It leaked fairly quickly and when I removed it there were areas that didn't even absorb. I wanted to like these, but will end up throwing them away:("
5,DISAPPEARING ACT,"To follow up on a sentiment expressed by a previous reviewer, you get less music per dollar now that Sony Classical has bought CBS Records. When these pieces appeared on the CBS label, Bach's French Overture was included with these English Suites; clearly, there was enough space on two CDs to make that work. Nevertheless, Sony excised the French Overture altogether, leaving you with only the English Suites. Moreover, the complete French Suites (also played by Gould) appeared on a single CBS CD but now span two Sony CDs. The filler on the second disc? The same French Overture transplanted from this recording.The bottom line? English Suites + French Suites + French Overture = 3 CDs on CBS, 4 CDs on Sony. You pay more with Sony. Just be aware of that."
5,5 stars is an understatement,"One could describe this music as reaching the pinnacle of musical achievement. It's beautiful, it changes everything around you. My wife brought it into her classroom - all the children worked intently and quietly, all mesmerized by the harmonious counterpoint of Bach by Gould. I can never tire of it."
2,Interested in Camel? Do NOT start here,"I bought this compilation several years ago. I though, oh this is marginally interesting, but rather bland and flat... Turned me off of Camel for many years. But thanks to a good friend who was quite convinced that Camel was awesome, I was introduced to the remastered version of The Snow Goose. Light years different! So much color and depth are LOST on this compilation.So you want to know more about Camel??? Start with a remaster of one of their classics. This compilation is a very POOR introduction."
3,Camel drags a bit in places,"Camel are a British Art Rock/Progressive Rock band who emerged in the early 70's. Music wise they are a mix of Electronica, Funk, Jazz & Rock. This compilation takes bits only from 4 of their 70's albums. In total they put out 7 studio albums between 73-79. The 20 minutes Snow Goose sessions dominate most of this CD between tracks 3 to 8 which can be quite a drag (hence 3 stars) because they are no lyrics, it's all instrumental. Don't get me wrong Camel are great musicians. They are a few lyrics (which are good) on the other selected songs. People here have been moaning about the singing, there is nothing wrong with it, it's typical English, simlair to Pink Floyd's Roger Waters. My overall fave is the Lady Fantasy suite it sweeps you away. If you are not bothered getting an individual album or delve into a 2 CD set maybe this will be a great purchase & for a mid 80's release the sound is great."
2,Very Dated Music,"If you're in to Pink Floyd's instrumentals and Yes's jam sessions then this album is for you and it's probably a three or three and a half star album for you, but most of this is just noodling around and really doesn't get going. ""Lady Fantasy"" is a a powerful epic and is worth owning. The Snow Goose selections are nothing but 20+ minutes of rather dull instrumentals. ""Song Within a Song,"" ""First Light"" and ""Rain Dances"" are all pleasant enough, but you won't be humming any of these songs when it's over. Once every couple years is often enough to hear those four songs. I'd say go out a nd get some Tangerine Dream albums before you plunk down money for this."
3,Public Health,"I had to use this book for my online course. Although the information was helpful, I found the chapters to be lengthy and sometimes difficult to read. If the book is required for your class, then I say buy it. Otherwise you may not look twice at it."
2,A Hamsun gem of a romantic tale in new translation.,"Dreamers is another wonderful non-romantic romance involving ordinary people in a small Norweigen village from the master of the genre, Knut Hamsun. However, this new translation is a great dissapointment to me after reading the 1920's Alfred A Knopf edition. Much of the colour & humor are lost in this edition. I would strongly suggest using Amazon's used book search & auctions to find the out of print Alfred A Knopf version as it is a far superior translation to this edition that will bring many more smiles and laughs to the reader."
1,Avoid General-Books scanned version,"I don't know whether the other reviewers of this Hamsun novel had the same version I purchased from General-Books, but I found it impossible to get beyond the opening sentence, which reads: ""Ihave the htntr to announce that I have teen appointed..."" The publisher warns that this 83-page print on demand paperback was produced from a scanned copy of the original, but this advisory is no excuse for the incredibly sloppy production. Avoid this edition at all costs. New Directions and other publishers offer the same book for a price no much higher than what I paid for this version."
2,Close but no Cigar,"After reading all the rave reviews about this lens, I took the plunge. The first copy I got was so bad I sent it back immediately. In live view with a stable test target (ISO 12233) it couldn't even manually focus it to anything close to sharp. The second one I got was better, but its about 10% less resolution than I'm used to with the Canon 200mm F2.8 and 35mm F1.4 (both amazing lenses). I always enjoy zooming into an image and being surprised by the hidden details I miss viewing ""fit to screen"", but this lens constantly disappoints me. Its never crisp; its always on the soft side. Lots of reviews claim this lens is sharp as a tack but this just isn't my experience with it. I wish it was.Perhaps I'm just expecting too much. The images are extremely sensitive to the slightest movement of the camera, so you must shoot as fast as possible. Stopping it down did not measurably sharpen the images. It might work better with a full frame sensor (I'm using a cropped T1i)."
3,400mm f/5.6 L,"Great lens if you can get it right... I had to send mine back to Canon twice for calibration, second time with the camera.. Fist time lens was found with a broken USM.. Fortunately they replaced it but it came back so so.. Pics were not sharp as this lens is known to be... As of this writing, I haven't received my lens back yet, so will see... I purchased this lens in April of 09...[...]"
5,Canon EF 400 f/5.6 Lens,"Great quality, easy to use. Gives sharp, clear photos! I would recommend this lens to anyone wanting to upgrade their photos to high quality results."
5,Great Lens,I LOVE this Lens. I can take a picture of a Sparrow's eyeball and not even let the little critter know I am looking his / her way.
5,Love it & hate it!,"I love it because it truly does 100 albums. I hate it because it's so damn heavy! My wife is a DJ and she loves it. Holds the vinyl secure, good cushions and straps, it's a quality product. We mainly put it on a cart, when she dj's. I would recommend something like this, but with wheels if you're very mobile. If it will just stay at home to house your vinyl, then it's also ideal. 100 albums fully loaded is about 55-60lb.s"
2,Bad quality,"The size of the toy was alot smaller than I thought. So, if you're buying this to cuddle, DON'T. The details were pretty good but the quality wasn't. It was delivered squished in a paper bag and his hat was deformed. After about a week, the soles of his shoes fell off! I give it 2/5."
1,Nothing more than common sense,We have to use this book for a technical writing class in school. Don't even bother reading the text--the headings will suffice. There's nothing in here that you don't already know.
1,Rip Off,"I ordered this product and needless to say, I do kind of like the exercise bar. Other than that, I do not like the supplements yet they have now automatically charged my credit card and sent me another bottle of them. I emailed to let them know that I did not want them and that I will send them back for a refund. They wrote back and told me that was part of the package. Ummm... I don't think so! I know I didn't agree to anything like that. Buyers Beware!!!"
5,The secondmost read book in Christendom,"The Blessed Jacobus's compilation of the miraculous, ""Golden Legend"" carries you along as it brings you through the image-filled lives of the saints. Crowded, in a most woundrous fashion, with miracles, long martyrdoms, impossible but believable feats, quotable lines, long explanations of extreme intricacy, intriguing dialogue and a most enjoyable theme, it is enjoyable for those who read page after page and enjoy the long story, ending in triumph. It can also be accessible to those who enjoy anecdotes, except here they are pious. They begin the same way, usually--""A friar minor..."" or such. It's hard to stop paging through it"
5,The Golden Legend,An invaluable work of reference for those needing to understand the purposes and and implications of the images contained in renaissance art.
3,1/2 of a two volume set,"This book is 1/2 of a two volume set, which contains pious but not allways accurate lives of Saints. This is more a guide to what people believed then to what the saints actually did."
4,A Life Saver,"Love this stuff--have been using it since I was a kid.This product it great! It helps relieve chafing, makes you feel nice and smooth, and is in convenient tubes you can carry in a purse or bag.The downside is that it does sweat off fairly easy, so reapplication is a must."
4,Monisat Chafing Gel,"This is a fabulous product for both women and men. Ive been using it on a daily basis for a year and am surprised more people don't know about it. I use it on the areas of my body that have a tendency to trap moisture. It goes on as a gel but dries to a silky protective barrier preventing moisture, odor, chafing. Keeps you fresh all day. And none of the residue and dust that powder can leave on your hands, clothes or house!I wish they sold it a more economical size -it is a little expensive when you use it daily. And now I am having a hard time finding it in my local drugstore. The monistat powder is great too."
5,best stuff I've found,"This stuff is great at preventing chafing. I used to get very uncomfortable chafing under the band of my bra, particularly on hot days. Using the powder-gel has pretty much gotten rid of this problem. And I like the way it feels on my skin - not sticky like gel, and somehow not like powder either. It's hard to describe: it's like a breathable invisible layer of smoothness over my skin.The stuff is expensive, but it's better than anything else I've used, and I'm willing to spend the money on it."
2,Generic brand not worth the long haul,"I bought this drive about a year ago and I don't burn dvds very often, still it worked well for about only 6 months. The drive also has a loud train like sound. Not good if you're into audio recording. After 6 months, every dvd AND cd burn gave buffer underrun errors. Now the drive acts as a DVD-ROM as the burning capabilites are depleted.I can see my review is consistent with the others, as you get what you pay for.I learned my lesson to not buy from generic dvd writers, as paying 30 dollars more would have saved me the hassle from buying a new one."

3,Good for specs,"covers all years form 1943 to 2004. Average of 20 pictures for each year. Not really sure what was added to the 2004 version of this book. It has pictures of the 2004 along with the specs and options available. Wondering why no production numbers are shown for 2003 year. There are small write-ups for each year, not enough in my opinion. The brochure section is garbage. All you get is the front cover"
2,Unreliable pens - they dry out quickly,Do not buy these if you plan on storing them for any length of time. The ink dries up very quickly and you are left with a bunch of pens that work intermittently if at all.Save your money and buy some pens that don't dry out so quickly.
4,good enough,"They looked very much like the pens we used years ago, when we worked. Those had ridges along the outer barrel. These do not. These also are comfortable to hold, but we liked the other version better. We haven't had any issues with the ink drying out quickly. They're fine for an every-day pen."
4,Still in box review,I have not started building this model yet. I have examined the parts and so far it looks very good. It could make a great addition to anyone with a 1/144 sub model collection.The instructions seem good.
3,Best of the How to Guide,"This book was a worthwhile purchase. It is very different from many books that just present the strategy or concept with very little or no applicability. The book actually provides one with a ""how to"" guide in addressing the many development, performance and other issues we grapple with in our organisations today."
3,Good But Frustrating at Times,"I would recommend this book to die-hard BOC fans, but think it is the least effective of Popoff's books. It is not as easy or enjoyable a read as his books on Rush or UFO. He frequently bounces back and forth chronologically when describing the band's history, making the narration distracting. In addition, the book is full of distracting clarifications from the editor and rife with misspellings and grammatical issues. Also I thought he glossed over the band's mid-late 80s work and personnel. Additionally, I am not sure if his explanation of the Imaginos concept clarifies or muddies the waters on this work.On the plus side, he does manage to get exclusive interviews with members of the band's inner circle and some great insight on the personalities that made the classic BOC lineup musically formidable. Plus, his love for the band comes through pretty clearly in the writing. Likeminded readers will enjoy it."
4,Underrated,"Don't write this album off just because it's Warrant. When I first heard this I thought ""Warrant has went heavy"". This disc is peppered with great tracks like ""The Hole in My Wall"", ""April 2031"" (disturbing track), ""Andy Worhol"", ""Bitter Pill"" & ""Let it Rain"". Even the aggressive album cover and title shows that Warrant was experimenting and came out with some interesting & tasty results. Worth a listen!"
4,NOT THE WARRANT MOST KNOW OF,"This album is underated and I think judged as just another glam album from Warrant. That said, I think this album is one of the best if not the best they ever have done. Funny thing is I think some songs off of cherry pie would fit in fine with this one. Songs from Cherry Pie like ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" and ""I Saw Red"" would go great with this one. On the other hand the song ""Bonfire"" from Dog Eat Dog would fit on Cherry Pie. Anyway, this is a good album even for music lovers who do not like the first two albums. Worth checking out!"
2,Different Warrant,"I had to check the credits on this album to make sure it was the same group of people doing the songs as Cherry Pie. Sure enough it was the same band members.What happened? Cherry Pie / DRSFR had party songs, even a little top 40 metal. Dog Eat Dog comes off fairly flat and uninspired. I'd even have to say it sounds ""dark."" Around this time the Seattle sound starting making its presence and I think Warrant felt they had to go in this direction to remain competitive.Why? Cherry Pie is such a great album. I had a hard time finding a likeable song on this one and usually turn it off after a few songs. Machine Gun wasn't too bad, but there really wasn't anything that showcased this otherwise very talented band."
2,YOU CAN'T BLAME PEARL JAM,"The guys of warrant always said that the lost of their succes was because of the grunge bands (I ALSO HATE PEARL JAM), but this lp is not like ""DRSFR"" and ""Cherrie pie"". This lp has some good songs,like ""machine gun"",""the hole in my wall"" and ""sad teresa"", but also has horrible songs,such as tracks 3,4 and 7. SO, LOOK AT YOUR BAND,MAN!"
2,"No ""Uncle Tom's cabin"" here...","Warrant's ""Dog eat dog"" was released in 1992 and even `tho the guys can play and Jani Lane is a singer above average, the album is far from being a masterpiece. ""Machine gun"" sounds a bit like ""Cherry pie"" but there's certainly no ""Uncle Tom's cabin"" on this one. Warrant keep on delivering their ""cheerleader rock"" suitable for ice hockey games, but the only time it works is in ""Bonfire"".This release is a rather mediocre effort, in a genre that sure has played out its roll. The only memorable songs are ""Machine gun"", ""Bonfire"" and ""All my bridges are burning"". I think you can live on without this one unless you're a dedicated Hair Metal fan!"
1,"Awful, pitifully awful","I have no idea what Warrant was thinking when they went into the studio and cut these tracks. They are B-Sides at best, with ""The Bitter Pill"" as the only exception. Out of all of their albums, this is the only one I can't tolerate. It's just a truly terrible album, and it's no wonder why it was this album that forced them off the charts and out of the spotlight."
4,"Author interview on Diane Rehm show, 2/2/2005","The Author was interviewed on the Diane Rehm show, 2/2/2005.Sounds very practical and with good ideas.http://www.wamu.org/programs/dr/05/02/02.php"
4,Informative,"I bought this for my mother and she loves it, says it is very informative. It just goes to show also how times have changed and how much brides do on their own as well!"
4,Realistic 60's Rock,"For us dinosaurs old enough to remember the period this is for the most part a realistic look at some of the ""minor"" bands of the mid to late 60's who were largely ""one hit wonders"" but put out some damn good rock. There are in fact some real nuggets here - the Australian band The Easybeats ""Friday On My Mind"" alone is worth acquiring this compilation - and the only thing that keeps this from 5 stars is the somewhat out of place appearance of the Monkees - who really don't belong here - but at least it is two of their most artistic cuts. I find myself listening to this one quite often."
1,1st disc does not play at all,Repeat the 1st disc of les 100 plus belles Chansons d'Amour does not play at all. Now what to do?
3,Not as impressed as others,"I was excited about the book through the first hundred pages or so, then it quickly dissipated. There are some great nuggets of wisdom and great insight strewn throughout the book, but they could have been conveyed much more succinctly. The authors overdid the whole storytelling bit."
2,The Spirituality of Imperfection,"I found this book very difficult to get into. To my mind, it kept going around in circles. I couldn't finish it, but I will try again, for the book came highly recommended."
5,From AA to Zeitgeist,"This is a remarkably wise book, whatever your spiritual history. From Desert Fathers and Thomas Merton to the Tao Te Ching, its scope is broad and charged with a vision of understanding that stands at the base of any effort to the growth of the soul through the five indices: prayer, observance, disciline, thought and action."
4,A Journey For Additive People,"Sometimes very deep insights, but quoting AA""s founder Bill Wilson, gives a very positive way of life for those additicted to alcohol or other substances....................the authors did their homework and it shows.I liked the way they blend in parables to get their point across......................an excellent book for those with long term sobriety or newcomers.......can get a little too deep sometimes, but so can the minds of alcoholics................being sober 31 years I still got a lot out of the book...............and recommended it to many of my AA friends newly sober or long term."
5,best and most comprehensive look at spirituality I have read,"Both Kurtz and Ketcham understanding and writing abilities around such a difficult subject is simply amazing. The amount and depth, of stories told within the context of each area they discuss was excellent. A amazing and wonderful piece of work,one that is best read in measure, and over time."
2,Confusing to this Christian.,"The book was confusing to me, a Christian Man. I am one to follow the Bible and found all the other religoius references distracting. Some will see that as narrow minded. Perhaps. If you are a Christian, there are many better books that will not dilute your faith."
2,not what I expected,I expected more and was disappointed. I'd hope to be able to learn a skill to utilize during counseling sessions. not that helpful . . . .
5,The Sprituality of Imperfction,"This is the most powerful and comforting book I have I have read in years.Working on 9 years in recovery I guess it perfect timing for my work on my Perfectionism which seems to be the basis for all my other ISM""S."
3,The Spirituality of Imperfection: Storytelling and the Search for Meaning,"I thought the reading was somewhat dry and long. It seemed some of the points could have been summed up in a paragraph rather than the better portion of a chapter. I did, however, find the information in the book to be useful."
5,Must read on your list,"""Spirituality of Imperfection."" is a bookthat 8-10 of us are using on Sunday eveningfor our current ""read."" Once you get a feelfor the writing style it becomes easier toread. We have lots of. stop, lets discusswhat we just read. I would recommend it tothose that are on the spiritual journey."
5,This book changed my life,"from the author of DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF: A PERSONAL APPROACH TO DREAM INTERPRETATION; and DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE: A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO DREAMS, DAYDREAMS, AND FANTASIES.I read THE SPIRITUALITY OF IMPERFECTION at the end of 1993, at the suggestion of a friend. I had hesitated to read it because it was ""a recovery book"" and I expected that designation to limit its benefits. What I found, however, were stories that confirmed that to grow we must be willing to fail and make mistakes. This is what it means to be human. With this book's encouragement, hope, and humor, I embarked on my speaking and writing career, willing to blunder and to learn from others. Since then, I have recommended and bought this book as a gift many times. I list this title in my handouts for nearly all of my self-help classes and in the bibliographies of the books I write."

5,The genius of Glenn Gould,"Beethoven may not have approved of these interpretations, but can only admire the technical facility and perfection that Glenn Gould offers. Unconventional in his life and his musicianship, Glenn Gould plays these sonatas with stunning clarity and accuracy that can only be defined as pure genius!"
1,"Great pianist, weird interpretations","Beethoven's piano sonats are among my favorite pieces in the repertoire. I find Gould's way of playing them insulting. I am very fond of Gould's interpretations of Bach, but here, his odd style seems completely inappropriate. He takes ridiculous tempos and his dynamics are strange as well. Perhaps Gould fans may enjoy this, but I wouldn't wish this performance on any lover of Beethoven."
2,May be the Genius of Gould NOT Beethoven for sure!!!,"The two sides of the coin: As a musician, I've learnt that music is a thing such pressured water, it tends to say to our heart how should it sound, even if the interpreter does not deliver the right way, so, we can grasp the original music as it should be played. Beethoven's music is not the superficial music played here, without ANY heart. Where's the deepness of Beethoven ? Gould could reduced Beethoven's music to a mount of fast, precise cascades of notes, that's Glenn Gould's way, not as the music should sound, so, my advice, get this recording as a reference, if you already know the Sonatas played by other pianists, such as Alfred Brendel (he's a true Beethoven interpreter). This Gould here sound mechanic like a Standard Midi file made on computer. Does this man has heart at all ?"
2,No. 12...He's humming in the backgroud,"I have owned many of Gould's recordings but this is awful. He can be heard HUMMING in the background! He chooses to play ""as written"" arbitrarily. He seems to be stoned or drunk as to the meter. This is the worst Gould recording I have ever heard. I feel that I wasted my money on this one."
2,Comedy movie,"Comedies are the flavor of the season and more and more film-makers are following the formula re-invented by David Dhawan and Priyadarshan. Entertainment is the key word, while a logical story goes out of the window. Shashi Ranjan's new outing DHOOM DADAKKA tries to recreate the hungama and gets it quite right in the first hour as well, but it's on a slippery wicket thereafter."
1,Does NOT Work with XP,"This camera absolutely does NOT work with XP.I downloaded the driver, extracted to C:\DVC325, ran setup.Plugged in camera, hit continue on the xp driver-not-digitially-signed dialog, and when it got 99% through the progress bar of copying drivers, hard froze my computer. I tried this on all usb ports, multiple times, all resulting in having to hold the power button to recycle the computer.On one instance, it even locked it such that I had to physically remove the power (I am not sure how they froze the bios routine that polls the power switch, but they did)"
3,Not XP compatible,"This camera worked very nicely for me for 3 years using Windows 98, but it seems to be completly incompatible with windows XP. Consider yourself warned."
3,Quite good but it has reached its EOL,This little warrior worked OK for several years. I've owned for near a decade and it worked OK. It has more resolution that some current cameras but it has reached its End of Life and now Kodak doesn't support it anymore. What does it mean? No more drivers for Vista. It didn't work very well on XP though.
4,good for price,"good, hard to see into the small hole with no eye relief, but it is good for the price and gets the job done."
3,"Nostalgia Purchase, But Not Bad","I remember this book from my middle-school library, and decided to purchase it to see if it really was as good a story as I had remembered.It's not.But it's not bad, either. And at least it tries to bring something unique to the story."
1,Starluck is trash!,"Ugh. If you want real SF you gotta get Spacechance by Jack Klipper, p. hard to find a copy though."
2,Turned into a gloppy mess,I thought this product would be the answer to my son overflowing his diaper - did not see a significant (even slight) improvement in capacity of his diaper over night. I would invest in a better diaper instead - like Euro Briefs
5,The Solution to Leaky Diapers,"My 18-month old son was waking up with leaky diapers about half of the time or more. Since using these, not one leaky diaper. I am thrilled. I'll be ordering more."
1,Didn't work,We used this for my 9 month son. He was waking up wet a lot. When we tried this product he always woke up wet. We were better off not using it. At least there was a chance for him to be dry.
5,No more leaks!!,"My 12 month old son was leaking through his diaper EVERY night without waking. Soaked jammies, blanket, sheets, all the way through the mattress pad. We tried to limit fluids close to bedtime, no luck. I had tried buying up a size, he's already in a four, so I bought up to fives. No help. I tried other brands, we use Pampers Baby Dry, Huggies, Luvs.....nothing worked. So I ordered these diaper pads and wow!! He has been dry every morning for the last week. His diapers are enormous in the morning, but he is dry! I read all the reviews good and bad, and decided to try them with some sceptisim. I am now here to order more. They are plenty big for his size four diapers. I usually put the pad more in the front of the diaper, he's a boy, but it could easily put more central for the baby girls too. If you have leaky diaper issues try these!! My washing machine has already thanked me :0)"
1,Did not work,"This did not work for my baby, they were expensive. I tried Poise Pads from the store and they worked perfect!"
2,Works well when both monitors are on,"Pros: The switch works fine, and I like the attached USB hub switch and audio switch, which can either be linked with the computer switching, or unlinked and ""left behind"" with one computer while switching to the other. Video and audio quality are fine. Works at 1920x1280.Con: If both computers are on with live displays, it works fine. If one or other computers is completely off, or is disconnected, it works fine with the other computer. But if you are working on computer-A for 15 minutes, and computer-B decides to put its display in power-save mode, the switch erroneously routes the power-save to the monitor, blanking it out. Naturally, it requires switching the KVM to computer-B, jiggling the mouse to awaken the screen, and then switching back to computer-A to resume work. It's symmetrical - working on computer-B is equally troubled when computer-A decides to power-save."
5,KVM Switch Review,Product works as expected. Very fast shipping. Good response and updates from seller.
1,Piece of Garbage,"Please save your money!!!!This switch is GARBAGE. It does not handle a long list of mice and keyboards -- any extra functionality on an extended keyboard or a mouse is lost or renders the device useless. The customer service is insultingly bad. Avocent is all about making large switches for large data centers -- a 2 port KVM is not what they do. The fact that this product has ever worked for any user is shocking to me. Also, the unit is overpriced.Save yourself money, get something from IOGear or Belkin or some company that makes peripherals for home computing -- NOT this junk!"
3,Use carefully,"If used carefully, this works correctly most of the time.I have two monitors, a nice 19inch Samsung and a cheap 22inch Acer widescreen. When the samsung is used in this switch, all systems are go. It flawlessly negotiates between systems. However, when the Acer is plugged in, the monitor often refuses to return from it's sleeping state, and when it does, it often comes up with an incorrect resolution. (This monitor has no issues when connected directly to the PC.) I've had to settle with using the smaller of my monitors through the KVM.Another bug shows itself when playing videogames. Sometimes the USB keyboard loses all signal and must be unplugged and replugged into the back of the KVM. This issue never arises when the keyboard is directly connected to the PC.On the other hand, I've never seen a KVM that works flawlessly. It's a complicated problem with no perfect solution."
2,"works so so, kinda wonky","I have an unusual setup:I have a g4 laptop and a dell tower, both hooked up to 2 evoluent vertical mice (one left handed, one right handed), a microsoft ergo keyboard 4000, and a wacom intuous 3.The tablet simply does not work when connected through the kvm. One of the mice consistently dies when connected through input 1. Periodically, the other mouse will die and the dead one will revive when switching. un plugging and re plugging brings them back.My mac can't recognise the microsoft keyboard through input 1, even though there is a driver installed for it, and it recognizes it when it is directly connected.Ocaisionally, the screen corrupts, switching back and forth fixes it...If you have a fancy setup like mine with lots of sensitive input devices, splurge for something a little nicer."
2,"The switch is ok, but the customer service is not","If you happen to buy a non-defective switch, it will last forever. But my first delivered switch didn't handle video. Now, considering that is was a clear case of defective equipment, Avocent actually made me pay for return shipping and for the delivery of a replacement box.I'm never buying anything from Avocent again. It's a matter of principle - if a company makes me pay for THEIR mistakes, it's not worth dealing with."
1,Less than reliable.,Had the USB ports fry on me - their customer service wasn't helpful as it was out of warranty. There's no way I'd buy a Avocent product again. See the reviews on the 4 port version for more tales of ports going belly up.
2,No Mac or BlueRay Support,I have a MAC G5 and DELL Inspiron w/Bueray drive. First switch was defective but they sent replacement by 2nd day. Switch does not support blueray. My DVI cables all work directly from monitor to computer but not thru box. Avocent says blueray is not supported. The Mac mouse has a 2-axis scroll 'wheel' but the switch reverses the horizontal and vertical axis. Avocent says the Mac mouse is not supported. Good luck:-(.
2,bimodal distributions are a bad sign,"In this case, the Kindle itself seems to be the culprit. Word on the street is that the Kindle cannot, er, 'handle' the full content here.Now go buy an iPad like a real man."
1,So Bad I Can Taste It,"And it tastes like llama droppings.I would only read McCovey Chronicles if I hated the San Francisco Giants, America, music, Buster Posey, Tims, Gordon Beckham's hair, MS Paint, God, cod, myself, stats, splits, Jorge Cantu, trading a B-ish prospect for the left-hand side of a 1B platoon, rosterbation, pie, and oxford commas.I guess $0.99 is a pretty good deal though."
2,Mozart For Masochists,"I love Glenn Gould -- when he's playing Bach, that is. But Gould hated Mozart, and while some of his early Mozart recordings are quite nice, the Mozart recordings he did in the 60's and 70's (i.e., on these discs) were simply bizarre. And not in a good way. They are exhibitions in spite, and spite is not fun to listen to. Granted, some of the slow movements are played beautifully -- but there's more to Mozart than slow movements. The fast movements (i.e., two thirds of the music in the average sonata) are a horror.If you want to hear Gould at his eccentric best, buy anything he did with Bach -- or his Haydn albums, his early Beethoven sonatas (avoid Sonata No. 23, though), his Sibelius, Scriabin, Schoenberg or his Byrd & Gibbons albums. But stay clear of Mozart."
1,glad to disagree,"I love Gould's Bach recordings, but I HATE his attacks on Mozart's sonatas! He said that he didn't like Mozart much, and it really shows in these desecrations. I don't even find them interesting as oddities or as alternate interpretations. Why didn't he leave these works alone?"
1,this is not mozart,"By his own admission, Glenn Gould didn't like Mozart's music and he especially didn't like his piano sonatas. OK, fair enough. But then why record them and later write an essay explaining why he doesn't like them? Actually, who (except Gould himself) really cares whether he liked Mozart? What we have here is a supremely talented but off-puttingly arrogant show-off making fun of a revered composer and admiring himself for doing so. Yes, Gould can play the piano. His digital dexterity is nothing short of amazing. But it's not Mozart. It's not even seriousness musicianship. There is no single correct way to play Mozart. All sorts of interpretive possibilites are open to a pianist. (Witness Casadesus, Klien, Brendel, Barenboim, Schnabel, Uchida, Schiff, Richter, Kraus, Perlemuter, and others.) But Gould's travesty is not one of them. His is without a doubt the worst recording of Mozart's piano sonatas that I ever heard. If anyone disagrees, I would welcome a reply."
3,Bachian Mozart - For Gould Fans Only.,"The problem with Gould is that he wants to treat everything like Bach. A friend of mine who listened to the D major sonata without knowning Gould's at the piano, and he thought the CD player was broken. Gould once said that Mozart died too late rather than too soon, and you could clearly sense his viciousness in this complete cycle. Unfortunately what he said of Mozart applies to him also. This suite is nothing traditional. So if you are an adventure kind, try this suite, otherwise there are other better options."
1,Painful to listen to,"If Gould looks at classical composers such as Mozart and Beethoven with such disdain, why then, does he play their complete works, making a mockery of them in the process? I love Mozart's sonatas, but Gould's performance somehow manages to fill me with disgust (I do love his Bach performances), something I thought impossible when listening to these wonderful pieces. In my opinion, this CD should not be bought or listened to."
1,Humming is Horrible!!,"Seriously, I don't mind his unique interpretation, BUT, the humming is truly disturbing and creepy. I listen to Mozart to relax and his humming is so noticeable and strange that I feel as if someone has sneaked into my house and is creeping up behind me! HORRIBLE! He should obviously be putting that emotion into his playing and not wasting it on humming and singing while playing. I hesitate to call someone a master who cannot control themselves while playing. I will never buy any recordings from him again. Truly Horrifying!"
2,Gould and Mozart...,"Anyone who is a fan of Gould knows his personal opinion of the Mozart sonatas. Listening to this interpretation of Mozart is about as entertaining as being in a room full of typewriters and screaming infants--both monotonous and completely irritating at the same time. If you're new to Gould go to his interpretation of Bach's Well Tempered Clavier or the English suites...if you want definitive recordings of the Mozart sonatas try Brendel, Eschenbach or Uchida. There is no denying Gould's genius...it just not found in this recording."
5,Beautiful music for young and old alike!,This whole album is a wonderful mix of instrumentals and vocals. I actually use this album for myself to go to sleep at night. It's just absolutely beautiful. Classics with soothing lyrics....
3,"Stoopid & Offensive, But Sometimes Very Funny","Poolboy: Drowning Out The Fury is a spoof of action movies starring Kevin Sorbo and Danny Trejo. I didn't love the movie, as it is very uneven. It's also stupid and offensive, but it is sometimes pretty funny."
3,"Finally, a spoof worth laughing at!","""Poolboy: Drowning Out the Fury"" is not a serious action film. Clearly, the title explains it's genre. 'Drowning Out the Fury' is a sequel to ""Poolboy"" - a film moviegoers never heard of because the studio banned it from being released, or so claims fictioness filmmaker Saint James St. James. It was shot in 1990 by Saint James St. James who at the time was 10 years old. The film stars Kevin Sorbo (hey, wasn't he Hercules?!) as the film's hero who returns to America after serving in Nam. When he returns, he discovers his nation (and the pool cleaning business) has been hijacked by Mexicans. He then proceeds to clean up the nation and re-claim the pool cleaning business once and for all. The script is more racist than ""Blazing Saddles"". It's all in good fun if you don't take the jokes seriously. Danny Trejo co-stars along with other notable appearances by Jason Mewes and Richard Karn."
5,Greatest. Movie. Ever. Made.,"Once in awhile, there comes a movie so powerful, so thought provoking, and so prophetic that you just want to stop everything you're doing, stand up, and slow clap. This is that movie. St. James St. James continues to defy critics and any sexual orientation thrown at him. He is a visionary, even though he can only see out of one eye. God bless this film. Buy it and let it live inside of you."
4,Absolutely Hilarious!!!,"I watched this movie with my friend a few hours ago, and it was awesome. It was very dirty, racist, sexy, and my style of comedy. This is a movie within a movie where director Saint James St. James tells how 'Poolboy II' was deemed too terrible to release. Kevin Sorbo stars as a Vietnam Veteran named Sal Bando. After the war, Sal comes home to start his own pool-cleaning business. When his wife and son are killed, he goes on a one-man war against the Mexicans. I highly recommend POOLBOY: DROWNING OUT THE FURY!!!"
4,Good for some laughs!,"For a spoof movie,Poolboy is good for some laughs! Kevin Sorbo is pretty hot looking in the camflouge shorts and tank top,not to mention a couple of scenes in which he is in military uniform. Anyway,if you want to have fun and laugh a lot,then check this movie out!"
4,My Family in the House,Captured the interest of my Grand-daughter. She uses this family in her doll play house; playing many hours on end
2,disappointing,"This I'm afraid is not a very helpful book. By it's title, I assumed it would provide a historical testimony to goings-on at Azusa Street at the beginning of the 20th Century. But in fact it gives little historical insight that is of any real help; instead the author tries to give instructions and encouragements to her readers, much of which I find unhelpful, even patronising. The style of wriiting, too, leaves much to be desired. I do not recommend it."
5,50 Ways to a Healthy Heart by Dr.Barnard MD,"One of the world's most famous heart specialists indicates thatdiet, stress control and nutrition are important conditionsprecedent for a healthy heart. Conquering obesity involves burningfat efficiently and building muscle. Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids areimportant nutritional supplements , in addition to, Mg., K, Ca.,Se, and Zinc. Increased stress levels lead to death and divorce.Music can be a good health tonic to manage stress. Transfats aredangerous to the body. These are found in red meat, frozen foodsand sweets. The greatest danger is that the transfats may becarcinogenic. The author cautions us to eat slowly and chewthe food thoroughly. Red wine is cited as a good health tonicfor the blood and protection against arteriosclerosis. Grapeand elderberry juice can be substitutes for red wine. Overall,this acquisition is worth the price paid for the extraordinarylevel of research scholarship employed in the health and dietarysciences."

3,A nice book for all readers!,"Olympic Dreams is a good book I think,but why do they have it about horses,when there are bearly any in it?I like it,but I think it would be better if Larianne Snelling could put more horses in it!!"
5,:),"Great book! I love the way Lauraine Snelling writes! Sometimes it's a bit too much about God this and God that, but else this is super!"
5,Keeps hardware cool.... striking design,"Not only does this case keep the system running cool, but its design has numerous practical benefits. Screwless card system works great, as does the vibration-free HD cage. I slide my HD cage in through the front and added another 120 mm fan. HDs run at 29, 30C."
4,Enya-Watermark,"I originally bought this piece for ""Miss Claire Remembers"", but ened up enjoying the book as a whole for all of the songs titles."
3,Worth buying... but mixed results...,"As ""A Customer"" mentioned, ""Watermark"" is an easy piece to play. It lends itself to the piano. For this alone, it was worth the price. But other pieces, even if you have the skill to play them, owe their sound to Enya's ethereal style that can only be achieved by artificial sound manipulation."
1,"OK Card, but doesn't work with Flight Simulator","This card has performed OK for me in other areas, but it will NOT work with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 or FSX. It doesn't just not work; it actually causes your computer to spontaneously reboot, so you not only can't play but you lose a lot of time trying to figure out the problem. However, as long as you don't go into Flight Simulator, it seems to work fine. I suspect it is incompatible with the later versions of DirectX."
4,Budget Sound Card thats headache free for older PC's,"I bought this card for a friend whose C Medica AC97 Audio Device stopped working on their HP Pavaillon Desktop. After trouble shooting and wasting time trying to install drivers that didn't work, I finally decided the simplest solution was to find a budget sound card. This was an older computer that just need the sound working again with minimal fuss and money to get the sound back. I found this sound card at office depot for only 19.99. I read some reviews on my iPhone before my purchase to make sure it was a trouble free install, and it only took 5 minutes to get everything working. I would disable/uninstall your integrated sound from your MOBO before you add a new sound card. That being said its a good sound card."
1,Diamond XTREME JUNK!,"I am in full agreement of the first review! No amount of coaxing has worked for installing the 16-bit card, so I bought the 24-bit card, same thing! I emailed and called costumer support, however there is no support. No return emails, nobody is ever available by phone. Stay away, do not buy, be warned! You get what you pay for."
2,Not compatible with Flight Simulator X,The sound card was not compatible with Flight Simulator X and caused it to lock up even without the gameport being used. The game port was not recognized by Win XP and there were no instructions on how to configure the gameport. In fact the product specs didn't even mention that the game port was there. Overall a disappointing product.
3,Disappointing.,"Maybe I was expecting too much. But then I'm not an astronomy buff.Each slide gives the name of the object, but no other information. You need to go to the last chapter for that information. So to me this just seems to be a random selection of images in no particular order.It needs a better menu system. The chapters aren't labeled, there's just a sample picture for each choice. Maybe it would mean something to someone more knowledgeable than me. I don't know if they're grouped by type of object or by source of the image. Also I have no idea how to find what does interest me.I was hoping for the Hubble Deep Space image. Maybe it's on here, but I don't know."
3,It's ok as a demo disk I guess but I probably won't watch it ever again.,"This blu-ray was kinda cool but if you want to look at pictures of stars, just go on the internet and look at hubble pics or somethin. This would be good as a demo disk I guess but I wasn't that impressed with it. I felt like I kinda wasted my money."
1,disappointing,"It is very disappointing that it is just a dvd with photographs.Although the pictures are nice, I can find those in my books. If I would have know I certainly would not have bought this dvd. Waste of money."
1,Horrible product,"Good for small tile repairs.If you attempt to remove grout from anything larger than 2 square feet, you will be very disappointed. This bit wears down ridiculously fast... a huge waste of time and money.Don't take a chance on it.Bosch should be ashamed of themselves."
5,Layman's review on A Guide to Common Freshwater Invertebrates of North America,I'm an avid fly fisherman with a keen interest in benthic macroinvertebrates. I found this book to be an excellent reference for my purposes. The illustrations are especially good as is the text describing the:Different Kinds in North AmericaDistribution in North AmericaHabitatMovementFeedingOther BiologyStress ToleranceI would strongly recommend it to others with a similar interest.
4,Freshwater Invertebrates of North America,"I purchased this title as a fly fisherman wanting to learn more about entomology. This was a very helpful book written at a high school level which is good for someone wanting to tackle the subject for the first time and to get a good grasp of the vocabulary and science before moving on to more detailed college texts on the subject.The plates and drawings are limited (one per insect discussed) but nice. This should be considered an introductory text, and helpful in that manner. Not much for the fly tyer, but good information for the fly fisherman."
2,"Cheap and currently functional, but with some drawbacks.","I received this item just a couple of weeks ago, and yet the edges of the plastic pieces which slide up and down the springs (see them at either side of the strap in the middle) have already broken with only very light, sporadic use. However, it is only the edge of the plastic ""rings,"" so for now it still works fine but it does raise concerns about the quality of the plastic/construction. So, for the money, it is not bad but I wouldn't expect great craftsmanship and I'm not holding my breath for this to last for ever. (kind of contradicts the brand name in that respect...)"
5,"Very effective, light and inexpensive",I've had this for a couple of months now and it has been used quite a bit and has proven its worth. A great product for the price.
4,Impressive performance!,"Though the sound quality especially of the 2nd piano concerto in B-Flat is likely poor, this recording can be highly recommended for the Beethoven and Gould ""fan"": In particular in the 4th concerto Mr Gould strikes the wonderful and ever-changing balance between play and elegance that that makes Beethoven that great.Besides it's a real pleasure to listen to the cadenza of the 1st movement, 1st concerto which is elaborated and (of course) performed by Mr Gould."
5,Reconstruction of Primitive Christian Documents,"From cover: ""In this chronicle, the Christian will find confirmation of his most cherished beliefs, while the claim of psychic science to the possibility of obtaining exact knowledge by supernormal means is vindicated to the full."" An automatic writing work channeled through Cummins not unlike the method used by another author for A Course In Miracles."
5,The Best Intercom Ever !,"I purchase 2 of these intercoms after reading all of the reviews. I have gone through 9 other cheaper intercom units in the last 5 years. The cheaper ones all started to crackel when talking and eventually you could not understand what the other person was saying. Thes unit have so many channels, you can find the one that's right for your location. So far so good, the only minor complait I have is, they make a couple of beeps after you release the PTT button. The PTT button is what you push when you want to talk. Other wise these units work great and are the clearest intercoms, I have ever used. Great Jog Murs.I would stringly recommend spending a little more money and purchase these unit. Vert, Very Happy."
5,I don't have to shout anymore,"I purchased these for our home because I was tired of yelling down the basement stairs. Our house doesn't have intercom, but the basement is quite soundproof and my husband's office is there. Our cell phones don't get very good reception in the basement and we don't have a landline, so calling is out of the question. Instead of having to yell down the step, walk down the steps to ask a yes/no question, or let him know that dinner is ready, all I have to do is press a button. He also occasionally wears headphones, but the unit can flash if a call is coming in so he can see it even if he can't hear it. It was a little tricky to set up (we started off on different frequencies, bu figured it out shortly), but we've both been happy with it. I also like that it's portable, so if he decides to work in the detached garage, one unit can be moved there."
5,Base Unit Serves Purpose Well,"I have two of these Dakota Alert base units at our ranch in rural East Texas, with one at my house and another at our daughter's house about 500 feet away. We also installed one of the Dakota Alert infrared driveway alarm transmitters on the lane leading to her house. The system has good range and provides a dependable intercom system between the two houses."
2,Not a good solution for motion sensing on the driveway.,Bought this thinking the external antennae might give it longer range. Alas this is not so. It worked less consistently than my Dakota Alert 3000.The voice alert is horrible also. At least the 3000 plays a merry tune.
4,Great new song,"I love Colin Raye's music, so perhaps I am biased, but I think that his new song is great. It is his typical country music, with a slight pop twist. I would recommend it to all Colin Raye fans."
5,Works well,"While I haven't anointed this the best body product I've ever owned, I will say that it works nicely to smooth out skin. It might dry you out a bit, especially if you use it every day. It is a good item, though, and does its job well.I would say that if you are thinking about this or the glove, you should go for the glove. This is bigger but less useful--I find it bulky and hard to use due to its size. I would prefer to have the same honeycomb material in a more manageable form."
3,Some recipes lack good flavors,"The recipes that I've tried from this book have disappointed. They lacked flavor, like something was missing. The recipes are indeed quick because of the 6 ingreients but after trying some recipes, I'd never make them again. I think I'll try for recipes that are quick an easy, but not reswtricte by ingredient quantity."
2,Gould plays first fiddle,"...in the sense that he dominates the performance with quirky and mannered pianism that robs these wonderful sonatas of their excitement, vitality and melodic lines. Exaggerated staccatos, bizarre arpeggios, sudden accents, sluggish tempi: musical ""originality"" taken to an irritating extreme. What makes things worse, there is little or no cohesion or musical dialog between the piano and the violin (my CD-set, a recent Sony release, lacks the gamba-keyboard sonatas). Laredo's tasteful playing is not enough to salvage the overall performance. I will not return to this set.I'm only reviewing these CDs in order to recommend the superb rendition of these sonatas by violinist Frank Peter Zimmermann and pianist Enrico Pace (Bach: Violin-Keyboard Sonatas). They make a world of difference with an exciting, perfectly balanced and emotional performance of these six masterpieces. An absolute must-have set!"
4,Does the job,This product does EXACTLY what it's supposed to. It throws beer from a can down the gullet in quick and inebriating order.
1,182 Pages of Index,"Mr. LeoGrande has written a 590 page book with an additional 182 pages of notes and index. Only a university with a great basketball program such as UNC (the publisher) could afford to humor such a person. On the book cover, it states Mr. LeoGrande is an employee of ""American University"" yet doesn't bother to inform me about this school. Is it well-known like Harvard or MIT? At any rate he knows how to go on and on about his chosen subject."
3,A good view for fans of the wild man,"If your idea of rock n roll art includes viewing 3 seconds of video of captain beefheart in his trout mask replica costume, then this documentary is for you.Larry was part of the troupe of independent rock artists that comprised Frank Zappa's independent label Bizarre/Reprise. Thus the documentary gives you some views into the late 1960's Los Angeles scene.Larry's infectious sing-songs about his personal miseries have a childish charm, and you get to see many performances spanning over 3 decades, from street-side to a bit on ""Laugh In"". Larry's mental illness was tragic, and its debilitating effects on him are amply demonstrated in this video.If you have a warm spot in your heart for the wild man, this video is for you."
1,LCD is dark when screen is facing forward.,"The screen started flickering within 4 or 5 months and the only way to correct this was to ""wiggle"" the screen. Ater 6 months, the LCD no longer worked unless the screen was turned to the side."
1,Loud Beeping - Defective,"After installing without testing we soon realized this thing was annoying. It started beeping obnoxiously until we unplugged it. This happend with the unit even in standby mode. TI seemed the kitchen timer that is built into it was stuck on. Manufacturer suggested returning it, so we did and went after a different brand."
3,One for two ain't bad...,"I bought one of these a while back and installed it in the kitchen. It was perfect! Used it with no problems for ~year. When we sold the house, we left the unit behind and I purchased a second for our new house. After installation (oops) I realized that none of the buttons on the unit worked. The remote worked fine so we dealt with it. However, now the whole thing is on the fritz. I just called customer service and am hoping for satisfaction, but although I just installed it, it was purchased 8 months ago, so I'm probably out the $. If you buy this, test it first and test it fast!UPDATE: Phillips sent me a brand new (upgraded) unit which works perfectly."
3,"Find another one if you can or accept what you get, like I did.","Its nont bad other then it takes 8 seconds to start up once you hit the start button, also the speakers sound like its in the box and the clock works to fast. one more thing, the picture shows silver but comes in white."
1,WARNing Look elsewhere for a Better way to spend your money,"Purchased this item 2 months before a new model came out. After 3 months, the screen went, unless you want to wiggle it every so often till you can get it to come back and then your stuck with the direction you stopped at, in my case either towards the kitchen or the dinning room. Couldn't exchange it because the new model was out and it had been over 30 days at the store. By then the warranty was up. If you like listening to music and don't want to watch the TV/DVD, your fine with this, although the sound isn't the greatest, otherwise steer clear of this one."
2,Incessant beeping noise,"We loved this tv/dvd/radio player. It was easy to install, very stylous fitting well in our kitchen. The remote never worked great, but that was okay. Then about 1 year later all of a sudden a loud screeching beeping sound began. It sounded like the alarm clock...the only problem the only way to turn it off was to unplug the unit. After pressing every possible button a thousand times, it miraculously stopped, for a week, and then started again. And this time we could not turn it off. We are sad to say it but have removed this defective device and bought another less attractive system that works. No more Phillips products for us."
2,False advertising,"Picture indicates that you'll get multiple pieces. Read through the product description and never did it say 1 count or 1 piece. Thought the value for several pieces was great, in reality 1 piece for the price was misleading"
5,Wooden Mushroom,You get a single mushroom and it looks exactly like the picture. It is very small so this is not for children who put everything in their mouth. If your child is past this stage these are great. The small size makes them easy to store and add several to a toy pan. Wonderful brand ours get hit on the pan and sliced with toy knives and they still look new. Excellent toy!
4,neglected baroque music,"An excellent recording of some composers we do not hear enough of.Note that on several occasions Gould called Orlando Gibbons, a featured composer on this CD, ``my favourite composer.''"
5,A Seinfeld for the Pop Art World,Matthew Vescovo does for the obvious what Seinfeld did for the mundane--made it clever and hilarious! This is a very enjoyable and smart book. It calls attention to common place things and occurances that we all experience everyday and gives it an irreverent twist. Kudos to Matt Vescovo! I look forward to future lessons!
2,Read it in the store,"I did. It's about three times shorter than it should be, suitable at most for a 15-minute skim while the partner is looking for a real book in some other part of the store. I mean, is this all? By the time the book goes into the self-indulgent 'notes' section, you realize that without this filler the book would be slimmer than a kiddie title.It's a funny little trope; I'll grant that. But apparently either complacency or lack of ideas cut off the faucet before the job was done."
4,For Synergeyes users:,Very effective. Use with clear care 3% hydrogen peroxide solution and keep contacts soaked for at least 12 hours. I am using my contacts for over a year with help of this product.
4,Works very well,I was having trouble with a certain brand of 2 week disposable contact lenses having excess protein buildup. I use this product every week and it has extended the life of the contacts.
5,The Last Hope for Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) Lens Wearers,"This is the most reasonable and high quality tablet enzyme available for contact lens wearers. Most manufacturers have discontinued tablet enzymes. They are pushing the drops. However, I have found that the drops do not work well enough on RGP contact lens. You still need the tablets. If the tablet enzymes disappear then many more eye infections may result. The enzymes keep your lens clear of bacteria that can and do lead to infections. Thank you Amazon for still carrying this product. This is an important product for all lens wearers especially RGP lens wearers."
3,Advertised for use with gas permeable rigid contacts,"I was excited to see this product as it was advertised to be for hard contacts. I used to buy an enzyme tablet that was specifically for rigid gas permeable contact lenses. Those were taken off the market, I imagine because rigid contact wearers are becoming fewer and fewer. When I received this product I was disappointed when I read the insert as there is nothing mentioned at all about use for gas permeable lenses. I'm using them anyway, assuming that if they can't hurt soft and more fragile lenses, they hopefully will be ok to use on my hard ones."
1,Power 2000 battery NOT Sony battery,"This is just terrible. It says Sony battery, but when I get the battery it says ""Power 2000 for Sony"" battery. The battery is not a Sony battery at all. Hi-Tech does not give you the product they say. The picture is not even the same as the actual product."
1,not what i had expected,"These replacement filters were not factory, they are cheap knockoffs that use basic furnace filters instead of the HEPA filters."
3,DeLonghi Air0Purifier Replacement Filter - Need more information,"This was one of a few purchases in a row that just about cured me of buying online. There was not enough information so I did not get what I was wanting. This does fit my purifier, but it is not the part that I needed. I wish Amazon would give more detailed information on their replacement parts so this doesn't happen again."
4,GREAT vocals...much like Evanescence...only better?,"GREAT German band (singing in English). I'm told this newest release is a bit ""toned down"" compared to their previous release...which was more in the Guano Apes style. This girl can SING....and not too hard on the eyes either.The last two songs(There You Are, Worlds Away) on the CD are my favorites....then Slow Day....which is the one I heard first.This was recorded in L.A. so maybe it is(or will be) released to the U.S. ...and their website ( www.diehappy.de ) is in German and English. WELL worth listening to."
3,Macdonald offers solid fare in this Archer mystery.,"Lew Archer works for the sleaziest rich people in California on a consistent basis. Their concealed pasts go back 20 years, sometimes longer, and in the process of the plot's unravelling several dead bodies usually turn up (including fresh ones). In this novel, his first national bestseller in 1969, two broken families have intertwined tragic pasts that Archer ends up disclosing. By the end they're not happier, but have faced the ugly truth about themselves. This book is compact, unified in time and setting, and has nice plot twists. Macdonald has been criticized for rewriting the same book, and there is a consistency of character and milieu in his work. But hey, if it's not broke... The end is a lift from Macdonald's The Galton Case, widely regarded as his best book. When you've read that one--and if there's a better PI novel written since WWII I don't know of it--try this one. It's a good read by a good writer."
1,Good idea - Poor quality control,"I purchased this as a gift. The first time it was used, the CD drive worked once for a few minutes and never worked again. It would just keep searching for a CD and never find it. We tried new music CDs right out of the package, MP3 CDs, older music CDs and nothing worked. It wouldn't recognize that we had a CD.I returned the first one thinking that any product has a few defects in it. Got the replacement and it was worse, if possible. It never worked at all.To be fair, the tape and the radio parts of the unit worked fine, but the CD part (which is what we really wanted) never worked at all. I have purchased many CD players before and never had one that didn't work. It's not that difficult a product to produce. This product is obviously not manufactured with any kind of quality control.I would NOT recommend this item to anyone. Perhaps we may have gotten a good unit if we had tried again, but for me, two defective units in a row is too much."
2,"Going back - poor AM reception, poor remote",I am returning this unit because of poor AM reception (I listen to talk radio) and because you can't turn the unit on or off via the remote control.
2,Looks can be deceiving,"Overall this product seems to be a good value. There are very few ""boomboxes"" that offer the functionality of this unit with digital AM/FM, Cassette, CD and MP3. Even with super saver shipping it arrived very quickly. However, the picture shown of this item is misleading....the unit I received looks very different from the picture on this page. Mine is silver (not black) and the design is much less sleak. Additionally, I paid for gift wrapping and I suppose due to the size they put it in a cloth gift sack rather than using paper. The problem is that with the boombox inside the sack which is inside the shipping box the sack got all dirty, it has a hole in it and is horribly wrinked....not at all worth the price of gift wrapping."
4,shedding new light,"This recording of the Hammerklavier is not a studio recording. It's a CBC radio broadcast hence the quality of the recording is one of the worst in the Glenn Gould collection. Asides from the quality, he does bring new light to this sonata, especially in the Fugue. The Allegro also has a certain light-heartedness to it that is a complete breath of fresh air.Now with the sonata in Fsharp major, Beethoven must be rolling in his grave when this sonata was first performed by Mr. Gould. It is one of the most strange playing that I've ever heard. Its not a bad recording by any means, in fact I find it superb.Basically the only thing I can say is that this recording is probably completely wrong from the composer's intentions, but somehow shines under the improvisatory nature of the pianist.And Glenn Gould is no ordinary pianist.Its a very strange sonata. Hear it, be baffled, then fall in love with it."
1,not what i ordered,"i bought this guitar a little after christmas because my old one was warping. my sister had just gotten a new guitar and i thought it was really cool so i found one that was similar.It was supposed to come within 5-7 days, i waited eleven. according to the picture it had blue around the edge and was a cutaway guitar. There was no blue, there was no cutaway. It was the exact same guitar as my sister's!needless to say i am very dissapointed and am returning this guitar."
3,Two-piano version play along. wfz,"The Liszt transcriptions produce almot as much music as my two piano versions. It's fun to play along. Glenn does his usual impossible performance. Pure genius. wfz Bill Zahn, Long Beach CA"
3,MUSTANGERS WAS A LITTLE SLOW!!!!,"I have read several books by Gary McCarthy. I don't think this was one of his best. It is the story of Pete Sills, a young man who is learing the business of being a mustanger. He has bcome one of the best. It is about his love for Candy, the owners daughter and also Maria, a girl who really loves him. All he wants to do is catch wild horses. Candy finally leaves with a Dr. and he and Maria get married. He has made a foe in Lester Barron, who wants to kill all the wild horses to make room for cattle to feed. Lester and his men try to kill Pete and Maria, but in the end right wins out. As Pete quotes his friend Jack Kendall, "" If a man died having had one good woman, one good friend and one good horse, he should feel privileged to have lived so well."" A short easy to read book but not the greatest by far."
3,Enjoyed the book,I enjoyed the book. It is a basic retelling of the Dolittle raid. I would have liked a little more indepth information on the raid. This is a book for the first time reader of the raid
2,Disappointingly Superficial,"As an amateur naval historian, I've always been fascinated by the bravery of that first takeoff of a fully loaded B-25 at a time when the US was at such a low point in its 20th century history. Despite the advice of my Navy colleagues (especially one who journeyed to China in an attempt to recreate Doolittle's travels in China) I bought this product thinking that the reviews justified the purchase. Anyone who would seek an in-depth history of that mission and the courageous men who made that extraordinary mission, and who is accustomed to the depth and detail of professional military historians will be disappointed at the number of questions unanswered. Otherwise, it's a nice 3-hour read."
2,Weak and Confused Effort by our Heroes,"These musical geniuses really got turned around at the end of the decade. From flying high with the Byrds to gigging with a weak late 70's bar band, these guys sound like Gerry Rafferty reborn on this Spinal Tapish collection of forgotten late 70s-early 80s pop. Where's Dennis DeYoung's over-the-top vocals to complete the debacle?"
1,Frustrated in Farlington,"When the package arrived at my house I felt like a little kid on Christmas morning. In all the years of my adult life I had never felt anticipation like I did that day. I whooped and hollered for the kids to come in from the yard. Much to my unexpected disappointment, both me and my kids alike went to bed crying that night. We could not connect the ball with the paddle but my son ended up in the emergency room with a black eye. He was not alone though. His younger sister was in the bed next to him with a dislocated shoulder. Needs a more descriptive warning label."
2,Disappointed,The substance and content of the story was real but the acting boring. The plot at times was hard to follow. I was disappointed
5,Loved This Movie,"I was very impressed with this movie. The story line was believable, the characters were genuine, and the acting was actually very good. The connection between the two characters was wonderful to watch. What a wonder story."
3,"Good story, but too low-budget.",I liked the movie's story line. The editing should have been better. Live footage was intertwined with the movie that should not have been there.
1,Rag Tag Trash,"Don't waste your money on this low-budget movie. If you like movies with no believable characters, plot or point - this is the film for you. It is great to have gay people of color making films but does it have to be crap? This movie is one step away from being bad porn. SAVE YOUR MONEY. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE?"
2,"Worse version of ""Beautiful thing""","The title of my review is expressing my feeling I had after I had finished watching ""Rag Tag"".Rag and Tag are two friends, best school mates (same thing in ""Beautiful thing"").At some point they are being seperated. Then we meet them 10 years later. And then we watch another part of the movie, and another one and then we can see them making love and...back again to another part and the end.The plot itself wouldn't be so dull, if the director took care of some important details. Which? Actors. Pictures. Sets.Acting in some parts is soooo wooden that a spark would set the whole thing on the greatest fire of all.O.K. it is a low cost film, but it cannot justify such simple things like changing the skin color of one of main characters - first both boys are black, then one of them (in the 10 year gap) changes his eyes color to blue and bleach his skin...wth???Set. No difference between now and then. 10 years is not 10 months.Bottom line? I was expecting much more."
5,ragTag review,"This was indeed a very beautiful love story. It drives home the fact that love is just love,whether it be gay or stright, heterasexual or same-gender loving, interracial or ethnic, love is just what is -love. I enjoyed very much. It is another movie that I will watch over an over."
5,Romeo and.... Romeo,"A really good story. Yes, it is predictable but it is still done well. The boys are beautiful and the scenery is great too."
3,Kind of cheap looking,"In bedroom of child who likes dance, but it is kind of a cheap poster/frame. But it is cheap, so you get what you pay for"
3,small,"I thought this was going to be a full-sized Garfield toy, but it is very small. I was disappointed as this was a very expensive toy purchased as a birthday gift for my daughter. It's cute and there is nothing wrong with it, it just was big enough"
4,Goodnight Garfield Ty Toy,"This present was great. Real cute and one of a kind. Was a little smaller than I thought, but still a great gift. I'd buy it again if I had to."
2,B O R I N G,"After listening to this CD, I wanted to return it, because of all the songs on this CD, there are probably 4 of them that I found worth listening to. She does not have much of a voice to begin with, and the arrangements all sound the same with Lee Hazelwood. In all honesty, I cannot give this CD 5 stars. I'm being generous in giving it two stars.."
5,Handel's Sonatas Full of Dramatic Flair,"Unlike some of the other reviewers for this CD, I'm not a harpsichord aficionado. I don't spend my life playing the harpsichord or listening for the subtleties of others' playing, although obviously some here do. I can't speak to Gould's technique; all I can tell you is my impression of Handel's pieces as a whole, which I found to have great dramatic flair. Every movement conveyed so much emotion and power that I constantly found myself disappointed to have finished the CD so quickly. To the extent that I gained such an experience I give Glenn Gould credit for bringing out the pieces' power in his playing."
3,Not a Harpsichordist,"Ummm.....This cd is ok, but Glen's harpsichord technique is terrible. I think he should have had lessons before he played the instrument. I can't doubt that he is a marvelous pianist though."
2,Too Short,It was too short to work with my bass clarinet. I got no use out of it at all. I only give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it could potentially fit with a newer clarinet. Mine is around 30 years old.
2,Mask Looks different than picture shows,"I bought this mask thinking it would match a costume i had custom made a few years back. My old wolf mask was rotting and needed a replacment, The picture they show on here looks kinda close to my mask so i ordered it. I got the mask and was not happy. The colors were pretty far off from the picture. I called to complain and they took my number and said they'd call me back in a few minutes. Never happened. The problem mainly was that the mouth color on the mask is Brown and their is weird brown around the eyes. Barely any silver hair on the mask and the sides and back of mask is Black."
1,Horrible fitting earbuds...,"I can only guess the attraction to these earbuds are the colors. They fit lousy and am constantly having to adjust them. Even Apple's earbuds that come with their Ipods are better than these. I'd send these back if the packaging wasn't such a hassle. I'm glad they weren't very expensive...which I guess justifies the saying ""you get what you pay for""..."
4,Excellent Sound For The Money But....,"For earbuds they have hugh sound quaiilty with decent bass. The clarity and volume level is incredible. The only drawback is the fit. I would say that during a 45min workout at the gym I have to keep placing the earbuds back in my ears an average of about 6 times. Mind you that this is while I weight train only. I can only imagine the nightmare of trying to keep these earbuds in while doing cardio. So if you're not going to be doing too much moving around, i'd say they're great! But if you're going to use them while doing cardio you'd probably want to get something else ."
5,Great earphones for price,These earphones are great for the price. I go to the gym and run a lot and these earphones stay in place when running and are great sound quality and loud(almost to loud at times.)I would recommend them.
5,Excellent value,"These earbuds are comfortable and produce a great sound. The lengthy cord is a bonus.Btw, I almost didn't notice the earbud covers b/c they're tucked inside the cardboard packaging."
5,These earbuds don't fall out of your ears,"These older Sony earbuds have a curved colored plastic piece attached to the ""bud"" that is shaped specifically for the right or the left ear. These earbuds are the only ones that will stay in my ears -- regular round ones fall out moments after I put them in. I think that Sony uses the same model number for ones that don't have the curved colored piece -- I do not know if they have the different shaped buds."
5,Awesome,"These sound better than my dre beats! Great bass, highs, secure fit and nice looking. Win! Get them now ok!"
3,ok ear buds,"I like these ear buds, and bought them to replace a lost pair. I don't like the green color. It is totally diferent than in the picture. It is more of a bright grass green, and i was looking for a light more subtle green. I feel like a little kid with these in my ears. I think I am going to give these to one of my kids and order the white....... they work just fine, but 3 stars for inacurate color in the picture."
2,"These worked great, for a few months.",The mini-jack eventually deteriorates such that any light touch causes noise. These things are incredibly poorly designed and/or manufactured. Avoid. Look elsewhere.
3,You get what you pay for,"The sound quality is okay but there's no acoustic seal so bass is hardly audible. They're alright for the gym and other portable applications, but the problem is you have to turn them up to hear properly. I listen to ambient music as I fall asleep and I'm surprised they haven't broken yet, while all the tossing and turning that goes on in sleep. I've had them since Jan. 2011, so they are quite durable. I would probably recommend them for the price, but I'm seeking a second set with better sound quality."
2,Was unpleased with this product,I have had another set of Sony headphones for about four years but the wire became exposed so I decided to get a new pair. After two weeks of listening to music one of the ear buds started to static. Now listening to music isn't enjoyable due to the constant static over the music.The pair I had four years ago still work perfectly fine so I guess it's just this particular set.
4,longest lasting earbuds I've ever owned,"I am always baffled at how we can send people to space but I can't have a pair of earbuds that stay good for more than 3 months. I expected these to be the same. Honestly, they just quit working today I have had them for at least 5.5 months I honestly can't remember what date I purchased them. I travel a lot so not only do my headphones get abused to some extent but I can't remember the last time I used another pair of earbuds other than these in the last 6 months. The longest Lasting earbuds I have ever had. I've had better sound with one or two other sets but they have never lasted as long, sound is still decent, comfort of the fit is good and it saves on replacing earbuds so often. Worth the money!"
2,Ear bud falls out all the time.,"Sound is O.K. not bad, but they won't stay in my ears.They do not come with any pads or adapters.Big problem."
4,Sony MDR-E10LP/GRN Ear Buds,If you like this type of ear buds they are fine. Only problem is lack of bass. Could be better. Otherwise they are light & comfortable. I tried the ear buds that went all in ear(skull candy) but found you can't hear anything else. Even chewing gum is a problem. So I like ear buds like you get with an ipod. Good for the price if you don't need a heavy bass sound.
3,Recipe for a Great Affair,"This book had a lot of useful information. However, I found it to be a bit outdated."
3,Better than average...,"The stories here are an interesing mix (and anyone familiar with the writer's work will need no clarification of the term interesting). I gave it three out of five as it was better than the average read, as the bulk of the stories are good or better. If you are looking for something to read that is off the map, no holds barred-- ranging from OMG! to tickling at your gag-reflex; you'll likely enjoy The Book Of a Thousand Sins. If you are easily offended (well okay... perhaps just offendable) and/or suffer from a weak constitution--you might probably want to move on."
4,Book Of A Thousand Sins,"This piece put my faith right back into the lap of Wrath James White! The last two entries I had read had disuaded me to purchase on more of his work until I had read more reviews. After doing so I thought this should be the next installment of his work I read. Glad I did, as even a week after reading BOATS I am still plaugued by the haunting images White burns into you mind. (Which is a good thing!) No one is spared here. Babies, Mothers, Werewolves, and Vampires. All are fair game to have immense damage inflicted upon them, and to inflict their own damage upon the world. Well done!"
4,"Unique, very good book on the Sun / Moon house combinations","Contents summary: Introductions (5pp). On the twelve houses (10pp). All 144 possible Sun house / Moon house combinations separately interpreted (130pp). Appendix by Charles Jayne (1p).This book is a good complement to those on Sun / Moon sign combinations, because it interprets the 144 possible Sun / Moon house combinations separately instead. The author is the widow of a highly reputed astrologer, Charles Jayne, and herself writes in an intelligent, concise style. Completely free of examples and other such filler, this is a straight-to-the-point set of delineations. For an briefer alternative view of the 144 separate Sun / Moon house combinations, see 'Planets In Houses' by Robert Pelletier."
3,"interesting, but...","I""m generally a fan of Gould, but this is too often slow,heavy, and pedantic. His dry contrapuntal approach works alright for the first movement, but in the second movement many of the Alberti bass patterns are much too prominent-- as if he were practicing this piece, rather than performing it. Its one of the instances which make you question Gould's intentions."
3,He's no fun - he fell right over,"I have heard (and commited to memory) pretty much everything Firesign ever did and it's a shame to excerpt it. Don't be cheap. Buy them all and in order. Listen in order. You would not read the last book in a series first, would you? Picking bits and pieces of Firesign is the equivalent of reading the last page first.I am waiting for ""The Tale of the Giant Rat of Sumatra"" now that I have read the entirety of Sir A.Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes series. Giant Rat was excellent before but now I expect it to be even richer.Do what I say: I'm not hotdoggin' ya."
1,"Clever, but not very funny","This album was my first exposure to Firesign Theatre after hearing about them from many friends. A ""best of"" collection seemed a good start. Alas, I was disappointed. While some of their wordplay was quite clever, none of the first CD was *funny*. Perhaps it has nostalgia value for some, but for a thirty-something like myself, give me Monty Python or Tom Leaher any day over these guys."
3,A little cumbersome,"Bought this when I was mapping and looking for homes in 2007-2008. The GPS was helpful and low cost compared to prices of a standalone unit back then (especially if you already had a PDA). It did its job. Nowdays, just get a Garmin, Magellen, TomTom, .etc.Pain in the you know what if your PDA software was not user friendly in pairing blue tooth devices (receiver with software). Earthmate GPS unit worked well, but the PDA kept losing its signal blue tooth signal (I blame the PDA). Battery in Earthmate GPS only worked for an hour or two when unplugged from its 12V source."
3,Complicated,"I have taught myself how to use complicated software before and think it is safe to say that this software is not for everyone. Paper based directions would be nice, but they are not included. I called tech support 3 times and waited an hour on hold. The first tech support person told me to ""just use help"" at the top to figure it out. My response- if I dont know the details of what the software does, how do I know what to look up so I know how to use it? His response, ""good question"". A few hours later, I am starting to get used to the software. They should really have a quick overview with basics to get you started. Good luck!"
1,Do not buy this product if you count on searching streetnames on a pda,"This product will not let you search for street names/addresses on a pda ex. palm. Only waypoint, gas stations, etc can be found in a search. Very disappointing product.I got a refund and going for another product."
1,Bull S%#*@,"The Earthmate GPS BT 20 2008 was never delivered to me. But the book was, both had the same address. Amazon gave me a refund, however the GPS software is now more expensive. So either you honor that original price or I will buy it someplace else.Troy"
5,Babysitter Club Fan at 15,"My first Babysitters Club book was when I was 5, my sister used to read them to me. Im almost 16 now and I just can't stop, it's like nicatine I'm addicted. I don't read them as much as I used to, but every once and a while I pick up a book. It's firmilar they are like old friends. I love these books I'll never stop"
5,I'm Ann M. Martin Greatest fan,I LOVE BSC BOOKS!!!! I have read everysingle one. I get all my books from Amazon. I even have The Complete Guide to THE BABY-SITTERS CLUB. That book gives all the information you need to know about the Bsc. I even have every Bsc Doll. I reccomend any of Ann M. Martin's Books. I just hope she doesn't stop making them. The new covers are really neat I have all the Bsc Books and a couple of Karens. I am so glad Ann M. Martin can wright so fast. If Ann M.Martin Reads this E-mail Me Please!!
3,Papermate Is Just Ok,"Papermate pens are ok, but are not the best. I can use one pen in a day witch is bad to me, because I only wrote five pages, and i was out of ink. How is that possible what a disappointment. I thought one pen could at least write 20 pages, but with Papermate i guess not. The only good thing is that they are cheap. The ink comes out great the pen just doesn't last that long. I don't like that after I use the pen for awhile my hand starts to hurt, that's the worse part."
3,"Interesting, but should have ended much before","This is my first time as a reader of Bentley Little's work. The first 200 hundred pages of the book hooked me but then what began as an interesting premise ran out of gas as it became too much of a weird science-fiction story. It seems like Mr Little got too engrossed in wanting to finish the book that he piled event upon event and made it look rather messy and nonsenical towards the end. The first part of the book focused on a true all-too credible everyday horror...it could happen to me, to you, to anyone. We could be simply ""Ignored"" as he puts it. The second part was as if influenced heavily by film director David Lynch. Good imagery, but far too surrealistic and far-fetched...thus blowing what could have been a very good book all around. If Little's books all follow the same kind of style then perhaps I won't read another one of his. It will take me a lot of a goading and persuading if I really must."
5,a book to make you think,i have read almost all off bentley little books and this is one off my favorites. He has a knack to make you wonder if you no someone who feels this way.
3,Social Perspectives,"This book offers a perspective into the human pysche from the end of college to the taking on of a completely unnatural state. The protagonist goes from being a normal character to whom we can all relate to a crazed member of a cult inflicting acts of harm on the very society that formed him into who he is.The story may be a bit drawn out, but illustrates quite effectively the plague of our hero and the enending feeling he himself felt as he went through these motions. As we drift away from the family and friends-centered society that we once were to the consumeristic/capitalistic society we are destined to become, we must be careful to take Little's warnings to heart and seek out to differentiate ourselves - at least to the point that we know who we are."
1,What a really horrible book!,"Lets see, was it the part where the ""ignored"" were invisible when they would start fights? Or maybe the part where the police didn't notice them when they broke into stores? Wait, I think it was where they raped women for casual fun and no one noticed that I finally gave up on this rotten little book, and Bentley Little.This is one of those ""anti-books"" for a younger generation than me. I enjoy Maxx Barry (which is why I think this lousy book was recommended to me) but simply couldn't find a redeeming thing in this book. Maxx Barry is light-hearted and CLEVER. The Ignored is dull, mean-spirited and pointless. I allow a great deal of room for creativity in writing and art, but sometimes you step back and say, ""that isn't art."" This isn't a good book."
2,Dreary little novel,"I found this novel, in a word, dreary. The main character has a dreary passive personality and deliberately leads a dreary life until he meets up with other ""ignoreds"" and they set out to commit one dreary brutality after another. There is a too little, too late surfacing of other worldliness. If this had not been on Stephen King's read list, I wouldn't have finished it."
2,Disappointing,The plot is new..yet..it didnt offer what his other books have.. Kept dragging on with the same reasoning..over and over and over again.
2,The Character Wasn't Average - he was a Loser,"I couldn't finish the book so maybe the 2 star rating is unfair. I did not find the character to be average, I thought he was below average. He was a complainer, a slacker, rude and very insecure. Average people are not like this, they are much more tolerable and basically pleasant. I hated this character. The writing was very good, however, so I can't fault the author on his abilities. I just could not stand the character and to make matters worse, it was written in first person POV. I had to get out of that loser's head! I stopped reading after 2 days."
2,Never got the point!,"I will not elaborate on why I did not like this book because it would take too long. The whole story dragged on and on. I continued reading the story hoping that there would be some sense to it, but that did not happen. Maybe his other books are better, I don't know but I just don't understand how anyone could call ""The Ignored"" a horror book. The only reason I bought this book was because the ratings were good but I guess everyone thinks differently."
3,Interesting Story,"Bentley Little is very good at coming up with unique story ideas. However, especially in this case, the execution comes off as rather stilted. There were several ""clunky"" scenes throughout the novel that could have used a little more editing. I will say that I really could relate to how the protagonist felt at being ignored early in the story. The main idea seemed to tap a vein in self doubt with which the reader could empathize."
4,Ignored. tsk tsk tsk,"Bentley little smokes two barrels with this pastiche of psychotic mayhem, fading reality, and furoring unreality. The plot is one of the craziest ever. It is so original that it can be held as eccentric. The gang of ignored are similar to Tyler Durden's nogooders in Fight Club. The office experiences and dialogue had me laughing to puke. If you're looking for something to keep you awake or fade away, The Ignored is it. Expect the unexpected."
4,Nice existential horror story,"For those of you out there who, upon graduating from college, found yourself in a seemingly dead-end job, where everyone ignores you, this book will strike very close to home. The first few chapters of this book could have been about me. The author goes from there and imagines a world with people who are ""ignored,"" for all intents and purposes, invisible to the rest of the world. It's a nice premise for a story, but seems like maybe not enough for a novel. Consequently the story drags at times, and then gets kinda bizarre at the end. For most horror fans, there's probably not enough traditional horror elements in it, but for those who are interested in reading something a little different, it's fairly entertaining and worthwhile."
2,"Good idea, bad delivery","The idea of this story seemed so cool that I had to read it. However, the writer takes so long setting up the story and then everything moves so sluggishly.... Good characters and great idea but should have been a short story."
5,I LOVED IT!!,"Apparently, this is one of those books you either love or hate. I loved it! Brilliant, perceptive and thought-provoking, it's not for the slice-and-dice crowd, but any educated reader who isn't terrified by the implications of this tale has no soul."
2,The Ignored,I am a very big Bentley Little fan but this was not one of his best works. The story took entirely too long to get to the point and then never seemed to satisfy my anticipation. The ending was very far fetched without any attempt at an explanation.
5,Powerful,"This is the book ""Fight Club"" SHOULD have been. The premise of the two works is similar, but Little follows it to its logical conclusion and creates one of the most powerful and hard-hitting critiques of our contemporary consumer society that I have ever read. A brilliant novel."
2,It would have been best w/fewer pages,"I'm always looking for something to scare me... This isn't 1 of them... I read this a few years back, when Mr. Little was a virtual unknown, except in England, I believe and his books were hard to find... Now they're being reprinted for the masses. He just spent too many pages on the book.. I would have liked it more if it didn't have so many pages, going on & on & on & on & on..........."
1,As average as the bland characters within,"A fascinating premise with loads of potential, however, a very uninteresting development of plot and characterization. What was the worst thing about _The Ignored_ is not that it really was such a bad horror novel, but that Bentley Little has ruined the concept for every other horror novelist with more talent and devotion. And the redundancy? Page after page after page of being reminded exactly what the diagnoses are for this lot of losers that Little chose to leave as stagnant and boring card-board cut-outs of every American breathing in the here and now.I'm just sorry I bought it instead of borrowing it from the library. I suggest you ignore this book and move on to better novels. What little faith I have left in Little will go toward a second chance - I hope that his novel _The House_ is better than _The Ignored_. Again, interesting concept, albeit traditional - but we'll see where it goes."
3,Beware - only five new songs,"I'm an ardent fan of Barbara Lynn and enjoyed this new CD which is finally available without the high price for the Japanese edition on V-PineUnfortunately, out of the thirteen tracks there are only five new songs, ""I Got Love If You Want It"", ""I'm Not Doing Nothing Wrong"", ""Long Gone"", ""Matt's Hatt"" (instrumental) and ""Movin' On A Groove"". This policy is not new for Barbara Lynn as many of her CDs contain new recordings of previously released material. The new songs are similar in feel to most of her other work so you'll know what to expect if you are a Barbara Lynn fan. I would have rated this CD higher had there been more new material ... but nonetheless it's great to hear the lady again"
5,Perfect Sand Volleyball,I bought this ball after looking extensively at what pros play with. This ball is really nice!!! Good grip. Really soft! If you're looking for a V-ball. This is the one I'd buy every single time.
2,Water Volleyballs,This ball would not stay inflated. I purchased 3 of them and found they 2 went flat after a week of use.
2,Love the Ball but it Didn't Last Long!,"I bought this ball because of the reviews on Amazon. I wasn't going cheap. I wanted a soft and quality outdoor v-ball. I purchased it just over 60 days ago but used it for my first ""real"" game a couple days ago. I bumped it with a few family members the first 60 days (but I bet the ball has 1 hour of bump time before I used it for an actual game). It lasted two hours and the air hole popped out...so I cannot pump it up with air anymore. The ball is toast. Everyone loved the ball. Maybe I got a lemon. I will order a different one next time as Amazon only gives you 30 days to return this item. So I'm stuck tossing it in the trash and starting from scratch."
2,"Not a great ball, not worth the money","I order this ball based on the reviews saying it was a great beach volleyball, etc. I don't know if the production has changed or something (most those reviews are 5+ years old) but this ball is not that great. Better than the low end balls you'll find in a retail store, but not by much, especially not for the price. I've played beach volleyball for 5+ years and this is not a ball I'd pick to play with. Looks like I'll be ordering the official AVP ball for a few dollars more."
3,NOT Super Soft,"This volleyball says super soft on it. It's no softer than a normal volleyball. Super soft is false advertising. Other than that, it does seems to be of good quality construction."
5,Excellent,This is an excellent ball. It has a very nice feel and is a pleasure to play with. I would reccomend this ball to anyone wanting a high quality affordable ball.
2,Problem with durability,"This ball is the one we all like for its feel and control. While the two balls we purchased held together, they were the best. We play once or twice a week and, after about six months, seam leaks started showing up.We bought another because we liked it so much but hopefully this one will last longer."
4,A good buy,"This bezel looks darker than the photo. It only appears bluish under strong light. My room lighting is darker and most people would look at it and think it's black. So if you're tired of waiting for a reasonable price on the black bezel, this will do. The LCD looks much much better with a dark bezel than the silver. It really brings out the floating screen effect.You have to remove ten small screws which have a non-standard head and are all recessed in nooks and crannies. It's hard to get a bite on the screws so you can make the job a lost easier if you can turn the TV completely around. Otherwise expect some cramping and cursing. Once you've got the screws out, the replacement is easy and the screws are easy to put back in because they can be ""fixed"" on the supplied screwdriver."
2,What's all of this waiting about?,"OK the remote works fine in communicating with the camera and all of that, but it has a big drawback for me and something I wish I had found out before I purchased it. You have to wait for a 2sec delay after you push the shutter button on the remote for the camera to fire. There are other remotes for Canon DSLR's that are right at the same price and give you the option of firing with you click the button or to have a 2 second delay. Trust me having both options is way better than being limited to just one of them."
5,Simple and effective.,"The Canon RC-5 does what it promises: remotely trigger the shutter. Keep in mind that there is a 2 second delay between pressing the button and the shutter action. This allows you, if you are in the field of view, to put your hand down and hide the remote so that it is not in the shot."
2,"Simple, but cheap . . .","I like the idea - I like how compact it is. But you've got to be standing in front of the camera to use it. The range is not great either. I had to read all of what it actually did online, because mine arrived broken. Disappointed."
2,remote controller,A significant disadvantage with the remote is that you have an extremely short time to set up your shot before the camera goes into sleep mode and the remote won't turn it back on.
4,"In the picture, without a sweat.","It's a decent product for the price.Pros:1) Don't have to run for the camera every time you need to take a picture.2) Simple to set up, just set it to timer.3) It can fit in any camera bag.Cons:1) Doesn't play well with multiple canon cameras on site.2) MAKE SURE YOU ALREADY HAVE A TRIPOD FIRST.3) Still hard to use in a crowded area.number 1 is the only valid con. When you have a Rebel XT and a Rebel XSi, one remote works for both, which messes with both the flash gauges. Other then that rare possibility, it is a really good device,"
3,Oops: almost useless to me,"Like lots of other customers I had not read the specs before my purchase and expected it to let me take instant snaps... Well, I was wrong:there's that delay before the camera fires.But what sets me apart from many of the customers here is that I like using the mirror up function, for pictures with a long telephoto lens.The delay that you get between the raising of the mirror and the firing of the camera is just not long enough, especially if you are doing a vertical frame,as you require about 10 seconds to have the camera really stable.Well, it's not the infrared controller's fault: it's the camera's."
2,Cute sandals. Exspensive though.,I'm in the process of returning them. I'm waiting for a return slip to come in the mail.I tryed to cancel while in the process of ordering and couldn't so they were sent when I actually didn't want them to.They arrived in perfict condition.
1,Serenade,I bought this album and had it replaced by Amazon. Unfortunately both CDs had tracks 24 and 25 corrupted - ruined the album. Don't buy. Amazon does a great job trying to help correct a manufacturer's GOOF!
5,This boxed set shows a legendary country star at her best.,"Tears of Fire the boxed set by Tammy Wynette shows the late legend of country music at her best. From the heart-wrenching emotion of the self-penned 'Til I Can Make It On My Own' to the tongue-in-cheek playfulness of 'Another Chance', the entire set is a winner. The three CD set contains songs from the early sixties to the mid eighties and includes a twenty-six page book of extensive notes and pictures that put the songs in historical perspective. There are also duets with George Jones, Emmylou Harris and others that highlight the versatility of the First Lady of Country Music. There is some filler in this boxed set and not all the included songs are classics -- but the set is a must-have for any fan and anyone who enjoys the best that classic Country Music has to offer."
5,Love it!,"If you are a Tammy Wynette fan, you should get a set of her CDs and this is a very good one!"
1,waste of money,"don't be fooled by the five star reviews, this product is a complete waste of money. the applicator has centered exactly one label so far. that was the very first label I had applied and it has yet to properly apply another. you are much better off eyeballing it, or maybe rigging an empty cd/dvd spindle to do it yourself. whatever you do, don't waste your money on this item."
1,Bad news.,It seems one must have the best printer money can buy to get this to work properly. I've used label making software on other PCs and never had as much trouble as I have with Memorex's. Getting labels to line up properly is impossible. I have now printed 5 sheets of CD labels and they are in two different positions relative to the label itself on every sheet.This was a waste of money. Avoid it at all costs. There has to be better out there than this.
2,It's okay...,"I was excited to try this vacuum because it was bagless. I don't really like to give a bad review, because I don't really enjoy negativity, but for all of the people who have given this good reviews, probably didn't have a good vacuum before it. It loses suction rather fast, I have to vacuum over certain things a million times before I finally just reach over and pick it up with my hands. It does terribly on hard floors, it spits everything back at your feet. And we have huge area rugs in the living room and office, and the vacuum does not work at all on these rugs. I actually have to tilt the vacuum up in the air a little bit in order for it to not get stuck on the rugs. The nice features of this vacuum are that it's bagless, and you don't have to buy any new bags, but you make up for it in buying new filters and such. And the self propelling action on regular carpet is wonderful as well."
5,Love it,"My wife and I both love this vacuum cleaner. We tried another brand after our Bissell kicked the dirt (no pun intended) and were very dissatisfied. The Hoover, however, did not disappoint! Relatively quiet operation (in comparison to most cleaners), excellent cleaning power, and that little red/green light that tells you when all the dirt has been picked up make this thing almost fun to use. Highly recommended!"
1,Worst vacuum I've owned (by FAR!!),"My wife and I have been through FOUR of this vacuum in the past 18 months! Seriously...FOUR!! Kudos to Wal-Mart for being so willing to exchange them for us, but this is ridiculous. We have no children and 2 cats. It's not like we're running a day-care here or anything! Each of the 4 have been great out of the box, but haven't made it beyond 8 or so uses. Two of them broke (one on the handle, and the other on the bottom wheels), and the other 2 just literally died! The one that just died is still smoking as I write this. 5 years ago, you used to be able to buy an AWESOME vacuum (i.e. Phantom) for $150...now it seems that you must spend $300+...so be it...but NOT with Hoover!"
4,"Hoover Bagless System - ""The Belt Thrower""","For the price this is a fairly good vacuum. The only problem we are having is that it continues to throw the belt. That's quite an inconvenience to have to stop, disassemble, reattach the belt, re-assemble and move on. We have tried adjusting the height, etc (thinking it was set too low and putting undue stress on the belt) but that hasn't made a difference. When the belt is operating correctly, the vacuum has great suction and works well."
1,Cheap... Not worth it,"Unless they have drastically improved the V2, I would look else where. My V2 is about 2 1/2 years old and has stopped working. The spindle for the brushes is plastic. With in 6 mos of owning, those rounded out and had to be replaced. The brush ends that holds the brushes in place are plastic, have melted and needs to be replaced. Now something else has broken (I'm sure plastic) and it no longer works. I have a Hoover vacuum that is not that old and is now worthless."
5,Great Vacuum,This is the best vacuum that I have owned so far. I had an old piece of crap that I had bought from Sears about 2 years. This one was free and it works great. It was easy to assemble and I love the fact that it is bag less. The filters are kind of pricey but they are worth it. I use it to vacuum my entire house. You can use this vacuum on almost any surface of the house.
2,"It works, but too loud and cost too much","I don't like this vaccum. I won't buy it. It DOES in fact suck up a lot. The floors are clean, of course I make messes. It cost too much $$, as most vaccums in this class are a lot cheaper. Plus it's really loud, and hurts my ears. Overall, get something else."
1,I would not buy,I bought my Hoover Wind Tunnel a little over a year ago. I have experienced many problems. The biggest one being how cheaply it is made. The hose doesn't fit properly into the back of the machine so I am constantly having to get my screw driver out in order to fix. It's now broken so that it will not sit upright anymore. The hook broke off when I caught the edge of the table as I was pulling the vacuum backwards. It wasn't a hard bump either. It's very heavy too and hard to move around on the carpet. My upstairs and down stairs is hardwood flooring. It's never done very good with picking up debris off of the hardwood floors. It's just been a really big disappointment as a vacuum and I am now in the process of having to go buy another vacuum. I wish I had had a better experience because I thought hoover was a good company. Everything just seems so cheap with the model. Like it could fall apart at any second. The attachments don't stay on well either.
4,easy to use / does a good job,"This vacuum replaced a dyson and for the price, I am pleased with it's performance. I have 2 dogs & 2 cats and the attachment works well getting hair off of furniture. I empty the filters outside / gently bang it on a tree - you would make a mess inside."
1,Poor Built Quality. Terrible suction.,"Hoover Used to make Good Vacuum What Happened?Here are Some of the Problems I encountered:1- Cleaning of Canister is very messy. Every time you open the lid to throw dust, the filter fell out with a cloud of dust of dust.2- The spring loaded door which which control suction between main vacuum and hand tool, will break with in one week since itts made of very thin plastic. Once broken, hand tool is useless.3- Vacuum belt is very hard to get.4- Need to replce belt every 3 month or so.5- Cleap quality utility Cover.POOR design in General."
4,Hoover WindTunnel Bagless,Great vacuum cleaner--definitely worth it. I got an awesome price through Amazon.
2,Not Covered by Hoover Warranty,"I bought this vacuum and used it 2 times. The second time I vacuumed my carpet and it did a wonderful job, but I used the hand tools and because the agitator still runs during this time, the belt broke and melted all the plastic and part of the bristles to the brush, I had bits of burnt plastic imbeded in the carpet where it was sitting. I call the warranty dept. and they said because it tells you in the hand book that the agitator still runs while using the hand tools that it was NOT covered. So why have the hand tool attachments if you can't use them? I do NOT recommed this item for that simple fact. I am returning the vacuum and WILL NOT by another Hoover if they refuse to honor their warranties."
1,BAGLESS-NEVER AGAIN,"Emptying the bagless u5753-900 hoover vacuum cleaner creates a bigger mess that before you vacuumed. The minute particles of dust captured in the filter are almost impossible to remove without creating a dust cloud. Additionally, you need the strength of hercules to push it forward and pull it back.I just purchased this vacuum and have already ordered a bag-type."
2,Don't Buy A Hoover!! Very Poor Customer Service,If you need a new belt good luck getting one. Turns out the Hoover Wind tunnel is being recalled. If you email the company you will not get a response. If you call them it's a toll call. I've called to get my free belt and no luck! turns out the compoany has been sold to ttigroup in Hong Kong. I sent an email to the CEO Mr. Pudwill. Let's hope I get a response. I'll never buy another Hoover!!! Another once great Americn company bites the dust!!
4,I love this vacuum!,"I really love my vacuum! Other reviews have not been so kind, and have mentioned how messy it is to clean the dirt container, but I don't find it any problem to speak of.. It is a little dusty, but not that bad! The neat thing for me is, it makes it ALMOST fun to vacuum, as I can see how much cat hair I'm picking up and it is amazing. I'd recommend this to anyone!"
2,I used to like vacuuming...,"Now I am just annoyed with it. I agree with everyone else on this page who has had problems with this vacuum. I am amazed that I have the exact same problems! I wish I would have known all this before I bought it a year ago. Belts pop off, hose pops out while you're vacuuming, it's VERY noisy, it's VERY messy to empty the canister/filters (all that dust gets back into the air!), and the hard floor setting spits dirt back at you instead of sucking. I am very disappointed in this vacuum. Not what I would have expected from a Hoover. Probably the most annoying thing about this vacuum is the noise. I can't wait to find a vacuum that is QUIET and easy to maintain so vacuuming becomes fun again."
2,Great suction / bad vacuum,"I bought mine only 6 months ago and have replaced the belt several times. When using the attachment hose, the brushes keep turning and the motor gets hot. I was able to vacuum 5 stairs with the attachment when the vacuum shut off completely. After about two hours, I turned it on again and it started smoking. Smelled up the whole house! It is awful to dump the dust out of the canister. Like the others have said, one small gust of wind and you come in needing a shower.On the plus side, it does have great suction and gets up all the dog and cat hairs. The carpets looks great after vacuuming (if the vacuum makes it through the room).Thanks for listening."
4,Hoover U5753 WindTunnel Vacuum,Great product really sucks up the dirt but is a little noisy. Rather have clean than quiet.
4,Great buy!,Great product for the price. This product has great suction power and works great on all floor surfaces.
1,Loses Suction,"I don't know how anyone could really like this vacuum. The ONLY thing I like about it is that it's bagless...but that's the first drawback. It loses suction, and by the time I'm done with my 800 square foot condo, it probably has something like 1/4 of the initial suction. Then, you have to dump the cannister, tap the dust off the paper filter, then wash both the paper filter and the metal screen. They say you can only wash the paper filter a couple of times, but I've washed mine over two dozen times (just be sure to let it dry). Not sure how CR could rate this a good vacuum....The hose doesn't stay put in the holder, and this causes additional loss of vacuum. Also, the brush spins even when its in the locked upright position and you're using the hose.....grrrr......"
4,Hoover Vac... COOL!!!!!!,"It works really GREAT !!!! Gets the dirt up and out of the rugs Just one small thing bugged me though, Wish it had a much longer hose like my old Hoover or that that hose would have fit the new hoover... LOL I am very happy with it though. But let's see if I am still feeling like this in a year after it has been used.."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS VACUUM!,"I wish I had read the abundant number of negative reviews of this vacuum prior to purchasing one. Similar to many of the other complaints, my vacuum only lasted approximately one year. I emailed Hoover's public relations department and they forwarded me to a Hoover repair store. The repairs were going to be more than $150. A new motor, among other things, was needed. So, I told the repairman that he can just throw it in the trash; comparable to what other previous Hoover vacuum owners have done.READ ALL OF THE REVIEWS.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS VACUUM.DO NOT PURCHASE ANY PRODUCT FROM HOOVER."
3,You can tell the magic is gone...,"This album is so anti-climactic after over a decade of producing some of the most beautiful music. I can't help but this that a producer from the record label said, OK, let's make them appeal to a wider audience... well, Lisa was already on her way to her own thing and Brendan Perry, well he remains my hero. I don't recommend this over any of their earlier works. In fact, if you don't want to start at the beginning at least pick up ""Passage in Time"" which is infinitely better."
5,R.I.P.,"A more percussive approach to DCD music with this release than previous efforts but equally as entertaining and emotional as anything they've ever committed to tape, as well.A fine, fine swansong for Brendan and Lisa ... Highly recommended!!But could someone please tell me why they might even remotely think of this band as ""goth""???? This makes no sense to me whatsoever ..... or am I missing something here? Hmmmm ....R.I.P., DCD!"
2,Worst DCD album,"If you are new to Dead Can Dance, please do yourself a favor and don't buy this album, which is by far the worst album they have ever recorded. It shows DCD's lack of new ideas and reworking of tired ones. You should start with _Within the Realm Of A Dying Sun_ or _The Serpents Egg_ instead."
5,One of the most Beautiful CD's ever...,"I know this CD gets bad reviews because it didn't push the Dead Can Dance sound any further, but it is simply too amazing to dislike. I own a few Dead Can Dance albums, from different points in their career and Spiritchaser is by far my favorite one. The Native American style drumbeats and vocals (and Lisa Gerrard's beautiful voice) make this album great. Drumbeats that almost make you want to dance, guitar and synth lines that compliment Lisa's stunning voice...it all makes for a classic album. This being Dead Can Dance's last album, it was a good way to sum up their excellent career."
3,"NOT HORRIBLE, BUT DEFINITELY NOT GREAT EITHER.","compared to other dcd albums this is unremarkable, the production is too polished and plastic and the magic is gone...i would say this is for completists only, by any other dcd album before this. any hardcore dcd will tell you that WITHIN THE REALM OF A DYING SUN, THE SERPENTS EGG, and AION are there three best records and if you've never heard dcd before i would strongly recommend picking up one or all of those. i would even say lisa gerrards solo albums are much better than this record. you could tell brendan was going downhill when listening to spiritchaser, you'll know what i'm talking about if you hear this cd or his subsequent solo record (which is horrible, and deserves only 2 stars at best)."
5,A latecomer's plea,"This is all good stuff. I only started listening to DCD a year or so ago, and have worked my way through the catalog. 'Spiritchaser' is some distance from 'In the Realm of a Dying Sun', but I listen to both with equal amounts of pleasure. As a final offering,'Spiritchaser' is terrific. Wonderful African/Antipodean instrumentation with great vocal performances. Perfect music for long night drives. I love the final track...Lisa Gerrard at her inimitable best."
3,Good album,"My tastes in music has changed and this is a bit dark for me now. It was great when I was into it, but when my tastes changed this one didn't stick around in my collection. So, I would never qualify it as a 'classic'."
5,A Monument of Music,"Their last one - and one of the best, for sure. This duo has single-handedly created a genre of its own which they inhabit almost by themselves. And at the last moment they gave as yet a new direction, more into tribal and latin spheres. Nevertheless, this IS Dead Can Dance: Their mood, their melodies, their voices are ever present. Listen to it more than once, more than twice - and you will find them. From ""Within the Realm of a Dying Sun"" to ""Aion"" to ""Into the Labyrinth"" to ""Spiritchaser"" they have conquered the world and will forever stay with us."
4,Products Purchased Online,"It's sleek, attractive, and very useful. The clasped cord makes it a real carry and go-getter!"
2,I'M STILL WAITING...,"I'm still waiting...to figure out what I'm missing since this book obviously doesn't deliver what the cover blurbs promise. While I enjoyed the character sketches and amusing interludes of the narrator's neighbors, the book went nowhere. When I finished the novel, it was to a ""you gotta be kidding me"" reaction. No guts, no glory."
1,Terrible!,"This is a terrible movie. I got it because I am a Tom Savini fan, and his performance was fine. The rest of the movie was poorly paced, written, and went nowhere!If you are looking for naked chicks with bad teeth rolling around on the ground and biting guys - have at it!"
2,Only One thing Good About This Movie...,"The only thing good about this movie is the abundance of nudity. The demon girls are totally naked through the whole film, and even that became a little weak after a while. It just needed a few things, like more full-frontal, more acting, more plot, more money, more script, and more direction. Then we'd have had a hit on our hands. Seriously though, unless you can get it for $5.00 or less, don't waste your time."
1,What the Heck?,"I watched this movie, I was not impressed. I was not expecting a block buster, but something which could at least be followed, The ending was disappointing and left me waiting for the next scene in the movie. The ending to me seemed like they just ran out of money and quit shooting. I mean, It just ended and nothing was resolved. I watched through the credits, there were some jumbled scenes as they rolled and I half expected this to resolve some of my questions. It did not. Could have been much more."
4,Too fat for the living room,The VGA cable works fine and serves the purpose. I could connect my laptop to my TV and have everyone in the room view the computer on the TV while we worked on a planning session for a wedding. But the cable itself is a bit fat and heavy - not something you want to leave in your living room when you are done. Definitely would still have got it for serviing its purpose though. PNM.
4,Inexpensive and works well,"This cable does what it is supposed to - solve the problem that machine and monitor is far apart. I use it during installation and troubleshooting on servers and embedded systems.Typically I run it at low resolutions and video quality is perfect. I have not run it at higher resolutions, but the cable seems to be of good quality and I expect it will do reasonably well. However if you run it at higher resolution, don't expect the same quality as you would get with a very short cable."
5,Got what I needed,"I use this to watch videos like Hulu on my TV. TV uses a composite port for the vga component input, and it works just fine."
1,Image was blurry,I connected this to a monitor. The image was blurry (the image was fine when it was connected to another cable). Would not recommend this.
5,Great Cable!!!,"I just connected the projector to the pc, and it worked perfectly. What else can I say about it? The materials and its assembly seem extremely good. If I need another cable like this or similar I will not hesitate to buy another one from this company.And the price was very affordable. I've bought similar cables, and the price were almost doble. I'm pretty satisfied with this one."
3,My Monitor Flickers,"... I plugged this wire in and the picture was good for 3 minutes, then my monitor kept flickering, going black, then clear, black then clear. So... don't know what's up with my wire. Guess i wasted my money on this."
1,Cable came much thinner than picture showed,They must have cheapened out on these cables as I got a tiny super thin cable that is just utterly horrid quality. I don't even think the cable has ANY shielding as the cable is so incredibly thin (less than half the thickness as picture shows) and the display quality is atrocious. Get the Belkin Pro cable it is 1000x better! You've been warned.
2,Received defective cable,"Unfortunately I received a defective cable. Monitor was blurry, so i tested each pin end to end and found 1 not connected on the other end. Amazon refunded my purchase. Ended up buying a replacement locally as, at this point, I now needed the cable right away."
1,defective: what happened to quality control?,"Used it to connect my HP Pavilion laptop to an LG 65"" 3D HD television. I connected both ends and saw....nothing. TV indicated there was no SVGA input. Tried restarting and then rebooting the computer to force a signal out. Still nothing.As a sanity check, I took another SVGA cable from a working desktop computer and tried it. The old cable worked beautifully straight away without any restarting or rebooting and the computer desktop was displayed in sharp exquisite detail on the television.Then I tested the shipped cable using an ohm meter and discovered 4 out of 15 pins were either not wired or were mis-wired! (All 15 pins of the old cable worked.)Left the impression that seller is peddling equipment from a manufacturer whose quality control is seriously deficient."
2,Already shorting out,This was used in the conference room to display laptops on the LCD TV. We've only had this cable a few months and unless you jiggle or tweak it just right it only displays red or green.I won't be buying from these guys again.
4,The Best set I have overall,In my view the best set of Op4. Better than Pinnock/Preston/English Concert and the AAM/Egarr and Collegium Aureum/ Ewerhart. See my review of AAM/Egarr for more detail. I admit I have only 3 other sets but probably more than most. Light on its feet with nimble Church organ ( some mechanical noises )Nicely judged and played. I did not like it so much on first listening but it grew on me. No problem with Opus 7 either and still better than Pinnock and at least the equal of Van Asperen - the latter let down by a curious background rushing noise inthe recording but otherwise excellent particularly the quicker movements. Slimline 2cd set.
