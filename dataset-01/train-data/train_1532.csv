2,One-sided view,"Writing as Sharon's ""media advisor"" and defender in the court of public opinion, Uri Dan is attempting to build a strong case for the actions Sharon took when he was a general and was accused of questionable military tactics. What I took away from this book was how unfair the legal system can be. Sharon had a judge blatanly biased in his favor. This is clearly desribed by the personal involvement the judge took on his behalf. He had the highest paid legal talent at his beck-n-call for free. He came across in this description as a mean-spirited ""do it my way or else"" type person. Reading the book many years after the fact, it appears the very reason he denied pursuing the suit against ""Time"" magazine was his true intent all along, i.e., to make a name for himself politically."
4,pleased,"I haven't begun studying the book yet, but it was received in a great time frame and appears to be in great condition. Thanks!"
5,"a ""must read""","This is a great book and I would recommend it for anyone, then read it again, it's awesome!!"
2,the cd single for Delerium is better,"I didn't like this song much -- it seems to go nowhere and I am a fan of low-key electronica. The guitar sounds generic and the beats are non-descript. Delerium however is a better single and the CD single has some interesting remixes, including one by fila brazilia."
5,My kids really connected to this story,"My 3 year old boy/girl twins love this story, I do too. One of the reasons why we like it so much is the realistic behavior and feelings of Janet and Jimmy. Ms. Cleary writes stories that capture the essence of how children see and interact with the world. Everything that happens in this book makes perfect sense to preschoolers. My children still listen to every word and are still thrilled with the ending every time we read it!"
5,great for reading aloud over and over again!,"My children loved this and all the other Beverly Cleary picture (and chapter books). I cannot even say how many times we have read it, as well as The Read Hole, Growing Up Feet, and Janet's Thingamagig. I can see this story actually happening with small children, and I know Mrs. Cleary based this series on her own twins. The illustrations are very cute, also."
1,Bad mixing old and new music instruments - Dupplicate CD...,"Be carefull..... this CD is a dupplication of 2 other CDs with different titles, they are: ""Traditional Music From Vietnam"" and ""Greetings From Vietnam"". Here is the review from ""Greetings From Vietnam"":""If you are expecting an authentic Vietnamese traditional music, this CD is not a right one for you. Ten out of 20 songs (2, 4, 7, 10 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and 20) are playing by the Western guitar, not the Vietnamese traditional music instruments. This constraint ""marriage"" is very unpleasant to listen to."""
4,It's a shame about the music...,"Great show, but just not the same without the music. Wish they could've at least afforded a COVER of Paint It Black for the theme song. All the same, worth the purchase."
2,Tour of Duty DVD,"Tour of Duty Fans beware of this product. The original music (Jimi Hendrix, CCR, Marvin Gaye etc)which significantly contributed to the quality of the TV series has been replaced in the DVD version with terrible generic music. I loved the original series but wish I had my money back on this product!!"
4,I'm not Jumping the Gun on Buying Just Yet,"With the U.K. version being released with original music soundtrack just over a year ago and now the U.S. going out of print, I'm betting that the US version will be re-released with the original music in the near future. If the original score isn't that important to you, there seems to be some very good closeout prices on the remaining seasons 1 & 2 right now. Guess we can just keep our fingers crossed and see what happens."
2,Another DVD mistake...,"I loved this series. I saw this at Best Buy and grabbed it immediately. Poped in the first disc and low and behold the Rolling Stones were not there to get me pumped up. So yes I was that poor sap who got taken.It's very unfortunate that the original music is not there. If I can ""steal"" all these songs off the net in mp3 format, why the heck can't studios secure the rights for the original music? Seems so backwards to me. A job done poorly.Season two doesnt have the orignal music either. There are too many of these TV shows on DVD that have not been done correctly. It's really a shame if you ask me."
2,"Sorry, it's just not the same w/out the music","I eagerly awaited the delivery of this great series which was aired in Singapore about a year after it came out in the US and wish I had taped it way back then. After getting about half way through the 3rd episode, I had heard enough of the artificial electronic muzak that sounds out-of-place with the era. If you watched this series when it came out and enjoyed the mood it set, this will make you feel that something is now missing. I have ordered Season 2 but it has not arrived and I will throw both out if Season 2 is the same. I hope the DVD producer can work out whatever problem they have with the music or copyright."
4,Music,I really hope they plan on putting the music in for the next (that is if they decide to) season. It really changes the mood of the show. I feel that music can make or break a TV show or movie. If the people that made the DVD set are reading this please add the music if you decide to do another release. I would even have paid an extra 15$ for the music. If it had the proper music it would recive a well deserved 5 stars but due to the music issue I have to just give it 4 stars. The sound quality & video quality are great & I have no complaints about anything else.
4,WAR CLASSIC,I AM A WAR MOVIE BUFF. THIS IS A MUST-HAVE FOR MY COLLECTION. I PLAN ON BUYING THE WHOLE SERIES.
4,Tour of Duty,Love it! Would be perfect with the orignal soundtrack!! Miss the Rolling Stones and Paint It Black!!! But if you enjoyed Tour of Duty on TV bought it anyway. I have all three seasons!
5,Glad to have it no matter what kind of music,"I remember when this series first aired and I taped every single episode to VHS. Unfortunately I didn't keep them due to frequent moves. Since I haven't seen this program since it went off the air, the only familiar theme music I noticed was at the beginning which appears to be the music used for the end credits. I recognized it immediately. It would have been nice to have the original music, but if this is all we can get then I'm still pleased. It's better than nothing at all.I didn't even know this series had been released to DVD. I seem to miss a lot of releases. I ordered Season One and Two early Wednesday morning and received it the next day. I was surprised at how quickly it arrived.I always liked this series because it was the most authentic Vietnam series at the time. China Beach was also a good series, but Tour of Duty will always be my favorite."
5,Tour of Duty - The Complete First Season,"As good as my husband remembers it from watching it in first-run primetime. I'm new to the show, but have found (from what I've studied) it to be a good depiction of the soldier's life in Vietnam. Great character development, you actually care about each character and are rooting for them, no matter your views on the conflict itself."
5,Tour of Duty - Definite in my collection,"I love war movies and tv shows about all the wars America has been involved in. This is one of my favorite tv episodes of all time. I remember watching it each and every week when I was younger. I was so excited when I got the set that I watched the entire set within a two week period. That was about 2 months ago, I'm starting over again.It's not a dvd that I would let my 3 and 6 year olds watch, but it's definitely one that I will enjoy for years to come. I can't wait until the next season comes out."
3,"NOT the ""COMPLETE"" 1st Season!","This is being sold under false pretenses.It says on the cover ""The Complete 1st Season"". This is not true. It has been hacked to pieces. After contacting TNT Headquarters in Atlanta, Ga after it was pulled off the air in the United States I uncovered the truth. As a direct result of the Bush Administrations request, the music tracks were changed and the show was literally banned from airing on television in the US. TNT says the reason for theese changes were due to requests from the government in light of the September 11 attacks. This series shows all too clearly the ""human side"" of war and posed a conflict of interest to the new LIE called the ""War on Terror"". Anyone who would even consider voting for shrub, or his Nazi American Terror Organization (The Republican Party), should have their head examined. After all, its a ""FREE"" country right? Give me a break. Another victory in the War on Terror. Enjoy folks."
1,What did they do?,The original score was replaced with the most blan music possible. Paint it Black really set the tone for this series but now you drift off just listening to the boring music. Was a waste of money!
2,Needs the original music,"It just isn't the same with the original music. Guess they couldn't use the music because of some copywright law or another, but the original music really added something vital to the series. I found the series bland with the music change."
2,A Sea of Corn,"Forget the music. Season 1 is a compilation of every stereotypical and cliche'd ""bad scene"" from every war movie or series you've seen since the beginning of time, but on a special effects deprived budget. A sea of cheap corn with the occasional cheese thrown in. Sorry folks, but I would not recommend.Second star is for the 1000 minutes of DVD time which is a bit more entertaining than commercials."
1,Great Series Suffers without Soundtrack,"Outstanding series about the Vietnam War, but missing the original soundtrack - this is wrong. It's like a body without a soul. I'll not be purchasing any of the other seasons. Hope they re-release with the original music."
1,Disappointed fan,I have been a fan of Tour of Duty since it first appeared and Iwas thrilled to see the DVD set available. When I discovered that the original music was removed I was shocked. It is part of the experience that was the original series. I will not purchase something that is only a part of what it was intended to be. I hope the second season is released as it was intended. I would gladly pay for the DVD's (even if they were more expensive) if they appear as originally broadcast.
1,Not So Complete Season 1,"Well, well, well. The excitement at seeing the release of this great show was shattered by the news that the original soundtrack would not be included. Good thing I was able to cancel my order before the release date. Why would the studio put this show out with re-dubbed music? I am fully aware that there are royalty issues and what-not, but how can the creators of the show and all parties involved allow this show to be desecrated in this manner? Do they not have any pride? This cannot be accurately described as the complete season one, if a part of the original product is missing. Maybe this version will cause enough outrage that in the future a truly ""complete"" issue will be released. Until then, I will have to rely on the fond memories I have of the original show I saw as a kid in the late eighties. This DVD release gets one star for now until the music is rectified."
3,Incomplete,"I would pay twice the price if the music was included. As a USMC Vietnam vetern who served in RVN during that time (1966-67) I feel that the episodes dealt with every aspect of the Vietnam experience and did it well, although the improbabilities are easy to spot if you've been there. The music was important, punctuating the events in profound and moving ways. It is incomplete without the original score. To the publishers (and I am sure speaking for my fellow ""Tour"" fans): do it right and charge more. We will pay the price for the real thing."
4,"Awesome, except for lack of music and terrence knox acting","I remember watching this back in the 80s and it was very cool watching those hueys zoom by. I'm glad the series is out on DVD and I still enjoy watching it. I'd rather have it with generic music than not have it at all.The acting, on the other hand is not the best. T.Knox especially is atrocious. Have you seen the one where they save the baby? I mean what kind of acting school did he go to anyway? Did they just pick him up from the street? I guess he came cheap, like all tv actors usually do. Another annoying little tidbit is teh fact that T.Knox hardly ever puts on his helmet, while everybody else does. Oh well, at leat I can criticize it while I'm watching it on DVD. Lets hear it for the 80s."
1,hope someone listens,Without the original soundtrack this is worthless.....I'm glad I read thru these reviews...I won't be buying this much to my sadness. The people who put this out must be morons. In my mind this is a giant RIP-OFF.
2,TOUR OF DUTY,This was a great series but i dont under stand why they have taken out all the early music and added the library rubbish. Why not just release it as it was 1st layed out. SHAME COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT SET OF DVDS.
2,Original Music,"I've had this set in my wish list for a long time and was about to purchase, when I read a few reviews and came to find out that they omitted the original music score for the set. Hello!!!, but am I wrong or what, didn't this set the mood for the series."
1,Not without the original soundtrack!,"Sadly, I have to agree with many of the comments posted before. As much as I had looked forward to owning ""Tour of Duty"" on DVD I refuse to buy it unless it features the original soundtrack. It just wouldn't be the real thing. And so the one-star rating naturally does not reflect on the series itself but only to the careless way in which it was released."
1,Vote With Your Dollars,"I've seen the episodes on TNT without the original music and the music substituted is like elevator music compared to the orignal track. I WILL NOT buy any DVD set without the original music, and I would have bought this series in a heartbeat - but no sale."
1,No music = No Purchace,"I was so excited about Tour of Duty coming to DVD. But when I heard the original music would not be included I decided there would be no way I would give these lazy people my money. I will continue to watch the original episodes I recorded off CBS. And how will they handle Episede 5:""Sitting Ducks"" when the guys start singing ""Louie Louie"" and then the ORIGINAL music kicks in? Or ALL of season 3 with McKay blasting ORIGINAL music from his chopper? WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!"
4,The music makes a difference,"I was very disappointed by the soundtracks used on the discs. One of the things that made this a great series was how it related what was going on over there to our lives here through the same music. The soundtrack now sounds like someone sat down with a computer and created techno music that should have been used in another bad Karate Kid sequel.I love the series but hate what happened to the music - it was all a part of the story. Now, at times when there should be suspenseful music or something quiet you have these techno guitar riffs and peppy techno music. I will continue watching,but I hope some how the right music gets back on the discs."
2,Disappointing!,"I agree with some other fans of the series in that without the original soundtrack the dvd will be a disappointment. Certainly, the music isn't everything. But without the original soundtrack, the series will lose some of the 'feel' that the original series had. I know that I will be annoyed at the beginning of each show without the Stones cranking out ""Paint it Black."" I'll purchase the series when they get it right."
3,Where's the music???,"This was a great series, but I have to say that much of what made it so good was the music from the era. Why were the classic songs removed and the bland instrumentals added? I am very disappointed..."
2,"Wrong Music = No Sale, Sorry","Tour of Duty without the original music, especially 'Paint It Black'; I don't think so. It just wouldn't be the same. I am sure if I had never seen the originals it would be ok. For me though, even now years later I think first of Tour Of Duty each time I hear that song from the Stones. A series of DVD's costs enough for the producers to get it right if they want my money. I'd love to have Tour Of Duty & China Beach both complete series, but not without the music for them."
1,NOT the show you love,"This is a warning for all fans of the television classic 'Tour of Duty'. This DVD release DOES NOT contain the show you know and love. All music from the soundtrack has been removed, presumably for copyright reasons, and replaced by generic stock music, rendering the show almost unwatchable.I sent numerous email complaints to Sony Pictures Home Video customer service department, and got the following brush-off reply:Thank you for your recent inquiry!CTHE created all new music for this product as we were unable to obtain clearance to utilize the original music for the DVD.Thank you.Columbia Tristar Home EntertainmentConsumer RelationsI guess that shows how much they really value their customers. I encourage all fans to boycott this release and email complaints to Sony Pictures."
1,NO orginal music - a disgrace...,"Having pre-ordered this set, and being thrilled to hear it was coming out on DVD, I can't begin to describe the disgust I felt to realise as I watched and skipped ahead to my favourite bits - ALL the music from the original series has been lifted, and replaced with generic background music.An absolute disgrace - and I probably would not have bought it if I'd known all the music was gone (the amazon review wasn't available when pre-ordered). Paint it black - gone. Hendrix ""all along the watchtower"" at the end episode 10 with the pilot rescue - GONE. All of it. Disgraceful, and it shows how heavily the series benefited from the music of the generation. Shame Sony/Columbia/Tristar, Shame on you. This SUX. They've ruined my favorite show of all time."
1,Coverup,"I agree, at the time I write this there are only 5 other posts when there should be hundreds. I think Amazon got rid of them because they knew everyone was blasting it for not having the original music. It matters to many people, like me, and they won't buy it. I will continue to watch the original episodes on VHS with ALL the original music brcause it it PART OF THE STORY!"
2,"No music, no sense of the times!","I have been waiting for the release of this series. However, without the orginal music, the sense, the very essence, of the message - the turbulent times, the hopelessness, the shear insanity of it all can not be accurately portrayed. Therefore, unless or, until the orginal music is part of the series, I will not buy this set."
1,unfortunately a flawed set,"I wish I could buy this set, but due to the lack of it's original music score I won't. I don't want korny instrumental music inserted because the maker is too cheap to pay licensing fees. Tour of duty was one of my favorite shows years ago, I hope they correct this mistake and re-release it."
4,To all naggers about the original music,"Well, i was a bit scared after reading all those negative comments on the music, but i must confess that this feeling went away rather quickly. Ok, without the music, the feel is a bit different, however, i feel they've done a great job trying to recreate the music feel. The generic music imitates the original music (in for ex ep 2 or 3, where they should play Voodoo Chile Slight return from Jimi, they play a tune which closely resembles voodoo chile). The reason why you buy this, is for the series. And that rocks ! If you want music, buy one of the best of sixties CDs or so. Great show !"
3,Tour of Duty-Idiotic studio release,"What a shock it is when we see studio's doing these stupid moves like not putting in original soundtracks. Don't they know that the people who follow these shows do not mind paying extra for quality? The marketing manager for this release should be fired for such a dumb move. Hopefully they will re-release this with the original music back in, a FINE (second only to Combat!) series goofed up by a cheap move by the studio."
1,Bitter disappointment,"I made the mistake of buying Tour of Duty without researching or reading any reviews. I was in the dvd section of a retailer and saw it on the shelf. I watched every episode on tv and was really looking forward to watching it again. The omittance of the orginal music is a slap in the face to the true fan!! If they intend to release season 2 and 3, and do not have the music that was originally in the show I absolutely will not purchase the dvd's. I for one demand a re-release of season one with the original music!!"

3,If only...,"...the paper stock was a notch heavier. At 110 lb. instead of approximately 80 lb., it would be practically perfect."
2,Printing will drive you CRAZY!,"Unless you want to end up in an insane asylum, do not buy this paper. This paper doesn't work with Avery 8380 template, and is impossible to keep aligned in sheet-feeding printers. I have thrown out 1/2 the postcards I'm trying to print because they printed crooked!I have a good printer, too - a new Canon Pixma iP6700D. The cartridge won't accept these if you want to print landscape instead of portrait (doesn't accept 6 wide by 4 in. tall). Buy the 8.5 x 11 in. postcard sheets instead (2 postcards per sheet). Will be slightly more hassle to tear the postcards off the sheet, but at least they will print straight and you will have all your hair in the end!"
2,WHP150,Useable but barely adequate for an occasional use. Not good enough to delivery a really enjoyable listening to any 'serious' music lover.
5,Peaceful,"Relax, unwind, let the cares of the day slip away while listening to this outstanding production by Gary Stroutsos. The compositions will melt you from the very first notes of Gary's peaceful flute. Get this CD - treat your ears and your soul."
3,A little on the boring side,I ordered this cd because I live very close to Arch Cape where the artist of this album lives. I enjoy cuts one and two but the rest of the cd is very monotone. I listen to a lot of music in my studio as a massage therapist and this cd does not hold up well under repeated play. I suppose it would be nice to put on to go to sleep. The flute in it is quite beautifully palyed.
2,Deceptive information,"Even after using the does this fit my car information and being told it does fit my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500, it doesn't without a wiring adaptor from Reese part number 22281. The information on this item said just plug it in and it will work. This is not possible with the connector on the unit.Amazon needs to review the other controllers for missing or misleading information."
5,brake controler,"Recently I bought a brake controler from a sorce I won't disclose. The instalation digram was so vage I fryed the unit. I bought the Reese towpower unit which had the wire connector and directions. Installed and working less than 20 min, no joke."
5,FABULOUS,I love these bars. They're healthy (don't know how many WW points) and chewy and very satisfying and fun. I agree with everyone's thoughts. These are a total winner. Congrats to the Kashi people on a great product.
5,Excellent Quality & Taste !,Trail Mix Kashi Chewy Granola Bars are the best I ever tasted. They do not upset my stomach like other brands. Makes for a good healthy breakfast on the go or snack in between. I highly recommend you trying them out.
2,"thick, dense bars for energetic young people","I'm unimpressed with these. They are incredibly dense, so if you want to lose weight, avoid these. They do taste OK, but not great. I've had better tasting granola bars."
4,KILLING SOUND FROM PARIS,"AFTER HAVING FOLLOWED ""LA BRIGADE "" SINCE THE BEGINNING(black & white albums) I WAS VERY SURPRISED LISTENING THIS ONE WHICH IS THE BEST THEY HAVE NEVER DONE. YOU WILL FIND SOME GREAT FEATURING WITH JOEYSTARR(NTM), ARSENIK AS WELL AS SOUTH SOUND WITH SURIK'N ANS FAF LA RAGE. I RECOMEND YOU TO BUY THIS CD TO HAVE GOOD MOMENT OF MUSIC.DJ KA"
4,great compilation,"just a bit imcomplete. loved the inspector growing up & was thinking this was the complete set. only reason for 4 stars is that i know it is not - i have an old vhs recording with 1 episode called ""le cop on le rocks"" and it is not in this set. so if the set is missing one, how many more episodes are missing?outside of that it is a great compilation if you're a fan of the pink panther classics, ant & the aardvark, et al. would still recommend."
5,Bought for a gift.,Doing a little Christmas shopping in June for my grandchild. I know she'll love it because she loves the Pink Panther. I do all my shopping early. I'll be finished by August.
5,"Delightful,Delightful",I was so very pleased. It is the inspector and his assistant the way I remember them. The sounds and picture are excellent. I can't wait for the next series.
5,The Inspector Is Always On The Trail...,"Simply loved it and almost canceled the order. Glad I didnt and however, it says these are all of the episodes. Im afraid there is a minor mistake as I have some other episodes on tapes that arent shown here. In any case though, I would highly recommend anyone whose ever seen Inspector workit, getit, enjoyit. Thanks Amazon love my Inspector.."
4,Worth Every Penny,"This DVD is worth every penny I paid for it. Really, I'd pay twice that amount, considering how much enjoyment my children have gotten out of it. They watch it over and over, until I make them turn it off anyway. They giggle hysterically the whole time, and then walk around for the next few days acting out their favorite parts (thankfully not in a way anyone gets hurt) and quoting others. They've picked up on the ""say oui, not si"" joke and run with it. (7 year old asks 4 year old ""did you see that part in Star Wars where..."". 4 year old answers, ""say oui, not si"". Both fall over laughing.)I suppose it might annoy someone else, but I grew up watching ""The Inspector"", and it was one of favorite cartoons. It's not quite as hilarious to me now, or I would have given it 5 stars. But it's still a great show, that your kids will love."
4,bought this for the price,"I bough this for the price.Just to hear the remix versions.Ther'e OK.I like the original version better,still.Sometime the remixes are just as good,or better.Not in this case."
1,She's a fraud,"Watch the 48 hours episode about her ""forced"" bank robbery. She should have written a book about how to get away with robbing a bank-it would have sold much better. Plus, it would have some truth to it."
5,Boundaries in Marriage,"Drs. Henry Cloud and John Townsend have a gifted way in putting hard life issues in a good way by reminding us to take the power back that God has given us. They've written several books on boundaries that can apply to every relationship possible. In this book it describes healthy and safe ways to create boundaries in our personal lives that will enhance our marriages and give us absolute freedom to be ourselves. They don't say that boundaries are selfish hedges that we put around us like walls, but boundaries on ourselves that encourage healthy growing relationships. This is a must read for both husband and wife together if possible. This can be read by singles as well as just one half of the married couple, because gaining respect, responsibility, and freedom for ourselves is half the battle."
5,Boundaries in Marriage is a Must for every Marriage,"This book should be read by every couple that is thinking of getting married, is married or has been married. This book is eye opening, spiritually uplifting and supportive. Anyone that has had a difficult time correlating the bible to everyday life experiences (marriage for this book), needs to read this book. Boundaries in Marriage is an amazing tool. An absolute must read for anyone."
2,It did not help me.,"I had trouble understanding what the boundaries concept is and how to implement it. I have since read works by Eric Berne, William Glasser and Albert Ellis which were straightforward and very helpful."
1,Hard Read,"The authors of this book need to get out of the physco-babble and into an english class. While the concepts of the book are sound (and helpful), it is often difficult to get past their poor english to the points they are attempting to make. Be prepared to wade through the unnecessary words."
1,Elementary Information.,"I was very disappointed in this book, as most of the information in it seemed so obvious. I would recommend it only to people who have no knowledge whatsoever of how to relate to others."
3,Marriage relationship guide,"Book had many positive topics. If applied correctly, I believe that the topics discussed in this publication could work. Unfortunately for my marriage, it did not. I would still reccomment this work to a couple that would work to save thier marriage."
5,"This book could change your life... at the very least, save your sanity!","I cannot tell you what medicine this book has been for me. As one reviewer pointed out, it helps to be grounded Biblically when reading it (puts you in less danger of misapplying it). But this book is almost revolutionary in some Christian circles, where love and praying are synonymous with hoping and enabling. And it is a MUST READ FOR PASSIVE PEOPLE PARTNERED WITH DOMINANT SPOUSES. I haven't read the original Boundaries, so I am grateful that there is an edition that deals specifically with the marriage dynamics."
5,Boundaries in Marriage,This book and mentaility has saved my marriage. I share it with every friend of mine who is struggling. It gives women like me (who tend to be more quiet in the relationship) a voice. I am married to a very strong type A guy - and this book helped me learn how to deal with that without losing who I am and without compromising our marriage. It is an amazing book.
5,Help is on the way,This should be a prerequisite for all couples getting married. If I had read this and understood this concept things wouldn't have gotten so out of hand for the past 8 years. Things are back on track and now my husband is reading it.
4,Good advice,I would recommend this book to anyone getting married or already married. It gives good advice on how to handle issues that arise in a marriage.
3,KEITH FANS ONLY,"This album is only made for Keith fans, definitly not for new listeners. Definitly not Keith's best, but it's a good album. Lyrics are weak on most of the tracks and the production isn't mastered."
5,Sooooo H-O-T !!!!!,"I so enjoyed this collection of Super HOT stories! Though I liked all of them, my favorites are ""Double The Trouble"" and ""Oxford Blue"" oh and ""Sleeping Her Way To The Top"" was like WOW! Lexy Harper knows how to tell a ""bedtime story"" and I definitely plan to add more of her books to my tbr que."
2,Not what I expected,"I was dissapointed with this. A little less 'in your face"" raunch and a bit more erotica, please."
3,Does the job,"I ordered two sets of legs. They came seperately...not an issue but in both cases, the packing boxes were a mess. One set did not have all the necessary hardware and on one set, the leg foot is welded askew. Does not prevent me from using them however, but their quality control certainly needs significant improvement.Pete"
3,Good enough,"The legs are sturdy and everything lined up closely enough. The welds aren't perfect, and the feet are very slightly crooked, but both legs that I ordered are level. The surface is not finished very well (very rough), but that isn't a big concern for me. The boxes that they came in were torn to shreds, but no pieces were missing, and the legs suffered no visible damage.Overall, they are good enough for the price. They are height adjustable and they do a fine job of up holding my workbench."
2,slip shod chinese workmenship,"the top support is made up of two pieces of angle iron which are not level with each other at all. they do not use jigs, its obvious. the rest was okay"
3,Amazon Customer Service,"The 1st set of legs arrived via UPS with the box ripped to shreds and the legs bent. They are heavy steel so a great deal of force was required to bend the metal. I called Amazon and was stunned by their response. They overnighted a new set to my house. Again, the box was mangled, but the legs survived. Amazon sent me a return label for the bent legs. UPS fussed about the ripped box until I insisted that was the way they left it at my door. They wanted to charge me for a new box and for taping it up.I had to drill some new holes in the legs to get them to work in my design. Major drilling job with a heavy duty drill. Wore out a good bit with just 4 holes and I was oiling the bit often. Positioning and drilling the holes was a major workshop job.Once, modified, the legs worked very well.UPS gets a D, the legs get a C and Amazon gets a A++."
5,Great lesson in love and patience,"I have leant this book to 2 other ladies already. The first girl absolutely loved it and ordered it and I have yet to get it back from the second. She said it helped her with some of the issues she was having in her family. I thought the book was a real eye opener self review of our purposes and goals behind witnessing to others. It is a reminder of the importance of humility, trust, patience, prayer and above all love in every relationship."
3,Mountain Biking Texas 2003,"The book is a great guide to mountain biking in Texas...but it was written in 2003. That means the information is dated. For example Pace Bend -- park fees have changed, dogs are no longer allowed off-leash, and new, very difficult trails have been created. Get it. Read it. But view it as a jumping off point to get started on your mountain biking adventures. Definitely verify details before you head out."
4,Excellent.,"A killer set of tunes in her best album so far, mellow and tender in a country kind of way with the occasional blast of neil young like guitar.Just gets beter and better with every play."
4,"NICHOLAS RAY, OPUS 14","**** 1957. Directed by Nicholas Ray. After the failed bank heist of Northfield, Minn., Jesse and Frank James try to come back home. Flashbacks show us the important moments of Jesse's life. Even if the 20th Century Fox producers carved up the movie, Nicholas Ray's hand is still visible in numerous scenes of THE TRUE STORY OF JESSE JAMES: the hero's longing for a quiet anonymous life as he understands that his legend is a decoy, the gang's heists which are shot in a so anti-heroic manner that the film radiates a melancholic mood. The flashbacks, imposed by the producers and introduced by ridiculous floating clouds fortunately don't spoil the power of such a sublime scene as the murder of Jesse that the director patently delays as if he wanted to struggle with the Legend. Highly recommended."
4,The James boys ride again,"Essentially a remake of the film ""Jesse James"", this version has a fine cast. Robert Wagner and Jeffrey Hunter portray Jesse and Frank. In comparision, it is hard to fill the shoes of Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda, but the leads do well. Supporting cast Includes Hope Lang , Agnes Moorehead and Alan Hale. Look for John Carradine who was in the original. A good turn by Nicholas Ray make this a good bet to see."
4,Why not the correct aspect ratio?,"According to IMDB Technical Specifications, this film was shot at aspect ratio 2.35:1 which is widescreen - if IMDB is correct, why is 20th Century Fox Pan&Scanning; it into FULL SCREEN academy aspect ratio 1.33:1?Maybe the FULL SCREEN description is incorrect but I think I'll wait to see what other reviewers say before I purchase.I, too, am a Nicholas Ray fan."
4,Teaching Oral English,This edition is from the UK. I compared it with the copy I have from the library and found several changes in the table of contents. This edition is definitely more up-to-date as far as the TESOL methodology is concern. These revisions are very helpful for my research paper.
5,Beautiful and sturdy,This top was used as the bench top in my husbands workshop. You have to drill holes and bolt it onto the Shop Fox D2660 34-inch deep workbench legs. It is very easy to do. It's a great addition to his shop.
4,Well written and explained,"This guide is the definitive guide to advantage. No where else on the planet can you get the information detailed in this book.If you use advantage, you must have this book!"
1,Awful chemical smell,"This cat litter smells ok right out of the container, but as soon as my cat actually uses the litter, something about the combination of urine and whatever is in the litter produces an overpowering chemical smell that saturates the entire room. This smell is worse than plain cat urine (if that's possible) and I nearly threw up when I scooped the litter box. I immediately switched back to my other brand of cat litter, cat-attract."
5,Decades of Pleasure,"I first 'noticed' this perfume when I was a wee child; my godmother always wore it. Once I was an adult and able to enjoy some perfume, I contacted her (of course)and asked her what that was she wore all the time. From that day on I have worn this scent. Guerlain and Hobuigant are the best perfumes, in my humble option and the best way to wear a scent is to layer it, using the cream and the perfume. One other I enjoy is Louis Sherrer (the original) that Neiman Marcus debuted and I've never worn that or any of the Guerlain or Hobigant perfumes that I'm not asked about it."
5,Wonderful Lip smoother and sheer,"This is a great product. I live in Arizona so my lips are usually pretty dry and most lipsticks, sheers, glosses, etc. don't do much but dry them out even more. This product is very smooth, very moist without appearing that I just slathered on another layer of gloss. I liked it so much I bought two!"
5,Awesome!,"Used it for many different projects, wood and metal cutting. Works great. My latest job was cutting down an old satellite dish and it cut through the old bolts in seconds. Best birthday present ever!"
5,sawzall,"This was a gift for my son. I have owned and used, in my business, for over 40 years. Sawzall by Milwaukee is the top of the line in reciprcating saws."
2,homeowner special,"I was disappointed in the power of this saw. It's partially my mistake for not getting the ""Super Sawzall"", but I saw that this was 11 amp, which to me means it should pack a punch. My older Sawzall is 11 amp and it seems to have much more power than this one. Besides this one being weak, it has a really crappy stamped metal foot that I expect will be bent in a couple of weeks work. The cord is short, and not replacable.For the $40 difference between this and the ""Super"" Sawzall, which is 13amp and has the better adjustable foot and longer, replacable cord, I would recommend going with the more powerful one, even if you only use it once in a while. If you're using it regularly, this one isn't worth your time.Milwaukee shouldn't put their name on crap like this."
5,My son can thank me later when I'm too old to use this,"Tried Dewalt and Ryobi but neither had the feel of the Milwaukee. Also tried the hitachi, this one - I'm not proud to say- was over kill,(this one hard hitting model will throw a nasty jab).Decided to stick with Milwaukee and now I own this model.Pros - light weight, powerful, compact size, short stroke won't knock you over if the blade binds, quick change bit. Versatility (wood, pvc, copper tubing, tree limbs, nails, screws, bolts, wire, drywall, pumpkin carving for halloween, you get the picture).Cons - too light to use as a sledge hammer (should never do this but the thought does occur), the short stroke cuts slower, and it has a one piece cord. (Other models have the quick disconnect cord for ease of storage or replacement)If you are looking into purchasing a reciprocating saw I recommend this model because it packs a lot of usefulness at a reasonable price."
5,sawzall review,Product was everything it was advertised and works great. the delivery of the sawzall was fast and convient.
4,Great Tool,"I knew nothing about what my husband wanted in the way of a sawzall but what amp he wanted & that it was not to be battery operated. I found all the information I needed in the description of the tool & the picture you showed was exactly what i received in the mail! My husband was very happy with his birthday present, it has done everything he wanted. Thank you!"
4,First impressions,"For a c-note it is a good quality tool that I expect to last many many years. At this point, I only have one complaint and I believe it will cure itself with use.The quick-change coupler that holds the blades is EXTREMELY TIGHT. Inserting or removing blades is a chore. If the blades were a smidgin thinner, it would be pretty slick. I am using Milwaukee brand blades too so I can't blame it on ""cheap blades"". I think that with use it will loosen up but for now, it is very snug...yes I'm twisting the coupler, it is just tight. I don't regret the purchase, I believe it will loosen up with time. Plenty of power, nice case, good saw."
2,heavy,"the blades aren't strong enough but the swa itself is good, especialy for non carpentery projects. I end up buying another type of electric saw for capentery (this one is not for detailed work)"
4,Pleased w/ Saw,"Sawzall has plenty of power. Quickloc chuck makes it easy to intstall & remove blades.Tracks well for accurate cuts. Cut five 10' aluminum loading dock gates in half accurately, no binding w/ power to spare. Saw shipped minus the wood blade. Called Milwaukee & they shipped a blade within 3 days, in fact they even sent a spare. My next power tool will be a Milwaukee even if I have to pay a little more for it, in this case the saw was very reasonibly priced."
5,Great Saw for the Price,This is my first 'sawsall' but as per the reviews - it's a great saw. It's been used to cut metal and took down 15 year old vines like nothing. I would recommend this saw to others.
2,Not very usefull or comfortable.,"The leg lounger was not a usefull item and was more uncomfortable than anything. The inner air spring only works so so as well.In the end, we returned it."
2,Was too big,"This was a gift for someone, and really was way too big for what they wanted/needed - takes up way too much room in a bed."
4,More than just a history....,"Wynne tells the story of the men who served in the 15th Mississippi in their own words, couched in a profound explanation of the social and economic forces of the times. I was profoundly moved as I read of their homesickness, their loneliness, their fears, their exultation, and their intense connection to home, family, and community. This is a challenging and engaging read that I couldn't put down."
1,Lousy customer support,"Based on other on-line reviews I purchased an RS830 from Delta and received it on 10/21/2005 with a missing part (the work surface, or board as Delta calls it). It is now 12/07/2005 and I still have not received the missing part after 4 calls to the 800# for customer service and several e-mails to customer care (as they call it). I would like to use the saw some day instead of tripping over it in my workshop. It better be more reliable than their customer support which has gotten me to the point that I will probably never buy a Delta product again."
2,Never use it - wish I hadn't bought it!,"I bought this radial arm saw to use as a dedicated saw for dados. The pressboard table warps with every change of the weather, requiring frequently releveling. I generally just change blades and use the table saw instead. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,RS830 Delta Radial Arm Saw,"The saw arrived sooner than Amazon said it would, which was good. There was no damage to the box that it came in. The instructions that came with the saw were excellent. The saw required only one minor adjustment regarding getting the blade to the correct angle. The instructions walk you through the set-up. The first job I did was rip 1000 feet of barn board and it produced alot of saw dust. I think it's well made and should last a lifetime. I left it wired for 120 volts. If you can it wouldn't hurt to wire it for 220 as the motor draws alot of power on start up. I mounted it on two 2X6's that were glued with contruction cement to a 4X4 sheet of nice particle board. This way it's solid and could be moved. The blade that came with it is fine (carbide tipped), however count on picking up a fine cut blade for trim, etc. It appears that the $806.00 price is available no where else. I'm going to see how much Home Depot or Lowes sell it for, if it can be ordered through them."
1,AWFUL,"Product was so poorly packaged (delivered by Pilot) and subsequently damaged in transit, that it could not be assembled once delivered. Trying to schedule the return with Amazon and Pilot proved to be virtually impossible and the customer service we received was incredibly bad. I will think twice before ordering any large item from Amazon again, especially those made by Delta."
2,Mozart Requiem with a hefty dash of CH3COOH,"Recordings of the Mozart Requiem are legion. If a particular performance is to stand out nowadays, it needs a claim to fame. Such is the case here: Savall's performance is the most vinegary of them all.This is period practice with a vengeance: the strings are completely devoid of lustre. Savall must subscribe to the 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' School of string playing: it's exercrable. Alternatives such as Gardiner, Spering, Harnoncourt, Neumann, Norrington and many others are 'Karajan Soup' by comparison. As a consequence, the woodwind and timpany are to the fore, which makes for a very exciting performance . . . . . on a superficial level.The Masonic Funeral March is one of Mozart's most profound compositions but you would never know it if Savall was your sole reference. It's a steeplechase set to music: ""Oh, come with us and gallop, and gallop, and gallop.""Don't shortchange yourself by purchasing this CD like I wantonly did. Respect your ears !!!"
5,Wow...Spectacular album,"This album far exceeded my expectations. I bought this album for the sole reason that David and Diane Arkenstone had composed it, and therefore it was guaranteed that the music would be worthwhile. But I didn't expect this!! The music is incerdibly rich and fast-paced, filled to the brim with percussion. The first two songs of the album astounded me with their musical power. The ""Jungles of Ashimaaru"" however, (Song 6) might be the crowning achievement. The music builds in complexity as time goes on, and continues to do so until it quickly winds down when a mere minute of the song remains (the song is roughly 8 min). The song completely engaged me, physically and mentally. In fact, the whole album does. I'm sure you have heard the statement, ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" Well, the cover of this album is not particularly elaborate. In fact, if you are not familiar with these artists, you'd probably overlook it. But the music within is astonishing."
3,sneaker,"These sneakers are a medium - I have a long thin foot and often buy narrow sizes, but even the medium is a bit snug. I would prefer the shoe to be a little wider, but I am hoping it will stretch with wear."
4,Good Walking,These are excellent walking shoes. My only comment is that I would have preferred them as tie ups but that is personal preference.
5,Wonderful quality mattress,"We bought this for our 4 month old. She loves it, so we love it. Great quality and fast shipment. Great!"
4,Hallelujah - A Real Pinball Game,"The graphics are terrific! I also enjoy the fact that this game allows you to make so many choices for yourself. ANYONE can play this game because you can choose your own difficulty level. There are also some more subtle choices that you are allowed to make if you happen to fall into the category of pinball junky (like age and condition of the table). The video part of the game (the drill, the submarine, etc.) really add to the whole experience. Getting into the video adventures has been fairly difficult because I usually lose the ball as soon as I manage to get the video sequence started. I guess that I would have appreciated a detailed set of instructions before I started playing this game- which is the reason this game gets 4 stars instead of 5. But overall, a good game."
1,what's up with the color?,"My daughter got one Ugly doll a month ago and has been wanting more. Her favorite color is neon green so I thought this particular Ugly Doll would be a nice one to get for her birthday. But it just arrived the other day and it's a weird color. It sort of looks like cheap light orange fabric that is over the top of a gray-ish fabric, and you can see much of the gray through the ugly light orange color.It sure is....well, UGLY!But what is the color suppose to be? I am not sure if I got a weird, damaged one or something? It certainly does not look anything like the nice green color pictured here.Kids seem to enjoy this Ugly Doll series. I also got her a book on how to draw them and I noticed amazon has more books for them too. But I don't think my daughter is going to like this one very well. The color is just plain gross."
1,Very Disappointed,"Something has gone wrong with this shampoo. Although I realize that hair can change and thus the products used in the past may not work as well, this latest shipment that I received of the shampoo and the mouse were awful. The shampoo left my hair dry and flyaway and did not work at all as I would expect. The instructions on the back of the can for the mouse were not in English. I'll never ever order these again."
3,Kerastase Shampoo 2,"I purchased this shampoo because I've read about it and thought it would be great. I was not that impressed. The scent was nice and it was thick enough, but I still needed to use conditioner. I felt for the price I would get something much better. I will not spend my money on this product again."
4,pleased for the holidays,"after reading the reviews on the smg900 singing machine i was very worred .when it was delivered I tryed it and I though what i had read was true.No time to do any thing about it,I gave it to my daughter for Christmas.She is a professional singer. The sound that came out of it was fantastic. my daughter loves her smg900. Thank You"
2,Outdated technology---see Leadsinger microphone,"This system uses CD+G discs. This is a modification of the CD technology to add graphics, so words to a song can be shown on a TV. The problem is that CD's do not hold that much information. Early CD+G discs only had 4 songs. Newer ones hold up to 16 songs.Even at 16 songs per dics (at $20 per disc) you don't get many songs or much variety.Newer technologies are available that are much better. There are Karaoke machines that use DVD's, that are a better choice.But, I think the best system is the Leadsinger microphone that contains hundreds of songs in a single, portable microphone. And it is cheaper than this.The nice thing about this unit is the flexibility, the ability to record your singing and the ability to hook up other instruments to play along.But, who really needs all that?"
2,Sounds Great...But Didn't Work Properly,"Out of the box, this machine is impressive for the home user. Lots of great features and a good quality mic. The sound from this machine is great, clear, and you can turn it up loud. However, it took anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes to start playing a song. CDs were correct standard containing the compact disc symbol the instructions said was required. I tried cleaning it with a CD cleaning disk to no avail. I called the 800 number and after a 10 minute conversation they said to return it to where I purchased it as a defective unit because it does not properly recognize the CDs. Bought it on Amazon so I am returning it and they are paying the postage, which is wonderful considering how heavy it is. I am disappointed because I had great expectations...now I don't know what I'll buy to replace it. Considering other reviews of Singing Machine brand players with similar problems, I think I'll buy a different brand."
2,DONT BELIEVE THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION!,"Amazon's product description is wrong! This product DOES NOT include a wireless microphone. I was really excited to be getting a microphone without a cord for my three year old to trip over. I reported it to Amazon and they sent me another one exactly like the first one - NO WIRELESS MICROPHONE! I called in and they said too bad, the product description does not say it includes a wirelss microphone! See for yourself, it does. Then they said take the second one to the post office yourself to return it or we'll charge you!"
1,Displeased,"I returned the product because of its quality, the face of the cassette/tape doors were off. The only way they are connected to the machine is the use of double sided tape. The cd-changer is very prone to jam do to the slightest movement of the machine. The casters are very cheap. Also, I did not recieve what was advertised and had quite the problem returning it."
5,Quality product,"I have worn these briefs everyday for several years. They fit comfortably, the material is soft and it does help move moisture away from my skin. Best of all these briefs have proven to be exceptionally well made. I have not yet discarded a pair of briefs because of holes, tears, worn elastic, etc. The initial price is relatively high compared to what you'll find on the shelf at Stuff Marts, but the fit and feel is better and the long term value is fantastic."
5,Cute book!,This is a great book! I sang this song when I was in 4th grade (many years ago) and wanted to share it with my niece. Arrived quickly and in great shape!
1,BAD MACHINE,"I also purchased a GoVIDEO VCR/DVD Recorder Combo. Althought it was easy to set up and use, there was one day when I was totally unable to use the DVD player. When I called customer service and explained to the Rep what error message I was receiving, his explanation was simply, ""you have to replace it."" There was no further explanation of a known problem or an offer to replace my machine (which was under warranty). The offer to check-out and possibly repair the machine was much higher than the cost to replace it with another one. Hmmm."
3,In the House,"ISBN 0843101598 - Printed in Holland. Age range not stated. Board book, 6 pages. Published by Price/Stern/Sloan Publishers Inc in 1981. No author or illustrator named on the book.There are no words in this book. Each page features one household item on a solid, bright background. Household items include a chair, a table, a cuckoo clock, a window, a cabinet and a potted flower.Not a book I'd spend a fortune on, considering how small it is, but it's still an educational tool that very young pre-readers will enjoy. This isn't about reading, but is about language and the lack of words makes this the most multi-lingual book ever because a parent will teach the words for the items on the pages in their own language.- AnnaLovesBooks"
2,Dissapointed,We ordered this plane after getting the Orville Wright Bros. plane because the Orvile plane was lazer cut and perfect and a joy to build. The pieces were easy to remove with no breakage and the many hours that were spent on it were quite enjoyable. This plane now came and we were very disappointed with the way it was presented. Parts were lazer cut others were not. For the price we felt it is totally not worth the money.Very difficult with inferior materials and sketchy instructions to boot. Even had to soak some of the parts in water in order to bend them around in places.
3,I Tried to like this book....,"....but the problem is with the translation. Eugene Jolas' translation is horribly outdated, was in fact done in the early thirties. Nobody has even thought about re-translating what seems to me, in spite of the outdated, insipid colloqualisms, quite a very good, fascinating book. This is why I gave the book three rather than one or two."
4,Excellent music,"When I listen to this music,I have much brave in my mind. I feel that this music fitting for summner morning.Thanks, Shigefumi Mori"
3,Review of Huffy So Sweet Bike,"This bike is basically OK, but I pity anyone who might try to assemble it without the proper tools.All nuts and bolts are metric. The tires were deflated. Worst I found was that the width of the front forks and the the width of the axle mounting points did not match. I had to spread the forks apart with brute force to get them to go around the inner nuts on the axle. The forks brackets were half a bolt too narrow. I could either leave the nuts on and spread the forks or remove the nuts and really have to tighten the forks together about 1/4"". Print and diagrams on the instruction sheet were so small, they were basically useless. Had to use a magnifying glass.I had all of the tools and a compressor, so aside from the front forks, assembly was not a problem.Grandaughter is enjoying the bike. Only problem so far has been handlebars that are slightly loose. I have tightened them down. Hopefully, that will be enough."
5,nice quality bike for the price,"I purchased this bike for my daughter's 7th birthday...of course, my husband isn't very sneaky and she discovered it and fell in love with it! This is the 1st bike, other than used, that we have purchased. It is nice and sturdy and very easy put together and for the great price. Hopefully she enjoys it for the next 4 years or so."
5,BRUCE BLITZ CARTOONING,"Absolutely the most ""checked-out"" book in our 6TH GRADE art-class library.I have two copies, and will buy more.Kids can't get enough of this book!!!!!"
5,Amazing book!!,Its an amazing book and you can learning all the basics thing about cartoon started with faces and ending with a pro cartooning.Big Book of Cartooning
3,It's ok,"I love drawing cartoons. This book is not to bad. It is just a little too simple. I prefer a bit harder of a challenge when I draw. However for the less experienced cartoonists, I would reccomend it to them.. Good quality though. Thank you."
2,Games Only - No Tutorials,This CD-Rom has no tutorials. The game-like format is frenetic in audio and in visuals. Wrong answers are not corrected. My young teen was very disappointed.
1,Waste of money,"The Boppy Prop Up Play Pad is a horrible investment. I have a 3 month old daughter & decided to invest in this toy to make tummy time more appealing to her. She doesn't like to be on her stomach, but for developmental & health reasons, I know it's important. So I shelled out the $24.99 plus tax and feel gypped. You would get the same benefits by putting the baby in the middle of a travel neck pillow on top of a quilted pillow sham and using some of the rattles & teethers most babies have too many of already.I even bought the blue instead of pink version so if I have another child & it's a boy, I won't feel like I'm turning my boy into a sissy. I'm hoping I can return this darn thing."
2,Leave Your Religion Out!,Automatically I questioned the validity of what I was about to read when the author infused the Book of Mormon with the origin of Native Americans. Am I to believe that the spirituality of Native Americans is based on Mormonism? Either way I don't want to hear an author's biased account on something meant to be scientific/anthropologic. There are better books on the subject by more credibile authors. Don't pick up this Mormon book with a Native American cover.
3,Dr. Heinerman unable to get past his LDS belief.,"Dr. Heinerman allowed his LDS (Mormon) faith to influence his perceptions of Native American Spirituality.On pages 118 and 119 Dr. Heinerman implies that indians worshiped nature.Native people did NOT worship nature! They worshiped the Creator (The Great Spirit), and treated nature with reverence and respect.How can one worship the Creator then disrespect creation? I make these statements from my perceptions of following the red road.Dr. Heinerman; jumps around between many different American Indian Nations (Aztec, Blackfoot, Cherokee, Crow, Hopi, Mayan, Sioux, and others) without covering any of them in enough depth to assist one in their studies.Please see my listmania lists for the best books (in my opinion) in assorted categories including Native American SpiritualityI encourage E-Mails from people with comments and questions.

4,I own it & like it,I purchsed this lathe at woodcraft store in Newigton NH for $710 during a 10% off sale . It's been a good machine for small to medium work. I wouldn't recommend it for big work. ( turned a 15lb. burl on it but never again) As for the value for money--> I don't think that there is another lathe on the market that would come close. Jet did a great job for a small price.
5,Great product,"I spent alot of time checking out which lathe I wanted to buy in this size. Most of my woodworking stationary tools are Delta but I didn't feel that they made a comparable unit in this category. After having this for a couple of years now I can still say this is absolutely a great purchase. Speed changes are effortless; heavy construction virtually eliminates vibration (even when I decide to turn large out of balance blocks). Easy set up, easy to use and high quality add up to a best buy."
2,Don't waste your money,"Every year I make my daughter's costume, but this year she saw the Hobbit costume and wanted to wear it for Halloween. She is a very big LOTR fan. When I finally agreed she was very excited. However, she was horribly disappointed when it arrived. It was very cheaply made. The 'vest' was basically an apron and the cloak was a very thin polyester. I had to, in the end, make her Hobbit costume. She said after this, she'll never buy a store bought costume"
4,Hobbit Costume,"I needed a quick fix for a costume for my son. We were going to a convention and he needed to dress up like a Lord of the Rings character. I was a little disappointed when I first received it. The picture showed pants and a shirt which it didn't come with. I didn't read into the description enough. Luckily I had a shirt and pants. The price seemed a bit high. Well, some clear strapped flip flops and some hair on the feet and he was an adorable hobbit! He even won the children's costume contest at the convention and was presented a prize by Bruce Hopkins (Gamling from the LotR movies). The costume held up under my son's rough handling. My only complaint would be the satchel strap. What were they thinking? It's WAY too long."
1,Poor manufacturing,"While I thank the merchant for getting my order to me so quickly, I'm disappointed with the mold because the blades of the sissors were pressed incorrectly by the manufacturer. They should be concave to hold chocolate and they are the opposite so they will only be outlined. I'm sure I can figure out a way to use the mold. It was so inexpensive it wouldn't be worth returning."
2,funny looking image,"The image looks funny from the mirror. I did not find out it until I put it on my car. Took me a while to get it done, so I might leave it."
1,My biggest CD-purchase mistake this year,"I heard the group Thirteenth Blackbird on the radio, and liked them very much. But I was very disappointed by their CD, ""Round Nut Tool"". The musicianship is excellent, but almost all the selections are seemingly endless repetitions of discordant and arhythmic sounds, rendering the music unlistenable. Music is melody, harmony, rhythm--yes?--all of which are virtually absent here.The ensemble's most dynamic work, I think, is 13 compositions around the Stevens poem ""thirteen ways of looking at a blackbird"". Only three of the 13 pieces are included here, and only one of these is anything like what I think of as music. So I spent fifteen dollars on a CD I could barely listen to once--waste of money."
3,surprisingly fun,"Well, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this film. As a previous reviewer said, don't expect any budget whatsoever here. The film starts off with a surefire way to engage an audience- separate a mother from her young daughter who she's on the outs with. For the most part it is a foolproof scenario. Having the kid played by an actual kid works in this, too. Throw in a townwide conspiracy, a Los Angeles County sheriff's uniform on a sherriff in Texas, which adds to the film's tension, because you feel like you know the mom sees it and she doesn't say anything about it. However, the fake mullet wig is real bad on the son, but I'll even forgive that by just presuming the character may have cut it himself. So if you're into cheesy movies on a zero budget, just drop kick your disbelief and go in with a forgiving atitude and you may be okay with this movie. The film has a lot more sincerity than budget and for that I'll go along with it."
1,Some Low Budget Movies are Good but THIS ONE IS NOT,They deserve 1 star just for having the courage to put out this movie. The filming is horrible and the sound worst! I will not comment of the actors because they are just working.
4,"Lovely, lush healing music","Well, I would rate this CD five stars, but the music is a litle ""full"" for my taste in spots. The CD is very compelling, not overly sweet and/or cloying, and there is a wonderful musical quality to each piece. I was quite surprised by the consistency of the CD, with strong offerings on each track; often this type of music begins to sound repetitious after a bit... The music contains a lot of electronic voicings and embellishments, and it provides a truly meticulous sound environment. The healing quality of the music is evident throughout. My favorite track is number 5, ""Transformation"". The music on this CD has been very well-received when played on Nightlight, a public radio program in Alaska."
5,The Healing Spirit,"This CD was purchased for a gift for a friend who is in need of the ""healing spirit"". I already have enjoyed this album with it's soothing music for several years, and thought this would help our friend as she goes through treatment for breast cancer with surgery and chemotherapy. It's lush orchestration and beautiful melodies will help her heal and lift her spirits.Thank you Diane Arkenstone for your ""healing"" creativity!Dr. Christopher Hermann"
3,grinder,grinder needs a more solid tool rest on the front. the plastic cover is a bit wobbly to support a good tool rest. a good grinder for the money.
4,Delta GR050 Utility Wet/Dry Grinder,"Compact wet/dry grinder for use as pre-grind on small knives, craving or turning tools. Very good value as price is low and results are excellent for the type of stone available. Does not replace the need for a lapping or stroping system to obtain sharpest edges."
1,Haven't gotten it yet,"I ordered the magazine over a month ago and have not received it yet. I know it might take a couple more weeks, but that is where I am at right now."
1,Bad copy of movie,"I really wanted this movie. I saw part of it on HBO or Starz. So I ordered it from Amazon. The transfer dub from the factory was garbled. There was a flaw in the whole movie. The images would not stay still. Just the video transfer was flawed. Amazon sent me a replacement. The same happened again. I asked for them to call the manufacture to do a make good on my purchase. To find me a decent dub of the movie.Yes, Amazon refunded my money. But do you think the customer service department would even listen to me. I wanted to buy this movie. So why can't a manager from Amazon, call the distributor of the movie. Tell them the problem and I try to get me this movie.I rate the movie as good. Amazon's customer service as very poor. Even trying to hear me out to make good my purchase. Yes, the refund is fine. But they could have tried harder to call the manufacture and make good my purchase."
3,Slower movie,This movie is a tad slow and predictable. You wish more romantic things would happen. It starts out like it could be good but then slowly fades away.
3,Lame Movie,I give this movie 3 stars only because the shipping was great. Otherwise I would have given it 1 star. It was terrible! I've already given it to good will. The story was choppy and the acting so so at best. It really was bad.
4,Best of Debbie,I enjoyed this book very much. I would like to read more about the characters in this book. I really enjoy reading Debbie Macomber's books. I think I have enjoyed most all of her books.
3,why 2 stories in one book?,Very good story but don't like how it's broken into 2 stories in one book
4,Good Sleeping Bag,"I bought this as a present for my daughter who is 11. She loves the flannel lining and before she even used it as a sleeping bag, she opened it up and used it as a bedspread. It is great as an indoor bag---although not sure how it would be outside in the cold. The only problem we found was rolling it up and getting it in the bag provided. It was rather hard for her to roll and difficult to get into the bag. Otherwise--very soft and comfortable."
4,Good Tool,"I like this tool a lot. It sands well and is built sturdy. Of course anything that carries the MAKITA name has a place in my shed. But aside from that I found that is had good power and that it will do the job. Recommend you were a mask when sanding too, so your lungs don't fill up with dust. The dust bag is quite handy and the case keeps is safe. With the right pads you will be able to sand anything.I recommend this tool. Hands down."
4,"Eclectic, stimulating and thought-provoking","The Mutton Birds have produced a fascinating collection of songstories here: much to enjoy on every level. Very accessible guitar-driven melodic rock in the general school of Crowded House (but in no way imitating them), strong hooks and intruiging storylines. Initial impressions of an easy-going, lightweight sound give way to hints of deeper and darker perspectives...witness the strangely unsettling ""White Valiant"" and the frankly scary ""Thing Well Made"". Almost all the tracks here are instantly likeable and reveal further rewards with repeated listening. A real gem of an album."
5,Delightful,"This is one of those CDs that I'd take with me if I knew I'd be stranded on a desert island with a CD player and a solar panel to power it with. Beautiful. Kings Noyse recorded many of the same selections, but I like Jordi's best."
4,fast synth pop,"Ok, so English is not their native language, but that's what we love about northern european bands, isn't it? Meanwhile, the music, pure techno dance, has a light airy feel to it, very reminiscent of say Erasure. The rhytm tracks are fast but never furious, the synths never try to be anything else than what they are and have been since the guys of OMD touched one, the songs have actual lyrics, and it's all heavily influenced by trance.Don't buy this album if you need to listen to a stellar singing voice. Buy it to listen to techno dance candy that's a cut above the Capella / Haddaway producer-junk."
2,Schenanigans!,"You know damn well the only thing anybody wants from this recording is the Dameron/Golson interview! I wish Amazon/iTunes would stop the ""Album Only"" nonsense! Give the people what they want. The interview should have been a bonus track on ""Mad About Tadd"", a classic album, by Continuum( now available on CD...on Amazon!) Continuum is Jimmy Heath-tenor, Slide Hampton-trombone, Kenny Barron-piano, Ron Carter-bass, Art Taylor-drums. I bought it on vinyl a long time ago,and for any student of bebop,modern jazz,whatever, it's a MUST HAVE!! I had to buy an album of dead, bloodless renditions of classic tunes just for the one track I wanted. I thought the days of buying a crap album for one good track were supposed to be over by now! The interview is great,but I couldn't make it through the first few tunes. Hope you theives enjoyed my eight bucks. Several of my friends are enjoying the interview!"
5,If you want to actually ask God and get an answer - follow this book !,"A group of us decided to follow the guidance in this wonderful book, about how to contact God, via the holy spirits, and what this book teaches is true. Weekly we hold prayer seances, or prayer meetings, with the style taught in this book, and we have each been given tremendous insight, from prophetic, or mediumistic gifts, messages, many healings, help in knowledge for others. It doesn't get any better than this. Because of the holy spirits of God who have taught us so much, we are eternally grateful for this book which proved that God does indeed still give to His children all that they ask, if they know the means of communication - and this book has the answer."
1,"Too many errors and ommissions for an ""encyclopedia""","It's hard to believe that so many words could be published on this subject under the guise of an ""encylopedia"" - yet omit facts and historical data that are essential to the story.Accuracy and thoroughness is essential when writing about the Holocaust - or any historical event. Otherwise the writing because fodder for those that deny it ever happened.I would not rely on this for research. But, it's not bad reading - if you keep that in mind."
1,Flawed Final Judgment,"Henry Clausen, now exposed by new research, will be remembered as another ""company man"" who tried to cover-up, and in some cases, shut-up, some of the principals involved in the scandal and protect the careers of Marshall and Stark.He picked up where Rear Admiral Leigh Noyes started. Noyes, the Navy's Director of Communications, was the individual responsible for instituting a 54 year censorship policy that consigned all radio intercepts and memoranda to the Navy vaults...and he did this on December 11, 1941. Then, he put out the directive, ""Destroy all notes and anything in writing.""The clean-up continued with Henry Clausen contacting every key witness and coercing and threatening them to change their testimony.An interesting book...but a fatally flawed judgment, and definitely not final by any means."
3,"A fabulous story, but not well edited",I found Clive's history about as breathtaking as is possible to believe. Unforunately Harvey is under-served by his editor who allowed entirely too much reiteraton and recapulation so the the writing lacks continuity and drama that should have set it on fire.
2,"Nice package, little book","If you are looking for a quick visual reminder of the handful of Marc Newson designs in this book (plus a t-shirt and buttons -- wow!), then perhaps this is for you. The title should have given it away, but it didn't ... it's an 18-page pop-up book.I was hoping for a few pages about each project, the thought processes behind the design and materials choices, more cool pictures of the plane and the plane-like chaise, but none of those are in here. There's a one-paragraph word-bite about each project, and then a picture (or pictures (1 project)) that moves, or pops up in 3-D. Very limited, and rather disappointing. Yes, they look cool -- I just wanted more.It also comes with '1 SHEET OF BLOTTER-ART'. If it were actual blotter, then I'm sure the book would be that much more interesting.So, to reiterate: if you love his work, and more is better, then this may be for you. If you want to learn, however, your money is better spent elsewhere."
2,only for fans,"contrived and novelty- for true fans only. cute but no info, more like a kids book. who cares about the ""extra"" stuff when it feels a bit fluffy anyway."
4,"Man, does any one know what im talking about?","I am a fan of the love parade, and im am shocked at how many people you can talk to and not one will tell you what the love parade is. I live in California and I constantly ask friends at school i f the know what in talking about, and they just give me a blank stare. I showed them the CD and they were very exited about the way that the Germans played their techno music. I've been to the LOVE PARADE in Mexico City, and let me tell you the music that they play and the Concert ist self is like nothing ive heard in my life. I recomend the CD, it will get you moving."
4,BEAUTIFUL AND THICK!,"This tabletop is beautiful! The only negative is ours came with a notch, it was obviously hit at some point, so the gash is a little bit of an eyesore on the top surface. We decided not to contact the company to return it because it was a father's day gift that arrived just in time, it's just always a disappointment to get a damaged product."
4,Not sure yet,"We haven't had a chance to objectively rate these yet. They look nice, but since we haven't used them, we aren't too sure how durable they will be for our little cowboy."
4,Fun spurs,My 9 year old daughter wore the spurs all day and evening on Halloween.They added a very authentic element to her cow girl costume.She especially loved the realistic jangling noise they made with each step.
4,Pleased with the DVR,"Everything works as advertised. I am getting excellent high definition recordings with full Dolby Digital 5.1 sound when broadcast. I am using the recorder with a roof antenna only - no cable, and using the HDMI output. It receives all of the L.A. digital channels (about 40 of them) and all seven of the ones broadcasting in high definition. The user interface and programming of recordings is not as simple as a TiVo, but the program data is free. The data and programming has also survived several two hour power outages. The recorder worked fine out of the box, but there are lots of menus for the geeks (like me) to play with. The 500 Gigs of storage are more than adequate for my needs. All in all, I am very happy with this purchase."
2,Good when it works.,"I use this unit in a Comcast Cablecard setup. I like everything about the system but for its lack of reliability. The quality of recording is high, the capacity is excellent, the ease of use is fine. I have no problem with the system of menus or the TVG. For no reason I can discover, the system fails to perform about one out of ten scheduled recordings. I can discern no pattern. It will record a given show on a given channel at a given time correctly upon one occasion but not on another. When I observe such a failure, and attempt to record the program manually, the machine will not accept the 'record' command. Maybe it's the machine. Maybe it's the Cablecard. I cannot recommend the device."
2,Do your research before you buy....,"I made the mistake of buying this unit to soon without doing my home work.1. The TV Guide On Screen is limited to 3 digit numbers ( 999 max ) which is just stupid given the fact that some free ( atleast in my area ) HD broadcasts use 4 digit numbers. So in CHANNEL EDITOR, I can't replace a SD channel number with a HD channel because the tune channel field won't accept a 4 digit number. What a stupid limitation!2. Recording on this device has it's limitations! Download the manual and do a comparison with other DVRs.I give this unit 2 stars because it supports HD recording and has tons of storage space. All the other features falls short of my expectations."
5,Impressive technology and simple to use,I am very happy with this Sony DVR. The HD recording is very easy and the playback is perfect. Capacity (at least with the 500) is not a problem either. I would definitely recommend this product.
2,SONY HD DVR vs. TIVO HD series 3,"Well I had the SONY DVR but the software was pure junk. The TIVO user interface & capabilities are far superior, we would rather pay the monthly fee & get something highly usable than use the no fee SONY. I am a big SONY fan but this time I found out they cannot compete. On the SONY you cannot put in a keyword & have it record any show that contains that keyword, called WISH LIST in TIVO. If you record a repeating show week to week you cannot tell it to only save the last so many shows. TIVO has all of this & then some. The Internet connection makes upgrades easy for TIVO, no can do with SONY. So with TIVO it's either the old fashion fone line connection or an Internet connection."
2,Can't Recommend,"I wanted to really like this DVR. I really did. But after spending a week trying to get the TV Guide listings to ever populate (never did), and dealing with very poor Sony support, I gave up and returned it to the store. I could overlook the single tuner, but without the Guide, the DVR is useless. I was trying to use this with Comcast Cable with a Cable Card...and the TV Guide never populated. From reading user forums, the TV Guide appears to be the very weak point of the unit. I'm extremely disappointed that Sony put their name on this $1000 boat anchor. I'm sorry, but from my experience, I can't recommend this unit to anyone"
1,Sony DVR,"I had the DVR and it broke in less that one year.There was a warranty, but sony refused to honor it.Save yourself some grief, do not buy this lemon of a product"
2,What's the Opposite of Stealth?,"Umm yeah, unless you're used to carrying around a massive photo kit, I'll bet this will not seem like a small bag to you. Like other reviews have stated, it's so darn blocky, like a cooler, I can't imagine using it when I travel. It almost seems like this is really just designed to transport equipment (like on a plane and then into a hotel) but not necessarily to use in the field. Maybe it's me, but I was basically expecting a holster type bag with a little extra room for a flash, filter and other accessories. This is not that bag."
5,Best if read in the Third Person!!,"Gregory has transformed a simple Gyro in to a mouth watering look at the Microcosom of the ""True Greek Art"" Of cooking. This book breaks down mere Mussaka into ingredients and simple directions so you can cook it yourself. No more do we have to depend on Greek diners to treat us to the culunary creations of the Greek Isles, we can do it at home for ourselves.Somebody needs to give this guy an award for his simple cookbook. Read it, Love It, and Go Greek!Note: No Windex was used in the creation of this review. But I should have."
3,Its OK but basically a simple costume,"Its an OK costume but the the lightning bolts on the mask flop down we had to fix it with pins and don't expect too much from it. Its a halloween costume that lasted about as long as the holiday, 1 day. Overall my son enjoyed it"
5,"Viva, Allende","The only Allende book I couldn't finish was El Plan Infinito. All the rest have been superb. La Casa de los Espiritus was the first novel I ever read in Spanish, once I got into the rhythm of her writing it was like reading a beautiful song. La Ciudad de las Bestias is no different, and I'm delighted that she's writing books for young people. Like the Harry Potter series, I suspect these books will be every bit as popular with her adult readers.Allende's ability and willingness to weave social themes into her books is to be applauded. All of us, no matter our age, need to be reminded that we have problems on this planet, and that we are the only ones who can solve them. We welcome her to the steadily growing group of human beings who are working to save this planet instead of destroy it. In light and joy, Nancy D."
4,Teaching from Ciudad de las Bestias,"Honestly, I was reluctant to try to read this novel instead of using all the wonderful materials I have collected through the years. I am attempting it at the strong suggestion of the University in High School program I work with. I have been pleased with the repetition of useful vocabulary, the introduction to common expressions previously untaught, the coverage of the conservation issues concerning the Amazon, the culture of the indigenous people, the development of the characters, and, oh, all right, the Magical Realism. I am using it in a Spanish V class. They agreed to continue the novel when I gave them the option. If permission can be granted to view an R rated movie, The Emerald Forest seems to be a good companion. For me there has been an incredible amount of preparation in order to present this as a class activity."
4,"charming, funny, and surprising","At first the book was a little boring to read. But then I really got into it. It was funny, interesting, and shocking at the end. It's a good read, and I would recomend it."
2,Lack of Imagination?,"After reading ""Retrato en Sepia"" & ""La Hija de la Fortuna"" I was expecting another excellent book; unfortunately it seems that Doña Isabel already ran out of good material or was in a hurry to publish something new. DO not waist you time and money as I did..."
4,Super Nova,I bought the Makita 4341 FCT because of the reviews listed here.My old Jig saw was 40 year old B&D.I was looking at a Milwalke but concerns where expressed with the blade changing.The Makita blade change is fast and easy taking less than a 3 seconds.Using the Bosch blades I was impressed with the power of the saw cutting through 1 1/2 of plywood.Vibration seemed to be quite low.The on/off button would be better as a toggle switch but this is a minor point. I'am glad I bought the barrel type as I can see you have more control plus enables you to get in to tight spots.The LED light works but could be even brighter for my tried eyes it certainly better than nothing at all.The soft start is a bonus plus.The Makita case is notlike the old metal ones this a plastc effort hardly gives enough room for the cord and a couple blades packages.I say drop the price and forget the case minor point though.All in all I am happy with the Makita 4341FCT Barrel Grip.
5,H. Macias - Finish Carpenter,"I used to own a porter cable jigsaw. After I read a tool test in one of my wood magazines, I sold my PC and bought me the Makita. One of the best decisions I've ever made. I should have bought this one the first time. It is just a great power tool. I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to anybody that is thinking of buying a jigsaw. It is powerfull, handles awesome and it is very quiet."
2,"Too many factual errors, EASY ONES, too bad.","OK, Chuck Yeager didn't break the sound barrier in the X-15. It was the X-1. They made a movie about it called ""The Right Stuff.""After reading ""For All Mankind"" a couple of times right after Chaikin's ""A Man on the Moon"" and Murray's ""Apollo"", I'm really disappointed by the number of obvious errors. Some have already been pointed out above (including a couple that I missed in casual readings). This isn't like a Star Trek convention -- some of these things are blatant and easily corrected. And we're talking about common things that anyone can look up in an encyclopedia.I actually like the style of the book, and the perspective from which he writes. I'm just not sure I can trust the facts in it when I know so many of them to be wrong. I believe though that all space fans that know the difference need to read this book, just to make sure they'll appreciate the others."
3,"Had lots of flaws, but decent content","Although there were obvious factual, technical, and mechanicalerrors... I liked how it looked into the minds and lives of theastronauts... that part was accurate and well-researched. One examle of an obvious error was when Hurt was quoting the plaque that Apollo 11 placed on the moon, he said ""July 1960."""
1,No reason to read this book,"Terrible, terrible disregard for facts, understanding, and accuracy. There are far better and more interesting histories."
2,The author changes history by using bad facts.,"Although Mr. Hurt does a satisfactory job of presenting the development of the Apollo program via interlocking it with the progress of a flight, his presentation of the technical facts and historical facts are not realistic. I fear that people that read his book will not receive the proper facts about the Apollo program.Some of his ideas aren't even realistic. For example, he always calls the far side of the moon the ""dark side"" although it spends the same amount of time in darkness as the near side! He even has the astronauts HANGING from their boots in the spacecraft, rather than lying on their backs!!His overall presentation method is interesting, or else I would have rated this as a ""1"""
5,The definitive book on the Apollo project.,"This is a very unique work of non-fiction in which the author was able to carry the reader on the ride with the astronauts themselves. It gives us the exhilirating feeling as if we were the fourth man on that Apollo mission. It utilizes the knowledge we know from interviews with the heroes involved with the moon race and the technical information of the spacecraft used and it blends into a ride far more exciting that any other adventure. We share the excitement of liftoff, the suspense of the landing, and the final hurl of reentry that only the astronauts could have experienced"
4,Alt country. Rock-n-roll,"I am not sure just where Tom Gillam fits into todays music. He is very good. A little southern rock, a little alt country, a little rock-n-roll. You can not go wrong with this cd."
5,Best we've tried so far!,"These are the best pull-ups we've tried so far. I'm pretty impressed. They're a bit softer than the others we've tried (and we've tried pretty near all of them out there!). They are very absorbent, and hold a lot more than other brands. We will be repeat customers."
1,Oops! Made a mistake,"I meant to purchase XL briefs, rather than underwear. These are good quality, but not of much use to me as Mom needs adjustable briefs for ease in putting on and off."
4,"Nice dryer, comb bends easily though.","Love the dryer! Saves me time and my hair feels healthy after drying. It works well and the comb attachment is not the hard, scratchy plastic. Much gentler on the scalp. The downside is a couple of the teeth of the comb have already bent, thus the 4 star rating. It still works well though."
5,Lightweight and Just amazing,"Hair dryer is lightweight and simply phenomenal.It dried my relaxed, afro textured hair in 10 minutes flat on the lowest possible setting! (low heat, low airflow)"
1,Maybe I received a bad dryer but this did NOT work,"I did my research on a series of hair dryers prior to purchasing this. I read the reviews here and they were very positive. As a prime members I always do my best to take advantage of the items that allow free shipping so it was great that this fit the ticket. Unfortunately, this dryer died after the first usage. I turned it on to see if it would work properly and it did...the first time. I tried to use it a day or so later and it wouldn't even come on. Very disappointed! Thankfully amazon has great customer service and will be giving me a refund. However, I really wanted this product to work, now I'm looking for yet another dryer."
5,Love the dryer but...,Absolutely hated the comb! I need a comb that can stand up to my hair and this one could not. The dryer is fantastic! It has a setting for any type of hair and it dries quickly!
5,Great Dryer!,"Love the dryer, gets HOT which my thick, porous hair needs. Comb attachment runs easily through my hair...only minus is the comb attachment is starting to bend, but again, my hair is past my shoulders, and super thick! Thanks Gold N HoT!"
1,The title's the best bit,"I've tried, believe me I've tried, but this is samey and slackerish, like that depressive American poet with the short Chinese name that's like the other one with the short Chinese name (I thought the Chinese used to take Western names to forestall this eventuality?), and the pieces are all the same length and the killer is THERE'S NO PAGINATION so you can't tell how you're doing. Not well, though - but I won't give up on Joe. Mine's the 5th impression so.. maybe there's some inscrutable ironic intent??"
1,"Yes, But NO","Well it IS a great conceit for a book, but it goes on for much too long and ultimately just turns into mush, spirals deeper and deeper into itself, and loses the reader entirely--and not because it's particularly profound, but instead because it's simply not up to its own challenges as a project. So good idea, but hardly worth it. The excerpts online already are enough to get a sense of the book."
1,NO BIGGIE,"This cheesily produced nonbook proves again that few poets these days are up to the challenge of writing prose. There's a lot of posturing and facile attitudinizing, and some strained writing-workshop stunts, and lots of facile portentousness. It's a one-joke book, and the joke falls flat pretty fast."
2,"Shocking, Just Shocking","What surprises me is the amount of attention this book has received. It's simply not any good. There is no narrative whatsoever in it, the ""pieces"" simply line up with one liner after one liner. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about the book is the glowing review it received from poet John D'Agata in a magazine recently. He's an otherwise very smart guy, so I don't know what's up with that. I just don't think this book is worth this hoopla. If you've been recommended this bok I suggest you try first Wenderoth's first book, which is a true biggie or artistic brilliance. This ones just clever."
3,little wendy,"Well, okay, it's great to suddenly hear Wenderoth lust after an American Icon/logo (and she gets spanked!). ""Letters"" is interesting in parts, but by page 150 one starts to feel a sense of diminishing returns while reading this book. How many clever--albeit slightly twisted--aphorisms in a row can one continue to be as hungry for, after all, as, say one of those big double cheeseburgers with the dual square patties. This book lacks the formal variety of Wenderoth's books of poems. Wenderoth is not, as a writer, always best served by forced brevity. And in ""Letters"" he seems so intent on shocking the reader and it just feels mildly arrogant. I wouldn't dissuade anyone from buying this book, but I prefer the poems full of large breaths and diamond honed crystalizations in Wenderoth's first two groundbreaking books."
4,Wendy's is the latest thing in literature,"I have never encountered a book like this before, laid out in such a snippet-like format where each page is a chapter. I also thought it was interesting that there were no page numbers. Apparently, we were supposed to use the dates of these ""sayings"" as page markers in the event we found ourselves without a bookmark or some other method of remembering our place. I thoroughly enjoyed Wenderoth's willingness to risk offending people in order to deliver on his point that we are all human, despite our proclivities and weaknesses. Good work."
2,i didnt like it,"hi gentles... when i saw the picture of this product on the web, i said"" Wow it`s look so soft"" but when i got it....i changed my mind by 180 dgrees..."
3,Is just OK,seems a bit Harsh and has a bit of a sting .Could be the hydroxy Acid was hoping for more of a skin repair and lift serum .will most likely not buy again prefer the night cream
2,Will not use this again!,"I LOVE L'Oreal's countour and night cream, so I wanted to try the day lotion. As previous reviewers have mentioned, this does crumble, and it stings. Some moisturizers do sting a little at first, so I continued using it. However, when my eyes began burning and watering, I thought perhaps I was allergic to this formula (I never apply it near my eyes or eyelids), although I don't normally have sensitive skin. Then I realized that it was flaking and peeling, so must have been making it's way into my eyes. The consistency is thin, my face feels dry when I use it, and the peeling makes it difficult to apply foundation. I will stick with the other L'Oreal moisturizing creams, I trust the brand, but did not have a good experience with this lotion."
5,"Terrific bargain in a strong, quality, maple work top","Grizzly G9916 Solid Maple Workbench Top 96"" Wide x 30"" Deep x 1-3/4"" ThickI'm using this workbench top as a counter-top with a sink inserted, in an enclosed garden room. (See Customer Images.) It looks great and is eminently practical, since the top can be used for virtually any type of project. We had considered buying one of those Formica-type counter-tops sold by Lowes or HD, but they are pathetic compared to solid maple.The wood is exactly the size Grizzly specifies. Search the Internet for comparable maple tops of this size and you'll see what a terrific bargain this one is. It's well made, very strong, the edges are slightly rounded, and the top and sides are sanded and finished. Of course, it's very heavy, so you'll need help to move it around.I ordered it on a Saturday and the driver pulled up to the house the following Wednesday. I helped him carry it into the garage. It's a very impressive product, especially for the money."
4,Perfect fit,The curt hitch was a snap to install 6 bolts and no extra work to install. The curt hitch allowed install with the spare to remain untouched and used the six pre-welded nuts on the frame. Only suggestion is figure where you want your wiring harness it comes with no mounting plate for that.
4,Xterra exhaust manifold,"Product was good. Well worth the price and might be better than the original. Only problem I had was that the Heat shield have issues. You have to cut a piece off and bend it a little for the screw holes to line up. Other than that, we shall see if it holds up better than the Nissan original. I would have gave all 5 stars if it was not for me having to rework the heat shield."
2,God Tussi Great Ho,"This movie is such a waste of time! While there were some funny moments in the moviewith Salman and Sohail Khan, it wasn't enough to salvage this mega flop. All the songs were terrible and sooooo...cheesy! Normally I love any movies with Salman Khan but this one is a real disappointment."
2,After 30 pages when I had to put the book down.,"I thought I would like this book after reading the review for it in romantic times. Uggh. I know many readers will disagree with me, but I can't stand plain heroines. I don't read books for reality I read them to be swept away into another world, I want my Heroines pretty and my heroes handsome, I don't want them dowdy or plain. Okay so in reality a handsome man (although I assuming the male character was equally appalling due to his scar - although I don't find scars unnatractive on men - the author made it seem like he was quite ugly. Who really want to read about to ugly people. Not I. Along with all of that I just found it boring. I thought from the prologue that it was going to be good but I was sorely mistaken."
2,Nothing new here,"If you have any toning videos, there is no reason to rent or own this one. The moves and pacing are nothing you haven't seen before. Jillian Michaels 3-2-1 Workout, Prevention 3-2-1 or Crunch Total Sculpt are all more fun, and have better instructors. This one just tells you over and over that she lives in San Francisco and you're gonna look great in that tank top! The segments also seem out of order, starting with a butt and abs routine (squats and planks, shocker!), continuing to a weight training segment, and finishing with a cardio/weight interval segment. It seems to me that abs on the floor is an end of the workout activity. Get a better toning workout that is motivating, and makes more sense."
5,Very effective!,Best workouts for the results you want! Alternative workouts would be needed if you want better results but it's great to keep you in shape!
5,Great workout video,This is one of my favorite workout videos. The ass and abs workout really targets those hard to reach spots. The workouts are easy to follow and you feel great after doing them. The 20 minute segment is perfect for busy days. Some videos you need to do for an hour but these workouts make 20 minutes of exercise enough to get you in shape.
1,Gross,"This is the first Kashi product I have tried. I'm used to the more candy bar type granola from Nature Valley or Quaker, so keep that in mind. I found this bar difficult to bite into and chew. It's not crunchy and its not soft really either. The texture and flavor was similar to styrofoam. I couldn't finish the bar."
1,Don't waste your time buying these.,"These granola bars were disgusting. I turned to the kashi brand of peanut butter granola bars because they were healthier. The taste is just horrible. I wouldn't recommend these to no one. If you like the taste of cardboard, then these bars are for you."
3,A Little Bland,"These were OK. Not terrible, but I don't think I'll be getting them again. I had high hopes based on other Kashi Granola Bars I've had, but these ones just didn't do it for me. They're a little drier than I would like, and (as the title says) a bit on the bland side. A bit of a disappointment."
1,Hard to use,"I'll echo others when I say first that this books has a lot of great information. However, it's difficult to actually learn from. It's very equation-based, which is good, but the equations are often simply presented without any discussion. The ambiguity of units is frustrating, and it's difficult to tell whether an equation has a typo or not. I really think it could be better organised. For my course, I ended up getting other textbooks on hydrology from the library and generally avoiding ""Physical Hydrology."""
2,"Good information, not so great layout","There is a lot of good information packed into this book but as a student, I have found it a very frustrating textbook to use. The reader is bombarded with equations without a good general overview first. A glossary would also be helpful. The units of many equations are left out. This is confusing since for many empirical equations, the units cannot be derived from dimensional analysis. Finally, like many hydrology textbooks, there are literally hundreds of Greek symbols used throughout. Without any glossary or table of symbols used in each chapter, it is very difficult to go back and find the original definition and derivation, should I forget what one of the symbols stands for."
1,A steaming pile of scatterbrained presentation,"I'm currently a student using this book in a 400-level hydrology course. This is quite possibly the worst textbook I have encountered in my academic career. It somehow manages to make even simple material that I already kind of know very difficult to understand. The writing style is very pompous and generally otherwise inaccessible. Variables used in equations are either not well-defined or used inconsistently. Examples, for lack of a better word, suck. Figures are confusing rendered. Organization is terrible.All in all, a fairly good textbook example of how not to write a textbook."
3,Just okay,"Physical Hydrology is okay. It was required for one of my classes, but I honestly did not use it very much except for when it came to homework problems. The text was difficult to read and understand at times (especially for me since I'm just an undergrad), and like others mentioned, the equations could have used further discussion rather than just listing the variables. It's not my favorite book but I am keeping it as a possible reference in the future. If you're looking at this book for pure pleasure or reference, I'd suggest looking at something a little easier to read."
5,Excellent introduction to Marrabenta music!,"Every song is a gem! This compilation has contagious melodies coming from the earlypioneers of marrabenta to the more comtemporary artists. Ialready have CD's of Ghorwane,Eyuphuro,and Orchestra MarrabentaStar which the Rough Guide pickedfine examples of their music.Of all the songs present, I especially loved the soulfulvoice of Wazimbo's ""Xigevengu"".This CD is a ""must have"" in appreciating the music of Mozambique."
1,Don't buy this product.,"I have owned and used Craftsman and Milwaukee 1/2 sheet finishing sanders and liked them both. I bought the Makita and sent it back as being unacceptable for the following reasons:1) In order to have the dust collector function, special Makita sand paper must be used or a special hole punching machine must be purchased in order to make the special sand paper required. 2) If standard paper is used, not only does the dust collector not work, but the many dust collecting holes in the pad do not support the paper, resulting in inefficient use of the paper."
4,Great Sander,"Really enjoy the heft of this sander and the variable speed option. No punch plate included, but not too difficult to make your own or use the included sheet of sandpaper as a template."
4,Wynonna,Wanted to find out more about Wy Judd. So thought this would be a good way to do it. Found out things about the whole family. Well worth the time to read if you are a fan.
5,enjoyable,The book arrived in good shape and in a timely manner. I had already read the book; that is why I ordered a copy to have for my own. I enjoyed reading her story.
1,Wyonna Judd,"I thought there was far too much repetitious and tedious comments about her mother as I found this boring. At times this country and western singer seemed like a little girl who had not grown up into the real world.I was surprised at how she trusted her managers and nearly ended up bankrupt. Whatever type of business venture you have, you must take charge of your income.Nevertheless, I must admit that as I live in Australia I had never heard of Wyonna Judd as country and western music was not so popular here.My tastes tend towards opera and classical music and I bought this book to understand America during that period.I was very surprised to read of the poverty this star singer had in her childhood, and sounded like the days of the Great Depression, rather than the current times.The book could have been better if more information was written about her triumphs and successes in her musical career."
4,a good read,I am enjoying reading this book as it gives a good insight into the life of this lady. I am especially intrigued with her level of faith in God as it seems a very hard thing to maintain living life on the road as an entertainer. Wynonna is a real person with real problems that many of us can identify with. She is no nonsense and down to earth. Would recommend this book in particular to women who have the desire to overcome their problems.
2,Waste of Money,"I am very disappointed I spent my hard-earned money on this book. The whole thing is one ginormous pity-party. All Wynonna does is regurgitate everything she learned in her 15 gazillion therapy sessions and workshops. And I swear she had to have been paid by Onsite to do this because the whole book is one big commercial for them. Needless to say, I was incredibly disappointed with this book."
3,GLAD I READ IT,"I am very glad I read this book but I only gave 3 stars because it was a little boring in some areas. Some parts just went into WAY too much detail about minor things (such are managers, records being produced, background singers, etc.) The ""meat"" of the book was great and uplifting but I felt she got off on a lot of tangents. I think she is a very strong woman and I think she has finally realized that she is tired of her Mom pushing her around and being the queen. It was eye opening that she nearly went bankrupt and I enjoyed seeing her understand the value of a dollar after she had been spending like crazy. It was a great read and I read it in 24 hours."
4,Overall A Good Book,"There were some interesting stories and lessons to learn from Wynonna's book. She's had the same relationship and financial challenges that many other people have, just on a bigger scale. So there's definitely something to gain from reading this. She tends to go on too long with certain stories to prove her points, but it's still a good read overall. Very much worth the purchase, especially if you're a Judd fan. Cool insights into their world."
1,Bad,I would have quit reading at two chapters but since I paid for it I'm forcing myself to read it. If you are the sort of person who doesn't mind small talk than you'd probably enjoy this book. Wynonna has about as much depth as a 6 year old.
5,Priceless,They say that if you learn one thing from a book it is worth what you paid for it. I learned several things from this book. They were mostly life lessons. To me...this book is priceless.
2,I think you have to be a fan to finish reading this...,"I was given this book by someone who knows of the struggles I have had in my own life. Both of us thought this would be a great read for me. I know little about the Judds, their music or their lives. I appreciated the insight into how her career got started. I truly enjoyed those first chapters. At the halfway mark I was bored to tears. Shortly after, I could not find any reason to go on reading. I still don't know what she was so pained over. That being said, I hope whatever her struggles are, that they have passed. I saw her perform on TV at the end of 2006 and she and her song were beautiful. Buy the music, not the book."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I bought this book on Kindle and was excited about reading it. It's a reflection of Wynnona's life and rather disappointing. I was especially interested in her account of The Judd's success, having already read Naomi's ""Love Can Build a Bridge"". Wynnona explains throughout the book her reasoning for her irresponsible and ungrateful behavior early in her career ~ and while claiming personal responsibility, she backhands her own mother throughout it. It's clear to see through the wordy smoke screen that she is resentful about her mother while all along claiming to care about her. The drunk driving conviction was hers alone and while stating how wrong she was for it, she puts her mother down in the next paragraph to detract from the seriousness of her own choices. Things her mother did in public that she says shamed both her and her sister Ashley are repeated again in this book. Wynonna is full of contradictions. 'Coming Home to Myself' reads like a pitiful veiled 'Mommy Dearest'."
4,Barbie's Unicorn and Carriage,"Great toys, too bad the Unicorn and Carriage cannot be purchasedseparately from the 'gift set'. Actual size is larger than it appears on-line."
4,Comfort first,"The shoes are quite comfortable, i work office so needed something like this, its very lightweight and has a removable insole if you prefer inserting your own insole...shoes is stylish as I got many compliments cause co-workers thought it was suede ...it actually does look so but its neoprene i think. Only issue I have is because the front of the shoe is neoprene and not say leather or something i fear my toe will bust through the soft fabric or de-shape it.I recommend it for people looking for a comfortable shoe and around maybe 200lbs...also note the fabric area is not water proof."
4,great deconstruction of Euro-centric academic epistemologies,"This book has been very helpful to me in recognizing why Religious Studies theory is biased toward dualistic epistemologies that limit the knowable to objects the ordinary mind can apprehend. This ""epistemology of limitation"" (p. 179) seriously distorts some non-Western systems and assumes their truth claims could never be true. Chapter 8 in particular deals with this topic. Great book, very refreshing and helpful if you work in contemplative and/or Asian systems."
5,"An excellent, myth-smashing academic book","This is an excellent book that does much to dispel both the Eurocentric and mystifying Orientalist myths that have grown up around the relation of East and West. A truly impressive piece of post-colonial scholarship that refuses to cater to the prejudices of Hindu fundamentalists, convert Neo-Buddhists, or Euro-American boosters."
5,DoggoneMedia,"Light, durable, and smooth quick to set up and my go to pod on most of my shoots. Best monopod for this price"
2,"Flimsy,shaky But its going to be okay with improvements","The mono pod is flimsy the bottom would surely topple overI will have to pour some glue and make it a permanent fixture to keep it from falling over,and also step on the legs when my cameras on top.I will have to set the camera timer delay five seconds to avoid the shaky stem of the mono pod.its going to work just fine in low light places where they don't allow tripods, it will also make a good flash stand!"
1,Really Really Bad Earrings,"The design is horrible. I could not get them to go into my ear at all. I was trying to use them for my cartilage piercing but the piece of metal that extends from the top to allow for it to lock onto the loop, makes it impossible for it to go through your piercing hole. It's ridiculous in design. The size was perfect, but since I can't even get it into my ear there's no reason to rate it higher than a one star since I have to return them."
2,true review,"small is an understatement more like micro, TINY, teeny, width of a human hair i have chain links in necklaces that are bigger in diameter and circumfrence"
4,good fro mothers present!,"good trip down memory lane...saturday mornings, cleaning the marquesina with pinesol and a broom...caundo un amigo se va on the stereo...and me going in circles in my bike...my mom only remmebers the 3 cold beers in the fridge!"
4,Extensive and updated,Most songs are remixed or re-recorded but the melody and sentiment still the same.
1,great saw but has one huge flaw,"i've using this saw for 2 years + and i love how comfotabble it is use and the slide is without a doubt the best out there . the problems start when u try cut 1/2 a degree or even 1 degree off the positive mitre stops . i usually fit 1 staircase every 10 days or so which angle is usually between 40 and 42 degreesI CAN NO LONGER LOCK THE SAW CLOSE TO THOSE ANGLES.also the positive stops wear out over a short period of time so there is always 1/2 depree or more of play at o,221/2,45etci'm going to try the bosch next (without the laser)"
3,Save your money and go without the Light,"I just bought this item a few weeks ago and right out of the box I plugged it up and tried it out and the very first thing was the light flickered for 1 split second and never again came on. I just finished contacting Makita about this and they want me to return the entire saw for something that could be as easy as replacing the bulb. I will have to see about getting a replacement bulb but they refused to send me a new one to have the entire saw replaced.However, the saw did work well after a full weekend of being broken in with installing new hardwood floors. But save your money on the light and buy one without."
4,Totally Smooth and Sweet,"I've had the no-light model for 2 years. The newer model has minor upgrades (i.e. front handel smaller). I bought this saw because its table rotates smoothly, and it still does! No stop or bevel problems ever! The motor has never appeared under powered but I use sharp quality blades. I did not give this 5 stars as I think the RH fence should be included. I added it but it's pricey. I agree that a quick release clamp would be nice too. My table saw now gets much less use, and I find little reason to own a RAS now. I too suspect something fishy about the bad review, could it be from a competitor's sale person. I question a review when someone implies they had problems from the get-go, and failed to return the product. Makita tuff, reliable tools for a quality minded professional! Just picked up their 7 1/4 Hypoid circular saw to replace my worm drive."
3,"Nice when new, not very durable.","I bought a LS1013 about five years ago. It was great when I first used it, but after awhile it wouldn't lock on any angle, or bevel, and the arm flexes way to much."
5,Great book for kids,This is a super book for kids looking for a Titanic book with not only a lot of pictures but a lot of info. With this book you could learn many things that you didn't know. Ken Marchall's work is extrodinary in the book. And the author gives a real veiw of what it must have been like to have riden the Titanic.
4,Very educational and interesting book.,"This book about Jack Thayers, and many others' experiences on board the Titanic and the disastor that took place. It was interesting and informative. The pictures were detailed, colorful, and large enough to see easily! I'd highly recommend this book for peoplf of all ages. True story about Jack Thayer, one of the survivers, and Harold Bride, another one of the survivers."
2,"fairly good book, but...","I am a Evangelical Christian who has lived for almost 10 years in the Muslim world and was often disapointed with Dr Wagner's analysis. Although he was often right in the big picture, many times he was either uninformed or disengenious in the way he presented the details.His book is a perfect example of one of the Muslims main criticisms of Western Christian leaders, that we twist things to our advantage and whenever there was any doubt present the people of Muhammad in the worst light possible.I would not recommend this book to people who do not already have a solid grasp of Islam and its peoples, or one will come away with a distorted view."
4,Riddick,The 2 movies are a pretty good transfer since there is not enough si-fi out there. Chronicles of Riddick directors cut stops at chapter 4 on new and old player I have not heard of one person that could play that version?
2,Same problem,"Pitch Black plays perfectly, but for some reason Chronicles is still terrible in this set. Most of the reviews I saw for this product were from almost a 7 months ago and this set still is having the same problem. Basically the Chronicles disc freezes up about 14 mins in and then jumps 4 mins forward and won't even allow for you to rewind from there. What the heck? So much for QA testing. Amazon needs to stop offering this set since this is clearly still a problem."
1,Good movie but bad disk,"I have a defective disk; it freezes at 14:00 into Chronicles of Riddick, sits there for awhile, resumes at 16:02, and never shows the Director's Cut, even though this is what I selected.Because I bought this as a present for my husband's birthday, it was delivered 10 days before he got it. However Amazon starts their 30-day return window when it's delivered, leaving him 13 days to watch it, which due to family commitments he was not able to do.We're now stuck with a defective copy, and Amazon won't exchange it. While the movie itself is a good one, be SURE you watch your movie before your 30 days are up or you might get burned like we did."
2,Locks up my Blu-ray Player (BD P1400 - Samsung),"I own a regular DVD of these two movies and liked them so much that I thought of adding the blu-ray version to my collection. Unfortunately, the disc locks up the player when I tried to play The Chronicles of Riddick and could not go any further after I get to choose from the Theatrical Version Vs Directors Cut. I was able to play Pitch Black once thru the end while it locked up in between once. I could never get to play this movie again."
1,Production Problems,I picked up the single Blu-Ray version of Chronicles Of Riddick and it was unplayable on my system. This is the first disc I have ever had a problem with and I just read the previous review stating that this two movie set may also have some mastering problems.Are we in for a major recall on this movie?
1,How much!!!!,"This is a hard to find book,but who the hell is going to pay 999.99 dollars.I'm sure a better price can be found."
3,Perhaps a better song choice...oh well,Pretty solid effort by the kings. I'm just not too fond of the song selection. Garden meanders too much and Hummanizzimo is not that great. However there are some real highlights namely Stardust We Are- absolutely amazing. The Truth Will Set You Free starts the dvd in awesome fashion. Silent Inferno is also great. Overall worth it except for some suspect choices for the concert. I would still recommend it for the songs mentioned above. Probably a 3.75 star rating.
2,RATHER DULL ACTUALLY,"On record the kings (apart from the odd lapse) are excellant (although i find Kaipa far, far superior)but visually they are dull, dull,dull and this though brilliant packaged and recorded is about as exciting as a Bob Dylan gig meaning nothing much happens, completely without movement and visually staid. Even excellant songs on audio like 'stardust' come over live as tedious as some of Yes's latter excursions. As brilliant musicians as they obviously are this for the watcher an endurance test, even the extra's drag on interminably. My other bone of contention is the second guitarist heavy metal poses which are laughable and maybe would suit Van Halen, but in a prog mode totally unecessary... Just like this dvd. Stick to the audio."
2,There was a new edition in 1997!,Amazon's on-line information is not up to date. There was a new (and much expanded) edition of this book in 1997.
5,Simply The Best Mixer Available!,"Previous reviewer stated ""where is the recipe book and guidance""Answer to that question is other than a very few receipes their is none. However, The machine is easy to figure out once you understand it's mixing concept. When in doubt, place adjustable arm all the way out & then increase speed while slowly readjusting arm inward until desired mixing achieved. Really very simple once you get the hang of it.Mixer it'self is terrific, will do anything & everything but stand on it's head and gargle peanut butter.No need for the dough hook when making a few loaves of bread & adding ingredients is a snap due to the uniqueness of the mixing action which leaves the whole front half of the Mixing bowl unrestricted by a head or beaters.Summing up! A very high quality product sans a receipe book."
5,it is the best stand mixer on the market,we got this mixer a year ago in a willams snoma store and it knedes doguh the best over any kitchien aid or delonghi or dualit from uk and it comes with a 8qt s/s bowel and a plastic bowl with and all attachments you can call the company at 1845 368 2532 and thay will be on the phone with you to help you bake or any help you need on this machine the service thay give is the best. this mixer is hand made in sweden by the worlds largest appliances manufacture electrolux and it is a very stylish mixer you cant go wrong and it is not a lot of money for this quality mixer and if you want to bake like a pro is this the mixer to buy
5,Retrospective view of Pioneer Land Artist's career,"_Nature: The End of Art_ showcases the richeness and diversity of the many phases of Alan Sonfist's career. The highlights include documentation of the many public projects that Sonfist has done over the last 30 years, but equally rich are the reproductions of Sonfist's many paintings and photographs."
2,Too bad . . .,Too bad there's so many pictures of Alan Sonfist in this book. We would rather see his artwork.
3,Masterpiece!,This song is a masterpiece. The Radio edit is the best radio edit you could ever hear it just sends chills down your spin. As for the other 2 mixes well lets just say there ok but when it comes to the radio edit it rules the air-waves. It's a classic & also a unique song in which no other trance song can compare to it. I would have gave this cd 5 stars but it lacks the Oringinal-Full Length Mix.
5,Great book,"I loved this book, very informative regarding the railroad line that Spreckles built in the Salinas Valley. The photos are beautiful...."
2,"Box Very Damaged, Didn't Open","The top I received looked as though it had been through a war. They either need to change shippers or package this product so it can be shipped more than a couple of blocks.I had this product shipped twice!! The first was returned, the second I didn't even bother taking it off the truck.When I contacted Grizzly they suggested I buy it from a local source. In other words take your business elsewhere. I find it incredible that a company that ships products all over the world can't seem to package it properly so that it will arrive in reasonable condition. The ""Shop Fox"" supports I bought with this were in TERRIBLE shape! A local merchant says Shop FOX is owned by Grizzly and they sluff off their damaged or unsaleable products through Grizzly. I have ordered the supports through a local merchant. We will see if they arrive directly from Shop Fox in good condition.Shop Fox H2612 Super Heavy-Duty Workbench Leg System"
2,Looks good but was dinged when I got it.,"I got one of these from Grizzly for a workbench I am building. It was shipped by New Penn Motor Express. When it arrived I helped the driver unload it. I noticed several dings on the cardboard. I thought it would not be enough to damage a hard maple benchtop and I was in a hurry to get it into the house. I did not note the damage on the BOL. When I unwrapped the top I was dismayed to see damage in several places, several of which I thought were significant. I think I would have to hit it as hard as I could with a framing hammer to do the same damage. I realized I was out of luck because I had signed off on the BOL. After e-mailing photos of the damage to Grizzly they offered to send me a $50 gift certificate.Other than the damaged places the top does look nice---no damage would have rated five stars. If you get anything from Grizzly or that has been shipped by New Penn, I recommend that you check it carefully for damage before signing off on the BOL."
2,Not a great story.,"I was surprised that there were all 4 and 5 star ratings on this book. Not that exciting of a story, though it did move quickly. The main characters weren't that interesting compared to other romance novels I've read. Also, being a NASCAR fan, I felt it was almost silly to explain a lot of the rules/activities since most of the people interested in reading this are NASCAR fans. Just not a fan of this one, but will still read others in the series."
1,"Not enough Bacchus and too much ""me.""",Typical pretentious fare from an over-rated has-been. House and Garden magazine? Egads!
2,i hope jay reads these,"listen: irreverence is one thing, but just blundering around with a few dangerous pieces of knowledge, blurting out the same tritenesses about wine is a(whole)nother. mcinerney tries to accomplish with numerous disclaimers the same thing that anthony bourdain so fails to in kitchen confidential; that is, he wants to say ""hey, this is just me talking. i don't know much, but i'm irreverent and handy with prose"" and so on. it's a losing gambit. the actual nuggets of knowledge in bacchus & me can be summed up as follows: helen turley good, la grande dame good, california chardonnay flabby and overpowering. other than that, i now know that mcinerney has garden parties, wears prada loafers, and has been given a job--writing about wine while learing about it--that many others would gladly kill him for. i was left feeling one thing after reading this book: why not me? good christ, i'd have done a better job."
2,Disappointing after 'A hedonist in the cellar',"I read ""A hedonist in the cellar"" first and the reading was so enjoyable that I was looking forward to this one. It turned out that ""Bacchus & Me"" is not as good...Not to mention some repetitions between the two books, I think ""Bacchus & Me"" are more for the novice wheras ""A hedonist in the cellar"" would be more for already advised hedonists.I was sometimes bored with Bacchus and Me, despite the good writing and the humor sprinkled now and then, and I found the topics not so original (again as opposed and compared to ""A hedonist in the cellar"".In a Nutshell, I recommend much more McInerney's second book about wine."
5,Great product for gluten-free baking,"Potatoes are one of the more highly sprayed crops during its growing cycle, so I am willing to pay up to get organic. Also non-organic potatoes can be GMO."
2,Star Reporter,"Star ReporterStar Reporter is a book that reveals many things in adolescence, as the interest of men with girls. This book tells about a boy who knows about a new girl in town, and he get interested in her and wonder who this new girl and begins following her, but everywhere he sees he does something wrong, it is very funny. His father owns a newspaper, and his father Steve two him to replace his friend that was sick and the Steve's of father needs new material for the newspaper. Steve interview people who were already Stars in journalism, an interview Steve that is the father of the new girl who are vied in town called Marietta and Steve finds out and meets Marietta. Well I liked this book but he author should have put more action, suspense and comedy to improve the book."
5,Jazz Classic re-issued in CD!,"This is a must-have album for the Latin Jazz afficionado. Originally recorded in the 1940s and 50s, this album features Machito and his Orquesta with special guests Charlie Parker and Dizzie Gillespie. It is on this album that you will find the classic jazz suites Tanga, The Afro Cuban Jazz Suite, and the Manteca Suite, all of which were arranged and conducted by the incomparable Chico O'Farrill."
3,Recommended with hesitancy,"This is a hard book to rate. I think it's ultimately helpful for those who have next to no understanding of biblical theology (the intended audience as stated by Goldsworthy). However, there are some troubling epistemological assumptions behind the work that I think are dangerous to those who are uninformed (the intended audience of this work as stated by Goldsworthy). So I think I would recommend this book to anyone starting with chapter 8 which is where Goldsworthy actually begins to explore the narrative and theology of the bible.I am troubled by the nature of reading the OT through the NT and by the epistemology presented. Luckily these things don't seem to come through after chapter 7."
3,Mr. Goldsworthy's Best Book!,"If you enjoy Mr. Goldsworthy's book Gospel and the Kingdom, you will love this book. It is much more organized and thorough. It is probably my third favorite book on the subject of the Kingdom behind Announcing the Kingdom and God's Big Picture. The biggest disappointment of this book is Mr. Goldsworthy's assertions (assertions because if Scripture might imply a truth we have not right then to assert it) concerning Christ being the New Isreal and, thus, reading a ""spiritual"" reality into every promise of God following Christ. Up to that point it was an excellent book, but Mr. Goldsworthy's presuppositions force him to interpret scripture without foundation. A good book and a must read if one is very interested in other viewpoints on the Kingdom."
1,This album is crap!,"This is a very terrible album. It has a lot of tracks but they're only seconds long the beutiful long end themes you remember are not in it. There are save room themes and sorta new. All this composure did was incorporate a lot of NOISE!!!none of it is good if you want the good ending themes or the beutiful, yet repetitive room themes, and out of respect of the small save room scores i call them instead of repetitive I'll say they have a lot of repetition since that was the idea and purpose of those tracks. And even if you enjoy scary themes you'd think this sucks. You'd probably say; ""Hey, this isn't scary this is crap."" The music for some odd reason reminded me of rusted metal being clashed together, over, and over till it drove you up the wall. And most of it is synthesized. So what is the point of have it called the BIO-HAZARD SYMPHONY.Strovinsky would vomit on this album."
4,possible fix for dead batteries,"drill works great with a lot of torque. i like that it has 1/2""chuck and power to go with it. had the drill less then a year and one of the batteries wouldn't take a charge. i thought it was dead. what i did was take an old phone charger the kind where it plugs directly into wall. i cut off the end jack and split and stripped the double wire. after using a meter to determine which one was (+) and (-), the single contact on battery is (+). i hooked it up to battery for a few minutes. battery is now taking charge in milwaukee charger. they do say don't let the batteries completely discharge so it seems it just needed a little charge for the milwaukee charger to accept it. hope this helps."
1,Buy Makita or Dewalt,"I purchased my Milwaukee drill in Spetember of 2002. I made an informed decision after much research. Based on reputation, torque and features. I was initially delighted. The drill had quick charge, lots of power and felt good. 7 months later my first battery pack failed and was replaced under warranty. Now at under 2 years of ownership, the second battery has failed and the original replacement is dying. The batteries are $60 each and are failing at a rate of more than 1 per year. I am not a contractor and have given the drill moderate use and excellant care. I wrote to Milwaukee via their web page twice. They promise a response in 24 hrs, it has been a week, I am still waiting. So their customer service is just as lacking as their battery packs. Try the Makita Mforce"
1,Milwaukee batteries are a bust,"About 2 years ago I bought the 12 volt drill kit and couple of months later bought the 14.4 impact driver kit [both Milwaukee]. Having been a long time Milwaukee fan I expected no problems... Fourteen months later my first battery went dead and a couple of months after that two more went out. The tools themselves worked fine but the batteries are garbage. I understand Ryobi bought Milwaukee Tool. Ryobi's batteries have a similiar history. I used to think if you bought Milwaukee you had a first rate tool, now it seems it's just a third rate tool."
1,"Not a ""professional tool""","I took a chance and bought this drill. Boy was it a mistake! Anyone who uses this drill professionally or on a daily basis will not find it adequate. The housing of the drill is cheap, the seam where the two halves of the drill come together splits apart slightly under high torque driving and actually pinches your skin. A slight fall off the top of a two foot stepladder split the case apart and missaligned everything. Recently while drilling a 7/8"" hole with a spade bit the drill just quit working. I returned it to the big box to hear I wasn't the only one wanting my money back. I will be returning to the P-C which gave three years of tough service before it gave out."
1,Dead Again,"I am a contractor who owns 11 Milwaukee power/cordless tools.I bought this drill in 4/2004 in July on a job site it quit. I took it to a Milwaukee approved service center, after 10 days in the shop (parts backordered) I asked if they would call Milwaukee to request a NEW drill kit, I was told it would be better if I called and I did, a day later a Rep from Milwaukee called and I told him the situation they next day the drill was ready. Two weeks ago same thing DEAD. This time no calls from anyone at Milwaukee. Try Hitachi"
5,real fine machine,"i have only owned it for a couple weeks, however comparing it to my experience to the the PC 310, it is much quiter,lighter and the feel in my hand is amazing. i plan on using it as a cut out tool as well, so light weight and a solid one handed grip was essential to me.. the led lights work nicely, and I believe the description doesn't mention the soft start feature.very smooth and quiet...this makita doesn't even move in your hand when you turn it on! clear base is nice too...and this model has a bearing guide base attachment, for bits without a bearing, if you desire to use it,or you can take it off..."
5,gift,I choose this gift because my son wanted it. He hasn't tried it yet but is sure it will work like he wants it too.
1,Pretty much a total waste of money,"This tome reads like it was rushed to market to cash in on the (hoped for) popularity of Sybase tools for internet and distributed programming. It has some very basic, very high-level, very general information on internet technology (COM, CORBA, IIOP, etc.). This information is not specific to the Sybase toolset and could be found anywhere. Only about 1/10th of the book has anything to do with building distributed applications with Powerbuilder (or PowerJ) and that material suffers from a crippling lack of real-world examples. If I could give this effort ""no stars"" I would. My advice is to skip and save your money for the Barlotta book.I also find it interesting that several negative reviews of this book have been dropped during the last month. Be not deceived. Dropping one set of bad reviews will only result in more bad reviews being posted, because this is a bad book."
1,please have the courtesy to write reviews in ENGLISH,"saf sads kadduss adfd powerbuilder sai ni domb sybase daf sadVery helpful, huh ?"
4,Audio Drop On 1 Track,"I've got an audio drop on track ""Flight Feet & Root Hands - Andreas Vollenweider "" at 3:15 position. The CD looks ok with no noticeable physical defects. The drop occurs when in any CD player, or in MP3/WAV formats. A wave editor confirmed the drop."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!!!,This costume is horrible. The fins and mask are made of the most flimsy plastic I have ever seen. This was the biggest waste of money I ever spent.
4,Gripping. Beautiful!,This books prologue took me away. I fell in love with eduoards character. And my heart went out to Helene. This book brings out a lot of emotions and is extremely gripping. I had to keep reading and the characters play on your mind. The love between eduoard and Helene is intoxicating! Good read. The author writes beautifully.
1,Unrealistic and trashy,I would like to know what the editor was thinking while time was supposedly spent editing. There are more holes in this novel than there are in a pound of excellent Swiss cheese. I was under the impression that it was supposed to be realistic but found a collection of Smurfs more believable. Helene's run-away from Edouard and subsequent marriage to Lewis made absolutely no sense. Most of the characters are unrealistic and come from La-La Land. Thad's relationship with Lewis from the very beginning was farcical. As a matter of fact most of the characters were reminiscent of a fantasy or a nightmare.
2,A 2 1/2 STAR REVIEW,"Supposedly, with DESTINY Sally Beauman became famous for receiving the biggest advance for a first novel. One has to wonder why. Not that the novel is a goner. Beauman clearly knows how to write. Her prose is as eloquent as her setting and characterization. A lot had been invested in this novel, and kudos for that since the woman definitely has all the makings of a best-selling author. But despite DESTINY's many powerful moments told with warmth and flair (like the outcome of the heroine's childhood friend, for instance), the novel lacks strength. Predictability wins over substance. Beauman's destined to be together characters H'l'ne and Edouard are a likeable duo, and karma sure does wonders for both of them, yet without much of originality to boost up its sagging plot, Sally Beauman's first major outer since penning a few Harlequins (as Vanessa James) leaves much to be desired.-----Martin Boucher"
5,Couldn't put it down,From the first page you are drawn into the story and I couldn't wait to find out how the story would end. It was the first book I have read for a long time where I just couldn't put it down. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read.
4,Great game.. if you have some friends to play it with,"This is one of the superior fighters out on the market today. Wonderful graphics, sound, and gameplay! The different combos, reversals and grabs always keep it interesting. I would like more stages to play on for the different game modes such as tag team and survival, but the one they provide is good enough. This game is most fun in multiplay. Tag team is awesome, and the interactive stages in the Versus mode really get the blood pumping. If you don't have anyone to play with however, the fun may not last long since there are very limited options in single play aside from Story, time attack, and survival. There are no secret characters, mission mode, etc. But if you get some friends together, be prepared to be playing for a long time. Dead or Alive 2 is addictive!"
3,Good fighting game,"I currently own Soul Caliber, Marvel vs Capcom, and DOA2. Doa2 is a good game and has some good points but out of these three it is easily the least fun. For the price marvel vs Capcom is the best but the depth of playability in Soul caliber is incredible especially the Mission modes and point system allowing players to purchase art which in turn opens new aspects of gameplay such as new characters, levels, costumes, etc,. . . I haven't played Virtual fighter 3tb so I can't comment on it. If its a choice between this and Soul Caliber go with Soul caliber. Doa2 is good but the others are way better and cost less."
4,"Great Gameplay, Hot Babes!","This game shows off the awesome potential of the Dreamcast platform more than any other game. Graphically, it is superior to even the mighty Soul Calibur. The fighters themselves are beautifully rendered. The physics are very realistic. Best of all, there are not stupid ""magic powers,"" such as in Mortal Kombat. It is just pure fighting, with lots of unexpected surprises. The characters look like thay could inspire a new computer graphic anime genre. If you like fighting games, click that order button now!"
5,One of the best looking game on Dreamcast.,"I personally owned all three versions of this game: Dreamcast, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, this game look even better when connecting VGA cable to your HDTV or PC monitor, the picture looked sharper and crispier than PS2 version with component cable (480i only), only DC and Xbox can output true 480p (not available on PS2 version). If you don't have Xbox or PS2, this game is a must own for Sega Dreamcast."
5,This Game Kicks!,"DoA2 is by far the best fighting game out for the Dreamcast. Amazing graphics, amazing moves, and amazing cinemas! The only downside is that most people say that the game gets old real fast. No secrets or extras make the game's replayablity very low, but I don't find this a problem, and it isn't if you have friends to come play with you in the tag-team mode(the best feature). I'm sure any person who likes fighting games would love this game."
4,Fun until it gets old,Very realistic if you know what I mean. It does get boring after awhile. Some of the moves are too difficult to execute. Great game to rent then see for yourself before buying. Could be better if you could choose the locations. Different costumes are a plus.
2,Good but not great.,"DOA2 is a fun game to play with friends that can play it also.First off the game has NO extras. That in itself is disappointing!Secondly, the single player game [...] BIG time. As a result the team battles and versus battles with friends are all you will have to hang on to.These 2 flaws really killed the game for me. I love extras and a good single player mode since I can't have friends over everyday.On the plus side, the graphics are great and the gameplay is fun, espically with friends. I'll recommend this game as a good game to play with friends. If you don't have that option then you couls let it slip by."
2,"Gorgeous visuals, terrible everything else","It's no Soul Calibur. Lacks alot of extras... I mean c'mon - of course I want a great arcade port, which this is, but it's for a console... where are the extra's? The layout and character design just plain ..... Just compare the quality of the voice acting in DoA2 with Soul Calibur and you'll see what I mean."
5,Very Addictive & Super Fun game,"If you like games like: Soul Calibur, Shenmue, Street Fighter (all versions/sequels), Mortal Kombat (all versions), Tekken (all versions), Oni, or any martial arts/karate game out there, then you will love this game. I played this one at a friends house for 1 hour on expert level and beat it. I love that game so much, it was very addictive...I don't own it yet, but i am looking to buy one for less [money]......"
3,Not what i expected...,"First of all, let me say that this is a pretty good game. However, there is not much to it. Once you beat it ( 2-4 days max), there is not much more to do. The graphics are chrisp and clean, the sound is also quite good, storyline... well you will have to be the judge of that. (TIP) Put the GD-Rom in a PC computer with a CD-Rom and check out the pics on the game disc, quite good if i do say so myself. Also of you want to see a slighty better intro read on... Check it out. You won't be disappointed."
4,Great fighter.. but not without its problems,"The problem with this game is that it came out after Soul Calibur. It's going to be compared to it no matter what. And since there's NO extras on this game at all, it's just not as good to someone like me who really doesn't have another player for 2 player games. Dead or Alive 2 is a fantastic fighter, but for a decent single player experience, I have to go with Soul Calibur.. if you have people to play against, go with Dead or Alive 2"
3,MILDLY AMUSING,"As a SOUL CALIBUR fanatic, I have to say DEAD OR ALIVE 2 is a weak alternative. There are lots of cute, scantily clad women with, well, you know what they have...but swinging mammaries doesn't necessarily make a great game.There are some neat differences between the two games, like the multi-level arenas, the edges which cause damage, and the continuous flow team battle mode, but still, I found myself always thinking it wasn't nearly as good as SOUL CALIBUR.The graphics are definitely worth checking out, though.Now, if someone where to make a DEAD OR ALIVE 2 Movie...that'd be something I'd probably recommend! ;)"
3,3.6 STARS,"This is very fun but after you beat it there is not much more you can do except play your friends. I suggest buying it if you love fighting games and you are tired of the Mortal Kombat Golds, Trilogy's. All good games just remakes of each other. But I'd say, if you want to buy this...DON'T. Get Dead Or Alive 3 for XBOX but if you can't get an XBOX or DOA3 for it buy this if you are still hanging on to that Dreamcast."
3,Excellent game at first.,"This game graphically is as good as Soul Calibur. When you buy this game at first you'll think there's so many modes of play that you'll never get bored. But you're wrong. After you beat all the modes about 50 times it starts to get boring. So, if your thinking about buying it, just rent it."
3,Wowzers,"This game has the best graphics. they are amazing. The major downfall for this game is it is WAY to easy, I beat the game on every level from easy to very hard in less than 2 days. It is a great game to rent, but it isnt one of those games that it takes a while to beat."
5,Jimmy Nails it,"What I like about this album are the melodies, lyrics not to mention Jimmy's voice.I am surprised this has not had more airplay."
1,Useless when needed,"The AlcAlert BT5500 is a novelty item and I do not recommend relying on it for an accurate reading of blood alcohol content. The display showed ""SAT"" (saturated) at least 75% of the time regardless of prior use or level of cigarette smoke in the room. The instructions say to shake it 5 or 6 times but that does nothing to remove the saturation level. Therefore, the item is useless. Pay the extra money for a better device."
3,Maybe it is the device but...,"It seems to work except it reaches the ""saturated"" level very quickly (when I am in fact, not saturated :-)) My brother bought this for me and he said that it is unusual and has never had a problem with his. I will send it back to see if it is an error with the device itself. I like it for entertainment reasons, but I can see how it would be very useful to have in the car. It is hard to argue with a digital readout! It is very tiny so convenient for a purse or car glove compartment.The price on Amazon is good and since it has a 90 day guarantee, you can't lose."
2,Not Armin's best,"These sets are just OK. If you're into Progressive then you'll love the first disc and if you're into dark techno-ish trance then the second disc will make you smile. Since I prefer uplifting melodic trance that can be found on ""Boundaries of Imagination,"" ""001: State of Trance,"" ""002: Basic Instinct,"" and ""004: Tranceparance,"" these CD's just didn't do it for me.The first disc is as boring as ""002: Basic Instinct's"" first disc with only one good song being the last one (Vincent de Moor's ""Flowtation 2001."" The second disc reminded me of Tiesto's Spage Age 2.0 with a lighter touch. It did contain more good tracks though.All in all, buy this CD if you're into Progressive and/or dark techno-ish Trance. If you expect Armin's usual uplifting melodic Trance, you'll be disappointed."
2,Not Armin's best by any stretch of the word...,"Having listened to 67 of Armin's Ibiza sets, and his very first 001 State of Trance set, I have to say he really let me down on this one.I know that people have different tastes in music, but the progressive style that made AVB so distinctive in my mind seems to have been lost on this set: I began to see it in his second one, but this one really broke the camel's back.Most of these songs aren't progrossive at all. For me, this disc was definitely not as enjoyable as the first album--namely the first disc: There's not a single bad song on that disc. It's the kind of CD you can pop into the stereo and listen to from start to finish. Not so with this one, though. I spent most of my time listening to this CD by flipping tracks; and only listening to about 5 seconds of each song to boot.All in all, if you want really good AVB, go for his first. The songs actually have a point."
1,this product does not work,"used semi perm hair color. purchased this product at a Beauty supply, used it. It did not remove any of the black stains, even though it clearly shows a picture of a woman with black hair stains on the bos, before & after. Just did not work at ALL!"
5,Absolutely soothing,"I listen to this CD over and over and over on a daily basis. It's THAT great. It's not merely relaxing background music, it's more like a great dream from which you don't want to wake up. At work it creates such a peaceful halo around my desk, but I would love to have it on as I drift off under a one hour massage, or while curled up with a book at 2 AM. Anyone that listens to Hearts Of Space on NPR should own a copy of this."
4,The Morrigan's Call,"A recently I came across Cruachan's THE MORRIGAN'S CALL at my local library. I was immediately intrigued by the cover, and by the picture on the backside of the cd case. My initial impression was that this was a celtic band so being a fan of celtic music, I checked out the cd. I wasn't too far off that this band played celtic music however I was quite surprised (in a good way) by the heavy metal riffs. THE MORRIGAN'S CALL is definitely not something I was used to hearing in terms of metal. The fusion of celtic folk and black metal music took some time to grow on me but eventually I grew to enjoy the album. I particularly enjoyed listening to Karen Gilligan sing but could have lived without hearing Keith Fay growl or bark. Keith's vocals kinda ruins the beauty of the band's music for me. I enjoyed most of the songs except for when I hear Keith's singing. Overall THE MORRIGAN'S CALL is a solid folk metal album worth checking out."
1,not released yet,"Cruachan recently changed labels, which seems to have delayed the release of their new album. October update: Cruachan website now gives new release dat --> 17 november... Wait and see..."
5,Let the Madness Begin!,"This is the 1st book of the 9 in Grant's Typhonian trilogies, and it sets up and sets the pace for the following works, which just get more progressively and detailedly weirder. These works can really draw you in, especially if you have a fair working knowlege of what Crowley was really about, Kaballah, tantra, and magick in general. There is stuff in these books that has never been printed elsewhere, and I don't claim to fully understand it all, but that's how a good occult work should be....intuition needs to be at work as well as ""understanding."" Highly recommended to the serious occultist."
5,A great story!,"Young Rose Webster has lived in the slums of London all of her life. But unlike many people, Rose wants more out of life and she knows that an education is the only to better herself. With the help of friends and the love of Bill she maybe able let that happen. But after years of remembering the past will Rose be albe to move on and will Bill be there with her?""The Open Door"" was the first book that I had read by Beryl Matthews and it was really great! Ms. Matthews gives the reader rich and real characters. I can't wait to read more by Ms. Matthews."
2,"Charlee Bear Dog Treat, 6 Ounce Liver",I paid over $6 for only 6 ounces! I usually am able to get 16 ounces for the same price. I was ripped off!
2,OOPS! Incorrect Product Description,"Most dogs I know like Charlee Bears. However, this product was listed to be 12 bags per purchase. I purchased two sets (24 bags) to prepare gift bags for 15 dogs. I was very surprised when 2 bags were shipped. I had to fill the gift bags with another treat. However, the seller quickly responded and recognized there was a problem with Amazon's description. I received a full refund from the seller."
3,the best and worst of the chisels,"This collection of songs is a mixed bag. On one hand you have classic tracks (almost all at the start of the CD / first side of the LP) like Saturday Night, No Sense and Flame Trees and on the other a heap of tripe tucked away at the end. You can hear Jimmy Barnes screaming on several tracks like he's continued to do ever since (as opposed to singing). Virtually nothing any of the band members has done since matches the best of this album, but it's too patchy to rate higher.I really like the way tracks 2-7 flow together musically and thematically (eg Ghost Town, Painted Doll, 20th Century, Saturday Night)- very much a snapshot of the seedy underbelly of Sydney in the early 80's."
5,The BEST.,"This book, has to be the best book out in print regarding a great overview of such a massive corpus by St. Thomas Aquinas. I used this same book while in the Navy to help understand our Catholic Faith. Helped clarify my thinking process and helps you get to the core of concepts like ""justice, equity, religion, politics"" and such. This book is great to read daily, for research and to help with the general understanding of Thomistic philosophical concepts. A must for any student of Catholic Theology....! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
3,Crowned in the Middle,"The first workbench top that Grizzly sent to me arrived with a complete crack down the center. This crack was clearly caused by mishandling by Saia Motor Freight, the shipper. There were other major problems in Saia MF's delivery to my house (details of which are not worth elaborating on here). Under no circumstances should you allow Grizzly to ship your top by Saia MF.Grizzly handled the replacement of the top very gratiously, and they shipped the replacement by Fed Ex Freight. It arrived in fine condition: very nice finish and smooth.BUT: as others have experienced, the workbench top was not flat across the narrow dimension. In my case it was crowned in the middle by nearly 3/16"". After debating to myself what to do (use it anway? go through the hassle of returning it?), I finally took it to a local cabinet shop that has a 36"" drum sander. For $30 they sanded it flat, and now (after I added a finish) it's a very usable workbench top (although it's now only 1-9/16"" thick)."
2,not flat,"This is a ""workbench"". that was bowed in the middle by about 1/8"". I have pictures with my level in case Grizzly wants to see them. If someone is doing wood work, this won't work. I am a contractor and luckily it is being used as a laundry folding bench, but anything other would not work. Just the hasle of repacking a 165lb slab of wood and then trying to swap it out. Really? I have used Boo's before and will go back to Boo's. Too bad, I think Grizzly is a local company and I like to support local companies."
2,Nice cheap butcher block bad company to deal with,"Butcher block is nice. It is in much better condition than you would think for the price. Shipping was $70. I bit the bullet and did it anyways. The company selling these emails me afterwards to inform me that it will cost me additional money to use the lift gate just to lower it to the ground. Otherwise, you better have some strong folks around because this thing is heavy. Very dishonest upfront shipping costs in my opinion. Product would have gotten 5 stars if it was not for the shipping mess."
4,Characters,"If you're looking for epic storytelling, this is not the book for you. ""Who Do You Love"" is filled with tales of more-or-less ordinary people. However, the author makes the stories extraordinary by fleshing out the motivations, thoughts, feelings, desires and flaws of her characters so ingeniously that by the time you finish the book, you feel like you've made a dozen new friends. Although somber, the tone is more sympathetic than dreary. This collection offers beautiful insight into the lives of modern, everyday, American people, if you have the patience and empathy to go along for the not-entirely-fast ride."
5,Absolutely wonderful!Very heartfelt.Amazing.,I can't believe what a wonderful story. An incredible job of getting the readers involved. Very detailed!!! THat always makes stories great! It seems so real. It made me want to help both Annie and Scout. I can't wait to buy the book!!!!!!
2,Not an easy book to share....,"My girl friend travels much, and when she does, I usually read her to sleep from one of my many story books. I purchased this text with that intent in mind. One could probably enjoy this book as an individual reading, but when used as a story telling book the reading definitely requires some finessing to get through."
3,He made me do it,"I bought this out of obediance to David Sedaris, like other people who have reviewed this book. While written beautifully and beleivable prose I found it a painful and sad book with NO happy endings and little laughter, which seemed in direct opposition to the source of the review that I purchased from."
2,A Little Disappointing...,"I bought this book because David Sedaris recommended it at the last reading I attended. The stories are all on the ""dark"" side and they do not appeal to me. Admittedly, I prefer something much more light hearted, so others may love this book."
5,First-hand recall from the mouths of all the horses.,"Assuming any prospective reader is already interested in the history of the Beatles, don't be misled that it's all been said before. There is new material in this book, but more importantly, it legitimizes random folklore into direct quotes. It also chronicles events in the early years that are less researched I think. The author seems to purposely omit any reflection or opinion. This pulls you through the entire saga, devoid of the usual narrative, fully aware of the grim undertows that you always know are there. The back of the jacket photo says it all. It's an extremely haunting photo of a locked gate to Strawberry Field. It looks so abandoned while it continues to beckon you. Not unlike this book. Why it is not on the cover instead of the back I'll never know."
1,Horrible,One of the worst Stones books I ever read. Rehashed qqoutes from other books. Hardly any Brian Jones. I would not recommend this to anyone. Absolutely horrible. What a waste of money.
4,tempting combination,"Adobe offers this combination of their Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements, as a unitary text. The aim is to show how you can learn both in a synergistic manner. That there can be a seamless transition from dealing with your static images to pasting together video and images. All of which is offered with powerful tools in each package.Perhaps the main reader for this book is one who wants to use Premiere, and is considering Photoshop. For the majority of Photoshop users, who will not be creating videos, the book is superfluous, however well written it might be."
2,It's True About the Batteries,"Previous reviewers who complain about the short life of the batteries are absolutely correct - and this applies whether you have used the drill much or not. I only used the drill a few times, but after 18 months the 2 batteries that came with it are both caput. The batteries are expensive, they have to be ordered, and it would be more cost effective to just go buy another, cheaper, brand of drill. Maybe it wouldn't be as initially powerful as the Milwaukee, but I'd still have a working drill when I need one."
5,"ITS MILWAUKEE, WHAT CAN I SAY!!!!!!","I have worked in the construction area for 20 plus yrs. I have owned Makita,skill, ryobi,craftman,dewalt,black&decker cordless tools. This drill is so strong. I wish I had bits and screws as strong as this tool. Lots of laughs. Bits just shatter or strip off. Screws have just twisted off. I Have put this tool to its test. I do tile work also,, Lock and Load a 2 foot paddle and mix up some thin set in a 5 gal bucket. I have! It might get hot but it keeps on going and going. My electric dewalt gave out on me. I laugh at you all that don't give this tool it's respect. This is the 4th drill of Milwaukee I still own. I also have 2 combo kits I have purchased. I do have a dewalt drill at the house my wife can use. BUT A real tool needs to be by my side, at the job. Keep up the good work Milwaukee.. For those battery critics, I have burned up many of the competions faster than milwaukee's. My Milwaukee's have lasted at least over 2yrs. THE BIG RED ONE"
3,One year later,"When I first bought the drill, it would run all day on one battery. Now it seems like battery life is much shorter. Went through two batteries the other day before noon. Lots of power originally. Take the other reviewer's comments re: batteries seriously."
5,Simply the best,One of the finest tools i've ever used. reliable with Power to spare. A bit on the expensive side but well worth it. 2 batteries included.
2,"Great drill, shoddy battery","This monster of a drill has torque and speed to burn. Sadly, the batteries Milwaukee provided me with both died within six months of my acquiring this drill. Repair/replacement of the batteries will cost nearly as much as buying a new drill.I sadly placed the Milwaukee back in its case and returned to my trusty DeWalt 14.4v."
5,None better for the professional!!,"As an electrician I need a drill with power and to be portable and this is the tool for the job!! I can do anything on the job with this drill that corded and plugged in drills can do!! I can drill holes in panels, wireway, gear, transformers, you name it all day long using a step-bit or uni-bit by interchanging the 2 batteries, charging one while using the other. On top of all that I use the hammer-drill mode in between all of this to mount equipment on block wall using a tap-con kit. Needless to say I am impressed!!All the other guys on the job are using cheap cordless drills and everyone of them come to borrow my Milwaukee 0624-24 18 Volt 1/2"" Lok-Tor Hammer-Drill Kit, when they need to do a REAL job that needs a drill!!Buy with confidence!!God bless,Shannon Peltonhttp://www.1stpromotion.com/pro/?webmaster=your1"
5,Electrician,"I tried a high voltage hammer/drill and this mil left it in the dust.The other 24v H/D Was also higher,Much higher in price.THANK YOU MILWAUKEE FOR DOING AGAIN.A LOYAL CUSTOMER, LUIS ALVARADO.CLIFTON,NJ"
2,"Great Drill, Pathetic Batteries","Always been impressed with Milwaukee tools over the years. Used and loved them when I worked construction in my younger days. Bought this drill just over 1 year ago for household use. I don't use it Professionally. Drill was used maybe 20 times bascially as a screwdriver. The drill is in mint condition, but the batteries are both dead as a hammer with no warning. Didn't weaken or anything, just one day they'll no longer charge.Big waste of money for me."
2,BATTERIES SUCK,"GREAT DRILL, TERRIBLE BATTERIES, 60% BATTERY FAILURE AT LESS THAN ONE YEAR, I WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN ON THIS BASIS ALONENO PROBLEMS AT ALL WITH THE PANASONIC BATTERIES AND THE DRILLS ARE AS GOOD, LIGHTER, BATTERIES HAVE MORE AMPS, ARE EASIER TO REMOVE AND LAST FOREVER. YOU DECIDE !"
4,Chasing Rumi,I love Roger Housden's 10 Poems books and have been a fan of Rumi for years so it seemed a natural for me. I found this book to be good but not as great as i had wished. the story is a bit to simple for my taste but it does share some lovely little insights and moments. I have not yet finished it so maybe by the end it will be love but for now it is like.
3,An UM Overview of A Stranger in Dadland,"The title of our book is "" A Stranger in Dadland."" This book was really interesting. It was written where younger children and older adults could enjoy it. The book is set in California, andis based on a father - son relationship. The relationship is not one of the greatest, because the father does not have time. The brother and sister nicknamed their visit to see their father ""Dadland"" where the only thing they see is his life. This book is a great learning tool, with students who's parents are divorced, or students that do not have a great relationship with one of their parents. For teachers, the book gives great examples of signs to look for and help. "" A Stranger in Dadland"" is a great book and a good read."
5,The Most Beautiful Recording I Know,"This is a magnificent performance, and I've never heard a better recording of a stringed instrument - better even than Julian Bream's guitar recording of Granados and Albeniz. This is the most relaxing music I know. A desert island recording!"
1,Bluetooth DOA,"Got one, Bluetooth didn't work unless unit was <70 deg. F.Cheaply made; Holux has NO customer support - they just told me to contact the dealer, not even an apology. Check other online support forums -- the Bluetooth defect seems quite common. Instructions even state that unit won't work if it gets too warm.USB plug on unit is actually a serial port, so can't use it as a GPS mouse unless you buy the special Holux cable.Bottom line: when you're on unfamilar ground, who needs an unreliable GPS unit?"
1,Holux GPSlim236 is junk.,"I bought this device and it worked great for about 60 days. It would connect to the satellites quickly and held a long charge. After the first 60 days, the Bluetooth light barely ever comes on and if it does, it may never full initialize or turn back off within a few seconds.Buy something better. This unit is not worth your time or money."
1,Failure of Bluetooth means poor choice,Such a promising device. Worked great with Google Maps on my Blackberry right until the Bluetooth stopped working. Many people seem to have this problem and Holux support is non existent.
5,Excellent GPS,"Fast, small, cheap (the lowest price), long autonomy and precise... nothing bad to say about this good GPS"
1,Bluetooth stopped working after a year,"I've had this gps receiver for over two years. It worked well for about a year. Now the bluetooth transmitter in it doesn't work, and I cannot connect or pair any of my devices with it.The bluetooth blue LED doesn't light up, or stays continuously on, instead of flashing intermittently as it's supposed to. If I restart the unit several times, I can sometimes get it to work.Additionaly, the battery is sensitive to heat. I left it on the dash for a couple of days once, and the battery swelled up, and I could not close the battery lid since.I'm definitely not buying this unit again."
2,Good when works,I've had this receiver for few months now and for the first few months the receiver worked great. I was very happy with the performance when it worked. The receiver was able to quickly lock into satellites and it worked better than my friend's magellan in urban area.The issue is that for the past month my unit's Bluetooth has been working intermittently. Searching the internet it seems that few other owners of this receiver has been getting the same problem. Holux customer support is non existence so pretty much i'm stuck with a $100 paper weight. Dont make the same mistake I did do your due dilligence before spending the money to buy this product.
2,Bluetooth DOA,"Purchased one based on the splendid reviews, but when I got mine, the bluetooth didn't work (didn't even light up). I think it found its position quickly, but I could not tell because the cable to hook it up directly is sold separately."
2,Hmm,"I had this unit for almost a year working perfectly. Loved it. Then one day the bluetooth just stopped working. It will not connect and the blue light does not come on. Definitely appears that somehow the bluetooth stopped working for some reason.Holux has no support number and they have not returned any of my emails to tech support asking for help, after several months of trying to reach them. I am finally giving up. I would not buy this unit, especially now reading how many people are having similar issues. I like the look of the Holux 240, but the support from Holux is disgusting."
4,I don't understand the low star,"I have owned three GPS receiver. Garmin 2720, holux 236 and Garmin ique m3.Well, garmin 2720 and ique m3 are not just receiver but their reception is nothing compared to holux 236.Always more accurate and faster reception. (NY area)If you think about the price difference, this is pretty upsetting for garmin product owner.The only reason I give 4 stars, not five stars is that although it can pair with more than 1 PDA, sometimes it gives me trouble when the PDA that I wanted connect can't connect."
1,You get what you pay for,"I mistakenly bought a few of these thinking they'd be glass--like my old ones. Mistake. A thin (I mean THIN) plastic. I was too lazy to go back and check if ""plastic"" was used in the description. But I knew as soon as my UPS driver handed me the box something wasn't right--it was light as air. No--as light as thin plastic. Alas, they might work come spring. But I'm from the old school--I like heft. And somehow bird feeders gotta take a licking to keep on ticking."
5,touching and unforgettable,"I found FBI Girl to be both touching and unforgettable. Conlon-McIvor's adeptness at describing the details of her youth will resonate with anyone who grew up in ""suburbia"" in the '60's and '70's. I felt like I was at the dinner table, in the FBI car and in the classroom along with young Maura as she navigated her way through her quiet childhood. Her book reminds us that sometimes the quietest amongst us have the most to say. How lucky for us that she found her ""voice"" and shares it with us through this loving memoir to her family. This story will stay with you for a long time."
2,Just not what I expected,"With a title and subtitle like this, I was expecting something completely different. It is not about the FBI - the title is just the author's ""code"" for her efforts to puzzle out what was going on in her family during her childhood, and especially what her uncommunicative father thought and felt. She chose this title because he happened to be an FBI Agent. If you enjoy reading about family dynamics and psychology you may like this book a lot more than I did."
2,If you like your coffee bland this is for you!,"I tried several different types of coffee roasts, different size cups using the various settings and found the coffee lackluster. Maybe it's just the type of coffee machine - as a one shot machine the coffee isn't hot enough and therein may lie part of the problem. If the water were hotter, the coffee might have more flavor. If you really like a good cup of coffee, don't buy this product. If you don't care about taste and just want the convenience, then go for it."
1,Do not waste your money!,I purchased this machine after using my sister's Senseo. The Black & Decker doesn't even come close to the quality of the Senseo coffee system. The coffee from my new machine is disgusting and it seems to take two cycles to even get a full cup. I just tried the new latte pods and they don't perform or taste any better. Instant coffee is better than the coffee from this machine. I am going to purchase a Senseo and throw this piece of junk in the trash.
1,"Horrible coffee, horrible machine",Do not buy this no matter what the price! I just bought mine for 20 bucks on sale and it is probably the worst coffee maker I have ever used. I know others have said they get a good cup of coffee but mine tasted burnt and bitter. I still have the taste of it in my mouth. YUCK! After my cuisinart broke I just couldn't bear to pay 100 dollars for another but now I realize that there is a reason to pay that much! I will definitely never consider going cheap again. I am not sure how this product is even allowed to sit on the shelves. Well that is my 2 cents anyway. Save your money for a cuisinart or a bunn.
1,TERRIBLE!!!! Zero stars would be too many!,"The first night it seemed noisy, but OK. Coffee was good, but not hot enough. Over the first week it began to make less and less coffee. Pushing the 9oz button would produce a 4oz cup of coffee, 14oz button made a 6oz cup. About halfway through the seond week, it began to leak profusely. By the end of the second week the pump stopped working entirely. I returned it and got a Senseo, which, so far, seems to be working much better."
1,Home Cafe - waste of money,Just like most of the reviews before - this thing brews lukewarm coffee and I have to heat up my coffee in my microwave after. Getting the pod holder lever to close is a struggle. It is just waiting to break. When I bought the item from Target...the checkout lady asked me to keep the receipt carefully....guess this item earns frequent flyer miles for returns.
1,Leaky Pot,"I have had this system almost since it came out, at least 6-8 months, and at first it worked fine. I had a part break, the cup that holds the filter but it was replaced very fast by customer service, but since then it has never worked right. It leaks all over the counter every time I make a cup and I can't figure out from where and often the coffee is very weak. I do not recommend this."
1,AWFUL,"My husband had purchased this item as a gift and without any prior knowledge about coffee machines. Well this one is horrible. It makes a terrible noise when brewing. There are three settings on the bottom to measure how much to brew, I have tried all three and the result is always the same... not enough! When the cofee is finally ready to be drunk it tastes awful. Save your money on this product. I wish we had now we are out about $60.00!!!!"
2,Poor Design,"Had trouble with spray head leaking because it was difficult to get the head to latch correctly and it would sometimes unlatch itself (fine if you had a towel handy). Didn't care for the taste of the coffee either after trying 4 different brands or blends. Bought a Senseo, this thing is sitting on the shelf."
1,Broken after one week of use,"I have used this coffee maker for one week...about 10 cups of coffee. Today, it decided not to work. From day one, the unit appeared to be flimsy. I called their repair service and was instructed to cut off the plug and return it with a check for $5.00 and they will send out a replacement unit.I will do this, but it still won't improve the quality of the unit.I was impressed with the quality of the coffee output from the machine, but I want a dependable unit."
3,Objective comparison: Senseo is better,"The title says it. If you're in the market for a pod brewing system, buy the Philips Senseo. I've used both the Home Cafe and Senseo systems and prefer Senseo.Both make a good cup of coffee, though I think the Senseo's is a little better. The Senseo is also a little easier to use and clean."
1,"IF YOU DON'T TAKE THIS ADVISE, YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU GET!","This is my third Black & Decker machine over six months. We used it in a small office. We like the pods because there is no leftover stale coffee. Everyone can have their style of coffee from the different flavors, styles and brands of coffee we purchase. The problem is the plastic lever assembly. It breaks all too often. We were lucky to have purchased it from a retailer that has an easy open return policy. But we are tired of going back and forth to the store. The store owner recommend that we try the SENSEO brand machine. Problems solved!I originally purchased Black & Decker because it is a brand that I grew up with and learn to trust. I do not work for Senseo or Black& Decker. I just want a machine that works If you decide on a Senseo, I suggest that you try SAMS club, because their machines has features that other retailers lack.I also don't work for Sams, either. I hope this helps you."
1,Terrible coffee - threw out the whole thing,"I bought this hoping for an easy way to make my husband ""leaded"" coffee, and ""unleaded"" for me in the morning. I tried all types of things - different water, filtered water, more or less water (cup size), and whatever I did the coffee was terrible. I ended up throwing the whole thing in the trash, bought a Senseo, and by making 2 cups with the 1 cup pod am VERY HAPPY finally."
1,Piece of Junk,"I purchased this when it first came out on the market thought it would be great for just one cup of coffee in the morning. Purchased the cappicino pods from the home cafe website and wanted to try those, they didnt fit. The top of the machine after you put in the pod wouldnt shut. Called customer service and was told yes they knew there was a problem and there engineers were working on it, took my name and number and said they would get back to me when they had it fixed. That's been over a year ago. My question, why sell the pods online or even the coffeemaker if they knew there was a problem??? Now all my coffeemaker does is leak all over the place. This is going into the trash today, dont waste your money on this coffeemaker, spend a little more and get something you know will work."
1,B & D Home Cafe Junk,This is the worst device I have ever used period! I was dumb enough to send in for a replacement unit the first time it almost started on fire! I tossed the melted remnants and recieved my second unit which leaked after 3 months of use. I again sent that in to recieve my 3rd unit which leaked after 3 uses!!! Don't buy this unit!!! Stay away!!! Listen to all the reviews!!! My options now are to get a fourth unit or eat my investment. I am begining to see a trend with Black and Decker quality.
2,Great Idea but needs improvement,"I bought this item because I wanted to save money with by making single cups of coffee. The concept of the machine is great and the Milstone coffee pods make the best cup. However this machine needs to be recalled because water comes out the bottom of the machine and where the cord exits the machine after every 3 cup in a row you make. I am not talking about a little water we are talking alot and this is an electric shock danger. I took the machine back thinking this was just a defaulty machine, well it was not a defaulty machine, same thing happened on the second one. I would not recomend wasting your money on this machine."
1,Really great- if you like to drink mud!!,Love the convenience- hate the coffee! I used the Folgers and Maxwell House pods and they both produced the weakest coffee ever. I even tried 2 pods at a time and it was a disaster. The new cappuccino pods are not good either. The Senseo is much better- wonderful coffee!!
1,"Great idea, poor taste and quality of construction","I like strong European style coffee, and I'm the only coffee drinker in the house. Received it as a Christmas gift. Tried the Folgers and the Millstone brands. Millstone is one of my normal brands, so I was very hopeful that this would work out.I agree with the other reviews, the construction of the unit is weak. More important to me, the taste of the coffee was terrible.I returned the unit yesterday!"
2,Bad Machine,The locking handle is a horror. Very difficult to close or open. The coffe is lukewarm at best. Machine drips way after use.This machine needs a complete overhaul. Don't even think of buying it.
4,FASTER THAN DRIVE THROUGH,"This machine is great,,Im a coffeeholic,,i love coffee...I can tell you that Ive used the Senseo and the Home Cafe,,,and its a freakin tie when it comes to taste..bothe are great......The only reaseon I went with the BD is that you can choose sizes.Yes it is a little loud,,But who cares.its only for about 30 seconds."
1,"BAD, BAD, VERY BAD!","I am a larg coffee drinker. When the Home Cafe was introduced, I thought, this is great! Boy, was I wrong. The coffee is wonderful, after you put it in the microwave to make it hot enough. The product, however, is another story. While taking it out of the box, I was afraid of breaking it. When I started brewing it vibrated so loudly that I woke up my wife -- she thought I had my electric sander going. The pod holder snaps broke off after the third cup so I took it back to the store where I bought it and got another one. This one lasted longer. By the end of the week the pod holder broke in two from top to bottom. I have decided that it is just not worth the trouble or the cost since I can still use my stainless steel perk pot.My suggestion -- If this plastic toy is going to be kept on the market, the pod holder and lock should be of stainless steel and some how get more heat in the brew.Note: I am taking mine back to the store to get my money back!Ron, the coffee lover"
2,A very disappointing product in comparison with other types,"I purchased a Black & Decker Single Serve Coffee Brewing System because I trusted the Black & Decker brand. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I have owned single serve coffee machines made by Mr. Coffee and Melitta, so I have actual basis for comparison. First, the flavor of coffee produced by this machine is unsatisfactory in comparison with that of other machines; I suspect that either the water is either not being pressurized sufficiently or is not heated sufficiently. Secondly, the machine is slightly awkward to use in relation to the other brands. Apart from these issues, however, the machine has an excellent form factor, price and brewing time."
1,Crap Coffee Fast!,"If you are at all particular about your coffee, then this is not the device for you. We have one at our office, and we like our coffee here. This gadget is a neat idea, and it is probably really handy for someone in a cramped space or who does not need to brew more than a cup of coffee at a time. Or if you are stuck on an island and you win this as a reward.The problem is that it just isn't very good coffee. We've tried a few things to eek some good brew out of it, and it just doesn't work very well.I'm glad that it was free, because it would have gone back if I had to pay for it."
1,Piece of junk!,"The lid doesn't seem to close right with the coffee pod in place. Two out of three times the coffee comes out looking like weak tea, and that's with French roast! Trying to contact B&D now for a refund, and the phone lines have been jammed....some customer service! I wouldn't give one of these to my worst enemy."
1,Couldn't even get it to work,"I bought one at a local store and it did not work, I called B&D Tech Support and they said to return it to the store. I returned the first one and that did not work either. So I called B&D Tech supprt again and they told me to send them a $5.00 check and cut the end of the plug off and send it to them,. Oh and by the way it would take 4-6 weeks to get another one."
2,Flimsy construction was it's downfall!,"I bought this machine over the others because it was the only one that made a 14oz cup of coffee.It wasn't worth it. The machine wasn't tall enough to accommodate our travel mugs so we couldn't use the 14oz cup anyway.The machine is very loud, and it splatters a lot (like, all over the countertop) when brewing.The pod holder was hard to get in and out, it stuck to the top. After a few months of use, the pod holder cracked because it is flimsy plastic.The Senseo is worth the extra $$!"
1,Total ripoff!,"I got this since it advertised itself as an easy way to make ""coffee-house"" coffee at home. Well, any coffee house that made the awful coffee this thing makes would go out of business pretty quickly. It uses ""pods"" and a few free ones come with it. I tried making a cup with one pod and the result was practically water with a horrible plastic aftertaste. So I tried to use two pods and that was a little better in that it at least tasted someting like coffee although it was still weaker than I'm used to and lukewarm with the plastic aftertaste and I still find my cheap drip coffee maker makes a better cup. Since the pods retail for about 20 cents each; for 40 cents per cup I would expect a much better coffee than this produces.And since most of it is plastic and it gets pretty hot and steamy while brewing I'm not surprised other reviews have mentioned problems with durability. Really the most useful thing that comes with it is the nice big plastic mug. Dont waste your money on this junk."
2,Trying to buy replacment parts...,POD HOLDER BROKE: After using it for less than one (1) month - the POD holder started breaking into little pieces. I have glued the peices back together... Mmmmm - glue flavored coffee... I see by the other feedback - I am not the only one who has had this issue...TEMP: The coffee is not quite luke warm - but it's not HOT - like coffee should be :-(Trying to find a replacement part is a JOKE.
1,"Luke warm coffer, no thanks!","Well, after getting a GREAT DEAL on this piece of junk, I took it home and followed the instructions.The first thing that bothered me was the ""chemical"" plastic smell.You have to prime it first, which is nothing more than running the machine once before using with the coffee pods.I did that twice to remove that smell.Then I tried it with a pod.Blechh!Luke warm FOLGERS coffee!I'd try it with another brand, but that's what it came with, and I'm now on HOLD trying with Black and Decker to find out why the coffee came out so luke warm.It's been 10 minutes now.Funny thing is, I bought a Litter Maid a month ago, and that was a piece of junk too! Same company.I'm not impressed with this coffee maker or Black and Decker.At least I can take it back."
1,Don't Buy this is junk!,I was in a department store about 2 months ago and spotted the Black and Decker Home Cafe. It was the first time I had heard of the idea of brewing coffee with pods. It was a spontanous purchase which is unlike me. Usually I look at items online and the reviews of others before I purchase items. This was the worst piece of junk I have every purchased. It is flimsy and the screen in the filter broke out and exploded all over my kitchen. It is all plastic what a joke. Everything the previous reviewer wrote is true. Please don't make the same mistake I did. I have since purchased the Senseo and so far am very pleased. What a difference.
1,Can't afford a better machine? Save your money until you can,"We'll start with the positives:*Easy to clean*Removable water reservoir*Convenient and fast*Good customer serviceNow the negatives:*Top of machine popped off when I first removed the reservoir - it was held on with double-sided tape!*Coffee is lukewarm*The coffee tasted TERRIBLE! (Yes, I used their Folgers brand.)*Rattled across my counter while brewing (can it brew if it never gets above tepid?)*When done brewing, the machine leaked all over my countertop*Customer service could've sent me a new one, but they're on backorder with no timeline for arrival (what does THAT say about the machine?)Conclusion: This machine is not worth the investment. Do some research (I didn't - my mistake) and get yourself a better system!"
1,The last Black and Decker appliance I ever buy.,"I agree with many of the reviewers. One, the coffee this thing makes IS good. It is unfortunate then, that after 5 months, it has to go into the trash. Yes, the construction is a huge joke; I don't think i've ever seen such a piece of junk. The thing has developed internal fissures in the plastic and has broken in several places, now it just leaks all over the floor and serves a nice hot cup of grinds. --an embarrassment to own."
2,poor brewing,"This system brews a very weak cup of coffee. I would not recommend it for anyone that drinks coffee but if you drink tea then by all means, because that is what your coffee is going to look like when it comes out."
1,cheaply made,"Fortunately (or unfortunately) I received this coffee maker as a gift this past Christmas. I was so disappointed that after only using it for 6 months that it broke while closing the pod compartment (the closing mechanism has always been a pain to use). It has always made ""marginal"" coffee at best, but I tolerated it as a trade off for a single serve quick cup of coffee. For a replacement, I decided to ""get what I pay for"" with the Bunn single serve coffee maker that got rave reviews. I would have never purchased this for myself in the first place if I had done the research on single serve coffee makers, but thought I'd give it a try since it was a gift. Very disappointed in the quality. I should have known better since I'm not a big fan of Black and Decker appliances in the first place."
2,Not what you think or want it to be...,"Not happy with my Home Cafe system. In fact, I have put it up and brought back my old Mister Coffee...now, what's that tell you in itself?Don't waste your money folks - it will never be Starbucks."
2,Home Cafe Review,"The Home Cafe from Black & Decker is for brewing one cup of coffee at a time. There's three cup sizes to choose from when you brew.A very large unit. As large as most 8-12 cup drip makers. The unit comes in white also.I couldn't believe my ears! This is a very noisily unit. My cat was wide-eye and scared when she heard it growling and spitting. My wife yelled from the bedroom "" What the $*&# is that?"". Guess I won't be using this early while others are still sleeping.Well I tried a few cups. The taste was okay but not as good as a drip maker. The clean up was decent I suppose. The one thing that disappointed me the most was the temperature. It was luke warm right out of the machine. I could actually drink the cup right down like water if I wanted to. After I added cream... well.... I think you get the idea.I'm afraid that the Black & Decker ""Home Cafe"" is quite a disappointment. If the unit at the very least served hot coffee then it may of been worth the purchase."
3,Good Machine,I really like this machine. I only wish that I could put a mug under it. The temp is just fine for me!!
1,Exploding coffee machine,"I purchase this thinking that it would be a great buy. After only 2 months of use I had a pod blow up! I mean literally blew up and shot coffee grounds everywhere. This is a joke. One of the pieces for the pod holder has already broke off and you cannot purchase a replacement online you have to call the headquarters which is only open Monday - Friday 8 - 5 Eastern. This is an awful product. If I could have, I would have given it 0 stars!!"
1,Unit burms up,This is my third unit. The first two were replaced by Black+Decker. My first unit bought in August of 2004 I used for about 2 weeks and the pod holder broke. They replaced the holder free and I was back in business for about another 2 weeks when the unit started making a loud noise and white smoke started coming out of the top of the unit. Was a horrible burning smell like wires burning. Black and Decker replaced the unit with a new one. The second unit came in October 2004 and lasted about 2 months when again the unit started smoking with a terrible smell. Had to uplug it and take it outside. Black+Decker said again they will replace it. I am starting to be afraid to use the unit. I do not recommend this unit to anyone till they fix the flaws.
3,Works fine so far,"I have had this for about 6 months now and so far so good. The coffee is great, I don't have a problem with it being too cold at all. It is a bit loud when brewing, but that is no big deal at all, especially since it is suppose to make cappuccino. I WISH I could try this feature, but I can not find any store that sells the pods for this. I do worry though as to how long it will last because it is plactic parts. I am happy with it so far and hopefully will be for a while."
4,Great For Cappuccino Lovers!,"I've had my machine for 6 months & I love it. I'll admit it could be more solidly manufactured, but nothing's broken yet. I use it SEVERAL times a day. The coffee is great, but I'm really addicted to the cappuccino. It comes with a specialty pod holder for making cappuccino. The drawback is you have to order the cappuccino pods from the Home Cafe web site. Not available in stores. They're made by Folgers & maybe they'll eventually put them in stores, so for now I'm constantly ordering them because I'm afraid of running out. I took my machine to work & made cappuccino for several co-workers & now they're hooked too."
2,Poor Choice After 4 Months,"The plastic seals on our coffee maker broke off after using the machine every workday for 4 months. Soon our coffee was not as strong and water leaked all over the machine and the counter. Pod coffee is great, but this product was a poor choice. I would not recommend this model."
1,"Single cup concept Good, but machine is Crap!","Like other reviewers, water comes out luke warm. I had to transfer my coffee into a microwavable cup and nuke it hot. Pod lid is too hard to close/lock. Way too much of a hassle. My machine is going back to the store for a full refund."
2,Will be looking for a differnt unit....,"I got this as a gift for christmas last year. The first 20 cups or so had the plastic taste that so many others have complained about. After that, the coffe tasted great. It was very inconsistant about making the right amount of coffee. I would have to push the 14 oz button twice to get 14 oz.After less than a year of use it just quit working. Bummer! I WILL buy a new one cup coffee maker, because the taste and it is easy to use and cuts down on waste, making it well worth it, but I won't be buying this model ever again."
1,Bad Taste,This machine makes the worse tasting coffee ever! The problem is the plastic container for the water. NOT the coffee pods. I called customer service (which is not Black and Decker) and basically they said nothing. I had to use vinegar and water to clean the tank more than once and still have the problem. So what I do now is to run the machine with clean water first and then make the cup of coffee. So much for convenience! Don't buy this unit. Not worth the hassle!
1,"Great taste , lousy product","First let me say that this coffee maker brews a great tasting cup of coffee , better than any others I have used over the years bar none . Now the bad news , the unit itself is very poor quality , the basket and the matching pod holder will last less than a year under normal use and then you will have to replace them as the plastic wears away and pieces break off . I have purchased two of these and had the same experiance with both units . Oh and if you try to ge an answer from these folks , you might as well talk to yourself . Sometimes you will get a reply but from what I have experianced there will not be an answer in there that relates to your question . Of course this is my opinion and as I said the coffee is great , maybe the Mr. Coffee unit is built to last .... I guess I will buy that one rather than throw another sixty plus dollars out the window on the Home Cafe ."
1,Black & Decker Trash,The B&D Home Cafe is a piece of Trash. It lasted about 2 weeks and then began began ejecting more water through the overflow hose then through the coffee maker. I didn't think I could go wrong for $19.99 (on sale at Kohl's) but I was wrong.
1,worst coffee maker,I agree with most reviewers. This coffee maker is a piece of junk. The few cups that I made were the worst tasting coffee ever.
3,Not bad for the money!,"I've Had my Home Cafe for just over 2years. I've used it everyday - seven days a week and it finally quit on me. Nothing cracked or broke, it just quit. I think it's funny that people have trouble opening and closing the area that holds the pods. My 3-year old knows how to operate it with no problem. For the money, I'm pretty satisfied."
2,Worked for a Year,"I used this appliance on the weekends for the first 6 months. After that, I began using it for 2 cups a day, seven days a week. It's been a year and the pod holder and casing around the pod holder have completely cracked. It costs $16 (w/shipping) to order the replacement part. My recommendation is to put your money into something that will last longer."
3,It leaks...,"Ok, I prep it by allowing water to cylce through it without a coffe pod. All is good, steaming water in my cup. Now I put a coffee pod in and start it up and it leaks. Hot water leaks from the unit and drizzles into and around my cup. I try it again with same results. And again with same results. I think I will stick with my B&D; thermal carafe.update: turn the pod holder over to the 14oz side and no leaks."
1,Noisy piece of junk,"This is the worst coffee machine!! Very cheaply made, hard to closecorrectly, noisy!!! I should have stuck to my old leaky coffee pot!! WASTE OF MONEY, EVEN WITH COUPON!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,I fought a battle for Black and Decker and lost...,"My name is Holly and when I saw the commercial for this I had to have it. My husband put up a fight b/c at the time it was $60.00, but I convinced him we would save money on the single serving pods(we didn't). Four months later this stupid thing has gone bonkers. The coffee maker would not turn off it kept running continualy, until I unplugged it. The plastic tray the holds the pods did not stand up to the heat of the water and became so brittel that it broke into 6 or 7 pieces. And finally the machine that wouldn't stop running stopped running completely. All this in four months!!! No wonder the stupid thing is only $20.00 now!!!"
1,My Black and Decker Home Cafe,"I was so excited to finally get my Black and Decker Home Cafe machine. I chose one that I recognized the name for.What a disappointment. I cleaned the machine initally like instructed. Again and Again. IT TASTED LIKE PLASTIC. EVERY CUP! Or is it possisble that it can scald the water so badly that it tastes like that?The handle seems as if it will break each time I put a pod in it.I probably only used this machine, testing it out, about 10 times, and was disappointed each time. I even tried the different flavors to no avail. Still a very bad taste to it. Luckily I did not have the trouble with the water leakage. But I probably had not used it enough.Mine is in the Goodwill box but may just go into the trash can.Terrible waste of money."
2,"Great idea, good price, poor product","Black and Decker usually sells good stuff, but this BD is just BaD. The pods are great and one can also buy a Presto (TM) mypod refillable coffee holder wherein we can use our own coffee. But the constuction is poor. It pees all over the counter on every use - so there is not as much time saved skipping the Coffee Store run as originally hoped - but at least it keeps the counter cleaner, as I have to stop and sop it up and clean it up after every use.Note to those who are already ""stuck"" with this product: I have found, through trial and error, that if you keep a needle handy, and thoroughly clean out the tiny hole through which the liquid runs into the cup AFTER EACH AND EVERY USE, it does work better - not best, but at least better./TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
2,Nice try Santa Clause....,"I received the B&D HCC100 for Christmas and being the only coffee drinker in my family, was excited about having a convienient way to make a single cup. Unfortunately this cheaply built maker produces marginal tasting coffee at a temperature you could take a bath in. I am going to exchange it for Halo 2 (Santa should have known I needed that game for my new xbox):)"
1,Terrible product!,I got this for Christmas and it was broken when i got it out of the box. The water would not cycle through. It was very flimsy and cheap too. I took it back and got the Panasonic Sensio which is a lot better quality.
1,Crap,"This coffee maker is crap. It makes horrible coffee and the actuall coffee maker is junk too. it spits and sputters the whole time you make the coffee, after you are done making the coffee it drips for over an hour. when watching it make the coffee it pours out mostly water. this coffee make is a POS- Piece of S**t"
1,Broke before I could make the first cup of coffee...,"I purchased this last night. I should have read the reviews here first.When I got home, I first ran it through a cycle with only water and no coffee like the instructions said. Then I added a pod to make the first cup, and when I was closing the lid, the coffee machine broke in two. When pulling the lever forward to lock the pod in place (which is very hard due to the flimsy construction), a piece of plastic broke at the back of the base breaking the machine into 2 pieces and exposing the guts of the machine.I took it back this morning for a refund and purchased the Senseo. The Senseo is definitely built better and it's much easier to work the pod door.Black & Decker needs to go back to the drawing board on their machine. The concept is good, but it's unbelievable they would put a product this bad on the market. It's not only bad for them, but it's bad for the coffee makers (Foldgers, etc) that support this piece of junk."
2,Yuck,"I bought this machine because I love coffee but hate the mess and time that it takes to make it. And, I just happen to love gadgets that are supposed to make your life easier. But true to form this machine by Black & Decker was very loud and poorly constructed. For example, the handle is cheap plastic and I was afraid that it would snap off each time I used the machine. The coffee was nothing to brag about either.If you love poor quality coffee that is made by a cheaply made machine then you won't be disappointed. I am going to try a Senseo and hope for much better results."
1,Poor Quality,"You would think B&D would put out a better product. The Home Cafe is cheaply made. The handle feels like it will break when you put in a pod (it's only a matter of time before it does..) Once your cup is brewed you'll need to wait a good few minutes before you remove your cup as the unit likes to drip for a while after your cup is full. Not very handy when you really want that first cup of morning coffee. You can remove the cup, but be prepared to wipe up the drips...<br />"
1,Waste of time,This was purcahsed for me as a gift and after one week I have had it. Coffee is luke warm and weak. I have tried several different pods hoping for different results with no success. I would not recommend any buy this product. I wouldn't even give it away. There isn't a zero star rating so I guess one will have to do.
2,Great concept ... poor performance!,"I bought the Home Cafe about 2 months ago. For the first two weeks, it performed flawlessly ... great coffee ... fast ... easy to clean! After that I noticed that the brewing cycles on all three settings would periodically deliver 1/2 to 1/3 to the serving size. I followed the manufacturers recommendations for descaling the unit using a combination of vinegar and distilled water. That improved functionality for three days and then the same problem returned. I cleaned the unit two more times ... each time without any improvement. The manufacturer has NOT been responsive in attempting to resolve the problem. I'm now looking for an alternative machine. When it comes to the Black and Decker Home Cafe unit, wait until they come out with a new and improved design, because this one doesn't pass the test of time!"
1,Bought two. Both burned out after less than two weeks.,"This has got to be a defective design. It often feels like you are going to break the handle to get it locked. Both of the units I bought worked fine for short period of time and them literly burned themselves out. They started smoking and them would not work afterward. Too bad, it makes very good coffee."
1,Doesn't Work!,"Even after reading all the negative reviews, I decided to purchase the unit hoping I wouldn't have the same problems. Well I didn't have the same problem (at least I didn't find one similar to my own). I prepped the unit as the directions described however my machine made a horrible noise. I don't know what it was doing but it was making a buzzing noise that was really loud but continued to pour water into my mug. After the cycle finished I tried the unit with a coffee pod. Nothing. Nothing happens. I've unplugged the unit and replugged it in. I have removed and reinserted the water container. I have unlocked and relocked the pod unit. When I press any of the buttons, nothing happens. It's like it's dead. I called their customer service number and he basically told me to do everything I've already tried. So I guess I will be returning it today and will give it another try. If I have issues with that one I'll just get my money back and wait until a new and improved unit comes out."
1,"Machine is poorly made, Keep your drip coffee maker","My wife bought this for X-mas and since she doesn't drink coffee it was perfect for me. It worked well since Dec. 25th, but it now spits coffee as it brews and does not seal properly. I also have noticed that when brewing a 14 oz. it gives me only about 10 oz. now. UGH!! It was a great idea but Black & Decker needs to redesign this piece of junk. Not Recommended."
2,Better for instant hot water,As a coffeemaker it is pretty disappointing but it could be that it's the pods. The coffee is weak and tastes like instant coffee. We have actually used it more as an instant hot water dispenser for tea and hot chocolate.The construction worries me. Every time I lock the lever in place I think it's going to break because the plastic is pretty flimsy. I don't see it lasting too long with regular use. It also very loud.
1,Piece of junk,Mine worked really well for about 6 months. One day it started spewing hot water all over the place. That was the end of that.
2,It leaks!!!!,"Yes, like may other customers my machine also leaked. It seems it's a design flaw. They used just plastic for areas of high pressure. It also splash coffee out of the cup, you has to clean the machine after every use ( I had a white one). Finally, the cofee is not hot. I like my coffee hot!.I changed my machine. I got a Keurig single cofee maker. works GREAT!!!. It's expensive, but you dont have problems making real good coffee, no splashing and a BIG!! variety of coffee and tea flavors."
3,Single Serve Coffee Maker,When I recieved the coffee maker I was impressed by how simple it was said to be. I found that it is in fact simple. Though the cups are by my standards not single serve...they do seem a bit small being only 14 oz at the most...but that is ok...I just think maybe some more sizes should have been offered on it. But all in all I do like the machine not to mention the clean-up...it is so easy...just take the coffee pouch out and throw it away! No mess!
1,"Lousy, lousy coffee maker","Excellent idea, I could not have been more excited to try it out. I returned the first one two hours after buying it because the reservoir leaked uncontrollably. I trashed the second one after trying everything I could to stop leaks from under the cup rest plate. I don't know why it deposits water there, but it does everytime it brews a cup, until it overflows and soaks the countertop. I'm tired of cleaning up messes!Stay away from this machine."
1,Useless piece of junk,"This thing works great, but brews room temperature coffee. It is terrible. At least it didnt blow up in my face like the Senseo though. Every one cup coffee make that I have ever owned has completely sucked. This was the 1st of many. STAY FAR AWAY!!!"
1,Piece of junk,"I got this for a Christmas present last year. Worked fine for a couple of months, except sometimes the coffee wasn't really hot. Coffee tasted good, though. Then, one day one of the pods exploded and after cleaning it up, I tried to make another cup. That's when the water started running and running and running. So I called customer service, and they sent me a new one. That worked well, until Monday when nothing worked on it. I pressed the button, and nothing happened. Switched to another outlet, still nothing. Call customer service again and they said they were retooling it and a new one wouldn't be available until August. She said they had had lots of ""major"" problems with this machine. I asked for my money back instead and will try to find a different one. Maybe I'll check out Gevalia or Senseo."
1,"Expensive price, cheaply made!","Ok, I bought this as soon as they hit the stores. A one cup machine is perfect for me. But this machine wasnt!After 2 months, I noticed some plastic bits in my coffee. Hmmm very strange. So I inspect the pod holder. Yup, it's cracked. So I call and get a replacement. After 3 weeks, I finally get the replacement. Great, on with the coffee. 2 months after getting the replacement, the pod holder is cracked again. And upon further inspection, the plastic holding the pod holder is broken as well. That's where the plastic bits in my coffee were coming from.Also, the locking mechanism was breaking into bits as well. So my husband told me not to use it anymore. I went to empty the water container to find my machine was also leaking everywhere!This thing has since went into the trash. I'm out $65 and am now researching the other One Cup Machines."
1,What a nightmare,"I am currently on my 3rd and last unit. The first unit would not close properly and the coffee spit out in all directions. Then I noticed small pieces of black plastic falling out of the unit when removing the used coffee pods. The second unit simply stopped working after two weeks. I am on my third unit which, so far, seems to work. I did notice that the new unit seems to close a little more securely than the first two. No spitting either. Overall, I am still disappointed. The quality of the unit is below par. Has the feel of a dollar store plastic toy. The pod holder feels as if it is going to break apart each time I attempt to close or open it. I expected more from Black &amp; Decker. Apparently, quality was not their concern. Shame on me for returning this item twice. I will try the Philips Senseo next time. Seems to be a higher quality unit."
1,Dangerous Junk!,I have always trusted the Black & Decker name. Until now. My first Home Cafe was used for about 2 weeks before the lever broke. Back it went for #2. #2 made lukewarm coffee so I called CS. Nice Lady sent #3 out immediately. Didn't even ask for the broken one to be returned. #3 immediatley leaked all over my counter. Called CS again. Nice Lady sent #4. #4 also makes lukewarm coffee. Called Nice Lady again. Told her I didn't want another coffee maker. She offered to send something of equal value. I told her to surprise me. She sent a food processor. (It works just fine). I still have #4 which still makes lukewarm coffee and not the amount that the buttons say . I just nuke it which kind of defeats the purpose. Maybe I should be very afraid since so many of them have exploded.
1,I tried 2 units - neither worked correctly.,"Regardless of the ""cup size"" button pressed, the unit produced random amounts of coffee - too much sometimes, too little other times. A few times it produced the correct amount. The unit is incredibly shoddy. I've bought my last crappy Black and Decker product!UPDATE! I replaced the B&D;'s with a Phillips Senseo pod coffee maker! Excellent quality and coffee from the Senseo!"
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK - Do Not Buy!!!,"Makes great tasting coffee for about a month before all the little plastic pieces begin to break. Black and Decker said they would send out replacement parts. 6 weeks later and the parts came; for a different coffee maker. Took it back to the store and they gave me another one. After a month of use (2-3 cups a day), it has broken pieces. Do Not Buy this piece of JUNK!!!"
2,"Great taste, broke in 2nd week","I chose to buy the Black &amp;amp; Decker brand since it gave you a choice of three different brewing sizes. The good part is that brewing one cup at a time is great and the coffee it brewed tastes great. The bad part is that it is very cheaply made, and it broke in the second week I bought it (not even sure why). But after one week of use it quit brewing the 9 oz (mid) size cups, which left only the small and large options. I took it back and am now looking for a better built unit."
4,Makes a very good cup of coffee.,"Coffee tastes great. I have the Folgers classic and Millstone Columbian blend. Both are very rich in flavor. So far my machine is working well and im not experiencing any of the leaking that some of the others have spoken of. I do worry a little about the engagement arm, it seems like in time it could wear out. but who knows mabe not."
1,I like Melita,"I have purchased both the Black and Decker unit and the Melita.The Melita I have at the office and it works great. I wanted a larger reservoir and decided to try the B&D; - it made one cup of cofee and then failed to operate. I, like anaother reviewer felt the lid closure was flimsey.I bought a 2nd Melita to replace the B"
1,Not a robust product,"The coffee is similar to my old Mr. Coffee when brewed strong, but I did like being able to quickly brew a cup for the road in the morning. However, the first one just stopped working after 2 weeks. I exchanged it for a new one. The new one has also stopped working after 4 weeks (starts then stops and flashes a red light at you). Very flimsy, poor design and prone to leaks."
2,Defective design?,"I wouldn't buy this product, especially for how much it costs. It apparently has a serious defect in it's design as mine leaks too! Sure, it's a minor nuisance, but this is supposed to be a product based on convenience. Ended up returning it."
3,looking for better pods,"had this for 2 months and it is ok...coffee is mediocre, and I am searching for better quality pods..."
1,Very disappointed,"Complete waste of money... Black & Decker can do a lot better than this. I've been buying B&amp;amp;D products for years but this one is zero rating. The taste is bad, the pod holder on the one I have cracked and fell apart. Tried to find a replacement but had no luck. So now I have a piece of JUNK!!!"
1,After 5 cups started spitting hot water everywhere,"I purchased the Home Cafe in April and until June couldn't find coffee pods locally. However the Senseo pods are identical.Before going through the coffee sample the machine started to spit hot water on the sides of the brewing cup. If I turn it over and place the pods in the side for holding two pods it works better, but the coffee isn't as good. It is getting worse and logging on at the Home Cafe site they won't reply to emails.This morning I brewed a 9 oz cup and left the room. When I returned there was approximately 6 oz in the cup and 2-3 oz all over the counter and on the floor. I've had to constantly clean coffee stains from the counter in a 12 radius from the machine. Even when it doesn't leak it tends to splatter out of the cup as it fills.Very disappointed."
1,Can't Get Past The Plastic!,"I have a Juan Valdez machine at home, so I decided to buy anotherfor the office, and bought the Black & Decker Plastic Machine.The pod holder is plastic and every cup of coffee brewed in thismachine tastes like plastic. That is not my idea of a good cupof coffee. The Juan Valdez has a stainless steel pod holder. Goodcoffee from the first cup. I am disposing of the Black & Decker."
1,"Great coffee, poor workmanship","This coffee pot produces great quality coffee quickly, but the quality of the machine is lacking. I've had mine for less than two months, and it is now inoperable. Closing the lid requires a lot of force, which has ended up breaking off various plastic pieces. Save your money for a better engineered coffee pot."
1,"Started out loving it, but...","I loved this machine when I first bought it, but eventually (3 Months) it started breaking down. First the pod holder cracked. I contacted Black & Decker using their email system. After a week, they emailed back an 800 number to call, & they replaced the pod holder free of charge. Then the cheap plastic tab that held the top closed broke. Again I called the 800 number (I had the foresight to not delete that email), and they replaced the machine for free. Then we had a power outage. When the power came back on, the machine started spewing water about the kitchen and a general burning plastic smell was present. Again, I called the 800 number. This time they again replaced my machine, but charged me $5 for shipping. The machine sits in my kitchen, unopened. I am contemplating returning it to Sear or Walmart, saying it was a duplicate gift, and buying something that works better. Don't buy this piece of junk."
3,For your consideration.,"I chose the Black & Decker over the other machines for one reason only; it will brew a single 14 oz serving using two pods instead of just one. For my purposes, that is THE ONLY reason I would have considered purchasing a single serving machine.It is not built like a tank, and the mechanism for loading the pods is delicate at best. But with patience and care I can make this work. It's nonsense that the coffee is not hot enough. Experiment with the different brands available and compatible with these machines,Senseo, Maxwell House, and Millstone are my favorites."
2,prematurely broken,"I used my coffe maker for about one month. Coffee was okay, but the plastic holder for the coffee packet broke. Where do you find a place to buy a replacement part? Have you ever searched for that? Good luck. Maybe I should just sell the remaining coffee packets. Any offers?"
2,"Great coffee, flimsy machine","I received this coffee maker as a gift two years ago. As a mechanical engineer, the machine itself makes my heart cry. The parts are a flimsy plastic that have been cracking slowly but surely over time. The pod holder is difficult to open and it feels like the handle will break if you push the end. I haven't had any problems with leaking or lukewarm coffee; the coffee itself comes out hot and tastes good. The only issue I've had is cracked parts."
2,Just pass this one on by...,I admit that the cup sizes and the reservoir are great. But the coffee tastes like plastic. This is not good. I took this back the next day.
1,Don't waste your money. There are MUCH better machines!,"This was my first single-serve coffee maker. While it did get me ""hooked"" on single-serve coffee, the machine itself was so poorly made, it virtually self-destructed right before my eyes. Online reviews of this machine are almost unanimously negative. Don't waste your money: start with one of the better-reviewed machines and enjoy wonderful coffee at home, with no mess, fuss, or waste.I now have a Keurig pod machine and absolutely love it. I use it not just to make coffee and tea, but also instant oatmeal and instant mashed potatoes. (Yes, it's possible to be a coffee snob but not an oatmeal/potato snob!)All the structural and functional integrity the B&D; coffee maker lacks, the Senseos, Melittas, Bunns, and Keurigs have. I have no business interest in any of these -- just want to make sure folks don't waste their hard-earned money on one of these junky ones from B&D.; And apparently I am not alone in that opinion!"
1,WORST COFFEE EVER,"The Black and Decker single serve coffee brewing system makes the weakest cup coffee that isn't even hot. On top of that there is a lingering taste of plastic to every cup. I gave this machine many trials. I purchased several brands of pods thinking I didn't like the brand of coffee. NO, it is the machine. Don't waste your time or your money. Spend the extra 30-50 dollars for a quality machine. It pays for itself in the long run."
1,Dissapointing,"My fantastic Saeco coffee machine went on the blink. I am awaiting a part for it and was going through serious coffee withdrawal. I needed something fast. I went over to Wal Mart and found this Black and Decker machine. I thought it would serve the purpose as a temporary fix. It was even on sale for $19.88. I even bought a few extra bags of pods. I rushed home anticipating a good java fix. I was quickly disapointed. Machine was not bad, but the coffee was just warm at best. Who the heck tests these products? unbelievable"
1,Be careful,"We recently purchased a Home Cafe unit in our local BJ'S. While preparing the coffee maker and ""flushing the system"" for the very first time we noticed a strong bad odor, the water was leaking into the electric compartment and smoke was everywhere. To make the long story short, we exchanged it for a new one on that very same day. The second unit started leaking from who knows where when we were trying to get it going. Disappointed, we returned it and bought the Senseo. This one has been working great from day one!"
1,3rd in one year! Choose another......,"We're on our third one of these coffee makers in one year and 3 months now. The coffee pod holder keeps breaking, so somehow it ends up making watery coffee. If I could rate it 0 stars I would. Retail on this maker is $65, so you'd think with the price and the name Black & Decker, it would last longer than a few months.We have returned it twice and could only exchange it, the third return was denied because the store no longer carried it. Called B&D; for warranty questions and to order another part, was told no longer made parts for this model, but send the old one back with a check for shipping and they'd happily send us a new updated model.I highly suggest you consider another."
1,Don't buy this one,"My daughter sent me this for Christmas. I thought it was fantastic until I tried it. I pushed the 9 oz button, got about 4.5 oz of coffee, the machine shut off, and I had water running all over my counter. What a dud. Thinking it was just MY coffee pot, I took it back to Wal-Mart, where she purchased it, and got another one. I could not believe my eyes. The second one did the same darned thing!!! This product needs to be recalled by Black & Decker!! What a waste of money!!"
1,Worst I've ever bought....,"I have had many different machines over the year. I normally use my Saeco Expresso machine daily but thought I'd try this to make fast, easier regular coffee for friends who are not fond of espresso and myself, when I am too lazy to use the Saeco... Boy, was I ever wrong! The coffee was tepid at best and extremely weak. I ccan't wait to return the machine and advise you all to save your time. It's a shame, because I really thought it was a great idea,,,"
5,Great,This is another great album from Oscar Peterson and this shows the diversity of the man and his music arrangements.
3,Smaller than I thought it would be...,"The picture it's self is not bad at all. It was a little smaller than I thought it would be but once I put it in a frame with a matte around it, it looks very nice."
5,Adorable,"My daughter collects this 7"" series of horses by Wild Republic and she loves them. She plays with them, and they hold up very well to play, travel, and general childplay. The color is actually richer than in this photo, and all the horses we have from this line are soft and beautiful."
1,Very boring. Comprehension on it.. very hard!,"This is not a childrens classic! It is boring. At page 26 I was confused. I read it for A/R (accellerated reading) resons. The movie is much better, and reccomend that you watch it instead of reading the book."
5,Timelessly Hilarious,"I have loved this book since I was a kid (in the early and mid sixties). Besides, Susan Perl's drawings are endearing. It's too bad it's not still in print. The jokes are happy and funny and still worth sharing."
1,"Matt Wharton, didgeridoo fan","This album is a complete disappointment. I bought it because I greatly enjoy David Hudson's other albums (Woolunda, Gunyal and Rainbow Serpent). Synthesized new age slop all but erases Hudson's didgeridoo artistry. The claim that the album is as heard on the television series ""Survivor"" is false. The ""evocative melding of didgeridoo and world rhythms"" gives me the feeling of being in an airport bookstore."
4,Surprise Pleasure,I very much enjoyed this music with the unpredictable sounds used. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes something different.
3,not what I am expected,"It is not the same thing as what my school's bookstore is selling. However, it is a good book."
4,A very good idea,My eight year old loves setting up his calendar and scheduling his activities with the picture magnets. His older sister is now asking for one of her own! I wouldn't recommend the smaller pieces for younger children. It would also be nice if the manufacturer offered replacement magnets as some are sure to be misplaced!
5,Who's The Boss is the Best!!,"Am one of the biggest Tony Danza fans ever and this show was one of the main reasons why I love him so much. I got my DVD in perfect condition. Just upset that for some reason they can release all the seasons of some stupid show like Green Acres, but can not release the full run (8 seasons) of this favorite show. Enjoy!!"
5,Why no 2nd through 8th season?,"Who's the Boss was one of the funniest shows in the 1980's. Where is the 2nd through 8th seasons? Who manufacture's the DVD's? A bunch of us want more, so maybe we could all collectively write to SONY or whoever decides to create more Who's the Boss video material. Any suggestions who we can contact?"
5,WHO'S THE BOSS???,"GOOD SHOW,GREAT DVD SET,BUT WHO DO I HAVE TO WRITE TO TO DEMAND THE RELEASE OF SEASON 2 & THE REST OF THE SEASONS OF THIS GREAT SHOW?"
4,DVD review,"I have this DVD. It contains 3 discs. The first 2 discs have 9 episodes each and the third has the last 4 for a total of 22 episodes. Disc 1 also has some ""special features"", but these are more like a ""best of X character"".The picture and sound quality are pretty good. There are even chapters for all the episodes, though no way to directly select them from the menus. You'll need to use your remote. Menus are pretty good too and there is a ""Play all episodes"" option.On a whole, it's pretty good. Extras are pretty much nil, but if you liked the series then you will probably like this set."
4,Why there is no second season: The Answer!!!,"Now first of all I guess this series has alot of fans me included! We all loved to watch this on TV. Now following this series for the past years to be sold on DVD still many people don t know why there isn t a second season!? Well back already in 2004 there was an official statement concerning this TV Show that they didn t sell the first season very well...in fact it sold bad (according to the company issuing this release (First Season)!) Now to my knowledge this is the only TV -Series they didn t continue after they issued the first season, which in fact is just incredible since lovely Alyssa Milano has alot of fans. We can only hope that either another company is getting a copyright or the fans write to the studio who owns the copyright to continue this lovely and charming series. Tons of crap has been issued nowadays and it would be great if someone really gives this series a second chance!"
4,"WHY WON""T THEY RELEASE THE OTHER SEASONS?","Another show I grew up watching and like a lot. What I don't understand is WHY won't they release the other seasons?? It's crazy, I'm sure fans would be so appreciative if they would release the other seasons. I would definitely buy it."
3,"One of the best ""oldies""","Enjoyed every episode. All the actors really seemed natural in their parts. Only negative, but a big one. Out of three discs, Disc Two was ""scrambled"" and unwatchable."
5,Great Healthy Snack,"I keep these in my desk drawer. They are my quick breakfast and snack at any time of day. They taste great, and have nothing but good stuff in them."
5,One tasty bar!,Leave it to the folks behind Kashi to find a delicious way to work flax into our diet. These bars are a great source of protein and fiber. It makes a perfect on the go breakfast (even for weight watchers) and also a kid-friendly snack to take to the swimming pool.
4,natural taste,"These bars are yummy and chewy, but not as ""processed"" tasting as some other bars. They have a natural, raw taste. I like it, but if you're looking for a taste like, say, Quaker chewy granola bars, these are not the same. You can see the variety of whole grains -- much more than just oats. I like them!"
3,super nutty,"ive have tasted many snack bars, and although this one is not bad. it is not my favorite. very nutty, it just like eating a hand full of nuts...i think should be more chewy to it and less nuts.....there good enough to eat, but for me not ordering more"
5,Great book!!!!!!!,"This is a great book, it's easy to read, it has excellent, detalied and graphic photographs. I highly recomend this book as a text or reference book."
2,too specific,"This book is step by step instructions for building the system that the author built. There is no general information, and no engineering data. If you live on Long Island and want a cookbook approach this is a good book. Otherwise it's not so hot."
2,I found this one hard to adjust and not really that comfortable,I never really used this one much because I found the Cliff Keen F5 tornado to be much more comfortable and easier to adjust. My kids also like the F5 better.
5,wrestling headgear,"The headgear came in and was great. It was the right color, right fit, and great quality. I would order again"
4,Bartender Tote Set,"Quality is OK for the price. However - the long spoon does not fit into the tote bag, even if you fit it sideways. The tote bag is pretty cheap, so I am getting another one that will fit the spoon and may add more items to the set. A lid for the shaker would be nice. I didn't notice that when I ordered it. You can turn the cup upside down and shove it in there, but a lid would have been better. All in all, you get what you pay for and this is a cheap set that will work when you don't want to take your nice things to a tail-gate, or off-site party."
5,Job well done,This is one of the best albums of 2005 I have to say. It gives rock-pop a good name. I would recommend this album to anybody whos a fan of pop-rock!
3,Very Good,"The opening 3 tracks of Andrew McMahon's solo project are so incredible, it's almost a shame to rate the album anything lower than a 5. Sadly, 'Everything In Transit' can't sustain the sheer greatness of the initial ten minutes for 11 tracks. The remaining half hour of music is good, but one can't help but wonder what could have been if every track was of the same quality as ""Bruised.""Standout tracks: Holiday From Real, The Mixed Tape, Bruised"
5,best album of the year,This is easily the best album of the year. Some of the best lyrics of hear in a while. It just makes your really think about life. 5 stars!
5,A Must Buy,"This cd is awesome. I read about this album in a recent article in Entertainment Weekly- and I doubt I would have come across it if I haven't. This is one of those Cds that gets better each time you listen to it. The lyrics are just amazing.My favorites of the album are:1. Holiday From Real2. Mixed Tape10. Rescued (the first half of this song is good- but I love the upperbeat of the second half). Anyways, go out and buy this album, it is great!"
5,amazing doesn't cut it,"There is something to be said about the prolific, creative, and talented song writer, Andrew McMahon. He is truly amazing, and that word doesn't even cut it. This album is one of the best album's I have heard in a long time. From happy melodies, to deep and dark songs, this album can describe for you, every emotion that you have ever encountered- especially during a busy and hectic work week. The charming jingles and catchy phrases of some of his songs, including ""dark blue"" will leave you breathless and gasping for more at the end of each four minute ballad. Anyone who has ever loved life, and has loved love this album is for you."
5,Lauren,The best music I have ever heard other than Something Corporate! It is truly appreciated by those whom appreciate good music and enjoy lyrics that actually mean something. Piano Rock is the future and I hope that all who read this go out and buy Everything In Transit!
5,amazing cd,"If you enjoy listening to Something Corporate, you are bound to enjoy Jack's Mannequin's ""Everything In Transit."" Andrew McMahon's enchanting voice and impressive lyrics make this album the outstanding record that it is."
5,Everything in Transit,"Jack's Mannequin is the greatest and it's a shame that few people know about them. I love this albulm because the songs are fantastic. Jack's Mannequin is one of the best artists in the music industry. They even contricute to cancer reasearch, especial pediatrics!"
5,unbelievable,"words cannot describe how incredible this CD is,,, amazing talent across the board,, I have found what i have been looking for ,,,, get it !!!! I know good music trust me,,,,,,, WOW"
3,yea,Lead singer diagnosed with cancer after finishing the last song on this record.he fought and won the battle of cancer.I LOVE SOMETHING CORPORATE and the least i can do i buy this album.not bad at all!! i rate this based on the other albums they made so its not a 5 but definatly not bad.
5,The best CD I ever bought.,"This CD was simply amazing. I got it when it first came out, and it still plays over and over again on my CD player...I am absolutely head over heels in love with Jack's Mannequin and even more now with Andrew McMahon's voice. For fans of Something Corporate, this really is a must have. For people who've never heard of SC or Jack's, then you really really must give this a try. You won't regret buying this CD because it's so stunning. The music is just indescribable...I love it, and everyone who buys it will too!"
5,Everything In Transit,"This is an amazing cd. When I first heard the single ""The Mixed Tape"" I knew it was a must have. In fact that night I rushed out to the store and bought it even though I had only heard one song. It is definitely one of my favorite cds. I listen to on a daily basis. I find it perfect for almost any mood I'm in. I recommend it to anyone and everyone."
5,amazing cd!,"this is an amazing cd. i'd recomend it to anyone! andrew mcmahon has an amazing voice, and his music is very compelling. i cant say enough how much i've enjoyed this cd!"
5,Jack's Mannequin,"in my opinion, this is in many ways different from something corporate. it shows a lot of growth from ""leaving through the window"", and is more upbeat than ""north"". the vocals are fantastic and the band is really great. this album is a perfect addition to any something corporate fan's collection."
4,Jack's Mannequin is a MUST BUY!,"This is a wonderful album with beautiful vocals. Andrew shows that he could truly shine as a musician in both Something Corporate and Jack's Mannequin. In my opinion, this was very different from a SoCo record. The music and art work or the album shows how different of a person Andrew has become when it comes to songwriting. He has grown as a writer and continues to write wonderfully. It has many strong points and continues to capture many hearts and new fans. This is a must buy!"
2,Something missing...,"I am pretty nearly constantly listening to music all the time. And it is a variety of years and genres - the only thing I don't listen to is death metal.There just seemed to be something missing on this album. Not that the music was not ""good"" but it sort of seems that the band has a bit more of developing (of their sound, lyrics especially) to do.Like I said, it isn't that it wasn't a decent album, but I look forward to hearing their next album to find out if they have developed themselves a bit more."
1,Blah,"This one is a yawn and a half. andrew, please go back to SoCo and leave cheesy beach-boy pop for that awful ""cute is what we aim for"" band. Where's the heartfelt emo ballads? The breakneck pop-punk tracks? The straight-ahead rockers? Not here. I end up gettin a headache everytime i try and let Everything In Transit grow on me. If you're into pop-punk/emo/rock...then pass. Garbage."
5,Jack's Mannequin,"This is by far my favorite CD in my collection. I'm amazed by all the songs on this album, and I can't pick a favorite, but trust me - this CD is worth every cent! I look forward to more Jack's Mannequin songs and albums in the future.~Messenger themixedt4pe."
5,listening perfection,"This cd combines raw, emotional lyrics and catchy, yet finely done, music. Each song provides a new listening experience, which flow with emotion. The songs will get stuck in your head for days."
5,favorite cd of the summer,"Andrew McMahon is an extremely talented guy--Something Corporate was the first band that I could actually call my favorite, so maybe this review is a little biased, but honestly, if you're a SoCo fan, you'd definitely be a JM fan. The CD really blew me away before I even finished listening to the first couple songs. Usually, I'm one to criticise lyrics and even vocals, but I've found that I can never really criticise anything to do with Andrew McMahon. The lyrics are meaningful and catchy, and his voice just makes everything sound smooth...My favorite tracks are probably Dark Blue and MFEO, but that'll probably change in a few days. It's a really great CD, and it belongs in your possession if you're at all a fan of piano-rock."
5,GREAT!,"One of the BEST CDs I have ever listened to! If you like Something Corporate then you will LOVE this CD. Its great, well worth the money."
5,brilliant album,"""everything in transit"" by jack's mannequin is one of the best albums i have heard all year. the album released aug. 23rd was a splash of refreshing water in this summer's drought of dry music releases. album highlights include the albums first single, 'the mixed tape,' and more upbeat yet emotional rollercoasting tracks such as 'buised' and 'dark blue.' there is also two more tracks from this timeless artist available only on itunes. the first of which is a track no doubt cut from the album named 'lonely for her,' and a newly released christmas song, a first for andrew mcmahon, named 'the lights and buzz.' this song captures mcmahon in his relaxed californian home, after a real life struggle with cancer. i highly recommend you buy this all of jack's mannequin's work."
1,Looks (photos) are deceiving,The photos of this item make it look like it's constructed of silvery aluminum - appearing sturdy and rigid. Well...its 1/8th inch thick gray plastic and pretty pliable. I doubt that it would survive a 3 foot fall on its corner. Above and beyond that disappointment was the fact that mine arrived with all the assembly hardware missing. Not a bolt or washer in sight - just 4 sad pieces of plastic and a piece of plywood.. Avoid this item...clearly not worth the money and the headache.
5,A complete detailed theoritical and analytical book,"An excellent work both theory and analysis. Provides an insight about the math requirments for the Marketing Researcher. In certain areas it gives the basic ideas - pp 752,753 - Fig.13.1 Histogram and Frequency Polygon of Incomes of Families in Car Ownership study. The Preface states- this edition, is designed to avoid such extremes by providing the student with a thorough treatment of the important concepts, both simple and complex - This aspect is proved in every section of the book. Really it will help the student to develop their creativie and analytical marketing skills. A very good work."
2,Got a used book in bad shape!,"I purchased this book paying $117.66. The book did reach in 4-5 days. But, the book was full of markings and highlightings. I expected a book with much less wear and tear when I pay this much. I did get better books from other book sellers for much less in the past, which made me unhappy with the present purchase."
2,Crickets make better music,"Danny Thomas, check. Marlo Thomas, check. Roddy McDowall, double check. Then why oh why is this cartoon disturbing?? OH, because real crickets make better music than the soundtrack. Usually when Im on the home computer with a tv show in the background to keep me company, it usually keeps my mind preoccupied and motivated. With this one I wanted to throw a rock at the tv, the music is horrible and even the female cat scratches a wretched note. The main tune is a long dreary song bent on pure sentiment. Awful. Give me ""Holly Jolly Christmas"" any day. The Cricket On The Hearth remains a story better left before bedtime from a quiet book. Parents please note."
2,Cricket on the Hearth Misses Mark,"Cricket on the Hearth misses the mark by today's standards. It may have been fine in its day; however by today's standards it does not hold children's attention. The plot is predictable, the music and story dull.My grandchildren were bored after 3 minutes.When you compare this to today's animated Christmas stories, or especially to the 1968 restored version of ""The Night Before Christmas"", the production misses the mark! This proves the old adage, you really can't go home again!"
2,CC ON DVD DOESN'T WORK,"I BOUGHT THIS DVD VERSION OF A VHS THAT I ALREADY HAVE BECAUSE IT STATED THAT IT HAS CLOSED CAPTION. WHEN I GOT IT HOME IT DID PLAY BUT IT DID NOT HAVE CLOSED CAPTION. I TRIED THE DVD ON 4 DIFFERENT DVD PLAYERS AND IT NEVER WORKED. IF YOU DON'T NEED CLOSED CAPTION, THEN IT'S FINE. BUT IF YOU NEED IT, THEN IT'S NOT WHAT YOU NEED. STICK TO THE VHS."
5,Satisfied customer,That was a very good deal. The book was real clean and look like new. I am happy that I purchased it second hand and save. Great book to have.
2,Wouldn't recommend,Bought this hoping to test my pH levels - but in further research on internet found that this it not really an accurate method for doing such - live and learn.
5,PH test tape,Great product and easy to use. Think a little expensive for such a small package. Product worked really well and just as advertised. Used today 2/26/13 A.M. as described and worked instantly. Will buy again when need.
3,Acceptable product and acceptable service.,"The product came as expected. It came in a timely manner and it included 2 that I had ordered. No complaints. It wasn't a great price compared to stores, but I agreed to it and both parties got what they agreed to."
3,mixed feelings,"Put in a sharp auger bit and drill holes in the joists, and everything is nice and easy. The key chuck is a little awkward though. Accidentaly touch the large paddle switch while changing the bit, and then start looking for the nearest hospital. I have worked as a builder for decades, and have used just about every power tool on the market. This is the first time I have ever been harmed by one. This is a flawed design, the tool should have a safety switch. Beware."
4,"Lots of power, fits in tight spaces","Great right angle drill. The built in light is nice. Power control is a bit touchy, a clutch would be a great addition. Overall, a tough, reliable tool."
5,Quality all the way,"This tool has so much torque at low speeds and control of rpm using the rotating locking switch that it is absolutely in a class by itself. Worked with some brass screws in tight corners in hard maple, and found out that no other power tool could do what this did, and so delicatly, no stripped screw heads.Control was so consistent and torque so reliable."
4,Green lantern costume,"Compared to other costumes with the built in muscles, this one is more plan. There are no extras such as capes, mask, etc. The size runs large and long, so if your child is little, I would recommend going down a size. Thin material, but overall seems to stand up to everyday wearing, which is the case at our house with a 4 year old."
2,Challenging listen,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found Early Man challenging to listen to. The last time I nearly turned it off several times when the energy got too dissonant, too heavy, too uncomfortable, but each time it eventually shifted into beautiful deep stuff.I love Steve Roach, but this may be one of my *least* favorite things he's done."
2,Not what I expected,"This program contains good advice, but most of it is nothing new. A couple of things bother me. First, it's difficult to determine exactly what the sacred truths are. They are not highlighted very effectively, so after listening to the book you will not be able to list them. Maybe it's just me, but I like when ideas are presented in a clear, logical manner. Here they are not. The other problem with the book is the background music that plays almost continuously while the people are talking. It was very distracting. I was listening to "" The seven Habits of Highly Effective People"" before listening to ""The Seven Sacred Truths."" Stephen Covey's book is light years beyond this one in presentation and practical value."
3,Decent Buy,"CD Includes:(1)It's Been Awhile(Clean Version)(2)Suffocate(3)It's Been Awhile(Album Version)(4)It's Been Awhile(CD-Rom Video)1+3 Taken From The Album ""Break The Cycle""(Clean/Explicit),2 Taken From ""Dysfuntion"".4 Exclusive To This CD."
3,"I really like the song ""It's Been Awhile"" the most.","I love the video and song, the first time I saw it while working out at my gym. I'm not a rock fan, but I really liked the lead singer in this song. I like it so much in fact, I intend to buy it."
2,JUST FOR INFORMATION,"THIS GAME HAS GREAT GRAPHICS AND GREAT GAME PLAY. THE ONLY DOWN SIDE IS THAT THE ENDING IS CHEESY, AND THE BOSSES ARE TO EASY TO BEAT. THIS GAME IS ONLY A PART ONE, SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO WAIT UNTIL PART TWO COMES OUT TO PLAY THIS."
4,Much better than the Playstation Version,"If you liked Soul Reaver on the Playstation, then you will definitely like it on the Dreamcast. Enhanced graphics, faster gameplay, and new gameplay elements make this a great game. For those who aren't familiar with Soul Reaver, take Tomb Raider and put a darker edge on it."
5,Don't forget to come up for air,"This is a fantastic game that you can easily spend hour after hour on without even realizing it until your eyes are all dried out and your thumbs hurt.The graphics are incredible and the movies are a little long but very entertaining.Its fun to find someplace you can't quite reach and find out later that with a new ""power' that place is now accessible.The only downside I could find is that the game is a little heavy in the ""finding the trick"" puzzle solving."
5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,I have nothing but good things to say about this game. Its by far one of the greatest games I've ever played. The worlds are huge and they look incredible. The game play is uncomparable to anything else out there. There are loads of tricky puzzles to figure out. The story is amazing. The sound is great. Fighting and destroying your enemies has never been so intense. You'll find yourself looking foward to getting time alone so you can play it. THIS GAME IS A MUST BUY. TAKE MY WORD FOR IT...........
5,Eidos' finest hour emerges from its...darkest?,"Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver has made a remarkable jump to the Sega Dreamcast, packing incredible visuals with a deep, dark world of action to discover. Some of the visuals will shock you with their darkening beauty, while others will help provide some clues to your task. The voice samples remain top notch and the story keeps you hanging, even if the ending is a bit of a letdown. It's the journey, not the destination, and Soul Reaver offers a dark but extraordinary journey."
3,Great looking but. . .,"Yeah it looks incredible, the voice acting really sets the standard for all other games and the camera angles are tolerable (which is good for this type of game) but. . .How often can you move block, flip switch, repeat. . . before you get tired of playing? Plus, the levels are designed such that you're forced to do A LOT of backtracking, which adds to the ""size"" of the game without adding to the real size of the game.Love or even like Tomb Raider? Get this game.Tired of blocks and swithches? Avoid this game because great graphics do not a game make."
2,Lesbian Vampire Comments,"Not enough quality skin. And, not ""Halloween Worthy"" enough. I would not recommend this video. I was hoping it could be shown at our annual halloween party, but it's not going to make the cut."
1,NOT RECEIVED,This is more a seller review. I am extremely disappointed. I purchased the item and I was charged for it 1 month ago and I still didn't receive it.
1,Unhappy,"I have email the owner of this product to no success. I made it clear that I want ""Indiscretion of an American Wife"" by Anne Archer not Jennifer Jones. If the person did not have that one, then he/she should have said so. He was trying to make a profit. Not a good movie by Jennifer. I would rather have the one by Anne Archer.Unhappy customer!!!!"
2,Not Jones and Clift's greatest,"I eagerly anticipated this movie because I am a fan of both Jennifer Jones and Montgomery Clift. However, I was sorely disappointed because of its snails pace and poor plotting. Definitely a time wasting bore."
2,Two great stars but not worth the time.,As a fan of both Jones and Clift I was hoping for a hidden treasure here. This short [63 minutes] Italian production seems more like a movie missing its first hour. Both stars give it their best effort but its basically a mess.
1,THE SELZNICK HOLLYWOODSAW CUT MASSACRE,"Well, firstly I think people should be aware that the european version of Vittorio de Sica's INDISCRETION OF AN AMERICAN WIFE is 120 minutes long and that the U.S. release presented here by The Roan Group lasts...63 minutes. The hour long neo-realistic scenes shot by the italian director had been cut by a David Selznick fearing that the american audience could be shocked by the 1953 italian reality. The Dream Factory couldn't accept a movie that would have awakened the nice sleepers of America.So, what's left of the movie is watchable, nothing more. Jennifer and Montgomery spend a lot of time running through Rome Main Station and cruise a few symbolical figures that have lost all their impact.So let's hope that the european version will appear soon in the Criterion catalogue. Just production notes as bonus feature. No more than average sound and images.A DVD for the garbage can."
5,Holy cards...note cards...,Very nice quality cards and envelopes. 15 note cards; 15 different images; 16 envelopes. Drawer box very sturdy and beautiful.
3,A bit dry for my taste,"I enjoyed the book on a whole and loved the plot ideas in its entirety, but the book progressed a little slowly for my taste, and didn't focus on one main plot line, but rather, several subplots within a larger plot. And although this may sound confusing, it was very easy to comprehend. In general, very good, just not to my taste."
2,A dissenting opinion,"Has the episodic feel of something that was serialized originally. I didn't really get to the point of ""caring"" about any of the characters--and some of the most interesting were either minor or were antagonists. Even the interesting ones were far from three-dimensional. It's OK if you want to read a dated attempt to treat parapsychic phenomena--but there's better treatments out there."
3,This is not PERN,"When most people think of Anne McCaffrey they think of her famous PERN series. This book and the others follow are a separate series (TO RIDE PEGASUS, PEGASUS IN FLIGHT AND PEGASUS IN SPACE).The basic premise of this series is that many people posses psychic abilities ""Talents"" that they often hide in an effort to fit in with society. A small group of these Talented people band together, beginning a world wide organization of similarly gifted people that leads to a society divided into those who possess Talents and those who are envious and wary of them. This opening book of the series is really four short stories that McCaffrey wrote early in her career (the first published in 1969). Like many early works this one lacks the polish and charm of later works.I would recommend this only to those who are fans of other books in the PEGASUS or ROWAN series."
1,HORRIBLE E-book Edition,"Sorry this review isn't about the book but about the condition of the Kindle edition. This e-book is full of misspellings, words run-together, missing punctuation, wrong words and is generally unreadable. Of course there is no recourse for a bad Kindle edition so I feel like Amazon has taken my money and cheated me. AVOID!"
2,A good read spoiled by bad transcription,"I have the Talent series in hardcover but now that ""Pegasus In Flight"" is available for the Kindle, I've added the beginning ""Pegasus"" trilogy to mine. But the spelling mistakes and missing punctuation in ""To Ride Pegasus"" are ruining the read for me. Periods are constantly being left out and you find yourself reading sentences that make little sense - but if you look again, you'll see a capitalized word which, if you were to put a period before it, would make two sentences that make more sense. Spelling like: `Aftar an Daffyd and others...' (instead of: After all Daffyd and others); `A winged hone' (for: A winged horse); `That's what I can Vaden' (for: That's what I call Vaden) are often interfering with the flow of the book."
1,Kindle version,"So many typos in the Kindle copy, you spend more time translating than actually reading this version. I have owned the hard copy of this book for years and have read it dozens of times but had to stop this time about 10 pages in because whoever at Kindle proofed the copy needs to be fired for gross incompetence. Ended up returning for a refund and will stick to my paperback for this one."
2,Sugar Bomb,"This candy tasted like sugar without much rose flavor at all.I ended up throwing most of it out because I don't like so much sugar.... I prefer strong flavors likeAltoids Twin Pack Mints, Wintergreen 2 tinsThe center of the candy does have a licorice flavor because it's an anise seed. But there are better licorice candies out there likeTwizzlers Twists, Black Licorice, 1-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)."
4,Dance Music for Beatniks,"First, a few words of explanation. Please note that ""Bossa Per Due"" and ""Jet Sounds"" are essentially the same album. ""Bossa"" is the American release, ""Jet Sounds"" the European. Secondly, you are probably here because you heard one of these tracks on a TV commercial. ""Bossa Per Due"" (the song) was used in an Acura commercial about a year ago, and ""Jet Sounds"" (the song) is currently used in the Joe Boxer commercial where the African-American fellow is dancing in his underwear.As for the music itself, Conte fits into an obscure but trendy genre that combines 60s lounge and bossa nova music with modern dance/techno elements. The result is a weird (but often enjoyable) hybrid of retro and ultra-contemporary. Whether you like it or not, you've probably never heard anything quite like it."
1,Samba Nervosa?,"OK, there's two good cuts but unfortunatly some Madison Avenue ad exec co-opted the best one to peddle a Japanese car. I thought Brazil was famous for musicians, not DJ's."
3,dissappointment,I guessed it to be like Saint Privat's Riviera but I am dissapointed when I listened this cd. Gave a second chance but not changed my mind.
2,Oops,"These are nice sheets, but do not buy for Graco Travel Bassinet/Crib. Too small for mattress. The mattress does lay flat. It would be nice if the company would describe what cribs it fits in."
3,disappointing,"American Water is a terrific record so I was really looking forward to this release. Sadly it can't match AW's variety, originality, mystery, and great guitar work, being rather a return to the limp mopiness of The Natural Bridge (even so, NB is a better record). Seems like DC Berman needs Steven Malkmus to make it happen."
2,When does the new album come out???,"Is it just me or does Bright Flight sound like a b-sides singles album? When does the new Silver Jews album come out? Well whenever it does, I hope its better than this!!"
1,Heinlein wrote many better than this,"I literally picked up a copy of this book because I was stranded on a tropical island and it was one of the few available in English. As such, I must admit reading it was more enjoyable than counting grains of sand or staring at my toes. Higher praise than that I am unable to dispense. I am an occasional Heinlein enthusiast (loved The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Stranger in a Strange Land but detested The Cat Who Walked Through Walls and The Number of the Beast) and this book seemed to distill all of the very worst of Heinlein's writing (a two dimensional, unbelievable hero, a sexist view of women etc.) Perhaps I am just too old to enjoy Starman Jones but I suspect that most adolescents are a lot smarter than this book is."
3,"Yes, but then, not Quite","Though often compared to Palmer, Meier fades in comparison to the exquisite linguistic, and often haunting, beauty that Michael Palmer has wrought. Maybe my slight disappointment with this book is its youth. Meir relies on a kind of distanced irony that grows a bit ... expected? A voice common among his generation, particularly with the other writers on the Verse list. Perhaps none of this is fair, there are many fine moments in here. But let Meier find more emotional texture and variance as time passes to make less obvious his linguistic shifts."
3,Government Sunglasses,"Once the initial excitement of getting a package in the mail wears off, you are left feeling a little let down after opening your new sunglasses. While getting a pair of 1974 dated military issue sunglasses is cool, the sunglasses themselves are a little something to be desired.First of all, they smell. Maybe its being packaged for thirty some years or maybe its the plastic. But these smell like dog butt.Second, the hard plastic frames are WAY bent out of shape and can't easily be bent back.I tried to use my fingers like the packaging stated, but I ended up having to use a pair of pliers to bend the frames so they actually fit on my head.Thrid, the nose pieces are non-adjustable. I can't wear these at all without them slipping down to the end of my nose. They don't have little soft plastic pieces but hard plastic that can not be shaped at all."
3,Ok CD,"I'm 16 and i loved Jimmy neutron but I am not a fan of pop at all but there were some songs that made up for all the other stuff including: We got the beat, The jimmy neutron theme (gotta love it) and Blitzkreig Bop. Even though they are only 3 songs that i like its ok. but what did I expect of course they will have Aaron carter and the backstreet boys but oh well. My fav though is deffinitly the Jimmy Neutron theme."
4,AWESOME!,"I TOTALLY FOGOT ABOUT THIS SONGS FROM THIS MOVIE. SINCE I BOUGHT IT, LISTENED, AND GIVES ME A GREAT MEMORY WHAT I REMEMBER AND I WON'T FORGET THIS MUSIC."
4,Jimmy Neutron Movie soundtrack,It's pretty good. Has alot of music my nephews like. Even has some that I enjoy being an older person.
2,a side note,"In addition, as a sort of a P.S., the original Kids in America was sung by Kim Wilde, and this I acknowledged, but I like the Muff's version a lot more. I know that the Muff's did not originally do that song, but it was a good version. Kim Wilde's is also fantastic, as it is the original."
2,Doesn't Pass the Test of Time,"After listening again to it after all this time, there's only one thing that stands up (except for the original Ramones and Go Go's stuff). Check out the Bowling for Soup theme song. This group is tight with excellent harmonies. Check out their new album with the hit ""1985""."
5,King of All Kids' Records,"I recieved this as a Christmas gift and it was totally cool! My favorite song on the album has got to be ''Jimmy Neutron'' by Bowling for Soup. I also enjoyed the movie, which I hope will soon be released on VHS and DVD. Only disadvantage is I'VE LOST THE CD!!!!!!!!"
3,Hard to fold,This works great for us at home becuase we can just strap it to a chair and it doesn't take up a lot of room. We can also move it around the house with us easier. It is not very easy to fold up. This is not a great seat if you want to take it with you all the time. It's very hard to move up and down and there is no place to store the tray. Works great at home but not good if you want it for on the go travel.
5,Intimate moldies,"As Christmas music goes, this may not be a runaway standout but it's Christmas to me. Often times, I find that adaptations of old songs are either annoying replicas of the original or far-out, unrecognizable pieces, which may be fine on their own, but end up being distracting because you expected something that at least reminded you of the original. Tom Barabas successfully avoids these all too common pitfalls to create sometimes lilting, sometimes haunting, but always beautiful melodies that can either stand as a backdrop for a Christmas party or be the focus of a quiet night alone. There's enough variation to feel like you're getting a creation and enough adherence to the originals to feel like Christmas.The original songs are a matter of preference, and are much more introspective and intimate, but eventually have become part of my Christmas over the years. This album is the perfect way to unwind after a long pre-Christmas day or to set a pleasant, soothing mood. Get it."
1,Awful mug.,"This has got to be one of the worst mugs I've ever used. First, they need to take the ""travel"" portion out of the name of this product. Here is my list of why this ""travel"" mug is better left at home:1) It has no rubber gasket, so there is not a seal of any kind. I hadn't even pulled out of my driveway before I had spilled coffee all on the inside of my car.2) Because there is not a good seal, by the time I got to work, what hadn't spilled out was cold. I had to reheat my coffee 3 times over a 1-hour period just to keep it warm.Don't waste your money. Great in theory, massive fail."
1,Not What it's Cracked Up to Be,"""Cracked"" is the correct word here. I've purchase two of these mugs. The first arrived in an undamaged box cracked badly from the rim down past the handle. When I went to send it back I was hoping for an exchange - nope - that wasn't an option (I'm guessing because the package wasn't damaged), so I ordered another one. The second mug arrived in an undamaged box with exactly the same issue, only this time the crack was slightly more fine.I won't be buying another one. Either the stock needs to be inspected much more closely or they need to bump up the amount of packing materials they use - I don't know when the breakage is occurring, but it it's happening before I get it.Very disappointed."
5,nice cup,I didn't expect the lid to fit as well as it did. a coworker of mine has a similar cup and I wanted one to use at work for heating up water in the microwave.
3,"Excellent customer service, does NOT cut 16 ga","I purchased this cutter for my home shop. And it cuts 22 ga metal great, very smooth and easy. However, it did not cut 16 ga sheet metal as advertised. The wheel became stuck and my helper was cut in the process of trying to remove the 16 ga sheet metal from the cutter. I opened up the cutter and there was a pin that was suppose to hold the lever to the wheel, it must have been made of some soft steel because it was not strong enough to handle the amount of pressure.However, this was my first return on an item from Grizzly and it was fairly easy. So 5 stars for customer service, and 1 star for the cutter."
3,Not as bad as a 1...not as good as a 5,"This game was ok...if a game really sucks I tend to not make it through it...anyway, once you get a hang of the engine, it's really not bad. Lot's of interesting quests and items. Not much online help, though...It's also night all the time (with no explanation) and that is a bit annoying, plus you need to read the online sites that ARE available because there are a couple of bugs that'll getcha...other than that I liked it."
1,"so bad, i threw it away, almost unplayable, no direction","little fun, cheesy graphics. The beginning gets you excited, the music is nice, ok, but it seems repetitive, the orc monsters unimaginative, and you just walk quickly down roads in the snow hoping to find an apple before you starve, which happens all-to-soon. Boring. Most of the time you just try to figure out what to do, what you can do, which is not much, or you wish you would be told what you should do. Save your cash. I put mine in the trash.Apparently, at the beginning, you have to pay the ferryman when given a choice. I figured out that much. Very disapponting."
2,Not Murder Rock,Murder RockNote the reviews here are misleading. Slashdance is NOT the same movie as Fulci's Murder Rock.
2,Not as helpful as I would have liked,"This book isn't helpful to a beginning grad student trying to get a better grasp on solid state. Maybe someone a little more advanced, like a postdoc or very advanced grad student, would benefit from this book.The questions in each topic area start with a very basic question (for which there is a limited solution) and then skip right to much more difficult questions (for which there are still limited worked-out solutions). I have not found the book helpful, and I'm a 2nd year grad student w/a strong math background. I think it tries to cover too much in too little space, rather than (what I need) focusing on the basics (at a graduate level) and expanding a little on the main topics.Basically, it's going to end up being a waste of my money."
2,Standard Problems Presented in a Mediocre Fashion,"This book offers a nice set of pretty standard undergraduate to first year graduate problems in solid state physics. The answers, unfortunately, are sloppy and remarkably lack the detail you would expect from a question and answer book. Each chapter has a superficial and not too insightful introduction to the topic before asking the questions. Probably, most disappointing are the problems for which there are no answers. Isn't this supposed to be a problem and answer book? If you are looking for an insightful solution guide or a general overview as a companion for an introductory solid state course, you don't want this book. If you just want to see a result and have some stuff to jot down on homework assignments, then perhaps this book is just what you need."
1,awful,This thing gobbles AA's at a phenomenal rate. Duracells and Energizers. Don't buy this mouse unless you have a huge stockpile of batteries at your disposal.
3,Hard to Improve on the Original---Even For the Original,"Live at the Paramount by The Guess Who can't be improved upon, even though this is a valiant effort. After 30 years of enjoying the original, I don't begrudge buying this but it sure is missing the reckless abandon of youth that makes Live at the Paramount a rock classic and a definite must-have. The modern production of burying the vocals is the exact opposite of the original and the electric piano,compared to the original, is bunk. Buy Live at the Paramount and Running Back Through Canada will really make you appreciate the original live classic even more. No one can sing like 1972's Burton Cummings but you've got to give 2002's Burton credit for giving us his best effort. Young and good beats old and good in boxing...and rock. Sigh."
2,For competists only,"This 2-CD set is or die-hard completists only.It's nice to see the group back together,and this set is undoubtedly a good souvenir if you were at one of these shows.The group's playing ablity is intact,and these mid to late 50-ish musicians gave their audience a satisfactory evening of entertainment,but the 4-pack a day smoking of which lead singer/pianist Burton Cummings once boasted has taken its' toll.His voice is fried to a crisp,and almost unrecognizably different from the voice on the old 1968-76 RCA albums.His voice is now whiny and constricted in the upper part of his range.Stick with one of RCA's hits packages,and hear the group in its'heyday."
2,went to concerts,"musicianship excellent. voice, for burt at least, is gone. to bad because it was great. man that guy could sing, anyone who has ever heard ""humpty's blues"" knows what i mean. oh well, you had a good run. everyone gets old. maybe pure jazz or some other redirection of material(think brian eno). ya still got that wheatfield soul. can't lose that.just don't try to sing what you can't anymore. hey, you're lucky, most of the rest of us never could."
4,Good Reading,"Well, Sharon autobiography is a must read to get some grasp of the ME conflict.He participated in the 1967 war (The Six Days war), the 1973 war (The Youm Kippor war), the invasion of Lebanon and rose in the political ladder to be a PM. I'm not a fan of the guy (I'm an Egyptian), but the book is worth reading."
1,Would the real Coco & the Bean stand up?,"I really do not have the words to describe how disappointed I am with this CD. One would be better served to listen to all of their singles, Western ways, Killing time. In addition, to the cuts they put on the 'Blunted' CD, waisters and melted.I was big time disappointed. If you love milky tracks with jazzy 1920's hook-lines reminiscent of Sarah Vaughn or billy holiday lamenting over love while lazily tripping into the sunset, this CD ain't it!A big disappoint. This CD is straight commercial. The distinctively emotional vocals and creamy medleys are missing. Would the real coco and the bean stand up"
1,Vanity Published but Masquerading as Decent Literature,"Wow. I don't even know what to say. I just spent an hour of my life reading this book, and I want it back.It reads like a synopsis, with no discernible scenes, little dialogue, poor style and punctuation. It's unpublishable material that probably wouldn't have seen the light of day in the hands of a capable publisher such as Random House or Penguin. (The folks who published this book will publish anyone.) Have a look inside and see for yourself.If the subject matter interests you, try reading a work by someone who actually knows how to write: White Oleander and Ellen Foster are pretty good."
1,Ice melts quickly,"Someone who's never had a better ice bucket may like this, but compared to my other foam type bucket, the ice lasts about half as long, I don't know why. It may be the hard plastic lid on the hard plastic base that doesnt provide enough of a seal, or could just be the inefficiency of a hollow plastic surround without insulation inside."
2,Handle Comes Loose,"Reasonable holding capacity for an inexpensive bucket. Ice stays solid for a reasonable amount of time. But, and this is a big butt. How many times have I played 52 pick-up because the handle came loose when someone attempted to pick-up the ice bucket by the handle! TNTC"
1,This is not official!,"This is from the band them selfs""A box set has been released that is NOTHING to do with Cradle of Filth. Its not official & was never approved by the band. PLEASE support the band by buying OFFICIAL merchandise & not bootlegs or such like. Its not worth it & its very rare that a band supports unofficial pressings.""Do not buy this!!!!"
2,Picture small,I got the picture in the mail and the paper was 11x14 but the pic was only about 4x5. It just had a lot of white trim around it.
5,User Friendly Book to Spark Your Hidden Desires,This book is such a wonderful tool for a writer with dreams of publication. You feel very comfortable with the editor as she grabs you right from the start with a candid and honest approach. It is extremely user friendly and well written. It is everything it promises to be and I intend to purchase future volumes.
5,Review of Novel & Short Story Writers Market 2006,This book is invaluable to me as a writer; the many well-researched markets open up doors for me to send my writings; I've never found anything not to be true in this handbook. I'd urge all writers and would-be writers to purchase this valuable guide.
3,Not enough rain,"""Soft rain falls in the deep forest. Distant thunder merges with the call of the spotted owl and songs of a myriad of lifeforms....."" That's according to the cover. I immediately thought of the Hoh rain forest, in northwest Washington. This is going to be good. Unfortunately the cd didn't get the memo. There is an opening shower, so low that it's unnoticeable. Other ambient sounds are also quite low. Most ambient sounds are interspersed between tracks, although there is some overlap. The music is what I'd expect from Dean Evanson---lush, varied and melodic. If I rated only the music, I could easily give this cd a 4+, but since I was wanting, and expecting, much more rain, I can only give it a 3."
2,"Stupid Heroine, if u can call her that","Reading about stupid women who deliberately withhold information (or wait for the 'right time', which incidentally never arrives before someone finds out) and choose to misunderstand words is no longer amusing anymore. It is annoying and stupid. Just because u choose to misunderstand words and act abrasively doesn't mean u have a spine - it means you're stupid and childish.That's all. This book really rubbed me the wrong way - sure it's well written and all, but really, this idiocy is getting too much (i guess i have just read one to many books with idiots masquerading as heroines with a backbone)."
5,Very nice cd,It gets the heart pumping and the feet moving. I love Latin music. It's feel good music that you can't help but move your body to.
3,"Good, but not great","I was a big fan of the Go-Betweens from back in the late '80s. The new ""Oceans Apart"" is a pretty strong recording, with some thoughtful lyrics and a few good tunes, but I found it a little disappointing. It doesn't have the same bounce and enthusiastic rhythm of the band's old material, but it's still worth a purchase for those of you who like the 'tweens."
3,if you like Here Comes a City you still may not like this record,I bought this record after hearing the song Here Comes a City on the radio several times. I dug it because it had kind of a weird feeling that reminded me of the talking heads.I had never listened to this band before.. and I think maybe I should have before I bought Oceans Apart. It's a pretty good record but really not what I was expecting. Not nearly as good as Here Comes A City would have led me to believe.
4,A pretty good album,"I had not heard of The Go-Betweens before this album, but now I'm glad that I got it. It's a very good album, overall. I really liked 'Darlinghurst Nights', Lavender and 'Born To A family' not to say the other cuts on the album weren't all that good.... there was a depth to the lyrics of the songs, not mindless pop. Great to listen to. 'No Reason To Cry' and 'Here Comes a City' are other good tracks on this album."
3,A masterpiece of songwriting ruined by senseless CD mastering,"No question, this is the Go-Betweens best or perhaps second best album (after 16 LOVERS LANE or LIBERTY BELLE), with stellar song after song. Unfortunately, the CD is mastered far too loud, with noticeable distortion(!) blanketing quieter tracks like ""This Night's For You"". Was the mastering engineer asleep at the switch? (This problem afflicts both the US Yep-Roc and UK Lo-Max releases).As a result, I find myself listening to THAT STRIPED SUNLIGHT SOUND (recorded on the tour promoting OCEANS APART) far more often, but maybe someday someone at the label will wake-up and fix this disc. We can only hope."
4,Highly useful and thought provoking,Good content. Able to find useful quotations for presentations. In addition I really enjoyed browsing for pleasure and a few good laughs.
3,Wasp Bar Code Scanner,"My husband purchased this reader to scan the serial number barcodes on cell phones for our business. He gave it only 3 stars because you have to hold it a certain way and when it says long range, it means it doesn't work that well close range, in other words, he didn't know that meant long range only. He says he wouldn't purchase it again for that reason, you have to hold it exactly 6-8 inches away from the barcode, which is a pain when you are trying to scan many barcodes, quickly."
2,So-so. There are much better books out there,"This book is just so-so. There are much better books out there.This book just doesn't give a good big-picture of .Net, so if you are new to .Net, you'll learn some concepts, but you won't see how they fit into the big picture all that well.A premise of this book is that you can take your skills as a VFP developer and transfer them quite easily to .Net. That is not quite correct - you can take your skills as a PROGRAMMER in general and transfer them.I honestly think that you are better off not trying to learn .Net from a VFP perspective, but rather to learn it from scratch. You'll only confuse yourself if you are looking for similarities. I believe that you are best off taking your generic programming concepts (i.e. OO design, structured programming, etc.), and going into .Net fresh. It's a whole different way of thinking, and all it takes is a good overview to get into that way of thinking. Again, I just didn't feel this book provided that."
3,Expensive,"I haven't burned much of this yet, and I plan to compare the ingredients with some in the store. Very expensive especially when the shipping is tacked on. I selected the most standard least expensive shipping and the overall cost with purchase and shipping was $37. Ouch. It says you can burn inside or out, but I plan to only burn outside. I suppose as long as the wick of your torch or lamp is kept low enough, it would burn clean enough for indoors. I had my torch wick out such that the flame was 4 = 5"" tall and of course there was some unburned black smoke coming off. I look forward to a bug-free patio, just think it is more economical to buy locally."
4,Exciting Heavy Prog,"While trolling the Blogs, I came across the obscure group Gift. Blue Apple features tight musicianship, interesting classical-tinged songs and heavy riffs. Similar to early Yes but with a more realistic singer and lyrics. Nice guitars and organ.[DW]"
5,One of The Best RPG Games Ever,"Baulders Gate 2 has a classic appeal that just won't die. I have been playing newer games like World of Warcraft and Elder Scrow IV with there astonishing graphics and challenging play but theres still something that doesnt rank with the likes of Baulders gate 2.To me its the plot and subplots of the game that make this game remarkable. The ability to make choses like what quests, who you want in your party, freedom to act Evil or Good. Each chose can change the game and make the game replay as enjoyable as the first. The charactor creation is as good as it gets for an RPG game. So if you want a game that isnt as keen on visual as it is on it overall story line. Get this game it wont disapiont. even if its 6 years old."
3,"Same old game, more problems...","I must start out that there will never be a RPG game better than the original Baldur's Gate.The problem here with the sequel is that instead of giving you a quality game, they did what everyone else does in the computer game world and changed it in a bad way. I have no idea where they get the system requirements for this one. I have a brand new system with a voodoo card and the game is very choppy and it sucks. Great, the story line is better and the game is bigger, but it is very frustrating to play whenever combat starts and the screen jumps around worse than the first game.Give me a break, Bioware. Spend all that time making endless dialogue and new spells and such, but when you take away playability then the thing might as well jump out at me from the screen, because it is still going to be no fun whatsoever to play.Buy this one only if you have a big money gaming computer and lots of patience, because it will drive you crazy otherwise."
2,God This is a great game but...,For all I have played this game it is just superb. The problem is that it crashes evrey 15 min. I guess i'll have t wait for a patch. All other games on my computer never crash so I ma quite disapointed. I hope interplay will test more carefully next time.
2,Wasn't very happy with this game,"After reading all the excellent reviews for this game I thought I would give it a try. After many hours of trying to get myself to enjoy it I just gave up. Now, I know that this is an RPG game, but personally I find the pace of the game to be much to slow compared to some of the other RPG's that I've played in the past. Also, I highly recommend reading the manual before you play or you will be completely lost. I'm sure many of you out there like these challenging games, but I just thought I would give a different perspective about what to expect. Some aspects of the game I DID like are the graphics. Beautiful scenery and settings throughout the game, and some cool effects with certain characters as well. I also liked the opening cutscene. My advise is only buy this game if you are really into RPG's otherwise I would stay away."
5,Why BG2?,"I've played and beaten BG2 and Neverwinter Nights. My first game was neverwinter nights and i was soon addicted to rpgs ( and Extended Play, Now X play on Tech TV, Everybody better watch Adam!). For christmas i recieved BG2. What did I think of the two? BG2 was way better! Although I found that NN had better graphics BG2 had way better plot and character developement. BG2 also seemed( How can I say it?) More busy. You seemed to be getting more interactions with other charachters, more places to see and explore, and you character seemed to be getting cooler buy the minute (hey you can turn into a frigen' monster). BG2 was like walking into a book that you controlled. I loved NN but RB2 is my easy first pick. Don't agree with me? Well I understand everybody looks for different things in games. Yours may be different than mine."
3,Dungeons and Dragons for the Math Impaired,"The reason to play _Baldur's Gate 2_ (and the other fine games by Interplay) boils down to the fact that it's a faithful reproduction of the D&D game you used to have to play with pencils and dice.Years and years of work went into the design and redesign of the D&D world and I'm not just talking about the rules... I'm talking about the spells, the monsters, the heroes... THE CONTENT.D&D is a world. _Baldur's Gate 2_ is one chapter of that world wrapped up in a fine looking game that plays, well, like a book. You won't be on the edge of your seat... but also won't need to worry about madly running down hallways worried about getting blasted to bits by a rocket launcher._BG2_ makes no major leaps in terms of game design from _BG1_... it's all fine tuning. Dazzling special effects are not what the game is about... it's about many hours of solidly fun game play."
4,Excelent Game,"This Game is deffently worth getting but like all things it could use some improvement. The story line, voices in the game, and graphics are grate but I still find it hard to forget that am still playing a game. I know that is what it is but I'm still looking for that game that is so relistic that I forget it is a game (as we all are). At any rate its well worth the mony and you will get a lot of play time out of it ( I mean alot). The only resion I didn't give it 5 stars is cuz it would have to be perfect and little is."
4,"It's good, but...",I just played it with a friend. It's kinda hard to get the characters where you want them in a battle. Making characters is fun. Anyway.....It's good. -Hylio
5,Baldur's Gate II?,"This is going to be a great game! No, I don't work for Interplay (unfortuantly). But I played Baldur's Gate I, Tales of the Sword Coast, Fallout 2, Fallout 1, Odium which are all roleplaying games by these games. They all are great games. Baldur's Gate 2 is going to be even better. Look out RPG world! Here comes Interplay."
1,Not a good game!,"I spent so much for this game thinking the graphics would be as people have stated, what a joke! This is a game that looks as though it was devrived from the early 90's! With the tech now graphics could have been better for the money! I rather spend my time playing the old Dungens and Dragons then wasting time on this boring game! I regret buying it, I wish I could return it!!! I hope this helps you make the right chose on buying this game ;)"
1,This is not D&D,This game is not D&D. The whole thing is too open ended. There is no real purpose. I quit this game in less than a week. If you play D&D go buy Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor. Now there is a D&D game. Not this.
5,"Few, not even BioWare, follow the path prepared by BG.","Baldur's Gate shows us how great a CRPG can be when the NPC's are well written and placed in the context of a great, epic story. Epics have grandeur and scale, but they also spend a lot of time fleshing out small details. Just read Homer's Iliad as an example.Baldur's Gate did not always have great writing, but it had enough of it to show us a glimpse of what we had been missing in CRPGs. Now with Neverwinter Nights and Icewind Dale it is clear that the focus of both BioWare and Black Isle has shifted away from great storytelling.We can only hope that BioWare's secret RPG project and Black Isle's semi-secret Project Jefferson return to the path perpared by the Baldur's Gate series. Otherwise, we are bound for the Path of Eternal Barrel Smashing."
5,The best game ever made better,"I have not yet played Baldur's Gate 2:Shadows of Amn, but if Baldur's Gate, TOSC, Fallout, and Planescape are any indication of what this game is going to be like, IT WILL BE GREAT! It will look much like Baldur's Gate, one of the best games ever, except everything will be improved. It will have many more spells, items, and monsters, and all will have improved graphics. If you loved Baldur's Gate, you will love this one even more. It is longer than the epic BG 1, and if you do all the side-quests, assuming you know exactly what to do, it can take three hundred hours without the expansion pack that it's bound to have. The great story that enveloped the BG 1 world will be nothing compared to this game. With old characters - Minsc and Boo, Jaheira, and Imoen - new features - strongholds, different sized monsters, and the improved Infinity engine - BG 2 will be the best RPG ever. It was all you loved in BG 1, plus much much more."
2,I'm unable to even play the game,"I'm sure it's a fine game, but I can't even play it. I get as far as the opening intro, and then it crashes. I've sent an email to Black Isle's support address [and recieved a form letter, natch]. I've looked at their customer support site, followed their suggestions, and now am unable even to get as far as the promo video for Icewind Dale. I honestly give up. I shouldn't have to go through this much trouble just to play a game. Do I know anything about my drivers or blah blah blah? No, but I don't think I should. This is not *my* responsibility, this is the responsibility of those developing the game, to make sure it works for whatever's out there [within reason].. not just one or two brands of video/sound cards or whatever [and I've played several other Black Isle games just fine; it's not like I have a crappy computer]. And now that I've worked so long at trying to get this bloody thing to work, I'm not even sure I can return it..."
3,Baldur's Gate 2 is a little iffy...,"It's been about a month since I picked up Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn, and I'm not that impressed. It starts you out in a dungeon that is a little boring and not very intriguing. It also takes about one or two real-time days to get out without help from a strategy guide. Once I was in the second chapter, I was a little more satisfied but not enough. The game is huge, but it's size makes it almost impossible to finish all of the mini-quests that are hidden throughout the land. The graphics are also a little blurry especially since it has that sort of Diablo-type overhead view. Anyway, that game was a little fun and would recommend you to buy it only if you are a die-hard Baldur's Gate fan or if you are REALLY bored."
5,Better than the first,"Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn is an all out great game; practially flawless. The grafics are a breakthrough in the birds-eye-view third peson fantasy RPG's. Game play is great, and the story is wonderful. I couldn't stop playing it. The different areas are extremely detailed, down to the flies circling around dead fish lying on tables. The puzzles will rack your brain continuously, but you never get tired of them. It's much more intellectual than the normal hack and slash games like Diablo 2 or something, and you never get tired of it. The only problem that I had with the entire game, is that there are a couple puzzles that you would never guess unless you looked them up up on the internet. But otherwise the game is flawless. If you havn't played, or do not own Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn, BUY IT IMEDIATELY."
5,Unimaginably entertaining and engrossing,"This is, without a doubt, one of the best games I've ever played. With loads of classes and then tons of kits, the replayability of this game is astounding. The spells are amazing and powerful, and you can spend several (real) days searching for one magic sword (anyone say the Holy Avenger+5?). This game is definetly one for everybody who likes RPGs."
5,Deep and immersive RPG,"Although this is a sprawling game, Bioware have created a superb in-depth RPG with attention to detail. The conversations can sometimes go on a little too much but generally the characters are interesting and ther storylines are well crafted.The non linear aspects of the game - with different tasks to be completed along with a journal really help to create this fantasy world. The sheer amount of spells, weapons and objects can become a bit unwieldy at times. However I would recommend this game to those who like RPGs because it is an enjoyable adventure."
5,Even Better Than the First!!!!,"Baldur's Gate 2 was more then I hoped for. I loved playing Baldur's Gate and Tales of the Sword Coast, and couldn't wait for the sequel. Old characters from the first game return along with so many new ones to choose for your party. There is much more dialogue between characters in this game compared to the last. New items and spells make this game a must for anyone who is even slightly interested in playing a role-playing game. I love the new character kits, which make your characters unique and more specialized. The story line branches off from the main quest to give you more side quests and optional adventures. There's even a chance for your character to fall in love with another party member if you play your cards right. Overall this game has been so much fun and I hope they make a third!"
5,Extraordinary,"Baldur's gate 2 is the best game of all and it will be the best forever.I played the others D&D based games , the ones before and after the realease of BG2 , like neverwinter nights , and I still think it is the best.The system of battles is perfect , you have full control of the actions of your characters , so you can find the best strategy for victory.Lots of intersting characters make this game unforgettble.BG is a great game and BG2 fixes all the few mistakes of the first game.I don't expect to play a better game in my life.BG2 is the best game ever.It is impossible to turn better what is perfect , that is why the games after BG2 are not as good as it is.Be sure , no other will be."
2,Disapointed,"I was very disapointed with the scenery in BG2.The map is too modern looking over the old world style map in BG1.There arent as many places to go,and it takes forever to load when you go to a site on the map.And I thought there were supposed to be improvements over BG1?The character movements are too slow.It takes too long to swing the sword and cast spells.In IWD and BG1,it was much faster,and the character sizes were a tad larger.I think the enemy has a slight advantage in combat due to this mishap.It also lags while walking.I just hope BG3 and the sequel to IWD is much better.As of now,there is nothing from Black Isle for me to look forward too."
2,Whats so great about this?,"This is not Art or Philosophy, or anything close. What it is is a 200 mind-numbing hours long sequel to a traditional, dyed-in-the-wool RPG thats intensely boring. Fighting? yeah its there, but it starts to pale after the first 30 hrs. I'd rather play D2 5 times with different characters on Bnet. This game is just crap."
2,Down Hill,"The story is just to far fetched.Too sci-fi,it went from being a kind of middle aged based game to becoming sci-fi with graphics worst than the first.The portraits are worse,the icons you can barley even tell what it is.Just a lack of animation all together.Its one big dissappointment."
1,a clone of the first,"this game is a clone of the first. let me tell you it sux. the gameplay is exactly the same there are no improvement on graphics and it is very predictable. also your character starts out less powerful then the others. basically it is predicatble,stupid,and not worth the money. if you want better forgotten realms games go for icewind dale or the original baldurs gate. but dont go for nwn or bg2"
3,Single Player not as good as the original,"Ever since I got the original Baldur's Gate for Christmas 2000 from a friend, I've been playing in almost non-stop. For my birthday (July) in 2001, I bought myself the sequel. While installing, I was very excited, and I was very impressed in the beginning by the superior graphics and sound quality. However, two weeks into the game, and I became very less enthusiastic. Why? There's no PLOT. All you do is run around, solving whatever little quest comes up. In the original, there was a goal that you had to complete, and each chapter was leading you up to that final goal. BGII seems to be made up entirely of sub-quests, with no real objective for the player to complete. In my opinion, the whole POINT of an RPG is the plot. In summary, I was very disappointed with the single player campaign. However, although I have not yet tried it, the superior graphics should make this game much more fun in multiplayer that the original."
5,"A WONDERFUL, MASTERPIECE OF A GAME","If you love the Dungeons and Dragons worlds, if you love fantasy, role play, and a great story line chock full of humor, fun, romance mystery and adventure, then this is the game for you! I played it twice, and I loved it both times. Now my wife is addicted to it ^_^"
5,Roughin' It In Montana,"I couldn't lay it down, was up to 4 a.m. reading it. Entertaining and enjoyed that it is based on a real person.Excellent"
2,Not What It Could Have Been,"I too was really excited when I found out this album was being released...but it kind of sucks...like one reviewer said, the mixes aren't the complete full length versions nor are they the edits, so you get neither, just a lazily assembled mishmosh. What they should have done is that they should have made this a 2-cd set, one with the full-length versions of her dance mixes, and one with the single edits (some of her songs were bigger hits, or just as big, in remixed form as in original form, such as ""Un-Break My Heart,"" ""I Don't Want To,"" ""Spanish Guitar,"" ""I Belong To You"" etc., and all those edits would have been perfect for disc 2)."
1,Warning. This product won't last.,"I received this grill cover in early Feb. I patched 8 holes in the vinyl today, March 28. The grill is kept under roof but I live in a windy four season climate. The cloth underlayer is holding up fine. However, the thin vinyl coating is tearing in all kinds of different places. I tossed my canvas grill cover after 7 years as it finally ripped through. This cover hadn't really lasted for 7 weeks. In the near future I'll be going back to canvas."
4,Basic tips,"This book is helpful for those who haven't yet had to interact with someone close to them having cancer. For those who've helped another or several other cancer patients, it is a good book to take along when visiting family or friends who may not know anything about what a cancer diagnosis can do to one's outlook and quality of life. It is most helpful in reminding each of us that each cancer patient and family/friends will approach the reality differently. We can be respectful of that and of the decisions made to deal with cancer treatment."

4,Really 3.5 stars but I rounded up...,"I am a huge Julie Garwood fan and I can honestly say that except for the Roses novellas and Come Spring (bought the books, just couldn't get into them), I have read everything (multiple times) that she has written in the historical romance and modern day romance/suspense genre. I love how she blends the suspense with a love story. While I thought this was a good read, it was not my favorite by her. I thought the plot was a little shallow. Heartbreaker and Mercy are better reads in this series. I thought the friends doing research on the con man was an extraneous storyline that really did not need to such an integral part of the story. I did like the chemistry between Alec and Regan and thought it could have been developed a little more. I also love Noah Clayborne and the friends without the side murder mystery. I look forward to reading Slow Burn in the near future and I am also looking forward to a story on the rest of the Buchanans and Noah."
3,"Margins and type too large,","For the price, this book should have been twice as long. The margins were too wide, the type face too large and the story... oh well, Garwood got 3 stars, something I thought I never would do."
3,"Weak suspense and character, but interesting premise and fun friends","More like 2 1/2 stars. I really liked the Sophie-Cordie-Regan friendship *I hope Garwood gives us stories for them soon!*, but the suspense took a backseat to the romance and wasn't as exciting, which really made Regan seem neurotic. Also didn't like how Regan still let her brothers boss her around, and that she ended up compromising her values for them on the whole Emerson deal. Lastly, the whole relationship between Regan and Alec bordered just a little too closely on ""hate"" for my taste and was annoying with Alec's stupidity. My favorite is still Garwood'sMercy."
3,Ok...,"Regan Madison and her two friends, Sophie and Cordie are attempting to uncover the truth about a self help guru that they believe is a con man and possibly a murderer. In an effort to find the real story they attend a weekend seminar and are asked to make a list of people that ""poison"" their world and who they would like to see gone from their lives. Then the people on Regan's list are dying....Let me first say that this is not my usual genre so I'm not entirely sure how these type of stories usually pan out, but it seems like there is very little written about the actual murder mystery part and more about Regan, Alex, her brothers and their relationships. I didn't find the story very suspenseful or scary but it was a quick read that I found fairly absorbing and interesting..and I did find myself wondering who the killer was through most of the book."
2,Just didn't live up to its premise,"The entire book was contrived, forced, and unrealistic.I'm glad I got it free."
4,"Add this to your ""list""","I enjoyed this book but I have to say I really miss Julie's historical romances. They are among my all time favorites. This one is not, but I did like it. If you are a fan of Julie's then by all means read this one. I have no doubt you will enjoy it. I like how she gave us a hint of what was happening with some of our favorite characters from previous books. I think we will see one of those returning people or one from this book headlining their own before long. It definelty left you with that feeling. I loved the friendship angle with this book. The only down side was I thought it took a while to get the two main characters to fall for each other. happy reading!"
1,FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE FANS OF GARWOOD...,"Ive only gotten about half way through this book and I am bored with the story line. Im even skipping ahead to see if it gets any better. And after reading the majority of these reviews, I can see that it doesn't.I used to be a HUGE fan of Garwood. I have every single one of her historical novels. I read them over and over again. I have too since this new contemporary stuff shes been writing is so awful.So for those of you that are fans of the historical Garwood novels, WRITE to her and ask her to go back to what she does best. I did. And she wrote back and told me that she was under contract to only write this drivel. And so I wrote back and asked her if she would ever write historical again and she became defensive about it. Real eye opener there.So sad."
2,so disappointing...,"I'm another avid Julie Garwood fan, but this book was a dud. No one writes historical fiction better than Ms. Garwood, but she's making the same mistake other historical writers (McNaught) have made, by turning to writing contemporary novels. None of her contemporary novels begin to compare to her historicals. I too wasted big bucks on a hardcover copy of this one - wish I'd waited to check it out at the library."
2,Not her best,"am a huge Julie Garwood fan. I have all her books, and had to replace a few for I read them so much that they got worn. I can even tell you some of the small errors that the editors made. I was disappointed when she changed her writing style, but after reading her first contemporary novel, I was hooked again. This book will not we one that will be read alot, if again. If I didn't know better I would swear it wasn't a Julie Garwood book. To much like Mary Higgens Clark, who is a wonderful author, but not Julie Garwood. Her usual humorous and loveable characters were missing, as well as the passion between her characters. If I hadn't read all her books, and had started with this one, I probably would have enjoyed it more. Hope this isn't her newest style."
2,BIG YAWN,I will start out by saying I never buy hardback books but love this author so i peeled out the money. BIG mistake! While the book was readable and kept my attention somewhat i should have waited for it to come in at the local library.What happen to the days when you could'nt put a book down? When you got behind on everyday chores just to get in the next chapter? This was not that kind of book. Sorry it was a big YAWN!!
3,Not Garwood's best,"Hotel heiress Regan Madison manages her family's charitable foundation. She has three bossy big brothers and two best girl friends. She attends a weekend seminar with her friends and, as an exercise, writes a ""murder list"" of people she'd like to see dead. Through a series of HUGE coincidences an insane killer gets the list and starts killing people on it.Detective Alec Buchanan is assigned as Regan's bodyguard. Alec has accepted a job with the FBI and is just waiting out his notice to quit the police force.Set in Chicago, this story was ponderous and, at 425 paperback pages, much too long. The killer's connection to Regan was ridiculous. Alec was a great character, grounded and real. Regan needed more spine. The killer's thoughts were boring. I like Garwood's historical stories - too bad she quit writing them."
3,Didn't quite live up to Garwood,"This book was okay. I devoured Mercy and Killjoy, this one simply did not have the UMPH that the other two had. I had to read it, because a Buchanan was in it, I did like it, it just lacked a little magic. Don't buy it, get it from the library. If you like the family, it's worth the read. I am going on to Slow Burn, which I hope the magic returns."
2,Audio CD: the voices were **all** wrong,"I'm on the last CD of this and the story seems much less interesting than the premise. However, I have to comment that the voices are just so wrong. In particular the voice of the heroine is just completely wrong (I can't be specific without being rude). The voice of the romantic interest is also just completely wrong - he doesn't sound handsome or appealing - again, I don't want to be rude. At one point, there is someone who is supposed to be a young adult, and the voice is not young, etc. I'm completely unable to follow the story because I'm so distracted and turned off by the voices."
2,Disappointing,"A rehash of ""Heartbreaker"", without the interesting sideline of Noah. Ms. Garwood is one of the few authors whose work I will pay for in hardcover, as soon as it's released. I wish I had waited on this one. I had the impression she was rushing to meet a deadline, so she just changed a few details of ""Heartbreaker"" and submitted it as a new story."
1,Worth What I Paid For It!,"Like the previous reviewers, I got this book as a free promo. I had never read Julie Garwood before, and there was nothing in the story that would prompt me to pay actual money to read any more of her work. The writing was poor, the plotting was worse and there was no suspense.For people who like romantic suspense,may I suggest that you try some by good writers like Susan Isaacs,Elizabeth Peters or even Charlaine Harris. This stuff isn't worth the time it takes to read it.Reviewer: Renee S. N.Y.C."
2,Not what I thought this would be,"This book was okay - it was nothing spectacular, there was no suspense, and I didn't like most of the characters.The problem with this novel is it starts off strong and then just sort of fades away. I can't say much more without giving it away, but I was disappointed and I expected a lot more out of the book."
3,Not too bad,"I still pine for Julie Garwood to return to historical romance, but in the meantime, another outing in the Buchanan clan. This one has a decent fleshing out of the heroine for a change. I rolled my eyes when I read she is a hotel heiress, but I was pleasantly surprised that J. Garwood gave her a personality and friends with personality. The opening chapter where they meet is vintage Garwood.I have the usual gripes with this story as with all the contemporary novels: it's too muddled. Too many characters, too many subplots, but at least the leads had scenes together and talked about their attraction so it didn't feel like the-now standard-one night stand came from left field. I really wish J. Garwood would do away with the murder subplot and focus on the love story which is really her strong point. Murder List is worth reading, but not owning."
1,The worst book,This book has no content. It's not worth reading I am so glad I took it out of the library or I would go back to the bookstore and demand my money back.
2,I was somewhat disappointed,"It was my first novel by the author so I wasn't sure what to expect. The story was dragging for too long. As I was reading the book I was surprized on how little things had progressed as I was getting to the end of the book.I felt the author was reflecting too much of herself in Regan.I'm definitely not an expert in analyzing books or writing methods, but when I read a book I look for good story telling techniques and that means I don't want to see the author in the story.Similarly, an excellent actor plays different roles without any aspect of his/her personal character leaking out.I recommend reading this novel for comparison but it definitely did not make an impression."
2,hollow,"Unfortunately I found the book lacking in story line, character development and just boring. Something was missing. I have all her books and love the easy reading that sweeps me away after a long day in the real world. A book is good when you forget where you are and become part of the book. This did not happen with this book. I still heard the world around me and I definately never left it. I finished it but was disappointed."
2,Not up to the standard set by other Garwood novels,I was initial looking forward to reading thie book as I have enjoyed several other Garwood novels. This novel had an interesting start but slowed down to a snails pace. The plot twisted in to a story of a budding romance vs. suspense. The story only got back on track in the last couple dozen pages. I would not recommend this book.
2,Really boring,"I don't know if I just didn't like the way JG writes or this story is farfetched. The book has several stories and all of them are boring. The killer who wants to kill Regan but before he tries to slaughter all the persons she hated just to please her is pathetic. The way Dr. Shields draw a new life to his ""students"" is more than trite. In addition her book goes out of those stories so many times that is really boring.Query:How can any employee make whatever he wants to his/her boss and nobody does anything?"
2,Not very intriguing,"This is a boy meets girl novel with the ""murder list"" playing second fiddle to what is essentially a love story. If you like love stories, you might like this novel. But, if you are looking for an interesting mystery/thriller you should look elsewhere."
4,I loved it but...,"I am the fortunate one who translates Julie Garwood's works into Hungarian and I must say I loved all her books I got a chance to read. Though I think Bride is the best, I am always anxious to read her thrillers, and the Buchanan brothers is the thing that really worth waiting for. As my title says I loved this book, too, but I think there is too much resemblence to the first book, The Heartbreaker and that is a little bit disappointing :-("
4,Solid Machine,"I used this machine for almost three years at work. I am a bit of a tool snob, but was suprised at this machine. It holds it's outfeed table adjustments. The sprial head is excellent. The power of the motor was very substantial. My only complaints were the cutterhead gaurd and the fence. You have to position the gaurd so that it doesn't strike the fence when it returns or it will knock the fence out of square."
4,GREAT FUN -in or out of the bathtub!,"My nine-month-old son truly enjoys this book. First of all, its plastic pages withstand not only water but also tiny teeth, so I don't have to worry about him ""eating"" the pages as with other books. Secondly, he pays close attention while I read the book to him; while there isn't much of a storyline, the phrases form a catchy rhyme. When we are done reading, I allow him to play with the front cover which has a squeaky detachable fish for him to chew and a squishy fish scene to feel. I recommend this book to any parent of a baby who loves to chew on books - this one is engaging and quite durable!"
3,Celebratory Euro-Dance Track,"In this sports-themed Euro-dance track (created for the 2000 Soccer Tournaments), E-Type brings us an energetic song with a celebratory mood. E-Type, always one to release catchy, Swedish singles with unforgettable beats, brings us yet another good song. However, it is not the usual pop single. This is more of a stomp-your-feet Euro-indulgence for the true E-Type fan. Good single, but not great."
2,Beating the same dead horses...,"The prose in this book is well composed, and the story is easy to follow. My problem with it is that it is essentially the same story in books like Babbitt -- small-town snobbery and how people deal with it. The protagonist just becomes whiney and self-absorbed as she deals with the snarky people of her town -- she is just another manifestation of her social set.If you haven't read other books by Lewis, then this is worth reading. If you've read his other work, you may get bored quick with this one."
3,Main Street/Sinclair Lewis,Fun easy read. Pertains to today's neighborhood interpersonal relationships.All people seem resistant to change. However change is inevitable anywhere.
1,Boring,I picked the book because it was chosen by the library book club. I never finished the book. It was painfully boring.
3,What a Weird Format!,"Okay, so when I ordered this, I was not expecting (1) the book to look like a softcover textbook for an economics class (the text is normal size, fyi), or (2) it to have been printed to order just for me! Yes, seriously - I suppose the book must be in the public domain, because there is no publisher's information or the usual copyright page in the front of the book (you know, the one that says where to find it in the Library of Congress) AND the final page includes a barcode and the statement ""Printed in the USA on [date that I placed my order with Amazon]."" Really, very strange. All that said, it's perfectly readable if you're not taking the large book anywhere, and there's plenty of room for marginalia and such."
4,People are people,"A wonderful insight into life in an American small town during the early 20th century. Many of the characters seem much like people in todays society with the same jealousies, bigotries, and political extremes. However, it shows that people can be influenced by others (both positively and negatively) and even grow over time."
3,Different,"well, If you wanna start with the Cockney Kids try the first 2 cds (if you want oi punk rock). this album is slowler than others, but isn't stupid glam like next albums, is just different and stills good. there are really catchy songs like ""on the run"" and ""it's over"" and the last track is singed by the gonads vocalist. no bad but don't expect a punk rock oi album."
4,PRETTY COMFY,"Bought these with a little hesitation at the beginning (that's because I'm tall and my feet are big, didn't know if they would look good on me), but they did! and must say that these shoes are very comfortable, I wear them almost daily!It's a good buy"
4,Victoria's victory,"When you begin to listen this CD, your first surprise is to hear some instruments, specially viola. Tomás Luis de Victoria composed all the pieces that contains the CD only for voices, but Jordi Savall prefered to add some staff. Certainly, this great conductor uses only intruments from Renaissance, and the collective sounds with delicated texture, specially in the case of Salve Regina and Magnificat Primi Toni for eight voices. Finally, you forgot the conductor, the instruments and also yourself and relish the music of this master of the vocal music, probably, with Pallestrina, the best harmonizer of a large number of different voices. If you are interested in harmony as a musical discipline, or simply if you stir with beauty, you will find in this CD many minutes of satisfaction."
2,"4.5 stars, really?","I purchased this cover based on the number of good reviews, but I am writing this review in response to these glowing reviews. First off, some reviewers mentioned this cover is perfect for a smaller grill with no/collapsible sides. Not true. This cover is sewn to accommodate the sides as well as a small grill. The only thing that makes this small is the fact that it's short. Second, the quality of the cover is poor. I agree with another reviewer in that it really is just a dark green vinyl tablecloth (lined with felt) sewn to fit a wide grill. Quality-wise, it doesn't even come close to the previous cover I had, which was made with heavy water resistant fabric. To be fair, this does have velcro fasteners. Personally, I'll be happy if I get one year out of this cover. In this case, it seems to me that you really do get what you pay for."
3,Fell Apart,"I bought this in December and I now looking for a new one. This one disintegrated. We have had a lot of wind here and now there are holes and the white is showing through. As long as you don't have a lot of wind and weather elements, this is a pretty good cover. It fit our small grill very well, but it's very thin."
4,"Great value, but will it last...","I have one of those old barbecue's with no shelf's that seats on a pedestal. I couldn't find one of those straight covers so in desperation tried this one. The small size is roomy but fits great and I like the Velcro fasteners. Everyone was bothered by the color, but the dark green looks good to me. My only concern is that the fabric seems thin compared to the old one I am replacing. We'll see if it holds up."
4,Good all around cover,"Although I am using this to cover something other that a grill, it does the job nicely. With the end tabs that enable you to secure it you can almost make it fit whatever you need to cover. In my case a work cart. Does the job and for $10 how can you go wrong. Did not really want green but oh well, it seems to be made pretty good also with the lining adding some heft to it."
3,Squirrels ate my cover,"I bought this in the spring 2010. It's a nice cheap cover, thin vinyl but the fiber backing adds some strength to it. Worked great the whole summer. But in October, it started to get chewed to shreds. I finally saw one of the backyard squirrels merrily ripping it up. I think it was after the fiber lining, to finish off its winter nest. Anyway, the cover was destroyed and I had to buy another one (without lining)."
2,CRACKS!!,"I bought this cover (perhaps not the exact same size) a little over 2 years ago. In the discription it claims, ""Fire-retardant fabric offers UV protection and resists cold cracking."" Well after about 1 1/2 years it began cracking and tearing all along the top. The grill does sit in the hot Savannah sun. But it is obvious that the claim of UV protection is false. I would rather pay a little more money and get one that wouldn't have to be replaced every couple of years. I will say that if your grill is in a sheltered area, it might last longer. But they shouldn't make claims that are not true."
5,Great & Can't beat the Price,This grill cover is great. It's of equal quality to those with much higher price tags. None of them last long - especially if you live in a place where you experience hot summers and cold winters. It fit my small gas grill perfectly and is a bit shorter than my previous one - which means it's less apt to get hit by the weed wacker in the summer. It just survived a blizzard and did not budge. Now it's protecting my grill under 2 feet of snow. Recommended.
4,Decent for the Price,Small size covers are hard to find. This one works well and for the price is decent. It is relatively light and flexible and will see how it holds up over time.
2,Lasted one season,"Cover has cracked in multiple places after only one year of use, letting in water and opportunistic squirrels seeking bedding material for their nests (the cracking happened first). Maybe it's the tough winters we have here, or maybe the thin vinyl top-layer is of poor quality. Either way, this item was no more durable than a $10 cover I bought from Walmart previously. Seriously disappointed."
3,Needs new title....,"I have to agree with the previous reader's review. This was book was somewhat disappointing for several reasons. One, this book was not about ""Group Sex"" at all. Group sex was only part of a group conversation that took place on one evening of the entire book! I can't help but to wonder if the author used the title to attract 'would-be' readers... Second, most of the secondary characters in the book were extremely bland and boring, but I believe that may have been the author's intention to emphasize the life of the main character, Frances. Third, the reader may or may not understand why Frances would stay in a topsy-turvy relationship with Paul Treat, a theatre playwright, and the reader may grasp this in the very ending of the book where Frances finally voices her desires."
3,Uncomfortable,"Having been introduced to Arensburg's work through the magnificent ""Incubus,"" I was a little disappointed with ""Group Sex."" A truly disturbing tale of a young editor and her love (?) affair with a theatre director.Although I finished the book in the matter or two days, it was an uncomfortable read. The main character allows her lover to completely reform her, pulling her in and out of distorted shapes. The main character is uncomfortable with her lover through most of the novel, and the reader senses this.Because I think Arensburg is a gifted and talented writer, I cannot completely malign the book. ""Group Sex"" is a quick read, and an engaging one, although a bit disturbing for this reader."
1,EXACT SAME AS 4th ED.,"The words, organization, and photos in this edition are the exact same as the fourth edition. The organization hasn't changed one bit. The only significant ""updates"" (aside from the font change) are two short sections that were added in Chapters 12 and 14. We're talking a page or two of new text. This is a really pathetic attempt at making a few insignificant changes to charge everyone more. Save your money and buy the 4th edition!"
5,"A clear, well written text",Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy is a clear and well written text. Excellent pictures and drawings add to the clarity and enhanced my enjoyment.
4,Good General Intro to Sedimentology,"I am a sedimentologist and I teach as a TA an undergraduate sedimentologist class. Sam Boggs's book is a classic a bit of everything intro book. If you are considering to teach with this book an undergraduate class, my opinion is that is ok, I am more of a process-bases sedimentologiest to I preferEarth Surface Processes, Landforms and Sediment DepositsorEarth Surface Processes.However, if you are an undergraduate student that are taking this class... buy it... it will help you a lot for the exams, get a used one, this version or the older versions are just fine... you can then sell it...If you want to go and work for the oil industry... you can talk about field camp and how much you didnt like the Boggs... lolCheers"
4,Amazing!,"I picked up this movie, not really knowing what to expect from it. I had never heard of 'The Goat,' but when a guy like Abdul-Jabaar gives praises to him you know it must have been legit.This movie takes you back in time, Harlem basketball was very popular, some of the best players to play the game were playing on the streets and some say the very best was 'The Goat.'However, this young man was getting into a lifestyle of drugs that was becoming to hard to turn away from. His girlfriend became pregnant and his mentor passed away. His college coach would not let him play his game and soon drugs were his only option.I will say that my criticism with this movie is that the whole drug life scenes were a little long in some places, yet it was a really good film!"
3,My friend bought this,I dont have really anything to say about this because my friend bought it. She seems to like it though she said she has watched it over and over already.
5,biggest reliable bang for the buck,"Why Grizzley instead of JET? My choice was based on other reviewed air filtration systems. cost of replacement filters and support. All make Grizzly my number one choice given my budget considerations.Yes it is made in China, and what isn't now. Whenever I get to play furniture builder with the pros I will buy the very expensive stuff.Delived promptly, even when I was told there was a delay and I was ok with the delay, because service let me know so I could plan. Packaging was undamaged...see other reviews.Service is first rate! ...see other reviews.Works efficiently in filtering my dusty shop at low speed. As mentioned noisy when reved up. I would rather it had a lower profile, but it is able to sit high in the rafters of my shop.Oh yeah, did I mention filter cost comparison?"
4,G9956 Air Filter Review,"The product is being used to cut down on the amount of dust that is collecting on my cars in my garage. And with the exception of being loud it is doing a very good job. I ust to have to wipe down my cars every other day, and since I purchased the G9956 I have only had to do it once in 3 weeks."
4,Celeste Holm in a largely-forgotten musical,"Celeste Holm sounds fabulous in this largely-forgotten musical, now re-issued as part of the new selection of releases from Decca Broadway.BLOOMER GIRL was Holm's first musical after creating the role of Ado Annie Carnes in the original Broadway production of OKLAHOMA! (which starred Alfred Drake and Joan Roberts). BLOOMER GIRL also featured fellow OKLAHOMA! co-star Joan McCracken as the comic lead and choreographer Agnes De Mille, creating the now-legendary ""Civil War Ballet"".BLOOMER GIRL's rich score includes the lilting ""Evelina"" and the lullabye ""Satin Gown and Silver Shoe"" for Ms Holm to sing in her unmistakable vocal style.Decca Broadway has done a great job restoring the original session tapes of the 1944 recording. There is a large amount of crackle and background hiss and some minor dropouts, but with the limitations of the analogue format, this goes with the territory.A highly-recommended recording for Broadway fans."
3,Not a bad Collectors Item,"So often times, an old show like this, is just boring and not the best vocals. Well some women in this show aren't great, but for the most part this is a good CD. The lyrics are pretty funny, and the orchestrations arent to ancient. Good for collecotrs only. Favorite song: ""The Eagles and Me"""
4,SWEET,"I love this game! You get to run around join gangs,shoot people,and get busted by the cops. I don't like the 2-d but the lighting effects are awsome. Get this game you'll thank me."
3,Its alright for awhile a rent not a buy.,"I like running from the cops and crashin into innocents and even killing them in the game. But it gets so boring. You do several jobs for some weird organizations and try to complete it to earn lots of money. When you reach 1 million, you goto another level. Trust me if you wanna buy this game dont. Rent it at blockbuster or wherever. Its nice for awhile, but then gets so boring."
4,"A solid Dreamcast port, but the game shows its age.","Without a doubt, this is a very solid port. The graphics are much better, and the game still plays just as well. However, you will notice that it is dated. They have everything that made the PS One version great, but between the unresponsive Dreamcast controls and dated premise, you are better off waiting for GRAND THEFT AUTO 3."
3,"Fun, but...","This was a fun game, really. I loved causing accidents, stealing cars, and performing jobs. However, for Dreamcast, i would have expected much better graphics. It looks like a Genesis game. This is a great RENT, but don't spend your money."
3,"Rent it, don't buy it.","Interesting concept but not done very well. Awkward controls seem to realy hurt this games score. The graphics aren't bad, but not spectacular. I found it hard to get to any of the jobs you are givin without running over someone or crashing into another car. This posseses a problem when your trying to avoid the cops. It's ok, I would not advise buying it. Rent it and buy the time it's due back you will be ready for something better."
2,Not very good,"When I rented this game, I expected it to be better. The missions that they ask you to go on are confusing, I had no clue what to do, the instruction booklet was useless and didn't help me at all.It is only fun to create accidents and set the cars on fire, but that wasen't even the plot of the game.I am 11 years old, and I found it confusing."
2,"Fun, but gets old","GTA2 is very fun. The thrill of taking out your machine gun and blowing innocent civilians and/or cops is exhilerating. Sometimes, when you are lucky you can find the tank, now that is fun! But, soon, this will get very boring, constantly running from the cops and rarely beating them. I recommend that you don't buy this, but instead rent it for a couple of days, becuase by the time you have to return it, you will be tired of it."
3,Not much better than Playstation,"This is a fun game and it's addicting, but I was let down. I've played this on my friends playstation before and I was expecting the Dreamcast version to be much better. Instead they are just about the same. The graphics are weak on this game. It's still a fun game though. It's worthy of some attention."
4,An excellent book for beginners - intermediate.,"This book is excellent for those of you that just started learning bass.This book has examples of music styles up to the 90's.For example: southern rock, prog rock, prog metal, jazz, blues, country, death metal, punk, salsa, bossa nova, etc.There is little example on the recent music styles *well you can say that current music styles are just derivative of the examples given*The examples are easy to follow, even for beginner. They're also pretty accurate in explaining the music styles.I use this book to teach my student."
5,A wonderfully refreshing CD,"After hearing about Oleander on the radio, I have toadmit that they should be just as popular as U2 or Train.If you own February Son, this CD is sort of like arefreshing cool-down from their previous CD. And thisone REALLY rocks out!!! There are a few songs that arerefreshing, hard rocking, and some soft and melodic.The only complaint I have is that a couple of the songson here are a little boring and repetitive, such as""Goodbye"", and ""Jimmy Shaker Day"". The rest are GREAT!"
4,Very good CD,"I was very pleased with this CD. Being new to Oleander, I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! They remind me of Fuel, although more upbeat. Catchy songs, excellent lyrics...you can listen to this CD over and over and it just gets better! If you like Fuel, Collective Soul and the like, you will like this CD!"
5,Rockin' CD,Oleander has made another great collection of music. This is cd is just like February Son you can put it in a listen to it over and over again. A wonderful friend turned me onto them and now I just can't get enough. Grab your copy today you won't be disappointed. IT ROCKS!
2,"Soft, too soft",I don't like music like this. It's ok sometimes but this is just too soft for my taste i'm (not) sorry. That's it.
2,Third rate Collective Soul...,Alt/Metal band from Sacramento...nothing great but better than a lot of the heavy metal/rap crap out there today. I would rate them a third rate Collective Soul.
5,Scott Devours rulz!,i've never owned any oleander before but it came recommended to me by a friend. i bought it and it is incredible! great driving music. the fuel that the drummer gives this band is insatiating!!! wow! if you have any appreciation for percussion/drums-get this cd to learn what its all about!!! kudos oleander-smart move with the new guy!
1,Yawn,I dont think I have heard a more boring collection of sound as this in my life. The only audio that compares to the yawnarific attempt made by oleander to put me to sleep is that of the book on tape versions of Great Expectations. The lead singer in this band puts as much emotion in his singing as I would reccomend you put money into buying this cd. None.
3,Decent.. but a letdown from debut disc,"It would be very hard to duplicate what Oleander put together on their February Son CD. That was one incredible album. I was looking for a better effort on this new album though. This album has some catchy tunes, but it all sounds the same. There aren't too many standout songs on the CD, and that's mainly what separates the 2 albums. All in all, this is a decent album. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it if I had to do it all over again, but it's tolerable."
2,Scares my 3 year old to tears,"After reading the reviews, we thought this would be a great way to introduce our son to Winnie the Pooh. Big mistake. This DVD scared my child to tears. It is scary, confusing and hard for him to comprehend all the chaos going on. I was actually surprised that I also found this DVD too much for a toddler to handle. This, and the other Pooh DVD we purchased, will be going away for a couple of years."
5,Wonderful.,This is such a great video of winnie the pooh it keeps my child watching this over and over again. There always are great things my child learns when she watches winnie the pooh. She loves every minute of this.
5,Pooh Bear,"I was looking for Winnie the Pooh that my kids enjoyed, but they haven't been made into DVD. This was an ok substitute for my 3 year old granddaughter, but not quite what I hoped for. Good entertainment."
3,I think I was surprised by how old and really non-educational this is. I'm not gettig any other from this series.,I think I was surprised by how old and really non-educational this is. I'm not gettig any other from this series.
3,Lizard Music,"The book that i am going to tell you about is called Lizard Music. It was a pretty good book. The setting of Lizard Music is in more than one place. The setting helps to make the story more exciting because because where victor goes is a little weird. Especially the the people. The Chicken man was a really weird character. He would walk around with his chicken Claudia on his head. Victor the main characterwent from being a scared little boy to a brave little boy. In the beginning he kept on getting scared because ke kept on seeing lizards all over the place. In the end he didn't mind seeing the lizards. I think that the moral of this book is do not judge a book by it's cover because the cover that I saw was a really boring cover,but if I saw the new cover I would probably want to read it. It ended up being a good book though. The end of the story ended up being very predictable. If Victor kept on seeing lizards everywhere then you could assume that he was going to meet them."
5,The Best Book I Ever Read,"I love this book. I loved it when I was ten, I loved it when I was twenty, and I still love it now that I'm thirty. It's one of those books that just sticks with you. I have named several pets Reynold in honor of the lizards. Someday I will get my raft and a chicken and find the lizards for myself. Daniel Pinkwater is a comic genius and his books should be required reading for any child with a sense of humor."
3,"OK, but didn't really grab me.","It was an OK book, but seemed to be trying too hard for surrealism, and when it ended there didn't seem to be a lot of point to it."
2,Unreliable,"Misha Glenny has been out of the spotlight recently, and with good reason. He repeatedly equated the sides fighting in the Balkans and concluded that using force against the Serbs in Bosnia would not work. How totally wrong he proved to be. I am compelled, as a result, to call into question the assumptions found in his book."
1,Not a good book...at all,"I was looking for an overview of the balkan conflict. This book does not offer that. It does not give someone without a great deal of prior knowledge a good historical reference for what led to war. I feel like the author of this book assumes the reader is extremely familiar with the conflict and decided to write a book sharing some of his personal experiences that coincided with major events in the conflict. The chapters severely lack coordination. As somebody else mentions it goes into way too much detail about insignificant figures. I also purchased ""Yugoslavia, Death of a Nation"". Though I've only finished the introduction and first chapter I already feel like I've learned more than after completion of ""The Fall of Yugoslavia"". Maybe after completing ""Death of a Nation"" going back through ""The Fall of Yugoslavia"" might be interesting, doubt it though..."
3,Uninterestingly Interesting........,"I find it Unintelligently interesting how the world are now masters at our own history, especially the English,and now know all about the Balkans.You read a book or two, and believe you know what's right and and what's not.It's obvious who the culprits were, though as time progressed within the situation, is when all 3 became relatively equal, especially with certain powers in control of their respective governments.Misha Glenny did well with his Balkan book. Although, I've read this book over and over, he's had the tenacity and ability for a reader to lose interest within the introduction itself. Unless, one doesn't have a proper understanding of what Ex-Jugoslavija was all about.Mr.Glenny, don't show your biasim so early in a book. Get your message across in an appropriate form of language with the reader still holding that book.No love lost for being a Pro-Srb, their masters at 'Propaganda'!Ex-Crni Gorac"
1,Poorly written and not up-to-date.,"I have read some very good books on the Balkan region. This is one of the most poorly written books on any subject. It purports to be a personal account of travels through Yugoslavia before and during its fall. But, there are way too many detailed references to minor political figures and small towns to keep track of. Nor do they seem to be mentioned for any particular reason. The book lacks focus and purpose. It is also now hopelessly out-of-date, despite revisions. One of the author's predictions is that the Serbs will never make Kosovo an issue for miltary control--granted he said this over 5 years ago. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
5,A rising star,"John has a gorgeous voice, and the songs on this CD are an old-fashioned pleasure to listen to. If you like Harry Connick Jr., Peter Cincotti, or even John Raitt, check this guy out. It's pretty romantic stuff, but you'll love it even you're listening on your own. A must-have for jazz vocal fans who want to be on the cutting edge."
1,It's ok.,"It was ok at the start, didn't pop all kernels but I dealt with it. Now it throws the kernels/popped corn everywhere. Just have to chase them."
4,Good But Not Great,"MDK2 is better than the first because you can play with more charecters.This game is funny, but hard.I got stuck on 2 levels and had to use a cheat to get to the next level.The proffesur is the most harddest one, but I made it.It took me along time to beat this game.If u like thinking games this is for u.The only 1 thing I dont know in this game, is what the hell does MDK stands for?If u know please righ me, my E-Mail is: superstas3000hotmail.comOh and if you are stuck, then go to: www.cheatplanet.com where there is a lot of cheats. (Thats where I got the cheats from)I hope this was helpful, and remember if u know what MDK stands for then right me please.Thanks. :-)"
3,The demo is better than the game,"The graphics are amazing, and the concept is great. But there is just too much jumping around. It's very annoying. Many of the levels would be impossible without repeated game saving. The demo is better than the game itself because there's only a modicum of jumping."
2,It kept blowing up,"I would have liked to play this game but it would not cooperate. It kept crashing, crashing, crashing. I wish developers would finish a game before they release it."
4,MDK2,"i bought this game for my 7 years old kid. He learned to play this game from his cousins, now he is in love with this game. I know it has violence but it is against aliens. You can customize your controls for any key on keyboard, and combine the controls with the mouse buttons. So you can run, turn around, look around and fire at the same time. It is a great game. I don't like the episodes where doctor Hawkins has to deactivate bombs because is some boring, but it is part of the game. i recommend it, i just bought MDK 1."
3,Not the first game...,"This game was decent enough. It was pretty fun at first, and had pretty good graphics, but got boring and repetitive as it went on. Certainly not as fun as the first game, and I don't know why. Playing the dog was fun, but for some reason mouse movements slower to a crawl. You find yourself having to pick the mouse up at least one time just to turn 180 degrees. The professor's levels were okay. Decent puzzles, but too boring. In my opinion, they should have done away with the professor and dog levels, and just had the sniper guy (I don't remember any of the names...). Those levels were pretty fun. So-so game overall."
1,No Buy Because of George McConnell,"I think George McConnell is the person that makes this DVD a no Buy! I paid good money to buy a DVD, thinking i was going to hear the band that I loved. Instead I find a half rate guitar player on a movie. I think if more movies are to be released then Widespread Panic should find themselves someone else to star in the role of Lead guitar."
2,"Pump is fine, but the pressure gauge is not accurate",I was hoping to be able to pump up my tires and not have to deal with a pressure gauge. I was disappointed that the pressure reading was considerably off from my two other pressure gauges (which agree with each other).
3,Comfortable and Big,"I very much enjoyed this big, comfortable sleeping bag! It, of course, doesn't wrap up as small as it came, which is slightly annoying. But the only thing I am unhappy about is that I have to go to a cleaners or a laundry mat with an industrial sized washer to wash it (I don't camp very much so I didn't expect that sort of thing).Otherwise, I love the feel and comfort. This sleeping bag came in very handy when the temperatures dropped to the high 30's and I used the bag to completely cover me and keep me warm!"
3,Hardly a 25 degree sleeping bag,"The bag is rated for 25 degrees, but I found I was very cold when it was 50 degrees outside (I had a thermometer with me). It is very comfortable and I like the larger size. I just need to bring a heavy woolen blanket to use over the bad to keep really warm."
3,So So,"I bought two of these sleeping bags in February and just got them out last week to use for a camping trip later this month.They're bigger than average, and soft (cotton, not nylon) which is exactly what I was looking for.The only downfall is that the Coleman name isn't what it used to be. One of the bags is just fine. The other bag has a broken zipper. One of the teeth is crooked on the side near the bottom, leaving a 4"" opening when you close the zipper. I doubt I can return it now since I bought it two months ago, and we're leaving in two weeks. I don't have time to wait for exchanges now."
4,Good value,"I've never bought a sleeping bag before, not being the camping type. I purchased this bag to go on a series of retreats. The accommodations were inside, so I didn't use it in a tent. But it was warm and very comfy in the situation in which I used it, nice and roomy, and I slept like a baby. Excellent value."
3,Nice and Big,"Well i got what I paid for, warm sleeping bag at a cheap price. soo its huge. but other than that its fine."
4,4-1/2 Star Christian Chick-Lit Mystery Book,"The Trouble with Tulip by Mindy Starns Clark is the first book in the Smart Chick mystery series. Jo Tulip has the perfect life: she writes an household hints advice column for the newspaper, she's engaged to a handsome business executive, and she lives in her beloved hometown. Until the day of her wedding when she's called to identify the body of her dead neighbor, her fiancé dumps her at the altar, and her column has been cancelled. What's a poor girl to do but find the murderer with her best friend Danny? But Danny's got a secret too: he's in love with Jo. Clark manages to keep all of these storylines interesting and fun. While some of the characters seem a little flat, I'm assuming that they will be fleshed out as the series continues. Clark does a good job of weaving God into the characters' lives without it seeming forced. The plot behind the mystery seemed a little over the top, as did the climax, but Clark handled it well."
3,"Good, but not as intense as some of her other books.","This was a good, lightweight book. I've read Whispers of the Bayou, Secrets of Harmony Grove, the Million Dollar Series, and one more Amish mystery. Loved them all; you can't go wrong with Mindy Starns Clark. It should be duly noted, though, that this series is far more light (has a bit less suspense) than her other books."
5,"Great mystery from another ""Clark""","I bought a copy of this for myself and then another for a friend. This is a cute, fun Christian mystery with some romance and humor thrown in. Since the main character, Jo Tulip, writes a household hints column, you'll want to read this with highlighter in hand to mark all of the great cleaning tips sprinkled throughout the story. Danny Watson may be my new favorite leading man in Christian novels. You'll want to read the other two Smart Chick mysteries. I wish Mrs. Clark would write more!"
3,Easy read,"The Trouble with Tulip is an easy and enjoyable read, but lacked the suspense and character development of Clark's Million Dollar Mysteries series. Hope to see Clark delve a little deeper into the substance of the Smart Chick characters and make the plots increasingly intricate to keep readers involved. Enjoyed the ""helpful hints"" Tulip provided. Go ahead--enjoy some trouble with Tulip!"
5,5 Star Book,I have read all of Mindy Startns Clark books and have loved everyone of them. I can't wait until the next book comes out. A must read book.
4,Decent bar,Not the best tasting bar out there but it is decent. It has a slight peanut butter taste covered in chocolate. If you are dieting it will take your sweet tooth away as this is a very sweet bar. Kashi GOLEAN bars are full of fiber and protien so they do a good job of filling you up. This bar along with a bottle of water makes for a good quick on-the-go meal. Don't expect this bar to knock your socks off. But it is one of the better meal replacement bars out there.
1,Not what i expected,I was expecting a brush that was a little harder. It is so soft i can not use it to brush my goats out
3,Missed Opportunity,"I'm not quite as enthusiastic about this book as the previous two reviewers. The photography is quite competently done, but it primarily focuses on T&C's flora and fauna (including lots of underwater shots). I think there was also a real opportunity to highlight more of T&C's beautiful beaches, some of the great vistas around Chalk Sound, the unique architecture of Cockburn Town, etc. (though I realize the primary focus of the book was on nature). Given the absence of other good ""coffee table books"" about T&C, this is worth getting, but I think there was a real missed opportunity to make this a more ""complete"" view of the various aspects of Turks and Caicos."
1,Don't waste your money.,"10 YEARS AGO I BOUGHT A VERY SIMILULAR BOOT SCRAPER THAT HAD THE SAME MESH MOUNTED ON WOOD. IT WAS A GREAT PRODUCT. THE NEW MODEL SHOWN HERE IS ""CRAP"" THE PLASTIC BASE CRACKED AFTER A FEW WEEKS USE AND THE MESH HAS COME OFF IN SEVERAL AREAS. LOOK FOR A BETTER ITEM THAN THIS. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME, EFFORT AND MONEY$$$"
2,Very basic,"This is an all plastic shoe cleaner. It feels light and insubstantial. Lots of plastic ""fingers"" in the main body of the unit and those are not very effective. This is a basic unit that will do a basic job of superficial shoe cleaning prior to entering the house. It's not very attractive at all. Just OK."
3,Could be better,Item works but is very light weight and flimsey.. Haven't had long enough to comment on durabilty
2,A piece of junk,"This item arrived broken. The brushes are held in place a thin piece of hard plastic. I was not surprised it broke in transit after I could see the quality of the item. Also, to returm the item you have to send an e-mail to get the return instructions. They won't tell you over the phone."
3,on the plastic side,"The bristles seem sturdy enough, but the base is too lightand plastic and not as heavy duty as it should be. Good for light use."
4,2012shopper1,This boot shoe scraper that I ordered from Amazon is everything I wanted. It cleans the bottom and sides. Would be great if I could get my family to use it.
3,Not up to his others. Reuses plot twists.,"While Patterson tells a great story, I was disappointed at the similarity of major plot elements -- read: the solution -- between The Final Judgment and two earlier works, Degree of Guilt and Eyes of a Child. Read those and you'll have a good idea who did it, why, and what motivates the central character to do the things she does."
4,"Another ""who-dunnit"" that keeps you guessing!","Having read Degree of Guilt, Eyes of a Child and Private Screening, The Final Judgement lives up to a publishers expectation of following a thread to develop another best seller. I liked the book because, as with other North Patterson novels, the author develops several suspects with motive, and keeps you guessing until the last of it. Focus on the evidence will lead the reader to the real killer"
2,just alright,It was OK. Did not grab me and keep my attention. Very slow reading. Probably won't buy another like this.
3,This is the only one of his books I've read.,"And here's why. Without giving away the ending, I knew who the killer was about halfway through. I kept going because it is well written, and I was hoping for a shocking surprise at the end. I was disappointed. I read this about 3 years ago and at the time I bought this one, I bought another one of his books. I haven't opened it yet. I'm sorry, Mr. Patterson, but I like to keep guessing until THE VERY LAST PAGE. ""The Final Judgement"" failed in this aspect."
3,Predictable. Average at best.,"Another beach book and easy, entertaining reading for middle America. Patterson easily engages the reader, but lacks depth with this story. No surprises here--I guessed correctly the identity of the killer at the beginning of the book."
5,Non si può interromperne la lettura,"Il libro di Patterson è avvincente. Non capita spesso di trovare romanzi che ti ""catturano"" fin dalle prime pagine e che non si possono più abbandonare fino alla risoluzione finale. L'unico personaggio a mio parere non ben delineato (o da me poco capito) è il vecchio Channing. Leggerò volentieri altri romazi dell'autore"
1,Another dreadful formulaic tabloid thriller,"I made the serious mistake of reading this straight after a real novel, James Ellroy's 'The Cold Six Thousand'.I could scarcely believe how bad The Final Judgement was in comparison. I had hoped it would be a lightweight but competent holiday read. Instead it was full of the most tedious and contrived characterisation married to a silly and self-conscious plot. I was very disappointed given the gushing praise on the jacket (who are these people?!).More and more it seems as if there are hardly any excellent thriller writers around today and the publishing industry is pushing books which barely make the readable grade, like this piece of nonsense. I will never again go within 100 yards of a Richard North Patterson book."
1,No show!,"The book was never received. Contacted the book company thru Amazon.Com. They sent me an e-mail awhile later saying they had sent it, but was out of town when it was returned. Still do not understand why it was returned. They said they would send it again, and it still has not been received. Amazon.Com,, refunded me the full amount. Have ordered books from many book dealers, and this is the first time I never received one. Do not plan to order from this dealer again."
1,Brett is a woman?,"Of all the thousands of feminine names, the author chose ""Brett"" for the female star of the book.... It messed with my mind every time I picked it up until I finally put the book down, for good, after about 30 pages."
4,My final judgement... good airplane or summer reading.,"This book is tightly written with most subplots fleshed out and resolved (which means Patterson has a good editor!). My only negative comment is the number of ""twists"" in this book. To me incredulity is strained to the point that the characters no longer matter and the reader is reduced to appreciating the writing style. That is what happened to me in this book. I love the writing, but so much ""other stuff"" was going on, that I lost touch with the main story line.Bottom line - Mr. Patterson sold a book... I got to meet one of his recurring characters (Caroline Masters) and learned a little about how life runs in different social circles (I think he describes Martha's Vineyard incredibly well). It's not going on the shelf as a keeper, but I will pass this book on with a recommendation to read it. Good luck to all!"
3,"The book was fine, the audio version I did not enjoy",I found the reader on the audio terribly distracting. She sounded affected and her words slurppy. I recommend reading the book but not listening to the audio.
2,Too much music,"If you are looking for wave sounds only u had better keep looking, this one is definitely not the one!"
5,Very Relaxing,"This is one of the few CDs you'll ever hear me play in my apartment, as I like to respect my neighbors around me. I also play this CD whenever I have guests over as I'm cooking dinner... just to make their stay more relaxing and welcome. It is absolutely like being surrounded with a breath of fresh air, and I never get bored with it."
3,rec2 is good,"this was actually a good little 80 minute film.I was surprised by the demonic transformation and the way the devil used a kid to spurt out the ""c"" word to a priest who was in with the swat guys.Its a little more gruesome than the first but never the less enjoyable little outing."
1,Terrible,"So instead of an outbreak of a virus or bacterial infection, apparently these hordes of zombies are caused by demonic possession. So stupid I could barely finish watching it. The first one was great. I enjoyed it immensely even though I had watched the American version (Quarantine) first."
5,great quality,"I am very,very pleased with REC 2.awesome movie that picks up right where the first one left off.The quality of the dvd is MINT condition and the speed in which i received it astonishing! I look forward to doing more buisness with you in the future and to everyone out there ,i,highly recommend this company."
3,Great,Really good movie..I had seen part one but this one was also as good. I recommend this movie it was AWESOME!
5,good quality,"I ordered this movie for my son, and have not heard any complaints. It is just what he asked for."
3,Great Film Rec2,"I enjoyed this DVD. I originally went to see at the an Indie movie theater her in Dallas. I love the concept of starting with one camera perspective, then going to a second, then combining then again. My only complaint is:I have newer DVD player that is a Sony/Blue Ray. My television is also a Sony so they mesh well. My friend tried to watch this and his TV and DVD player come from different manufacturers. He could not get the subitles in English to work. I had to adjust the screen size to see the subtitles. Why don't they make a English version that doesn't rely on this annoying technology. Just dub in the English. No offense the Spanish version but I would estimate that a majority of the viewers are English speaking and would appreciate this."
5,Still better then most horror movies!,This time they tell us a little more about the origin of the infection...interesting spin! The picture quality is well as is the sound. Plays on standard dvd player. I can only hope for a part three with the Church being more involved this time around and the infection spreading!
3,Lord Peter's Incomplete Stories,This product is misrepresented as the complete Lord Peter Wimsey Stories. This it is not! I originally bought it thinking it was a series of volumes including the full length novels of Lord Peter. It is in fact The Complete Short Stories .......Having said all this it is worth having as it collects all the short stories in one volume. If you like Dorothy Sayers you will like these not so short stories which include some fascinating plots.
2,Lord Peter incomplete,"I was disappointed that this book was not thecomplete Lord Peter Whimsey as the title states. There are no longer stories, only little short ones. I was looking for the stories with Harriet Vane,""Clouds of Whitness"", "" Whose Body"" and so on. This book was not the complete stories of Lord Peter by a long run."
5,Fascinating peak into mid-1900's British high-society.,"Each story is self-contained, but there is progression.Lord Peter himself, and most of the other characters are self-efacingly described in a very endearing way.The plot twists are mostly ""high-brow"" and often quite technical. Especially impressive the the female author of her time period so astutely describes such stereotypically manly things such as motorcycle enthusiasts, smoking-room society, poker playing, etc."
1,It does not fully recline it doesn't change positions at all I bought it because it said it would go in 3 prositions. Not,I would not have bought this at all if I had know that it does not fully recline or move at all like it said it would...
3,Amazing ..,"The Ahmadiyya Movement was established in 1889 by Hadhrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908) in a small and remote village, Qadian, in the Punjab, India. He claimed to be the expected reformer of the latter days, the Awaited One of the world community of religions. The Movement he started is an embodiment of the benevolent message of Islam -- peace, universal brotherhood, and submission to the Will of God -- in its pristine purity. Hadhrat Ahmad proclaimed Islam as the future religion of man.Ahmadi Muslims (Believers of Mirza Ahmad ) believe that Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (RA) is promissed missiah who born in Qadian India. One of his book name is ""Masih Hindustan Main"" or ""Messiah in India "", now it is amazing to find another book with similar name written by western writer. I will write in detail after reviewing this book."
5,classic,"What more can be said about this timeless classic. Richard Kiley's best, I saw him in the original on Broadway, what a keepsake. People who see this show don't usually go once, they go 3-5-7 times."
2,very disapointing,"I love the songs as I heard them on the radio and at the Blacksone theatre in 1968,but not this recording.This recording is terrible."
3,"Without Joan Diener, it would be fantastic","Joan Diener was married to the director of Man of La Mancha, Albert Marre, so there essentially was no competition for the role of Aldonza. Thererfore, what we get is a screeching, vituperative voice that rankles the ears. I have the utmost admiration for Richard Kiley, though I wish the rendition of 'The Impossible Dream' was recorded with more passion and orchestrated with more style as it is one of my favorite Broadway songs. All in all a good album, but with the glaring casting error of Diener."
1,Poor choice,I purchased this CD because I have been unable to locate the London production perfomed around the same time. This CD pales in comparison. With luck I may find someone who can enjoy this rendition. Does anyone know where I can find a CD of the London performance?
3,"Good pan, poor handle","This pan is well made (like most KitchenAid products) and functions well as a large non-stick pan.As a skillet, it is difficult to use because the handle is inadequate for the weight of the pan. The handle is too narrow, making it difficult to tilt the pan. The upward angle of the handle also makes it harder to use. It's not unusable, just puts more pressure on your hand than a better designed handle would.My previous skillet, the 10"" calphalon, had a perfect handle."
3,Decent pan but non stick coming off,Had pan a year and the non stick is coming off. My Circulon and WearEver are still going strong and I've had them longer. I may send it back for a new one if it's worth the cost to mail. I gave 25$ for it. Kitchen Aid makes good products and I have many of them but this pan is a bit weak on the coating. I never have had long term success with non stick anyway so for the dollars I don't really feel put off.
3,All good writers have a better editor.,"This is a wonderful book for academicians to use for research on a little known and less understood culture of the middle ages. It is full of very good and accurate information. But, it is seriously flawed in that it needs a good editing. If the publishers are considering a second printing, I hope they will first submit the manuscript to a professional editor."
2,Strong Content But Lacking In Presentation,"I hate to give a book that contains such a wealth of information, such a low rating. However, there are many problems with this book that make it necessary. To begin with, the writing is very dry which makes it difficult to read, although it does improve later in the book. I also didn't care much for the organization. Lastly, the font used is small, and this makes it all the more difficult to read for any length of time. If you are studying the Cathars, then this is undoubtedly a good book to have as a reference. However, this is not a good book for reading about the subject, especially if you are looking for an introduction to the topic."
4,credo,"We were so happy we could find another cd on Jennifer Rush; her voice is so smooth and so powerful, it's always a pleasure to be able to listen to another great performence by this artist."
4,So far so good,"Ordered this for our cat after his 2nd bladder stone surgery in under a year. I mix it in his wet food and he doesnt seem to notice, and he is a fairly picky eater. Hopefully this will help keep him out of the surgery room for awhile anyway."
5,An awakening for the soul,Struck by Lightning was both fascinating and educating. It is a battle of good vs. evil and how faith and love can conquer. Mike Curley is very descriptive and detailed in his writing style which allows the reader to really picture what is happening. I thoroughly enjoyed this story and could hardly put the book down.
2,FRUSTRATING: Very BUGGY,"I'm a wargamer from way back -- enjoyed playing this one to a degree, agree with the other reviewer about lack of solid AI and replayability..boring. Most importantly, IT ALWAYS LOCKED UP ON ME IN THE CAMPAIGN GAME! Not just locked up, froze my Pentium 4 XP latest patch/drivers computer SOLID. In fact, I'm writing the review just after putting the darn thing on E-bay for re-sale. I'm done with it and won't buy anything from Russian programmers again!"
3,pc game,i am having problems getting the program to run well on my pc. i have been in contact with the company and they are helping to resolve the proble.
3,Redundant,"After the initial glow wore off, it was apparent that there is very limited replayability here. The canned 'random' missions are essentially the same over and over again, and the historical missions are identical every time. A branching campaign as in Panzer General 2 would have been infinitely more interesting."
2,bugs and more dumb bugs!,"irksome and tiresome the novelty of the spectacular wears thin.. for after awhile you realise, your clicking has no real meaning or consequence..... the bugs have noo inteligence they just rush en mass and wish to destroy you, and the game gives you nO REAL control, no player SENCED inteligence , just a feeling everything is scripted and you feel cheated."
2,"expensive, play time of only 28 minutes","I bought the following CDs:1. Multiplication unplugged, $11.99, 73 minutes play timeOut of these 3 CDs, this one is, by far, the best quality and value. 5 stars.2. Multiplication Intelli-tunes by Ron Brown.$14.99, 28 minutes - 2 stars3. Multiplication Hip Hop $13.99, 31 minutes - 1.5 stars"
5,Lovelier than expected,"These plates are wonderful looking--great color--a real pleasure to look at and eat from. I didn't expect anything this terrific, especially at the low price I paid."
3,"Sweet, sweet illustrations","Stella's Dancing Days is the story of a young kitten who loves to dance... until she grows older and has kittens of her own, who in turn are born with a love of dancing. This sweet story of Stella the cat's interaction with all the humans in her life will delight young children as they envision a cat doing grands jetes and pirouettes. The illustrations, by Kathryn Brown will draw young readers in as they envision the story of this fanciful cat.~DeeDee Fox, Author of The Ruby Red Slippers"
4,Good book,"Is what I was looking for. It is a Godly way to talk about sex. Even though you don't want to, Haveing a Godly base makes it easier."
3,A Christian Approach,"Be aware that this book takes a highly Christian approach to discussing sex. While much of the advice--especially the real-life scenarios--are great, the book focuses on abstinence (pg 190 includes ""How to tell if your school's sex education curriculum effectively teaches true abstinence"") and prayer (""Situations like these [when your child becomes sexually active] remind us of the central importance of prayer during a crisis....pray for...God to hem your child in...."" Total abstinence until marriage is not, in my opinion, a healthy sexual (or mental) choice. Parents who want to discuss sex with their children in a frank and non-Christian way (ie ""kids, sometime in the distant future, but before you are married, you may choose to have sex...."") should choose a different book."
1,Absolutely worthless,"The worst book I have ever bought. The writing is horrible and the content is absolutely useless. I couldn't even finish it, for it was so painful."
1,"Thanks, but no Thanks.","No matter how you explain it, this track is hideous and the lack of talent on every level beams through like the sun. I personally would not spend money on this. Her voice is like chalk on a board & this is not some of Chris Cox's best work either, sorry."
5,Sophisticated Storytelling,This is a wonderful independent film. A very refreshing addition to independent films being made today. This is a great interpretation of life during the Depression in the Southern U.S. This film is for those who enjoy the art of intellectual filmmaking. Bravo to the film. Highly recommended.
4,Great toy for young children,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 3 yr old cousin. She LOVES to hide things and find them, so I thought this was perfect. Out of everything she got, she played with this the entire day. I recommend this toy for any child who likes to play hide and seek. Hours of fun!"
2,worth a try,"I really wanted to love the monkey, but it really isn't made very well. I didn't have any problems with the monkey falling apart; it just doesn't work. It seemed to work well the first 2 times, but then the wand had to be right next to the monkey to pick up any signals. We changed the batteries in both the monkey and the wand twice. The boys still think it's fun to make the wand light up but they can't play ""hide and seek"" with it so it sits in the closet taking up space. It's disappointing."
2,A lot of fun right up until it died...,"Purchased this for my nine year old daughter for Christmas. We had quite a bit of fun playing with it for an hour or so on Christmas day. When she and her friends wanted to play several days later, the Monkey had died and would not emit its high frequency sound. After changing its battery (there is no positive motion power switch, only a red button with no indication that it is powered off) and the batteries in the wand, we tried it again. The monkey would emit a very low power signal, so low that the only way to detect it is to hold the wand directly over the speaker port. It appears that the high frequency sound amplifier in the monkey is bad, rendering the toy useless. Very disappointed in the durability of what was otherwise a pretty promising toy. Unfortunately, can't return it as the packaging was thrown out with all the Christmas wrapping."
1,Sound did not work!!,"My kids received this toy and were not that interested in it. The only indicator that you are approaching the monkey is the lights on the stick - which makes it annoying and difficult. Upon reading these reviews, I am finding that our monkey must be broken! The sound never worked! I wouldn't have known it even had sound, because there are insufficient directions that come with the product. Thumbs down."
1,Product did not work,I was very disappointed. I purchased the Hide and Seek Safari-Monkey for my nieces and it did not work. I'll be returning it as soon as I get it back from them.
1,ZERO stars...save your money!,"I rely heavily on reviews prior to purchasing something, so I knew I would be gambeling when I bought this. However, I figure with three monkeys and 6 wands, at least one would work. WRONG!I bought one for my two boys, my three neices, and my other sister's girl. My mother in law purchased extra wands so that all 6 kids could play.The idea behind the product is GREAT. I would pay 2x the price for one that actually worked because all of these kids love hide n seek. Not a single pair would work though. We tried every wand with every monkey. Some would give a very faint signal when you were about 1 foot from it, other didn;t even light up.One monkey was about 1 hour out of the box when my niece (about 2 1/2 foot tall) dropped it on the carpet and the arm broke off.What a dissapointment!Save your money!"
2,Hide and Seek Monkey,My grandson enjoyed finding him in the trees and bushes although the wand doesn't sound off unless you areright ontop of it.
2,Waste of money,"The first one I bought didn't work at all, so I had to exchange it. The second one worked, but in order for the wand to make any sound you have to be right in front of the monkey, almost touching it. I expected the want to guide you to the monkey when you enter the room, but that's not the case - you have to be so close it defeats the whole purpose and no fun. My 4.5 year old daughter lost interest very quickly..."
1,Thought it was great idea but it never worked!!,I got this for my kids because they love to play hide-and-seek. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. The wand is supposed to light up and beep as you get closer to the the monkey. But it kept emitting the same high pitch sound and flashing the same lights regardless of how far or close we got to the monkey. I kept trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. Then I read the reviews and found other people had the same problem.
2,disappointed,I read some good reviews on this toy and since my grandsons are monkey crazy - I thought it would be a great buy. We bought the extra wand too. You have to be on top of the toy with the monkey turned the exact right way to be able to find the signal.The boys lost interest right away due to the poor performance.
1,DON'T BE TEMPTED TO BUY THIS!,"The idea of this toy sounds like so much fun, but don't be tempted to order it! I ordered it along with an extra set of wands for my grandchildren, but it didn't work even once. We changed the batteries, but that didn't help. Such a disappointment."
1,Hid and Seek Monkey,This game is a piece of junk. I called the manufacturer when the game stopped working after we played with it 6 times. They did not take responsiblity for this defective game. The monkey stops making noise and the wand lights do not always go on. We have changed the batteries after 2 uses. The game is defective and should not be sold.Our grandchildren also have the same game at their house and it also has the same problems. Take it off the market is my advise.Thank you
1,Monkey,This toy never worked. We tried all of the tips that came with the toy to fix the problem but it still doesn't work at all. Unfortunately it was a Christmas gift so the packaging was destroyed that morning or I would have returned it. Seemed like it would have been a fun toy if it would have worked.
1,Menos el Oso........Uggghh,I don't know what else to say about the new album other than I feel extremely let down. I have been a Minus the Bear fan for a very long time and I've thought every release up unitl Menos el Oso were great. Highly Refined Pirates is one of my favorite albums and to have this be the follow up LP is a definate downer.I can honestly say the only song that I really like is Hooray. Every other song is just boring and monotonous.
2,Not as good as the first,"I really enjoyed the first book in this series, so I was really disappointed at how much I disliked the second book.In the first book, it made sense why Maggie would involve herself in the murder. In this book, it made no sense at all. And it made even less sense that should would involve herself in ways that put her in so much danger, such as following suspects up mountain roads by herself, breaking into suspect's homes and businesses, and confronting suspects face to face with no backup.I also found her personality especially annoying in this book compared to the previous one. I kept wondering why Villari didn't lock her in a cell and toss away the key...for good.I haven't found any more books in this series...if there are more, I hope I enjoy them as much as the first one, or I'll cut this series off sooner rather than later. This one was just painful to finish."
3,Ok but not great,The book was ok but I felt there were too many story lines to really enjoy the book. Some stories took up more time than others so although I didn't hate the book I didn't really enjoy it either.
2,very conservative in the approach with supplements,"this book disapointed me as a therapist because the knoledge in this book is interpreted to the recommandation of around the r.d.a wich is an old sad joke. there are however a certain thing in the term of knoledge that are basically fine, but in the overall recommandation is alternativly concervative=not practical in dealing with serious diseases"
5,Hugh Dillon Rules,"I love it when I seen a band play live and it sounds just like the CD. That's exactly the case with Picture of Health. Lead singer Hugh Dillon's snarl and ferocity come through completely intact on this album. The music is dark, sad, fast and very agressive. The cover of Tweeter and the Monkeyman is fantastic. This is one of the hardest working bands in Canada and it shows in their albums and in their live shows."
1,tragically Hip?,Only for the actual presance of a guitar this bads sounds like a ripoff of tragically HIp with the same dying goat vocals. Call this album Tribute to the HIP: Revenge Of The Goat.
1,Curb does it again,Everyone please realize that LeAnn did not authorize this album even though Curb is her record company. This is the second time Curb has gone behind her back and released an album without her input. The music on this album is outstanding! The music gets 5 stars. Curb gets 0 stars. LeAnn is working on her own album but with Curb in the way she isn't able to release it. Don't judge LeAnn based on these songs. Some were recorded many years ago. LeAnn has grown as an artist since then and should be judged on what she is doing NOW. LeAnn is one of my favorite artists and THAT is why I will not buy this album. Shame on you Curb. Why not treat your artists with respect?
5,Family Listening,"It's wonderful to know there are still songs that uphold what is right and good in America. I can't believe there are people who don't like this album even though it may be some of her older songs. There are a couple of new gospel songs that are very uplifting,especially Sands of Time. This album is very much worth the time and money. C.T"
2,Old Recordings Rehashed Into A New CD.,"Very disappointing, It's just old recordings rehashed onto a new CD and I heard that LeAnn who is a wonderful singer didn't even have any say about this CD being released! Also there aren't enough patriotic songs! I really hope that LeAnn makes a new CD of all newly recorded Patriotic songs and another one that is all Inspirational Gospel songs!"
3,God Bless LeAnn,"The release of this album leaves everybody wondering about the motives behind Curb releasing it in the first place. The front cover of the album itself leaves alot to be desired. The picture is as old as the recordings of the songs.There aren't many country albums that can't find themselves in my CD player, but I am not sure how many people are going to be happy to pump up the volume on this album. Don't get me wrong, LeAnn Rimes is one of the most talented people to emerge on the music scene. But this CD is the exception.God Bless LeAnn. Curb is out to ruin her."
4,Bigger IS better,Shogo is one of my favorite games and thats saying alot since Im not much of a fan of first person shoot 'em ups.the game can be played several different ways at first... no probably should'nt tell you what happens. anyway its got choices that determine the outcome of the game. each person has at least 12 gallons of blood though so if you dont like blood this is not your game. I think it will be fun for anime fans and new comers alike.
4,So much potential...,"First off, I really enjoyed playing Shogo but I was left wanting. The game has much growing room. I found the game particularly unstable and highly prone to crash. The story was cheesy, even for a comic book. As has been pointed out before, who came up with this rather pathetic attempt at a translation? The game was also a little bit too easy, can we say predictable AI? When will someone come up with a baddy that won't just stand there while you shoot him if he can't see you? You gotta love the weapons, ya just can't beat a good sniper rifle!"
1,Wishing it would work in my DVD player!!,"Thus Dvd was a present for my mother, it just won't work in any Dvd player we have, I sent the original back and Amazon graciously gave me another one, itjust will not work!! Amazon even gave me back my money. I don't know if this particular type of Dvd just won't play in any of my players or my neighbors or my mom's.I am bummed out because my mother loves Rod Stewart and at this point just don't know what to do!!"
2,Zzzzzzzzzzz,"Rod may be an icon in the Rock genre, but his first attempt at lounge music is an overwhelming bore. The voice that works so well for Maggie May shoes itself to be inadequate for these classic melodies. Everything sounds fine, but uninspired and unexciting."
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,THE MAGIC ROD WEAVES IN THIS VIDEO WILL ABSOLUTELY MELT YOUR HEART!!! NOT ONLY IS HE AN ARTIST BUT HE BRINGS WITH HIM THE TALENT OF MANY OTHER YOUNG ARTISTS AND THIS GIVES HIM A 10STAR SALUTE. HE IS JUST WHAT WE NEED AS A CATALYST TO BRING REAL MUSIC TO THE FOREFRONT. YOU JUST GOT TO LOVE HIM.!!! I PRAY ONE DAY SOON HE'LL PLAY VEGAS TO WOW MUSIC LOVERS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE. ONLY HE CAN DO IT ALL!!!GOD BLESS HIM AND CLIVE DAVIS FOR MAKING IT ALL HAPPEN! MY LOVE AND THANKS TO YOU BOTH JC
1,CD didn't play,I never got to listen to this CD. Both copys I received were not playable. I will re-order and try to get a copy that works.
4,It Had To Be You,Good video overview of Rod Stewart's body of work with an emphasis on the American songbook music.This is Rod Stewart in concert on video.If you like the singers later music you will enjoy the video because it is more relaxed and mellow with very little Rock.
4,Fun and nostalgic,Rod Stewart's casual style makes a truly entertaining gift of old favorites with a mix of his hits.
3,Half and Half,"For the half of the show where Rod and the band sing the songs which made Rod famous - 5 stars. For the half of the show where Rod and an orchestra sing songs which made other singers famous - 2 stars. We found the latter part quite bland, almost boring. The 5.1 audio and the video was excellent. Good to buy only if you're a real Rod Stewart fan."
4,Beautiful.....peaceful,Great to sail through dream cloudsit is worth the listening.I do recommend this music andbelieve you will enjoy as I do.
3,Dog Treats,"As a treat these were just too small,it should be labeled for toy and small dogs.Gracie was not happy with just one,size of a lifesaver.I would not purchase these again."
2,Beefy Bites (made from beef lungs) from Smokehouse,"My picky eater of a dog likes most of the Smokehouse brand dog treats but these? Not so much....in fact when he got a whiff of them, he quickly turned the other way...same reaction I had when I unscrewed the top...they DO smell awful."
2,For really really young kids,"I bought this and thought it wasn't a good deal for the price. Moreover, it is not for any child over three, which people should know before they buy it.BootsO'Rourke"
4,"Interesting Format, Fascinating Reading","The book uses a day-by-day approach to the story, quoting and paraphrasing first-hand references--diaries and reports of people on the scene. I found it very readable and interesting. Lots of good info and tidbits.One complaint--and for me a big one--NO INDEX. It should be against the law to publish an historical book like this with no index. This makes it difficult to use as as serious reference work."
3,"OK, but......","Not so bad for a first book, at least it is readable even when a little confusing. The author isn't really interested in his characters, picks them up and drops them without much explanation. The books doesn't come to a conclusion, it just ends. It is hard to understand the characters, they are stick figures and need more flesh. Of course, when I read the senior Theroux's books, I never really understand why he does anything, either. They seem to want to share their views of the world, but nothing of themselves. This is true of all of Paul Theroux's book, including my favorite, his trip through China in the Iron Rooster. Seems to be true of the son, also. If the main character reflects the author, I get the feeling he feels out of step with the world, but doesn't much give a damn about it, preferring to wait until the rest of the world gets in line with him."
4,witty and very enjoyable,"I've just finished reading this book and I love it. For a first novel, Theroux is greatly talented. I found the main character someone that I wanted to help out, because of his confusion most of the time. This book is wonderful, I highly recommend it."
4,Useful but not perfect,"Whether you are studying for the bar or simply trying to survive your first year of law school these flash cards can be an invaluable study aid for the basic topics.Why only 4 stars and not 5? Easy, they are just a little too simplistic. Using them can help you survive, but to thrive you will still have to do a lot of work on your own."
2,Polish Robbin Hoods,I purchsed this book because I remember reading a lot about the Panczko Brothers in the newspapers of the time. I liked the book.
4,Good Price - Good Coffee Maker,"Keeps coffee hotLarge quantity of coffeeCarafe does not dripEasy to fill and cleanEasy controlsFor $50 I got what I wanted and it works well. No complaints... OK, so it looks a little boring, but I don't look at it much!"
1,Leaks + ruined my cabinets,"Well, after 2 weeks it leaks. Set up the machine overnight to make 8 cups and wake up to only 4 cups of water left.Didn't realize it at first but now I have water damage in my cabinets due to not noticing the leaking. Bad ;("
3,Cheap plastic parts breaks easily,"This coffee pot is easy to use, makes decent coffee, and makes more cups than most of the pots you find.However, it is cheaply made. The hinge for the pot lid is shockingly poorly made, out of a teensy plastic piece that popped off after only a couple of gentle months use. Without the top, this coffee pot is useless because the top of the pot tells the coffee maker when to work and and when to stop-if you pick up the pot during brewing it puts the brewing on hold until you replace the pot.The cheapness is very disappointing."
2,Hamilton Beach 43234,"Not totaly happy with this coffeemaker,it work good no problem there but this coffee maker does not bulid for under kitchen cabinets and I spell water everytime try to fill the water tank, before purchase this product check the sample on floor see if fits your needs."
1,NO LIGHT,"I received this yesterday, it's going back today. the pot itself is ok but it has NO light. To see the AM or PM you need a flashlight. It would be nice to be able to see the time when you're in the kitchen. I checked and it doesn't have one, so i didn't receive a defective pot."
3,meh...,"i bought this for work. it brews coffee, but that's it.it is too tall for my cubicle. i can't open the top all of the way without hitting the top bins. so i had to turn it sideways to put water in it.the power cord is all of 1.5 feet long. crap.the moving sprayer means you need perfect coffee filter sizes or it scrunches them all up.it does pour great though. drip free. keeps the coffee hot. tastes pretty good."
1,No Coffee. Feeling Cranky.,"I purchased this item based on all the positive reviews here. It worked OK (not great, but for under $50 I couldn't complain) for three months. But then yesterday it stopped working! I cleaned it, tried it every which way, troubleshooted the problem online. And even though it is technically under warranty, Amazon makes the warranty return policy incredibly obtuse. From now on, I am going to purchase all electronic items from the local Mom & Pop place in town, where this would not be such a headache. I know it;s only $50, but it is frustrating nonetheless."
2,Carafe Hinge Problem,I researched the reviews for coffeemakers quite extensively and decided on the Hamilton Beach 43254 because of cost and fairly good product reviews. Within two weeks of use the carafe hinge that holds the top for pouring had broken.I have spoken with Hamilton Beach and they will replace the carafe - although the consumer representative informed me that the model I purchased had been manufactured in 2009! Two years later I am buying it on Amazon.com. I am pleased with the response from Hamilton Beach but would have rathered the hinge not broken so quickly in the first place. As always I agree buyer beware! and reading the reviews can only get you so far in your selection.
4,Great Coffee Maker,This is a great coffee maker. It's easy to use and has all the features I need. Everyone really likes how it looks. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,The Best!,"After years of buying and eventually rejecting the more expensive, designer and ""sexy"" coffeemakers, decided to approach the problem from a different perspective. Went back to Hamilton Beach, a brand used for 50 years. Things I really like about it - (1) excellent coffee (2) easy to add water and coffee (3) good design to release accumulated steam (unlike the Cuisinart thermal pot unit which dripped down the back when you opened it) (4) a pre-programmed 2-hour heating element (5) very easy to program/reprogram brewing times. Sometimes kitchen appliances are over-engineered and become a pain. Not this one."
5,Best coffee maker I've had!,I love my new coffee maker. It makes a great cup of coffee and I love that I can program it and have my coffers waiting for me when I wake up!
4,works fine,this is a fine coffeemaker. I am not a sophisticated user. Just like strong black coffee and this works fine.
4,Great coffee maker,"Just started drinking coffee and decided to pick up my own coffee maker. I wanted something with more features than just an on/off switch but was still reasonably priced. Compared this between other brands (Mr Coffee, Black and Decker...etc) and thought this was the best bang-for-buck as well as most visually appealing. I've been using it for a few weeks now and so far so good. I haven't used the programmable option much but it's definitely nice to have. A few times I've accidentally poured too much water into the reservoir and water began spilling out of the back from a little slit, which I had no idea was there until then. Overall good coffee maker, does what I want at a reasonable price."
3,"Eh, I'll give this to someone who doesn't drink much coffee","My major gripe is that it produces a weak cup of coffee. I don't think the water gets hot enough to make a nice cup of coffee. The place where you pour the water is OK, but its easy to spill if you're not on target. I was going on the cheap, and in the process blew $35."
2,"Looks nice, but the carafe is terrible.","This coffee maker looks great and has simple easy to understand controls. However, it seems like no one at Hamilton Beach ever tried making coffee with it before they shipped it! Because of a large lip around the inside edge of the carafe, it is very difficult to pour all the water out of the carafe when filling the coffee maker, and very difficult to empty all coffee out of the carafe when cleaning it."
5,Hamilton Beach 43254 12-cup Coffee Maker,"So far this coffee pot has worked great!! I get lots of compliments on how nice it looks. It's easy to use and I got it for a great price. If it had any cons it would be I wish the cord was longer and the lid to the carafe does not stay on well when washing. Other than those minor things, it's a great coffee pot. I would recommend it. I love how it looks on my counter. Not cheap looking at all."
4,Good coffee at good price,"After having a more expensive Cuisinart that made and held coffee without a carafe go caput, I didn't want the expense again so I opted for the much less expensive Hamilton Beach. I am happy with my purchase as the coffee is made quickly and tastes great."
4,Received new and in a timely fashion - thanks!,Received new and in a timely fashion - thanks! Only been able to use it twice but it has worked great both times! Great buy for a basic stainless steel coffee maker!
4,It works,"This is my 2nd Hamilton Beach - It does what you would expect and it does it well - It is easy to use and quick. However, this is my 1st BLACK coffee maker. Unless you have enough bright light it is somewhat difficult to see what you are doing - and it doesn't help that the clock, although illuminated, can not be viewed in a dark room and is not bright enough to be seen from across the room in a well lit room."
2,Worst Tasting Coffee Ever,I don't know if this was a new machine or not but I have run gallons of water through this machine and used the vinegar solution twice and the coffee still tastes bad. Don't know what material they used to make this machine but whatever it is it makes the coffee taste aweful. I can't recommend this coffee maker to anyone except maybe my mother-in-law.
4,hamilton beach 43254,"I did considerable research for a new coffee maker. I narrowed it down to this one and the cuisinart. Chose this one because it had what I wanted, a simple machine with a timer,and not a lot of other bells and whisltes. Also my previous one was a Hamilton beach and it lasted a long time. Have had it a couple of months and it works good. Easy to use, not a lot of bells and whistles, and it looks ok. I would recommend this product."
1,Product Failure Problems,"This is our second Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker. 43254Hamilton Beach 43254 Classic Stainless 12 Cup Coffeemaker, Black.The unit has failed within one month.Hamilton Beach wants $15.99 to ship a replacement unit and wants us to ship them the power cord from the defective unit!!Steam comes out the top and the front of the unit, fogging the LCD clock and turning it black (such that it is difficult to read). You can get coffee out of the unit if you ""whack"" it every 15 seconds or so. It now consistently fails every time we make coffee.Hamilton Beach 43254 Classic Stainless 12-Cup Coffeemaker"
2,Disappointed,"I was looking so forward to getting this coffeemaker, after reading all the wonderful reviews. On the first morning of use, I poured a cup of coffee and it literally poured out from under the black plastic liner at the top-no small leak, coffee was everywhere. I called HB and they said sometimes bubbles form in the glass and that will cause leakage. So, they offered to send me a new carafe-but they were all backordered until??? Two weeks went by, I called again, still backordered until??? Apparently, all parts are made in China (according to the customer service rep), so who knows when they will be in? Until then, I'm left pouring my cups of coffee over the sink. Not fun...and this was my first 'pricier' coffeemaker purchase. Quite disappointed."
2,Cheap,The lid on the pot does not stay on and the hinge on the lid does not snap into place; seems to be poor quality. I have had it less than a year and it is leaking coffee. It seems the quality of products is getting worse.
2,Just not hot enough,"I read the reviews and bought this model for one reason only. Several reviewers said it made hot, hot coffee. It does not. It makes warm coffee like most all drip coffee makers. Don't buy this if you want a hot cup of coffee. Our old Cuisinart broke after many years and I was hoping to replace it with a less expensive model. I've already returned this HB model and will try again with another."
5,Truly a no drip coffee maker,This is our second one. Our old one lasted for years with daily use. Had to search for the exact one again but so worth the time spent.
2,poorly designed carafe,"The carafe shipped with our recent order of this product is very poorly designed. The lid is very difficult to get off because it snaps in firmly,without a design to easily remove it for washing. The brackets that held it on broke off before we even used it the first time (we were getting it ready for the dishwasher). I've had so many coffee pots over the years, and never had one designed like this. I'm sure they change the supplied carafes over the years, but this is not a good one! So we never even got to the point of trying the coffee."
3,not so hot,it seems to be well designd easy to fill but coffee is only 156 degrees not quite hot enough i microwave it 22 seconds to get it hot enough
4,Hamilton Beach Ensemble Coffeemaker,"Very satisfied with this product. It performs as advertised and produces good coffee. Generally convenient to use, except that one must be careful when filling with water to avoid splashes. Timer works satisfactorily."
5,I Love Mine,"We've had percolator coffee makers for the last several years, but after trying to get the last three ~$50 percs to last more than a year, we gave up. We bought this HB coffee maker based on reviews here and elsewhere and have been very pleased with it. The timer works great for us. The pot hasn't dripped or leaked a drop unlike a B&D model we had. The coffee still tastes great after 6 months use and we love it. We have recommended it to friends."
4,for a cheap coffee maker it's great,"I paid [...] bucks for this machine at Target (it was on sale). I melted the cord of my old Mr. Coffee. My old coffee maker required that I microwave the coffee not long after I poured it. This machine makes coffee nice and HOT! Just that fact makes a much better cup of coffee! One could go and pay [...] bucks for some fancy machine but for the price this machine does the job! Also, I've never had a coffee maker that you could set to automatically brew and I have to say that feature made me very happy this morning when I woke up and had piping hot coffee awaiting me...Maybe I'm used to having cheap coffee makers so whatever flaws people are talking about I haven't noticed."
4,Great looking,"This is a great loking coffee maker, especially in a stainless appliancce kitchen. It works good and makes good coffee but after about 9 months of regular use it quit working. Now we were not ""cleaning"" it each month with the vinagar sitting then brewing several times. My husband was able to take it apart and clean heating coils and it is working again now. It is not made clear enough, in my opinion, use must clean this coffee maker monthly using their recommeded method."
3,Leaves a little to be desired,"No complaints about the coffee, just complaints about the design and features. These may annoy you as they annoy me:1) the lid is too long. When opened, the thing is almost 2' tall. This coffee maker cannot be kept under cabinets. It's ridiculous.2) The unit turns off after 2 hours. It does not reset when you remove and replace the pot like other makers do.3) The pot does not go into the base easily; the basket's spring is a bit of an obstacle.4) The power cord is short.It's an ok coffee maker, but I wouldn't recommend this one."
2,works however....,I just purchased this coffee maker ( not from amazon) however if your interested in a cup of coffee which tastes good dont purchase this one.I tried all combinations of making it stronger with a few different coffees and my old mr coffee ( which leaked...hence the replacement) made a much better tasting cup of coffee.
5,Still Dripping,"I bought this coffee maker for My Son who was in Afghanistan for a Year. It made on the average of 5 pots of coffee a Day. When He returned, He left it for the New guys that came to take over. It is still going!! Who says You have to pay big dollars for 5 star quality! Not on this Product!Hamilton Beach 43254 Ensemble 12-Cup Coffeemaker with Glass Carafe, Black"
2,BEWARE not heating after drip,I bought this maker after my other failed less than a year ago . Now it does not heat after the drip is over what good is that. I cant get a refund or return it or even get it fixed.
2,It's doesn't make HOT coffee,"I chose this coffee maker after the positive reviews and good experience with another Hamilton Beach coffee maker. I bought it in September 2011 and it's no longer making hot coffee. Warm, yes, but not hot enough to really get all the flavor and caffeine out of the grinds. The only way to get hot coffee is to let the hot plate heat it up but that doesn't solve the problem. It's a shame because otherwise it's great. It's a good value and sleek-looking. I probably just got a defective one since everyone else seems to like theirs. Oh well."
1,Weak coffee,I love the look and small counter footprint of this coffee maker but it just doesn't make a good cup of coffee. I find that I have to use more coffee to get the same strength brew compared to my old Mr Coffee. I opened the top while it was brewing and discovered that the hot water sprays off to the sides and doesn't cover all the coffee in the basket leaving the edges almost dry when finished. Very inefficient and disappointing.
3,Mama said......,"Mom always said one will get what they pay for. Hamilton Beach was affordable and the little maker did its thing well for one year but now it is time to move up. After the plastic piece on the top of the carafe broke for the second time, we are ready to step it up to a coffee maker that is built to last more than a year. Price was great, performance above average but durability....not so much! Thanks for the morning memories as we are going back to the more expensive and dependable coffee makers on the market. After all, who has the patience in the morning to deal with an average java maker. Not me!"
2,No kid commercials.,"The commercials are all adult: lots of alcohol, cigarettes and coffee. I was hoping for more commercials for kids, because I was a young kid in the '70's. Where were the Boo Berry ads?"
1,Terrible,Please do not use this for your hydroponic reservoir! Phosphoric acid is terrible and will cause a reaction that promotes massive slime growth. Use sulphuric acid (battery acid sold at most automotive supply stores).
1,Why'd you take out the best part????,"Someone decided to destroy the drum break in the beginning of ""Don't Change Your Love"". Don't bother buying it, if you're looking for the drum break. It's obvious that this edit was done out of greed and not out of the preservation of good music. To whoever edited this song... You should have left the drum break!!! I'd give zero stars if I could- just out of frustration."
5,THIS IS ONLY FOR THE SEXY PEOPLE !!!!!!!!!,I AM A THIRTY ONE YEAR OLD WOMAN THAT WAS INTRODUCED TO THIS ALBUM OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO. AND AS GOD AS MY WITNESS I CAN NOT BELIEVE THE SUPERB SPLENDOR OF THIS CD. MY MOTHER GREW UP ON THIS CD WHEN SHE DATED MY DAD. EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS HOT TO DEF. I AM IN AWE OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S VOICES ON THIS ALBUM. THIS ALBUM IS UP THERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON'S THRILLER . AND YES I AM DEAD SERIOUS ABOUT THAT.THIS ALBUM IS A MASTER PIECE.
4,Good Solid Collection,this is long overdue.the Five Stairsteps were a Strong-Self-Contained Unit.there own Instrumentation&SoulFul Sounds.Many Other Family Acts get Props&RightFully so but the Five StairSteps Deserve to Be Mentioned with the Other whose Who of Family Acts.once you here there SoulFul Vibe&Grooves then you will know why.
2,I am not sure?,The samples sounds so digital electronic with modern echo I wonder if it really sounds this way? I am a big stereo fan and not a fan of making such classics songs of Curtis sound this way. The original album posted on here sounds right. These new mixes are so maximized with all this digital artifacts. Maybe its just the samples posted. Any info would be appreciated.
4,I find it helpful in our homeschooling,"We do a thematic literature approach to homeschooling and I love it when I can find books that bring in science to our studies. We find this series especially helpful. It doesn't go into deep detail, only a general overview, but is a good starting point when studying Ancient Greece. I also like to include ""Archimedes and the Door of Science,"" ""Aristotle and Scientific Thought,"" and ""Classical Kids"" which includes a lot of Greek science projects."
3,Breakfast in paris,The quality of the picture wasn't as good as was expected though it never spoilt the film for me. I enjoyed the storyline very much.
5,GREAT MUSICAL COMEDY!!!!!,This Milestone presentation is a great quality splice-free print. No issues. Leo Carrillo is great as an opera-loving Mexican bandit who wants to be more like American gangsters.
1,Does not work,This kind of TDK dvd-rw does not work with my sony camcorder and my computer also cannot format the disc.Maybe my camcorder requires the discs that have the same name.
3,OK,"OK lookingcomfortablebut hard to insert my skinny feet into the narrow neck (even though there's a band connection, it's not streching out much)"
4,good product,"as advertised was looking for cream product that came in a jar, this product flaked and was soft, but did last"
3,Shark DVD,"This ""movie"" (more like a documentary) was made before ""Jaws"" (early 1970's) and is VERY disappointing. It's more like seeing the preparation and the search for sharks and you don't see the shark until almost the end. I do not recommend this at all, and there are many other shark DVD's that are so much better. Don't waste your money."
3,Dig the dirty funky beats..,"Listen to the track samples above.. there's some really good stuff on here. I can't say it's a must-have, but if you're in to collecting good music like I am (that few others on the block have) then you do need to get this. There's some really funky stuff on here... there's also some really interesting spoken-word stuff. In total, there's 3 or 4 tracks that I really like.. the rest I could do without.Right then,Scot"
4,The Music Made the Movie,"Well I'm a piano fanatic and the finale caused me to order, for the second time in my life, a sound track. I had to buy used since the originals seem to be gone. The CD lived up to my expectations. Excellent composition and theme."
5,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I was apprehensive to buy this game. The idea of another Hack & Slash game on the market was like nails on a chalkboard to me. But, I've never played anything like this before. This game took my breath away! It took me two days to tear myself away from this game...and a lot of resistance not to call in sick at work. The story and action move smoothly, and the increased speed in movement is a definite enhancement compared to its predecessor, Baldur's Gate. It is difficult to write this review without giving spoilers. I will just end by saying, if you didn't buy this game for some of the same reasons, I almost didn't. Or, if you didn't buy it because you thought it would be filler between Baldur's Gate and Shadows of Amn, YOU ARE MISSING OUT! This game is incredible. Luckily, I'm a die-hard Pen & Paper RPGer and R.A. Salvatore fan or I would have missed out on this experience. This game definitely has meat, most of it decayed, diseased, or regenerating fast...eek! ;)"
4,Overall good plot info...,"Any game requiring cheats is flawed! There are some essential plot developements provided. If you enjoy reading the novels, especially the North of Faerun, this game is good. I like the pronunciation of elven words but found the Elven civiliztion out of context in the frozen North. Make sure you create strong characters as well as enable your cheats, or the game is impossible!!!The design is great. Music, special effects, and the voice over hooks you from the beginning. The role playing is minimal, unlike Baldurs Gate. Hack and slash for those who like that style of play. The final scene is unbeateable, thus if you want to continue with the expantion, you must finish the original. Neverwinter Nights is much better in my opinion."
3,Almost There!,"I really like the Icewind Dale Series. If you are into D & D it is a must play. The one limitation with this game is the sequences are pre-planned. You as an adventurer must form a complete party, and you go place to place in the order in which the game proceeds, linear. Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2 are both similar games but much more complexity and freedom than this one."
1,Who Wrote These Reviews? Icewind Dale Employees?,"I can't believe I bought Icewind Dale based on the reviews I read here at Amazon! What an idiot I was! The people that said it is a great game must be easily amused. I found it very very disappointing. The game is a complete farse. The price is absurdly outrageous considering what you get. For those who have yet to make a purchase, do yourself a favor and buy something else."
5,Baldur's Gate in the arctic,"Icewind Dale uses the same engine from Baldurs Gate(not really a bad thing:) yet it seems to have a feel all its own. though a bit too linear in comparison to Baldurs Gate, its still great fun and excitement. i also like it because you dont get killed every five seconds like in Baldurs Gate. My only real complaint about this game is that there is a limit to the number of experience points you can get, and most classes can only go as high as around 15th, 16th, or 17th level. Other than that, it is an awesome game and a must-have for fans of fantasy rpgs."
4,Beautiful story. Definantly RPG game,"Although IWD doesn't have the state of the art graphics and stuff, this is a great RPG game for people who prefer to do more that just hack and slash. The storyline, though kinda short, it still good. In many cases, the game awards you for NOT killing, but trying to talk your way out of situations, capturing the true essence of RPG.Even though I don't think IWD can compare to Baldur's Gate in terms of size, number of quests and all, it is still a good game in itself."
4,The end??,"How friggin hard is the last battle? I just gave up on that scene - I'd love to know how anyone else did it. Apart from that, interesting (and addictive) game. You soon get bored with all the text, tho..."
4,For Dungeons & Dragons enthusiasts,"Icewind Dale was released in 2000. Excellent computer game with great graphics and music. It's somewhat difficult to play at times and requires a lot of patience. This game is based on the rules of the second edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D;). This game is similar to Diablo. This particular version of the game can be played on Windows 95, 98, and ME systems. Later versions support Windows XP and beyond.Without going into much detail, I'll just sum it up. This game will satisfy the Dungeons & Dragons enthusiast who enjoys computer incarnations and variations of the classic game. Everything from creating characters to using weapons and magic, this game has it all.If you want a good computer roleplaying game that's in the mold of Dungeons & Dragons, this is it. Highly recommended."
4,Icewind Dale,"Having been a fan since the first D&D games hit the market, I can honestly say that they have outdone themselves. Graphics are the best I've seen, as a hack and slash game with the Baldurs gate drive...Make More!"
1,Icewind Dale review,"Icewind Dale is a hack and slash game, disappointing role-players expecting a story line like Baulder's Gate's. The plot goes as such; there is a big scary evil somewhere and you just have to pick up the biggest weapon and go at it. Stunning visuals but with no plot, like a hollow birthday cake. I think that for ... more bucks, you'd be better off getting Baulder's Gate II."
2,"Sorta o.k., but not worth the money",".... It's ... frustrating, too the point that it isn't fun. I'm an avid gamer. It's fun to ""role-play"" low level characters. An orc or two can be a very scary thing. This doesn't translate well to a computer game that wipes out an entire party in ten seconds even with the ""AI"" scripts on. The visuals are cool, but I wish I would have plunked my money down for something else. This game does not deliver. Boring linear plot and hack-n-die. Buy some dice, a figure and paper for a real roleplaying game."
5,Exelente apoyo para el Predicador,"Este libro nos da un apoyo anecdotico muy practico para todos los que somos predicadores, las anecdotas vienen clasificadas por temas, lo que lo hace una obra de consulta y referencia muy práctica y nos ayuda a darle ese sabor anecdotico que despierta el interes en el oyente.Lo recomiendo ampliamente para todos los predicadores.Atte. Pastor Rodrigo MartinezMérida, Yucatán, México."
3,"Pretty good, there are better","The book as a stand alone learning tool is just OK. I'm sure the hands on sailing course is great, but I found the US Sailing and even the ASA books to be better resources. This book is more conversational in tone and not as thorough as I would like. It does a good job of including inspiring sidenotes to sailors."
2,Too complicated to build sailing skills,"This book does not achieve what it promises: to transition novice sailors to cruise-ready in seven days. The book is so crammed with sailing jargon and theory, that the reader cannot follow along well enough to gain confidence about advancing sailing expertise. By chapter three, it leaves readers feeling inept and hopeless. The authors use the book as a vehicle for sharing random, unnecessary tidbits such as how to cure hiccups! Stick to U.S. Sailing's certification books such as Basic Keelboat, Basic Cruising, and Bareboat Cruising instead."
3,Helicoil 5334-14 Save-A-Thread Thread Repair Kit M14 x 1.25,"I ordered this for my '99 F250 Super Duty. I ended up returning it. The reason, my mechanic showed me what he was going to use and immediately I saw these were flimsly in comparison to his thread repair kit. I'm sure it will have its use on other smaller engines, but I didn't want to take the chance."
5,helicoil sparkplug thread repair kit,"This product is a standard for this repair problem, and the kit is available from a number of providers. I found the price/shipping combination to be lowest for Amazon. And the item arrived as quickly as I could have hoped."
5,As promised,"This product performed just as promised. It was well worth the investment and is re-usable. It saved me a lot of money in repairs to, or replacement of, an old lawn mower that was in excellent condition except for a stripped spark plug hole. I highly recommend this product."
3,Not as good as original method,"I've used helicoil before where you drill, screw in and break off the tab and it worked great. This is different because you are inserting a coil into a wall instead of a hole if you know what I mean. The tapping device worked great and I question to this day if I should have stopped short and left some aluminum between plug hole and open cylinder because you screw in the coil with RTV and let it set before putting in a plug. Don't like ""gluing"" it in and don't like the feel of the spark plug when installing it. I wouldn't get too aggressive when installing that spark plug."
3,Works somewhat like stated.,"I used this kit on a stripped plug hole in an old Toyota 22RE.I used the spark-plug to thread the insert in like the instructions stated.I was then unable to remove the plug without the insert coming back out with it, therefore I was never able to use the punch tool to expand the cleats.Right now my engine is doing fine, however in about 30,000 miles when my plug is worn out I am not sure what will happen when I go to change the plugs again.I don't drive the truck all that much so I figure I am now in for a head replacement in about 5 years."
1,Neither History nor Cultural History,"The Sivulkas' work is a rather long narrative of American advertising -- with very little to offer beyond reproductions of some rather commonplace ads from the last two hundred years. Much of the information they offer seems to come from other sources, and there is no real bibliography to the book. It is most misleadingly titled ""cultural history"" since there is so very little to the book beyond a chronology, and that is full of mistakes, over-simplifications, and such bland statements that there is nothing to be learned from this book. Others have written much better and more meaningful things about the history of advertising, and charged less than [$$] for it."
3,Average Reference Book,"While this book has quite a bit of useful history, it is not meant to be read cover to cover. It works in a very straightforward format providing a mostly chronological laundry list of advertisers and advertising agencies. The book lacks an in-depth analysis of the relationship between advertising and American culture as its subtitle seems to suggest. The sections on minority and web-based advertising are woefully out of date and simplistic. However, the book has some great ad illustrations and there are several supplementary list which are quite interesting. Basically, it's a decent reference book, but not for anyone looking for an interesting take on the history of American advertising."
1,Doesn't dry,"I bought a can of this stuff last fall to use on my truck. Finally got around to it this spring. As a couple of others have mentioned here, it didn't dry. The can doesn't provide any drying times, only that you are to wait 15-20 minutes between coats. Two hours later, this stuff is still wet."
4,does what it needs to do,"ordered a case of this product. it covers fine, lasts long, does what it needs to do. it does not go on as heavy is the tite-seal brand undercoating i had before, but it costs much less. good deal for the money."
3,Worked as expected,"I had a leaky roof in a very hard to get to spot, and this worked like a charm to seal it up. The only reason this didn't get more stars is because it is VERY runny. I was finding it very difficult to work it into position on even a slight pitch, barely a 1 on 12 pitch. I ended up having to use far more then what i should have in order to get it done, spraying and trying to force it into position, waiting a few minutes until it started to dry and using that piece like a dam for the next spray.Overall it did its job, just took a bit more work than I expected to get it into the position I needed. Blackjack could not have gotten into that spot very well if at all, so this was just what I needed."
1,Dog would not drink the water,"After reading all of the reviews, I decided to give this product a try, hoping my dog would be like some of the others who had no problem drinking their water with this product added. No luck. My dog turned his nose up at it, and I even made it less strong than the bottle recommended. As soon as I put fresh water down, with no product in it, my dog drank and drank and drank. So, I am back to square one of looking for a product to reduce tartar and plaque on my dog's teeth."
1,Tasteless and Odorless? Hrrumph!!!,"I cannot rate this product since my cat simply refused to drink the water mixture. I followed the directions of water to solution, and even tried diluting it even more so. This product is advertised to be tasteless and odorless, but there is SOMETHING about this additive my kitty turns her nose up at! I purchased the 8 oz size, and sure am glad I didn't buy the gallon size!"
5,This stuff works!,"I used a similar product for my last dog - after he lost a few teeth. This time I started my puppy on Pet Kiss because Amazon reviewers spoke well of it. My dog is now almost three and his pearly whites are still pearly white. He just had a well dog visit and I asked the vet if it was okay to use the product (because it's almost too good to be true). He said it's okay and that my dog, now three, won't need to have his teeth cleaned for at least another two-three years. He is just now starting to get a little placque. That's with infrequent brushing. I think Pet Kiss and twice-a-week brushing could mean he won't need cleaning for another FIVE years or more."
1,"Very disapointed, I guess it doesn't work for everydog","I was excited to try this product to add to my 2 year old dog's dental regimen. I already brush her teeth 2-4 times/week, and she had all white teeth except her rear molars which would get yellow mushy plaque- the type i could scrape off with my fingernail in a chip.Well, after using this product, it seemed to have an opposite effect of what is claimed. I kept using it for weeks, thinking ""maybe it gets worse before getting better,"" but am now quitting after over a month of use before I do any more damage. The soft tartar has hardened and is now much tougher to break off, and more of her teeth have become discolored. She also now had a dark line at the gumline at her back molars that wasn't there before! I think now I need to take her in for a professional cleaning, something that I was hoping to avoid with attentive home care."
5,Pet Kiss Tartar Control,"Love this stuff. My 5 year old dog still doesn't need to have a dental and I am sure it is because of Pet Kiss. The vet said ""I don't know what you are doing but it is working, his teeth look great!"""
1,Product has no effect on dog's teeth,"After this product was highly recommended to me, I purchased an entire gallon since it was my intention to use this product on an ongoing basis. However, after using it for a few weeks, I have not seen any improvement in controlling the plaque and tartar build-up on my dog's newly cleaned teeth. I felt this would be a good follow-up to the dental cleaning he just had. Furthermore, the dog does not seem to like the product and has not been drinking nearly as much as he used to. The product is supposed to be tasteless but it is evident that my dog dislikes it. His breath is now almost as bad as it was before he had his teeth cleaned. I would not recommend this product as it does not seem to live up to the statements it boasts."
1,Dogs don't like it,I usually buy Dental Fresh for Dogs & Cats.. thought I'd save a few bucks and tried this. My dogs have their own water bowls.. I will add the additive to one of the bowls.. they will only drink out of the bowl without the additive.It says tasteless.. I can smell it.. obviously they can smell/taste it too.. and don't like it.
2,ok product,I was a bit dissappointed in this product. My dogs death breath did not respond like I had hoped. His breath could still gag a maggot off a rotten carcus. Although one of my other dogs didn't have as bad of gas as she use to. It is probably a decent product if your dog's teeth arent completely rotten already.
2,The Alchemist's Cat,"I got this book because I liked the Deptford Mice books. But this one was incredibly boring, like reading a textbook for history class. With the exception of the very beginning, the very end, and one or two places in the middle, this book was a snoozefest. Take my advice and get the other Deptford Mice stories: (The Dark Portal, Crystal Prison, Final Reckoning) and ignore this one, because you can do without it."
2,Boring,"Unlike the Deptford mice stories, this book is incredibly boring. I couldn't make it through the dull middle, and the only parts I found remotely interesting was the beginning and the end. The author spends way too much time on the creepy setting and the characters aren't sketched out very well. The whole thing isn't very well explained, its as if it needs a prequal to tell you how Dr. Spittle and the others actually ended up where tehy were at the beginning. You don't have to read this one to read the Deptford mice books, so I'd suggest reading those instead, and skipping this one."
4,Interesting beginning,"The evil begins... William Godwin, a boy whose family has all just fallen to illness, is forced to serve under a wicked alchemist because of a crime he didn't commit. On one cold winter day, William came across a mother cat and her three kittens. Having pity, William took the family back to the apothecary shop. Little did he know about the cat's true destiny and path that it follows. And there, an evil tail of horror, alchemy, and murder begins.The Alchemist's Cat is the prequel to The Dark Portal, and is also the beginning to the Deptford Mice Trilogy. This book of horror keeps its suspense, a book that keeps you reading and wanting more. Robin Jarvis has done a terrific job with this prequel. Readers of alchemy and horror will love this book."
5,pulls you in,"On an outing to my local bookstore a while ago, I came across a couple of books in the 'bargain bin', upon which the cover art (I know, ""don't judge a book....."")enchanted me. I bought them, and immediately came here to find the rest (turned out to be one book each from 2 related trilogies). I found the remaining 4, all marked down as well, hardcover, and in new condition, on Amazon. This is the first book of the second trilogy, which gives background to the other. I am loving these books! It is a rather dark storyline, but the characters (cats, rats, squirrels, etc.) are vivid and the writing pulls you in. This series (as well as the Deptford Mice Trilogy) is perfect for summer, when you want to read something that will transport you."
3,Not complete and NOT first CD version,"This CD collection of tracks from the 1943 revival of the Rodgers & Hart musical is advertised as the first CD presentation of these tracks. This is incorrect. I have a CD issued in 1999 by Box Office Recordings called ""A Collector's Rodgers & Hart"" which contains all the ""Connecticut Yankee"" tracks plus 14 additional tracks of Rodgers & Hart covers (different from the covers on the Decca CD).Worse, I have an AEI LP recording of the revival which has three additional tracks from the show. Why weren't these selections included in this recording?On the other hand, even the 9 tracks from Connecticut Yankee are worth owning. As a previous reviewer said, just Vivienne Segal's ""To Keep My Love Alive"" is worth the price of admission!"
3,"Oldie, but Goodie","Well, I was not expecting to like this one. Its SO old, and very classic (Rodgers and Hart.) But one good thing about it being Rodgers and Hart, is it has lovely lyrics. Clever and witty on every song. Mark Twains book was done justice I think, but I've never read the book. I would suggest this to classic lovers, and newer Broadway fans who want to hear a`""classic"" other than Oklahoma. This is a good one. The other great thing about this CD is you get not only A Connecticut Yankee, but also highlights from two other Rodgers and Hart musicals: Higher and Higher and By Jupiter. AWSOME. Favorite Song: ""To Keep My Love Alive"""
1,Over prices by $50.00. Beware!,"This is a total piece of trash. It broke within three days of using it and was not what the price reflected it was. I thought I was getting the Mega model (since I've owned two other Littermaids before and been very happy), but I feel this vendor that Amazon.com is using is very deceptive about what they are selling and the price they're charging. The only answer I received from J-P Pet Supply was send it back and I've received no response from Amazon.com regarding the overcharge of $50.00 for this product."
4,worship from God's perspective,"I found this book to be a refreshing source on the topic of worship. Peterson traces the concept of worship for Israel from the OT to the NT, which helped me understand much of the remaining Jewish customs and backdrop for worship for believers today. I was especially encouraged by the discussion of the temple and the reality that worship is no longer bound by a geographical location. In fact now that we are indwelt by the Holy Spirit, our entire lives can and should be lived to worship God.While I did not agree with everything I read, this book is very ""engaging"" and has really stimulated my thinking on the subject."
5,Beautiful CD,The songs on the CD were very touching and emotional. I could identify with all the songs.
2,Terra Nostra,"I bought the CD (actually 2 of them, one for a friend), as a result of a National Public Radio Magazine article about Sevina (article complete with great music clps). BUT, when the CD arrived and I played it, I was greatly disappointed. This CD needs a National Geographic Label not a Popular Music Label. Savina offers outstanding ethnic and musical talent. Sevina's haunting mid-Eastern ""replicas"" of Enja and Fairuz are wonderful but there are only five or six tracks that could be used in a group appreciation (party) environment, these are eclipsed by a cacaphony of, probably ethnically accurate, but tooth and spine jarring interpretations of multi- ethnic sounds. Note the word sounds - not music. For 13 bucks it's a great listening experience but it's one of those CD's that you listen to once and then bury - unless you have a CD burner and can pick and copy the up the best five."
3,Good basic book,"Good for basic pronunciations, however some definitions are very elementary. I was expecting to see the more common dog and cat diseases listed, even if only how to say them! It is not clear in the preface how the stress is designated, and one of the 'examples' given is not listed in the book. All in all though a good little book"
4,"A.C, Moore and his gaag have done it again","The New Pornographers have grown leaps and bounds in the last year. They're steadily gaining national recognition while staying loyal to their sound and fanbase. Electric Version, was a gem of an album combining catchy music with excellent vocals. The harmonies stay in your head and keep you tapping your feet for days.Twin Cinemas, the bads most recent record, continues this trend. The record is not quite as upbeat as Electirc, but still screams fun. A.C. Moore and his band sound tight and together throughout the record. Leading off with the perky ""Twin Cinemas"" the record maintains a steady sound and quality."
3,"Not my favorite, but ...","I'll never make it through this album in one listen. I much more a fan of the earlier Mass Romantic release. Still, they're a great band with a lot of energy. Give it a shot if you're looking for something new."
3,Empty Calories,"The New Pornographers can not be faulted for their musical ability. It shines through all over this set. They have a great idea of power pop, and their performance here is energetic. By no means are they phoning it in. I think the problem here is the songs themselves. I just don't care about them. I don't hate them, but they don't stay with me, make me want to listen to them, or demand repeated listenings. Most others are going to disagree, and I understand that, but like the famous line, there is no ""there"" there."
2,An overrated album,"Let me start by saying that this album does have a few excellent tracks, like ""Bones of an idol"" as well as ""These are the Fables"" and ""The Bleeding Heart Show"" but that's about it. The rest of the tracks on the album are simply not memorable, easily forgotten. Personally, I don't think that three tracks on an album of 14 songs makes it a worthwhile addition to any music listener's collection. If you like the idea of what they're trying to do with their music check out ""Chutes Too Narrow"" by The Shins."
2,Help me to understand...,"...I mean, it's not like I just stumbled upon rock/pop music last year. But I don't understand the infatuation with the New Pornographers. Reviewers talk about them like they're pop music gods, but I just hear 10th rate Belle and Sebastians. Please ignore this album."
3,Sweet sounds...but I ain't buyin' the message,"Hey, how can you NOT enjoy the tuneful, poppy sounds on this 2005 CD? Each song on ""Twin Cinema"" is gorgeous. Problem is, I ain't buyin' what these guys and Neko Case are sellin', no siree, Bob. New Pornographers are exceptionally talented and have a great ear for melody, but the name they gave themselves is dirty and not fit for the mainstream values of this great country. ""Twin Cinema"" is easily the best CD of the year, and this band probably equals the Shins and bands of that ilk. But when you name yourself after an unclean industry, that's when you're beggin' for disaster. Take your smut and go somewhere else, guys (and Neko Case).Van Halen. Now there's a band you can count on for a virtuous outlook!!!! Where's Roth been these days?? E-mail me with the results!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Instant gratification,"This is my first New Pornographers album, and I have to say I'm a very satisfied customer! I love the musical and lyrical creativity of Twin Cinema. On top of digging their style, I love every song.My favorite tracks are the title track, ""The Bones of an Idol"", ""Jackie, Dressed in Cobras"", ""These Are the Fables"", and ""Stacked Crooked"". Other highlights include the chorus of ""Use It"", the bridge on ""Three or Four"", the guitar at the end of ""The Jessica Numbers"", the build-up midway through ""Streets of Fire"", and the climax of ""The Bleeding Heart Show""."
4,"I love this album, the band is great live too!",I found this to be a very thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable album. I love the songs Twin Cinema and The Bleeding Heart Show.
5,Made me a fan.,"This is a great album, it made me a fan. I bought it initially because I had seen it recommended by people on sites I frequently visit, none of them actually being music dedicated sites.I approached it with an open mind, I like stuff that is more ""out there"" than this album. My first though was that it was a little boring and I ""shelved"" it (I would skip songs when they would come up randomly and so on) for maybe a month or so. Then I gave ""Bleeding Heart Show"" a listen and it made me want more. I now own three of their albums."
4,Annie still shines,"While she may be a bit older, her voice is still remarkable. I would have liked a few more Renaissannce songs. The last song from Scherazade makes it worth every penny though."
5,Great,I would recommend this to all of my friends. Great story. I loved the people and the story line alot
3,Kept but will keep looking for a better one,"A bit of a disappointment. The bottom base holds water, quite a bit, something I like to avoid in items that I run through the dishwasher. The edge along the top rim catches things; like blueberries that I wash and want to pour back into their plastic container. I have to shake the colander to get the berries over the rim, which, of course results in a few of them missing the container.I am happy with the over all size, good for one person, and the size of the holes."
3,Seems a little flimsy,"The colander arrived with a large dent in it; Amazon gave me a replacement without any trouble. Overall, the colander seems flimsy, but does its job as well as any other."
4,Metal Colander,This colander is just right for me. The size is perfect and it washes up nicely. It's on the large size so you really do need to find cupboard space for it.
3,Better Elsewhere,"The IKEA $6.99 colander also has perforated stainless steel, is quite commodious, and has the ear handle on one side, but a long handle on the other which makes it possible to rest it across your sink. You can therefore drain without any of the liquids standing around in the bottom of the colander, and rinse everything very easily under your faucet. The holes are small enough to wash rice with no grains slipping through, cleans so easily, goes in the dishwasher. It has little feet on the bottom, rather than the rim bottom, so easily rests in a bowl too. It is my all time favorite colander, but I would rate this one a good second choice. I can't imagine doing without that long handle, though."
1,Absolutely hate it,"Given the price, I thought that this would be a decent product. I think it is absolutely horrible to clean if you don't clean it immediately after use. I find that a lot of things stick in it and are difficult to remove. I will be shopping for a different colander."
3,collander,From all apparances it will be a good product. Unfortunately it hasn't been put to use yet.
2,Not happy with this purchase.,"Bought all three sizes (sm/med/lg), and will be returning same.The way the colander, itself, is attached to the base allows for foodstuffs to get caught in there...forever! Not good."
2,"I love it, BUT","Ok I love the tiny holes so that I don't worry about shaking the spaghetti out of the colander. The problem are the handles. While this is meant to sit in the sink and you don't ""have"" to hold it, at times I do ""need"" to. The handles are very thing and you have to brace a finger or two against the side of the colander where the hot food is in order to hold it upright. You can't just grasp the handle and hold it straight. So, I am disappointed in that aspect and would not purchase it again for this reason. Also, I think the bottom of the inside could be a little more rounded. The liquid tends to pool around the rather wide are the colander is attached to the base. So when I tip it to release the liquid, I risk losing some pasta if I have made a big batch. Using this for pasta was my main reason for purchasing it."
5,"Ok, but check size","A good product, just be aware that it is not very big. That is what I wanted, but ..."
4,Tovolo Perforated Colander,"Drains well, doesn't tip; only negative would be that food particles sometimes stick on little ridge on bottom where stand of the colander attaches to the base of the perforated bowl portion; doesn't affect function, just a few more seconds to clean."
3,Just average,"It is smaller than I thought, and a little too pricey for the size since the quality is nothing to brag about. I am sure the base will separate from the bowl over time. Also, shipping was a mess!!! Amazon disappointed me this time around."
3,A decent colander,"It functions as your basic colander. Good for straining pasta and vegetables and such of course. Two slight drawbacks: one is that it can be tricky to clean. Bits of pasta tend to get stuck in the small holes; it's kind of like a grater. The other is that water sometimes builds up in the base and doesn't come out when you shake it vertically. But when you take it out of the sync and it goes at an angle the water will drip out onto the floor. Not huge, but it's something you have to be aware of."
3,"Tovolo Stainless Steel Perforated Colander, Medium",The Colander is of high and excellent sturdy material. The only reason I gave a rating of 3 is the size Medium is missleading. This size should be considered small.
4,Best Colander,"Someone in earlier review wrote that this 'tore up her sponge' when she washed it, but that has not been my experience at all. It drains great, as advertised. Very glad I got it."
3,has some flaws,"This colander is hard to clean, due to the metal ridge around the outer circumference. Things get stuck under the ridge and don't just rinse right out. Also, of you are draining liquid in the sink, the colander blocks the drain and you'll find the liquid backing up into the colander."
3,Too Small for Medium,"This purportedly medium-sized colander is only very slightly larger than the small size. In fact, I initially thought they had sent me the wrong size."
2,Large collander turns out to be small,"I like the design of this collander (it has a fairly large, round base that is less likely to tip over), and it seems to be reasonably well made. However, what is sold as the ""large"" size is actually quite small. The inside diameter of the bowl is just over 9"" and, even more problematic, the bowl is well less than 4"" deep (i.e., quite shallow.) Thus, the capacity of the collander is actually very limited and it can be characterized as large only relative to the other two that Amazon sells, which must be quite tiny. Be forewarned."
4,Practical for small to medium jobs.,Just what I needed. Easy to store because of its size. Always preferred stainless and this strainer does the job.
3,"Ok, but not the same as America's Test Kitchen top rated","I bought this because I thought this would be the equal to the RSVP colander. In comparison, the Tovolo is OK, but is much smaller than the large RSVP and is less smooth around the perforations. Overall, it seems not as high quality. This should be considered medium sized. For the price, it is an OK deal.As an aside, my first Tovolo arrived dented/damaged. Amazon replaced it very quickly, but packing could be better when this is shipped."
3,Great concept,"I have purchased the Ergo Pet Watering System for my cats. I have found that the filter is useless, the pump is undersized, and the whole thing must be disassembled daily for a through cleaning. Other then all that the product works for what it was designed for."
4,works great,"We have had this for our gang(3 dogs, 1 cat) for 4 years now. Only have to change/clean/refill water once a week , it stays clean !the only issue is finding replacement filters..buy them in bulk when you find them..."
2,Do not buy this fountain! Waste of money!,"I purchased the large Ergo Auto Pet Waterer a few weeks ago. It was great in the beginning, although my dogs did not drink from it very much. Then I went to clean it. It is a bear to clean. And lifting the 5 gallon water bottle in order to clean it, isn't pleasant either. When I cleaned it, there was a small piece next to the plastic filter that broke off. Plus, it leaks water in between the water tank and the bowl. I should call the manufacturer to ask for a new plastic piece, but it's not listed in the manual. My next fountain will not have an outlet. And as far as keeping it free from dog hair or food, that's bogus too. It does not keep the water free from hair or food. Do yourself a favor, and don't waste your money on this product!"
1,NOT recommended,Pump failed after 1 week. Unable to register warranty on web site. Still waiting to hear from customer service. Skip it...
2,autopetoasis fountain,"I purchase the small size, holds about 3 gallons of water. I dont find that the waterer bowl stays any cleaner than the petmate. The only advantage is not having to fill it up as often. The company states how quite this is, (well its not) even when working at full capacity. The filters cost about $13.00 for two then you have to add in the shipping to. I emailed company who makes this product with a question and they never answered me back. Save your money, its not worth paying $80.00 + dollars for."
4,Good filtered water automatic pet waterer,"The product works well for both cats and small dogs. It is a bit noisy and takes a short while for your pets to get used to the pump motor noise and the bubbling of the water tank noise. Does a good job of providing a constant flow of fresh filtered water. The only drawback is cleaning the bowl area. The whole unit must be unplugged and turned upside down after removing the water jug to rid the bowl of inevitable dirt and hair that finds its way into the drinking area as it sits on the floor. Overall, it's a good product, especially for cats with renal problems."
3,Pet Waterer,The drinkinbg bowl does not hold enough water and the filter gets clogged alot requiring complete disassembly to clear.
4,"Not a hacks book, interesting though","This isn't really a hacks book per se. It's a set of 100 small vignettes on the brain and on neuroscience. I found surprisingly little on how to change the behavior of your brain. Or practical ways to focus your attention, to become smarter or faster. That's what I was hoping to see. Though what I see instead is interesting all on it's own.If you are interested in neuroscience, or the function of the brain. And little games of tweaking your perception that you probably learned in Psych 101 and hen forgot. You will probably like this book.Though I should also mention On Intelligence (0805074562) from Times Books. That book explains the nature and function of intelligence as a coherent story, and doesn't suffer from being shoeboxed into a Hacks series form like this book does."
4,A fun book,"It is not a typical ""hacks"" book in that it does not tell you how to utilize you brain more effectively or do neat things. It *does* have a lot of exercises that show you cool things on how your brain works with sections describing how your brain works - and a number of experiments (blind spot, Magnet interaction with the brain, word parsing in the the mind, and so on). This book goes very well with a recent title called _Mind Wide Open_ by Steven Johnson.If you want traditional ""hacks"" the book ""Mind Performance Hacks"" just came out, and is chock full of those sorts of experiments, while less informative, does do things like memory tricks, meath calculation, creativity enhancement and so on.I view ""Mind Hacks"" as more informative, though, so would recommend this as the first one to get, though the next purchase in this should be the ""Mind Performance Hacks."""
1,"Not really a ""hacks"" book","I was sorely disappointed in this book--I checked it out from the local library and hoped that it would actually live up to the subtitle of including tips and tools for using my brain. It didn't; the few ""tips"" included were those that are found in virtually every other discussion of how to improve memory.This book is more geared toward folks who are designing user interfaces--it talks about how the brain processes information (and thus describes ways to improve information conveyance)."
3,interesting but too extensive,the reason i gave this book a 3 star rather than a 4 is that it appears to be what it is not: a how-to book on molding the mind. i am however enjoying using it as a browser and reference book and have to say that it is quite well organized with sections covering main senses or applications of the mind. and as usual with o'reilly books - the format is exemplary.
5,Excellent!,Condition was exactly as stated. Arrived promptly. (Never have received a book so quickly!) If only all of life would turn out so well...
4,Mind Hacks: Tips & Tools for Using Your Brain,It's a book very interested about language in mind and speech comprehension. I read a short comment in BBC Focus magazine and I wish to read because it's very easy to learn the misteries of mind in cognitive science applied to language and psichology.
3,Interesting but disappointed,"Learning about the mind is okay, but I didn't learn anything that I hadn't seen in Psych 101, and a few interesting articles later on.Calling it a ""hacks"" book is false advertising, at best. Should it make it to another printing, I would hope O'Reilly would rename it.The information seemed accurate, so I'll give it that."
3,Interesting but not very practical bits about how your mind works.,Points about how the brain works that aren't that practical to really use. The authors know the subject very well. I was looking for more practical applications.
4,How to Hack Your Mind & Others,"Although there is not very much ""new"" information here, its great to have it all compiled in one book. Each hack is one to five pages in length and includes lists of extra resources to explore further. As a result, the book goes beyond the pages and is an interactive reading experience.There is a lot of information here that you probably won't care about and will never read, but it serves as a great reference to explore areas of interest.I particularly liked the chapters on facial recognition, detecting cheaters, and boosting memory power. I could have done without the chapters explaining optical illusions, aural illusions, and how to have an out of body experience.In short, this is a very interesting read. You will definitely find something here that will interest you and likely improve how you use your brain. Recommended."
4,Mold reducer,Good for use in areas with poor air flow to prevent mold when mixed with 35%H202 at correct ratioand with proper application.
5,Many different uses.,This was recommended to me by my Doctor for female issues. It seems that there are so many different benefits to Boric Acid. I couldn't live with out this product. It seems that many old time products work better then new ones. It was surprising to me that it kills cockroaches. I have used it for years.
5,kills yeast and bacteria,"I use Boric acid for my vaginal yeast infections. This is the only thing that works and it works fast! I get release after the first capsule. I fill a capsule size 00 with boric acid powder and insert it before bed. In the morning,I am completely symptom free. I use it every time I feel that a yeast inf. is coming on. I don't play around any more and I am grateful there is something I can count on. This is my life-saver."
3,Not sure this is the Boric Acid I ordered...,"I ordered this Boric Acid, but when the package arrived, the label looks very different from the picture on here. I ordered it to use for yeast infections. Can anyone tell me if the Boric Acid bottle says for Household and Farm Products if that can still be used for that? I heard there was a difference between the insecticide and the Boric Acid that you could use for YI. Are they all the same? I don't want to use something I am not suppose to. And the company should send the one that looks just like the picture. I picked this one because of all of the testimonials on this one for YI's."
1,This stuff was horriable,"I have used Vitanica suppositories and it worked much better. However there are so many bad reviews for the suppositories that I thought I would try to make my own suppositories with Boric Acid.I was only able to make it 5 days and my vagina was way worse off than it had been with the BV infection, it irritated me so bad that it caused me to bleed. I was so uncomfortable for the 5 days I used it. It was not messy at all like the Vitanica Suppositories are.My Dr told me to use the suppositories for 2 wks. There would have been no way.I would not recommend this product to my friend. But I would recommend the Vitanica (sp?) which I am now going to buy today to see if I can clear up my bv."
5,"Greatest Stuff for Roaches, Ants, Spider, Silverfish Etc.","Many years ago, I bought boric acid powder at the pharmacy for a huge roach problem in a very large 8-room NYC WWI apartment that had been infested for years. On a Friday night, I sprinkled the powder around the perimeter of every single room and left for the weekend. On Monday morning I came back and every single floor of the apartment was covered with 3"" of dead and dying roaches--an unbelievable scene right out of a horror film. I got a broom, swept them up (not an easy or quick task) and did not have more than a one or two cockroach (or ant or spider) sighting for the 4 years I worked in the apartment.This product is a bit messy, but it works quickly and then you can sweep/vacuum it up and do a quick wet Swiffer if necessary. Totally worth the effort to avoid the toxicity of insecticides."
5,does the job for bv,"my doc gave me an rx for antibiotics for bv. yeah right, i ain't using that crap any more, as it creates a hoard and slew of more yeast and bv issues. in addition to other preventative measure (diet and basic home remedies), i put a capsule of this up my vagaga, and wa-la, all better. take some expensive probiotics tho if this is your intended use of the product as you need to replace the good stuff that left along with the bad."
3,Ear Cleaner for dogs,"Blue Power Ear WashI use Boric Acid, two tablespoons of it in 250mls Surgical Spirit, with 8 drops of Gentian Violet all well shaken together, to rid dogs of ear mites. Need to use it twice a day for a couple of days, then once a day for about a week. After that, a monthly clean should keep the dogs ears sweet and clean and mite free. [...]Cherrill Deans"
5,WONDERFUL,I love using natural remedies for my health problems and this worked wonderfully! I just filled up 00 gel capsules and used one each night before bed and presto my yeast infection was cured!
2,Silk Shell,The shell I purchased was really small. You might want to get a larger size as I don't think the sizing chart was accurate for what I received.
5,Really lovely silk,This silk blouse is lovely and very reasonable. The sizes run small so its best to get a larger size. I am very satisfied with it and I intend to buy more.
3,Really sheer and not appropriate for work,"I bought this top in hopes of wearing it to work, but it is made with much thinner weight fabric than appears in the photo. It is completely see-through and must be worn with something like a camisole underneath, making it completely inappropriate for work. It seems really fragile, as well. The fabric is so thin and fine. I haven't worn it yet so I don't know how long it will last, but it's pretty useless in my wardrobe."
5,Excellent,"This was one of my first cd's.I'm only 18, and missed that generation by a few years, but i stumbled across this CD, and it launched me into the world of Punk music.its so good. its catchy.its nigh perfect."
4,Classic Punk-Oi!,"Classic Punk-Oi! from back in the day. Lyrics are down to earth and music classic early punk. Sort of think of early Clash, Ruts and you get the idea.Best thing about this is you get 2 albums on the one CD. You may want to check out bands like The Business if you like this one."
5,Perfect no-nonsense small backpack,"My wife and I have been using our Bullet pack for probably 10 years now, almost every week. It is one of our favorite pieces of gear.We use it multi-pitch climbing, as a secondary backpack when hiking, as a carrier for jackets and snacks when walking in town, as a ski pack, and to contain our essentials in the car on a road trip. It is narrow and well shaped so it does not get in the way of arm movements.This is a no non-sense pack, and I love it for that: no zillions of side pockets, ipod stach, pen holder, cheap compass, etc.; just the essentials."
4,Rob Parton's Eleventh Hour Live CD,Rob Parton has a cookin' band with some great charts. The solo work is outstanding!
3,OK but...,"A lot of songs not very interesting. The reason I purchased the record is the excellent You + me = love and the ultra-rare long version of Lipstick. The version of Wear it out featured here is not the 6:20 12"" version. The informations about the songs are not very complete."
4,Put on your platform shoes ms honey,"The Disco Connection takes you back to a time whenall you waited for was Friday night....time to put onyour best outfit from head to toe and boogie down tothe DJ at your favorite hot-spot. This collection seemsto venture in and out of that disco era especially withunderground hits such as ""Ill tell you"" Sergio Mendes and ""Wear it Out"" Starguard.. these were not commercialhits. You only heard them if you went out to the club, that is what I like about dance collections. Give memusic I can no longer find and that were big hits fromthose days...Kudos to the producers keep it up..."
5,Very good,"The book was delivered in a timely manner. The book was in great condition eventhough it was a used one, and the price was simply perfect."
1,Where did he go?,"I would have really loved to play this game. If it followed the same pattern as the other Atlantis games (which were fun for me) I would have given it a rave review. But for me, to be able to see the main character while playing the game is a must. Shadows do not cut it. For some reason the character disappears after starting the game. I tried changing settings as suggested by the games tech help but to no avail. I would not recommend buying this game until the flaws are fixed or a patch is provided. For me it was a waste of money since I cannot play the game."
2,Not very well put together.,"This game is a dissapointment. It's very frustrating when you have to position your character on an exact pixel to accomplish something. Often times it takes 20 or 30 tries to figure out where the magic spot is. I see so real reason why this game works like that, other than it was not put together correctly. Overall this game is very sophmoric."
1,Waste of money!,"Good moisturizer, nothing more. Not worth more than $10-15. I have been using this lotion for about two months now. My skin tone and texture haven't improved whatsoever. I wasn't expecting a miracle moisturizer, but for the price I was expecting to see at least some improvement."
5,Amazing - and FREE!,"Freespace 2 is an amazing game - but take note: it was released into the public domain on April 25, 2002, when Volition released the source code to the public as a noncommercial license. The engine is now the basis for the (also free) Battlestar Galactica based game ""Beyond the Red Line.""If you are a collector, you're gonna pay a stiff price for that box. If you are a player, the game is available for gratis."
3,I just don't get it.,"True, the graphics are incredible, and the story behind the game is quite interesting, but...the game itself is dull. Basically you fly around in a beautifully generated computer environment shooting at other ships. If the graphics and musical score were a tenth of what they are, the average user would see it as the low-brow arcade sim that it is. PS: I STILL have not found a game that even closely rivals Red Baron 3D. Now that's a game!"
3,Five for Hell--have a look-see!,"What can I say?Five for Hell is an action flick starring five or six army guys who are trained, then sent to obtain ""Plan K"" from the Nazi army. (For more information, please visit the Internet Movie Database.)Fun things to look for?1. A softball or two.2. Fancy stunts--involving a trampoline and near the end, a knife.Other then that, expect sporadic slow scenes--accompanied by thrilling action sequences.WARNING: Should at least be 18 because of INTENSE ACTION SEQUENCES!Visual affects? Graphics? (Lol)...When I saw the show on TV, when the camera shot from a distant angle, the people looked long and skinny. However, I think that they might have fixed that--considering that it's on DVD.So...check it out."
