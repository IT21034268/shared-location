4,"5 stars for the movie, lost one for lack of extras!","I love this movie! One of the best foreign films of all time. This is one of those movies that transcends language barriers and even those who don't like to read subtitles will find this such a mesmerizing production they would even notice or mind. This movie HAS to be heard in French. I only wish I could, in good conscience, give it 5 stars. I have to take one away for the appalling lack of bonus material. This film deserves the full treatment - 2 discs, even. It's a shame that MGM didn't spend more time or money on this treasure of a film."
3,a masterpiece deserving better picture quality,"This film is one of my favorites.However, this DVD is not anamorphic. The picture quality is only marginally better than LD. This takes away much of my viewing pleasure.I suggest that Amazon should change the format from widescreen to letterbox. I also suggest a new edition of this great film with better picture and sound quality."
5,How often does one find perfection?,This is one of those rare treats . . . a flawless jewel of a film which thrills me each and every time I watch it. Perfection all around from direction to editing to acting to costuming.
4,"Rostand is brilliant, Depardieu is lacklustre...","My passion for the play of Cyrano de Bergerac runs very deep, and it is exciting to see and hear it in film, but the acting of Depardieu leaves something to be desired. Beyond the fact that he has a beer belly, rather unfitting of the hero of modest means which he portrays, his acting is lackluster, bolstered only by the quality of the underlying play and his ability to verbally express the French language. If you don't speak French, consider the much less expensive and more expressive version by Jose Ferrer. If only Jose Ferrer could speak French!"
3,a mediocer repoduction of a master piece,in my opinion i thought it was a horrible reproduction of the timeless master piece heck even the 1950 wersion was more real
2,Who the heck wrote the subtitles?,"Perhaps if I understood French, I might appreciate this performance. Unfortunately, I had to rely on the English subtitles. The translation was so grotesque--yes, a word from Cyrano via Brian Hooker--that I could not watch more than 15 minutes. With such a marvelous, witty, timeless English translation as Hooker's, why write a new one? ""Cyrano"" is all about words, but instead of soaring poetry, we get something less than even Christian could write. Mealy-mouthed, unpoetic, lumbering, inelegant, a pug, a nob, a button-nose! ""And so, as I end the refrain, Thrust home!"""
2,"Great play, miscast Cyrano and a dull, flat English translation","""Cyrano"" is one of the greatest verse plays ever written.Unfortunately Gerard Depardieu is no Cyrano. He's a great, clumsy side of beef, not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of Hercule Sevanien Cyrano de Bergerac. With the best will in the world, his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance.The English translation was especially commissioned for this film. It is undistinguished, prosy and dull. It has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the 1920s by the great American actor Walter Passmore.Get the Jose Ferrer version. This one's a dog."
3,"Healthier than Eats,Shoots and Leaves","Picked up Trask's Penguin Guide to Punctuation in Oxford UK this July, read it on the flight home and am already using it for executive English improvement classes.It's neat because it's not pretentious and strips away most of the historically rigid and stern grammar and punctuation 'rules'of the last 50 years. The author wants to make punctuation a 'living' art, and clear communication and sense of meaning are more important than abiding by old disciplines. He uses plently of sample phrases and sentences to illustrate 'correct'usage and highlights definite 'no nos'.Differences between American and British punctuation are covered, but rather superficially. In its 180 pages there is enough to keep you on the right track."
2,Not Up to his other Work,"I read Mr. Thayer's White Star about a ex-sniper prosecuting attorney in a duel mental and physical duel with the deranged son of one of his victims.Unfortunate, IMO (in my opinion), this novel is not as good. The plot and motivations seem forced and contrived."
4,Awesome for high school cheerleaders! :),"This is a step by step video on how to successfully perform and execute the basic and elite parts of cheerleading. The video goes over many different aspects of cheerleading and has something for every one. Stunts, tumbling, dancing, cheers, sidelines, and much much more. It isn't extremely long, but long enough to give you the basic ideas. A favorite part of mine was how to execute basket tosses correctly. I would recommend this video to any one interested in becoming a cheerleader or improving their technique."
4,Cheerleading,"Professional and well-produced video. It was well rounded, including all basic components to cheerleading, but lacked creative ideas and moves for one's own squad."
1,torn,"I am torn because I really like the way these boots look. However, my foot could not fit under the shifter. These may be true to their name, Field Armor, not sport bike racing..... I wear a size 9 and took a chance on a 9.5. That was a mistake, I should have gotten a 10 because they apparently run small. Wasted my money on these, but they sure look impressive."
3,Disappointed.,My first one lasted 10 yrs and was my favorite utensil. Next one lasted 2 weeks. Replaced that. Replacement lasted 2 mos. The idea is fantastic! Still a favorite. Workmanship is very poor. Fell apart...again. Disappointed. Ordered from Amazon...sent from another Co.
5,Best ever!,"These are the BEST tongs/spatula ever! I have used the plastic ones many times before but they broke and couldnt find any replacements in stores. Looked on amazon and found these. Even better. They are perfect for so many things and store flat, which is nice."
4,Nifty gimmick,"These work a little more convenient than the rounded end utensils, but they don't replace them exactly. The flat ends don't do well mixing in a bowl, but they work wonderfully for flipping solid foods on a tray or in oil, and they seem to be a little more solidly made than the rounded ones. The lock can get in your way, usually when it's time sensitive or you don't have your other hand free. Great product, though."
1,Shabby Kindle Edition,"My bad rating is not related to the book content, but to the Kindle edition of the original material. For a price point above $50, I expect a carefully edited book. Instead, I have to suffer through numerous typographical errors and badly scanned code snippets and formulae. For a technical text, where details matter, this is unforgivable. I strongly advise to buy the paper edition until a proper digital conversion of the material has been done."
4,Comments for Fortran Users,"As the book description indicates, the text is based on the C language. The Fortran MPI function calls are slightly different (syntatically) than the C equivalents. Fortran users should be aware that these differences are not discussed in the text. However, the sample programs from the text are available in Fortran from the author's web page (referenced in the book).Aside from this, Parallel Programming With MPI is an easy reading book which introduces the material through working examples. The book also contains a nice introduction to high performance computing and optimization issues. I still have a lot to learn , but I'm glad I bought it!"
5,Very thorough,Very seldom do I find a programming book being as detail as this one. Definitely worth reading if you are new to MPI.
5,Great Hose,"I really like these hoses. I have two, one is 50 feet and one is 100 feet. The hoses are sturdy, don't kink and the reinforcements near the attachments are brilliant. That is one of the areas where my old hose failed. It got crushed where it was wound up and so was permanently kinked. This hose hasn't kinked yet and it doesn't have the weird chemical smell when I run the water. When I need to replace my other hoses, this is the one I will buy."
2,Leaks,"The hose seems high quality, but the hardware at the spigot end leaks. After fooling around with it a bit I found they put an O-ring in that end that just does not work. I replaced the O-ring with a regular hose sealing ring and then it still leaked a bit. Adding teflon tape to the threads took care of that. If I were not using Nelson brass quick connectors this hose would be a total loss. Since the quick connector stays on the end of the hose the teflon tape works."
2,Not worth the money,"Bought this hose because the reviews were decent on its quality and lack of kinking. My problem with the hose is twofold. One, while it is easy to attach to the faucet, it leaks significantly, which is simply not acceptable for a hose of this apparent quality and price point. Second, while the hose is not kink-free, it is kink-resistant, and it should be, because the hose is so unwieldy.Overall, it's not a bad hose, but it is not worth the price. Quality is comparable to an Apex in being kink-free, and the Apex is more affordable."
4,Nice,"A bit expensive, never have kinked on me. That was the reason I bought this high dollar hose. It is a lot better then the high price cheap crap I have been buying from Lowes."
1,Very Disappointed,"Purchased this product in spring of 2010. The hose already has non-reducing kinks where the ply has broken down. Not the quality of product I expected from Gilmour. On a positive note, the connectors at either end seem well made and should be durable.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE."
4,What you would expect,"not rocket science, every hose should just be like this one. Perect, not too thick not too thin and doesnt kink. sort of refreshing really. Basically the same as the farm house but differnt color. I like this color better for hose reels."
2,hosey,We live in hot weather. It becomes too flexible and kinks. Needs more platinum. not too bad not too good.
1,Hose just split. It wasn't run over or misused.,"I was very happy with this hose and thought it would last a good long time. It is taken in in the winter and treat with care . I am sorry to say it is useless now. [...]I Sure wish I could get a new free prelacement one. I'm really disappointed,"
4,Good Quality Hose,I'm not a professional gardener but I do know decent quality when I see it.Hose is very flexible and is pretty much kink proof with average use and pulling.It will kink if you force it to kink. It does leak just a small bit at the bib but every single hose I've ever owned has leaked a little bit that's just life....Fairly reasonable weight not too hard for my 100 pound wife to manage on her own.Overall I'm pleased with my purchase! I may just get the 50ft hose also
4,Heavy duty,Great hose but difficult to wound up when finished using. I can deal with the difficulty of trying to wound up on hose holder. My other hoses would get holes in them. I've had this all of summer and had no problems with holes.
2,Leaks,The one I received leaks at the collar. Tried is at several different spigots and the same result. Guess I received a fluke. Sent back for a refund. I'm sure it's a great hose if it didn't leak.
3,Use with a Suncast PowerWind,This hose should not be recommended for use with a power wind because you can not connect the hose. I had to cut the hose and put on a new female to attached it.
3,"Nice Hose, But---","Bought this hose to go with a SunCast hide-a-way hose box. These two items are shown on the same pages, ""people who bought this also bought this"". The faucet end of the Gilmour hose is too large to fit through the guide hole on the SunCast hose box. The only way to get the two together is to string the nozzle end of the hose through the guide hole and pull,or push, all 100 feet of the hose through the hole. Otherwise, the Gilmour hose seems like a well made sturdy product."
3,Great Information - Poor Delivery,"Pony Boy provides very good information on how to train horses. In fact, the content and quality of the information mirror what Clinton Anderson teaches. The problem with this DVD is how the information is presented. Perhaps Pony Boy should have had a better Director.Pony Boy sits and lectures/explains the process of how he does his ground work with the horse. Then Pony Boy demonstrates what he lectured/explained but he does not use a microphone to make comments and explain his actions.Clinton Anderson explains his ground work as he stands with the horse and as he works with the horse. This method of demonstration is far more effective as it is much easier for the viewer to remember the ""Show and Tell"" examples.As previously cited, Pony Boy has the information but the Clinton Anderson DVD delivers it much better!"
5,Unlike any other Video out there.....,"his two set VHS tapes have been worn out at our barn lounge, glad that a DVD version finally came out! Incredible scenery, and the 10 steps shown in the book Horse, Follow Closely. Basically, this DVD is the book in ""living"" form, lots of great commentary by GaWaNi, a great starter DVD to those who are not familiar with Native American Horsemanship history, philosophy or ways of training a horse, and one of the most interesting video's out there. I like that it is now on DVD with a menu so I can select scenes and get right to where I want to be, which was a hassle with the VHS set. If you haven't had the chance to see the DVD's in The Simple Truth About Horses series, check them out as well."
4,Great topic but not what I expected,"I guess I was looking for a book with more information about the stories surrounding Tara and the history of her veneration. I commend her attempt but this is really better for the narrower audience of Buddhist-Gelug practitioners. A non-Buddhist, and even a non-Gelug, is likely to only get so much from this book. The bit at the end about 'emptiness' was actually really good (I thought) and I am glad that she discusses the difference aspects of Tara with a reasonable amount of depth but this has a strong Gelug perspective which I could not really relate to."
3,Not a memoir but sketches of people and places,"Eggleston writes in an amusing, subtly ironic style; the editor of the edition I read completely missed the irony but it's there. He describes pre-war Virginia society, not without some affectionate mockery, and gives sketches of people he knew during the war, from generals to the conscripts in his unit who enlisted out of a Richmond prison. His portrayal of General Stuart is quite good and his portrayal of General Jackson isn't so good. The ex-prisoner Baltimore Irishmen in the battery of which Eggleston was sergeant major are very humorously described. He was present at the siege of Petersburg and talks a little about that as well as about the retreat to Appomattox and the post-war state of lawlessness in the countryside. This doesn't contain much in the way of gory battle scenes but is an amusing and interesting read."
4,Grown Folks Music,"After months of hearing ""So What The Fuss"" it seemed we'd never get the full CD. But now we can say, ""please keep them coming Stevie."" This is not ""Inner Visions"" or ""Talking Book."" And we'll probably never hear anything like ""Songs In The Key Of Life"" again, but this is still Stevie going strong. It's been ten years since ""Conversation Peace"" so let's be glad for this latest offering. And his latest is hardly settling by far. We just find a more mature Stevie, with new things to say, in a brand new Century. Let's savor the moment."
2,Stevie Makes Me Wonder,"First and foremost, I have been a Stevie Wonder fan for over thirty-five years and I mean a big fan. If someone had asked me in the late Eighties or early Nineties who my all-around favorite musican was, I'd have said Stevie Wonder. Today, Stevie is still fabulous in concert, but over the last 15 years, I find that his studio material has been sliding deeper and deeper into the abyss. I can't say that there were more than one or two cuts on A Time to Love that made me want to listen again. For some musicians, this level of songwriting and performance would be fairly well-received, but for Wonder, it's a sign that his best music may be behind him. It just doesn't move me and if this album took ten years to produce, something is not right in the House of Wonder. Having said all that, Stevie is still one of the greatest musicans of all time and even if he never writes another song, his place in history is guaranteed. He will always symbolize the true spirit of Innervision."
3,"1/2 stars--Great, But Could Benefit With A Co-Producer","A TIME TO LOVE, Stevie Wonder's studio first album in ten years, has a lot going for it. Excellent songwriting, gorgeous melodies, glorious arrangements and stellar singing and playing from the Wonder man himself. The ballads ""Moon Blue"", ""From The Bottom Of My Heart"" and ""True Love"", and the mid-tempo ""Sweetest Somebody I Know"" rank right up there with his classics. However, the funkier tunes sound dated except for ""So What The Fuss"" (although a guest appearance by EnVogue would suggest that Stevie still thinks it's 1992). A co-producer such as Raphael Saadiq would have been beneficial to the uptempo tracks on the album."
4,magical,"""I am only 14 and I juss started listening to stevie wonder. He has inspired me so much ever since I seen him on tour. To me this album goes up there with Talking Book and Innervisions. I could only find one song that i hardly understand. But anyway i give this cd a 4 out of 5 stars. It was just like the man...Wonder...."""
4,A Time to Return,"Hold on a minute!! This is not a classic Stevie Wonder album.... I would put it below ""Fulfiligness's First Fianle"" or ""Innervisions"" and definitely below ""Songs in the Key of Life"". The CD in many instances sounds like ""Innervisions"" but there are standout tracks - a ""stonking"" and funky opener, ""Passionate Raindrops"" is alive and delightful,while ""What the Fuss"" is not the top tune of the CD, which was my early fear...it is servicable and funky...but there are better tunes. For me the best tune on the album..in terms of creativity and musicianship must be the title track ""A Time to Love"", a bit reminiscent of ""Livin' for The City"" in terms of intention, it seems that Stevie, ably assisted by india.aire, was just about to fly...when the CD ended. It does leave you wanting more....but 10 years for a new CD? The release date being put back from March until October....Please Stevie...don't make us wait so long until the next one!"
2,Hmmm,"I am A BIG FAN OF STEVIE WONDER. I Love all his music, but this CD just does not do it for me. I have listen to this CD 4 times and I am just not feeling it. SORRY STEVIE THIS ONE DOES NOT DO IT FOR ME. I SEE THE DIRECTION THAT YOU ARE GOING IN, STICK TO WHAT YOU DO BEST.Greg Lassiterwww.misguidedproduction.com"
2,Long-time Fan,"I've been a devoted Stevie Wonder fan since the early 70's but I feel most of the songs on his new album are rather mediocre and somewhat boring (although a couple truly will make you dance!). His voice isn't what it used to be, although he continues to be a master musician. He tries to cram too many lyrics into each song, and only a few of the cuts have memorable melodies. Still, it's good to have him back in the studio recording new songs."
2,Not Great Music,"I am an avid Stevie Wonder fan, however this is NOT the Stevie Wonder of the '70s. I own Songs in the Key of Life, Innervisions, Talking Book, Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants, and Little Stevie Wonder on '45s. (missed ""For Once In My Life"").His voice is still as great as ever, however the songs on this album range from fair to abysmal.Save your money and don't buy this one. Stick to classic Stevie!"
4,Mosaic of background harmonies,"I really liked the mosaic of background harmonies in the song ""My love is on fire"". On my first listening of this cd , that is what caught my ear. I like the way the vocals are arranged and there is a specific chord that the singers hit that is great . Just when I thought that there wasn't any more room for background vocals, some ""ya ya ya""'s appear periodically. That's what I liked the most! I'm a singer/songriter and I produce my own recordings so I find this kind of production work exciting. Thanks Stevie Wonder and company."
4,No Doubt: He's Still Got It,"Stevie will always be for me the ultimate lyricist and rhythm master. No one tops him at this. There is always something intricate and moving to be heard. That is the wonder of Wonder. How Will I Know He Loves Me, just simple words put together as only Stevie can do it. The percussion and lyrics of A Time To Love are riveting. I can't get enough of this entire collection. Ultimately, whether we want to believe it or not, Stevie is driven by his innate need to create music, not the music industry or fans. Although, I'm sure he appreciates us :) His son said recently that Stevie has over 500 songs. If it takes another 10 years for him to share a few more, I'll consider myself lucky and privileged to be a part of his deeply appreciative audience."
5,"Stevie's best since ""Songs In the Key Of Life""","This album's been growing on me ever since I started listening to it about a month ago. I now feel confident in stating that A Time To Love is Stevie Wonder's best album since the classic Songs In The Key Of Life. Sure, he's made a lot of great music since then. In Square Circle, Jungle Fever, and Conversation Peace all had fantastic highs, but, unfortunately, some crushing lows too. ATTL has 15 songs spread out over nearly 1 hour and 20 minutes, really a double album's worth of music when you stop to consider it, and there is not a real clunker to be found. My favorite songs areI Can't Imagine Love Without You, From The Bottom Of My Heart, Passionate Raindrops, and How Will I Know, but there are several other real standouts here. So here's a long delayed ""Welcome Back!"" to the Genius, with a hope that it's not another 10 years before the next album."
3,It Is Not Ready,"Lots of people think they can listen to the new Stevie Wonder album and wrote a knowledgable review using all the popular cliches and sound like they know it all and should be writing for the NY Times.It can't be done. An album like this is like a bottle of fine wine. It has to have a shelf life first. Then, like any bottle of fine wine, needs to properly breath.There is no question that this album is a joy to all of us Stevie fans that have been waiting for 10 years to hear something new. But let's give it the time it needs before we make any judgements. Give it a year, maybe 2, then it can be properly placed into its proper status amongst Stevie's greatest albums. It might be his best. It might be his worst. It is too soon to tell. And I will enjoy listening to it while I wait for it to fully breath."
3,not really,Glad that stevie made a new recording with new material and its nice but not a standout it's more of a less than stevie wonder great record. it's worth a listen but if you can find it in the bargin bin get it. it's not worth full price not really worth it.
4,From The Bottom Of Stevie's Heart,"Nazalost na albumu ima svega samo ne funky zvuka koji nam je doneo singl So What The Fuss koji je i najavio album A Time To Love. Ok tu je ustvari i Please Don't Hurt My Baby, ostalo je samo najblazi soul i nesto sto tezi pop muzici.Zasto se Stevie odlucio za takvu varijantu, ostaje nejasno. Pesme na koje treba obratiti paznju su bozanstvena If Your Love Cannot Be Moved otpevanu sa Kim Burrell i From The Bottom Of My Heart.Ostatak materijala prolazi sasvim pristojno, ali Stivie zar nisi mogao vise funky i pravog soula da nam pruzis?"
2,"""A Time 2 Love"" Not Full of Wonder","Something happened to Stevie between his groundbreaking triad of Talking Book, Innervisions, and Songs in the Key of Life albums until now. A Time 2 Love has glimpses of the genius, but falls short with poor lyrics, tired arrangements, and hookless writing. The best of the bunch ""So What the Fuss"" with Prince on guitar, and ""Positivity"" with Aisha Morris are the only two songs with have some life to them. I can't believe this CD was nominated for six Grammy awards."
2,Second thoughts,"Repeated listenings allow me to moderate the review I posted a while ago. I'm delighed to do it. My original title was ""A Time to Despair."" Make that ""A TIme to Take Stock.""Five of the fifteen cuts are decent -- one or two may even approach greatness -- but whenever the album starts to take flight it crashes back to earth under the weight of songs slow as molasses and twice as syrupy. Ballads have always been the man's undoing. Melodies that are often unmemorable; lyrics so mawkish you can't quite believe your ears. Sure, some have been hits, but still...After all these years, it's way past time for a friend whose opinion he respects to whisper the words the flunkies around him seem afraid to speak: Stevie, ballads just ain't your thing."
4,"Always enjoyable, occassionally thought-provoking","I'm moderately libertarian, so I usually agree with the views expressed in Reason. I enjoy poring over the news summaries and the book reviews, then skimming the articles. Reason isn't essential for me, but I always look forward to it.It's worth mentioning that the whole magazine is now available online at Reason.com."
4,Pretty Good,"For this registered Libertarian, this is a pretty good magazine. Decent articles that are written well and easy to read, as well as being informative. It has been around quite a while and the experience shows (in a positive way)."
1,Reason Doesn't Live Up to it's Name,"Initially, I liked this publication for it's candid exploration of current marijuana laws and the media hype on prescription drugs. It seemed to cut through all the hysteria and present a reasonable point of view. Since then, its pages seem to be filled only with odd articles, boring articles, and one-sided attacks on the current administration. Not reasonable at all, in this reviewer's opinion."
1,LEFT WING LIBERTARIANS,Please avoid Reason. The good work they do is negated by their betrayals and attacks on others in the Liberty movement. Reason needs to fire their senior editors.
1,A yawner of a magazine.,"I let my subscription lapse a few years ago. Unread issues just kept piling up because the magazine had gotten consistently dull. There was also some sloppy writing here and there. The ""Big Fat Fake"" by Fumento in the March 2003 issue was the last straw for me. Gary Taubes refuted everything Fumento had to say. Reason magazine lost credibility.When Reason stops wasting my time with misinformation and predictability, I'll give them another try."
1,a sad case,"I was once a subscriber to Reason. Unfortunately under the current editor it has taken a sharp turn in the wrong direction. At this point, ""free minds and free markets"" is a very misleading tag line and I would have to say the magazine is simply pretending to be something it is not. Several years ago one read of Marxists proclaiming themselves to be libertarians and the existence of the oxymoronic (or just plain moronic) ""left libertarians."" Mr. Welch clearly appears to be of that ilk."
2,Free Markets is not Libertarian,"This is a Libertarian magazine, not a Free Market Keynesian magazine. I will conceed that it is rather well written, compared to most out there."
5,Better balance,This album has perhaps a better blending than any other American avant/RIO band of all the elements that make the style what it is.
3,Unique to a small fault,"3 1/2A joyous (the exception sadly being the album's longest track) minor key romp through technical town, seldom veering these eccentrically complex compositions towards masturbatory intellectualism despite an opportunity to do so at any given fork-road of freak-dom."
3,3stars is rigther:but it's a sloppy version of Don Caballero,"Well they are usually labeled like a weird art rock band, that is more similar to a modern ""rebelled"" and uncoventional band, almost ""punk"" in their proposal and often with the same proposal by experimental artists like Henry Cow, in comparison to a classic prog band... nevertheless you find also clear references to the classic mexican romantic prog genre in this album, such as ICONOCLASTA, from the modern side of their style (in the vein of ""The lamb"" by Genesis ),even though the approach is much more raw and sloppy.Moonsongs"" and ""Possessed"" are the best tracks, by means also of 2 different female singers,but their Gentle Giant oriented tracks-in an acid version of their own- are difficult to take (listen also to their new album ""In extremis""...)You like or you hate them, make your choice !!"
3,this is noise not prog,i can't believe people call this prog this is worse than king crimson and pain of salvation its just noise it sounds awful and they don't shred how can it be porg if the7 don't shred i gave it 3 stars though because the girl i'm stalking loves them and she's going to by my wife even though she doesn't know my name.
1,2 Months old and into the GARBAGE,Since 1/07 purchase this unit frequently shut down during 3 minute microwave use. The top of the machine gets extremely hot perhaps 180-200 degrees. I requested service online and even though I live in central overpopulated NJ I was directed to a 40 minute away pot luck TV service center across state lines in PA. Do yourself a favor and stay away from large Home Rem. chains who do not accept their garbage appliances back.
4,"Red Sundown offers solid plot, good action and acting","Red Sundown is a very good western which featured a fine cast, commendable acting, with adequate suspense and action throughout. Rory Calhoun is excellent in the lead as a man attempting to reform from an outlaw past. Robert Middleton displayed his typical stellar acting as the heavy and Grant Williams is outstanding as Middleton's hired gun. Martha Hyer and Dean Jagger also shine in supporting roles.I was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of Red Sundown. If you enjoy older westerns, you won't be disappointed. The only downside is that it wasn't available on DVD at the time I purchased it, but the VHS quality is still good."
4,Really a good film.,"I too must get on the bandwagon and say THIS IS NOT A BAD MOVIE. Not great, certainly, but a very entertaining one. When this movie first came out, I think too many people (critics) compared it to the book which was a disservice to the film. Seeing it now, we thought it was quite entertaining (two friends joined me) and Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffith were a good match. I would recommend this film to anyone. Maybe time is on its side."
1,To Kill a Book,"This movie version of an excellent book takes no prisoners. It is one of the worst films that I have ever seen. The actors are all miscast, and their acting is even worse. How could so many usually good actors make such a bad movie. It has to be the script, the script, the script. To say this movie is badly directed is an understatement. I am now going to reread the book to refresh my memory of its greatness."
1,This is certainly a comedy,"After reading the book, I knew that there was no way the movie could fill its shoes. But I was interested in the movie nonetheless. I can now say that this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I can not think of a single performance that I would call adequate. Kim Cattrall and Melanie Griffith were laughably bad. Hanks and Willis were horribly miscast. And the ""message"" behind the story is treated in such a heavy handed manner as to make the movie unbearable. I had trouble understanding how someone who made a film this bad could continue to get work directing. If you don't believe how bad this film really is; rent it. At least you you'll have something to complain about."
1,You've got to see it to believe it!,"No matter how bad you think this movie is going to be, it's worse. Melanie Griffith saved it from being the worst movie of all time. By the way, the book is GREAT."
1,HACK!,"Okay, I'm Earth's biggest Tom Hanks fan, but, come on! This is so incredibly boring!!!! Even if this is the last movie on the planet, DON'T!"
3,Better than expected.,"I avoided this movie like the plague for two reasons. 1.) it's rep as a dog of a movie, and 2.) because I read the book -- which franklly didn't do that much for me. But despite the miscasting of Tom Hanks (who is my favorite actor), it definitely was better than I expected. I see now why Melanie Griffith got the best critics' reviews of anyone in the movie. I had to to see it to believe it, but her scenes were excellent. And as a Southerner I found she delivered a good approximation of a Southern accent. But I thought she and Hanks had absolutely no chemistry together. Probably due to his miscasting."
4,Good movie with a bad rep,"This movie got mercilessly flogged by reviewers when it was released. For that reason, I avoided it all these years. Well, that's what I get for being a sheep. This is actually a very enjoyable film. I'm sure it will continue to offend a lot of people, but what doesn't these days? I did read and like Wolfe's novel, and I really thought this was a faithful film version."
5,"The truth shall set you free, and if it doesn't,... LIE LIKE HELL!","I saw this film in the theaters as a teenager having not read or even heard of the book. I really enjoyed it because of the actors, the characters and their backstories. I just love satire. I hadn't even heard of Reverand Al. Now, this movie still amuses me, but on more levels. A year after I saw this film, I took a cinema class in college, where the instructor blamed the trashing of the film on its New York City premiere, where the local reviewers panned the movie for airing their city's dirty laundry. Whether civic pride or an unachievable high standard created by the prestige of the novel are to blame, this film got a bad rap. There's a lot in the film and lots to like, now as then."
1,A complete disappointment,"After reading the book for an English independent reading project, I decided to check the movie out. The movie is so different from the book, and if you have read the book, you must pass over the movie. I ended up sticking out the two hours of this bomb, even though I wanted to shut it off after the first five minutes and go back to the video store to demand my $1.99 back. I would bet Tom Wolfe would be embarassed to say he wrote the book if he saw the movie. Whoever played assistant D.A. Kramer was the worst actor I have ever seen. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE, especially if you have read the book, which is terrific."
3,OK,The movie was ok but the book was great. It was long but was a great read. There were too many difference from the book to the movie.
1,The worst book-to-movie movie ever made!,"Do not bother with this movie--it is so bad, it defies description. Those who have given it anything more than one star (and the ""system"" won't let you give a movie NO stars--which is what this one deserves) obviously did not read the book. (Melanie Griffith can't act when she's type-cast, so how is she suppose to pull off a seductive Latina?) ORDER THE BOOK instead (the book rates FIVE ***** stars!)"
3,Not as bad as many think,"I rented this film purely on it's reputation. This film is considered a gigantic turkey, which is an embarrassment to those involved in it. True, the Bonfire of the Vanities isn't a great film, but it's not terrible. I did find the casting puzzling. Tom Hanks, as fine an actor as he is, is woefully miscast as Sherman McCoy. He did not give a believable performance for a moment. As for Bruce Willis. Well, he is a mediocre actor at best, and didn't leave an impression. Morgan Freeman is annoying. He was probably just told to shout. Melanie Griffith is rather good, showing herself to be adept at comedy, and F. Murray Abraham too is good as a stereotyped Jew. The story is at times thin on the ground, but remains interesting enough. The direction is impreesive, but you really wonder why a director of Brian dePalma's calibre wanted to make a movie like this. An amiable film, but nothing more."
1,Terrible Adaptation,This movie was probably the worst adaptation of a book I have ever seen in my entire life. De Palma missed EVERYTHING that made Tom Wolfe's book so incredible. The fact that this movie is billed as comedy should be enough to deter those who enjoyed the book from watching it. Absolutely terrible film. Read the book and don't see the movie.
1,Deadening version of the wonderful Wolfe novel,"How could a movie based on a novel that was so hilarious, biting, ironic, involving, fresh, and downright loveable become so extremely horrendous, unfunny, and boring? Well, that's because EVERYTHING here is WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! All the stars are miscast, the direction is lackadaisical, the pacing is elephantine and lumbering, and the screenwriter drained all the irony and wit out of the original source to give us an unwatchable waste of film."
3,Pretty good,"Many people say that this film... and that it's really bad but I can't really agree with them. The cast's good and I thought Melanie Griffith did a good job portraying Maria and even though Beth Broderick, as Caroline Heftshank, had a small role I thought she did it great. Her scenes are among the funniest in the film.No, the film can't be compared with the book, which is great, and the film is indeed very different but does that make it bad? No, not in my opinion. The film is simply entertaining, something you watch and enjoy for the moment. The first scene is very beautiful and I must say that it's one of the best opening scenes I have ever seen.Lastly, I want to say that this is the kind of film that gets better for every time you watch it. So if you didn't like it the first time you saw it, give it another chance because every time you watch it, you will discover something new."
4,Quite good in its own right,"I saw the movie before reading the book, and so I judged it on its own merits instead of by how well it compared to the book. By that standard, it's quite decent, more ""light"" than the book, but nothing wrong with that. Later, I read the book, and enjoyed the detail, the craftsmanship, but let's face it, you don't compress a 600 page book into a movie and expect it to be the same. And, quite frankly, I MUCH preferred the movie ending. Morgan Freeman wrapped everything up with a nice speech at the end, whereas in the book, the ending was horribly done and seemed to just fall apart."
1,What a Mess.,"So sad. A great 5 star novel turned into a 1 star movie. Totally miscast in every character. If anyone in a Holywood studio is out there, this is one movie that needs to be REMADE, so that its true to the novel."
3,"OK Movie, Except for Speech at the End","This movie is alright, Melanie Griffith is gorgeous and fun, and Tom Hanks is at his early Nineties light comedy best. Morgan Freeman's speech at the end is lame, but not a bad way to spend a couple hours."
2,"It Should Have Worked, In Theory...",".... but, even with all the great names associated with this one, it could have been much, much better. For one, it felt too intimate for Noo Yawk. I mean, when things happen there, it seems like it is written large, you know? (When Sting gives a free concert in Central Park, well, that's massive, you know?)...and Tom Wolfe's book did have that feel, but it lost it in the translation. The film could have more excessive moments...I didn't get the feel that there was much of a rallying to have this Master of the Universe's head on a platter. Crowd scenes were skimpy and controlled. The DA just did not seem to be oily enough to me. To their credit, Melanie Griffith and Morgan Freeman played their respective roles well, but what was up with Hanks and Willis? They sleepwalked through the entire thing. I expected more from the two. Read Tom Wolfe's sweeping novel instead. It is truly great..."
3,Maybe this was the less convincing film in the career of De Palma!,"The bestseller of Tom Wolfe well deserved a better treatment, much more incisive and caustic gaze. Maybe Robert Altman seemed to be the most indicated filmmaker to direct it, due the secondary plots demanded to emerge with major firmness.Something was wrong with De Palma; perhaps he did not feel comfortable with this material. There is very stylized approach and the character definitively strand in the mere anecdote.Consider for instance, the level of the cast: Tom Hanks, Morgan Freeman two future Oscar winners) Melanie Griffith and Bruce Willis; the script possessed enough force to ignite the screen, but...I really hope someday when De Palma decides to make his personal self biography, we know about what was going on behind stage."
2,not great,"I am a huge Tom Hanks fan but I have to say this is one of his worst movies he made. I rarely fall asleep when I watch a movie but I've not made it through this movie yet in one sitting. A real yawner that moves at a glacial pace. If you're not picky about your entertainment, then this movie is right down your street."
2,Terrible movie,The movie is full of gratutious profanity and over-the-top stereotypes. Melanie Griffith looked great and did some good acting. Tom Hanks was so-so.
4,An ambitious effort,but come on... name me 2 other films that have attempted social criticism and commentary to anywhere near the extent that this one does. It's rough to name many.In my mind this film got panned because people didn't want to look at how banal and superficial their lives REALLY are. Is it flawed... certainly but I really enjoyed it. It has enough comedy to keep you entertained while taking a hard look at some very serious yet unpleasant issues.Plus I just have to add that I don't think i've ever seen a Melanie Griffith film that to me would rate less than 4 stars. But by the same token I don't own any of her films because neither are any of them 5 star films but they're all good.
3,"Not as good as the book, but passible","Yes, Tom Hanks was miscast as McCoy, and the film lacked the bite the book had, but come on-most of us see movies to be entertained, and on these merits, this movie was entertaining enough. The highlight of the movie was Morgan Freeman, a fair, no-nonsense judge who just happened to be black."
4,Superb! DePalma at his best.,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The characters in the film seem to be characatures of all the loathsome qualities of man. The characters Sherman McCoy, Maria Ruskin, and Peter Fallow, appitimize the underhanded dark side of New York's ""upper"" class. Absolutly outstanding cinimatography by Vilmos Zsigmond. A must see for all DePalma fans."
3,A fine satire,"A lighthearted, overtly comedic adaptation of a much more profound literary source, this film is not very bad if one considers it in its own right. The characters are well cast, and some scenes (like the judges climatic courtroom speech)are clearly a mockery that shouldn't be taken seriously. The movie has a fine soundtrack, and the locations are occasionally great. No masterpiece, but no bottom of the barrel, either."
1,Dreadful Adaptation of the Book,I read this book and looked forward with great anticipation to the movie. I haven't been so disappointed in a movie in years. None of the characters were sympathetic.. I began to wish they'd all get killed off...
2,COLOR PURPLE DVD,"THE DVD I PURCHASED SEEMED HOME MADE. IT HAD NO LABEL AND HALFWAY THROUGH THE MOVIE IT STOPPED AND A MESSAGE APPEARED TO FLIP OVER DVD TO CONTINUE. THE QUALITY WAS OK BUT, THE DVD SEEMED LIKE A PIRATED COPY. AS A HUGE FAN OF THIS MOVIE I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE DVD."
4,Unforgettable but,"As a white person, I tried first reading the book but found the ""black"" English so difficult to wade through, I took the ""easy"" way out & saw the movie. It took me about 4 times to make myself see it through to the end. At the beginning I found the scenes of incest too disturbing so I needed a break. Then the scenes of lesbianism so bothered me I needed another break.Then the brutality so bothered me I needed another ""break"". A great & memorable film but I wonder why the men were all depicted in such brutish manner...sort of a stereotype that is racially untrue. I thought all the acting was superb & we all know Oprah is a briliant actress from this & her other performances. I just wish they might have not depicted all the white people in the film as sadistic Nazis.When I heard they were producing a musical on Broadway of The Color Purple, I found it mind boggling.Will they next be producing a joyous musical about the HOLOCAUST?"
5,Great Movie,"no problems with the DVD. Great movie.I hadn't seen it before, deffinately worth the price.I would highly recommend it"
5,Color Purple Blu Ray,"I have the Color Purple on DVD.It is a beautiful production both in colors and clarity.I purchased the ""Color Purple"" in blu ray for my wife.It really was Outstanding X2,in both color,sound,and clarity.Just great and about as good as it gets in Blu-Ray.The only other Blu Ray Movies I purchased that was as good in quality of sound and picture was ""To Catch a Thief"" with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.I thought he was in my living room,and a Live Broadway Show on Blu Ray called ""Julie Andrews in Victor Victoria"" My wife and I saw this on Broadway.This Blu Ray of Live Broadway theatre was better then sitting in the audience.It is by far the very very very best in Blu Ray Quality of anything I have ever seen.I am talking about the Blu Ray Quality in sound and clarity!! Nothing comes close,but you have to like this musical and Julie Andrews.Take Care."
3,i didn't no whoopi could act like that and very funny danny TIME TO GO!!!,"this movie was very good one of the best movies of the 80s it felt like they continued the tradition of roots because it was an black movie of the early 1900s in the south when slavery still existed but it was shown much until the middle of the movie with great acting was great comedy and emotion from whoopi, danny, oprah, and other cast that was in it made me laugh the movie ended perfectly after whoopi suffered like tina turner by the abuse from danny who was the 1800s version of ike turner he would beat her good if he wasn't happy when whoopi met her son and daughters after not seeing then in 20 years was like walking on air"
1,"Syrupy, awful.","This film is one of the toughest celluloid experiences to sit through. No respect for the (infinately worthier) source material. It is ironic that Spielberg attempts a ""Griffiths-like"" approach to this subject as it dessimates any possibility of true insight into the machinations of Walker's more resigned, cerebral literary experiences. Strangely enough, she condoned Spielberg's requisite butchering. Interesting. Spielberg is a technically astute filmmaker, masterful at grabbing an aesthetically appealing image, arranging shots from strict pre-production storyboarding, layering on Quincy Jones' cloying score and hearing the coffers rattle with cinema punters' coins and cash, but this project he should have left to someone else. As one critic put it 'it either grabs you emotionally or leaves you cold'. It left me positively glacial."
1,Here's all you have to know about the movie,To understand the film and the book all you have to know is:Black women--PerfectWomen--OKBlack men--SubparWhite men--The devil incarnateWhat can I say--cardboard characters who's main goal is to pass us a MESSAGE.Read Alice Walker's daughter's book to better understand how the mind of this bitter woman with an agenda operates.
5,As promised,My movie was delivered in a timely fashion and packaged as promised. I appreciate the care and would use this provider again.
4,The Color Purple,I love the movie because the contents was not filled with alot of sex and strong language. It made you laugh and cry. It is good
4,Earnest but long,"An ambitious drama based on Alice Walker's acclaimed novel. Two black sisters, who are very close to each other, are forced to separate, and throughout the movie we follow the life of one of them, Celie (Whoopi Goldberg). She is mistreated by her husband (Danny Glover), who refuses to allow Celie to have any contact with her sister Nettie. Later in the movie we discover that he has hidden all the letters Nettie has written Celie - years worth of them. Celie discovers them by accident after Nettie has become a missionary in Africa, and stands up to Glover. The movie is too long (152 minutes) and although most parts are good, others contain director Spielberg stock mannerisms (singing, emphasis on visual effects rather than substance of characters) that are annoying. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards - it got none."
5,This is a touching film,i love this movie from begining to in the is movie was excellent i love this movie.
4,"Wonderful film, but...","This is a wonderful film, and I was looking forward to the DVD version. Perhaps I got it too early in the history of DVD, as my copy has the film on two sides. Hopefully, there will be newer pressings of this film with a single-sided, dual-layer version. That would make this film perfect. Five stars for the film; minus one star for the interruption."
5,the color purple.,I thought this movie was well thought out... the first time i watched it i was inlove with it.Oprah and Woppie are very good actor's...I could watch this movie everyday its so good.!!!!
3,Have you really never seen this?,"Most women have seen ""The Color Purple."" Most women in my mother's generation love it. I guess by the time I saw it as a young woman, it was no longer so shocking or sensational. This movie does feature the best performances ever given by Danny Glover, Whoppi Goldberg, and Oprah Winfrey. Watch it if you have somehow never seen it."
2,Turn me over,"Another classic film well worth watching. However, with this DVD it stops during the viewing and you must turn the DVD over to continue watching. Why? This is not only a disappointment and interruption of the film, it is unnecessary. The seller could have been upfront about this, but was not."
2,The Color Purple,3131-HST The Color Purple was an exciting book. It shed light on the fact that black women were treated in the early 1900's. This book deserves 2 stars.
1,"a movie ordered and never received it, but was charged for it",I ordered a movie and never received it. I ordered the movie on feb. 27th 20011. I was told I would receive it between march 4th and the 21st. It is now April 1st still no movie! I have emailed them several times and there has been no attempt to contact me or rectify this situation!! They stole my money! My advice DO NOT order from them!!
3,"i didn't no whoopi could act like that and danny was very funny when he said ""TIME TO GO!!!""","this movie was very good one of the best movies of the 80s it felt like they continued the tradition of roots because it was an black movie of the early 1900s in the south when slavery still existed but it was shown much until the middle of the movie with great acting was great comedy and emotion from whoopi, danny, oprah, and other cast that was in it made me laugh the movie ended perfectly after whoopi suffered like tina turner by the abuse from danny who was the 1800s version of ike turner he would beat her good if he wasn't happy when whoopi met her son and daughters after not seeing then in 20 years was like walking on air because everything was peaceful and everyone looked to be very happy there is some old skool catchy church movie in the mix"
5,Black History,"This Story tells of another way of life. It is based on Alice Walker's novel. Celie turns inward and shares her grief( she must bear being forced into a marriage with a Man she call's ""Mister"") with God who allows these things and many more to effect her attitude about LIFE. Learn about her ""Mother"" and ""Father"" towards the end and how Albert does the Right thing and gets approval for her Children to return from their Missionary work in Africa. The music will move you and you will feel the tears Celie certainly must have shed. A MASTER PIECE. You have to watch this during Black History Month."
4,GRRREAT!,The Color Purple is my favorite film of all time. Wonderful story and brilliantly acted. The one thing I do think you should know is to buy the Special Edition DVD instead if you're a true fan.
5,A Gem that the Oscars Missed,"I am still disappointed that ""The Color Purple"" did not receive the Oscar in 1986. Not only was the cast OUTSTANDING, but the story hit to the core of so many issues and ills, not only in black america, but in america in general. I have two copies of the movie and still watch it when it comes on television. It is an American classic. I read the book, which has NOTHING on the movie. Steven Spielberg absolutely captured the heart and spirit of issues during a time when women were property and had no voice.The struggle of Celie to find herself and peace, when she was raped by her ""father"", had her infant children taken from her, being forced to marry a man who did not want to marry her and then lost her sister because of her adulterous husband's ""pride"", touches the lives of every woman who has ever loved.Outstanding performances by Oprah Winfrey, Whoopie Goldberg, Danny Glover, Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar, Akosua Busia and the phenominal Desreta Jackson (young Celie)."
5,God is trying to tell you something,"I absolutely love this movie. It's one that you have to watch with an open mind and heart to be able to catch all of the lessons its trying to teach. I think God does get a tad bit upset when people take his blessings and gifts for granted. It also tries to tell us that in life, despite appearances, everyone is looking for something, and no one has it all. Most important is the fact that in everything that going on in these times, God is definitely trying to tell us something"
2,good but lacks punch,"Goldberg did an outstanding job. However, if you wanna see a slow pace, depressed movie this one's for you."
1,Color Purple,"The DVD that I received was defective. I played it, but only half the movie was available or apparent. It kept goind back to the beginning. It was impossible to enable to correct the video. I would like to get a refund and sent this one back to NETDEALZ."
5,Instant Gratification!,"We saw a retrospect on Oprah's show of ""The Color Purple"" with many of the stars of the movie. It made me want to see the movie again. I ordered it on Amazon and got it within a few days. We watched about half and fell asleep- nothing to do with the quality of the movie! We've just been having a lot of construction done in the house and were exhausted. We will go back and finish it. This review, though, should be more about the fact that the movie arrived quickly and in great condition! Thanks!"
5,Excellent Blu Ray DVD,"Since ""The Color Purple"" has been my favorite movie of all time, I just had to get it on BluRay disc now that I have recently upgraded to BluRay from regular DVD. I was concerned that since it is an older movie (from somewhere around 1984), that the Blu Ray disc would not make a difference. BUT, it does. The sound and visual properties are noticeably better on BluRay. I recommend this disc to everyone."
4,the color purple,"Its A good movie but it,s one I belesve you have to watch the whole movie to enjoy. It get's more interesting asit goe's along."
1,damaged,this movie was ordered twice and each time it stopped at scene 8 I think all dvds should be reviewed by seller before selling
5,she loves this movie,"I surprises a friend with this movie for her birthday, it was all she talked about leading up to getting it, when she got it in the mail she started to cry, she loves it more then the gift her husband got her, lol"
2,The advertis is misleading customer,The bar is not chrome finished. It is blue paint. I like to replace it but they did not have replacement. The advertisement is misleading customer.
4,Nice piece,I really like this stool. It was simple to put together and is quite attractive. I recommend putting wood glue in joints as well as the included screws especially when installing the arm rests.
3,Disappointed,"The bar stools are very nice, but unfortuntly one arrive damaged and it would have cost more to send it back. When items arrive in boxes that you have to put then they should arrive undamaged. Be careful."
4,Looks Expensive,"Ordered 2 of these for the kitchen counter, hate that they are from China, but impressed with the quality, the detail, and ease of assembly. They are sturdy and well finished. Bummed that I had to pay identical shipping for each one, but they arrived timely and in good condition. They look like stools costing 3 times as much as I paid on Amazon. Each one has a slight woble on hard surface but it is barely noticeable, I'll fix it if it ever bothers me. Overall I'm very pleased."
4,Good chairs with good customer service!,"""I ordered four chairs. The chairs are of very good quality and exactly as advertised. All four chairs were missing two bolts so I went to Home Depot to get replacements. I asked for and received an immediate $5.00 credit from the vendor. One chair had two right arms and no left arm. The vendor immediately shipped a left arm from California by Fed-ex ground so I received it one week later."""
4,Oak Bar Stools,"These are great, easy to put together, good and sturdy. The only thing wrong with them is they are about 2 inches too tall but from reading other reviews I knew that before I bought them, otherwise they look great and are very comfy."
1,please dont waste our money..,"I ordered four of these barstools, it took us about two hours each to assemble, they are very wobbley very unstable, we had the stools less than a week when we dicided to return them but the company refused to take them back because we had already assembled them, I hadto file a disbute with our credit card company. #1. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT #2.DONT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY..."
1,Beware do not buy,"At first i thought the stools were good but then the leg screws kept coming loose and continually have to be tightened , i guess some lock tight might solve that problem, but now the leather on the back rest has come loose from the wood and i see no way to fix that, i have 2 stools and it happen to both of them and the usage has been light, i contacted Athomemart but all they are willing to do is sell me new back rests"
1,Not as described,"Description indicates they are leather... more like leather color, it is vinyl. Color indicates dark expresso yet arrives medium to medium light. I should have purchased somehting local....."
5,Great Bar Stools,"We bought 4 of these bar stools for our new house. These are just the right height for our double bar and we did not have to pay extra to get the ""extra tall"" bar stools that most sites require (seat is 32"" high). The bar stool is very easy to put together and takes about 10 minutes. The leather material is black - not brown in case anyone is wondering. These bar stools look very expensive and are a perfect match for our kitchen. I would recommend this item to anyone wanting a great bar stool."
4,Monte Carlo Bar Stool,The bar stool is a solidly made furniture item and is well finished.there were two small issues which we were able to remedy on site.the stools were easy to put together with clear instructions and sufficient hardware to complete the project
1,Beautiful but screws are a problem,"These stools look great but the screws do not stay tight. After repeated tightening and finally a cracked leg occurring while sitting on one, I bought ""L"" brackets and secured the legs to the foot rest/seat support. It has worked well, but not sure what to do about the arms that are now coming loose. The price of the stool is great but after the cost of the brass brackets (can't put ugly, cheap brackets on beautiful stools), I could have bought more expensive stools that don't fall apart."
2,Monte carlo bar stool,The chairs look good However it had a big Crack on the back side.I have assembled it and now dont know what to do.I would suggest not to buy Furniture from amazon.
3,Stool review,"This stool is very handsome and sturdy. However, I had the same problem as another reviewer, namely that the swivel was very stiff, compared to other stools I've purchased for exactly the same price. I've solved the problem with WD40 and oil applied to the bottom of the chair at the mechanism which deals with the rotation of the chair. Alas, it swivels alot better."
5,My Hometown!,"This was like reliving my youth! Well written. I sank into it like an old well worn sofa and became a teenager again! Square dances, cake walks - so many happy memories!"
2,Nothing Special,"There are a ton of eating guides about New York. And this one gets lost in the crowd. The descriptions of the restaurants are brief and vague. What I thought was going to be a guide to the affordable culinary gems, was merely a list of cheap restaurants with little effort spent on separating ""cheap and good"" from ""just cheap""."
5,A key point of departure,"This book serves as node in a network to other research and curriculum related research and activity. I found Beane's references to other influential works extremely helpful. In particular I enjoyed following the historical roots of curriculum integration that he delineates in this book. While it took some time to find the works of L. Thomas Hopkins, I am finding them extremely informative, particularly Integration:It's Meaning and Application. This work connects well to most anything written regarding Problem Based Learning (PBL) and connects well to other writings such as the 1995 ASCD yearbook, Toward a Coherent Curriculum and Arthur Applebee's Curriculum as Conversation. Beane definitely will leave the reader with lots to think about when pondering the complexities of curriculum."
2,Not what I expected,"I read the description and reviews for this book. I chose it because my husband and I are trying to conceive and I'm interested in the spiritual component. This book is mostly about abortion and what happens to the soul when it's aborted. Interesting, but I want to have a baby, not abort a baby. The description should be clearer. Even the back cover of the book doesn't reference abortion and yet it is discussed throughout the book."
3,Overdubs ruin the natural magic between these amazing artists,"I am a long time Joe Pass fan - his Virtuoso #3 was my introduction to the world of jazz and improvisation and I have since accumulated almost every recording of his I can find. His ability to accompany and add just the right lines in an ensemble is incredible.On this recording a decision was made to add overdubbed fills and solos over his characteristic solo style, and it often just doesn't feel right. I can only hypothesize that his playing needs the give and take of a live musician in real time to play off of, and the immovable previous recording gives the overdubbed parts a sterility very uncharacteristic of the rest of his catalogue.Don't get me wrong, there are some tremendous musical moments on this, but they would be more intimate and satisfying without the overdubbed part.Dont miss ""Take Love Easy"" with Ella!"
5,very good,"If you need a metal cut off saw that has large capacity, is fast, and leaves a smooth face buy this saw."
1,Cheap and poorly designed,"I've tried planting three kinds of plants in this planter indoors. All have died. I bought another self-watering planter at a garden store and in stark contrast, they are doing fine (Mesa Round Planter, 12"" Blue).I think the problem is that the ""strip"" at the bottom provides inadequate water to the soil when a plant is growing in it, making it tempting to water from the top, which is not a good idea since there is no drainage at the bottom. The lack of drainage at the bottom makes putting this planter outdoors a disaster and I think results in too little aeration for the roots."
3,Not what it looked like,This was a disappointment I wanted a good self watering planter for lemon trees but theses do not work well
2,Ordered again,"I first ordered one pair, and ordered a second pair after trying them on; in a different color. I did not know that the soles are painted, they do not seem to be leather, but rather a man made material (CHINA), which wears off! This is not good. The fit is o.k. The leather is not the best.Johnston & Murphy is a good brand name, but this does not measure up.Are they knock offs?"
4,Sweet regency Romance,"I also read this book in the 70's. A couple of years ago something made me think of it and I ordered it from Amazon. I enjoyed it again though I agree with the above reviewer that the heroine was too independent for that era. HOWEVER, considering her background and treatment by her family I could certainly understand her attitude. It was a very sweet book and touched my emotions, which is what I want from a romance. In many ways Rebecca Danton books could probably be considered YA and are rather simplistic but I enjoyed several of them. Star Sapphire was my favorite and I also enjoyed Fire Opals."
4,Genuine eroticism,"Genuinely erotic photographs of people who appear to enjoy what they are doing, which is to say each other mostly. The models are far from homogenous in appearance, approach or predilection. This is a nice small book for readers who like to keep their own business a little bit private. Chapters are defined by hair colour e.g. Redheads often inaccurately. The majority of photos are B&W so the actual colour is irrelevant anyhow. This is a mild criticism though. Another gem from the EPS."
1,Not my style,"If you consider opening pink bits to be a competitive sport, or if you think object A in orifice B presents a woman at her most alluring, you'll love this. That's not my style, though. Somehow, I'm not surprised that Wilkins also presentedReal Women, which I didn't like either.-- wiredweird"
1,Was the author working in the dark too?,This is one of the most sophomoric books I have ever read. I kept waiting for the plot to become a little more intricate and was left disappointed. It had so much potential but became bogged down with name dropping and an elementary writing style.
5,Working in the Dark worked for me!!!!!!!!,"The first thing that drew me to this book was the cover, then the title made me want to know what the sister on the cover was working. From page number one I was taken into the world of corporate america at its finest. The main character was not to be broken or punked. She stood for what she believed in.Working in the Dark was one of the best books I have read in a long time. It takes a lot for me to say a book is good and this one is high on my list. I even went out and bought all my friends a copy so that we all could talk about it.Good job Yvonne, I can't wait for the next book."
5,Energizing and Inspiring!,"This books explores the struggles and triumphs encountered in one's personal, professional and Spiritual life. It is a very realistic novel that gives readers something to take with them. The author's use of Scripture and powerful proverbs are inspiring. It is a book you can't put down and it inspires you to keep pressing on - as the character Gladys puts it when she said ""you just have to lift yourself up and not bow to your nights."" Thank you Yvonne Grays Nathane for a great work!"
5,Lighting the way,"""Working in the Dark"" by first time novelist Yvonne Gray Nathane, sheds a blinding light on the corporate culture of the late 80's and 90's. Set in the city of Chicago, Nathane's story takes one down familiar streets on the southside, and expense restuarants downtown.This story gives voice to many ladder crawlers throughout the nation. From beginning to end the story reads like a screenplay; hopefully in the future we all may be viewing ""Working in the Dark"" in the dark of a theatre and applauding the wit, spirit and guts of the heroine."
2,SO-SO,"This book is a reproduction of a manual with new cover art work. The quality of the copying could have been better. Some photos are less than ideal and overall, just not very crisp."
5,Great book,Nice book for anyone interested in what a flight manual looked like from back in the day (from a historical stand-point...) Reasonable price too.
3,Copy of a copy of an original,"I was so excited when this arrived. It had a nice, shiny, new cover, with labeling from Lockheed and ""restricted"" on the front, so it appeared very legit.After opening it, though, my excitement disappeared somewhat. The entire manual, while still being very official, appears to be a copy of a scanned document, not a direct copy of the original document. You can see pixellation of smaller text and charts. Very small writing is virtually unreadable. Graphics with labeled items are hard to distinguish.While it is very cool to have the ""original"" pilot's flight manual in-hand, I would have expected a bit better quality from the product's description. For someone who just wants to have a bit of nostalgia, this is a perfectly fine product. However, for a serious historian or someone wanting to really research the minute details of the P-38, the product is a bit lacking due to the quality of the reproduced images."
4,Rock Italian style,"Gianna Nannini is a talented Italian Rock star whose ""I Maschi"" from this CD has been featured in the movie ""Il ladro di bambini"" (stolen children). Her raspy voice is her trademark and never gets tiring. I have four of her CDs and continue to search for more. Anyone who like this one will also like her CD ""Dispetto."" Ciao."
5,"This story screams ""MAKE ME INTO A MOVIE!""","This novel contains a great mixture of mystery, humor and sexual energy. The story takes place in Mexico and involves scandalous deeds commited by important political officials. Many corresponding events occur and all are described vividly and flawlessly.This book would make a great movie!"
4,"LOVE the cooler, not the latches","Cooler is FANTASTIC. We use it for all of our tailgates (40-160 people). We strap the whole thing down on the back of the truck and make people pull their drinks out through the window. One cooler of ice/beer will keep beer cold from 7 AM until 9 PM, even with continual adding of warm cans (we go through about 20-30 cases per tailgate). GREAT product.The latches on the other hand are terrible. If metal ones can be ordered as replacements, that's definitely the way to go. We've broken two latches already this year.Unfortunately someone stole the cooler off the truck last weekend, so we had to downgrade to the 150 qt.SIDENOTE: Costco sells this during the summertime for about 50% of what you can find it for online."
1,Igloo 165 quart cooler,"I bought this cooler 1 year ago. The first time I used it, one of thelatched cracked and broke. I should have called Igloo right away, but I put it off (my fault). We used it again for a Halloween party without incident. The third time we used it for a Memorial Day party, the other latch broke. I checked with Igloo, and they want $3.99 each for each latch, $5.95 shipping, and $4.00 for handling to replace two clearly defective pieces of small plastic. This cooler is good at keeping things cold, but due to the low quality and horrible design of the latches and hinges, and the over the top cost to correct the issue, I am sure I will never purchase another Igloo product. Note that this cooler has never left my house, all use has been at home, so the damage was not caused by transport."
1,Great Capacity and Insulation but has some issues with quality,"I really like the capacity and insulation characteristic of this cooler. However, I am not crazy about the plastic parts like the hinges and latches. If it were made of metal, it would have been much better.Another issue that I have is the design of the handles. When I attempted to carry the cooler with a full load of ice, the handle broke. The four screws used to secure the handle were stripped out of the cooler. It would have been nice if the cooler was design to carry more weight considering the size of it."
5,The perfect movie in an imperfect DVD.,"What the Godfather started Goodfella perfected. There will be movies that are better than Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and Lord of the Rings, but there will never, ever, be a movie that can top Goodfella.Unfornutely this amazing movie is paired with an insultingly bad DVD. As if being devoided of features isn't bad enough, it is also a flip disc to boot!! Why isn't there a Superbit or special edition version of this modern classic!?"
5,Super smashing great,"This is by far the best of the awesome Robert de Niro films, the best collaboration between De Niro and Scorcese, and the best film of the last 25 years. Hell, the best film ever made, lets call it what it is! Great."
3,"5 Star Movie, 2 star DVD","A movie this great deserves a special edition DVD with more than a couple of trailers. Plus, you have to turn the DVD over at a certain point in the movie. I would wait for the re-issue, becase I'm sure that's gotta be in the works. Hopefully they have plans for all Scorsese movies. All the DVD's are bad, with the exception of the special edition of Taxi Driver."
5,THE BEST FILM OF THE 90'S!!!!,"An absolutely brillant masterpiece from America's greatest living filmmaker. The acting, dialogue, cinematography, editing, use of music and narrative structure are stunning. I admire this movie just a tad bit more than The Godfather (as great as that film is). Next to Taxi Driver, this is Scorsese's best effort. I think it's a crime the Oscars failed to recognize this as the Best Picture of 1990. That one still burns me. At any rate, this is one of my all time favs. and my choice for the best film of the nineties."
5,the most realistic mob movie ever/scorsese was on target.,"Goodfellas is the greatest movie ever..Personally, being 100% Italian and growing up in Brooklyn and Long Island, i had the chance to live very close to that lifestyle. I had seen many of the real life wiseguys that the actors played through my uncle.EVERYTHING about the movie is right on target.Especially the Long Island scenes. it looks exactly like Long Island.Rockville Centre to be exact cause that's where Henry's house is when Karen says,""Watch the wall with the rock..."" I cant say enough about this movie. Martin Scorsese= greatest movie mind EVER....thanx 4 ur time....."
5,The truth is always the best story,"This is a true story about the man who went public about the mob - how they operate, how they ignore the law, who they own and how power corrupts even those who have enjoyed it all their lives. Great flick for anyone who wants to know how criminals function in America."
1,Goodfellas,"Item I purchased was a gift, sent it off, then found out it stopped in the middle and there was nothing after that. Replaced it at a local major store."
2,Poor Quality,"The DVD would flutter and not work right in my player, plus it was on two sides of the dvd requiring the disc to be turned over in the middle of the movie. I wish I would have spent a few bucks more.."
1,The movie won't play,"I was getting into the film it was my first time watching it... But... After playing 19 chapters it stopped playing... It was only a one sided disk. I tried to flip it over just to make sure they didn't invent some thing where I can play it on a colored DVD side. Once the kid gets shot after being shot in the foot I get screwed. It is just that I bought a cheep 15 dollar Scorsese collection of good fellas, aviator, mean streets, and the departed? I'm slightly pissed. Bearly even one hour of film."
1,What is this 2-sided DVD crap?,"A great movie, but I almost fell over when I discovered I would have to get up in the middle of the movie and flip the disc over. It ruins the whole experience. What's up with that?"
1,"Goodfellas is a flipper, of all the rotten luck!!!!",An excellent way to ruin an INCREDIBLE movie is to put it on dvd and then make me have to get up and flip the damn thing halfway through. I don't have to do that with The Deer Hunter which is 3hrs long. I honestly think that you ruin the whole feel of the movie in those few seconds. And finally isn't this the reason most of us avoided buying laserdisc players?
3,"Great Movie, Bad Packaging","I recommend to buy Goodfellas (Two-Disc Special Edition) directly and skip this cheaper version.This movie is a classic, yet Warner Bros does not value its customers at all. Once again, they put up for sale a crappy DVD packaging, only for later release a better version and make you buy it again just because you weren't satisfied with the first one. This version has only one disk which is double sided. That is not the problem, though. The problem is that it stops in the middle of the movie and you have to get up and turn it around because the second half of the movie is on the other side. Kind of reminds me of the old audio-cassettes.At any rate, the two-disk version does not experience this and has a lot more extras, you'll be much better off."
2,Goodfellas DVD,"I ordered this DVD & was very happy with the quick delivery. Unfortunatly the DVD would not work in any of my players, but that can happen to anyone. I will try again."
5,5 stars,Goodfellas is an absolute classic. What more do I need to say. This is one of my all time favorite movies hands down. Great acting and a great plot. If you haven't watched this movie you must have lived in a closet your whole life.
3,GoodFellas Review,Good movie but don't like the fact that I have to flip the DVD over to watch the rest of the movie.
1,"Where is the ""Special Edition DVD?""","Six year later, still no ""Special Edition DVD?"" What's going on? Goodfellas is one of my favorite movie of all time! I still got the laserdisc version!Terminator 2: Judgment Day is the only movie in history to receive four different editions??? The first DVD is from Image, the second DVD is from Artisan, the third DVD? remember the ""Ultimate Edition"" and finally the ""Extreme Edition"" I want to scream at the big wig at Warner Bros!!! Where is the so-called 2 disc Special Edition DVD??? It's about time?"
2,"Greatest Movie, Bad DVD!","If you want to watch a one of the greatest Mob Movies of all time get this Movie! It is no doubt worth the money to own a great movie like this. But if your looking for bonus material or good special features, Fagettaboutit! it come in a cheap plastic case and you have to turn the disc over to watch the rest of the movie. I gave this 2 stars for the dvd, but the movie i give 5 stars. Deniro and Pesci are great!"
4,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD","The movie itself stands on its own. You go to Blockbuster and rent a movie if you want to watch it. You buy the DVD because it has great picture quality and features.So, my review is about the DVD itself.The first and biggest negative is the fact that it is on two sides of the DVD. There is nothing more annoying than having to flip the DVD halfway through the movie. There really isn't much else on there. For me, seeing a grainy theatrical trailer isn't very exciting. It gets a 4 only because the film itself is so good."
4,WHAT!,I just knew the gods were messing with me when they took one of the most perfectly stylized and directed films ever and ruined it by making it so that you have to turn it over. Who ever is responcible for this travesty must make ammends. I wanted to cry when realized this was the case.
3,GREAT MOVIE/SORRY DVD,"When you compare a movie like the Matrix and Goodfellas, Goodfellas wins tenfold. However, when you compare the same movies on a DVD, they are again night and day, only in the favor of The Matrix. It disturbs me that Scorsese, a huge advocate for film preservation dosen't care more about the quality of his own pictures. C'mon Marty! You did it in Taxi Driver! A huge amount of sales would go up if he and Pillegi spoke on the thing. In addition, there is disc flipping involved? . On Casino, you didn't even have to flip. And, that DVD was more than 3 hours long! If this is the fault of Warner Bothers, then those idiots should respect the fact that this is one of the best films in film history!"
3,:shakes his head in disapproval at Warner Brothers,"Note to Warner Brothers: Your DVD production team should be fired! Great film- but I hate the Double Sided DVD! Also, where are the extras? You know- behind the scenes, deleted scenes, director's commentary? The extras you'd expect from a DVD. None of WB's DVD's have these. EG: The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and The Stanley Kubrick Collection (I would have loved to see the making of 2001: A Space Odyssey). Also, what's up with the cardboard DVD cases? Anyway, Goodfellas is good, but WB's DVD production team needs to be totally gutted."
2,A Rip Off!!!! Video quality SUCKS for a blu-ray!!!,"DON'T BUY THIS DISC: IT'S POINTLESS. WAIT FOR A RE-MASTERING.What utter crap!! What is it? Can't Warners be bothered to re-master one of the great films so it really looks as good as it COULD on blu-ray?? Stick with whatever copy you have and don't let them profit with this scam! I feel ripped off and I'm PISSED. I mean, I put the disc in and in the first shot of the movie I see ""ghosts"" coming off the red tail lights of their car cruising down the highway. Then when they stop to open the trunk and the tail lights are washed over those three greats Liotta, De Niro, and Pesci, the detail to the shot is almost non-existent. The rest of the movie doesn't look any better, like standard video, not high definition. At first I thought I had screwed up and put in a dvd of the movie by mistake, not a blu-ray! Hell, I've seen DVDS far far better looking than this disc.Shame shame shame on you Warners. You guys are the TRUE gangsters."
5,unflinching,if martin scorses made any more movies about gangsters we would have well more movies about gangsters done by martin scorses but seriously folks if this movie isnt great its well um well its great lets put it like that but dont forget mean streets or raging bull of course taxi driver and casino were a bit over rated but what the hell they were good
3,it was awesome,this is an all time great.it deserved its spot on AFI'S TOP 100 list.but ive heard some say its better than the GODFATHER.what are you stupid!!! the GODFATHER IS THE ULTIMATE OF ALL THE GANGSTER MOVIES!!!
4,"Good movie. The ""Fellas"" aren't so good.","When I saw this film, I didn't know what to expect. I guess the title is a bit of a joke, because these are violent and horrible men- nothing ""good"" about these ""fellas"". For those who don't know, it is a Mafia movie.A lot of scenes really made me a little sick. But since it is a true story, it must be seen. Like the nudity in ""Schindler's List"". You just have to grin and bear it in the name of authenticity.What I did like were the peformances. I am a big DeNiro fan (especially ""The Fan"" and ""Awakenings"") and he doesn't disappoint here at all. He is volatile and dangerous. The real scene stealer though is Joe Pesci from ""Home Alone"" and ""Vinny's Cousin"". He is unbelievable. I don't know if he got an Oscar at the Academy Awards for this, but he should have.I learned a lot about life in the Mafia from this film. More than from the ""Godfather"" even.Just be warned- it IS violent, so put the kids to sleep before you pop this one into the machine!"
5,Great Movie,"I am 20 years too late, but I love this movie! I have know idea what took me so long to buy it or watch it."
2,Goodfellows,"The language was terrible, I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have had the language been less vulgar."
5,Great movie,"Good action tire real life, just like if happen today. Action blood. Sex. And love. Car chase gun fights bar fights killings"
5,great movie!!,"1st of all if u havent seen this then get out of your shell.i watched a doc about henry hill not to long ago and the movie is about 95% true if not more..see this movie now, buy it now!"
1,NOT THE WHOLE MOVIE,"The movie stops not even half way through and returns to the main menu. When you go to the scene selections, it doesn't have all the scenes! Awful."
2,Disappointed,"When I received my movie, I found that half the movie was one side of the dvd and the other half on the other side. I just wish this info would've been on the description of the merchandise. Shame on you for misrepresenting your product. Will never buy used dvds again."
1,"Great film, but buy the special edition instead","I needed to watch this for a film class, so I just bought the cheapest version amazon had. In hindsight, I wish I'd spent a little more and gotten a decent DVD. This is a double-sided DVD, with the movie split in half over both sides. This means that if you're watching it in your living room, you'll have to get up and flip the disc over in the middle of the movie. In addition, it is not anamorphic widescreen, so on a widescreen tv it shows up as a little box in the center of the screen (though on a fullscreen it should be fine). Finally, it has no special features except for the trailers. If you plan on watching this film more than once, invest the extra bucks and get the newer edition."
3,A great 90-minute movie dragged out over two-and-a-half hours,"Following the progress of gangster Ray Liotta and his relationship with mentors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas is the kind of film you'll either think is a masterpiece or wonder what all the fuss was about. Performances are all outstanding, Scorsese's direction energetic and innovative, but somewhere around the halfway point you may wonder where it's going and come to the conclusion that great performances and grandstanding direction is all its about. There's no shortage of outstanding scenes but the film becomes increasingly repetitive as it underlines and escalates its variations on a theme until it feels like it's all style with nothing more underneath than a two-and-a-half hour episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Infamous.Good extras on the two-disc version, but it's hard to buy into all the hype for the film."
2,PLEASE BE WARNED NO TRUEHD/DTS HD MASTER 5.1 AUDIO!!!!,"to anyome who is thinking of buying this 2 Disc Blu-Ray edition of Martin Scorsese's Classic Masterpiece Goodfellas, please be warned of the following problem:-The Audio/Soundtrack has not been upgraded by WB the sound is still the same as the old DVD versions, this is very disapointing by the studio, i think they just forgot to upgrade the Audio.PLEASE BE WARNED NO HD AUDIO NO TRUEHD/DTS HD MASTER 5.1, THE SOUND IS TERRIBLE PLEASE TRUST ME AND READ THIS BEFORE YOU PURCHASE!!!.This is the only reason why i am giving this product 2 stars, the film and picture is 5 stars."
2,Great movie; Terrible DVD,"This great film has been adequately lauded elsewhere. The DVD, however, is terrible. It is unecessarily and inexplicably 2-sided, which is very irritating. The sound transfer is inconsistant, with dialogue getting lost in the background sound during several scenes. And if you care about extras, there are none to speak of on this DVD. A commentary from Scorsese would have been great, but there's nothing. I love the film, but if I were recommending it to a friend, I would actually tell them to see the video instead of the DVD."
2,seems like an illegal copy,No label on the CD. I have to exit and play the other side it over mid-way to watch the ending. Will not buy again. Very confusing. I will buy from another source.
1,Goodfellas,"This was the worst DVD I have bought since I've beencollectingDVD's. The sound was terrible and I had to flip the DVD in the middle of the movie. I didn't get any sound from the rear speakers throughout the movie... Don't get me wrong, it's a great movie and that's why I bought it, but the lack of surround sound and having to flip the DVD in the middle is why I've given it such a bad review. Please, bring these things up in other reviews... END"
1,Unlimited violence and obscenity,Deserves an X rating for all of the gratuitous violence. Little to offer to a Christian-based viewer who ascribes to humanist values.
3,MY GOD! ARE YOU PEOPLE NUTS?,"I truly cannot fathom the thought of this film being better than ""The Godfather"" or ""The Godfather Part 2"" I was flabbergasted when I read some of these reviews. OMG, ""Goodfellas"" is at best a well-crafted IMITATION of the number one movie of all time. And Scorsese's best picture? No freakin' way, haven't any of you people seen ""Raging Bull?"" That is his masterpiece! I admit ""Goodfellas"" is an enjoyable movie, but the only thing memorable about it is Joe Pesci's loud mouth. By the way, I think it's very sad that Scorsese cloned this movie, set it in Vegas, and called it ""Casino."" What a pile of crap that one was! ""RAGING BULL"" IS A MASTERPIECE, YOU MUST OWN IT! Just rent this one, it's good, but no way would I buy it. By the way, to all you ""THUG LIFE GANGSTA wanna-be's, if you think this movie is ""HARD,"" check out ""American Me"" with Edward James Olmos, that movie makes ""Goodfellas"" look like ""Barney."""
4,a step up from DVD but no Chronicles Of Riddick,a good movie but not a standout title on HD-DVD. Upgrade for enthusiasts of the film only
3,"""You're a funny guy""","Good fellas has some funny moments, like the ""you're a funny guy"" scene, but this movie is too much like a real life story to be good entertainment. Plus these wiseguys are so empty as people, I get tired of watching them. Ultimately, the characters in this movie are not that interesting and I see no redeeming value in any of them, and my main feeling is that at best these gangsters are social parasites.So, I guess the main value of this movie is a somewhat entertaining semi-documentary, but this only is worth 3 stars in my book."
2,JUST AIN'T BETTER THAN THE GODFATHER!,"I LIKED IT AND ALL BUT THIS MOVIE IS JUST LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE MAFIA MOVIES KILLINGS,DRUGS,MONEY.NOTHING COULD TOP THE GODFATHER BECAUSE IT'S A ORIGINAL MAFIA MOVIE.THE GODFATHER SHOWS MORE OF A MAFIA LIFE."
5,Loved the music soundtrack.,"Great movie,but I loved the music of 'Layla'(Derek and the Dominos also a.k.a, Eric Clapton[pink Cadillac scene]). First 2 minutes is hard rock music,later followed by 2 minutes of piano,in this movie they edit 'Layla' to only the piano part,and another good song is 'What is life' by (George Harrison),two great and awesome songs!"
3,Movie good format not so much,"This is probably my husbands favorite move of all time so I was excited to get it for him for christmas. However the format on it is not the most user friendly the scene menu is not organized at all, and you have to flip the disk over halfway through the movie in order to finish it, but again it doesnt line up exactly where it is supposed to with the change over. Overall I am disappointed with the disk and will most likely end up buying him a second copy of this movie."
4,Forget about it!!!,"Great movie. love the beginning and middle section, could use a better ending. DVD I purchased works great."
1,Ordered this HD-DVD..NOT FORMATTED PROPERLY!,I ordered this HD-DVD but it would not work in my HD Sony Entertainment System! I contacted the company and told them and they advised my to send it back and they would send my a regular DVD. I explained that I did have an HD system but it must not have been formatted correctly. I decided not to send it back because it would cost me over $5.00 in postage and I only paid $4.50 for the DVD. I did not want to invest more than I paid for the DVD. I purchased the DVD elsewhere. I would not purchase from this vendor again!
5,Classic lines from a Scorcese Masterpiece,"I really can't put into words how I feel about this film. A Scorcese masterpiece (for which they robbed him of Oscar), it juxtaposes, (the same way the Sopranos did later on), the real life family struggles mobsters deal with.......with their ""jobs"". Add to that the masterfully written dialogue, which incidentally has provided years and years of fodder for my family, and you have a film of monumental proportions---""Henry....you gotta go back to Karen.....you're not gonna get a divorce...we're not animale""....Genius! Genius!"
2,HD DVD Is So-So,"This film is one of my all time favorites BUT the HD DVD transfer is awful,the picture is dark and grainy with little or no 3D pop.I was also expecting more extras with the HD DVD version but I was sadly mistaken,if you like extras then get the two disc ""Special Edition""."
3,Don't get THIS edition!,"The movie itself deserves a 5 star rating, but I gave it only 3 stars for the DVD edition. If you really want to enjoy the movie, then buy the 2-disc special edition, it's only like $5 more anyway, and you get the whole movie on just one disc, this single disc edition I don't like because you have to flip the disc over a little past halfway through the movie... and who the hell wants to watch a movie where they have to get up to turn the disc over??? I mean, isn't that why people upgraded from VHS and cassette tapes to DVDs and CDs!?"
4,Just some additional Disc info,"Indeed this is one of the greats. However everyone buying the disc should know that it is dual sided thus forcing a flip. Not a huge drawback, but I like to know what I am getting into when I buy."
1,BUYER BEWARE !!!!!!! - NOT DUAL LAYER !!!!,"BUYER BEWARE - BUYER BEWARE - BUYER BEWARE -BUYER BEWARE - BUYER BEWARE - BUYER BEWAREI was VERY VERY disappointed when I played the movie about half way through and it went to a blank screen. A quick look at the disk and the case revealed (by the UPC Code) I was sold a format that is NOT DUAL LAYER and the disc MUST BE TURNED OVER to see the second halfIn this Day and AGE, this is NOW OLD- OLD Technology and not sold anymore,,,I feel I have been DUPPED as this is not highlighted by the SellerIF I COULD, I would rate it a ZERO...I wrote the Seller and received NO response. I am NOT sure how this Seller got/gets such a high rating on this specifically on this product UNLESS they have a mix of older and newer discs. After my issue, I read further and see OTHERS have gotten this old format as well"
5,The world of mob guys. A+,"Violent and language but most excellent characters and story of mob guys. Like the movie ""Casino"" or ""The Godfather"" series in its raw view. Not a ""date or wife"" movie but very entertaining. Love good movie making, then see this one."
4,Goodfellas,"A good story to follow, a bit of blood'n'guts action/ mobster madness, great period costumes, Great Actors, a few unforgettable lines - A Classic Movie"
5,Goodfellas | Blu-ray digibook,"Take a look at this in-depth review of Goodfellas Blu-ray Digibook on Youtubehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc-DTqeXvwAYoutube channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/Snollygoster123This digibook has a glossy print on the cover and thick glossy pages, It is a must have for movie collectors"
5,Best Film Action Drama,"Just watched this on AMC the other day on a small old 27"" and after maybe 20 times, STILL I rate this film as phenomenal in script, acting, directing, set design, etc. Typically one can find inconsistencies and other issues after many viewings, but this one stands the test of time. Was surprised I watched in entirety without a single negative comment and that is a rare moment in my film viewing history. True roller coaster ride, wide-eyed captivating drama based on a true story. Highly recommend and if O'Henry sobers up, anticipate a franchise extension with Part Deux and his painting career, divorce, kids, and life on the left coast!"
5,Scorcese's Best,"Though I love Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, I must say Goodfellas is my favorite Scorcese movie. The other two movies were great dramatic pieces, but this movie is just to damn cool. First of all the pacing is beautiful. This thing moves like gangbusters for the whole movie. The second is the editing. The quick cuts add a ton to the movie. Next is my all time favorite actor Robert De Niro. Though in a smaller part than in other Scorcese pictures, he still puts in a good performance. Joe Pesci is also great as Tommy DeVito rightfully won the best supporting actor award. So overall, being the Scorcese afficiando that I am, Goodfellas stands out as the best of Scorceses career. Raging Bull had better acting, Taxi Driver was more disturbing but the clicher has to be the ""how am I funny"" scene which is classic.So if you like the Sopranos or any other gangster movie see Goodfellas."
3,Great movie,Classic great gangster movie. It do show when a movie was not filmed in HD. But back in it's day no one used HD. The reason for the 3 stars is why make a Blue Ray for a movie not filmed in HD.
1,Good Fellas Movie purchased on Amazon,We were not pleased with the purchase of the movie- Words appeared at bottom ofscreen all during movie (Closed captioning?) It was very distracting and we werenot pleased.Thank youTrish
1,"F this, F that.","Goodfellas could've been a great Scorsese film but after 30 minutes I couldn't stand all the swearing. The violence I can handle but every other word these mobsters say is the F word. Ok I understand that's how these guys talk but jeez don't they know any other words, apparently not! I prefer Raging Bull or The Aviator instead."
3,One of the greatest movies -ruined by Flipping,"Imagine a movie where you get so caught up that you want for it never to end. Goodfellas is that movie, I my opinion it's better than The Godfather, because this injects a slightly more humorous side to the tale of Harry Hill and his Mafia pals.However just as you think the dvd is running well, the screen goes blank and you have to flip the disc over. Surely Warners coud release a special edition of this movie and keep it all on one side. I've awarded this movie 3 stars because the movie is still powerful it's just annoying that Warners looked at the cheap opinion of manufactuer on this wonderful movie."
1,Horrible DVD,I will not review the film because many people gave it already five stars and I agree on this.But I review the DVD. On this particular version the film is split in half. So at one point you'll have to flip around the DVD to continue.The person who was responsable for this decision hopefully got fired for this .It's disrespectful to the director/crew and the audience.This version shouldn't be on the market anymore.
1,Really bad DVD sound quality,"Awesome film BUT the DVD is pretty much unwatchable, you cannot hear the dialog track over the background sound. I would return it - but I already opened it."
3,Goodfellas=good flick,"I will admit that I typically don't like mob movies, but this is one of the better ones I've seen. It presents a more lighthearted (for a mob movie) view into organized crime. De Niro is solid and Pesci plays his usual psycho violent mobster. But the real star is Liotta with his creepy yet charming smile, penetrating eyes, and goofy laugh. While the story is mostly entertaining, it is almost 2.5 hours long and drags in spots. The HD DVD transfer is quite good-among the best so far. While I won't be buying it, it is worth a rental from Netflix."
3,Good for its time,Goodfellows got alot of attention when it came out. I think Miller's Crossing and Casino were alot better.
3,Godfather Try Hard,"Sorry for those of you who like it, I personally hated it. Joe P was so annoying in this and Ray does not look like a gangster at all. The only actor I can really say satisfies his role is Robert. The movie was too long it ran out of steam about 45 minutes into it."
2,Yet another DVD Double Dip,"Why do the studio's keep churning out movies without any real difference?I mean GoodFellas was known at the time of release to have been cut down to get an R rating. But here in the rerelease we get yet the same version of the flick as before with a better picture and not the different soundtrack. Sounds alot like Scarface to me.The audio com's as cool as they are, are not that worthy of repeat listening.SO what else does this ""new"" double DVD have? Deleated scenes? No. Uncut version of the film? No. Retarded extras that you would only view once with nothing added to the film? Yup.Waste your money if you want, I smell a 20 year Special Edition waiting in the wings.The only reason to release this now is that Henry Hill is over the hill and may not be around to see that edition.Thanks."
1,I Want To Start A Petition......,"Firstly to acknowledge this film as the best film in motion picture history and secondly and perhaps more importantly to give this film the credit it deserves with a real DVD! I don't care what anybody says DVD's should not have to be turned over and have to have some special features. I mean this film is amazing, the master of the gangster film genre why can't we see a DVD that celebrates this until that time stick to the VHS its all we have, ..."
5,Goodfellas stands tall above mobster movies.,"Being a true story makes this movie that extra bit magnificent. The movie presents to you the lifestyle of the mafia in italy in a powerful dramatic style of film shown through the eyes of a person who was stealing for the mafia as a child and grew up in their atmosphere shows right from the beginning how things worked whilst living with the mob, knowing everyone, having a lot of extra relations, the money and the work they go through in order to get it.As the movie progresses the main character finds things more and more difficult and ends up running for his own life from those who were especially close to him throughout his life.The movie is presented in the best posiible way and is also quite edjucational i give it the five stars and i strongly suggest that you watch it aswell."
5,A True Modern Classic!,"A truly great movie takes more than one viewing to fully appreciate all of the subtle qualities that make it brilliant. Goodfellas is one of these movies. This film can be just as frightening and disturbing as the american mafia it depicts...and true mob-movie fans wouldn't want it any other way. I have now seen this movie over 100 times and each time, I am still awed by the brilliant storytelling of Scorsese, and the remarkable acting of its stars, namely Deniro and Pesci. Wether or not you are a fan of the Mob genre, this is an absolutely essential title."
1,Warning - DVD is double sided!,"There is simply no excuse for having to flip over a DVD half way through to watch a movie. Plenty of longer movies than Goodfellas have been able to fit on ONE SIDE of a DVD.Without a doubt, this is an excellent movie (as the other reviews concerning the movie itself make evident), which is why I bought the DVD. If I had known in advance that I was required to flip it over half way through the movie, I never would have bought it in DVD format."
2,"Fantastic movie, crummy DVD","This particular item is, unfortunately, one of those early DVDs that you have to flip over halfway through the movie, which is the pits. I thought I did my research thoroughly enough to avoid that, because I was certainly aware that this annoying product was out there, and I really wanted to avoid it.But no such luck. My advice--look very carefully before you buy to make sure you get a good quality MODERN DVD. It turned viewing one of my favorite movies into an irritating exercise."
1,Need to flip over the DVD,"The 2 reasons I buy my favorite movies on DVD are that they don't wear out and that long movies don't need to be interupted by putting in the other video tape. Well, on Goodfellas one half the movie is on each side! What a waste of DVD technology! They need to correct this and rerelease. That I would of course rate 5/5."
4,$5.49 GREAT DEAL,"I'm all about Blu-ray. Stopped buying DVDs a long time ago. This was a great deal for $5.49 & FREE SHIPPING! Wouldn't buy this at the current $11.49 price considering the image isn't great for a Blu-ray. Still better than DVD though. Most old movies are transferred poorly and this is one of them. However, it's still a great film, and honestly, some movies don't need to be perfect. The age gives them character."
1,"This description is leaving out a very important part, don't purchase!","This DVD version was made many, many years ago and is set in matted version, so the size of the screen is about half of your tv size. Also, it's so old that you have to flip the DVD over to see the second half of the movie. It is very grainy, awful. They should really say this in the description. Splurge and buy the 20th anniversary or Blu-ray version."
4,Better than the DVD Version!,This Blu-ray looks and sounds incredible on a HDTV. I also have the DVD version but will no longer watch it when I have this beautiful replication around.
5,The Italian mafia at its best!,All I can say about this movie is that it has to be the best Italian Mafia movie ever!! Definitly my favorite. Out of 10 I give it a 10
4,very happy,"We were very happy with this purchase. It came in the mail fast, and we would shop here again. Thanks!"
5,"""...it draws you in, then spits you out""","Wow! First off, this movie has a great cast. Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta work excellent together. With their combined acting skills and the intense storyline, this movie is bound to reel you in. I don't remember how many nights my friends and I watched it, but I know that it will never be enough. Funny, intense, and sad; it draws you in, then spits you out. You'll have mixed feelings about this movie, and won't want to return it."
2,goodfellas,"It is a great movie, but it stops in the middle and keeps going to a menu, obviously defective . But anyone who has seen the movie , knows the story is great"
2,It's a flipper,"DVD Edition: A great film severely marred by the fact that you have to flip the disc. Technically, the transfer is pretty good suffering from only a few artefacts and banding. Good players will make up for this.In the final analysis though, I believe consumers should not have to stand for flippers. Given the lack of additional material to make up for this, you shouldn't buy this disc until they reproduce it on a dual layer disc."
4,It's not the realease form.,The reason i gave this film 4 out of 5 stars was not do to the way it was realeased you know flip it over for second half of movie. it was because i found it a little hard to follow. I'm only 13 and i was when i saw it. I realized it's just a crime drama about Henry Hill's life. But i just didn't care for it as much as Scorsese's other films like The Departed or Casino both of those films i give 5 stars. thats all i have to say
3,"Not bad...if you like blood, and gore","OK, like anyone else I enjoy a good ganster movie...but why ALL the gore, blood and violence? I think ""martin"" over did it just a bit. It was a little too much for my to stomache. But all-in- all it was a well done film with GREAT DIALOGE."
1,"horribile dvd, great film","This is one of the best film's of the 90's and next to the godfather, the best mafia film ever. The dvd however leaves a lot be desired. number one you have to turn it over halfway thourgh the movie. they couldn't put the whole movie on one side this is riddiclious, i can atleast watch the vhs without intruption of turning it over. The other problem is there are no features at all and that is pittiful for such a great film. Warner brother's please put this out in 2 disc special edtion, untill then I will stick to my vhs and recomend you do to."
5,"""All I ever wanted to do was be a gangster...""","with those simple words, we are plunged into the dark underbelly of crime from the 50's to the 70's. the true life story of Henry Hill moves us in ways that remind us of Scarface and The Godfather. a fantastic cast, and a great story (a true one, keep in mind) make a stellar movie. a must see. words alone cannot convey the power of this movie. see it!"
4,Goodfellas with Great Roles,"Martine Scorcese is absolutely brilliant! Robert De Niro plays Jimmy Conway, a guy who will never be ""made"" because he is part jewish. Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill who will also never be made because he is half jewish as well. And Joe Pesci plays Tommy DeVito, a full Italian who will some day be the boss in Liotta's well-narrated part. This film focuses the most on Liotta and this is the movie that no joke ""made"" all three of these talented actors. This is also from the maker of""Casino"", another great film by Scorcese. But, ""Goodfellas"" is the better of the two. Pesci roles in both films are very similar and he is funny and entertaining in both. ""Goodfellas"" is one of my favorites and I will recommened it to just about anyone who can understand it and like it as much as I did."
5,The Best Movie of the 90's.....Period.,"This is De Niro's master-performance and Scorcese's masterpiece. From top to bottom, the best movie I have ever seen. The best mob movie ever made (yes, better than the Godfather). Sheer genius at work, Pesci is amazing as Tommy, Liotta will never have a better role in his life, and Paul Sorvino is great as well. But, the real scene stealer here is De Niro as Jimmy Conway, a character that demands your attention and does not relinquish it until the movie's end. No other movie compares to this, this movie is perfection. If you do not own this on DVD then BUY IT NOW!"
2,Unwatchable DVD of a great movie,Get ready to ride the sound button on your remote. I don't know about the quality of the original sound mixing...that could be the culpret--but at the very least the sound mastering of this DVD in non-existant. It is impossible to enjoy this film in this format. Each scene requires you to reset the volume. It is completely unacceptable.
1,someone better bury this DVD in the weeds,"Excellent film - horrible, horrible DVD. Shameful really. But who cares, right? Throw 'em a bone and the money will roll right in. I wish Criterion would get a hold of this one. Nowhere to go but up."
2,A classic...Something wrong with the Blu-ray disc transfer.,"One of Martin Scorsese's best films. There is a flaw on the disc itself. There is a line running down the screen on chapter 27. The Robert DeNiro scene with Ray Liotta and Paul Sorvino. Same problem on two discs. This may be a transfer process issue. Great movie, bad BD copies."
5,Goodfellas,"When you have Joe Pesci and Robert Dinero in the same film, you got Hollywood magic. Love watching these two give and take between each other. Great great actors, both of them."
5,Goodfellas with top quality picture and sound.,"Theres not much to review here, Goodfellas is in my opinion anyways one of the best films ever directed and produced, the chemistry between Ray Liotta, Robert Dinero and Joe Pesci is amazing and they pull off an amazing storyline. I obviously would recommend this film to anybody whose into the Gangster action films and hasnt seen the movie. I love the fact its on Blu Ray now, The moment I saw it on the shelf i picked it up and bought it. the sound and picture quality is top notch and does wonders for this film regardless of its the graphics of the whole movie, the fight scenes that take place, the drug scenes or the shooting scenes all look great, crystal clear. I Highly recommened this movie and buying it on blu ray, you wont be dissapointed. Enjoy hope this helped."
3,Favorite mob movie.,"This is my favorite mob movie of all time. Sure, many will argue that the Godfather is superior, but Goodfellas is the film of my generation. Since I love this film so much I have chosen to wait, impatiently, until the special edition dvd is released. I've heard that Warner Bros. will be releasing it in September 2004. My friend has the original dvd, and I have to say that the transfer is sub par. The sound quality is lacking and the disc must be turned over halfway through the film. If the heresay is true, then September will be a glorious month."
3,"""GoodFellas"" is Just Good...Nothing More","I am not really a fan of the mob movies, but I have heard so much about 'GoodFellas' that I just had to rent it! Joe Pesci's character was ugly! He shot people for the fun of it and then laughed about it. Everyone is saying that 'GoodFellas' is the perfect crime story. It is just how mafia life is. If that is the way mafia life is...it is the first I have heard of it. The end was what got this movie the three stars that it got. (And I was in a generous mood, when I gave this rating.) If you are a fan of these kind of movies...you'll love it. If you are just going to watch it because everyone says it's good, you are making a mistake. The violence is extreme. The 'F' word is used in just about every other sentence. When it is all put together...IT MAKES YOU SICK TO YOUR STOMACH."
1,A brutal act of missunderstudment,"This movie is worthless, for one thing the violence scenes that portraits the maffia like some ordinary screw ups,is what I think,not correct.You dont shot some body in the foot just because his acting stupid.I think its a perfect sample of what happens if you try to copy and inhans,in this case the violant scenes,from other movies and try to do a box office hit out of it."
4,"Good, but I was expecting something more original","I finally got around to watching this ""classic"" and was honestly a little disappointed. The actors are great, and the setting and production is first-rate, but I felt the plot was a little too similar to tons of other gangster crime movies. I prefer crime movies that push the genre in new directions (Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Kill Bill"" are good examples). Still, worth seeing once."
1,"Good movie, B A D DVD.","Quality of the transfer is bad as is the fact this is a ""fliper"".No, not j.kerry a DVD that you have to turn over half way through the movie. There's no reason for either of these."
1,Goodfella,"# Actors: Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci# Directors: Martin Scorsese# Format: Dolby, NTSC# Region: All Regions# Number of discs: 1# Studio: Warner Brothers# DVD Release Date: December 15, 2009# Run Time: 146 minutesOrder this title on UMD format. The description is listed as ""ALL REGIONS"". I received the UMD and it is for a region 2 only."
2,Most over-rated movie of all time!,This movie for some reason always ends up on the best 100 list. Why? I have no idea. Every character comes across as being caricatures. Difficult to treat this movie seriously.
1,GoodFellas,"GoodFellas could have been a good movie. I think Robert DeNiro is the best actor of our time. But if they had left out that ""F"" word their would not have been any dialog at all.I do not think gansters used that word way back then anyway! I wonder how many of the actors in this movie would want their children to watch it.Thanks for listening!!!!"
1,Empty experience at the movies.,"This movie plays like an incredibly well made, overly long, TV re-enactment. It is based upon the imagination of a moron, filled with exageration, cliche, and caricature. Why anyone would waste their time with this is beyond me."
1,Disappointed,"After realizing this is my girlfriend's favorite move, I made this purchase because of it's great value figuring it would make a great gift for the holidays. Placed the order mid-December, tracked it to my city by December 19th, then by December 24th realized it was mis-shipped up to Federal Way, WA and never moved until January 8th when I realized the item was shipped back to the seller. Seller refunded money. I had to salvage a late expecting gift by buying local when realizing the seller told me he would refund my money.In a word, disappointed by the inconvenience caused by ordering the item thru Amazon.-E"
4,Goodfellas,Quality quite good except that halfway through the movie the viewer has to get up and flip the DVD to the other side.
5,Best gangster movie of all-time never looked better.,One day the kids from the neighborhood carried my mother's groceries all the way home. You know why? It was outta respect.
5,GoodFellas DVD,"Very good price, great communication and super fast delivery. I highly recommend the product and dealer."
2,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD","I am reviewing this specific version of the DVD. Although the movie is 5-stars, you should purchase one of the newer DVD versions, esp. the 2-disc set.Movie: Awesome!! I had rented this one so many times, I realized it was time I bought it. Unfortunately, this one was a gift from my wish list and the gifter bought a cheap version.DVD: A two-sided widescreen edition, you have to flip it half-way through the movie??? Old, old technology. Get a newer release!Case: Cheap. Flimsy. Cardboard."
1,"Incredible movie, but&#65533;","I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Yet the DVD doesn't do this classic justice. First off, the movie is listed as being enhanced for widescreen televisions. Unfortunately, this only applies to the menus, not the film itself. Another major problem is that the soundtrack of this film seems to be mixed in Dolby ProLogic since there's a lack of surround action. And the biggest problem with this disc: it's dual-sided, not dual-layered. In the middle of the film, the disc stops and you have to get up and flip it. Come on: this isn't laser disc.Memo to Warner Bros.: Remaster this epic anamorphically, in DTS digital surround, and make it a special edition, 2-disc set with the film on a dual-layered disc and extras on the second disc."
1,Brilliant Movie...Slipshod DVD,"Since I consider Martin Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"" the greatest gangster film ever made and one of the all time great motion pictures, it breaks my heart to give the DVD issue only one star (almost feel like Henry Hill ratting on his friends).What could the ""geniuses"" at Warner Home Video been thinking?The DVD is two sided, which means it has to be flipped in order to watch the 2nd half and there are NO special features to speak of except for a couple of trailers and a few production notes.For a movie like ""Goodefellas"" (a film that boasts absoutely brilliant acting, writing, directing, cinematography, and soundtrack) to get such slipshod DVD treatment is inexcusable.How about it Warners?A ""Special Edition"" re-issue including commentary by Scorcese and/or Nick Pileggi; interviews with the stars, deleted scenes, and maybe the ENTIRE movie on ONE side.If it's not in the stores by the end of the Summer, we may have to ask Tommy, Jimmy and Henry to pay you a visit!"
1,2 Sided DVD?,"First of all let me start off by saying that the 1 star is not for the movie itself. The single star is for the DVD version because the movie is on 2 sides! That's right! Just like a laser disk. When my friend told me it was on two sides I thought there was a widescreen and full screen version on each side, which is very common on older DVD's. But no, halfway through the movie you have to get up and flip the movie to finish watching it. It this a big deal? YES! It is a DVD, the form of media that was supposed to do away with such nonsense. Completely unacceptable! 1 star!"
3,Curious about the Mafia?,"""Good Fellas,"" I think, is the definitive movie about the Mafia in the U.S. It's beautifully done; the acting and direction superb. The settings and the mise-en-scene were brilliantly prepared. Unfortunately, the subject is so repellant that watching it is about as satisfying as watching a cat torture a bird to death."
5,Goodfellas - a classic gangster movie,Brilliant movie! Brilliant the first time I watched it and brilliant now that I own it! One of the best gangster movies ever and one of my Top 10 movies of all time. I definitely recommend it. And how many of the actors in this movie went on to star in The Sopranos!
2,He's done better,"I was disappointed by this one, which seems to be a recording of a radio broadcast, complete with annoying voice over. Also, I didn't care too much for the arrangements, overly orchestrated. A much, MUCH better recording is Milanes' ""Boleros Mexicanos"", which is basically just him and his guitar. I'd rate that one 5 stars!"
3,Depends on Your Purpose,"Interesting exploration of underground hip-hop production. A limited diversity of interviewees hampers its usefulness - I was incredibly disturbed when one interviewee said, unchallenged, that the use of live instruments was ""not real hip-hop."" Otherwise, an interesting, albeit short-sighted journey."
4,A Sobering Believable Drama.,"When a Married Couple (Two-Time Oscar-Winner:Meryl Streep & Liam Neeson) discover that thier teenage son (Edward Furlong), who may have murder or accidentely murder his girlfriend. When he runaway from the Law, years have Passed and they find him and now he has to go in Court to Prove that his Innocence or Guilty.Directed by Barbet Schroeder (Single White Female) made a Believable Drama. Strong Performances by Streep, Nesson and Furlong highlight this Flawed film. This was a Box Office Disappointment in Theaters but the film did well on Viedo. It`s not a Perfect film but it`s well made. Screenplay by Oscar-Winner:Ted Tally (The Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon) Grade:B+."
3,Before and After DVD,"It is always a pleasure to watch and listen to M. streep and L. Nesson; however, the movie is not as exciting as I'd hoped for. Overall, it is a watchable film. The anamorphic widescreen is sharp."
2,Is it a comedy?,"Well, I found myself shaking my head and chuckling a few times and the ridiculous dialogue. But wait, it's not a comedy! As one of the other viewers pointed out, the movie dialogue was so corny and so much like a movie that it reminded me of a skit from Saturday Night Live or something. The parents were both morons, in my opinion. It's very sad that such excellent actors had to play such stupid roles.I give it two stars for the beautiful scenery in the movie."
2,Not So Great,"While some of the acting was good (Liam Neeson and Meryl Streep, in particular), this movie itself is not worth seeing. I found it to be unrealistic, unconvincing, stupidly dramatic, corny, and most of all, the screenplay was just awful. Everything felt contrived to the point that I couldn't really get into the movie or feel for the characters. And the ending was very incomplete and disappointing. If you love Streep or Neeson, then you may want to see this--otherwise, unfortunately, I don't think it's worth your time."
2,Incredibly BORING!,"A family is torn apart by the accidental death caused by their 16-year-old son of his girl-friend. The father (Liam Neeson) continually interferes with the case for his son's benefit, while the mother Meryl Streep wants to play it down the middle. It just goes on and on and on."
4,Sandymount set - Pat King,"The CD itself was in excellent condition and it came through the mail very fast. Great speedy service. The case was cracked however, but the MP3's went on to my ipod, so no major concern there."
2,No inspiration to visit Oregon after this video,"I've never been to Oregon. I planned to go there after travelling in north California because I heard that Oregon has a very beautiful nature. But after watching this video there was no desire to go there. Maybe the state is really beautiful, I don't know, the video does not show it. There was not a single place shown in the film which provoked my nature-loving feelings. It is not a professional filming. Operator(s) mostly did not film places waiting (or coming early) for a nice sunlight, rather shooting nature during peak sun hours which created harsher shadows and very pale colours. The quality of image is mediocre at best, and it looks like this is not because of the quality of DVD, but because of the quality of equipment they used. This is a review of the DVD, not of Oregon state!"
2,mediocre at best...,"This film manages to show some of the natural wonders of the state of Oregon, but spends way too much camera time on trashy side-of-the-road ""attractions""...and the makers also had a thing for showing intersections in the middle of small towns and the traffic lights therein for some unknown reason, and boy does he have a thing for lava fields too - one or two were quite enough, thank you...not very professionally done at all...and the narration will drive you insane if you listen to it all the way through...my advice - don't. Want to see Oregon? Visit sometime...it's gorgeous, but don't waste money on this thing."
2,Horror Porn that fails on both counts--for Erin Brown/Misty Mundae completists only,"This film has no plot, character development, conflict, catharsis; no vampires, stranglers, menace, ... It has interminable badly shot amateur porn scenes. If Misty Mundae wasn't so delicious, it would have no value at all. I own this title simply to own it. The one time I have watched it will almost certainly be the last. I may trot it out one day to prove to some fan of esoterica how cooler than thou I am."
1,WTF,"This has got to be the worst movie ever, its barely even a movie. I could make a better movie using my cell phone. The picture quality is crap, it has no plot and the sex scenes are lame. On the bonus disk there is a lost scene, it should have never been found. Why did I waste my money on this? It says on the back cover ""Its the movie Misty doesn't want you to see"", well that makes two of us. I was going to re-sell this movie but instead I'm going to burn it. Misty needs to shave her minge."
1,You'll be sorry you did,"These Sweetleaf ""flavored"" products are only for people who want something really sweet with just the very barest whiff of some flavor (you probably won't even be able to tell which one it is). If you're looking for a product that's about half sweetness and half flavor, THIS ISN'T IT. I urge you to save your money and look for another solution."
1,"Sweet Leaf Root Beer Liquid Stevia - ICK, ICK, ICK!!!","YUCK! I've not had Stevia w/an an aftertaste before trying several of the ""Sweet Leaf"" brands....tasted more like Sweet-n-Low to me than Stevia."
3,Not bad but some aftertaste...,This tastes pretty good in sparkling water but I have not found any other uses for it. It has less aftertaste than the Vanilla Creme so that's a bonus.
1,Very Disappointed!,"Would love to tell you what it actually tasted like but, got chocolate flavor instead of the Root Beer I ordered!"
2,Is useless without the companion video.,"This book is designed to be used with a companion video. It lists a variety of vobabulary words but without information on how to sign those words. If you are looking to learn ASL, look somewhere else or get the video."
3,"pretty good, could be better","This co-sleeper gets the job done. It is easy to assemble, works for our 16-inch height platform bed (with mattress), and has wheels and a small footprint that makes it easy for us to move it from room to room. But it has a few deficiencies. The mattress is a joke. It's an accordion piece of cardboard or similar that you can't elevate on one end if the baby has acid reflux or is congested. In fact, it's so flimsy and hard (even with a wool puddle pad that I bought for the co-sleeper) that I decided to swap out the mattress for a changing pad, which is fine for a newborn, but may become too constricting and potentially dangerous when baby is large enough to roll over because there is a 1-inch gap between the pad and the sides of the crib. There is no place to install a mobile, and there are no manufacturer options for a mobile."
1,"good product, but bad ordering experience","We lost OVER a month's use (a long time considering weight/age limit) because of wrong item being shipped out to us TWICE! We returned the first wrong sleeper & then received another of the wrong model. Amazon took forever to finally return our money to us in the end, so we had to wait a while to order from another company to get the right product. Very disappointed that we had to deal with taking it to UPS to return, & that we lost so much time. Really felt we should have received a gift credit or something for our trouble.That said, the Euro Mini is great for a low platform bed - would have worked better if our bed didn't have the ""lip"" (Ikea Malm). Was still very nice to have her at eye level for the short time we used it.If you want this, shop somewhere else."
3,Looks good but annoying assembly system,"This co-sleeper might be practical once put together, but I really hated the assembly guide or system of it. I almost broke it out of frustration!!! My wife was much more patient and was able to figure it out.I would not recommend it as a travel friendly item, although I am sure it will work out fine once we have set up and ready go."
5,An excellent introduction to REXX for novice programmers.,After struggling to learn and use REXX I realized the on-line manual was not enough. After looking at several books and reading various reviews and comments I purchased Dr. Richardson's book.Now having used REXX very intensively for nearly 2 years I am very pleased with the ground work and coverage the text provided. The inclusion of many example programs helped enormously when learning and I will still occasionally go back and look at them.
3,"Really 5 stars for the CD, 0 stars for Amazon.","We love this disk when we heard it at a friends. It is a great recording and performance. We received the disk as a gift for Christmas, but upon opening the packing found that the disk had nothing recorded on it. We ordered a return/replacement which amazon did not charge us for. The new disk arrived a week later and it too had nothing recorder on the disk. Amazon will issue a credit to our account, but we still don't have the CD wanted. Come on let's have some quality assurance or at least compensation for their incompetence."
3,Just OK,"The set is ""just OK."" Not as heavy as I'd expected and I've also noticed (per another reviewer)some rust on the knives. Better to look at what you're buying in person first before ordering online (she said to herself)."
2,Lots of rust,I have had my set for 3 months now and there is alot of rust on the tines of the forks and on the knives. Great price but I regret my purchase.
5,Love them!,This is the best flatware I've ever owned. They sparkle and shine even after coming out of the dishwasher!
2,Nice set but dissapointed,"I purchased this set as a gift and both myself and the receiver were pleased with it. It came packaged very nicely and the caddy was nice, a little large for a typical drawer however. My only concern is that none of the pieces were marked as being 18/10 which is one of the main reasons I purchased this set. I have a Reed & Barton 18/10 set myself and every piece has that clearly marked on the back of it. There was nothing on the box either to indicate that it was in fact 18/10. So I don't know if this was a misrepresentation of the product or if all of their 18/10 is simply not marked(which I seriously doubt). This is the reason I only gave it 2 stars because I feel that they have the discription wrong on this one and I did not get the higher quality set I thought I was ordering."
2,Reed and Barton Cresendo II stainless flatware,"I sent this flatware back because it was pricey and not as heavy as I would have liked. Good for everyday, but I wasn't looking for everyday flatware."
4,This is Crescendo II,"I purchased R&B Crescendo flatware 25 years ago. This Crescendo is not identical. It is 18/0, not 18/8 stainless, is much lighter in weight, and slightly different in salad fork shape. It is the same pattern, a great price, and I use both for large family dinners. No one notices the variations."
5,"Reed & Barton Crescendo II 18/0 Stainless-Steel 65-Piece Flatware Set with Storage Caddy, Service for 12",Excellent quality flatware. Arrived quick and just as described. I was particularly happy to find this product as I have the same set that I purchased many years ago and I was attempting to match it. Very happy!!
3,alright product,"Overall, it is a nice looking bookcase. I use it for dvds and have noticed the shelves are bending. The frame is great, but I would recommend different shelving units. It looks nice and for the price is not bad."
5,Love this Artist,"Ever since I heard ""L'Amour Toujours"", I've been a huge Gigi D fan. I love his material, and this is no different. With that said, it's preatty much a love/hate thing . . . you either love it, or hate it, and I LOVE IT."
4,Bella Ballet Flat,"These shoes are too cute. I love the flat nose that makes them different than the regular ballet flat. I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered it a 1/2 size larger than my foot. The elastic isn't too tight, but I could still see snipping it a bit. I get tons of compliments on them and they are very comfortable. I've even folded the back down and worn them as a mule. . . another option."
3,"Casino Royale, Black Hawk Down, & Hellboy",Never watched Black Hawk Down. Gave it away as a gift. Hellboy too. Kept Casino Royale. Cost for this 3-pk bundle was worth it.
3,Region Codes,Casino Royale will not play on a UK playstaion.The other 2 titles do.I was not aware of region codes on Blu rays until now. A quick check on the web indicates about 30% of releases are region coded.Unfortunately there is no warning on the outer casing or on the description that the disc is region 1.Otherwise the bundle is a good mix of action genres...
2,Blue ray region codes,Casino Royale is region coded A will not play on UK PS3. No indication on the package or on website. Other two blu rays are region free and will play on UK PS3. Buyer beware of blu ray films. Games are region free but films are not... depending on the publisher! It appears from a google search that 70% of films are OK but that darned 30% will get you.
2,Examples are in VB 6.0 instead of VB.Net,"Althought this book provides some very useful subject matter, the sample code provided is written in Visual Basic 6.0 rather than the new Visual Basic .Net - a fact that was rather dissappointing given that this is a version 2002 book. Since converting complicated code like comm add ins from 6.0 to .Net is no easy endeavor, I'm finding the usefulness of this book pretty limited for my purposes. If Mr. Byrne will write the same book with .Net examples or if Microsoft and Mr. Byrne will release an updated companion CD with .Net examples, the book and its companion CD will be a lot more helpful."
1,Hate to say it... but TERRIBLE was right....,This is a tired old rehash of a previous book - and even uses the OLD Northwinds samples. You'll find more on Sue Mosher's site slipstick.com.Sorry - but Save your money....
3,Nice NY Giants pink tshirt,"I loved the color, material was a little thin that what i expected, but overall I am happy with my purchase."
1,Wrong ink,"This ink came up in a search for pixma ip3000, but it is not compatible. The ink itself could be fine for the printers it is compatible for."
3,Good movie,"I actually like this movie. It's not as bad as people say it is, and I've watched it a few times. Mostly of course because Madonna looks so damn good in it. I'm not too sure about Sean penn though, and I still don't understand what Madonna saw in him. It's not the best acting role for any of the two but if you want to relax in front of the tv with a movie you don't have to think so much about while watching, this is it."
3,It's sorta okay,"I admit when I first saw this movie, I was mesmorized by Madonna. The acting is over-the-top and the plot a little far-fetched, but the movie doesn't deserve the reputation it has. Madonna has done worse, see The Next Best Thing or Swept Away, if you doubt me.Madonna plays Gloria Tatlock, a missionary (!?!?!) in Shanghai in 1938. Sean Penn plays Glenn Waysy, a glow-in-the-dark tie salesman (?!?!?!) trying to leave China back for the United States. They get together trying to find lost opium.The plot is far-fetched like I said earlier, and there is nothing ""good"" about the film, but... it doesn't merit the disdain it has."
1,Disappointing because the stars ARE stars,"Madonna has proven time and again that she's a talented actress, from the sly fun of ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" to her phenomenal performance in ""Evita"", and of course Sean Penn's an Oscar winner. Although this is one of their earlier films - WHAT WERE THEY THINKING???? This movie isn't fun, just dumb, from the blase plot to the far-fetched premise of Madonna as a missionary. This talented couple is utterly wasted on this flick and the lousy script is more of a tragedy than the Penns' failed marriage. Ugh."
1,The Lousiest Gong in Town,"The ONLY reason this film is worth more than gum stuck to your shoe is because of the late George Harrison. Some great songs were written and used in this film...some bad ones too!Where else can you find the one time Beatle crooning in 1937 China. Great songs like 'The Hottest Gong in Town' and 'Zig Zag' were unfortunately placed in this awful use of poor talent. Although he re-recorded it the next year, 'Someplace Else' is another gem done for the film. It's too bad musical talent was wasted on one song called 'Shanghi Surprise'.A movie like this could kill your career. Sometimes I wish it had."
3,This is a decent film- not sure why it's so hated.,"As I sat down to watch this film, I was braced for the worst but instead found myself rather pleasantly surprised. Honestly, I'm not sure why this is considered such a terrible movie. My only real complaint is that none of the characters are particularly believable, but I'm not sure how seriously this film was ever meant to be taken. The plot, while a little weak at times, is interesting enough; the songs George Harrison wrote for the film are great; and I especially enjoyed Sean Penn's performance of Glendon Wasey. I loved the part at the end where he's making Gloria wave! I think Madonna was good too but I don't believe acting is her first talent and to be fair, she wasn't given as much to work with in this film as Sean was. All in all, it was a fairly enjoyable 93 minutes of my time."
2,Bad... but perversely enjoyable,"The story is rubbish, the acting is bad, however I did enjoy it in some perverse way! (One of those, its so bad its good films perhaps?)Know-one comes out of this film unscathed. Penn's character is completely annoying; his histrionics really grated on my nerves and Madonna's acting has never been worse (the crying scene has got to be seen to be believed).The scenery is beautiful though, and possibly the only other noteable thing this film has going for it, is that Madonna is absolutely stunning in it."
1,NO SURPRISE HERE..,"JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE SEEN YOUR LAST OF SUCKY MOVIES..ONE, LIKE THIS REARS ITS UGLY, BLEACH BLONDE HEAD..WHEN WILL SOME PEOPLE START READING SCRIPTS, BEFORE COMMITING TO DO A MOVIE..I HOPE SOMEONE GOT FIRED OVER THIS FIASCO..IT ACTUALLY MAKES MOVIES LIKE ""GRAFFITI BRIDGE"" LOOK LIKE ""ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE""....MADONNA, GO HOME!!!!!!!! GO TO SHANGHAI, GO ANYWHERE, BUT RUN FROM MOVIES LIKE THIS.., I ONLY GAVE THIS 1 STAR, BECAUSE THAT IS AS LOW AS ONE CAN GO..IN REALITY..ONE STAR IS ONE TOO MANY..SAVE YOUR MONEY, GO GET ""SPINAL TAP"" INSTEAD."
4,"A nice, rare biography","The biography of a little remembered General of the Civil War is a terrific read for those who are fans of the American Civil War. Nichols has put together an pleasant story that not only gives more color to a dashing general, but also allows the reader to escape into the period.This book is a quick read and perfect for a school project. It is also a good addition to any Civil War history collection."
4,Great teacher resource,"I found Chemistry Connections very interesting and informative. I am a high school science teacher and I already have a strong background in chemistry. The format presents infomation on each question at multiple levels of sophistication, from introductory information accessible without much knowledge of chemistry to in-depth information on specific molecular structures and interactions. This book would be a great resource for chemistry teachers. My only critisism is that the writing style could be a bit more engaging."
5,If you accept Guy Sajer as legitimate,"This book is stupendously gripping. I've served in the military, but I have never encountered such unspeakable ferocity, desperation, and naked will to live as I have in this book. The inefficient Wermacht supply system is readily apparent from the story. The sense of frail hope and crushing despair sets into your bones with each new Russian offensive, and escape seems impossible, or if possible, simply fleeting. Sacrifice, pain, death, and every destructive scene will float through your mind as you read this book, and you will know war, as well as is possible without taking part in it.If Guy Sajer is a fraud, well it's not a crime, but it should be. Then again, we may never really know. Make your decision after reading his book."
5,Forgotten Soldier,"Haunting. Three years ago I read a dog-eared, paperback copy of this that was loaned to me by a friend from England who'd read it a number of times. This book has absolutely nothing to do with politics and everything to do with how miserable and deadly life was for the average German ""grunt"" in WW2. Images and situations that are described stick with me. I want to re-read this book. I'm ordering 3 Hardcover copies today: one for me, one for my son in his 20s and one for my friend in England (as a ""Thank you"" gift). Hardcover because I intend to keep this book for a long time."
2,Captivating account. But is it true?,"This book is very involved and a joy for WW2 history buffs. Unfortunately, after conducting a little side research, I discovered a great deal of skepticism leveled at Guy Sajer and his account of his ""experiences"" on the Eastern Front during WW2. His critics provide specific instances of discontinuity, fabrications, or deliberate gray-areas detailed in The Forgotten Solder, and one must take this into account when wieghing it's authenticity. I found these accusations downright troubling and didn't rate the book quite as high as a result. If you can overcome the skepiticism associated with it and consider the book a ""partial"" fabrication, you'll probably enjoy the storyline none the less."
2,Unfortunately it's a novel,"If anybody cares to read into the fine print, then one can tell this Guy Sajer is totally fictitious.I don't think he actually fought in the Gossdeutschland Division of the Heer, one of the few units allowed to wear an armband on the right arm, NOT left as he described it. For reference, please read the mass of books by Helmut Spater on the GD, from its infancy as an infanterieregiment to its end as a panzerkorps"
5,First read this book 30 years ago,"and I still remember it. Along with just a handfull of books I've read over the years, this one stays in my mind. While time has diminished some of the details, Mr Sajer's experiences as a foot soldier in the German army during WW2 have stayed with me in a very vivid way. If you are looking to read a book that can give you honest insight into what it must really be like to be a soldier during wartime and in battle, this is really the only book you need to read. I've just ordered a copy of the reprinted edition as I long ago gave away my original copy. Don't hesitate, buy a copy for yourself."
5,Excellent,"This book is the best I've seen written about the experiences of a soldier in the German army during WWII. Often harrowing and always uncompromising, this book gives a first-hand account of a fighter in the elite Grossdeutchsland army unit on the Eastern front and the trials he went through. Sajer shows that valor can wear many uniforms as he describes his introduction to combat during the early days in the war with Russia to the inevitable retreat back to Germany and final surrender. No book shelf on World War II can be considered complete without this."
5,The Most Powerful Book (except the Bible) You Will Ever Read,"I first read this book in 1975 when I bought it second hand at a high school book sale. I have since served in the US Army as an officer, am Airborne and Air Assault trained. Nothing compared to Guy Sajer went through. I am ordering the book again to have a fresh copy because my present copy is so worn. I cherish this powerful and moving autobiography. It is simply the best book you will read other than the Bible. I can only wonder what happened to Guy Sajer. Is he still alive? I would surely like to know and if anyone does please email me."
5,I cried when I finished this book,"I grew up hating the Nazis. I never saw combat when I was in the army. But I have a desire to see life as it really is; and war is a reality. I know that life is a mishmosh of the delicious, the blah, the horrible, and the disgusting. Heck, I can't seem to say in a few words what I am trying to express about this book. I would not have wanted to leave this earth without having read this book. I think it should be required reading in high school so that when young everyone gets an idea of what war is really like. I don't believe a better book could be written about this subject than this one. He may have remembered some details incorrectly, but who cares. It isn't a happy book. I felt like I had been run through the mill every time I had read a few pages. But I felt like I learned more about what life is all about - more than I can enumerate. I cannot say more than that I feel this book is of inestimable value."
2,A Classic and still probably the best.,"This is the book to start your collection of German WWII personal experiences. Easily ranks with ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" and has passed the test of time. A MUST for any library."
2,The Forgotten Soldier - great historyfiction book,"It is an excellent book but its category is misplaced - it should be categorized as historyfiction.I am a Jew born in Poland and all my father's family were murdered by Germans, and 90% of my mother's family were murdered by Germans. I heard many stories about how German soldiers behaved in concentration camps, and about how German soldiers murdered all Polish villagers as punishment for partisants activities. I read histotian accounts how German soldiers killed civilian hostages, and how they murderd Polish writers and Polish university professors.Mr. Sajer wrote a great book - now I am waiting for his next creation - ""Saddam Hussein - his secret life as Mother Teresa."""
5,German story,"Very good account of what life was like as a soldier on the Eastern front. Ive read a lot of stories from wold war two this was as good as they get.A devastating experience,Sajer was lucky to survive. Couldnt understand why he didnt go back to his girl, or even to see if she survived. Bruce"
5,A monument to the horror of war,"The Forgotten Soldier is an incredibly powerful story that lays bare the inhumanity of war. It does not matter that this is the memoir of a German soldier, because politics are not important in this story. This is a story about the fear and terror of combat; the death and destruction wrought by both sides on the Russian front. Anyone who reads this book will never forget it. I read this book for the first time 25 years ago, and it changed forever the way I thought about war. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
5,Forgotten Soldier,"This was one of the earlier first hand accounts of soldiers life on the Eastern Front that I have read. It is also one of my favorites to this day.The Author spent time in various units in the German Army. Then how he went to the SS because he got leave to do it. It was a soldiers story. That I could relate to, being a soldier myself. I also found it interesting that his Father was French. the bond he shared with his fellow soldiers. How they all shared the piece of cake they had. Even though they hadn't eaten for days. I was impressed and everything made sense in a way I could relate to. I have read this book a couple of times and I find it, just as interesting every time."
5,Absolutely Incredible!,"Having just read this book I must share the opinion of the reviewer M.Ballard (below) ""the greatest literary work I have ever read"" as well. This book is far and away the greatest war story ever told. Disregard the opinions of those who question the absolute accuracy of facts- that is not what this book is about. It is the story of an average human being's quest for survival against terrific odds and the search for the meaning of life, love and friendship in the mind of a seventeen year old who is experiencing a horrific war from the front lines. Sajer's recount of his experiences is vivid, disturbing, and deeply thought provoking. Sure to make anyone who reads it value life and the many comforts that we enjoy today as the result of so many others' past sacrafices. Forgotten Soldier is surely one of those books never to be forgotten, by me or anyone else who reads it."
4,Great Read,"A very enlightening account of a soldier's experiences. Couldn't put it down, a real page turner. Would recommend to any historical buff. Have read many WWII books, but this one really impressed me!"
5,Bitter experiences,I read this book back in High school and found it most insightful. It is not the story of a young German in the German armed forces but of a young man from one of the occupied countires who chose to serve in the German army because his mother was German.It is an insighful look at the Gewrman army of the Russian front during WWII at the same time a bitter tale of misery from the Russian front and as a member of a defeated army. William Tecumseh Sherman said 'War is Hell' and the author most likely agrees.
5,"Describes soldiers as humans, not political zealots","One of the problems with military history is thereader tends to get one side of the story. Oftentimes, those who fought on opposing sides areviewed as sub-humans. Just like how the film""Das Boot"" showed German submariners as humans,Guy Sajer does the same with the German soldiersin ""The Forgotten Soldier.""When reading about the Russian Front, the readerexperiences the bitter cold and unbearable suffering.The reader feels sorry for what Guy Sajer and hiscomrades experienced. Another heartbreaking storyis the hungry German soldier hung for eatingabandoned food earmarked for the German officercorps.""The Forgotten Soldier"" brilliantly tells the storyof a Frenchman who fought with the Germans. Thisbook should be read by all those in the military,for it does a masterful job of detailing the humancosts soldiers must pay in combat"
3,Speculative,"I see Amazon has changed our sign in status so we have to use our real names. That is great, but somehow all the reviews I did in the past have become disassociated with my ""new"" persona, so I am going to repeat what I said under my old handle.In my earlier comments, I dismissed the book as possible fiction. I urge readers to make up their own minds, but also to look at the excellent historical articles at http://www.deutschesoldaten.com for viewpoints by historians Lou Brown, Edward Kennedy, and Douglas Nash, for their thoughts on the matter.Not a bible for anyone interested in Grossdeutschland or the German Army, but no doubting it is a riveting read."
3,"A good story, but...","This book wasn't exactly what I thought it was going to be--a detailed account of a soldier's participation in the battle of Stalingrad. So, maybe that was my fault. The book reads a lot like ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", and Sajer does a good job, IMO, of describing the daily life of a ""grunt"". His accounts square with others that I have read and consider authentic. But if you're looking for operational information about the Eastern front, I'd look elsewhere."
1,fiction fiction fiction,"soooo many things just don t add up,this book is as goofy as that ridiculous grandfathers tale sniper book where he fought in nearly every battle and campaign as a sniper.the are two of the worst books i ve read and they both have 5 star ratings? how is this?........"
4,German soldeir's perspective of eastern front,"German soldiers were merely men, many w/o the ideology of the Nazis or Hitler. Great book on a German soldier's perspective of enduring war"
4,German soldiers view of the Eastern Front in WWII,"A young man with French father and a German mother is drafted into the Wehrmacht. He serves (initially) as a transportation driver traveling to the Russian Front. Later he is assigned to a infantry combat unit. He experiences all the horrors of war. As the war moves into Germany he and some fellow soldiers escape to the Western Front and are captured. Although, experts have found several errors, the book is certainly worth reading."
5,Any other WW II autobiography pales by comparison,"This book literally places you in the front lines with a foot soldier. His whole story is up front and personal; something that was and is common to foot soldiers. I realize many are saying he has made it all up; however, I remember hearing first hand in the 1950s very similar stories being told by former German soldiers who were lucky enough to have survived the fighting on the Russion front. I will leave it to the experts as to whether Guy Sajer was there or what we are reading is a fictional composite. The absolute violence and depravity rings true to exactly what I was told by former eastern front veterans"
2,Big Band Machine,"Although the Medley from ""Tommy"" may seem a bit dated and commercialized (as some would put it), it is still a very well put together arrangement. I really enjoyed the trumpet solo (Danny Hayes).""Pieces Of Dreams"" is another favorite of mine. Even though void of any solo work, still a very relaxing and introspective peace with marvelous voicings.The condensed ""West Side Story"" Medley is not in the class of the original. Solo work is on the ""lazy"" side.""Ease On Down The Road"" sounds too commercial. And one of the sore points many have made of Rich's band taking on show pieces that's purpose was only to draw a newer (or broader)listening crowd for the band. Too contrived for my taste."
2,Can't get past the samples.,"I'm sorry. Maybe there's more to this album than what I hear on the online samples, but I'd be surprised. I've been a fan of Buddy Rich since I bought ""The New One"" on vinyl when it was first released. Buddy's drumming not withstanding, the charts on this, as near as I can tell, are insipid at best. Unison melody lines, heavy rock guitar licks and boomy bass peg this one as originating in the early 70's -- a collection of mediocre tracks that someone put together to cash in on the current interest in Buddy's music.If you're just getting started with Buddy's music, try listening to the samples from ""The New One,"" ""Mercy Mercy"", ""Wham"" or just about any other release and see what you think."
4,Good movie,"I know some people did not like this movie, but I loved it. The film had me hating some characters and loving others. Ice-T played his role well in this film. The scene that still gets me to this day is when he gets Pookie from that crack house. The other scene is when he is with the drug lord, and finds out HE is the man responsible for his mothers death. That scene was deep. The film has a good cast, Mario Van Peebles, Wesley Snipes, Bill Nunn, Allen Payne, Vanessa Williams, Micheal Michaels and some other folks. The film really hipped you to how bad the drug scene is in the inner city."
5,DVD Purchase,"Excellent! I received the shipment before I even expected it. The DVD was in perfect condition when it arrived, and I would not hesitate to use again."
4,ALOTTA FUN,Now I don't ignore the fact that at times this a serious and darkmovie with the junkie played by Chris Rock(believable and scary)and other mentions of crack babys.But this movie is entertainingthe whole way through.I loved Judd Nelson and Ice-T was great andWesley Snipes was a modern day Tony Montana.Comparisons to Scar-Face are made in reviews but they're really not that much alikethis is no 3 hour long epic about one man.It's about cops dedicatd to stoping the crack(cmb)gang and ridding the streets ofdrugs.It's fun to watch the shoot-outs between cmb and the mobalso the cop's pull some dirty moves on cmb as well.Good movieall around.Despite what people say this is not an anti-drug moviebut a basic action cop's and bad guys movie with the usual gung-ho cops and ruthless ammoral bad guy all played well by the actors.I couldn't get enough.
5,quick shipment,i order this product on 9/15/2011 and recieved it on 9/17/2011. dvd did not scratch love the special feature. will b ordering from GFMEDIA again
2,Pure Formula Actioner,"The story about a prominent, handsome drug dealer and a determined cop who's out to catch him in NYC's underworld. Some good performances, mainly by Snipes, but it's all fairly routine. Ambitious flick badly in need of more conviction and less shallowness."
2,A rip off of Scarface and the Godfather,This movie is a clear rip off of Scarface and The Godfather. In fact the story is essentially exactly the same as The Godfather with the Scarface coke empire thrown in. The only difference is that there is the cops view of the events that go down and of course the fact that all of the main characters save one are black. Despite the fact that this movie is a blatant rip off I did enjoy it mainly because of Wesley Snipes acting. Other than that its been done before and been done much better.
4,Best present i've purchased,I bought this for a Christmas present for my niece a while ago. Both her and her brother had a blast with this toy.
5,This is a 5 star classic,Rio Bravo is one of the rare all time classics that you can watch over and over again.
5,Wonderful Movie!,"This is a great western. If you like John Wayne you will love this movie. This has John Wayne, Rickie Nelson, and Dean Martin - a great combination. I have probably watched this about 15 - 25 times and I still like it."
5,Rio Bravo is superior to El Dorado,"Rio Bravo and El Dorado both star John Wayne and were produced by Howard Hawks. The story lines are very similar but Rio Bravo has a stronger supporting cast. Walter Brennan is excellent as ""Stumpy"" and Angie Dickinson is far more appealing as the female love interest. Ricky Nelson gave a credible performance considering this was one of his first movie roles. If you must choose between the two movies, this is the one you will enjoy the most."
1,Amazon sells defective product,I ordered two different copies of this collectors edition. Both times Amazon sent defective products. There were two of the same discs in the set and one disc was missing.
3,"Blu-ray out of print, defective","Just purchased this on Blu-ray from a merchant, as it's out of print. I should have considered why a classic like this would be out of print on Blu-ray--but I didn't. One reason is that the transfer is far from optimal, as mentioned by others. The other reason is that the pressing is defective....the picture/sound freezes, skips, jumps, etc at different points in the film. This was not the seller's fault, as I should have done my homework before making the purchase. Hopefully, Warner Brothers will revisit this title on Blu-ray in the future, from a better master and without the authoring defects."
5,Classic John Wayne,Basic morality story with an excellent cast of either big name stars or stars soon to be big name. Angie Dickinson plays her role to perfection although you can tell Ricky Nelson is in a stretch role.
5,Classic John Wayne Western,One of the Duke's best. There is nothing better than watching this classic on Blu-ray. Amazing how much detail you notice.
3,HD DVD,"This DVD is for HD player only. I did not read as far into it as I should have. Will resale as used, but I never viewed the DVD.My fault only. Ordered another one that I could view on my DVD player. I imagine that this DVD would be a lot better in HD than standard."
5,One of the Dukes' best,"Very entertaining. Great chemistry beween Wayne and Dickinson. Excellent supporting cast in Dean Martin and Walter Brennan. Ricky Nelson shines as ""Colorado""."
2,low quality transfer,"Out of all the hd dvds I have purchased so far this one is by far the lowest resolution quality. Don't know why but its only a touch above a regular dvd in quality.So I'll probably send it on back for a refund or replacment from amazon. I've purchased only about 8 hddvd's so far and have had good luck with all of them, except this one.The quality of the rest is awsome, unbeleavably good. So much detail to obsere for the first time, you find your self rewinding to watch seens over and over like when video first came out. Very exciting indeed I just hope that more titles become available. I would buy lots of classic movies from the past but there severely lagging on getting out those titles. Come on don't they like making money? Isn't that what this is all about. Helloooooooooo hddvd companies get it together your loosing money.other than that,(and the war of course) its all perfect.... peace"
4,The myth stinks like a pale copy of something better,"A mythic film that does not really deserve it. It is the simple situation of the good-for-nothing brother of an important rancher in Texas. This brother kills someone out of spite and drunkenness and he is put in goal. His rich rancher of a brother sends his troops to get him out. That's the story of the siege of the prison, and the city, and how they are all going to be killed, on the bad guys' side. The touch of romance is nothing but a minuscule touch in a sea of brush strokes. John Wayne and his fellow crooners Dean Martin and company are doing what they can on a rather bad simple story with no plot or nearly no plot. John Wayne walks extremely badly for a sheriff as if he had a double and inverted rotation of the vertebrae. A society has the heroes it deserves.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"
2,Pure Cowboy Slock!,"Old Wooden Wayne and twenty-something Angie Dickinson with the most uncomfortable hooey dialog ever written. It was just awful. And Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson as cowboys, come on! Just an awful film. See Wayne in any Maureen O'Hara film, a thousand times better."
5,new sheriff in town.,"If you've hurt the innocent, keep your back far from the doorsleep with one eye open, keep a loaded 44, manbetter watch that gun, mancause ol' John Wayne is quick when trouble's at the fore.None of your business where he's been, don't ask him what he's donejust run your ranch and punch your cows,and stay behind his gun, manor ol' John Wayne's gun hand will put you on the run.He came in like a restless wind, on a wagon trainhe's going to go like a July snow,following the sun, man, better watch his gun, manhe's going to be a lawman until the wild west is tame,---Johnny Cash."
5,Classic,"One of my favorite movies of all time in beautiful HD. BD though wasnt too great. No surround sound, but what can you expect from a movie made in late 50's."
3,"Delightful, nonsensical romp through the old West","The star of this movie is Dean Martin, the lovable drunk. Wayne seems almost a spectator at times, playing the father to the rag tag bunch. The movie makes little sense and at times seems so silly as to be satirical. yes, the story movies all over the place and is essentially an assortment of skits, some good, some not. All the same, it is loads of fun, and not your usual goof ball western. The rabid dialogue of Dickens is hilariously dumb and accentuates my point-grab a six pack and enjoy a Wayne Western that does not take it self too seriously."
4,Another Great John Wayne Flick,"John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, and Walter Brennan - what more can one ask in a western? Comedy, action, songs, and the inevitable good-over-evil make a great story. Throw in a young Angie Dickinson, and you get a great show."
5,"if you like the classic westerns, this is a must-see, must-own","I first saw this movie in the early 60s, when I was a young kid, and it stayed in my mind. It's that good. I recently saw it with my 11 year old son, and he just loved it; this boy normally won't watch westerns. It's that good.John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan all do a great job. Even Rick Nelson, not someone you'd expect to see in a western, does a solid job. Angie Dickinson is very likable. It all hangs together, and doesn't work too hard at it; just goes down nice and easy. (Ok, I mixed my metaphors, but you get the drift.)What can I say, I love this movie! If you like the classic ones, buy it, it's worth every penny."
2,Hawks Past His Prime,"RIO BRAVO is sad, in that it shows Howard Hawks long past his prime. Hawks had his golden period from TWENTIETH CENTURY through RED RIVER. His later films, including this poorly structured, tritely written and clumsily acted (especially in its degrading treatment of its Mexican characters) western, are cardboard cutouts compared to his earlier films. If it's John Wayne and Dean Martin you want at the top of their games, check out SONS OF KATIE ELDER, one of the best of all westerns. Of course, its director, Henry Hathaway, isn't looked on with favor by the auteurist clique, thus it isn't given its due. But watch RIO BRAVO and SONS OF KATIE ELDER back-to-back, and decide for yourself which film is the better."
2,Let's mosey on down to the saloon for a dry martini...,"Dean Martin? Ricky Nelson? Angie Dickinson? Must be some Vegas caper flick--but no, it's a Western! Well...John Wayne at his most self-righteous, a totally unconvincing supporting cast (although Walter Brennan makes an exemplary grizzled old sidekick, whoda thunkit)--this flick was a nail in the Western's coffin, not one of the great ones.One positive thing: this was remade as the way better ""El Dorado"" (try Robert Mitchum and James Caan instead of Dino & Ricky, for starters)."
2,Hardly A Classic,"RIO BRAVO has achieved cult status, mostly because of the auteur nonsense attached to anything Howard Hawks did -- as long as it dealt with professionals carrying out their duties! This film is shallow, lazy, and encumbered with a truly embarrassing performance from Angie dickinson -- admittedly, she was hamstrung by truly awful dialogue."
5,Great movie!,I highly recommend this for anyone! Itis also one of the greatest misic videos I have ever seen.
5,Simply works.,Not much to say other than it installed in minutes and is working fine. Packaging was great and the one place I found it locally wanted twice the price.
4,An Early Contender for Best CD of the Year,"Heard this in a record store a couple of weeks ago and bought it as soon as the U.S. version came out (at $23.00 the import version is a little pricey). An excellent debut from a very talented band: musically they come from the same school as Stereolab, but with more of a psychedelic sound -- imagine if, instead of Can and Serge Gainsbourg, the guys in Stereolab had spent a lot of time listening to ""Ummagumma"" by Pink Floyd, and maybe the first King Crimson album. Or imagine Lulu (""To Sir With Love"") fronting a very early version of Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Moody, atmospheric music with unexpected chord changes, unusual melodies, and great lyrics. Highly recommended."
2,Conventional Ambient Electronica,"Birmingham's Broadcast play at the dark end of the electronica scale, the place where Portishead and Tricky meet soundtrack pioneers. On The Noise Made by People, their 2nd official release (there's also an EP collection), they're most successful with concrete sound collages. ""Minus One"" sounds like Bernard Herrmann scoring Hitchcock; ""Until Then"" is This Mortal Coil scored for a Hammer Horror flick; ""City in Progress"" is a Stereolab waltz; ""Dead the Long Year"" an ace Portishead rip. More often though, their conventional ambient electronica evaporates as you listen, partially due to Trish Keenan's lackadaisical vocals, or the unimaginative soundscapes of her fellow bandmates, or both."
2,A lot of stylistic posing without much musical backbone,"2 1/2Broadcast work with what they are given fairly well in this overpraised debut attempting to emulate a retro psychedelic sound, but the unimpressive songwriting leaves much to merely a weak, derivative atmosphere. While touches of electronic undercurrents help punctuate this moody pop in appreciative ways, it hardly seems enough to justify the noise made for these people, let alone be quality-compared with Stereolab. At least they provided elegant background music, Broadcast merely sound self-consciously elegant."
3,If Stereolab wrote songs for Saint Etienne...,"The title sounds insultingly simplistic, and usually it's not that easy to pigeonhole music by use of cute comparisons, but truly after listening to the music of Broadcast, I can say that this is an entirely accurate representation of their sound.Singer Trish Keenan's voice has a pitch and color remarkably like Saint Etienne's Sarah Cracknell, and the instrumentation is similar to that band's as well. But the distant, sing-songy melodies and rhythms are 100% Stereolab, and Keenan's vocal delivery is such a spot-on copy of Laetitia Sadier's that it's frequently distracting. I kept asking myself, ""Is Stereolab going to sue this band for stealing its style?""Which isn't to say that this is bad music. It's not. But it is very, very derivative. Unfortunately there are no song samples on this page for you to listen to (at least as of this writing). If you're curious, you can seek them out on another music site and decide for yourself."
4,Great Discovery,"My status as Stereolab fan led to me buying this record, and I was not at all disapointed. The music is flowing and psychadelic and the singing is haunting and beautiful. I highly reccommend it for fans of Stereolab and/or 60's psychadelia."
5,Broadcast - The Noise Made By People,"The Noise Made By People, Broadcast's first proper album comes on like gangbusters, smoothing out the rough edges of Work and Non Work while still retaining the skewed melodies and instrumentation. The songs verge a little more on the melancholy, from the slow, meditative ""Unchanging Window"" to the siren call of ""You Can Fall."" There's also the extraordinary ""Come On Let's Go,"" which manages to be both poppy and experimental. ""Papercuts"" is similarly catchy -- it's a tune that'll be stuck in your head like a malignant tumor. Again, the lyrics rise above the clichés and triteness that plague pop music. A wonderful album."
4,A Very enjoyable recording,"I am certainly by no means a Baroque purist. I very much am a lover of Bach being an organist, but authentic baroque doesn't nessicerily mean an enjoyable listening experience. I love the fact that this recording is in English. It would be nice to have a lot more things recorded in English. I also appreciate the fact that this particular interpretation doesn't follow the typical authentic baroque practice of doing everything half a step flat. Overall, I am glad I own this CD. If someone from sony is listening, please release more great operas and choral works in English. Thank you"
3,"It's not bad. But,,,","The work by Bernstein is NOT BAD. The interpretaion in English version and an explanation by the Conductor himself in 16 minutes, are rare account. And it is useful to a person who is not familiar to the music for understanding. It is also for us who had refering to the text with one hand during the listening. But They are extra entertainment after we knew real performance.The vocal soloists takes a good job, certainly. Especially David Lioyd, as Evangelist, gave a good impression to me by his tense voice. But, the disk is not one of the best performances as a whole. If you don't have any other disk of St.Matthew Passion, you had better choose other account , for example, by Richter, Gardiner, Klemperer, Mengelberg,,, It's better choice."
4,Vintage Zoot,Beautiful! Like having your back rubbed. The combination of Jimmy Rowles and Zoot is magic. The downside on this CD is that it's only 44 minutes long.
4,A Book of Noises,"I don't know how the un-Jewish concept of a spider family became the mechanism for a series of books about Jewish holidays but my kids and their friends love them.In these books Sammy observes the human family and asks his mother what they are doing. The mother always seems to have the answer even if it doesn't concern spiders (they just spin webs). This time Sammy is watching the family getting ready for a Purim celebration. Sammy is full of questions and tends to ask them very loudly. At one point Sammy even needs to be rescued by his mother.This is a book of noises but they are not your typical children's book noises. There is more about this holiday in the book than in the Tu B'Shevat volume but only the superficial symbols. There is a short version of the story of Purim included at the end of the book but it is very basic and simple. Still, my children (six and under) did find the book entertaining."
5,MOTHER!,"I very much enjoyed reading this story to the kids. Sammy keeps yelling out ""MOTHER!"" It made the story fun to read. And it builds up excitement for the holiday."
3,Not at that price I won't!,"For this price, you can do better! For the same amount of money, a cheap beige-box PC with 200GB+ would offer more configurability and storage. And yes, that includes a legal non-standard operating system. If all of that is too much work, then this may be the next best option. But don't be fooled; per gigabyte, this isn't a great price."
1,Rudolf Steiner rhetoric,"Original lectures by rudolf Steiner including instructions for teachers. I would have liked to see written alongside this, a modern ake on Steiner with justifications for some firmly held ideas. Reading steiners original works Gives me the impression of a man in his time, but without a reasoned argument for continuing to follow his precepts today I believe that followers of Steiner lose a potential new audience."
1,Poor Book,"I don't like this book at all and I am very surprised that no one has really expressed their feelings. I felt kind of coerced into reading it because I was persuaded by the author But I didn't like the plot or the characters. It was all so farfetched and ridiculous. Every page was a chore to read and I found my self skipping pages until the end. The whole ""I was mistakenly taken to a whore house"" is so overdone and to the author, I hope tha with the next book you can create magic, but this one really didn't."
1,The Worst Book I Have Ever Read,"I found this book to be the most ridiculous book I have ever read. From the beginning I was grimacing ever turn of the page. The heroine was a week twit and her love interest was a so uncharismmatic. I truly hated this book and I hated Kianna; and that name, Every time I read her name I wanted to scream. It is like the author is trying to hard and the only thing that results is a dumb and cheesy novel . Try reading Judith McNaught; she is great."
4,Awsome Sound,"If you like the type of techno in your car that pounds a lot of bass, then this is the CD to get. Melody and treble arent all that great. But the bass will pound the speakers.!"
3,Good read,"This book was quite the entertaining read. Jaylin is a serious trip! The man just oozed confidence for days, and he really had all of his woman in check at all times. Oftentimes I thought to myself can women really conform to a man this way, and I guess the answer to that question is yes when he puts it on you like Jaylin did. This book had sex, sex, and more sex, any and everywhere with any and everyone. Also there was lots of drama with Jaylin's women, almost too much drama, but it kept me reading. I would have rated this higher, but it was a lot of the same content over and over so it got a bit redundant after a while. I am curios though to see what will happen next so I will continue on with the series."
1,Glad I didn'T buy this one,"This is the third novel I,ve read by Ms. Hampton.My Best Friends Man was a good read,and so was How can I be down, but this is some mess she put to paper.I know its all fiction but please don't tell me there are women out there that would sleep with a man knowing he had two others on the side.The character Jaylin is just too hard to belive in. I would hope that Black women of the world had more respect for themslves and Please Please don't buy this trash. Hope you do a better job next time Ms.Hampton So Sorry ISee that some people do like this kind of ?????"
5,A Must Read,"If you love a juicy, realistic, well written story then you definitely need to read this story. Brenda Hampton is so talented and you will be amazed at her storytelling ability. I felt like I was at the movies. She has a way of drawing you into the story and you dont want to leave. I cant even hear people around me talking to me while I am reading her novels. Read all of her novels, you wont be disappointed. My Way or No Way, My Best Friends Man, and How Can I be down."
1,refund!!!!! rewrite,"SO DISAPPOINTED, I READ THIS SAME BOOK B4, SAME STORY LINE DIFFERENT COVER FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT LOVE BRENDA HAMPTON SAVE YOUR MONEY, EVIDENTLY SHE'S TRYING SWINDLE READERS INTO BUYING THE SAME BOOK SHE WRITTEN YEARS AGO...I WISH I CLD GET A REFUND, NOW I HAVE TWO OF THE SAM BOOKS JUST DIFFERENT COVERS, JAYLIN IS SO PLAYED OUT!!!COME ON AUTHORS WHAT HAPPEN REFRESHING STORIES, DIFF CHRACTERS...SO UPSETTING TO BUY A BOOK THAT YOU HAVE READ YEARS AGO...WHATS SO FUNNY IS PART 2 PLZ SAME BOOKS THIS IS A WARNING SAVE YOUR MONEY IF YOU HAVE READ BRENDA HAMPTONS ORIGNALS....."
4,If he don't want you..then let him go!!,"I really enjoyed this story and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the books in this series.It had just enough drama to keep me turning the pages,yet I couldnt get over the fact how naive these women were when it came to Jaylin.You could have sworn he was the last man on earth...I mean really???.But then again,A man is going to treat you the way you allow him too.These women just made me sick.And the men were no better.I cant wait to see how the rest of this drama unfolds..so Im off to read Naughty 2!!!"
5,HOTTTTTTTTT DAMN!!!!!!!!!!!,"My entire world is spinning right now after finishing this book! This book is so hot, that I need to turn the a/c on! Jaylin is a force to be tamed, but can he be? Nokea is a jewel and a pain at the same time! Scorpio & Felicia are too deep to even comment on and then there is Stephon who is just uncontrollable! I am getting ready to start book number two but you need to get started on this series RIGHT NOW!!!!! Great Job Brenda!"
5,What a PAGE TURNER!,"It's been a very loooong time since I read a book from the first page to the end, without stopping. I had to literally put the brakes on with this one and pull my car over so I could finish. I've been reading these books out of order, but am truly enjoying them. To say I love this series would be an understatement. Wow!!"
4,Too hot for me,"This was a nice read but I don't think I can stick with it.. I wanted to find out what happens in the end so I skimed thougth the reviews for the other books. It seems nobody gets any smarter. It infuriates me to no end none of the women are strong enough to stand up to jaylin I don't care how good the dick is... I really like nokia but for goodnes sake couldn't she be the one strong black chick in this book.I guess I'm a romantic I love a happy ending even if the two people I want to get together end up with differant people.But it seem with this series of naughty books it's gonna have to much dramma which would have me cursing left and right...I can't take it. So I'll just wait till the series end and I hope its soon to find out if nokia and jaylin finally end up monagamously faithful to each other or go there separate way, with someone else. But to those who love drama and can stand the pressure this is one hell of a page turner.:)"
5,As Naughty as You Wanna Be,"Good novels contain two things - interesting, developed characters and a well-crafted plot. It doesn't hurt to have an above average storyteller either.Author Brenda Hampton has accomplished all these things and more. ""Naughty"" brings the drama and captures readers.Jaylin Rogers is unlike any character I've read before. His actions and attitude unleash an array of emotions, setting the other characters on their own course of action.""Naughty"" was hard to put down and I can't wait to see what happens in ""Naughty 2."""
1,Tricked,"Why didn't they explain that this is the same book that she already wrote, just different covers.... I was so excited thinking it was another installment and I started to read it only to realize I've heard this story before... very disappointing."
4,DJ{New Jersey},"I enjoyed this book, but it made me sad because there are so many women like these characters. It was good to see that Jaylin did have a heart when it came to Mackenzie"
1,car charger,"The car charger I got with this purchase would not fit my phone. I ordered another one hoping to recieve the correct one, but instead I recieved an identical one which also would not fit my phone. You might want to get this problem corrected. The other two pieces in the combo pack were fine. Thanks"
1,didn't fit our phones,I threw away the packaging before realizing the charger and holder didn't fit my phone
5,Jamaica Me Laugh,"If you're looking for fun and laughs wrapped in a good mystery, this is your book. It is funny and entertaining, but most of all it's a nice, tight story. Zack Chasteen says all the things we think to say an hour too late, and he does all the things we know we should have done but were too chicken. I hope Chasteen and his friends stick around for many more island adventures."
4,"Fun, fast witty storyline and great characters","Jamaica Me Dead is the 1st book I've read by Bob Morris. I've since purchased his other novels, which I look forward to reading them soon.Jamaica Me Dead draws you in from the start and keeps you interested in it right to the very end. I really liked the main character of Zack Chasteen. The writing is fun, witty, edgy and the storyline is a good one and keeps you wanting to read it through to the very end. I also loved the shorter chapter lengths as I read this on vacation.The ending was a tad predictable... I guessed who dunnit towards the end of the novel, which was why I gave this novel a 4 out of 5 stars."
2,Disappointing for Bob Morris,"My first Bob Morris book was Baja Florida. It took about 60% to get to the really exciting part but I thoroughly enjoyed the thrill and excitment. This book seemed to drag on and on with tedious detail of a political fight in Jamaica. In the end Monk DeVane who was supposed to be dead shows up for about 10 minutes only to die again in an explosion and then the book ends. This Morris novel was painful to get through only to have a mediocre ending. Morris is a favorite of mine, but this one was a big yawn for me."
4,"Mystery, humor, appealing protagonist.","Jamaica Me Dead, author Bob Morris' second entry in the the Zack Chasteen series, contains plenty of good-natured humor. It's hard not to like the self-deprecating Chasteen, a former NFLer who prefers not using firearms.This time around, Zack places himself in harm's way as he accepts the position of bodyguard to a Jamaican millionaire whose life is being threatened by persons unknown. Jamaica Me Dead has some very interesting characters among its supporting cast. Especially noteworthy is the mystical Boggy, Zack's Taino Indian friend and Kenya Oompong, a fiery female candidate for Jamaican Parliament.Without clubbing the reader over the head with politically charged rhetoric, Morris manages to effectively describe the abject poverty that exists in a country the rest of the world knows only as a vacation paradise.Jamaica Me Dead qualifies as a 4 star effort. Recommended to readers who enjoy mysteries set in exotic locales."
3,Another Hulk?,"Usually Toybiz does a decent job of creating figures of lesser - but well loved - Marvel characters, but did we need a Maestro? We need another Hulk figure like another Ghost Rider figure. The toy is well sculpted and comes with a detachable helmet. The best part of this series is the Apocalypse figure."
4,Drama of Trauma,"Like a tidal wave of tension and emotion, rising and falling with love and betrayal, and finally crashing down to beach us on a hard reality I never imagined."
4,A superb thriller,We know from the beginning that Harrison Ford is innocent.But all the evidence prove he is guilty.Then you ask yourself:a) Will an innocent be found guilty.b) Who is the murderer.One of the HF's best movies.
4,Harrison Ford,Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors. This movie was very suspenseful and full of surprises. This was shipped to me in good condition and also in a very timely manner. I would suggest the seller to anyone. Harrison Ford did a great job of acting in this movie.
2,Snooze fest....,"You will have to waste 2 hours of your life in this dreary slow movie to get to the answer of who did it...and the answer is the same old cliche. This movie is not thrilling, it is not engaging, it is just boring. And why was this movie shot in what looks like the Pacific NW and Chicago?"
2,the killer didn't do the math,"Spoilers within:Ridiculous ending. What on earth were the producers thinking? There was NO indication -- throughout the movie -- that the killer was so crazy, that the person couldn't put together even the most basic thought process of how their actions would set Sabich up for a fight for his life. I mean come ON, a simple 2+2=4 would have done it, you wouldn't need to finish a dissertation in Mathematics to figure that much out. I always hate it when the surprise is that a movie character turns out to be just plain silly."
1,A disgrace to any integral female,There are two main female characters in the plot: one is a man-eater who will sleep her way to the top (although she may not even need it because she is good independently) and the other is the jealous and depressed housewife who gave up her career for the sake of her husband's. This is a man's fantasy and nightmare come true in one; and a boring cliche for all the intelligent and responsible females of the world. To all the Hollywood men out there: You can't brainwash us anymore with your b/s; okay???
4,A n excellent murder mystery!,"This movie is filled with suspense and drama from beginning to end.It will keep you guessing right up till the closing credits. The cast, including Harrison Ford and Gretta Scacchi, are terrific. If you enjoy movies such as Primal Fear, Body Heat or The Jagged Edge you're sure to love this one.I'd highly reccomend you add this gripping thriller to your video collection."
5,Worth the read!,Eyes Off the Prize removes the ambiguity about the history of the human rights movement. It is a well-documented account of history and struggle that captures the lived experiences of social movement actors of the era.
5,Love this Magazine,Living in Sunny SO Cal I get to fish quite a bit during the summer months and get great tips from this magazine that isn't focused totally on either east or west coasts. It gives sound advice with plenty of interesting articles. I've renewed 2x already and am hooked (no pun intended). Great product reviews as well.
5,Ideal RV Heater Element,"Replaced the 1500W element in my motorhome (Atwood water heater) with this 1000W one. Although it takes a few minutes longer to heat a tank, I have plenty of time. When traveling with the generator running (for A/C), I can turn ON the water heater and arrive with hot water for showers. [For safety, the propane is _ALWAYS OFF_ when on the highway. ]"
3,rusting,"Works fine but has started to develop rust quite severely installed in a copper heating tube I designed. Granted, there isn't a sacrificial anode in the design to protect it, but it will rust, FYI."
2,Poet Thinks Too Much,"I saw some wonderful cagy things going on in Emanuel's first two books. But now comes THEN, SUDDENLY, which deconstructs itself word by word as it goes along, and in a very transparent manner. (The everyperson's answer to Jorie Graham will have to wait.) THEN, TO TOP IT ALL OFF the poems are flat. The life seems to have been revised right out of them. ""When the reader's radar tracked me down"" Emanuel writes. What happened? The answer is, You thought about it too much and the result is stiff, self-conscious poetry."
5,Clean and long lasting,"I like a clean, not overly fragrant and masculine scent. Typically I prefer scents that remind me of water. Insense Ultramarine met my expectations. It is also a very long lasting scent and stays with me for 8 - 10 hours. It just takes a little and is appropriate for work."
5,Dreamy Smell...,I love it. I simply love the smell of this blue perfume. There is another perfume from Givenchy named Blue and It's good too but This one is something that makes ladies remember the man who wears it!
3,Good live septet session from early 80's on budget label,"This is a good live septet session recorded at Buddy's Place in the early 1980's. Rich's drumming is so powerful on the opener, ""Donna Lee', that he virtually renders the sax soloist superfluous, as Buddy and Anthony Jackson could have carried the tune on their own. ""Chameleon"" finds him also pushing the band from behind, though the funky electric wah-wah on Jack Wilkins' guitar chords offers a stronger counterweight. Unfortunately, this track ends in a truncated fashion after only about 4 minutes of grooving. The recording is also a little murkier than the best technology of the day might have offered. Nevertheless, there are solos from Wilkins, Kenny Barron, Sonny Fortune, and Sal Nistico worth hearing, in addition to the leader's virtuoso performance.Buddy Rich - DrumsSonny Fortune - Sax (Alto), Sax (Soprano)Jack Wilkins - GuitarSal Nistico - Sax (Tenor)Michael Abene - Piano, KeyboardsKenny Barron - PianoAnthony Jackson - Bass"
3,"Watch it, if only for the cameos...","Not a great movie, but there are some hilareous scenes. The cameo appearences were great. Lesley-Anne Down as a southern call girl is a scene worth seeing the movie for in itself."
3,"[Three out of Four] Raunchy at times, but Rodney's third best film","Real good performances from Dangerfield,Reynolds, Ogden Stiers, et, al. Some ofRodney's obvious right wing views comethrough (For more of this, go to thescene in Back to School when he andHistory Teacher, the late Sam Kinesonhave there exchange about the p****ywimp Truman who wouldn't let Mac Arthur'go in there and blow them Commie Bas****dsout!"" Now that's what I'm talkin' about!Here, Reynolds plays Rodney's Producer;Rodney is obnoxious talk show host who'srating are dropping - his main target isOgden Stiers who plays Southern Governor.If you haven't been brainwashed by 'Poli-tical Stupidity', then you will almost dielaughing wacthing Rodney ride a DRUNKHorse through a ballroom, with a drinkin one hand and a Confederate Battle Flag(Starry Cross) in the other. HilArious!"
2,Disappointing,"MEET WALLY SPARKS, a disappointing comedy, features an excellent performance from David Ogden Stiers, playing a decent politician whose life is turned upsidedown by a trash talk show host (Rodney). Stiers makes you care about what's happening to him, a good family man who didn't ask for trouble. The rest of MEET WALLY SPARKS is leagues below the level of Stier's performance; it's as if the actor's part was edited in from a different film. As for Rodney, he delivers a number of funny one-liners, but that number isn't high enough to make MEET WALLY SPARKS memorable."
3,Shtick Sticks!,"This movie only works 'cause it's Rodney Dangerfield. He has some bizzarely hilarious on screen presence that really gets me. His movie aren't classics, but they're really good for some belly laughs. I wish we could give half marks, because Wally deserves that EXTRA half of a star for it sex filled toilet humor that works every time. I wouldn't suggest buying it, for how many times can you watch Wally getting his nuts bitten by a squirl (don't answer that!)? But if your in the mood for crude mindless hilarity, Wally truely does 'spark', but sorry, no fireworks here."
1,$150 for a piece of USELESS gadget!,"My Palm Zire 31 died after 8 months. The internal battery drained very fast. I often used the MP3 function and barely used appointment/calender. For some reasons, I left it uncharged (as I usually kept charging the machine with the adapter) for a day or two and the machine died completely. The machine lasted only 8 months. This technology sucks. It is a bad experience for me and now I don't trust PDAs, or any other handheld computers."
3,Decent Palm,"The one thing that I think is really bad about this Palm is that there are only 2 buttons on the front which prevents you from playing many games. Although my Zire 31 has had to be hard-reseted 2-3 times- it is still a decent Palm for beginners.Edit: The screen of my Zire 31 has broken after a minor drop in a car. I have sent it back to PalmOne and is waiting for it to be repaired. This is one of the biggest problems with Palms. After 1 small drop, the screen most probably will crack. This is still a good Palm if you don't care about, a Digital Camera, Bluetooth, etc. (If you do I would reccomened the Zire 72)In conclusion, the Zire 31, is worth the $150, if yo don't care about the ""fancy"" stuff."
2,No longer being supported,It was expensive considered that the software is no longer being supported. I have a hard time with synchronizing it with Windows 7 PC. The battery is not holding up charges very well. Sometimes it doesn't charge even after being plugged in for a long time. I think this product is obsolete.
1,It didn't work. Was returned,It didn't works. Was returned to the sender. It was in bad conditions. I received my money back. I still need one.
5,Palm Zire 31 keeps me on track,"Got one of these about a year ago after missing a few back-to-back meetings in the midst of 2 big projects and continuing production support. Up until then I'd always disparaged PDAs and other ""executive toys"", but something had to be done. A refurbished Zire 31 fit the bill perfectly. Now, no matter where I am, I get alerted when something's coming up and can also do long range planning while taking a healthy walk at lunchtime. Those walks are also less boring now that I can listen to downloaded podcasts or music using the mp3 player feature of the Zire 31. I haven't had any crashes or other technical problems with my unit, and the refurb came from the vendor in near mint condition."
1,High failure rate.,"I bought this for my son, and have not had a good experience with it. I am in the process of returning a second one. After speaking with Palm tech support, I discovered that this is not an unusual problem. You're able to use it for awhile, then it turns itself off and won't turn back on. You can't do a hard or soft reset. We'll see. Maybe third times the charm."
2,The Stupid Things they Dont Tell you!,"Quick Plus: Its small, can be cheap on sale, outstanding battery life, probably wont ever crash.BIG MINUS - all the zires have a 90 day warrantee, give me a break! When you use the given cd it also installs programs you never asked for, and there is no way to view from the desktop installed programs or remove them. You must go to the pda itself and manually remove them, leaving behind debris. This is a very poor design and feature.Finally if you buy a palm card with programs, many will not transfer to the palm, which means your expanded memory slot is blocked and therfore can not save data or run additional programs.The os is nice becuase it just does one thing at a time, and fast, unlikely to crash, but the resoluton 160x160, 90 day warrantee, and dumbware is not worth it. Spend another $50-$100 get high res, 1 year warratee and an os desktop that lets you see and remove programs. Duh!"
1,Just went dead-No support from Palm,"After about 120 days of having this product (which I just started to use recently), it went completely dead! It won't turn on, and I have exhausted all of the reset options available through online support. When I contacted customer service via the telephone, I was told (emphatically) that my 90 day warranty has expired and they cannot help me. I was then told that if I send the Palm in for repair, the cost is a minimum of $75. If Palm wont' stand behind their products for more than 90 days, I don't think they're worth purchasing."
2,Info held hostage!,"I have had my Zire 31 four months. As a teacher I rely on the calendar, contact, memos and tasks features. It is 1 week until school begins and after I loaded my 2005/2006 student and class information it froze up. I was in love with it up until today. I am lost with my information held hostage! Resitting hasn't solved the problem. Don't waste your $100; put another $150 with it and upgrade to a Zire 72. The battery life on the PalmOne's suck however they are user friendly."
1,battery life sucks!,i 'upgraded' (???) to this from my m105 and what a DISAPPOINTMENT!! the battery was dead before i used it for half a day. i could use my m105 for WEEKS before i needed to replace batteries. i took it back within 2 days. battery life is very important when you aren't anywhere where you can sync it or recharge the battery...all that hard work GONE!
3,Now the audio is broken...,"Well, it lasted a year and a half.I bought my 31 for 2 reasons.1. to be able to see my Outlook calendar on the go. i had to buy additional software to be able to do this.2. to listen to music at the gym. the audio is now broken.I can still use it for my Outlook, but the sound for alarms does not work. so it's like a pocket electronic calendar for me now, that i have to charge frequently."
3,Only have 110 V adapter,"As most people know, it is a good handheld for just being an organizer (just contact and scheduling). The resolution is just readable; nothing much fancy (you can personalize the background though!). Good to have if you don't want to use other functionsOne thing I want to raise is that it only has a 110 V adapter. So if you travel to other countries that use other rate, you need to pay 30 extra for a universal adapter, which should have had become standard long time ago. Just this point, it doesn't pass my requirement."
4,Very good cost x benefit,This product includes basic features and some additional functions (like MP3 support) for a handheld organizer with a low price. It didn't win a 5 star because your color display has no good quality for photos.
4,Love my new appointment book,"This item works great for me. I needed a ""to do"" list along with a calendar. This works great as both. However,the visual effects are not that great but for the price and my needs, it is fine. I love the feature of synchronizing my info onto the desktop in case the Palm Pilot gets lost. This could be a lifesaver."
5,Zire 31 as an ebook reader.......,I bought the zire 31 and a 1 gb memory card for use as an ebook reader because most ebook readers are over 300$ and they only read ebooks..... This pda may not be top of the line but as an ebook reader it rocks! I can read all day on this thing i bought the 5$ upgrade to ereader and can change the screen orentation text and background color large/small font normal/bold text. I used ReaderWorks Publisher(free)to convert almost any text format to LIT then used ABC amber LIT converter (free)to convert any lit book into pdb format which is what the pda ereader uses! Works like a charm =) not to mention it plays mp3's video audio books =)
1,I am sorry that Handspring sold out to Palm,"I don't often take the time and trouble to review products, but the Palm Zire was so awful that I felt it needed addressing. Sure, it worked okay at first but it used Palm's 2-stroke script which is annoying at best. I never could make a ""K"" on it which is a real pest because my first dozen entries were family and my family name has a ""K"" in it.The reason that this is written in the past tense is that the thing lasted about 1 year before it totally failed to work for no apparent reason. Sitting on my desk it just croaked. My prior PDA at least had an excuse .. I drowned it in a rainstorm. The sole redeeming grace was that i kept the gadget synched. My experience soured me on PDAs and I have done without for a while. And if I do get one, there is no way it is going to be a Palm."
4,Basic-ly perfect,"It's a palm, which means great quality. It does everything I want it to do, reminds me of appointments, B-days (it automatically moves B-days from contacts into calenders- Sweet!), keeps all my notes, scribbles, phone numbers, and tasks in one easy place. I also got the isolo program and have a couple of books to read on the bus. The graphiti program actually works better on this older model than my husband Tungsten.The downfalls? It has 14 MB of memory. It's hard to believe when my thumb drive holds more, and the largest SD card it holds is a gig. So it's a great organizer, but if you want to use it to listen to music, get ready to carry several memory cards. It works perfect for my basic needs and for a quarter of the price of the newer models- it was more than worth it!!"
2,Defective on arrival,"The scroll function did not work so I had to return the first order. The second item arrived and would not open up beyond the ""Congratulations"" screen. The second product has been returned, and the third item has just arrived. We'll see what happens. I hope I don't have to write another product review...."
2,Good if you never have to use it outside.,"I liked my Zire 31 until I tried to use it outside. Outdoor light totally washes out the screen. My old Cassiopeia may be plain but at least I can use where ever I am. The Zire should be labeled ""For Indoor Use Only"". This puppy is going back to the store."
3,The basic Palm (carry a paper clip),"Bought one for my wife - I believe in buying the cheapest Palm possible because you won't be brokenhearted if if breaks or you lose it. I think this was the cheapest Palm at the time. Pluses: The cheapest Palm out there, but has plenty of memory for extra data and programs (especially if you get an SD card) and a backlight to make the screen readable. Minuses: Short battery life compared to its non-backlighted Zire cousins.If you use it as an MP3 player, you will get two or three hours play off a charge. Requires SD card for MP3. 160x160 pixel screen. Carry a paper clip if you run Real Player or similar large apps because they will frequently lock up your device so you can't turn it off.But if you just need address book, calendar, alarm clock, notepad, basic games, bare-bones MP3 capabilities, etc, this model will be perfectly adequate."
4,Palmone Zire31 Great - Desktop Software Problems,My daughter gave me the Palmone Zire31 for Father's Day. I've used digital diaries and appointment software calendars for years but this one has been great. I do have problems with the desktop software and tech service. The looks and use of it can be compared to Franklin Planner but my software froze up and there is no real person to help with fixing the problem. I cannot even delete the software to start over again.
2,not compatible,"I could not keep this product because VISTA IS NOT COMPATIBLE!!!! I then purchased, from you, a Tungsten E2 and finding out that VISTA IS NOT COMPATIBLE for this either. This is the most frustrating problem I have dealt with since I started using the computer in the early 1990's! MICROSOFT has developed a lame program and all manufacturers that deal with the computer that is not a MAC has to bow down to them which is wrong and not good business practice."
4,Great for the Price!,"The PalmOne Zire 31 is great for the person who doesn't want a large planner to carry around. I use mine everyday both as a student and for work so it serves it's purpose. The software is a bit outdated and the memory space is small compared to the newer technology but if you're only using it for everyday meetings, assignments, and schedules; there is plenty of space. I actually have never tried playing music on it but I'm sure an IPOD or IPhone would be much better. All in all, it serves it's purpose and the price was great! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a beginner planner."
3,Nice,"I bought this palm pilot to keep track of my day to day hectic schedule. It really helps. It has lots of features which I haven't tried yet, but it works well for what I needed it for which is keeping a calendar of all my appointments and having an alarm to remind me."
1,Palm One Zire 31,Don't buy this product. It didn't work right from the beginning and completely failed after 5 months.It only has a 90 day warranty and they would do nothing for me. It is now in the trash.
2,Eh.....,Ok.... when i got this pda i thought it was soooo cool. But then after a few days it wasn't so great. The graphics aren't that good. And i had to return it because the screen froze and would not turn off. I called tech support they said it was a common problem.... spend the extra 50 bucks and get a better one. WASTE OF MONEY. =D
2,not worth it,This palm is dated. You should spend the extra $100 and get something a little more up to date.
5,This palm is for my Nephew,"He really like this, he said that it's very good. For me the price was really cheap and motivated me to buy it."
2,Okay... while it lasts,"This is the fourth Palm-branded device my husband and I have had die over the last several years. Quality control seems poor. Granted, my Zire 31 lasted about 2 years and worked fair - some compatibility issues with my Mac and some medical software (Epocrates). Good for basic tasks, calendar, etc. Small memory limits many of the newer applications. My husband's Zire 31 seemed to have battery trouble after about 1 1/2 yr but after multiple attempts at fully charging, syncing and hard resets his still functions. Mine just will no longer turn on, despite any actions."
1,A bitter disappointment,"I received this as a Father's Day present, and I was thrilled with it. Two months later it stopped working. I guess I was fortunate that it was still under warranty, but the replacement one that they sent failed after a couple of days. Now I'm paying to mail that one sent back to be replaced. I'm not too optimistic. Almost all of the reviews for this PDA are very positive. However, if you look at some of the other Palm units, the reviews start out positive, but then go south after it has been on the market long enough for them to start dying. The worst part for me is that three months ago, I was satisfied with a paper planner and phone book. Now I need a PDA, but mine doesn't work."
2,Battery and charger.....,I have had it less than a year and charging the battery as with all the palms is a major disappointment. They don't last very long. Palm is great but what is great if it doesn't charge. Thanks to service plans I have exchanged every palm I have had due to defective batteries now they know better and don't have the plans like they used too. My advice: Buy something with a replaceable battery you can do yourself.
1,"Great while it worked, not so good after it died","I loved this piece of equipment, beautiful screen, light weight, easy to use....then one dayDEATH!!! no suicide note, nothing...it just quit working! I had even bejeweled it with crystals but that was not enough to keep it alive!Palm has a bad rep for fixing it's ""broken"" items so i won't even bother. This is a good device but be ready to replace it in about a year"
4,Upgraded to Zire 31 from Palm V,"I purchased two Zire 31's. The Zire 31 has many nice features compared to the Palm V. The one problem was with the Desktop software upgrade. My Memo and Task categories were lost and I had to delete all of my old Tasks to prevent the software from crashing when I tried to display Tasks on the right side of the Calendar screen. Having two cables, (hotsync and charging) is not as nice as having a cradle. The picture feature is very nice. The bottom line is that once we got past the hurdle of converting the data from the Palm V, my wife and I are both very happy with the Zire 31. I also did quite a bit of research and Amazon had the best price and shipping was extremely fast, even with the lowest price option."
5,Great Starter PDA - All the basics in one place,"I have been using my Zire31 for about 3 weeks and love it. I juggle so many things during the course of a week that I needed something that went beyond the traditional Daytimer. This is it!The Zire31 isn't loaded with unnecessary stuff that I would not use (like a digital camera or cell phone; I have those already) and perfectly handles scheduling tasks and meetings, sounding an alarm when those are due, enabling me to read ebooks, listen to MP3 files (although I have an ipod for that), and store my favorite photos. It also has applications for expense reports, memos, a calculator, contact list, calendar, and clock. Lastly, I can enter information by synching information from my ibook (yes, I'm a Mac person and the software works perfectly; don't worry, if you are a PC person, it works with Windows too) or can enter stuff directly into my Palm by writing on the screen.It's very convenient and I'm very pleased so far."
5,"Great Palm, but fragile","I got this product for my birthday and it is great! There is one drawback though. It is quite fragile. I recommend getting a good case, one that flips open so it can not slide out accidentally. I also recommend getting a service contract or extended warranty to cover any accidental damage. I had a case that opened like a book and it dropped right out . I had to exchange it. I like the color screen. And the Real One player option. Overall this a great Palm. Oh, one more thing, I also recommend a large memory card."
3,Is my unit defective?,"All of the positive coments you've read are true: it's a great value for the money and easy to use. One problem overshadows all, however: The screen is virtually blank outdoors in sunny weather. I've tried all availavle screen colors and settings, to no avail. IT CANNOT BE USED OUTDOORS. This really hit home when, having been involved in a traffic accident on a sunny day, I was unable to view the phone number of my insurance company! You can't even tell if it's off or on in the sun. If you may ever need this outdoors, look elsewhere!"
4,PalmOne Zire 31,"Even though I bought this used, it still works fine. The only thing I dontlike is that the battery runs down to fast. Four songs and fifthteen min. of reading a book took me down to half of battery power. Other than that this was a good buy, I'm now able to read my Sherlock Holmes books."
2,Closeout Sale Came Without Warranty,"This is our second Palm item and we had problems. Worse, the item arrived with an announcement that there is no warranty given! This was not in the advertisement on Amazon. Without a warranty I would not have bought it. We have already had problems. It has froze up. Then we had problems resetting it and now the transfer with cable is not working (software/hardware does not recognize the USB connection which prevents us from even resetting it and reinitiating)! It would be a good product IF it wasn't so difficult to keep operational! Right now it is a paperweight."
4,Great little PDA,"I recently got the Zire 31 and thePalm Z22 Handheld(for my wife). For me it was to replace my trusty IIIxe; its the first PDA for my wife. We both like them a lot. The pluses of the 31- speed, color, applications, SD card slot. The minus- 160x160 screen, only 14 mb memory, can hold only 1 gig SD card. I like the Z22 also, but the screen is a tad smaller and it has no SD card slot. My wife has quickly learned to use it for jotting notes and other items that used to go on slips of paper, besides using the calender.Palm has improved the calender function but I still recommend the DateBk program from Pimlico. I used DateBk 3 on my IIIxe so I could see my todo lists with appointments, and am trying out DateBk 6 on my 31. It is very powerful with many functions/options/views not in the palm datebook.I was looking at the TX, but for its price I got two very good PDAs. Overall we are both pleased."
4,Great product,I have been using this palm for just at 30 days and really enjoy it. I have yet to fig out the photo feature and can not give it more than 4 for that reason only.
2,It crashed on me the first two weeks I had it,"I had the thing for two weeks and it crashed and I lost all my information. It was a good thing I found out so I could return it on time, but Amazon won't send me my return label to send it back and I've had it for over a month and it's just sitting here. Spend more and you will get better quality. I always say you get what you pay for and I I went for cheap and got a cheap product."
5,Excellent Value,"This is a great little PDA. It is simple to use, has plenty of memory, and comes with all the basic programs you will need. I had an old Handspring PDA, which needed replacement. I went online and did some research. This one came up with the most positive reviews, and the least negative ones. I didn't want one with a bunch of bells and whistles. I needed one that kept all my addresses, phone numbers and calendar entries. As an added bonus, when I synched up the Zire, all my data, games and add-on applications from the old Handspring came across intact. I recommend this to anyone who wants a basic PDA that is easy to use and is reasonably priced."
4,The Pierces,"This cd is GREAT! Great, mellow music with AMAZING voices! If you like the Indigo Girls, you'll love this southern sister duo."
5,Amazing,"The Pierces are among the finest musical artists I have ever had the privilege of hearing. The first time I heard them play was in a coffee shop in Birmingham, Al, but I knew even then that they had star quality. I have eagerly anticipated the release of their first album. It's arrival exceeded all my expectations. Their voices climb and fall, the melodies mingling in a gorgeous swirl of harmony. The talent they posess is beyond compare. Their passion for music shows through in every gut-wrenching lyric. They sing of love and life, and each song will speak to your heart. I love you Allie and Cat!"
5,fielding is responsible,their father and i played in a band together in 1970. i think there great.allison is a good percussionist. and they sound great together. p.saling
2,Bland and Boring,"Could this possibly be the same group who created the absolutely brilliant ""Thirteen Tales of Love and Revenge""? The Pierces' ""The Pierces"" is bland and boring, the tunes redundant and indistinguishable from their equally as boring and uninspired ""Light of the Moon."" I bought ""Thirteen..."" first and loved it so much I went searching for their other albums. Unfortunately, their other albums have turned out to be a bitter disappointment. If you like witty, snarky, snappy beats with a little black humor, stick with ""Thirteen Tales of Love and Revenge"" and forget the rest."
4,why aren't they famous yet?,"Last summer I was in a friend's car and she popped in the pierces cd...first i noticed the beautiful harmonies and simply the unique sound of the music, but then i began to listen to the lyrics. they really moved me! it's a great CD because in one way, every person can probably relate to the message each song conveys. How many of us have felt, ""All I want is what I cannot have""? Yeah, well then THE WAY is your song. The guitar music is great, along with the relaxing tone of the CD overall. The only thing that's lacking is a true hard core happy song to lift up the mood of it a bit. if you like natalie merchant and sarah maclachlan, you'll love the pierces."
3,Credible Start for The Pierces,"The vocals on this CD are amazing. Obviously, The Pierces are credited with utilizing incredible harmonies. However, each of their voices stand alone as great talents.The lyrics on this CD are not as wonderful as the voices singing them. It is obvious that the group just sort of wrote and ran with what they had. As a result, the songs seem fit for a junior high school student to sing. Most of the songs sound very similar as well and can get boring near the end.It is a shame that ""Save Me"" was not included on this CD. However, thankfully five years later the sisters added it to their second CD.The best songs on this album are ""Blood"" and ""I'll Be Dreaming."" They are very simple, beautiful and not overwhelmingly trite.It seems that the sisters, if they have the tenacity it takes in the industry, are on their way to certain success. They could even reach the respectability of Sarah McLachlan or a mellow, happy Fiona Apple."
3,OK Plus,"This is apparently the Pierces one CD, recorded in 2000. It opens with the best and most striking cut -- The Way. I heard it on a CMJ sampler and gambled on the rest of the CD. It doesn't match up. Yes, as all reviews here agree, the harmonies are wonderful throughout, but after a while on this 13 song CD all those wonderful harmonies start sounding pretty much identical. And that's a problem. Where you can detect individuality, it is all in Allison's songs -- The Way, Take You Home, and the mysterious and slightly creepy Jeffrey. Catherine's best is Waiting. Can't tell if it's a production problem or a music writing/arrangement problem, but the Pierces needed to do a better job of distinguishing these songs from one another. If they are still recording, and one hopes that's the case for they write well, if erratically, and they have great voices, I hope they are working on that."
3,Earbud audio volume is way too low,"It works, barely. The audio from the earbud is too low and makes hearing a phone conversation a chore. Get the Panasonic headset with the cup earphone instead. Works MUCH better."
3,"Good story, but lacking","I found this book in a coffee shop. I was most interested in the later books in the series, but decided to start with #1. The descriptions of things and events are wonderful, most enjoyable! I felt I could ""see"" what the author was describing. The events near the end of the book happened too swiftly. The pace of the book, at this point, was distracting, with too much happening. It ended suddenly. But from what I hear, it is worth continuing the series, so I will."
3,There is No Way to Make This Premise Work,"The way the book is laid out, it would be a heck of a lot to remember. It would be like something out of a comedy if you asked what each person did, then looked it up in the book! The only people it will benefit are certain kinds of salesman, who are looking for an ""in"" with a potential client. They would need to buy it. I gave it three stars, because it is good for the folks it should be serving, but not for everyday people."
1,What do you mean I can't give it zero stars?,"This book is completely useless. You can spend hours memorizing the sample questions on how to talk to an accountant, a bodybuilder, or whatever, but all you'll be doing is conducting an interview and pretending like your informed when really your not. I don't call that communication. Save your money."
3,Not what I expected...it gives topics by occupation,"I was expecting a book that teaches you how to talk to anyone and create a great conversation. Instead, this book lists occupations and gives you topics to discuss with people if they have a certain job on that list. In other words, one needs to memorize what questions go with which job, then, if you happen to meet a doctor, for example, you can talk about the move to HMOs and the changes in healthcare business. I didn't find it very helpfull"
2,So whatta say to a vegatarian?,"I was under the impression that I was purchasing a book that would give some helpful insight as to how to carry a conversation. I was disappointed that there isn't much beyond questions to ask people when you meet them.However, I plan to hang on to this as a reference book. It is a good starting point to developing a conversation with a person you are meeting for the first time. Rather than standing there talking about the weather, or saying, ""so what do you do?"" You can actually be prepared with a few questions to get the conversation flowing.Sometimes it is just nice to know what to say when you meet a priest, wine connoisseur, cowboy or ship captain...for the first time. Afterall, this book is about, ""breaking the ice"" in conversations."
5,TONKAS LAST FOR GENERATIONS,"I AM FEMALE,IN MY EARLY 40'S, SECOND OLDEST IN A FAMILY OF 4 BOYS AND 2 GIRLS. ALL MY BROTHERS HAD TONKAS. THE TONKAS THAT THEY PLAYED WITH, ARE NOW THEIR CHILDRENS'. THE TRUCKS MAY BE A LITTLE DENTED,OR CHIPPED,BUT THEY STILL KEEP ON ROLLING. TWO OF MY 3 BOYS (12,9) HAVE HAD TONKAS SINCE THEY WERE SMALL. MY 2 YEAR OLD WILL BE GETTING HIS VERY 1ST TONKA THIS XMAS. TONKAS AREN'T JUST FOR BOYS, LITTLE GIRLS PLAY WITH THEM, I DID, AND MY 2 DAUGHTERS(21,11) DID TOO. TONKAS WITHSTAND THE TEST OF TIME."
3,"Really pretty, but...","The silver is too light for my taste. The color cheapened the beautiful design. I also bought some other silver jewelry from Amazon which had a darker tone to them. I wish this piece was just as dark. But for those who prefer bright silver, this is a really nice bracelet."
5,Go ahead and laugh,"I just finished it and cried throughout the book. I have been to one baseball game in 63 years, and only know the names of a few baseball greats, yet I loved this story. I have searched the internet. Can't find Elgin Woodell. I even went on ebay to see if I could locate one of his baseball cards. No Elgin Woodell. You know your great at writing when you convince your readers that a character in one of your novels is real. That's right, go ahead and laugh."
5,Phenomenal,"Since I reluctantly read Hometown Legend and was blown away, I've been looking at Jerry Jenkins' other books, and it's been fantastic. This is a wonderful book, and if you're a sports fan like me, you'll appreciate the incredible attention to detail and obvious sports knowledge Jerry has. However, if you're not a sports fan, like my wife, you'll still love it like she did because of the precious characters and terrific dialogue.Do yourself a favor and buy this book!"
4,"Fast, entertaining read!","From the beginning, I knew I'd like this book. I liked Joe's street-wise comments, looking at the world through his eyes, and finding out how he was going to get himself out of the mess he'd gotten himself into. Although a killer, Joe has some redeeming qualities that keeps you hoping he'll make it out of this alive. I recommend the book if you want and can handle a lot of fast action, and a few laughs."
3,Bound For the Big Screen...,"You might have heard of ""high-concept"" movies, well this is a ""high-concept"" book. One of the world's deadliest assassins discovers he is terminally ill, so he dumps his girl, and takes out a contract on himself, which draws the attention of the world's killer elite. Of course, his lab tests were mixed up and he's not ill, and his girlfriend is pregnant and hasn't told him, etc... Oh, by the way, he only killed evil types, Klan leaders, kiddie porn barons, etc... You can guess how things go, wacky killers converge, hero takes loads of damage, girl rides to rescue, blah blah blah. Not exactly the highest prose, but kinda fun in a trashy way, sooner or later it'll end up on the big screen."
1,Not a good choice!,I bought this rain gear for a hiking trip for my son. Shortly after he put it on it tore in 3 different places and didn't do a good job keeping him dry! I bought him an XL so it was plenty big to go over his clothes so although I thought it was a good buy it ended up being a big disappointment.
4,Good product,"Good product and is still holding up after a couple of years. It doesn't get much use, but I have not noticed any deterioration of the material or anything. the only problem was that I had to trim the legs to fit my son, but that was only b/c he is (was) short."
4,Rainjammer PVC Suit,Chosen for the price and color.Will be used by older gentleman for walking out in the rainThought it might be a little thicker
2,Cheaply Made,"Bought this for a vacation with rain likely. My son used a couple of times on the trip with no problem. The next time he used it, a couple of months later, it tore all the way up the jacket next to the zipper. I guess it's good for an emergency, but doesn't last."
1,The Sound Quality of a Transistor Radio,"This cd doesn't even rate one star. Being a long-time fan of the Cats, I looked forward to their Buddy Holly Covers on this cd, however, the sound quality of the product is horrific. Avoid this at all costs. You have better sound quality from the loose change jingling in your pants pocket than you do on this. As far as I'm concerned this cd could be used either as a mini-frisbie or skeet for target practice.Buyer Beware!!!!!"
5,excellent tool plenty of power,All of my power tools are dewalt and I have no complaints. I am a remodeling contractor and use them every day.
2,An honest review,"I purchased this CD hoping to use some of the tracks in my December 23rd wedding. I come from Irish heritage and wanted to honor it in some way; I was also excited because of the 'Lord of the Rings' track.I was less than impressed with the CD as a whole. The music was not celtic in feeling, nor was the music of a high quality.Perhaps my review is based on personal opinion, but it is my review nonetheless.I hope this helps, I would not purchase this CD again if I had the opportunity - there are MUCH better celtic CD's out there!"
4,An invaluable resource!,"This book has the best, clearest summary of key issues in financial globalization, Third World debt and free-market reforms that I have ever seen (and I've seen a lot). I recommend it for academics who study globalization in their research, anti-globalization activists, and concerned world citizens in general--you'll find yourself using it as a reference!"
5,Better than Zagats!,"In this witty and helpful guide, Glave provides her reader with all the information needed to eat and drink the BEST of Santa Fe. The reviews are succinct and flavorful, the information is plentiful (with icons to alert one to great takeout options, family-friendly locales, romantic spots, pricing), and the layout is clean and accessible. Eat Drink helped me find the right spot for the right occasion -- and I don't plan to return to Santa Fe without my copy close at hand!"
4,Carlos Vives does it again...,"This is not a new title. I owned it before. Lost it--you don't want to know how--and ""could not live without it"" so I order it again... Very enjoyable. The ""Diosa Coronada"" is one of the best. The accordion, the liveliness of it all, the flutes...and Carlos, of course; all the touches are there to create a thoroughly enjoyable CD. I highly recommend it..."
4,great debut,"Listening to spinner.com, I kept hearing things I liked on the new jazz channel...It kept being ""Parable"" by Pete McCann. After a few weeks of hearing it, i finally clicked through to amazon and ended up buying 2 copies. The CD had an even wider range of styles than I heard on the internet radio. Great job, keep it up. Kudos to the sax players on the CD, they are great too, and Matt Wilson's drumming shines."
4,price,"the price per package was extremely expensive. I liked the product very much,but checking prices at a local grocery store it was half the price per package"
3,It's alright...,"Believe me, I love Cinnabon just as much as the next person here. I've tried all of the Cinnabon flavored items that have come out as of recently. This past weekend I picked up this flavor of Cream of Wheat. The other reviews are correct, it doesn't really taste like a Cinnabon. It is very sweet, with tastes of cinnamon and sugar, but a Cinnabon? No. Personally I think it's a bit too sweet as well. And the first bite I had, had a weird flavor to it. Not sure I'm loving this one."
2,Too sweet,"Clearly it's a matter of personal taste, but to me this is way too sweet and (as another mentioned) artificial tasting. It tastes like someone poured cinnamon air freshener into cream of wheat. Blech."
4,Facinating Content but terrible binding,"Of all the books I bought while pregnant with my first child, this was by far the most fascinating and informative. The chapter on the birthing process caused me to definitively choose natural childbirth, and I often find myself referencing sections as my child nears his first birthday. This book is also quite entertaining. Many studies mentioned in the book make great anecdotal conversation at family gatherings! That said, the binding was defective and book was in 5 pieces by the time my son was 3 months old. I hope my second copy will fare better."
5,"A ""desert island"" book","We took our 10-month-old on vacation to France last summer. With shlepping all her gear, there was very little room to spare in our 22-lb baggage allotment. My partner still laughs at me because I insisted on dragging along this thick, heavy hardbound book -- I couldn't put it down! And it was worth every ounce. I wished I'd read it when my daughter was tiny and colicky, as the sections on newborns' unfinished nervous systems would have been invaluable. I was also fascinated by the calm and factual discussion of the nature vs. nurture debate. I recommend this to all new parents (along with ""Sign with Your Baby"" by Joseph Garcia)."
3,Reads like a textbook treatise on brain synapses.,"This book contains an impressive amount of information, but I cannot get around to sitting down and really reading it. I keep feeling like a student studying for a biology test. The writing style is really really dry! I wish that this very valuable information was put in a way that a busy mom can read! Also, I felt like the title is misleading. It talks a lot about prenatal and first year development, and much less from 1 year up to 5 years. If you are looking for regular development milestone information, this book is not it."
1,had to stop reading,"I was excited to read this book but I had to stop reading once I saw she talks about ""sewing kittens eyes shut"" to see how they develop. I am sure there will be people who criticize me for my feelings and beliefs, but for me, I find that type of testing cruel and unnecessary. i just couldn't read this book anymore. there are other helpful books out there for those that are sensitive like me.I am not writing this review to get attacked or to open a debate. I just wanted to mention this in case someone else like me is super sensitive to things of this nature and is considering buying this book. I know several other reviewers mentioned other disturbing animal experiments as well. I would read their reviews too before purchasing."
5,Interesting and informative,Author does a very good job of balancing between easily understandable information and detail.Very interesting and enjoyable book.
5,Great book for anyone with kids,"The two reviews below have great information about the book so I will just give my opinion.This book was great! The author is funny and smart all at once. Some of the information is a bit technical but she explains it really well. I love how she starts each chapter with a funny little story, like using a paper box for a make-shift bassinet.One reviewer gave it a 1 and said this book is more for students than parents. I couldn't agree less! I love knowing how my baby's brain developed and why she does certain things.This book is definitely going in my permanent library!"
4,Very Informative,I am about 20% through this book but now the details are getting boring; I'm also closer to my due date and sitting is not as comfortable as it was 2 weeks ago. It is easy to read and follow; I'm sure after a week off I'll get back to reading - it's just so interesting how quickly development happens and the effect it has on the baby at birth.
1,the title is totally misleading,"I am giving this book a one star because I expected it to be a balanced overview of the ""first five years of life"", as it states in its title. Actually very little of this book discusses anything after eighteen months. It is a good discussion of the brain and infancy - 460 pages of it. Buyer beware if you were expecting more."
2,The title is misleading,"""How the brain and mind develop in the first five years of life""--that is why I bought this book, and I want my money back. If you are pregnant or the parent of an infant then I'm sure you will find this book very informative and useful. However, my son is three years old and this book is useless to me. It's mostly about the brains of infants, and that's it. I'm pretty angry that I bought it thinking it was about the FIRST FIVE YEARS but really it's more like the first 18 months.I recommend ""Einstein Never Used Flashcards""."
4,Terrible binding!,"It can't be said enough - the content of the book is great, but the binding is terrible! Big chunks of pages keep falling out. I'll try to glue them back in, and the next section will fall out! TERRIBLE packaging for a great product. Bantam Books should be ashamed of themselves!"
5,fascinating book,anyone with a baby or planning to have a baby should read this -- it's full of interesting scientific information but is still quite readable (even for a sleep-deprived mother of a newborn).
2,Very Tough Read,Neither my daughter or I have made much progress reading it. It's not really written for a lay person.
1,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed. It's all about the scientific aspect of the brain (developing in the womb, how it compares to animals brains, how it develops in childhool). There's only 1 chapter at the very end on what you can do as a parent to help positively affect the growth and development of your child's brain. Skip this one!"
2,Not What I Was Looking For,"Was hoping for better information about brain formation, this book didn't get as technical as I thought. There was some interesting statistics on when to have the second and third child so they'll be smart."
1,Don't bother,"If you are looking for information about developmentally appropriate ways of thinking and expressing ideas and feelings, this is not the book for you. It may be factually correct but would be better for a student than for a parent or caregiver."
2,Best for Expecting Parents,"I bought this book when my son was 18 months old, figuring I could still get about 3 more years of info out of it. Instead I found myself wondering and even worrying whether I did the ""best"" thing back while I was pregnant and during his first year of life, as the ""perfect parent"" would. While interesting and informative, this is not a reference book you can easily look up, by age, what's going on in there for the first five years of life. The majority of the book deals with baby development, with very little info beyond the first year. For me the title was very misleading."
4,Good read but not for the casual reader,"Several of the reviews have discussed the content so I'm only writing about my impression. This is an informative book. I read this when my son was turning one year old, but I wish I had read it before or just shortly after he was born. It would have been fun to track the developmental changes as they occurred. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed it. I did find it somewhat slow and redundant, so plan to plod through it a bit. Also, this is best for someone with either a science background or a strong interest in science. If you aren't knowledgable about biology and/of basic physiology then you won't enjoy this book. My mother wouldn't have made it through the first chapter."
5,So glad I found this book,"This book does an excellent job of analyzing the latest scientific data in a readable way. It also makes the assumption that people reading the book can think and encourages parents to draw their own conclusions about how best to translate this information into everyday practice. I have been frustrated with the ""conventional wisdom"" put forth by most pregnancy and early years development books, and was very pleased with Eliot's scientific, yet comprehensible, approach. I came away feeling significantly more informed. Also, because the topic of brain development is so broad, this book serves as a very good overall reference for prenatal and infant/toddler development."
4,Very interesting,"This book gives so much wonderful info, and after reading it, I really feel that I know how to give my child a leg up in life.The only qualification I'd give--you really have to like biology to get through this book. It reads almost like a bio textbook--it is not a light read, and frankly, it is not for the person who doesn't ""get"" science."
3,"Good Book, Horrible Binding","I want to reiterate that the binding on the book is very very poor. I read the reviews before I bought it in June of 2005 and thought ""how bad could it be?"" My paperback copy began to crumble on the FIRST DAY of readying and is now in pieces. The content is very interesting, but I'd recommend trying to check a hardbound copy out of the library."
5,A Must Read....,"The author makes this topic interesting, informative and fun - all in one.Having read three other ""baby/parenting"" books, this is the only book that covers critical development and learning at these depths and keeps it on a practical/useful level. All stages - what you do - how you do it & why - before and after birth.It influences the types of things we'll buy what we won't buy and the things we'll try doing.Do yourself and baby a favor and read it the minute you know you are pregnant. I can't recommend it enough."
1,"So many errors, avoid like the Black Death","This book is filled from cover to cover with errors of fact that it should be avoided by everyone looking for a history of medieval fortifications, especially as there are so many very good ones that are out there! Avoid like the Black Death!"
3,Collective concerns,"On one level, I enjoyed this. Many of the ethical challenges were very interesting, some rather trite. It might help to advertise that this book would ideally suit groups of people who want to explore some philosophical/ethical problems together, since it is not really a book to 'read' but rather to discuss and argue over."
3,"Reminds me of the game ""Scruples"" a little bit","This book is interesting to read and think about but would actually be much more entertaining if approached in a group setting. Some of the topics seem a bit ""lite"" for discussion but I assume the author needed to fill out all 100 items.If you've ever caught yourself pondering what makes things right and wrong besides tradition you'll get a kick out of this book. The short sections make it easy to pick up for 10 minutes and put down while you ponder."
3,Fast shipper,"Great buy, just not what I thought it would be. Some may enjoy this pseudo-philosophy stuff; it's just not for me."
3,To have in your bathroom,"If you are a philosopher wanna-be and like to read in your bathroom, this is the book for you. Lots of short stories to make you think about right, wrong, be or not to be. Not a deep reading duo."
2,a useful rewrite,"The experiment in the title of this book is taken from 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, where it is done in a light and amusing way, but still makes a philosophical point. Some of the other experiments are obviously rewritten from Martin Cohen's earlier classic book of 101 thought experiments, others are old 'evergreens', but this Bagini book is a useful rewrite of the present range of philosophical stories."
3,Entertaining but a little disappointing,I like the idea of this book more than the book itself. I tried reading a few of these with my girlfriend in order to kick start some philosophical/ethical conversation but not much came of it.
2,Could Be So Much Better!,"Here is a book I wanted to like. It is a great little idea where a philosophical perspective is presented as a thought experiment -- not necessarily by the author -- and then the author 'reviews' the perspective. The good part about the book is that the perspectives and thought experiments are usually of some interest. The bad/sad/plaid part is that the author makes little or nothing of the interests he devises by collecting the perspectives. The reviews that follow each are distant and trivial.This could have been so much better if the discussion enhanced the perspectives, if there were some type of folding, multiplying, or invention. An interesting idea, a poor execution."
4,A Pretty Good Pedagogical Tool,"This book is rather like a compendium of famous problems in philosophy, which have boiled down to a concentrated one or two pages each. This said, it is not helpful to someone who has a serious scholastic interest in philosophy but would make a fine tool for introducing philsophical thought to young people and children, for whom the reading of philosophical literature is too premature but can nonetheless benefit from the logical and critical thought developed by an engagement with philosophy. I think that this book could serve as a fine base for an extracurricular philosophy group for children and teenagers."
4,Lots of fun,"Don't pick this book up late at night -- you'll have interesting questions buzzing around inside your head for hours, and never get any sleep. I'm looking forward to coming back to many of the sections in this book later and following up on them in other books.Obviously this book contains more questions than answers. Come on, it says it's for ""armchair philosophers,"" it has a picture of a pig on the cover, and there are 100 sections in 336 pages. No great depth is to be expected.So what? The book does what it should: it gets me interested in classic thought exercises that have puzzled people for hundreds of years, clearly presents major points of view, and does it in a way that's highly accessible and makes me want to read more."
5,Liked it,I like the water taste from Clear2O filter and it worked for the duration as claimed.Liked the product.
4,Fast and efficient...,I have used the Clear2O pitcher for 6 months now and I love it. It's fast a easy to use. This filter takes all the bad taste out of the water and ten time faster than drip filters.
5,Silly Verse for Kids,I bought this book for my daughter to read to her children. She had asked if she could have my old battered book.It was a favourite with her as a child and I also used to read it to my other older granddaughters when they were small. They loved the nonsense rhymes and still remember the words of some of their favourites.
5,Architectural Digest (2-year subscription),I have been subscribing to Architectural Digest for many years and this was a great opportunity to extend my subscription at a great price.
3,3 issues arrived the first week,"I signed up for a 1 year subscription and the first week, I had only 9 months left on the subscription. They sent me the current issue and 2 other issues, one a month old and one 2 months old. I kinda feel like they are giving me the bum's rush here. Great magazine, this rating is not about the magazine content."
2,Design for the Rich,"Architectural Digest is sometimes inspiring, but often looks like real people do not live in the spaces shown. Any signs of life (a book or two, family photos) are just not there. If you cover up the single bowl of apples or spray of flowers, the spaces look sterile and corporate. I enjoy minimalism, but even this can go too far. For affordable interior design that inspires, I suggest Dwell, Elle Decor, and Nest."
2,subcription problems,"I got this magazine either for free or cheap from an Amazon promotion. I decided after about 8 months that I didn't want it auto renewed which was my choice to make. After written cancellation didn't work and cancellation through my Amazon account didn't work,(3 times I tried)I contacted customer service and Amazon took care of it. I do not recommend this magazine just on that experience. Also, the magazine is about one half the size it was several years ago."
2,BUYER BEWARE - Gift Subscriptions,"I ordered this magazine as a gift for someone, and when the first issue arrived, it came to my house (the billing address) instead of the gift recipient's address. When I called Architectural Digest to have the delivery address changed, they told me that they will not process Amazon orders as gift subscriptions and, in order to have the delivery name and address changed, they would have to suspend the subscription and create a new gift order that would result in issues being delayed or left out.I have no complaints about the publication, and I have no complaints about Amazon's order processing in general, but I caution you not to purchase this magazine as a gift without verifying that the intended recipient will actually receive the magazines."
3,Love it and Hate it,"Architectural Digest varies so much. Often the interiors are quite slick, lacking sophistication and elegance. For example, Sally Sirkin Lewis' homes appear and, they like many others in the journal, lack the timelessness that high quality interiors posses. I do enjoy the sources despite the fact that many of the featured homes scream Noveau."
3,Free Subscription,"I bought a vacumm cleaner & little while later they offered me a free 1-year magazine subscription as a reward. The choices were nothing I would routinely buy (no Playboy, Maxim or any car mags), so I picked this one. Why?? Because it was the most expensive (but free) of the lot. The pictures are real good. The pages are slick too...you know - glossy."
1,Magazine for the dead or soon to be,"I cannot say enough bad about this magazine. When House and Garden was shut down last year, my subscription was replaced by AD, and every month when it comes in the mail, I basically take off the plastic wrapping to shred it and then recycle the magazine. I need to find the time to call and cancel it.There is absolutely NOTHING inspiring or interesting in this magazine. I can't help but think that only dead or extremely old people would enjoy this magazine. The interiors are dowdy, lifeless, and boring. There are no fresh or new ideas and everything is styled to look like a furniture showroom that does very little business. If I want to feel depressed and smothered, I just have to pick up this magazine."
3,Nice but Boring,"I am often amazed by how much money is spent on these homes and how little creativity is involved. I have been a subscriber [a gift from my family] for many many years and the magazine never changes. Every so often there will be something great, but there is much more beige wall to wall than anything else. Tasteful, safe and unimaginative. But of course they have high end advertisers to please. Long ago I stopped using the magazine for ideas."
2,Magazine Incorrectly named.,"It should be called ""Digest for Decorators with Unlimited Budgets."" Once a year there is an ""architecture"" issue, and there might be one article in other issues with architecture as the subject. If you really want something about architecture, you cannot go wrong with Architectural RECORD."
1,Traxxas must own RC Car Action,"I have had this magazine now for 2 years... There has NEVER been anything negative written about ANYTHING built by traxxas. Traxxas seems to be on their cover every other month. Even tho I own some traxxas rc's I am not >> live, eat, breathe Traxxas like these guys are.If I need a Traxxas fix, I think I will pocket my money and just go stare at the traxxas website for 5 sec and be done. If you are looking for any other content in this magazine besides Traxxas covers, 10 page traxxas ads (not exagerating), and short articles on things that might actually matter in the rc world.. Then you will be disappointed. Like the title says.. I think Traxxas owns RC Car Action Magazine."
2,Priced itself out of range for the average subscriber!,"Great mag but the new pricing is a bit much considering they make a bundle on advertizing, especially from Traxxus!"
5,Worth the Money,"I bought this as another gift for my boyfriend, who is an RC Car fanatic. It is a great publication for the latest in the hobby and for generating ideas for those who build and /or paint their own cars, as my guy does. We will be renewing this subscription!"
4,Cuisine island/earlier version,"I bought this a few months ago at $99 ! For the money, it is an excellent buy. Made in Thailand. Solidly built, fairly easy to assemble, though the alignment of the two doors is v-e-r-y slightly off but not enough to spoil the looks or the functionality of the cart. I am very happy with my buy. Thanks. 7/23/04."
4,Llke the characters,I have read severa books from JD Mason. I enjoyed most of them. I really like Connie and John. They seem very realistic.
5,I fell in love with this book,This author is crazy good. I was very surprised in how much I loved this book. I had my whole family read it because I felt like it was somethign you need to read. Also you have to look at her other book because there is a book the follows this one that you really could read first.
4,Great Reading,This was a really great book with a good ending.....well written and easy to read as well....I loved it!!
3,One of her good novels,I was not a fan of Mason after reading on the 8th day She Rested but this piece made me give her another chance. The story of two lovers with difficult pasts trying to make their love/life work for them. Deals with some very real situations and not very predictable like SO MANY books out today. I enjoyed reading.
4,A Great Read,"""One Day I Saw A Black King"" was a terrific story that was written beautifully. J.D Mason really helps you to understand the plight and the making of both characters and why they are the way they are as adults. What I really enjoyed about this book was that it was a realistic love story in the way Connie and John's love developed. Through all their problems and baggage they found comfort in one another and conquered their demons. The ending (which I won't give away) caught me off guard and really broke my heart for Fool and Mattie, the parents of John. Never got bored for a second."
2,Perfunctory and full of guess work,I cannot rate this publication highly as it is merely a perfunctory piece of work that contains a lot of pure guesswork. Certainly not sufficiently scholarly. I am disappointed after reading it.
4,Keeping up a well founded tradition,"Chinese University Press continues on its excellent work for bringing to the readers a China yearly review with scholarly writings on all the subjects of the Chinese studies. Only to regret is the supression of the introductory chapter which was very useful in the 8 previous China Review. I highly recommend the chapters about Reform of Nomenklatura, Cross Straits Relations, Sino-American relations and Chinese Peasants' discontent. Some articles seem do not understant the spirit of the China Review, as they focus on large historical aspects and so eludes the concrete analisis of a year of deveolpment on China issues. But China Review continues to be a must have book for Chinese Studies, as it brings the point of view of Hong Kong Shcolars."
1,Bubblegum,"Did not like it. Very hard, probably old. It was not worth the money spent. Would not buy it again."
3,"Super Bubble is great, but box from Amazon not that great.","I've purchaesed twice so far and in both boxes the gum was really hard. Product is great, but I wouldn't purchase again through amazon due to it being so hard to chew."
3,The quick review,"A good basic all around motorcycle magazine. Definitely for the mainstream and not the extreme biker, left or right."
4,Pretty good Motorcycle Magazine,The magazine is very informative and has a great selection of articles to read and advertisers to look at. Out of a five stars I give it 4....John Deere Jensen Heavy-Duty AM/FM Mini Motorcycle Radio
1,no show,"I ordered 12/16/09, as if 02/12/10 (8 weeks) I haven't received the first issue. It's taking too long."
2,Not a big fan...,I'm a HD rider and this is really not defined to that manufactor. I skim though it every month but I won't subscribe again.
1,Waste of time and money,This was a book that i needed for a college class and of course it was a waste of time and money like most college books.
3,A Far Cry From Blind,"First, so you know where I'm coming from, Metal is my preferred genre of music. Therefore, I will always view ""Blind"" as being this band's finest work. The first time I listened to this album, it was obvious that these guys have been touring with Metallica. I was, at first, tremendously disappointed as it appeared that COC was aiming for the same type of ""accessible"" sound that Metallica has been putting out ever since the Black album. But after giving this CD another chance and listening to it a few more times it began to grow on me. This album is not metal, but COC have never really proclaimed themselves as being metal anyway. And this album is, by far, the most radio-ready album they've put out to date. That being said, this is still a solid rock album that dedicated COC fans will probably enjoy, as long as they realize that the Blind-era is long gone and will more than likely never return."
3,The Black Album 2,"I think this is an obvious attempt at trying to do what Metallica did with the Black Album. They even said this at a show I saw in Winson-Salem about 2 months before this CD came out. They specifically mentioned that ""this will be our Black Album"". And then I read it somewhere else on the web later. So this recording is an effort to sell more CDs. I do respect a band growing and changing with each CD but this is obviously not the only factor behind this change.That being said, it is still a pretty good CD. It is kind of like the Black Album (Duh!) in that if I had never heard the band before, I would probably like it. It is just that I have heard their best work and so this is a little bit of a let down."
4,COC Rocks!,"I have always loved this bands sound. It's sounthern rock with a big pile of Sabbath tossed in for good measure. The sound, the texture, the lyrics, the overall energy of their cd's is simply amazing.While this release may not be everyones favorite, it's still COC full on and thiers nothing wrong with that.Pepper gets it and so the fans who follow the man and his work!!"
4,Very Good CD...Not a Classic Like Albums Past Though,"This CD didn't strike me as very good in 2000 when I first picked it up, but after several listens, it has grown on me. It's not in the same league as the classics Deliverance or Wiseblood, but still is a great piece of work by the boys from NC & New Orleans (Pepper is from New Orleans, and most of the current sound is influenced by that), not just Carolina as a previous reviewer mentioned. Standouts are: Over Me, Stare Too Long, and Sleeping Martyr. The only problem with this album is that a few tracks seem like failed attempts at commercial success: Zippo & Who's Got the Fire. Besides those, I actually tended to like their slower, more southern sounding tracks like Stare Too Long & 13 Angels. Still, 8-9 out of 11 tracks are very good. Anyway, if you are a new listener, I would suggest picking up Deliverance and Wiseblood first before ""Dealer""."
3,"Good, but not as good as I wanted.","I've heard about ""COC"" for so long, I finally decided to get an album. Though this is good, I expected them to be heavier. This sounds like ""Metallica/Nickelback"", and I was hoping for ""Kyuss/Soundgarden"". Maybe it's just this album, and not them. But still, this is good, and it does qualify as metal/hard rock. Big fans probably should pick this up, newcomers might want to get one of their other albums, I suspect they might be better. I just wish the music was as cool as the album title and cover."
5,very good album,"just recently discovered Corrosion of Conformity.. and really enjoyed their sound, its some where between Metallica's heavy metal and Crowbar's sludge."
5,One of the best albums ever made!!,"Really, can you say this not one of the greatest rock albums of all time after listening?Every song in this album is really a perfected rock/heavy song.The heartbraking lyrics, crunchy guitars, great beautiful and rough melodies and Keenans voice which just fits perfectly to the music... I've got cds from pantera to Led Zeppelin to Wallflowers to classical, and this is one of the favourite albums I own...If you haven't listened to corrosion of conformity before, this is definetly the cd I would recommend to be listened first. I've got no favourites, but wiseblood just gets my hair up!"
1,dissappointment,"Considering that _Deliverance_ is probably the best heavy album every made, this album is annoyingly feeble. I'm happy that they may finally get some big bucks--they deserve it just like Metallica deserved to become rich after they're incredible contributions to music up to, and perhaps including, Metallica _Metallica_. But don't try to convince me that it's possible to cross over AND make good music. Congratulations and goodbye. Hello, System of a Down..."
1,Filtered Passion from Lips of Love,There is a communication that takes place with small objects are placed on slippery slopes. This is due to the change in pressure between urinary tract infections and similar injustices. The musical genre in which people percieve as the corporate milieu often harbors feelings of resentment. Corrosion of Conformity explores thoughts like this and compares it to similar strains of consciousness. I would recommend that music similar to that heard on this album be given a hearty listen at least some of the time by certain specific individuals.
3,In search of a good Darjeeling tea,"I find this brand too robust, lacking the delicate floral flavour more typically associated with Darjeeling teas. I rate it inferior to Mighty Leaf, Harney & Sons, and Twinings. Might as well stick to English Breakfast!"
4,IT BROKE!...But It's Still Great,"I just recently purchased the Red Variant of this figure and was excited and pleased to have both a nice looking action figure as well as the piece of Apocalypse. But as I was setting him up, trying to move his leg it just snapped off at the hip joint. Hence the 2 star durability rating. I have never had this problem with the Legends line before, and was very disappointed, especially since it was the variant figure. Some superglue fixed the problem, but at the cost of some articulation. He is on my shelf now and looks great, but if you're giving the toy to younger children, be cautious. Like I said I have never had any problems like this with a Marvel Legends Figure before, so hopefully it was just a fluke.The figure is still well worth getting, and in fact I am going to pick up the Green version sometime in the near future."
5,Great for repotting,"The shipping was fast, and the product description was accurate. First i was scared that there was not enough soil, but it seems that they put exactly the right quantity, no way of sparing some :p I highly recommend this product for beginners who want to repot a mame bonsai."
3,Could be better,"Not enough pebbles to cover surface, soil came with weed seeds in it, should have drip tray included, and fisherman figurine didn't come with a fishing pole and has an angry expression on his face. I guess it would make a nice gift for a beginner though, or a project with a child."
1,disappointed in product condition,The book was advertised as in good condition. The physical condition of the is good except for the fact that there is notes made with a black pen on many of the pages and sentences and words were also underlined with a black pen which makes the book very difficult and irritating to read.
4,Great Book for intermediate and advanced Bassists,"As a bass player, I was looking for a bass magazine that had great articles, interviews and had a variety of good songs to learn. Well Bass player is that magazine, with interviews with players like Boosty Collins, Verdine White and Geddy Lee and with lessons on techinque and learning songs in a variety of genres (something that past bass mags never did) it is a great buy for your buck."
1,Where's My Mag?,We have been waiting since August....OF LAST YEAR!!!The check has cleared...you have all of our information....what are you waiting for?Let's see...it has now been 5 MONTHS!!!!!!!Did you rip us off?
3,Still waiting!!,"I ordered this mag in January and here it is, April, and I still haven't received the first issue. I have been on the phone with Synapse and they told me TWICE that they would get back to me with info on my subscription within 24 hours and I still haven't heard from them. The mag is great but the subscription service seems far below Amazon's usual service."
5,Fabulous magazine for bass players,"While many music rags limit their coverage to new and hip artists, while providing lots of song transcriptions, Bass Player is focused on teaching. The artists surveyed are always eclectic and exciting, and the lessons challenging and intriguing. In all, the focus of the magazine seems to me to be the philosophy of music, and is consistently intelligent and articulate. Every serious bass player would benefit from a couple of copies of this magazine."
5,Bald is Better,"This action figure is awesome, Bishop looks way cooler sporting no hair at all and losing that horrible scarf around is next. The variant is by far greater then the original. This Bishop really perceives a man from the future on a mission. Great detail, great articulation, awesome accessories and Big Guns. What else can I say, hes definable the cooler cat of the original figure."
2,"Fun, but excessive liberties with Piper's world","I recently re-read all my Piper books, then re-read this one, and came to the same conclusion I had when I bought it new years ago: it was fun to read more about fuzzies, but the author took unacceptable liberties with a world that did not belong to them.On its own it is an enjoyable and well written story, though not in anything like Piper's style. Think of it as a ""television adaptation"" of a story in the ""real world"" of Piper's Fuzzies, with the stretching and massaging that modern day TV types are genetically unable to avoid. The author tried to make this book their own, and in so doing made it an uncomfortable fit in Piper's world. Enjoy it, but don't try to think of it as the definitive extension of the Fuzzy storyline."
4,This film knocks you out of the ring!,"The '70's were loaded with field goal kicking mules, ghost busting gorillas, and then.....the boxing kangaroo! This rarely seen film is a feel good movie with excellent cast. Good for the family."
4,hilarious!!!!!!,"saw this back in 78 on hbo,one of the funniest flicks,iv ever seen. remember all the story too. thought it was out of print,but was gassed when i found one. of course the whole idea is pretty far fetched of a kangaroo fighting for the heavyweight championship,but the story is done well just the same. the ending was feel good all the way. im very glad to have this in my collection!!!"
4,Sweet debut album,"This is by far one of the best debut attempts from a band I've ever heard. When I bought Good Charlotte's self-titled album I had decently high hopes for it with hearing the singles ""Little Things"" and ""The Motivation Proclamation"". And liking both the songs alot it gave me hope but I figured just another mediocre punk band w/a few good songs. I figured wrong. The whole c.d. kicks total [...]! Every song including one of my favorites ""Waldorfworldwide"",or ""East Coast Anthem"". All the songs are catchy and great. I can't think of much to describe it but sweet so do yourself a favor and buy this c.d."
1,"Nope, I'm not GONNA stop.....","I'm not stoppin... I love to piss GC fans off, they deserve it for how annoying they arelike I said, just like ants, nice & easy to crush.... and I'm pretty sure that's the same with GC themselvesThe irony is so delicious:) :) :) :) :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :PGC SUCKS GC SUCKS GC SUCKS GC SUCKS GC SUCKS GC SUCKS"
3,A little dissapointed....,"After hearing ""The Anthem"" and ""Lifestyles"", I went out and bought Good Charlotte's first C.D. I enjoyed ""The Little Things"", ""Waldorfworldwide"" and ""East Coast Anthem"" but I was a little dissapointed by the rest of the C.D. Many of the songs sound alike and many of the gituar riffs sound the same, some ruined with a high-school band-like rapping. Many of the lyrics don't go with the music and sound juveinille. I reccomend ""The Young and the Hopeless"" instead of this C.D. It has much better and more advanced instrumentals and lyrics."
3,Screamer!,"This is the only Good Charlotte record that I still listen to.The lyrics are pretty simple but the beat is cool.They did coppy a bit of Green Day's early material in one of their songs. I also heard a bit of the Clash as well.But what can I say?Both bands were their inspirations.Billy Martin does good backup vocals,while Benji and Joel Madden hit the notes perfectly.This cd is bright and poppy, just like their name.The reason why I give it three stars is because the lyrics are just too simple!But their still good and so is the beat."
1,They suck!!!!!!!!!,"If you think this band is good what the hell? Can't you do anything better with your time than listen to the biggest wan't to be's out there. This CD is horrible as are all there CDs. Let me leave you with these words, They suck,They suck, They suck."
5,Hahaha,"This is from the review below:""First thing I think of when I hear their name is ""what the hell?""Do you guys not recognize posers when you see them,what's the deal?I mean come on this album is for you little posers that don't know the difference between punk and poser punk.""Hahaha! Do you really think we care if their ""posers"" or w/e? This is good music and no labels, clothing or trends can change that."
3,Before it went downhill,"Growing up in Maryland and being that my wife's sister went to high school with members of Good Charlotte, I was interested in hearing this CD. Though it's not bad, it's your typical light weight punk CD. Some standout tracks are ""Little Things"" and ""Festival Song"". One wonders if the second was written about the HFS-tival.From hearing the songs from anything after this CD, it sounds like Good Charlotte cared more about the image than the music. And to call themselves ""DC's Finest"" is an insult. I wonder what Fugazi and Bad Brains would have to say about that!!Bottom line: If you're looking for the lesser of the evils of Good Charlotte music, pick this one up. It's not bad, but I would buy it used if I were you."
2,Somewhat lackluster..the better stuff is yet to come,"This is a fairly by the numbers uninspired pop-punk album. The hooks are OK but not a whole lot really digs in. Usual topics are alienation/girlfriend trouble...the usual ""emo"" trip. But the problem is the songs aren't as good as some of their similarly styled brethren.HIGHLIGHTS:Best cuts here are ""I Don't Wanna Stop"",""I Heard You"" and ""The Click"".BOTTOM LINE:You'll only need this if you're a diehard Good Charlotte fan. Otherwise, look to later albums for better material from this Maryland band."
1,total crap,"this album-and the band for that matter-totally sucks. They are just pop-punk-POSERS. i actually dont mind pop-punk like Sum 41 or Green Day, but dont ever even try to put a band like Good Charlotte anywhere NEAR the same genre as Black Flag or the Descendents. These guys should be banned from making music."
1,This is a JOKE! This is Definitely NOT PUNK,"What the hell is this. This is not punk, its just a bunch of pretty boys singing teeny pop music who can barely play their instruments. A terrible CD."
4,Only good Good Charlotte album,"This is the album that made me discover Good Charlotte 4 years ago. This is a good album if you just listen to it for fun and don't care about the lyrics or the music complexity. Good Charlotte has become boring with the album ""The Young and the Hopeless"" and is probably be more boring on the upcoming album in 2004. Well at least we can say Good Charlotte has once been not that bad. :P"
2,"catchy music, not punk","Good Charlette has some good tunes but they are not punk by any stretch of the imagination. My favorite song is 'Waldorf Worldwide'. The bottom line is these guys are not punk, they're just a christian rock band."
4,not that bad.,"I'd have to say.. even though I do feel that my musical tastes.. have matured.. greatly since the days Good Charlotte still had ""some"" street credibility amongst ""punk"" rock, that this album really isn't that bad.And I say that, because this is how I see it:First off, ""punk"" isn't dead, it just... has changed.. drastically since its hey-day and its ideals.. are not the same ideals it once had.Second, I wouldn't classify Good Charlotte, or any of those bands out there similar to Good Charlotte as ""punk."" Being that in the event that they did infact stay true to the ideals of true ""punk"" rock, this would be a very different album.And lastly, don't rate this album if you're going to go and try and resurrect Sid Vicious with your fake leather arm bands and the ""studded-by-none-other-than-myself"" jackets. You people who treat style over substance really should be checked tumors on a regular basis, or should just check your age and sources for opinions. I'd pay to see you last a day in 1977."
5,A CD everyone must own,"This CD is definitely one of the best albums I own. I have an eclectic taste in music, but GC is by far my favorite band. I have been a fan for over 2 years, and the CD doesnt get old. Their music is inspirational, and at the same time really good to listen to."
4,Good Charlotte deliver a good time.,"The debut album from rockers Good Charlotte is just a good time. With tracks like ""Little Things"" and ""Motivation Proclomation"", Good Charlotte will keep listeners pushing rewind for hours."
1,lame,"my friend said to review the things i hate, so i would just like to say that people who liked this cd also liked hilary duff. punk? no. good? no. Crap? yes."
1,B!+che5,"No-talent posers that sound so whimpy and watered down. Yeah, they like to dress like they're ""soooooo cool and bad"" (lol!), but their music is no different than any lame @55 Nsync or BSB album. Don't worry, GC will be tossed aside in a year or so, just like all the other trendy fads. ""The Young And The Hopeless"" is what their loser fans are. Morons. 5h!+ like this never lasts, thank Christ."
1,corporate manufactured poseur punk,"Good Charlotte is NOT punk. I don't care if you heard they were on TRL, Good Charlotte represents everything punk is suppose to be against. This album is nothing more than unoriginal garbage produced to make some record label money. If you want to hear what real punk sounds like try listening to Rancid, NOFX, Dead Kennedys, or Minor Threat. Even if you think Good Charlotte is the greatest band ever and you hate me because I have a different opinion than you do, at least download a couple mp3s from the bands I suggested. You don't know what you don't like unless you try it(and yes, I have heard Good Charlotte's album.)"
2,a hell of a lot better than the 2nd one,"not punk, and not very good, but gc before they went mainstream is MUCH better than the young and the hopeless. i'm hoping their 3rd cd is not so pop...i just hate to see bands like green day that get more and more pop with every cd!!!pennywise is 1000000000000000000000% better!!!!!!!"
2,Trite and Stupidly Self-Conscious,"Good Charlotte's major single, ""Little Things"" is characteristic of the rest of the album. Self-conscious lyrics that are pointless and poorly written. Bands like this fall by the wayside faster than their songs can be played on the radio."
5,Finally a cd I can relate to!,"This is one of the best cds that I own! I feel like the guys of GC were writing it straight out of my thoughts at times, it was uncanny how much better these songs made me feel! Finally, I can totally get into a band!"
2,A valiant debut that falls short,"The more recent Good Charlotte fans are probably not aware that this album even exists, even so, they are not missing much. It doesn't take a skilled musician to know that there is nothing special offered by this album. Nonetheless, the CD does have it's infectious, stand out tracks like ""Waldorf Worldwide"" and ""Little Things."" It seems pretty obvious by now that Good Charlotte and other bands following in its tracks are just making up the next generation of boy bands, only with a slight difference. If you genuinely like Good Charlotte's ""The Young and the Hopeless,"" you should check this CD out. Otherwise, stay clear and listen to something with a little more substance."
5,This album ROCKS!!,"I sarted to listen to C.D.s and the good charlotte self-titled album was the first c.d. I bought.My favorite songs are eastcoast anthem,complcated,little things,thank you mom which is the hidden track and that song totally touched my heart and it reminds me of that I love my mother.That album totally rocks and it's one of my favorite rock albums."
5,"A great, under-rated cd.....","Other people here a rated this cd pretty low, but i have got to disagree with them.This is an awesome cd. I am usually in to heavier music than this, but this cd was still very appealing to my taste.This is one of those albums that can be enjoyed from the first song to the very last instead of only having a few good singles.I give all the songs at the very least 8/10.I would give a list of my favorites, but then I would be naming pretty much every song on the album. Most of the songs are very catchy, and it also has a few really good slow songs. I defintly think anyone even slightly interested in pop punk would really like this album."
1,"Not Punk, Not Good","Their fashion consultants must have seen some old photos of Discharge and thought 'Wow, lets use these fashions to sell gutless music to clueless mallrats'. Ever feel like you've been conned? If you want real punk, well, needless to say, you're in the wrong place. Hell, if you want real POP-punk you can do MUCH better than this. Try using your brain and search out records by the Buzzcocks, Undertones, Husker Du, Vibrators, Boys, Adicts, Wire and Mission of Burma instead."
5,Great cd!,"Hey, Holden McNiel dude... STOP GOING TO GOOD CHARLOTTE CDS AND RATING THEM IF YOU HATE THEM!!!!Anyway... This cd is great! Good Charlotte is a great rock band. I wouldn't call them 'punk', but they never said they were punk! Anyway, back to the cd. If you want the original cd cover, buy it here, not at the store. They don't sell the original cover in the store. I wish I bought mine here... Their cd, The Young And The Hopeless is great too."
4,good charlotte,"this cd is ok i guess. I have to say that ""Little things"",""Motivation proclamation"", and ""The Festival song"" are the best songs on the cd. The young and the hopeless cd is better."
4,better than some,"i've found that this cd is the one i listen 2 if i'm looking 4 light,happy go lucky music.good charlotte were the band who introduced me to a taste of punk.There is punk spirit on this album but not much punk music.most of it is just fun stuff 2 listen 2 when u can't b bothered 2 listen 2 hard stuff.gc have been labelled as sell outs which i think is partially tru given their liking for mtv.having said that if they ditched mtv then they would totally thrash all the rest of the pop punk bands out there at the moment (aka simple plan and NFG)"
5,It rocks!,"Good Charlotte's newest album is absolutly worth buying! The songs are deep and meaningful, but also funny in a way. I would never have thought that this music was eny good, but then I listend to it, and now I just can't stop...so buy it! If you like punk/rock, you won't be sorry!!"
3,good charlotte rocks,this is the best band and this cd is great but their second one is wayyyyyy better!
1,good charlotte isn't good anything,"Their manufactured look is tacky, their music is boring and redundant and their lyrics are simple and uninspired. If I want to be crushed by a throng of sweaty pre-pubescent girls and losers in studded bracelets I will go to a Good Charlotte concert. If I want to listen to some good, politically concious and original music I will put in a CD by The Dead Kennedy's, The Clash, Bad Religion, The Adicts or The Velvet Underground to name a few. I don't care if you listen to Good Charlotte, but be warned, listening to this CD will drastically lower your IQ level. And for God's sake don't turn around, put on a GC t-shirt and a studded belt and go around calling yourself a ""punk rawker"".If I could give this CD negative stars I would."
3,yep,"I don't mind them all to much..its all catchy and it doesn't hurt the ears..but to the person who said that they have impacted many lives?..that must be a joke..they are not deep..they are nothign.this is not deep music in one sense of it...when it comes down to it..this band is the ""punkish"" version of Eminem (and you only say ""punkish""..because its not rap and they dress all crazy..BUT>>this is a big but..this cd is great..better then any other there other things they have made..maybe its because i have listened to it before anyone knew their name..but i do believe it is the best music..so if you are here looking at this page..you might as well get it"
1,Good Charlotte,"First thing I think of when I hear their name is ""what the hell?""Do you guys not recognize posers when you see them,what's the deal?I mean come on this album is for you little posers that don't know the difference between punk and poser punk.The only reason I'm here writing this review is because someone gave it to me as a gift,I gave it a chance;I heard all of it.Still,this album sucks major and those of you who like it can stop clicking NO on the reviews that are correct. If I was able to rate this album with zero stars I would, unfortunately I can't because the minimum is one star. Oh,well...."
5,Good Punk,"Now heres a good new band. Good Charlotte comes to us with very cool songs and raplike lyrics that i like very much. Some of the songs are less punky but thats ok cuz they are still good. ""Little Things"" thier current single is good and is doing very well on the radio, another good song is ""Waldorfworldwide"" which is funny and expresses what almost every guy in the world wants ""I want a hot girl and a little bit of money"" i quote. some other good songs are ""Festival Song"", ""Walk By"", ""Let Me Go"", ""Screamer"", ""East Coast Anthem"", and ""Complicated."" The rest of the album is good too and i cant wait to see what these guys do next."
5,great,"I got this cd and expected it to be like one that you have to skip over some songs, but thats not how it is at all. i now love good charlotte and i love thier music... this cd is great for making you feel better and getting you pumped up."
5,GC rocks,After i got the Young and the Hopeless GC's second CD i had to go out and get their first. I was very happy with it. I liked all the songs and it was a good cd to just listen to and not have to worry about skipping songs since you don't like them. The songs are really chatchy and really good. I think that this is a great cd for pretty much anyone unless you don't really like pop and punk music
5,"Catchy, meaningful... what more could you want?!","Good Charlotte has been my favorite band for two years, and I also have their newer CD, the young and the hopeless. However, if you are trying to decide which CD to buy, 'the young and the hopeless' or 'good charlotte', I would definitely suggest this one. They've grown a lot since this came out, but it's still a classic. Every song on here could be an immediate hit. If you listen to ""pop-punk"" or ""punk"", definitely give this CD a try. This CD is a gem for people of all music interests, though. If it looks like Benji, Billy, Paul, and Joel have made a masterpiece with the young and the hopeless, well they made a miracle with this CD."
3,"good charlotte, okay, but not great","If you liked good charlottes later cd's, you might be dissapointed if you get this one. It is very different than the other ones. In other words, if you liked the young and the hopeless and the chronicals of life and death, and you want something similar, don't get this, you will be dissapointed."
1,Punk Rock? not likely,who would be stupid enough to call these guys a punk rock band. They suck!!!good charlotte sucks
1,OMG,"ok lets see........is this punk, i bet half of you out there r like hell yes. ever1 who thinks it is is a poser. this is not punk it is pop and crap."
3,"Good, but not very original","Good charlotte is a very average pop-punk band, nothing really special about them. This cd was kinda slow, the only songs i really liked were ""waldorf worldwide"" and ""little things"". But they sound kinda like a boy band with guitars. LFO?? Just download those 2 songs..."
2,Kinda...,"The thing is, this band has potential to be a great punk rock band, but they are doing a few things wrong.Some of these songs are just sillyness/stupidness. For example, in the song ""Little Things"", the melody and music is great, but the lyrics need help. Some of the lyrics sound like rap music (In the chorus, the singer quotes from a Nas song). Same thing in ""WaldorfWorldwide"".But there are positives. ""Motivation Proclimation"" is one of the best songs I've heard this year.I give this CD 2.5 stars (Amazon needs .5 ratings!). They have potential, but they got a long way to go to being a quality punk band (even though the mainstream should dig it)."
5,Rockin hot Good Charlotte,This album is hot![.] Its got to be one of their best yet. The lyrics are so rockin it will make you want to dance and sing along. Good Charlotte has the hottest members and lyrics. The songs are amazzzzzzzzzzing![.]You'll never want to turn this off.Its best when its lound. I highly highly highly highly recamend this. You will love it!... I sure do. I could go on all day about this but i'm sure you don't have time but please buy it.Truely your their biggest fan this is Benji n' Joels chick.
5,they rock,"this is one of the best CD's ever i got i back when i first came out and i have been listing too it ever since its is the best punk rock ever the lyrics are awsome and he beet is great it can really help to brightin up your day GC rocks and so does there music make sure to buy their new album ""THe YOUNg and THe RESt LESs""~scifipunk12"
5,sweet band,"The bottom line is that this is just the best punk Rock band out there. I'm about to buy there new CD in about 10 days, and I'm seeing them at the Kool Haus in Toronto on October 20."
5,GC ROCKS,I love GC and they rock and there cd kicks....they rock and so dose there music!! they are teh nicest guys and they care about there fans!! no they are not punk...but what is punk?? all know is that they are doing what they love and making poeple like so happy tlistening to them!! i think they rock and if you are looking for a good cd you have found one!! i have also herd stuff from there new ablum and it is so good it is more punk...if thats what you are saying there not!! im not saying its like PUNK but its more punk then there old cd!! it is good to so you could pre-order that one to if you want...PeaceKyla!
3,More like 2.5,"This cd is okay at best. There were a couple good songs but all of them were nothing I haven't heard before. This cd is pure pop punk and heavy on the pop. They seem to be trying too hard to be mainstream. Normally being mainstream is not so bad, but when you are trying to tailor your music to a general audience instead of writing music that speaks to you, you end up losing alot of the emotion and originality. This is what happened with this cd. If you are just a general fan of pop punk music like Blink 182 or Sum 41 you may enjoy this cd but not hardcore punk or emo fan."
5,Good Charlotte Rawks,"This c.d. to sum it up quickly is awsome! The riffs, the rythms and everything overall just rocks! Benji's hair is the coolest. My friend S.L. told me about this and said it was awsome, so I tried it and was totally into it,the hidden song is cool too. BUY THIS CD!"
2,good charlotte.. it's.. okay.,"Good Charlotte is a band with a lot of potential. Good instrumentation, great harmonies, etc. But there's one thing that they're lacking heavily. Lyrical skills. Pretty much every song on the group's self-titled debut are catchy, however, the lyrics are way too mediocre and sound like they could be written by a 13-year-old. This isn't a dis on the band. The album is a good album, but there are a lot of areas the band could improve on. But that's what the sophomore effort is for."
4,Good Charlotte,"I have only heard there song 'Motivation Proclamation' but it is a good song, and I want to get the cd soon."
2,Gimme A Break,"Good Charlotte is a perfect example of the kind of boy band manufactored crap that is flooding music these days. Yes, they have catchy tunes on here and ive definately heard worse music than this, but overall Good Charlotte is lacking creativity and just sound very fake. You get the feeling that these guys should spend less time tyring to look cool and more time actually making good music"
4,great cd!,"This is a great example of good punk rawk! I also recommend Green Day, Blink-182, Less Than Jake, The Offspring, Sublime, MxPx, EvE6, Lit, and No Doubt. When i first heard ""Little Things"" on the radio, i loved them. Whenever that song came on i recorded it or listend to it! I knew i had to get the CD. So I got it. The beggining songs are the best. The songs kinda get boring at the end, but they're still good and i gotta say ""I looooooove this cd!!!"""
5,comparing,"...[Awsome]...cd and a great band behind it , the best way to describe good charlotte is to put together Mark from Blink 182 and then some Sugarcult and a little New Found Glory and you have the perfect band = Good Charlotte like manny others might have said i have hooked all my friends on to GC and i cant stop listening to them"
4,Good but not great,"This cd is good but not great, the extra tracks are ok, and the songs all together get boring and old. Yet the songs are good when you first listen to it. But I wouldn't recommend it. Thats why I gave it 4 stars. It is also sort-of poppy."
4,"pretty good, lots of potential","good charlotte. the name says it all. GOOD. yes, this is a good CD. Little Things is good, so is Festival Song and I Don't Wanna Stop. It's a little bit lighter punk, with no swear words(gasp)! It't nice to know a band can make awesome music, and not swear."
1,yo man diz cd is whack yo,"yo check diz out yo diz cd aint cool yo , all diz peeps do iz claimin 2 b punc yo. Ok enough of that garbage ( that was really my mocking of these reviewer's slang lingo). Well it seems the trendy mall generation has yet churned out another poser wannabe pop band with a urge to be punk. This album represents everything that makes me doubt my lifestyle day by day. Just hearing the song ""The Little Things"" makes me vomit allover myself , but then I put in a Blitz cd and i'm all better. It's a shame todays youth will never learn what true punk is with bands like this desecrating the name of our beloved culture. Avoid at all cost"
1,Good Charlotte is sickophantic,"I can not believe this band has a record contract. ""Little Things"" has no dimension to it, its repetitive, and just plain sick. This cookie cutter stuff coming out of all places, Waldorf, MD, (no surprise) is completely sickophantic and a waste of air time for all. If I could give negative 5 stars, I would."
2,No Big Deal,"To be honest, I don't know what the big deal is. These guys were horrible 3 years ago, and they're even worse now. The only reason they get any attention at all is because they're from Maryland. In fact the only reason I even gave it two stars was because I needed a lower rating to give to Creed."
1,There should be one bad review up here,"Oh my god, if I could rate thing 0 stars I would. GC has terrible and uninspired lyrics. They're say they are punk but like Avril Levine they are just sellouts and sing crappy pop songs for the pre-pubescant girls. If you do not immediately hate them like I did, you will hate them more over time (like I did). I scoff at that kid with the spiked hair, when I go to school, some people say ""going for the gc thing?"" Then I punch them, because I hate GC and I'd rather proove that Leftover Crack, Casualties, Beastie Boys, Dead Kennedys, Rise Against, and Toxic Narcotics is better and more hardcore. TooL and Frank Zappa should come kick their spoiled hineys and show them how to play music... then kill them, I need that oxygen more than they do."
1,why?,"I am not goin to conplain like so many gc haters, but common.This stuff should not be listenend too. Its pop that is labold punk. I used to like this junk so I understand u fans, but when you take the Ramones or other great punk bands and compare it to this you have crap. Please for the love of punk do not buy this album."
2,THis is supposed to be punk rock,"I am 19 and i heard about a pop punk band called GC...i do like pop punk....i like the queers , i like screeching weasel,i like Nofx.....i heard tons of bad stuff about them from freinds but i said ""screw what the punk community thinks of them,ill take a listen for myself"".........waste of money....the music is pure pop, and the lyrics are juvenile....no to mention selfish....all they do is whine aobut thier lives...most punk bands have 1 or 2 songs like that...there is like 7 of them on this cd......ussauuly punk puts me in a frenzy...this puts me to sleep"
2,hot topic like crazy,"the music has some talent, but it gets annoying ...to hear them talk about how punk they are, they aren't punk, and whoever about said punk is about how much u spend at hot topic, you full of it, punks not dead, real punk is still alive ... but if u like pop, buy the cd, if you a real punk, avoid this band completly"
2,Catchy but could be better,This cd was pretty cool except it kind of [was bad] if you do not like soft music dont buy it!
5,Good Charlotte Punk Rawkrs Listin up.......,"Good Charlotte iz the most kik booty band ther evr wuz. If u ain't evr herd of them, [....] Well, this iz the greatest CD u could evr buy so ask somebody to take u 2 the local mall 2 git it! Joel iz the most bootylicious, sexy, talented, lucious.........need I say more? The other guys aren't to bad on the eyes either... Their talent iz the most amazing thing there evr wuz.Twin brothers Benji and Joel(who refuse using their last names, so don't even bother trying to figure it out!) Wrote all of the songs, with the help on a couple... Well I try to influence u...... Just go git the CD and see what I'm talking about. By the way, there iz 14 songs,plus the sweetest song that u could evr hear dedicated 2 they're mommas....go buy the CD and find out. ""Represent GC 'cuz u know they be representin u"", and remember,""We are the lifeblood of GC."""
3,Good Charlotte isn't punk.... but still cool,"I've read some of these reviews, and Good Charlotte isn't really punk. They're more pop. I mean, some of their songs, like I heard you is really good, but most of them are pop. Oh well, this cd's really good. I got to catch them live, and the concert was really good. I suggest seeing one of their concerts if you live in Maryland. They even signed my cd, Benji is so hot! Vote for ""little things"" on TRL."
1,A nice mix between Nick Carter and Punk Rock Barbie....,"Entirely poserish baloney....it entirely obvious that theyre just writing on some punk themes they heard without actually knowing what the hell they were talking about...and did you read the little stuff in the cover art booklet? they were like talking about how they thanked jesus and there ""wonderful parents""...real anarchist...and you know like half the songs are about how their parent suck...im sorry but this was the gayest most preppy thing since,dare i say it....nick carter........this is not real punk like greenday and AFI, this is poppy poserish...sound like something off of a christian radio station....seriously....if gc is super good, then real bands are super super super....(9000000000000000000000 times later) good."
1,No use for a title,"I want to listen to punk music here you have a few bands to listen to: rufio, no use for a name, lagwagon, strung out, bad religion, satanic surfers, pulley, rise against, strike anywhere, no motive, samiam. i could go on...and basically i don't care about cg but i'm putting this comment so all those people who believe cg is punk get a real image of that punk really is. in other words cg is cg, but not punk hmm kay?"
2,GC? Really?,"After reading several reviews on this Cd, and having owned The Chronicles of Life and Death and Good Morning Revival and loved those 2 Cds, I decided to download a few songs from this one...Don't bother with it. The songs are basically all the same, and unlike their later CDs, the lyrics are stupid and not that interesting. It just sounds like a bad teen age band Cd.I liked East Coast Anthem and Walk By, and that was about it..."
2,"okay cd, if you dont get bored easily.","This is a okay cd. But the band live is way better. All the songs are good, but the ""first single,"" ""Little Things"" gets old after awhile and ""Walk By"" isnt one of the best songs. Anyways, this cd is bad so dont buy it. and also the twins are ugly."
1,Lombardi's Legacy Demands A Bigger Book,"I really like Mark Lombardi's artwork, but buyer beware--the dimensions of this book are a mere 11 x 9.2 x 0.4 inches. Mr. Lombardi's work is relatively large by comparison. For this book, his pieces have been shrunk to where it is almost impossible to read what's been written in the nodes of the networks. Each featured piece is instead explained by the authors, with the occasional enlargement of a section for clarification. This seems contrary to the spirit of Mr. Lombardi's work. I was expecting this book to at least have fold-out pages, but no such luck. The artwork is completely subordinate to the authors' verbose text. So if you want to READ about Mark Lombardi and his work, and get a little information design history lesson in too, then this book will do just fine. But if you want to actually LOOK at Mark Lombardi's artwork, look elsewhere. I think I will be reselling this book."
4,$9.99 gold box deal,"The only thing that could have made this better is if it had been a v-neck. This is a nice ""beefy"" tee similiar to the ones that get handed out with corporate logos on them but this one the gift recipient will actually want to wear outside of the house."
3,A fine B-movie,This is fine b-movie. It has a real annoying women character and a journalist that wont take no for an answer. Reccomended to anyone who loves b-movies
2,CREATURE OF THE BLACK LAGOON : THE COME BACK,"As I like watching sci-fi movies once in a while, I rented SYNGENOR with no special prejudices in mind. Director George Elanjian Jr.'s filmography includes a few TV shows and two volumes of Playboy Video Magazine. It could be worse, after all. Well, I must admit that I watched SYNGENOR until its end only because of the performance of David Gale who plays a drug addicted director becoming completely insane during the course of the movie. He's really very funny in this role.The rest of the movie is not so funny mainly because of the editing; it seems that important scenes have been cut or simply not shot by the director. The syngenors are absolutely ridiculous, lacking the zest of humanity that can transform a monster in a creature worthy of staying in the memory of the movie lover. Too bad.A DVD zone dusty shelves."
3,June 2012 F101 Voodoo article.,"I have been a Flight Journal subscriber for many years so I was very disappointed with the Voodoo article. There are so many inaccurate statements that it makes me wonder if the person interviewed actually flew an F101. I sent an e mail to the magazine web site outlining some of the mistakes but no reply was received. I also provided a copy of a page from my Air Force flight records that document the fact that I flew the Voodoo as a pilot in 1959 and 1960.I also provided the much the same imput on the magazine web site as a response about the article. It also never saw the ""light of day"". One can only wonder about the overall accuracy of any of the articles in the magazine. I will not be renewing my subscription this year."
1,Where are my issues...?,"I subscribed on Mar 3, 2006. It said 6 issues/12 months. Over a year has passed. I received 2 issues. Where are the other four?"
5,excellant,The product was delivered on the day promised in the condition it was supposed to be. Thank you for the excellant service. kh
4,great,Item arrived on time and contained all required pieces. Form fit and finish seem good. Have not had an oportunity to use it yet.
1,Never got it.,I ordered this product for Christmas. Never received any notification that it was shipped. Never got the product. I'll be checking my January CC statement for charges then notify the bank.
3,"good product, came in bad shape","I ordered this for A Christmas gift, the bottle came in tact but the box was terribly bent up and dented in! I am very disappointing with this! It was packaged well which means the box looked like that when they packed it to ship it. I wouldn't personally mind if it was for me, but who wants to receive a gift that looks like it's been beat up. This is my first bad review with amazon, and I don't like to leave it, but I am very disappointed!!!"
2,Not the best choice,"Unfortunately this product looks as cheap as it is when on your hands. It's just pretty in the picture. I received the bumblebee with broken antennae, probably due to bad handling, but little ironic anyway, don't you think? There are details that do not appear in the reference image such as the elastic band on the back or the hole in the chest, not good looking at all I must say. I would recommend getting something more expensive, maybe disney stuff, or anything you have already seen for real. Beware for similar products"
2,They just don't make them like they used to,"Cons:*unless you pick the dozer up to turn it, the tracks fall off*lots of plastic parts*wear parts are plastic, not metalPros:*my son is required to fix this toy when the tracks come off, which provides some educational value*bought locally for <$14, which seems like a fair price for this toyBottom line:Don't expect the same construction of the classic all-steel Tonkas."
5,Smiles galore!!,"We got this toy for our 3 year old grandson...I was kind of surprised the track and blade was plastic, but this way he can play with it indoors. Seems very secure...we have always loved the Tonka brand. I would recommend it"
5,Tonka Trucks,My boys played with the Tonka trucks constantly when they were small. Now their kids are small and they are enjoying the newer generation of the trucks and toys. When my boys were young they were all metal. We will see how the hard plastic stands up with a new generation of kids.
2,Not satisfied,Purchased this for a Christmas present. I was not pleased at all....the size was very small and to me was not worth what I paid for. I didn't want to go through the trouble of having to pay to send it back so I just kept it.
2,Not Satisfied,Very disappointed in this item....way to small for the price....I kept it....did not want the hassle of mailing it back.
2,Thought it would be a great toy for grandson,"I thought this would be a great toy for our 3 year old grandson. As Iwatched him trying to play with it, I was wishing I had gotten something else. If you want a push type toy, this isn't one for that. He's still into running and pushing bigger vehicles. This one isn't tall enough.Then he tried moving the blade up and down and that proved to be ratherhard and doesn't move much when it does move. Later we took it to thepark so he could play in the sand with it. The rubber tracks keptcoming off. He finally got so frustrated with that, he went to play withsomething else. I kept thinking about how much I had paid for this toythat had turned into such a disappointing experience for him and myself.If I had know about these things before I purchased it, I would have gone with something else."
3,Fun,"This game is fun.. all the Sims games are fun.. But, the more games you get, the slower the game goes. When i first downloaded it and started playing it there were like 20 of the same person (he was cloned!! lol)... this happened when i tried to scroll and the man who was on the corner of the screen just mulitiplied.. but then they all disappeared except the one man. Soon, i deleted a lot of files so it runs faster. Overall, though, this game is okay. You don't really get to do a lot with the animals though. Just spank them when they pee on your ground......For the best Sims Game stick with Hot Date!"
5,Sounds Great!,Lots of people are looking foward to this expansion pack! It sounds like tons of fun to have pets for your sims! And you can grow a garden and sell the foods you grow at farmers market! You can train your pets or hire someone else to do it for you! This sounds like the best thing since Hot Date!
5,More and interesting,"Hi, I agree with everyone that has written something for the sims unleased. Mostly also agree with Terre Haute. They really should have another sims dealing with what Terre said. I also can not wait till it comes out. Some people say that its a waste of money but i dont think so."
3,almost like the original,"I have not had the chance to play all the expansion packs however I have to say that it isnt as great as I thought. The game, to me, is almost like the original exept you have pets and can go outside of your home. I was hopeing that it would be more interesting but it isnt. If you ask me I would choose one of the other expansion packs. Im hopeing to get the others for Christmas, ;-) right mom!?! Anyway I would choose one of the other expansion packs but if your a collector of the games then I would buy it just so you have it in your collection."
4,"Very fun, but...","This new ""Sims"" game is very interesting. It has alot alot of new things. The thing that I less liked is that there are SO many things to learn!!! ( Maybe its a good point!!) You need to get used to the bigger lots, and the new animals that are added.The pets are very cute, but i dont understand - Why cant you control the animals acting??I recimend this game very much!!"
4,if you love animals u will love this game!,"well i got the double deluxe game a year ago and i got bored with it, but this one is more fun but to be honest save the money for the sims 2 it's 10 times better than the original!"
4,Amazing,"Pets! You can get lots and lots of pets. that was the first bounus feature I ever saw for this game. I started playing the sims when I was about 7. I am suprised that they made it this far! Anyway... My first reaction was WOW! My first family on this was mine, of course. I had 4 kids, Me, My husband, and our 2 pets. After getting the hang of pets I made my family again with me and 2 cats. By the end of 6 regualar days I had a total of 6 cats!It is amazing what this game has in store!"
4,"Nice Game, great graphics, but a little slow","I really love and adore this game. It is one of my mostprized possesions. It is a really fun game . If you've playedthe other sim games then you'll have alot of fun, but it has itsdown sides. If you are not a patient person I would notrecomend this game for you. It takes awhile to get to thenieghborhood screen, and it is extremely slow in Old Town.It also has a tendentcy to freeze, while your playing, andsometimes when you move the cursor over a certain houseit automatically quits. Other then that it is a great game."
3,Not all that great.....But still good,"I have to admit, Unleased was'nt as entertaining as other expansions. The problems far outweigh the new features. Stray pets are a major peoblem in my opinion, There is no way to keep them out (even though i tried to make a pound once) and they seriously decrease the room factor outside of your home when they ""do their business"" usually behind your house or at the edge of the screen where you cant see it. The crops are also a problem, You may spend days growing plant, only to get get a few simoleons in return. And my final arguement with unleashed is that you have almost no control over your pets, almost defeating the purpose of having them. But dont get me wrong, The Super-enlarged neighboorhoods and old town are great adititions the new items and skins are also great. So if you're looking for a full Sims experience, dont pass up Unleasehed."
3,It was fun- until I tried to re-install it,"I loved this expansion pack, but when I unsuccessfully tried to install the Sims Mega Deluxe after uninstalling this (you have to install the expansion packs in a certain order), it simply won't re-install. It's been driving me mad, I'm getting very frustrated with it...and I wish that it would work already, because this is a great game and I know I'm missing out on it. :("
2,It's okay...,"When I first purchased this game I thought it would be more than it really was. First the good things, while it's obvious that you get pets you will soon get tired of feeding Fido. Some of the new objects are pretty cool, but most aren't. I thought that the load time takes too long!I would not recommend this game at all! Don't waste your money on it!!(..)"
5,Sweet!,"I love this game! It is exactly what I have been wanting! Pets, Old Town, new careers, it has it all!"
4,wonderful game,"Untill this year I had never played the sims game,I bought it thinking oh its just another game that I will play and get tired of, NOT, this game is so great I spend hours playing it, I love building houses, evicting the families, creating families, buying items for the house,and being able to leave the house to explore new relationships etc. I can't wait untill I purchase the sims makin magic. My neighbor teased me about playing this game so much, that I decided to let her play, guess what she is now a sims fan. The thing I do hate are the bugs that I have to spray all the time."
4,Very cute!!!,"This is the best Sims expansion yet, as far as gameplay goes.The little animals are adorable!! I just wish I had more time to play, because I would like to see what kind of tricks they can do.HOWEVER, there are some serious bugs in the game, that the patch did not fix.1.People spin around several times before doing anything. This is not only annoying, but it wastes their time.2.The women now have a ""gorrilla walk"" which is ugly and annoying.3.MOST IMPORTANTLY, the game often locks up after an hour or so. The patch helps this sometimes, but not all the time.But, aside from those issues, this is a great addition to the game!"
2,Pets?,"The strays really get annoying, running around the house. The objects are cool, but dont add much. Sometimes the game would freeze and I'd have to restart the game. I'll stick with the reguaLar Sims."
4,SOLiD,"this is a solid expansion pack. it does what it claims to do, lots of new pets, and new careers. but one of the things i like best about sims are the skins/heads, and this expansion pack doesn't give you much of either one (heads more than skins).it takes a long time for your pet to be well-trained & learn skills, so be prepared for the wait. the new neighborhood is okay, but a little boring (cafe's, parks, etc), they help you meet new friends, but i would suggest downloading an object that makes friends for you (i have a painting, and when the sim looks at it, it's automatically friends with everyone in the neighborhood).but the sims UNLEASHED is a solid expansion pack with more lots to build houses on (another benefit) and pets. the only problem with pets is that they take up spots in the family, so pets + people combined can only be 8, which is a downfall."
4,Its way fun,"I think the sims unleashed is really cool it has some really cool things like going to ""old town"" and going to the petshop to pick out the pet you would like to have there is a variety of pets you can get a dog (there are lots of different colors to pick from), a cat (there are also alot of colors you can pick from), and iguana, a turtle, birds like love birds parets cokatoos and some more, you can also get fish there are lots of suplies you can get for your pets too. But getting pets can also be a pain to take care of but they are still good. Going to the parks can be fun too to meet new friends. In the end I would definatly recomend sims unleashed as a fun game. :)"
3,Pretty good!,"This was game, was slightly dissapointing, it was good to start with, but I quickly became bored, the objects were very limited, and I felt the game was finished in a hurry, however, it is a sims game so I dare say that the game is bad. Bacause Sims will always Sims and I like them!"
4,Can't Wait,"I can't wait for this expansion to come out. But even though I am looking foward to it, I am also wondering when this will end. I have purchased all of the expansion packs now and I think the only thing they can do with it now is make the people actually get older. I think this should be the last expansion pack and I hope it ends with a bang!"
2,not ANOTHER one!,"...Many of these things is Maxis going to pump out before they realize they need to make a NEW game??? After the end of time, maybe they'll come up with the brilliant idea of making A REAL SEQUEL! WOW! Who would have though Maxis would do that, I mean, after all, they only made FIVE expansions for ONE game. I can't belive they would do this again. The game still has the...sims themselves, the over priced trash cans, 1995 quality graphics, laggy gameplay, and let's not forget the fact that Maxis has been ripping off people like this(30 bucks for one expansion) since 1998. I think I'll ilegally burn a copy and then return it, thanks. >:) Kudos for Maxis, though, for mangaging to ruin a good game with so many darn expansions while still racking in the $$."
3,doesn't look good,"I'm a big fan of the sims but I think it's a waste to have a new expansion for the game when Sims 2 might be out in a year or so.also with all the previous expansion this one will only help slow the game down.with all it's popularity the Sims does have ALOT of bugs and has caused alot of problems because of the increasing number of expansions that followed it, the Sims Unleashed looks like it will only add a few more..."
1,This is crazy,"Has no one ever considered the folly of living your life through a computer generated character? Adventures and action are one thing, but when it comes to living everyday life on the computer, you need to begin questioning your priorites. Does this remind anyone of the matrix?"
3,Probably the worst of the expansion packs,"Don't get me wrong! I love the Sims! It's probably my favorite PC game of all time. I just personally felt that this expansion pack just added the pet aspect, but it was hard to control both your Sims needs and your Pets needs. I bought it, and tried it out, but ultimately I went back to the previous pack. With the Sims 2 due out this year, it's pretty much a waste to pick this up so late in the game. You would do better to just wait and get the new Sims."
4,game as promise,Game as promised. On time and in condition as stated. Thank you for timely mailing and item as stated. Grandson is enjoying playing this very much.
4,The Sims Unleashed - yeah!,"I don't personally have this game, but my best friend does. We both have The Sims, and I have Vacation. My friend is totally and completely obsessed with animals, so when TSU came out, she almost instantly called me. I liked the game too, and she got it the day after it came out as a late birthday present (her birthday was Sept. 20th, and it came out the 23rd!). Now she always plays it!The game is so much fun! You can have pets (obviously), gardens, go down town, and there's now thirty neighborhood lots! One dissapointing thing is that you can't control your pets. You can tell if your dog or cat wants to go to the bathroom, but you can't send them to a fire hydrant or a litter box. This game is still number one on my Christmas List, but keep that one aspect in mind when you buy the game."
3,"Crashes, but worth it for pets?","Having felt my Sims' lives were missing the joy of a little bundle of fur for a long time, I feel particularly fond of this pack. Buying puppies and kittens is a lot of fun. However, this game has more problems than is actually worth the buy, problems which Maxis refuses to put out patches to fix. Among them are flooding under objects, memory leaks that cause the game to crash to the desktop, and a quirk that causes Sims to lose energy when they visit the new Old Town. Old Town, in fact, is not very interesting at all, given that your Sims will lose energy so rapidly while there. It is like another downtown except that your whole family can visit. In addition, expect stray animals to prowl your Sims lawns and houses and leave their marks behind. Gardening was a fun addition though. So I rate this pack exactly half. The good and the bad balance out pretty evenly, but if you can't handle some serious game problems in order to have gardening and pets, don't buy it."
4,CUTEST SIMS EVER !,"Like, this game is not only soooooox a million fun !!! but, has great graphics(of course!), very good, has adorable new features !!!All, the little pets u get to choose from... it's so adorable, how they follow you around and u get toys and etc.I totally reccomend it for anybody !!!"
1,Too many expansion packs!,"The first two or three Sims games were AMAZING. I totally loved them, playing until all hours of the night. But when they started releasing all these new expansion packs, and I got each one as it came out, my computer had some digestion problems, so to speak. Now, it takes about fifteen minutes to load the game, and at least twenty to go to Vacation Island, Old Town, etc. When I'm in any of those places, my Sims move jerkily, and the screen jumps around. If I try to scroll too fast, the game either crashes or goes in slow motion. It takes my Sims at least three game hours to do anything, so I have to wake them up at 12 midnight if I hope to get them to school. All in all, I'd say to stay small and avoid all these fancy expansion packs! The pets aren't that great, and you could grow vegetables with downloads already!"
5,nothing beats the sims unleashed,"hi i'm ormie a sim fan. i think that the sims unleashed is wicked. you can buy, train, and play with pets and there is more and more jobs for your sims. but if you don't like to clart on with gardening you can grow them instead i love it its easy relaxing and you can logg onto the sims.com and learn how to make family albums so buy it if you haven't and i can't wait till a new one comes outby paul o a sim fan************"
1,Horrible Bugs & Crashes,"The game just came out and like many other buyers I went out and bought it! BIG MISTAKE!!I have found that I am not the only victim of Maxis that many others have experienced the wonderful side affects of putting a game out before it is ready to be out! The first time I tried to install the game it crashed and I got an error message. The second, the third and the fourth time it just crashed. I get sent back out to the desktop every time. Don't bother asking for support or help with your game from the technical support people because they are just plain unhelpful! I really suggest people just wait till they put a patch out because otherwise it will be a frustrating time of reinstalling, deleting and starting from scratch to correct problems only a patch can really fix!"
3,Don't waste your money,I have this and I was totally disappointed! The price is rediculous for the little bit of game it offers. You almost can't have more then one pet because if you do one will eventually die or something because you can't keep up with it! I was just discusted!! And it really stinks that you can't take them back after you open them!
5,Super Cool,Great game!!! :)*Awesome walls/floors/windows/doors*Adorable pets*Great jobs*Downtown is really cool*Loads and loads and loads of stuff to doA definate 'must-get'Well worth the money- Reveiw by Sasha and her friends
4,"Good, But Not Great","The Sims Unleashed offers a new addition to Sim life, pets. You can choose between Dogs, Cats, Goldfish, Iguanas, Turtles, and Birds. Althought this expantion pack offered pets, gardening, bigger neighborhoods, and community lots, it lacked many new objects, had the same old gameplay and graphics, and is unstable and freezes a lot. Overall it's a good game and I would recommend it."
4,Here Boy,The Sims is totally awsome but when they get to have pets like cats and dogs I knew the game would bark.So buy the game.I wonder if the pets can have babies?
5,I can't believe that it is finally pets!,"I can't believe that they have finally come out with PETS! I have been downloading them off of the internet, but thoes pets stink! All that they do is move along the screen,(but they call it walking) doing their business all over the place, your sims can play with them,(but they just kneel down, touch the animal, and stand back up), and you have to feel then ALL OF THE TIME! I LLLOOOOVVVVEEEE animals so this will be sweet! Thanks Maxis!"
4,Unleashed: Puppy Love,"The sims have pets- and it's about time! Hopefully, they'll make a Sims where you get cattle and horses- like Sims: On the Ranch- but until then- I'll be happy with this awesome game-and i'm sure you will be as well! It's time to fill up your sim's life with dogs and cats and more- and harvest your crops and have communities such as cafe's,markets and of course pet shops! Well, have a blast and discover a little something new in this new expansion!"
1,i wished i had something more,"i wished you could have put sim children with more interactions. like they start off as babyz then to toddlers, thensmall children then teenagers, then finally adulats. oh then old people.i want that."
3,No More...My Computers Going to EXPLODE!,950 MG!? Maxis says this game will take up 950 MG!? I only have ONE expansion pack on my computer and I only have 190 MG left!! ARGH! Have they not considered the fact that some people don't have computers with enough MG to weigh the same as a Sumo Wrestler!?
1,"The Sims, the scourge of gaming","The Sims was a bad idea to start off with and the fact that they have draged it on says something about the publishers and the people buying it. I buy this game, every single expansion pack and I hate them all! This game is so boring, so trite, so unimaginative. This game has all the makings of a very bad game."
4,Unleashed is Great!,"Unleashed is a great expansion pack. It offers pets, new jobs, new objects, walls, floors, and skins, and Old Town, which is like Downtown in Hot Date.Most of Unleashed is not pets. It focuses on new objects and new jobs, and Old Town. But the pets have all new toys, beds, food, and even a pet bath! You can also make a vegetable garden which will feed your sims instead of the fridge, or you can sell the vegetables in Old Town. There are also tons more houses and lots.I'm not saying Unleashed is perfect. It can cause your game to run slower, and there are not a whole lot of new objects. There's not much to do in Old Town, but Unleashed is still fun!"
5,GOIN' PET MAD!,"When I first played on Sims Unleashed I was quite shocked about how much fun it was.You get to choose from 5 types of pets such as Cats,Dogs,Birds,Turtles and Lizards.Also you get to take your Sims down town which includes Cafes,Parks,the market and the shops ,not just that, you can also CREATE THEM YOURSELF!Sims Unleashed is LOADS of FUN.IT'S THE MUST GET GAME OF THIS YEAR!"
5,GREAT!,"This game is great! I've always wanted a pet and with this I can sort of have one. Sometimes it freezes, but that's rare. It's my favorite out of all the Sims games!"
4,Very Fun But Could be Better,The Sims Unleashed is a great game. There are awesome pets and new skins (and heads). There are some flaws. I expected a little too much from it. Don't get me wrong it is a great game. You can win trophies in pet shows and train your pets to do tricks and housebreak them. There are many new selections. The thing I hate is it is harder to marry and make freinds (a lot harder). It still is a very fun game.If you need more fun for the sims it is this expansion pack.
2,Interesting,"In ""The Sims Unleashed"", as you probably already know, you get to have pets. I was very eager to get this game, and when I did, I was a little disapointed. Perhaps my expectations were too high. But anyway, your pet is just like a sim, except you cannot control it. And once you get it the only way to get rid of it is to kill it. Other than the pet items, there are not many new items that your sim can buy for his/her house. Though there are some new stairs, wallpapers, etc. I got tired of this game only after a week or so of buying it, so it was not worth the $... I paid for it."
5,BEST SIM EXPANSION PCK YET!!!!!,"This is the best sim expansion pck yet!! I already pre-ordered it. And i read all of the reviews. The game souds so cool. Although it needs 950 MB (MegaBites), still it sound awsome. I heard that there is 12 breeds of dogs, 12 breeds of cats, birds, turtles, love birds, monkeys, parrots, and giant parrots.Your sims can now visit the pet shop, park, farmer's market and other places. And there are 50 new careers, and 5 new career tracks. They are Teaching, Animal Care, Culinary (work with food), Fashion, and yes,that's right join the Circus!!"
3,What do you want to do with your sims?,"It depends on what you want to do with your sims as to whether you will like this expansion pack. There are new items which is great, new floors and walls. The garden factor is a little hard since animals immediately start tearing your garden to pieces and you have to buy a cat or two to get rid of the rabbits, then you get mice which the cats will sometimes hunt and sometimes not. I have preferred to not plant a garden - too much trouble.There are some new houses and more lots - this is a great feature of the expansion pack. Most of the animals are good, except they require lots of work on the part of your sim. If you have lazy sims like I like to have, this is an added responsibility."
4,pre existence doesn't prove a god,"Cause of us conceiving ourselves is not understood, but yes, children can appear before they conceive, to the living, not just birthing parents."
3,"Good, but why did he choose to use his own libraries?","The book is really well-structered and well-written. But it seems like it is absolutely useless if you try to learn C on your own. (I learnt it in class by the way, so it was quite helpful). I completely do not understand why the author had to ""simplify"" C with his own libraries. Are his students at Stanford incapable of learning real C?"
1,This Book Is Terrible,"If your teacher leaves much to be desired, do not turn to this book for help. Because the author uses his own libraries throughout the book, it is difficult to learn the real structure of a lengthy program. I found this book to be one of the most worthless books I have ever read."
1,A well written book with essential programs that don't work,I have to admit that I liked the book in the beginning. I thought it was well structured and clearly written. But my question is what is the use of a good book if you can not even run the programs because the extended libraries won't work as advertised. The publisher and the author ought to share the responsibility to lessen the burden on the readers by making sure the down-loaded programs indeed work. The added frustration is: where to turn to if they don't work. Please test the programs to make sure they will work for new versions of C/C++ compilers or at least give us a warning or even charge a fee for the patch. What a headache trying endlessly to make Roberts' entended libraries work!
2,Too simple,Like a previous reviewer wrote the librarys used were written by the author and they hide the true definition of c language.I mean when you finish this book and go to a more advanced level by choosing another c book which uses the standard libraries then you will be confused.
2,Too simple,Like a previews reviewer wrote the librarys used were written by the author and they hide the true definition of c language.I mean when you finish this book and go to a more advanced level by choosing another book which uses the standard libraries then you will be confused.
2,confusing,"Roberts uses his own library to hide detail mechanism in C programming. For some people, it is easier. However, I disagree. I think, for most beginners, it is a source of confusion that he does not use the standard library. It is very important that he needs to keep consistency with other books and the standard library."
1,"Teaches ""Roberts,"" not C","This book is annoying with the way the author asks the user to write programs using his custom library functions, as opposed to the standard C commands. Because of this, I did not learn about scanf until probably the 7th or 8th week of the C programming course I was in. I feel like that alone warrants a 1-star rating. If you buy this book, you will be learning to program in ""Roberts,"" not C."
2,Too bad printing...,I was frightened when I opened the book... The characters in the book look like a copied-material of a very very old 8-pin dot-printer output...
1,Way to easy and using it's own libraries with no reason,"You might found a lot of Universities using this book as a text for C programming class. This is a good book for student to start learning C. But student will not be able to use whatever they learn to program in this book apply on other situation, because this book uses it's own libraries. It is very inconvience for both teachers and students to follow the exercises if they dont have the the libraries install in their sytem."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"Please, please, do not buy this book.I am a Grad Student at NIU and we use this book for the basic C class here. This book is useless! Most of the book needs the ""specially made for the book"" header files included with it to run the C code; therefore the book does not teach real C. If you go on to any thing higher in Computer Science this book will be of no use to you, due to the way it is written. ...DO NOT BUY BAD C BOOKS LIKE THIS!"
2,The extended libraries won't work,"The book is fine but it requires the reader to download the extended libraries from the publisher's web site thru FTP. I tried to use MS C++ 6.0 and Borland C++ 5.0, both compilers were not able to run Roberts' programs. It was a very frustrating experience for me. There was no help.."
3,Odd-ball but interesting,"Well, got this book at a second-hand bookshop in Portland, and even though I was kind of put off by the first several chapters -- kind of over-written -- ultimately I found it a pretty good read. There are some extremely funny characters, and some interesting observations on tortured love-affairs, and a lot of side-thoughts about a whole bunch of things. Some of the chapters I found irritating, while others were excellently written. All in all, I'd give it a B+."
4,Remarkable Book,"This is really a wonderful book. It's intelligent, witty, poignant, but ultimately, very very funny. The characters of American and European ex-patriates in southeast Asia are very accurately portrayed (I know, I was there), and with a tremendously keen eye for detail, and for the way people speak, think, act. I hear this book is really hard to find now... but if you can find it, buy it. (I'm here looking for a copy for a gift for a friend who's about to go to Nepal)."
1,I don't know what book the other reviewers read...,"Howard Cole did not strike me as the writer-genius the other reviewrs make him out to be. Though a valiant effort at a first novel this is no great novel. I bought it on the strenght of the reviews and was very disappointed. Cole's prose reads like a loosely joined account of actual events in the writers life but fictionalized. His descriptions are nothing more than lists of things and their places and seem to build to no effect or purpose.His charaters are glitchy. Now, I am the sort of person who will read anything, but I couldn't force myself to finish this novel, so I skipped to the end. I can not recoment a novel that attempts to be serious fiction but ends in a kung-fu fight. The whole affair struck me as sophomorish."
5,She's way over top of those girls her age on the scene,"""With Book Of Lies Miranda bursts through the doors of the music industryand shouts, ""I'm hear! Listen to me!"" and if the industry doesn't hear,well they must be deaf, because with only 3 songs, Miranda proves thatshe's definitely got what it takes to make it with the best of them andshe's way over top of those girls her age on the scene.""- Mossip - Andrea Guy"
2,pricey but did noy do the job,i've had cheaper products work much better. gave it a 2star bc it was not greasy but otherwise nothing else. returned it 3weeks ego and still no answer from seller. will update if i dont hear from them
4,Neova Cream,I love this night cream. It is smooth and soaks into your skin quickly. It does not burn and leaves your skin completely moisturized without feeling greasy.
3,They die too young,"I love the product; we've got the entire weather station. But, these outdoor temp/humidity sensors don't last 2 years. Too bad. I'm going to replace this component this time, but next time it fails, I'm not buying Oregon Scientific any more!"
2,Should last longer - or be covered under warranty for longer...,"Just like some others here, I have to buy one as a replacement for the one that came with the weatherstation package. It lasted about 3 years and was protected from elements (mounted under open deck). It still shows the temperature correct, but the humidity shows about 30% too low (shows 18%, should be 46%).Not sure if I would recommend or buy Oregon Scientific products again, but at least mine made it 3 years and was pretty accurate during that time."
2,This is a replacement unit....,"I unfortunately had to buy this unit as a replacement for the one that came with my Oregon Scientific weather station. I find that the temperature is not very accurate when it is in the sun. When the unit is in the sun, the temperature reading can be up to 5 degrees off in the summer. But, it works well in the winter. Too bad I had to buy this one as a replacement for the original that lasted <3 years."
2,Short lived,"I had the same experience as some other reviewers. The sensor only last two years at most. First the rechargeable battery died, because it is custom made I couldn't replace it, not even the manufacturer sells it retail. I could still use it by replacing the back up standard batteries but that negates the advantages of the solar power.Then the moisture sensor functionally died. I can still get a ""number"" but it is well below the real value. This malfunction also happened to other Oregon Scientific outdoor moisture sensor that I had, but at least that one was cheaper. Also dew point readings were not available for values below 30 F or so even when new.I will buy another one at a discount because the rest of the station works just fine but if you are going to spend money on a new station you may consider similarly price ones from other manufacturer."
4,Oregon Scientific Sensor Thgr968,"The sensor work better than the THGR268 sensor, Also, it has a solar cell for energy supply. The Amazon seller's description is limited and does not indicate the solar cell is included (which it is)and it is used on not only the WMR112 but as a replacement for the WMR968. The seller's low price and rapid delivery is a plus for purchasing this item on Amazon."
4,enjoyable,"l love the meal prepartion ideas and have tried several with success. The articles are interesting and not too ""fluffy"""
1,do not buy,"they automatically renew even after you cancel it and repeatedly bill you , they have done it to so many people do your research before buying"
3,Ads Galore!!!,"This magazine put me off on the first issue because it is at least 50% ads, but I do enjoy the recipes. But for $5 it's descents at best."
2,ALL ADVERTISEMENTS!,When a magazine has very low cost to get started that should be a red flag! These magazines are mostly ALL advertisements! I went through and tore out all the pages that had advertisements on both sides and it took out about 3/4 of the magazine! And the rest of those pages had advertisements on one page or half the page. Big rip off and I have since switched magazines!
2,The Magazine Diva Says........,This mag needs a new editor. I haven't seen anything interesting in Better Homes for six months. Maybe they are spread too thin with their website and contests.
1,"Nothing but ads, Better to read a gardening blog",We got these magazines because of the big name attached to it. I thumbed through the magazine and never found any articles. The only thing in it were ads.I get better information through gardening/decorating blogs and definitely better service as people help each other on these sites. A huge waste.
5,"Great Magazine for the ""settled "" woman","When I was in my 20's I do not think these magazine would have been for me. But now that I am a home owner with a family I love to look through it! I guess different things are exciting now:) What I like about the magazine is that it has a lot of areas they cover, from recipes, to crafting, to everything for the home. It is not quite Martha Stuart fancy,more like ""the real woman's Martha Stuart!).Voice Lessons To Go v.1-4 The Complete Set"
4,Couldn't resist subscribing to this magazine at this great price,Fabulous recipes and ideas are featured in this magazine at a very affordable price; way less than the supermarkets check-out lanes.
5,Hello...,"For those of you that complain about advertisments in magazines, what are you whining about? How do you thinkmagazines get a nice chunk of their funding? They have companies pay to have their products advertised in the mag.so shut up.On a happier note, I love this magazine. It has wonderfuly lovely ideas for make your house look beautiful though some of the ideas do seem a little pricey."
5,Great Magazine,"Loads of ideas, interesting reading. I love this magazine, love to look at all the different ideas and suggestions and how to's"
2,AKA...Better Homes and Advertising,"I ordered this magazine recently only to cancel my subscription. There is way too much advertising in the magazine and none of the crafts or projects really enticed me to get creative. It's too bad. Go with Martha Stewart Living or Sunset magazines instead, both high quality."
3,75% advertisements,"I was so sad to realize how bad the advertisements had gotten. Part of the beauty of having magazine subscriptions are the relaxing moments of leisurely flipping through the pages; browsing all of informative and visually appealing pages it has to offer. Unfortunately, in comparison with it's competition, Better Homes and Gardens magazine doesn't seem to offer this anymore. I'd rather just jump onto their website. Very disappointing."
5,Long-time Subscriber,"I have had a subscription to this magazine for many years. Although the longer I live in AZ, the less interesting the gardening sections are, there are still an abundant of excellent ideas to use in your home & recipes to try. Will continue to re-new (as long as the price is right!)"
5,Plenty of ideas for a low price.,"I always get a good deal on subscriptions to BH & G. Although there is a lot of advertising, I find it comparable to other magazines in that way. There are tons of ideas in here and it's a great magazine to peruse before redecorating a room or even a house.I always love looking at different people's homes and gardens. The gardens are absolutely beautiful and although I can't use too many of their ideas (I'm in zone 10), I can get ideas on garden structures and design.Lots of great recipes and ideas on entertaining as well."
1,advertisments only=== waist of time,"I was given a gift subscription to Better Homes and Garden. Please, what a waist of money and my time. Every other page has an advertisment of any kind. I went through a few entire magazines with my friends and husband and counted the pages where actually some home information were given, to find out that one entire magazine, taken out the advertisments and commercializing and sweepstakes,etc has maybe 25-30 pages of articles other that advertisent. Please check by yourselves, please do!! I wrote BHG a letter and never never got an answer."
1,what magazines,Haven't received my subscription yet! I going to give this product more time to arrive to my home before I contact who is responsible.
4,One of my favorite magazines,"I'm always happy to see my issue of Better Homes & Garden show up. Overall this magazine is great. I especially enjoy the decorating/home parts of this magazine. I could personally do without the garden part, but it's still good."
1,Have yet to receive the first issue,"even though I subscribed December the fifteenth and now it is nearly February. I was told this was a possibility but then I got this email asking for my review. If my check is taken, I should get a magazine. I subscribed to Southern Living at the same time and have had it for nearly two weeks."
4,Good resource!,I love the decorating ideas and color suggestions - absolutely do-able and attractive. Menu ideas are also delicious and easy.
3,not as good as grandma's,"I remember looking at this magazine when my grandmother subscribed to it many years ago. It was really interesting and high quality. Although the content is still fairly good, the magazine is now very thin, and includes much less information that is worth reading. I also noticed that over the course of my two year subscription, the physical quality was also quickly slipping. The color layers didn't match up, so that some of the pages were not readable. Some of the pages were cut improperly so that parts of articles were missing. This occured several times through the year. I still think that it is a good magazine to buy from the magazine rack if the issue looks interesting that month, but I won't spend my money on another subscription this year."
1,Bait and Switch Scam Experts,"My wife wanted a subscription to BHG magazine. After submitting online, I found the ""fine print"" that stated ""as a convenience your subscription will be renewed automatically at the current subscription rates"". I don't think so. Then, I looked at others who were more unfortunate than me and actually went through with the subscription, only to find that they were getting billed automatically, at much higher rates, almost immediately after their subscription began.STAY AWAY FROM Better Homes and Gardens! There are better ""homes"" magazines out there, that do not try to take advantage of their customer base the way BHG does."
1,One big ad for mediocrity,"I too have been getting BHG due to the folding of Readymade. Unfortunately, I have a pricey subscription to Readymade until 2014, for which I am getting a cheap magazine that I am uninterested in. The articles are cookie cutter, lacking in imagination, and uninspiring. So much so that I often can't tell the difference between the ads and the content. All in all, BHG doesn't engage me in the least.I agree that BHG is a sorry replacement for Readymade! What were they thinking?"
3,"Beautiful photography, lousy articles, too much advertising","After hearing such good reviews of this magazine, I picked up a copy of this month's Better Homes and Gardens from the grocery store as a trial before subscription. The photography was wonderful, and it boasted some great ideas through the photography, but the articles were too brief and lousy. Moreover, I was thoroughly disappointed with the overabundance of advertisement that litters this magazine. I was very much disappointed. I was expecting more than just good ideas from pictures."
5,history of motorcycle racing,This is part 3 of the series of motorcycle racing with emphasis on races in England and Europe. Covers the moderm period.
1,Not from this seller,"The fern arrived not properly packaged, very small specimen in dry soil, half of the leaves fell offafter first three days. The plant died completely after one month. Interesting plant but buy it somewhere else."
1,There are few things in this world that are overly sweetened. MORE than this product!!,"It's 110% sugar and no substance.Do NOT feed this to your kids, and they will thank you for it.It's just white on white on white, and a couple of zig zags.Did I mention the amount of sugar packed into these nasty things?!?!?!?!I don't know HOW I used to EAT these things...Ugh.1.2 stars."
3,Nice pen,"It's a nice pen, but I returned it because it wasn't what I was looking for. I didn't write with it, but it looked nice."
2,Typical Hollywood hardboiler,"Julia Cameron wants this book to be made into a screenplay so bad!! I can even see Bruce Willis in the leading role. Actually, it reads more like a screenplay that's been turned into a book.This novel has every Hollywood-detective cliche: Irish cop in Chicago with marital problems; beautiful and sexy doctor who's also a suspect (and whom cop can't keep his mind off of); a suspicious partner who the cop hates; a sordid sex/Satanic cult that is linked to the cop and everyone he knows. And when the cult goes after the cops son (like you knew they would), things get really personal!Another thing that bothered me: everyone, I mean everyone, knows everyone in this story and everything about them. From the doctor on the top of the social ladder to the scum at the bottom, they all know each other intimately. In a city the size of Chicago I find that hard to believe!"
1,It doesn't work like that... at all.,"I don't know the author's nonfiction, but this book is laughable, in places reading more like a parody of New Age attitudes than a thriller.First, the cliches just pile up. Tough-but-sensitive hero, tough-and-traumatized blonde ""suspect"", molested little son, the absurd ""lookalike"" plot device, the trendy cult/kiddie porn stuff. Then everybody is mysteriously connected with everything and everybody else - very small town, Chicago. The hero sleepwalks through this scenario, agonizing, studying his own inner life, depending on visions, hunches and mumbo-jumbo and usually doing nothing - this would be a much shorter book if he just did his job. The author's idea of police work is as hilarious as her ""masculine"" writing. And there is something quite unpleasant about those long, frequent, detailed, oh-so outraged descriptions of porn and kinkyness."
5,The best kind of surprise,"OK, I warily approached reading The Dark Room when I got it for Christmas. It was a big, crime story that was well, dark. I trudged through the first chapter...then I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN. It is riveting, with no slow spots. I can't remember the last time I read a book that I could not wait to get home to, that I would sneak to read on my lunch hour, that woke me up an hour before work, summoning me to read. Hell, even Morning Pages couldn't do that! I want to send this book to everyone who wants to rediscover the thrill of reading fiction again. I sure did. READ THIS BOOK!"
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"I highly recommend this book. I purchased a lot of the wrong books for learning fingerstyle and other methods. This book takes you from beginner and beyond. I'm not a rank beginner but this covered all the basics quickly and clearly to impart an excellent review. The charming and progressively challenging etudes was what I was looking for to develop my skills for playing brazilian jazz. I like this book so much, I plan on purchasing the next level book. An excellent book."
5,Excellent File!!!,"This file is the best I've owned! It's thin, flexible, and durable. It is washable. It's perfect for my thick real nails. It should last a long time."
4,Sunset in St Tropez,What an interesting book funny colourful combined with a strong women appealing venue for a story.Danielle Steel is amazing how she comes up with such interesting story lines
5,Read It In A Day,"Sunset in St. Tropez was hard to put down.I finished the novel in a day.But of course,one has to expect a typical Danielle Steel novel - simple and great for light reading and entertainment - to fully appreciate it.Highly recommended for people who love guilty pleasure novels."
2,Intended order: Audio book,I may be mistaken but my order was for an Audio book with the same title.
4,Pleasurable punctual read,I agree that the book is rather truncated. It was definitely a delight to read though. Agathe is priceless!!!
3,too short........,"I am a big fan of Danielle Steel's books, but I thought this one was too short. It was an okay book, but at the end it left you wondering what happened after that."
1,do yourself a favor and NEVER read this,"This book was slow and boring, not to mention predictable. I feel like a stupider person having read this book and i feel that i wasted my life reading it. Take my advice and don't waste your time."
1,Absolutely Terrible!,This book was a complete and utter waste of time. The storyline is totally predictable and very shallow. There is basically no character development and no plot. The editing was terrible as the writing was redundant in many places. It was just not enjoyable reading at all. I cannot believe this was even published. I haven't read Danielle Steele in quite a while and - after reading this - I'm not going to bother with her books in the future.
2,Not Danielle Steel's best work,"I've read all of Danielle Steele's books. However, this one was so predictable. I'm starting to find her books very boring. Put it this way I will never purchase any more of her books. My favorites were The Ring, Jewel and Heartbeat to name only a few. At one time I couldn't wait for her new book to come out. Before this book and the one before that she was one of my favorite authors ... now I really can't say."
1,Not worth the read.,This was the first book by Danielle Steele that I have read and it will be the last I read by her. I was truly disappointed and believe she is a highly over-rated author. The story was VERY drawn out and I caught myself dozing off a few times because the book was so boring. If you want to fall asleep quick then this is the book for you
2,Totally Predictable,"Danielle Steel's writing has really slipped over the years. She's cranking out novels at an unbelievable speed and her writing is not nearly what it used to be. When I first started reading her books 20 years ago, they really swept me away and into the story. Some were a tad predictable, but still very engrossing and interesting. Anymore, her stories are completely predictable, with no twists and turns at all. I didn't enjoy this one much at all!"
3,Needs alot of Improvement,"This is definintely not Danielle Steels best book (that is 'Accident') nor is it her worst (that's 'Irresistible Forces'). The story is about five friends and an extremely famous movie star in a rundown mansion in St Tropez and the month they spend together. This is most possibly one of the most repetitive Danielle Steel books I have ever read. She keeps making the same points over and over again. Pascale and Diana distrust Gwen, we get the point, yet the author repeats this and the reasons why on almost every single page. Plus, alot of the little 'surprises' you see from the beginning. This is not a horrible reading experience, and it's also not too enjoyable."
1,disappointing,I don't believe that Ms. Steele could have written such a shallow tale. The sunset on St. Tropez and it wasn't very pretty.
3,same as all the other ones...,"Danielle Steele's books are all the same, just different characters. I don't know why I waste my money on them. The story in this book is light, and very predictable. I figured out the story line half way through the book. If you need something to read just to pass the time...then go ahead and purchase this. But if you are looking for a deep romance book or something than keep on looking. Boring!"
2,Raw Dissappointment,"This novel is really a short story. It's characters do not have the time or space to get fully developed. They are like a good french meal without the main course, and definitely no dessert. I am left completly dissatisfied with this novel(la). Was this perhaps a 24 hour deadline? Did Danielle not get her facts straight about the Cote D'Azure ? Must everyone live happily ever after without first going through believable trials and hardships? C'mon Madame Steele...Can we not approach middle age without greater depth? I am very disappointed with this waste of twenty dollars. We know you are much more capable."
3,"Not Bad, Not Good....Just Somewhere In The Middle","I only need one word to summarize this book: MEDIOCRE.This is the first Danielle Steel book I've read, and I'm hoping that this book is not indicative of her story-telling abilities. I felt a sense of apathy about the novel's storyline and characters from the very first page to the last page. None of the characters are likeable, the dilemmas that they face are of very little consequence, and the dialogue is largely dry and uninteresting. There's absolutely nothing dramatic or compelling within these pages. On the plus side, there's enough material here to keep the reader from wanting to abandon this book without finishing it, though it isn't necessary to complete the book in order to figure out how the story will conclude. The ending was annoyingly predictable.The story kept me mildly entertained for the six hours that it took me to read, though I felt nothing but numb and dispassion after I was done. This is a novel I will soon forget."
1,Yawn!,"I don't know why I keep buying Danielle Steel books. This one was a shocker. The characters were undeveloped and the story predictable and really only scratched the surface of a story that could have been.I have been reading Danielle Steel for over 15 years. I think this will be the last one I buy - I was so disappointed in the story. Having said that, I re-read her older novels over and over which always provide me with great enjoyment despite being read before. Books of Danielle Steel's that I would recommend include 'Remembrance', ' Palomino', 'Changes', 'Thurston House'and 'Wanderlust'.If you are a die-hard fan ... you will probably enjoy this book. If you are new to Danielle Steel - pick an earlier book for a really enjoyable read."
4,I thought it was cute!,"I thought this was a cute story. I mean, it was sad, but had it's funny points. It was light summer reading. I know it had many bad reviews, but my recommendation would be to read what it's about and if you're interested, try it & if you don't like it, put it down.I think for Danielle Steel fans, it's one of her better new novels."
1,This book is a -1,"I have to echo the comments of the reviewer from Windsor, ON Canada who said:""The storyline is totally predictable and very shallow. There is basically no character development and no plot. The editing was terrible as the writing was redundant in many places. It was just not enjoyable reading at all. I cannot believe this was even published. I haven't read Danielle Steele in quite a while and - after reading this - I'm not going to bother with her books in the future. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.""Please note that I too used to read Danielle Steel and I used to enjoy her books. This ""book"" should have been condensed into a short story, (which could have been a pleasant little story)but 230 pages of redundancy was just too much."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in Sunset in St. Tropez. This is definately not one of Danielle Steele's better books. I didn't think the story had much body to it, though I did enjoy the strength of the relationships and how I really felt these couples were devoted to each other. As for the obsessiveness of the lead women characters toward the supporting female, I could have done without that."
1,Misery in St. Tropez,"Cannot remember a reading a worse book. Boring, uninteresting story, repetitive dialogue. The only good think about it is that it is very short."
5,Superb Spy Comedy!!,"This is a great spy comedy starring Robert Hayes about a honeymooning couple who accidently becomes involved in counterfeiting swindle.Set in beautiful Spain,it's a must see!!"
3,Rainy Day Movie,"The acting is superb, as usual, from these stars, but the story is a little slow developing. Once the plot gets moving, it's very entertaining. Not the best movie Peter ever made, but you can see his characterizations developing into the Columbo character later in his career. This is well worth watching........better than most of today's movies."
1,BAD DISK,"Two movies...ONE disk.BOTH movies had play problems on my state of the art system. The original movie had tracking issues throughout, finally came to a halt about halfway through. Only by polishing the disk with toothpaste and a micro fiber was I able to watch to completion.Disk 2 simply stopped less than halfway through, did NOT respond to any further attempts or remedies. The disk was even difficult in ejecting from my player. Once it came out, it went into the trash and I ended up spending $2.99 to watch the rest online."
5,THE INLAWS,"WE LOVED THE ORIGIONAL IN LAWS WITH PETER FALK & ALAN ARKIN THEY SHOULD'VE NEVER MADE THE ONE WITH MICHAEL DOUGLAS WHAT A WASTE OF TALENT, ALBERT BROOKS ACTED LIKE KEVIN JAMES & ADAM SANDLER LIKE THREE YEARS."
5,Peter Falk At His Best.,"The Movie Is A Classic, But The Remake Blows Goats. Peter Falk Was Just ON FIRE In This Role. He Made His Acting Look Effortless, And Carried The Movie The Way All Good Actors Do."
5,deeply spiritual & hard swinging,"Andy McKee is one of the world's most gifted jazz bass players. he's played with Philly Joe Jones, Hank Mobley, Johnny Hartman, Elvin Jones, Chet Baker, Michel Petrucianni, Mal Waldron, Steve Lacy, Marcial Solal, Jaki Byard, Billy Harper, Mingus Dynasty Band... I could go on. This project features Andy playing many of his compositions with a killin' line up of some of the finest players of today, including Idris Muhammad on drums and Joe Locke on vibes. Check it out - you won't be disappointed."
5,wanna hear music ?,"andy mckee's one world is called jazz,ok,maybe, and : it is a fusion of many styles from all over the world put together to something delighting for the mind and the soul. in short words his music passed my test : hearing it over and over again the wish to hear it again ( ok, maybe a few days later )remains."
2,Not a classic!,"Sadly, this book has not become a classic but on the contrary has aged prematurely.The ideas presented are nothing new anymore and the solutions suggested are now themselves subject to founded criticism.Current ecological or health issues had not been foreseen by the authors and what appeared visionary ten years ago is now incomplete, repetitious and almost bland.Therefore, it would difficult to recommend anyone to invest time and money in reading this book in 2009 or later."
1,horriable,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The opinions are so biased and unfair. Any of the evidence that they so call ""back up"" their arguments with are unsubstantial and has no real value. This book is very aggravating to me and should not be read by anyone."
4,Read for General Interest,"This book was recommended by a friend, and since Mr. Duany has been to Sarasota (where I now live) as a consultant, I decided to read it out of general interest. I was pleasantly surprised how readable it was, and many of the concepts of community that I was exposed to as a child were presented. And most importantly, it explained my preferences in leisure vacation travel for the convenient, comfortable community destinations--whether they be in large cities or in nearly rural locations. It is good reading for anyone who is or will be affected by growth or redevelopment."
4,Good Intro to Urban/Regional Planning,"This is the first book I've read in the field of Planning. Very easy to read, informative, and really gets you excited about the material. I would recommend it highly"
5,Fascinating!!!,"Without getting mired in the politics rife in other reviews, I will just say that this book is extremely interesting. Having been fortunate enough to live most of my life in academic communities (necessarily pedestrian oriented) I have seen first hand the concepts that the authors are driving at. Mixed-use multi-density neighborhoods are vibrant thirving places to live, work and play, while the mondern suburb is simply a place to keep your stuff and sleep. I intentionally moved from an affluent suburban neighborhood to a less upscale intown duplex simply because I got tired of driving absolutely everywhere, despite owning an import sports car that is a joy to drive."
3,"Thought provoking, but incomplete","Has some good observations on the shortcomings of suburbia (but nothing we haven't heard before). Most intriguing are the discussions about different legal rules and zoning laws that prevent engineers from trying new designs that might work better.A real weakness of the book is the lack of in-depth examination of what works in suburbia. Highly mobile Americans do have a choice and they still choose suburbia over rural or urban areas. Suburbia, for all its drawbacks, seems to offer a clean, safe environment with housing that remains a good investment. This work could have been better if its solutions built upon those strengths rather than lay waste to the neighborhoods where more than half of Americans live."
2,poor battery/charger/carmera battery control,"When I just bought Dimage Xt, it was able to take ~200 photos with fully charged battery. After 1 year, camera started to show ""low battery"" sign at power on, even when the battery was freshly charged, and the sign turned into red after ~50 photos and camera shutdown itself after that. Then I bought a new battery, the same thing happened as soon as I started to use it, I can only take ~60 photos with the new battery. I don't know the problem came from battery, battery charger, or battery controller in camera.While you can keep a few batteries as backup, but sometime it's not an option. I have a marine kit and take underwater photo, and it's a hassel to change battery in water."
4,Slim and Lightweight but...,"This lithium-ion battery is just absolute madness. It is so small and light that you find it hard to believe it is real. It takes around one hour and a half to get fully charged, and it lasts approximately 1 hour and fifteen to twenty minutes, in case you use the camera with the LCD. If you turn it off it will last considerably longer (but it is less fun :-( If you take the camera out for the day it is very likely that you will need an extra battery. The last thing, after a heavy use of the camera it gets really hot."
2,It's working fine for now...,"It's worth it to purchase a Minolta battery and not a no-name brand that replaces the NP200. So far, this genuine battery has a good battery life and recharges to its full capacity."
1,MINOLTA LITHIUM ION BATTERY,"SIR, TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU. I PURCHASED THIS BATTERY WHEN I ORDERED MY KODAK DIGITAL. YOU SUGGESTED I BUY THIS BATTERY. I WENT TO INSERT AND IT DOES NOT FIT MY CAMERA. IT IS TOO SMALL. PLEASE HELP ME I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN FOR A REFUND. MARGIE"
2,cheese!,"OK, first you grab two pieces of seven-grain bread, fling 'em into the toaster on medium. Then, with your Ginsu knife, thinly slice eight or nice squares of havarti, as well as a diced roma tomato. When the toast pops, butter it and lay down evenly the havarti and tomatoes, adding a shake or three of pepper to taste.What? Oh, I though we were giving out our recipes for cheese sandwiches here. Must have been the music, I guess.Yes, this is a cheesy album, not her superb last CD, I Am Shelby Lynne, by a long shot."
4,SHAKTHI THE POWER ROCKS!,"ON THE WHOLE SHAKTHI THE POWER ROCKS! THE FILM HAS A HARD HIITING STORYLINE,SUPERB MUSIC AND NOTEWORTHY PERFORMENCES.NANA PATEKAR IS FANTASTIC!SANJAY KAPOOR IS VERY GOODKRISHMA KAPOOR CARRIES THE FILM ON HER SHOULDERS.SRK SHAHRUKH KHAN ROCKS IN A CAMEO.A MUST BUY."
4,very powerful movie as the title appropriately suggests.,This is an excellent movie if you are into feminism and can get past the gory details. It is quite a powerful movie and Karisma has really proved herself as an actress in this movie. It's about a mother's fight for her child. Nana Patekar and Sanjay Kapoor also star in this jam-packed film. It's definitely a must see for any women (as well as any daring men).
2,Shakti,"Very disappointed with this dvd. The quality was so bad it took away from the story especially when you have to use subtitles. Had read another review before buying this dvd and that had said the quality was very bad I should have heeded their advice. Also disappointed that Aishwarya Rai only appeared in a dream sequence where she only looked sexy while dancing such a waste of a good actress in such a second rate role. Her role only lasted a minute so I take it the producers of this film only used her as a draw card. Do not buy this dvd if you are expectly to see Aishwarya Rai acting, well its hard to see anything really because of the bad film quality and reducing the size of the screen does not improve it one iota."
4,Collected Country's Recipe Output,"Culling the newspapers, magazines, books and Net for recipes to cover range of standardized categories of appetizers, soups, salads, etc. is no easy task. Then to cover diversity of ethnicity, difficulty, etc. is daunting as well. Cut is always tough of what's in, what's out.Nice job of providing range of easy and quick to exotic and time/ingredient/equipment consuming. There are recipes that will be luscious yet easy and simple to prepare or the more challenging, multi-layered creations.Enjoy their inclusion of: Mango and Lime Chiffon Cake; Rick Bayless' Chocolate Pecan Pie Bars; Glazed Pearl Onions with Mustard and Brown Sugar; Three-Way Pork Burgers; Millionaire's Brisket with Coffee and Beer Mop Sauce; Tomato, Goat Cheese and Focaccia Pudding; Moroccan Herb Salad; North African Tomato Bulgur Soup; Chilled Potato-Chive Soup."
3,says who???????????,I was very excited to recieve this book but so far the recipes have fallen short. It's probably a very difficult task to compile a collection like this but there is a lot here that is very average.
4,MAGAZINE,The Sports Illustrated magazine came just in time so we didn't miss any issues. Thanks. Cheaper than renewing elsewhere.
4,Sports Illustrated magazine,"Finally figured out after years of Sports Illustrated for Kids, that my 13 year old was ready for some more ""serious"" sports magazines. He loves it!"
5,Excellent vaue,This was handled in a very expedient manner and is an excellent value. My son enjoys the magazine especially during football season.
4,Sports illustrated,I like it very much I got my first issue way before I was suppose to get it.I was surprised it came so early
1,DO NOT WANT,"I do not know why this subscription is being renewed automatically. I do not want it to be renewed automatically. My subscription does not expire until December, 2014 - no need to renew now. I normally renew through school programs. A $39 renewal is much more than I pay. Please cancel this renewal and let me know if I have other subscriptions to be handled in the same fashion"
1,Sports Illustrated subscription,"The address that was recorded was incorrect and after I notified them to change it, they didn't change it. I like Amazon.com, but this was unacceptable."
5,Sports Illustrated,"This magazine subscription was a Christmas gift for my husband, who loves sports. The price was excellent and now he will be receiving the yearly Swimsuit Issue for his reading enjoyment. I am glad I made this purchase at such a great price."
2,wheres sybil danning????,"I had this vhs movie years ago, I got it for the sole purpose of Sybil Danning being in it,yeah for like 5 minutes. The only plus is Russ Meyer vixen Kitten Natividad playing a topless dancer, that made up for what I payed for it but the movie blah."
4,Good book for school counselors,This is a good book that helps counselors work to solve student's problems by including the whole family/community in the problem solving process. I like the way it encourages parents to take a stand and be parents.
5,Very Inspiring,This book inspired me to believe you can do anything you set your mind to. Excellent read........
2,A brilliant life and an okay book,Reginald Lewis had an incredible life and I wish he was better known to the public. By the time of his early death this black man had conqured the business world. The book is okay. The author seems star struck and the book is as slick as a celebrity/movie magazine. It's Lewis' official and sanitized biography and doesn't atempt to be anything more than that. Hopefully some other writer will take a crack at this amazing man's life.
2,"Great Man, Bad Book","While the tale of Reginald F. Lewis is truly an inspirational one, this book is very poorly written and not a smooth read at all."
2,Not for Me,"Have you ever read a book that you had to struggle to get through, yet you were still glad you read it? That is my feeling about this book. I found the book boring, tedious to read at times and a bit more technical than what I'm used to. Nevertheless, I could not get past the fact that Reginald Lewis and all that he accomplished after starting with nothing was an incredibly inspirational story that needed to be told. His drive and inability to accept ""no"" are something that we can all learn from and appreciate, but the writing in the book just didn't hold my attention."
4,Great and undeservedly unknown,"This book is a fitting tribute to a great, self-made entrepreneur, whoset his goals on a daily basis, was highly self-disciplined and meticulousin carrying them out and above all, was highly ambitious in the bestsense of the word.Strangely enough, reading through Connie Bruck's Predator's Ball,which chronicles the takeover movement of the 1980s, and containsa considerable segment on TLC Beatrice, one of Drexel's majordeals, there is no mention whatsoever of Reginald F. Lewis. Strange.The writing in this book is not the greatest, and the author (not Lewishimself) has a habit of throwing around dollar words when it'sunnecessary and uninformative.However, this is the only autobiography of a great man, and one thatis also inspiring. Well Recommended."
5,Captivating,The life and times of Reginald Lewis is an extraordinary story. It's the story of a man with drive and determination. Reg Lewis was driven by his will to win and be the best that he could possibly be. This book will be one that chills your spine and warm your heart at the same time. I assure you this book will provide you with all the reason you need to follow your dreams.
5,"Powerful,Challenging and Exciting","This book demostrated, that we can start with little or nothing and acheive are goals and dreams. Mr. Lewis showed us that with a plan and hard work, we can acheive that silver lining. He was a professor in teaching the world aboutthe importants school, business, race, hostility, prejudice, and the family structure. Their were many obstacle trying to hold Mr. Lewis back, but he would get back up and try again. I began reading the fascinating book on my way to Italy. I could not put it down. I accidently packed it in my luggage on my return trip to the states. I was in the last few chapters. I couldn't wait to unpack it to finish reading it. All students should be required to read the book. It will truly excite and motivate them. Mr. Lewis prove that you can succeed.I'm just sorry that Mr. Lewises young life was cut short. Iwish he would have given interviews. He was truly a man that the world needed to know"
5,WOW is all I can say.,This book made me want to work so much harder in life to achieve my business goals. The key is fake it until you make it. No one knows you struggles unless you tell them and you can't make excuses for your life and why you have to work hard. I read it fast and read it again.
5,VISIONARY!,"After reading this book, you can't help but agree that Reginald Lewis was a visionary. After years of hearing others say ""You've gotta read the book,"" I finally did, and there was no regret.While reading, I could relate to quite a few hurdles that Lewis had to jump; and despite the opposition to all that he had in mind, he remained focused on his ultimate goal. Its obvious that he wasn't trying to impress anyone, or prove that an African-American could do it. He was proving to the world that African-Americans are just as human as anyone else; therefore, we should be judged based upon our character, and work.This book of Lewis' life and work was an inspiration, and I would recommend that anyone of color, or anyone who feels the pressure of the world telling them ""to slow down and be like the rest of us,"" should READ THIS BOOK!"
5,Excellent Read,I heard about this book on the Tom Joyner Morning Show's little know Black history facts and the title caught and held my attention...This is a book all men should read before the age of 15....Excellent Story!!!
4,Great album!,"This is a great album by The Platters! The quality of this recording is quite decent. If you are a music collector, don't miss this item."
4,It's not the Chattanooga Choo-Choo,"I LIKE Amtrak - it's cozy and one can sit back and enjoy the scenery - the segment on the ""Empire Builder"" between Minneapolis/St. Paul and LaCrosse, Wisconsin along the Mississippi River is especially beautiful. This techno-thriller about terrorism against railroads had the bad timing to have been published this summer - just months before September 11. Nonetheless, it is a good, taut thriller involving a US Bullet-type train; Peter Tyler, an unjustly ""fallen"" ex-cop; Umberto Alvarez, a science teacher whose family just happened to be at a railroad crossing in Genoa, IL at the wrong time; and (somewhat trite)greedy corporate executives and their sleazy `security"" entourage. It's worth the trip!"
4,A Page Turner,"Ridley Pearson is a newly discovered author for me. I am highly gratified to discover he has written several previous novels which I am already starting to enjoy. Like his previous novels, Parallel Lies is a real page turner. It is one of those novels that makes you tell yourself, ""Just one more chapter, then I'll turn the light out and get some sleep!"" The protagonists are sympathetic with believable motives. The premise is a bit stale, wronged individual against the evil corporation, but Mr. Pearson handles this artfully.The relationship that developed between the Fed and the railroad honcho seemed plausable enough, but nothing much was made of it being interracial. In today's social climate, this would be more of an issue.This is an exciting, fast paces read and he obviously and done extensive research on rail systems of today.I am looking forward to enjoying all of Ridley Pearson's past and future novels."
2,Not a Very Good Book,"I have been a Ridley Pearson fan for years and have read most if not all of his books. This one however, I fould hard to even complete. The characters simply did not click, and it was hard to form a reader's bond with them. The plot was equivilant to a sub ""B"" movie plot, which would probably not even get made. Sorry, but I did not like this one at all."
4,Parallel Lines,"Another exciting book from a great author. He always has a new twist around the next corner. Parallel is exciting, breathtaking and downright thrilling in the end. Bravo!!! Can't wait for the next book!"
3,a ridley-iculous tale of fast trains,"This book was written to attract the attention of Hollywood producers. It gives the story of a widower, seeking revenge on the evil train company who refuses to admit fault in the deaths of his wife and children. The story is fast paced and easy to read, though difficult to believe. Take it with a grain of salt."
3,Suspense comes later,"I got this book because I thought it would be a good suspense read, one that would keep me up reading till 3 in the morning. Well, this wasn't it...at least until later in the book. The plot was dragged out beyond belief. It was only when you got t0 the last few chapters of the book that you didn't want to put it down. It could have used a couple more suspensful moments throughout the book to keep the reader interested. When I get a new suspense/thriller book I usually read it within a week. This book took me a month and a half. I just wasn't excited about picking it up at nite. So, if you buy it just be prepared to wait for the exciting parts."
2,Less than stellar,"This is nowhere near Ridley Pearson's best work. Neither Peter Tyler nor Nell Priest were characters that I was able to warm up to. The plot became more improbable with each page. If this is your first Pearson, don't give up hope. Go back and find any book with Lou Boldt and Daphne Matthews. Then you will understand why people wait for these books!"
2,Very disappointing effort from great author,"Just finished Parallel Lies and feel cheated - I am a huge fan of Ridley Pearson, having read the entire Lou Boldt series. This book just does not reflect the creativity, energy, plot and character development found in Pearson's other works - seems like it was perhaps an older manuscript buffed up and published. The story plods along, never gels, and the ending is another throw-away, poorly thought out and ill-conceived. I have had similar disappointments with Deaver and Patterson's recent attempts. What happens to these guys? If you like trains you may like this -otherwise leave this one in the station."
4,"New people, new subject, good book","I've read all of Ridley's books and I would rank this among the best. (Some of the other reviewers must not get that Ridley's characters are only developed with the depth that the story and sub-stories need. That is why most of his writing is hard to put down, he doesn't drown it with excessive text. We know so much about Boldt and Mathew's because there are so many novels with them in it.) In this novel Ridley starts with a theme and a few characters and develops a story in which you're never too sure who to really root for and what the out come should be. I like the fact that this is a stand alone novel and does not have to follow the formula he has developed for the Boldt series."
2,Leaden and dim-witted,"The only thing moving in this book is the bullet train. And that only happens in the last 40 pages or so. Characters are painted so dimly that they barely enter the reader's consciousness (except for the painfully ludicrous high school science teacher who apparently trained at the feet of James Bond). Nothing surprises save one majorly untidy loose end at the conclusion who's name is ...The prose is Cro-Magnon, the plotting Neanderthal. Save your pennies--life is way too short for dreck like this."
2,Run over by a train,"OK, I'm an audiobook guy, I admit it. This one was not a keeper or a passer-alonger to my audiobook gang. Right to the give-it-to-the-library pile or hope to get 2 cents for used. There are so many good mystery/thriller writers out there doing much better stuff than this I feel I wasted my time. When I lunge for the eject button numerous times it's time to hang it up. Colorful packaging however made me snag it. Don't bite or that light you see in the tunnel.......!"
1,Bitterly Disappointing...,"I have enjoyed Pearson's other novels, primarily the Lou boldt series set in Seattle, but this diversion is a dead end. The plot is improbable, and the details impossible. All of the characters are poorly drawn with highly implausable motivations.Let's see: how about a downtrodden white guy, a beautiful black woman with no life of her own (and Pearson doesn't provide a clue!), and let's make the bad guy a Hispanic, who has been terribly wronged by a rich white guy and his successful though shallow corporation. This poorly plotted and predictable novel will cause me to forego any future novels by this author!"
1,A big disappointment,"I've enjoyed Pearson's Lou Boldt novels, and bought this one with great expectations. What a letdown! The characters are stereotypes without depth or passion, the villain is implausible (he's supposed to be a ruthless monomaniac, but pauses for a wistful fling with a waitress he knew years ago). To top it off, no one appears to have proofread the book -- on a single page, for example, Pearson describes a call girl walking ""with a somewhat shaky gate"" and a ""Mercedes coup"" paused at a traffic light. These flaws were so annoying that I couldn't even get to page 100 before tossing the book aside. My guess is that Pearson wrote this manuscript when he was a kid and dusted it off for publication now that his name is well-known. Certainly he can do (and has done) MUCH better than this."
4,I liked flawed characters,"...and Peter Tyler fits the bill perfectly. He loses his temper, loses his job as a D.C. cop, and is probably about to lose his house when a special assignment comes up.Tyler's job is to find Umberto Alvarez, a madman who blames the railroad for the death of his wife and child.I liked the character construction, story lines, and ultimate resolution of this book and would recommend this author to anyone looking for real-to-life characters who are just trying to find their way in this crazy, mixed-up, unfair world.Enjoy!"
4,"Not Boldt-Matthews, but almost as good!","This book was almost as good as Ridley's Boldt-Matthews series, but not quite! It was exciting and a page turner that I had a hard time putting down. The pace continued to the end and had a great climactic ending! Don't for a minute think that I didn't enjoy it immensely, but....I really really love Lou Boldt and Daphne Matthews books! Middle of Nowhere was so great that Ridley would have a hard time competing with himself on that one! If you haven't read the series and want to try Ridley out, Parallel Lies won't disappoint you! Read his series from the beginning though, if you want to read the best series ever!"
2,Plodding along,"Pearson is a very good writer. If you are really into the Boldt/Matthews books (as I am) then this one is very different. Sure there is a relationship. But ""the case"" takes precedence in this read and, as in real life, the puzzle is not necessarily a quick solve. The writing is good. The characters are likeable -- even the terrorist. I struggled to keep my interest alive on this case."
1,Couldn't Even Finish This Boring Tale!,"If you're a Ridley Pearson fan, this one is a big disappointment. It just does not grab you from the beginning like many of his former works do. First of all, I found the major premise of a railroad being sabotaged by a man whose wife and child were killed by a train to be trite. From this point on, it's all downhill as the investigation begins. Sorry, I just couldn't continue with this dull tale. Read at your own risk, but be assured there are lots better offerings out there."
2,Not Up To Par,"As a huge Pearson fan, I wait with bated breath for his latest book. This was average at best. I didn't mind that Lou Boldt and Daphne Matthews were on hiatus, but the main characters were tough to warm up to and therefore connect with. I felt sorry for the protagonist which is never a good-read for me, but a personal preference. I'm hoping Ridley either brings back Boldt and Matthews or invents more inviting new characters and a less sympathetic villian."
3,"Ticket, please....","I was disappointed. I have greatly enjoyed the Lou Boldt novels, but could barely finish this one...and I can read anything. There was no character development...when things got hairy, I found I didn't really care what happened to anyone. The plot was mildly interesting, but had several glaring practical and technological improbabilities...not the least of which was the mutual non-contact orgasm...How does that work? It read more like a script treatment for a Steven Seagal movie. Sorry, better luck next time."
2,Poor product,"I purchased this software after trying the free demo which worked fine. However, once I installed the software, I was not able to see any of my CD/DVD drives at all. I had to restore my computer to a previous state in order to recover, which of course uninstalled the product. I also contacted customer support with no reply. Note to all who purchase, their claim of 24 hour support is an absolute lie."
1,Poor Product didn't do episodic discs,"This product sucks it failed to work with my episodic disc collection. Couldn't get any support either, went to there website fired off a mail and never got a reply. WASTE OF MONEY!"
5,Excellent book on this topic!!!,"Dangerous Grains is a book that will enlighten everyone about gluten intolerance and the damage that is donein the body from wheat .... silent damage that continues unless one knows what is happening. I am thankful thatmy friend recommended I get this book. I encourage all Americans to read it!!!!Thank you,Ruth R/Wisconsin"
1,Not At All Pleased,"I bought this book as per my cousin's suggestion because Braly's theory sounded interesting. I absolutely agree with the Foreword when it says: It's undeniable that whole grains are good nutrition for some of us. The problem is that the author spends the next 180 or so pages talking himself out of it. There is NO DOUBT that celiac disease and gluten sensitivity are real and can be life-threatening--this book is for such sufferers. But to suggest, over and over again, that the huddled masses should go gluten-free, even though asymptomatic, is sliding down a slippery slope. Don't jump on the bandwagon without being fully informed."
1,What a waste!,"Rather than resell this book, I recycled it. This book is superficial and poorly written. I wish I hadn't bought it. I wonder if it were just slapped together and dumped on the market to make a quick buck."
5,Gluten Enlightenment,Includes shocking information about the effects of gluten on the human body. After reading this it will be hard to eat any gluten anymore.
3,Dangerous Grains,"I ordered this because I am researching Celiac Disease and gluten intolerence. It was informative, however it was published in 2002 and I believe there are books out that have been published much more recently with updated information such as ""The Gluten Connection"" and ""Celiac Disease"" also written by a doctor and that was updated in 2010."
1,Dangerous Grains review,Good only for those with gluten sensitivity. Not necessary for those who just want to be gluten free due to no medical problems. Very technical with no recipes and no daily food plan.
4,Nice bag for the price,"I was looking for a good carry bag that I could carry or use on a pull cart or riding cart. This bag has most of the features I wanted - lots of pockets, enough dividers for my clubs with full length protection for the woods, a divider for the putter, light weight and a two strap harness that makes it easy to carry the bag. One additional feature turned out to be a disappointment. It comes with a small waterbottle and a separate pocket for it. The waterbottle became useless almost right away - the top loosened and would not stay on. I threw it away after only using it twice. The pocket for the waterbottle is small - it can't hold a 20 oz. bottle. Overall, I like the bag and the price was excellent."
2,Over Hyped!,I received this game just over a day ago and was disappointed to say the least. The best part was all the options that you have with a car. It is almost info overload. But.........the graphics are AWFUL! I have a Athon 800MHZ pc with a NVIDIA GEFORCE 2 64MB card and have the graphics set to the max. They remind me of the graphics for the first NASCAR RACING game from Papyrus. You can tell where EA cuts some corners. I would suggest NASCAR RACING 4 if you want the complete package.
1,save your money,"Basically, this is an arcade GAME, NOT anywhere close to a simulation. If you want a physics model that simulates real racing get Papyrus N2002, or wait for the N2003 in February. EA has obviously cut many corners to get this on the shelves before Christmas. Patches are needed to correct inaccurate physics and gameplay, and the multiplayer is a joke. Don't waste your money."
2,Not very good,"Usually EA is great. However, for the serious online racer, Sierra's Nascar 2003 season is really the best. I was not impressed."
1,nascar thunder 2003,"very disapointed with game.have a lot of trouble with it.cant't tune cars right.ordered nascar 2003,hope its better."
2,EA vs. Papyrus nascar series,Well to start off with thunder 2003 is another fluke from EAits just as bad as all the rest of there nascar games.if you want a real race sim . You need to look no further than any papyrus nascar racing series .o yea for you dale fan'she was the spokesman for papy untill ea bought him out (What a sell out)
4,This book is true to Johnstone's horror formula!,"THE DEVIL'S CAT sets up the characters and situations we've come to expect from Johnstone. Demons, zombies, and killer felines all make their way into this one. Sometimes the novel seemed bogged down with too many characters, but I found it a satisfying conclusion to the series. It's just as addictive as ever!"
4,A sequel to Cat's Cradle,The two main charaters who barely survived the last book return in this sequel. They only make a token appearance in the book and really have a more supportive role here then in the first book.The story is somewhat fast paced as the badly burned main bad girls are put on the side lines and mostly secondary charaters are used to carry the story and attempt to bring about the destruction of mankind again.I would only recommend this book to die-hard William W Johnstone fans as this is not up to his normal pare in his story telling.
5,THIS IS A GEM,THIS MOVIE IS PART SOUTH GOTHIC PART DISFUCTION FAMILY DRAMA GREENE IS A TEEN BOY ON THE CUSP OF MANHOOD TRYING TO PROTECT HIS YOUNGER BROTHER AND HIS PITIFUL MOTHER WHO CAN'T SEEM TO GET OUT OF HER OWN WAY LET ALONE RAISE HER TWO SON'S.

4,lightened up my day,I have an obsession with Hal Sparks. That is what drew me to this film. It's a sweet story and I actually found myself drawn in. Much better than I thought it would be
4,Great insight!,"Great read, although quite a bit ""folksy"" at times. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is the first half of the book is chronological, and the second half isn't. Had the entire book been chronological, this would have been five stars for me."
5,My Respect Went Up,"I loved this book. Although I had heard bits and pieces of Reagan's biography, this put it all together in the president's own words. My respect for him, which was always great, went up."
5,AMERICAN LIFE,"EXCELLENT BOOK. WELL WRITTEN AND EASY TO READ. FOUND OUT THINGS ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT REAGAN I DID NOT WORK. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE,ESPECIALLY ONE WHO LIKES READING BOOKS ON HISTORY"
3,A very readable autobiograpy of a great president,"In 725 pages Mr. Reagan tells a story of growing up in small town America from humble beginnings thru the presidency. The chapters are relatively short, each one an interesting story and written in a very readable style. This was a page turner for me and I could hardly stop reading. This book is all the more valuable as an autobiography, as Mr. Reagan's present illness set-in shortly after the end of his Presidency so we will likey not to be able to read any further works written by him. He discusses subjects from early politices, the California governorship and affairs of state during his presidency, his meetings with Mr. Gorbachev and its impact on the fall of Communisum in Russian, the tearing down of the Berlin wall and much more. Few people doubt that Mr. Ronald Reagan was indeed a great president, probably one of our greatest. This book will help you understand the man."
3,Readable,"I grew up during the Reagan presidency. As a generation X-er, many things seem to have imprinted on me only to be forgotten later on. This book is a good reminder. But apart from getting to know Ronald Reagan better as a person and the walk down 80s memory lane, I find it a bit sight. It's eminently readable and engaging, but doesn't plunge to the depth of the issues like one would hope."
5,Never a Fan,"I was never a supporter of Ronald Reagan, but I found that this autobiography gave me a glimpse of a different man than I imagined. The first section was an easy read and showed how much the President needs to work with Congress. Made me feel that the House of Representatives is the most important vote a citizen can make. I might add that for several years I have been reading biographies of the Presidents from George Washington on. It's been an interesting project. I would rank this book among the top ten."
2,Did Reagan write a word of this?,"A book obviously ghostwritten to such an extent it is difficult to imagine Reagan wrote a word of it. (Especially with the senility and Alzheimers he was obviously suffering from at this period in his life). As a political memoir it is vague and lacks detail (any military action the US takes is simply to ""save them from communism"").This is more interesting as autobiography but seeing as it is so heavily ghostwritten it cannot even be judged as reliable or honest even on that level."
1,"No Craft, No Style, No Pop","This book of what they call ""poetry"" nowadays is rife with loose limping lines of free verse at its worst. ""Can poetry matter?"" as the venerable Dana Gioia once asked the literary intelligentsia of America. With this book full of inchoate imagination, the reading public can be certain that the author's work will not matter in the short and long-term of American poetry. For the true guts of Hip Hop Poetry, one must turn to the masters of the craft like Roger Bonair-Agard, Regie Cabico, or Khalil Amani."
4,works well in a therapeutic setting,This toy is well designed for both fun and teaching. This was bought for a Mental Health Center and it works well for our Early Childhood program
5,"Sorry it took so long, but that's life","Yet another gem from Peg Mayo's pen, about important issues. It took a while to excavate her book from my packing crates, but once again, I was in awe of what she wrote. Currently, I live in Oregon's smallest nursing home, helping my parents with end-of-life issues. Surreal is a good word for it. Peg Mayo's book is a MUST BUY. Unless you think you'll never die, or face Death with a smile."
4,Nice to be reminded,"Once upon a time, there was such a thing as courage. It was at the center of all our stories. Now there are no more stories worth telling and all human beings are weak. At least we still have the stories and this book has some great ones, and true. For example, there's the one about the American GI on the Italian front who ""charged"" an enemy position on one knee and the stump of his other leg, shot off at the knee."
2,DULL,"Yes, we've all heard what hard work (no pun intended) making porn films is---that is a difficult job to remain excited and involved while the cameras are rolling. We've also heard about, and seen the evidence of, drugs in the world of porn. But who would have thought that the porn industry would prove as dull as work on a conveyer belt? Probst's book shows us this boredom in his, otherwise, excellent photographs. The story by A. M. Homes which serves as the book's introduction is merely pretentious."
5,Great Gift,"I purchased this book for my daughter. She is an advanced metals major in college and was absolutely thrilled with this book. She was familiar with the work of the author and was very pleased to have detailed instruction as well as wonderful photographic examples of her work. If you are looking for great gift for an art major, you can't go wrong with this book."
5,Top Enameling Book,"This is a great book. Has lots of step-by-step pictures, very detailed, goes through all the equipment etc. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is serious about enamel jewellery."
5,The Art of Enameling a good introduction to enameling,"The Art of Enameling is a great intro into the world of enameling. It gives you a good basic overview of the art form, as well as provides practical tips and step-by-step instructions on using different techniques and processes. I am a beginner enamelist and have found this book to help me with both technical expertise and creative inspiration. I definitely recommend it."
5,Outstanding Enameling Book!,"I have three or four other enameling books. This book is the best by far. The things that make it great are the wonderful tips, clear descriptions, sharp photos and interesting projects. Everyone I show this book to goes out and buys a copy for themselves."
5,Very Helpful,What a wonderfull reference to have on hand when enameling. This is a great book for first timers as well as those that have been doing it for a while. Step by step instructions and illustrations make the book easy to follow and understand.
5,Another favorite!,"This is one of my favorite publications on enameling. The illustrations alone help you to develop an affection for artists that inspire you (my are Marilyn Druin, Ricky Frank, William Harper, Kristin Anderson, and the author herself Linda Darty). Beautiful illustrations, understandable basic instruction, and solid information are key factors in valuable keepsake artisan books. This one will never collect dust, it will be cherished often."
4,Love it,"This is a great magazine with good articles. Gear'd mostly towards the everyday pet owner though it does on occassion cover breeding of more ""known"" species. I would love to see more exotic breeds of parrots, finches, etc. I usually seek out BirdTimes if I want to learn about more scientific facts and more exotic birds."
2,Lots of advertisements! Little information&#65533;,"If you are looking for a magazine and have low expectations. A magazine with a few cute photos, with very basic (VERY) information then you may want to read a copy of this as well as a few others produced by this same publisher.I cannot stress any more that the information contained within these pages are BASIC! If you know that parrots have hard beaks then I can honestly say that you will probably read this magazine in 5 min flat.DO NOT take the blind advice through advertisements on what to feed your bird. Find someone knowledgably in the subject. It will make the difference between your bird living 40% of its life span and 100%."
5,A must for every Bird Owner,Many years ago I subscribed to Bird Talk for my Cockatiel that I had for 25 years. Recently I purchased a new Green Cheek Conure and wanted to learn more information about the caring and raising of a Conure and birds in general. I started last july y subscription to Bird Talk and read everything. It is an excellent source of information for every current and possible new bird owner. Each and very issue is a pleasure to read and I highly recommend it to everyone.
5,Good all-around 'zine,"Been reading this magazine for a while. It contains articles on specific concerns for, and methods of dealing with anything from avian diet, behavioral problems, species-specific care, choosing a bird, avian hygiene, emotional problems, outdoor and indoor enclosures, toy ideas, treats, and laws for bird owners to be aware of. This magazine is not only for parrot owners, but finch and canary enthusiasts as well."
1,BirdTalk Magazine-- CLOSED SHOP!,"BirdTalk magazine has closed shop, so I am quite stunned they are still taking orders for subscriptions, that's called fraud!"
5,Every Bird owner should read,"I am a proud owner of a 5 year old African Gray Parrot. This magazine not only has great educational material on all species of birds but there are inspirational stories of parrot saviors, funny pictures and great offers. If you own a bird then you should treat yourself to this wonderful magazine"
2,Still waiting~~~~~,"I can't give an honest review yet, however, it has been a while since i placed my order, & i haven't received anything from anyone....... unless you count the bill, LOL!The magazine service provider seems lack promptness... or, who knows, they may have went under in this economy!Looking forward to getting the BIRDTALK magazine, when & if it should ever arrive!"
5,A must have for parrot owners and bird lovers,"When you have parrots, you can never have too much information. Especially new parrot owners should have at least one year of this magazine. It's full of articles on behavior, medical issues, fun stories, and serious conservation issues. I especially like the behavior articles. They have excellent authors like Mattie Sue Athan, Bobbi Brinker and a host of other well known authors, breeders and bird owners. I have a Macaw, Cockatoo and African Grey - and I have pulled back issues of Bird Talk many a time to find things out like ""why is he doing that?"" or ""should he be doing this?"" It especially helped when my parrot was beginning to act aggressive, I found out from Bird Talk that this tends to happen when they are moulting. So make sure you get your info, you won't be sorry."
1,"If you and your bird are both grown-ups, don't bother...","As another reviewer pointed out, everything is about baby birds. If you acquire a bird as an adult, this magazine will only frustrate you.They offer basic information to get the beginner started, assuming they are buying a baby, but a serious bird owner will outgrow this magazine in about a year.If you and your bird have made it through adolescence, and you feed pellets/fresh fruits/veggies/fresh water daily, keep a clean environment and don't use non-stick cookware/aerosols/etc. you've probably already outgrown it.And Bird Talk is geared toward inexperienced pet bird owners, not breeders. Breeding is far too advanced for the audience that this magazine is directed to, so they touch very lightly on it, offering nothing that a breeder wouldn't already know."
5,Favorite Magazine,"This is ""The Magazine"" for anyone who loves pet birds. I've enjoyed it for years. The center-page pictures are beautiful."
5,Great Bird Lover's Magazine!,"This is a wonderful resource for any exotic bird owner. I love the articles and the advertisements are a great way to find discounted toys and bird-needs both locally and online. The only thing I find fault with in the magazine is the blatant spelling errors that are peppered throughout the magazine. However, this should not deter you from buying this great resource!"
3,Still waiting to receive first issue,"I like the magazine in general, but I still haven't received the first issue. It's been a month since the order was placed. I'm sure it will be enjoyed if it is ever received."
3,Baggallinis complete cosmetic bag,"I bought 2 of these (one is rip stop & it is stronger) for our intensive care nursery. We use them for emergency supplies, drugs etc. to take to high risk infant deliveries. This is the third set of baggallini's I have purchased. Unfortunately these don't have the double zipper for locking medications, so we will have to adapt them somehow. Also, the material doesn't seem as strong, so when these wear out, I will probably be looking for another bag. But everyone loves the vibrant colors."
1,Not as represented,"The bag as shown has a velcro closure for the handles. No velcro closure. It was advertised as the original Baggalini, but it has less storage inside. The one that was delivered the zipper was ripped on the interior. Save you rmoney, buy something else. I returned it."
4,Wife likes it.,"Got it for my wife and it holds her cosmetics. She likes how it has a built in hook so she can hang it on the back of the door or towel rack. She didn't think all her stuff from her old bag would fit, but it did!"
1,Bagallini Cosmetic Bag Review,"Baggallini Complete Cosmetic Bagg- The Bagallini cosmetic bag is not as well made as I would expect from them! I have three of their other style bags and love them! This bag's material is thin and translucent (not their usual), and offers no padding or protection for your contents, which may be fragile. The compartments are not well thought out (too large) and are impractical or impossible to access without other items cascading elsewhere out of the bag. Access to some compartments require you to twist sections of the bag upside down while hanging (very awkward). The most annoying aspect of this bag is the single zipper tab, where two would have made more sense. It is difficult to locate and access contents quickly. The hanger is flimsy. Although I love the turquoise color I chose, I would not recommend this bag to anyone!"
3,"good, but needs more zippers and another small compartment","Like many toiletry bags; it has too large of a main compartment so that all your tiny containers of cream and potions are jumbled together and you have to dig dig dig. I know there are other pouch options within this bag, but I like to group my toiletries and the big section really only needs to be large enough for a travel hairdrier and small travel brush. If you're askin' I think the one in this bag should be divided into 2 sections. A double zipper on the main entry into the bag would have also been more helpful. It's very difficult to find a good toiletry bag. I had one last decade that was a similar layout to this and was perfect but it wore out. Alas!, this one is the closest I've yet to find. I'll keep it but I'll still keep an eye out."
5,Best Toiletry Bag Ever!,"My goodness, I love this toiletry bag. It is very well made. I won't need a new toiletry bag for at least a decade. The fabric is durable, and smudges can be wiped away with a damp towel. The bag is huge! Really, it's a lot larger than I expected it to be. Plenty of room for absolutely all your toiletry items. I took it on a cruise, and used the built in hanger over the towel rack. It saved space, and the clear compartments made finding any item a breeze. The exterior pockets are great for easy accessibility and storage of last-minute items. Buy this toiletry bag. Do it now!"
5,Pure Pop For NOW People,"Thank god for Outrageous Cherry. This is fantastic, sunny, Nuggets-era pop that makes me smile like no other band. I recently saw them on tour and was overjoyed at their sound. Thank you, Outrageous Cherry, for keeping the power pop alive."
2,Maybe in 2002 this mag was good...,"I love getting subscriptions, and was excited about this one. I'm a 25 yr old girl btw. I get 2 others, and this one has the MOST ADS. There's almost nothing in it... it seems like 75% ads, and fluffy articles where I don't feel like I learn anything new whatsoever.So, it's pretty boring, and I've been leaving mine for people at my gym. Or using it as a doorstop :) I would try a different one if I were you."
2,Allure is annoying,"Allure has a tendency to portray underweight young models when writing about anti-aging products, has very little makeup advice for non-white women (well, try finding a face in this mag that isn't caucasian and looks 19), and has a predictable cycle of issues. This issue features ""starlets"" that you've never heard of naked! This issue has our worthless best of lists crammed with products from the brands that gave our editors the most free loot! Don't even get me started on the fluffy features with celebrities who I don't care about or the annoying how-to section. In a world of independant beauty blogs that aren't afraid to trash a product, Youtube channels owned by pro-makeup artists, and skincare sites run by practicing dermatologists, Allure seems like a waste of paper and good money."
3,if you ever get your purchase,Ordering magazines is tempting because it is cheap..but unless you are prepared to order them for a planned out gift do not bother. i ordered allure (which is one of my favorites) over a month and a half ago and it still hasnt showed. its really not that hard to send one magazine to someone. they should give some sort of consolation. oh well..i guess it is back to the news stands and getting ripped off. ....if you ever get the chance to go to a fashion magazine..tear out all the double sided adds. you will have about 45 pages of real articles. BOO~
4,Allure is a the least offensive of beauty mags!,"My daughter likes fashion/make-up magazines & I struggle to find magazines that don't always focus on the ""Snookie"" & Kardashian profile. It's not perfect, but it has a clearer focus on make-up & fashion versus the gossip & promotion of premarital & promiscuous sex, not to mention, the degradation of our young girls/women."
1,"Hmmm, Disappointing","I am almost up with my subscription of Allure and overall was not impressed with the magazine. I think the best thing about the magazine were the coupons and samples you sometimes find inside. I prefer Cosmopolitan a lot more (as it is more well rounded). Most of the stuff they focus on in the magazine is brand named and too pricey, and it just seems a bit shallow (the last two have had articles on plastic surgery). I bought the magazine for the makeup tips and it's just disappointing (youtube has better stuff than this did)! I will not be missing this magazine when the subscription ends!"
5,Good magazine,Allure turned out to be a very good magazine - I have enjoyed many well written articles and nice reviews of products and clothing. There are many tips and advice on a variety of things that any woman would certainly enjoy. It is a very well done magazine and enjoyable to read.
2,What's the allure?,I canceled my subscription after a few years....the magazine has turned into little more then advertisements.
4,Great magazine,"I'm a 16-year-old girl who finds most teen magazine not to my liking... luckily, I've found Allure! I'm a big beauty junkie and a conossieur of high end brands (I favor MAC, Nars, BeneFit, Urban Decay, Chanel, among others). This publication provides lots of beauty and fashion info. I also really love the in-depth essays, especially the ones questioning what beauty really is. If you're a fashionista/beauty queen you really need to subscribe!!!"
4,great beauty magazine,"I am not a fan of Cosmopolitan or Glamour - They may have tips on how to get some, but the tips you really need to get some is to look gorgeous and Allure will definitely tell you how. From the best department store products to affordable with same result suggestions. How to take care of your hair, how to take care of your mood, body, etc. I love this magazine."
1,not for my age group,The allure magazine is not what I expected and looking to cancel the subscription I am 46 year old female and the articles are more geared for females in there 20's- 30's Looking for a magazine more into this phase of my life
1,Ugh!!! Who prints this drivel?!,"For a magazine that prints ""the beauty expert"" on every cover,Allure is quite ambitious. With every issue (I got the subscription as a gift) I am more sure of the fact that this is one of the worst fashion magazines out there, as far as looks go. The layouts are so hideous, that alone makes me wary of taking any of their beauty advice. Try flipping through an issue and you'll understand why I find this magazine difficult to read or follow. With a plethora of messy crayon-style arrows, crowded pages, and clashing colors, I never fail to be astounded that some ppl actually find the magazine stylish. For a far better investment, try subscribing to InStyle instead - now there's a magazine worth looking forward to!"
5,Best beauty mag.,"I love this magazine. If you're into makeup, then subscribe to this. Amazon has a great price!!! I look forward to this every month. Great articles and lots of makeup!!! It'll show you makeup techniques and compare products. They let you know the makeup trends and hot new products. This is my favorite magazine by far. Its not just makeup either, they've got hair tips and all kinds of awesome things."
5,SIMPLY SPECTACULAR,"Canadian sensation Elissa is back with a new single ""Mamboleo"" which is very very good. Plus it includes her latest freestyle hit ""Back To Me."" Her upcoming track is ""The Light"" which is also fantastic!!!! She has released over 22 songs on compilations!!!"
5,funny book,"I just think this book is one of the funniest books, I have read in a long time. I can just picture some of the things described in the book and really had a great time reading it. I take the Regional Transit everyday except weekends and I know some of those people thought I lost my mind, because I would burst out laughing. That happened with one other book MARLEY AND ME. I read the second book, it wasn't as funny, not saying it did not have some funny parts. b"
3,"They shoot books like these, don't they?","The writing bobber just seems to float on these ""outdoorsy"" tales from McManus. No hook, line and sinker for this reader. The tackle box is not full.Yes, there may be a few witty moments of hunting and fishing adventures but overall the text and phrasing could have been more approachable.Seems as though the author tried too hard to be amusing."
3,pretty funny,"I didn't think this book was quite as funny as A Fine and Pleasant Misery, but I still enjoyed it. I get a kick out of reading humorous literature about the outdoors, however, I'm not really into hunting and fishing, two activities that McManus spends a lot of time on. I mostly enjoy the stories about camping, hiking, and general wilderness survival."
1,they shoot canoes dont they,"Well, when it comes to books they, aren't my thing. you see, I don't like to read but when I read the book They Shoot Canoes Don't They by Patrick F Mcmanus, now I like to read a little bit better. The book is about this guy Patrick Mcmanus. He tells these little stories about what stupid things he has done and or this that have happed to him or his friends and family. Like this one little story his wife goes through the garage tossing junk in the garbage and she finds this one box with his childhood memories and the he tells a little story about what happened. It all starts when he first meets his wife and he takes her hunting. She puts on his antler tag as a bracelet and can't get it off then he tells a different, story but Ill leave the rest for you to find out what happens.Travis Knipfer"
4,quick and easy,"Worked like a charm. I needed it for a Volvo roof rack, and its now permanently residing in the glove box."
2,poor fit and holder clips break during install,"External fit is poor between two halves of case, also the mounting hardware for the bow and arrow holders break when installing. other wise seems to be a decent protective case."
3,It gets the job done. Nothing else.,"I bought this because of the price and its what you would expect. Its heavy, long and bulky, but at least it protects your bow."
5,Transational!,"This is a sonic trance banquet - one incredible track after another! If you're even remotely interested in hearing the next wave of trance, this is the disc to have. One of the best purchases I've made in a long time!"
4,SO OVERRATED,"read the subject. I like this game but only because of the nostalgia. The games on here are boring. the control consists of button mashing, and pinpoint accuracy and perfect hand eye coordination. I think maybe someone with a robotic targeting system in their eyes may enjoy this. Hey no offense to midway, I mean they just HAD to bring these to the console. But the game is too hard for someone using a PS12 controller. The 3 lives thing really makes me mad, when i get so far in a game but then lose all my lives just makes me want to slide this disc on the driveway. But don't let me influence you, try it for yourself."
3,What looks like gold does not glitter like it.,"Good to average material here. Graphics are little light at times to see clearly. Maybe if I had a larger screen television, the graphics would be better compensated. Disc comes with a lot of material or games but I personally only play about half of them.More obscure games than what I used to enjoy; however, some people may enjoy that because they may not be offered with any other package disc like this one. The price was also reasonably fair for all of these games.Navigating through this disc was quite different than others I have used; however, with lots of games comes several different steps or levels to pursue."
3,Limited to nostalgia,"First, please note that this game DOES NOT include Moon Patrol! I bought it for that game. Hopefully the Amazon site will update the description.Some of the games are still fun 20 years later, but some are just so dated that it's hard to get into them. The graphics are REALLY lame compared to today! But of course, we buy this for nostalgia value, and that is what you get. As far as I can tell, these are perfect replica's of the 80's games.Great time killers and no more losing fist fulls of quarters!"
4,bad paperboy,"Paper Boy was always one of my favorite games (and the reason I purchased this disk). I admit that there is still alot of great games on this disk worth playing (like Sinistar, rampage, Joust), but I was really dissapointed because Paper Boys controls were horrible. I really enjoyed the sega version and found the controls good, so I was surprised that the arcade version controls were so bad.Otherwise all the other games look and work great. If you want to re-live the old Starcade days, purchase this collection."
4,"Paperboy, Marble Madness, and other classics",This collection of games is fun if you want to be taken back to the days when video games were only a quarter! Several classic titles in this set. Amazon.ca is the only place I have seen this for sale. Pick it up. Great price performer. Fun for younger kids too.
4,A Summer Charmer,"Ann Breen Metcalfe has done a wonderful job capturing the flavor of a small town where the locals and summer people frequently conflict in her ""Trout Lake"" novel of the Adirondacks. She manages to build suspense while combining several plots and subplots, which revolve around various secrets that have been kept for years. At the same time that those secrets are gradually revealed, Metcalfe introduces us to a vivid cast of characters who are quite believeable. She has a knack for providing the telling detail, both in her descriptions of Trout Lake with its natural beauty and in her portraits of the various personalities who make up her novel.Once I started reading ""Trout Lake"" I couldn't put it down, eager to learn the answer to mysteries such as why the billionaire was so reclusive for so long and just who was handing out musty $100 bills to certain residents of the community. I recommend ""Trout Lake"" for its charm, suspense and topnotch writing."
5,Good book on tea,This is a lovely little book that will be useful for people learning about tea. I bought it as a gift for someone who expressed an interest in learning about types of teas and tea service and she loved it.
2,Damaged Book,"The book was sold under the pretense""Like New"".It was not,over 1/2 of the book was fluid or water damaged on the lower R corner.However when I got the pages unstuck the Book was very informative about Tea from a novice level."
3,Look for newer edition,The 2008 updated edition is now available with 30 new teas photographed and reviewed. The world of tea information has changed tremendously over the past four years and the 2008 edition is more up-to-date than the 04 and 05 editions.The New Tea Companion
4,A Decent Overview,"Jane Pettigrew covers just about everything in the tea world in this book, from a little history to a taste of the different kinds of tea from their own regions.I was a bit disappointed that Puerh tea was not given more attention in the book, but this is also the older version and when it was published there wasn't much availability of Puerh in the US yet.There are a lot of pretty pictures in this book, and it's this imagery that wins the reader over. I also like how tea from individual estates in places like Assam and Ceylon is described."
3,A simple story about an ordinary happy family,"This is the kind of simple story about ordinary happy families that I read in bulk as a child. (I remember reading this particular story, in fact.) Rachel and Jerry are brother and sister, living with their mom and dad in a quiet little town. Jerry wants a dog, but he knows it is nearly impossible for him to earn the dollar he needs in time to buy the dog.Lo and behold, an opportunity to earn money avails itself to Jerry and, before he knows it, he is the proud owner of Ginger, a brilliantly clever dog. But, alas, others learn of Ginger's brilliance.Ginger disappears. The rest of the book is devoted to searching for Ginger. And that's the whole book.No family turmoil. No dysfunctional people. Everyone in the story seems, well, focused and kind and happy and...gosh, nice. Was Estes deluding herself? Were families really like this? Are most families like this now? One can always hope."
4,A great dog book!,"Ginger Pye is a book about two kids named Jerry and Rachel Pye and their dog Ginger. One day Ginger wondered where Jerry and Rachel go every morning so he sniffed out their trail and followed them to school. Awhile later Ginger is stolen on Thanksgiving day. Jerry, Rachel, and kids from school look for Ginger. After looking and looking they finally find him on Jerry's birthday which is in the summer. In the end, the Pyes and their dog are reunited and everybody is happy. I recommend this book if you like mysteries because Ginger is stolen and needs to be found. If you don't like books about pets and their owners than I don't recommend this book. Alexis H."
3,Great and then good,"The book captivated me at the start, but as the search for Ginger Pye went on and on and on and on and on the book became only good. The end was way too long. However, I enjoyed ""listening"" to the children and dog ""think""."
5,This book is very enjoyable!!!!!,"Ginger Pye is such a cute book. I just finished reading it and I just thought it was so great. I recommend it to ages 8-13! Great fo all ages, really. If you liked this book, you should also read The Moffats by the same author. Great book, highly recommended."
5,This book is incredibly heartwarming,"It all begins in a barn. Jerry Pye and his sister Rachel, want the cute fox terrier in a friends' barn. They must earn a whole dollar for it! Finally, they get it, and it is theirs. A month later, he disappears. I think the author MUST have had a pet run away once because she discribes well the pain of losing a pet. No doubt about it, 2 thumbs WAY up!"
3,Not my favorite--long winded,"I read this to my children because it appears on some of the homeschool book recommendation lists. It was okay--the kids seemed to enjoy it. (They are 5-9.) The author describes events and places in painful detail and the story, in my opinion, lacks cohesion. There is a lot of extra that doesn't really add anything to the story. As an adult, I knew who had Ginger before she was taken, the clues were so obvious. We are reading Understood Betsy now, and I find that it has much more to offer."
1,This book isn't very exciting...,"Ginger Pye is a book about two kids, Jerry and Rachel. They want to buy a puppy and this book is about the adventures they had with the puppy. Unfortunately, the puppy gets stolen. This book was O.K. until it got to the part where the dog was stolen. The kids obviously aren't very intelligent, because they can't put the simplest ideas together and they are very stubborn. Another thing is that everything is so perfect and they have no challenges. For example, When Jerry wants to earn a dollar, IT JUST SO HAPPENS that the next day, Sam Doody wants to buy a suit and can't dust the pews. It seems that I am outnumbered in my thinking, but I didn't really like this book"
2,A dog barks at a cat,"It is a book about a dog. A cat liked a dog because he doesn't do dog things like bark at night,howl,beg and run away!There is a big suprise!I read some of the book so far and I liked it, so will you!"
3,"well written, but the children over-look LOTS of clues...","This book is mostly about a brother and a sister whose dog disappears, while still a puppy. They spend most of the book wondering who took their dog and looking for their dog.I had a hard time with the clues that they over-looked, as they were supposed to be intelligent children!Other than that, it was an enjoyable read. There is a tiny amount of religion in the book, and the little girl prays to god for the dog to come home. Going to church is viewed positively by the author. As an agnostic, it bothered me a little. Just a little.I read the book aloud to my 7 and 10 and they both enjoyed the story much more than I did."
1,"A nice attempt, but ...","This would have made a nice five page book for todlers, but that would mean taking out all of the pointless junk in the middle. So sad. Really, this writer only broke one rule... quality not quantity. Edit, Edit, Edit, my dear! Too many times the plot wandered into points where it could have ended, yet Ms. Estes just couldn't put down that pencil."
1,It should be called BOOOOORING.,"Uhhh, puh-lease. Okay, maybe a little kid who was like, 3 would like it, but older kids will find themselves snoring away. I had to read this book for school. It is about two unintelligent little kids who get a dog. They lose the dog. They are sad. They can't figure out who took the dog. The dog comes back. Whoop-dee-doo. End. Ya see? I could have written this book better. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!! EVER!!!"
1,The Worst Book Ever!,"This book should have never been printed. It's a waste of paper. I mean come on, whoever liked this book has really bad problems. The book is about two boring kids with pointless lifes that can't get a dog. Then, they get the ""Smart Dog of their dreames "".(Pretty stupid dog if you ask me.)As soon as they get it, like 2 chapters later those morons loose the dog. Then for the rest of the book they are trying to find it. They look in the dumbest places like a house.Then they find the rat at a circus. Who cares!Like I said before, it's a waste of paper."
5,Ginger Pye,"Ginger Pye is about 2 kids-Rachel and Jerrry Pye. Both of them want to get a puppy. Rachel and Jerry decide to get a white and brown fox terrier. But Rachel and Jerry noticed that ever since they got their puppy, a guy with a yellow hat has been following them. Soon, after Thanksgiving, Ginger dissapears. But finally, the next year, when Ginger is grown up, they find him. And the Pyes find out that it was Wally Bullwinkle, ( who was Rachel and Jerry's friend), was the one who took Ginger. When they got Ginger back, everything was settled and back to normal.I would give Ginger Pye a rating of 5 stars. It keeps my attention and the characters are easy to picture in my head. The whole story is nicely descriptive. I also like how mysterious it is at some parts and makes you want to keep turning the pages. All of the words are easy to pronounce and understand. The chapters are fairly long, and the whole book is great."
4,Ginger Pie,This is a story about a boy named Jerry. One day he walks down the streets and finds new born dog babies. Jerry really wants the baby dog but he needs a new job to pay for the dog he wants to buy. As soon as Jerry gets enough money for the dog he buys it and he names the dog Ginger Pie. A few days later the dog gets lost. Jerry is very worried. Will Jerry find Ginger Pie or will Ginger Pie find Jerry?READ THIS BOOK TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENDS!!!
2,A lot of filler but little story.,I read this to my daughter every night before bed. It was struggle. The story is disjointed and broken. The main story would get 2 or 3 paragraphs then you would be subject to 7-10 paragraphs of some flashback or tangent.Eventually I would just skip the fluff and get right to the story and you know what? My daughter and I didnt miss a thing
4,Ginger Pye,"Ginger Pye is a good book. It is about a brother and a sister whose names are Jerry and Rachel. They have a two year old uncle named Bennie. Jerry wants a dog from Speedy Farm. He buys the dog with a hard earned dollar. The puppy is very smart and playful. Most of the neighborhood loves Ginger, but there are a few who do not because they are jealous of Jerry. I like the book because it is very well writen. A critisism would be that the author gives more information than needed. She also tells about things in the past that do not have much importance."
4,Civil War Delight.,"To a Civil War buff, the story of the Hunley is irresistable. The book begins with the conception and execution of the ""fish boat"" in Mobile and continues with its introduction into service in Charleston. The book then interweaves the distant past with the very recent past, telling the tale of the boat's crews (3 crews, none who answered to 'Lucky') and the tale of the multiple personalities involved in raising her some 135 years later. The writing is only adequate; the story of the boat and her design is more interesting reading than that of her crew and her salvagers. Nonetheless, this is an enjoyable book that can easily be read in one (pleasant) day."
3,Submarine,"Very interesting, but needs updating as investigation has continued with new information on how Hunley was sunk.Got to give a lot of credit to those who served and built Hunley. This comes from New London, CT where we know about submarines and how difficult their task was during the Civil War. These guys were heros for sure. Really advanced technology for the day."
1,Narrator detracts from story in audio format,The Narrator has a sing song voice which would be more appropriate if he were reading the lyrics to Shirley Temple's rendition of The Good Ship Lollipop.His attitude comes through as the Narrator does not seem to take the Civil War seriously. He refers to the Union and Confederacy as if they were merely rival football teams.One is left with the impression he considers the material meaningless and thus he must inject artificial emphasis to make it seem meaningful.Thankfully the new Audible policy made returning this audiobook simple. No questions asked.
2,Best of from 1993 and Beyond,"The sad truth is that Soul Asylum is not the band on this album. They may have become the band on this album but for almost 15 years they were a much better and more complete band. Success came after ...the horse they rode in on and Hang Time, but for me their peak was much earlier with Made To Be Broken and While You Were Out, both of which albums were left out.Never forget that Soul Aslyum started in 1979 as Loud Fast Rules and then changed their name to Soul Aslyum because they didnt want to be seen as a HC band.And where are the Time's Incinerator songs? How many people even know about this album? Its too bad that Sould Asylum will be thought of as a 90s bad because they are so much more than that."
3,"Good overview, if only for later albums","While not being a complete history, Black Gold does help the casual fan by including all of the hits and help the more interested person sift though their sub-par later material while including a couple of hard to finds. This is by no means a best of, however, because there is a lot of great early material missing. Almost nothing from Clam Dips and two tracks from Hangtime are included making this a good starting point but by no means an ending point for the more interested fan."
2,Doesn't Showcase Their Best stuff,"Let's be honest. Soul Asylum isn't the greatest band in the world. But there was a time when they were respected. After ""Let Your Dim Light Shine"" they fell off the face of the Earth. Unlike many bands who didn't deserve it, after listening to these cuts, these guys kinda do. The only saving graces from this album are the tracks from ""Grave Dancer's Union"". What they shoulda done is included:Eyes of a ChildThe Sun MaidCrawlNothin to Write Home About99%New World"
1,Don't make me laugh!!,"No - Say what you will- Made to be broken- While You Were Out (Their Best)- Clam dip and other delightsSoul asylum were once part of the trinity which included the mats and the huskers, but now they are just a joke"
1,Stretches the contours of evangelical intepretation,"Goldingay holds that the book of Daniel, and its prophecies, were written after the events actually occured, significantly stretching the defintion of ""prophecy,"" not to mention the doctrines of inerrancy and infallibility.The layout of the Word Biblical Commentary series is like a puzzle that needs solving before the reader can find what they're looking for. Frankly, its frustrating. Sections pertaining to the historical context of Daniel keep this book from receiving zero stars. Recommendation: Pass on this one."
2,Good Commentary,Goldingay does a great job in his commentery giving the ready pleanty of material for study and scripture expounding.
4,Lots n Lots X 5,Lots of amazing business cards for you to drool over. A great reference book for the graphic designer.
4,Very good!,"OK this is a realy good game but there are a few things that could be improved. I do not like writing alot so this is short but punchy, PROS. ok graphics5/5, gameplay 5/5 storyline 4/5, cars 5/5 (except the Opal! it sucks, cons. I only wish you could play free ride with police! that is all bye"
4,Cool,"I like this game. It is cool cause the cars. All the Mclarens, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Porsches, and Corvettes make this game cool. But if you play it too long, you get a headache. It is worth your money"
4,"""Attemting to overtake a vehicle at a high rated speed.""","3...2...1...GO BUY THIS GAME!!!Pros:+ be the cop mode+ cool cars+ unlike NFSU, there is a replay+ 8 person online play+ easy to control cars+ cool tracks+ awesome graphics+ realistic damage+ a lot of fun to lose cops(especially when there is a chopper in the air)+ able to chat with other players in online mode+ cheat codes are easy to find+ soundtrack has a speed-like feel+ choose your opponent only for single races against one car+ There is a Need for Speed edition on all cars except for the BMW'sCons:- McLaren F1 costs a lot- hard to win the tournament- watch out for the smoking barrels-they will make your car crash- spike strip is hard to get around- sometimes the cop cars will be faster than your car or is the same carThere is one more thing to say:BUY THIS GAME BEFORE YOU BORE YOURSELF TO DEATH!!!!!!!!! End of discussion."
1,Poor Handling. Not even a good arcade game.,I suguest you skip this game. The cars have very poor handling. There is not much in the way of setup to make the cars handle better. Beside very poor graphics the police chase does not seem realistic. If you can call it a chase the police very often come onto the road in front of your car and seem to be a lot faster.If you can find it the Jeff Gordon XS Racing is by far a better arcade game.
1,Need for Speed Porsche unleashed,I bought the Need for Speed Porsche Unleashed for my microsoft steering wheel but they are NOT compatible. I just bought several microsoft racing games to go with my new microsoft steering just to be safe.
2,VERY POOR GAME,It is incredible you can ONLY play it with Keyboard and there is no option for a Wheel or Joystick.Do not buy it !!!
2,The Graffics are cool but the game play sucks.,"I have played nfs 2 and up and I would say after three they lost there momentum. The graffics there are no better, but where is the ability to jump cliffs with the car, and hide behind the fence at the gas station. If you want a cool game expirence get Need for Speed 3, they lack some graffics but make it up with the ability to jump off a cliff and land on the police."
2,What happened!?!?,"I loved the old Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, but this one is horrable. It glitches tons. The cops are too fast and there is no way to cheat unlock cars! This game went from ""hero to zero"". Big disapointment EA!"
1,Is this a Joke?,"When I downloaded the demo and played, I felt very disappointed. This is not at all an improvement of the NFS saga. It seems that they forgot that a good game should have something more than just good graphics.The saddest thing is that they cut off the amazing physics of Porsche unleashed, hot pursuit 2 doesn't even simulate the basic behavior of a real car. I think that physics simulation is the most important thing that a game of this type should care most.If you are just a kid, I think that there is a very good chance that you would like the game. But if you are a person who knows how a car should behave, you should buy Porsche Unleashed."
1,A Let Down,"Not worth the wait. Game stutters, even on high-end systems. Controls a step down from Porsche Unleashed. Only consolidation is the graphics quality."
4,This game must have a patch to work good.,I wrote an earlier review of this game. In that review I said the game was no good. I had been to the EA web site looking for a patch. Ea said they had no patch. After looking at a lot of reviews of the game I found there was a patch for Need For Speed Hot Pursuit2 and it was put out by EA sports. I use a wirless game control and my control would not center until I downloaded the patch. If you are using a wheel or a game pad make sure you have the patch. When I tried the game with the patch it made all the difference. The game is now fun to play.
5,A WONDERFUL HEALING TOOL,"As a Reiki teacher and practitioner I am always looking for music suitable for the healing environment. This CD fills the bill. I set up a program for each client comprised of cuts form this CD and adjust them as the healing process continues. Quite by accident I discovered that ""Woomfas"" is a wonderful stimulant for the base chakra if it is played under the treatment chair or treatment table. I will be years getting to know the full potential if these wonderful sounds. Thank you Iasos"
5,A Great CD for kids and families,"This is a great cd from Eric Herman. It is filled with fun catchy songs that our kids sing around the house. Our 2 year-old loves to say ""No!"" with the kids on the cd during the Elephant Song. The Dinosaur song is one of my favorites. His humor shines through in songs such as There's a Monster in My House. It is a fun cd to listen to."
5,More New Versions of Classic Songs,"In and effort to keep his classic songs available and put them on CD, Don Francisco released this second project. It features 12 of his classic songs, mostly from the 70's and 80's.This CD contains a real mix of songs, with many focusing on how we live now that we are forgiven. There are classic ballads like ""Jehoshaphat,"" ""Beautiful to Me,"" ""Balaam,"" and ""Voyage to Gennesaret."" For some challenge, we've got ""Steeple Song"" and the tongue in cheek ""Everybody Else but Me."" Encouragement comes in the form of ""There is No Condemnation,"" ""Give Your Heart a Home,"" and ""It Ain't No Sin to Get the Blues."" He does a beautiful new rendition of his wedding song ""I Could Never Promise You."" Finally, the CD closes with ""Still Your Soul in Silence"" and ""Lullaby.""Production is simple, with the focus on Don and his guitar. But fans who want these classics on CD will love it."
3,Strong cast lift this mediocre sci-fi flick,"""Same-old, same-old"" plot of aliens seeking to take over Earth and the heroes of the film who must stop the invasion make this low-budget sci-fi hard to swallow. But a strong cast (Star Trek's Walter Koenig and everyone's ""B"" movie favorite, Bruce Campbell) help lift the movie above its ho-hum existence and is, at least, worth a peek. Koenig and Campbell are astronauts who land on the moon to check out the possibility of alien life. What they find are self-thinking machines bent on hitching a ride in their spacecraft back to Earth to take over the planet, and they must do everything they can to stop them. Some plot holes and unnecessary sequences in the film are chalked up to a weak script, but Koenig has a strong presence in the film and Campbell shines as his partner, stretching his successful acting versatility that much further."
3,"Rather bad, but hilarious...","I watched this movie the first time on TV, probably a decade ago, and remembered being thrilled at the ending, as well as the fact that it had Walter Koenig (Pavel Chekov from Star Trek), but I never found the title. I ran across it recently while looking through Bruce Campbell's IMDB filmography, and recognized the plot immediately. This movie is campy, strangely acted, and absolutely hysterical if you watch it in the middle of the night. Even though it's not the height of cinematic achievement, if you are fond of either of the main actors (Bruce Campbell, particularly, is his usual, bratty self), of old-school sci-fi horror, or just like to make fun of silly movies, you'll probably enjoy this film. I, personally, was pleased to find it again, and I definately enjoyed watching it."
2,MOONTRAP Film is good quality is horrible,I have seen this movie. I bought a DVD copy. The DVD copy is from a VHS original. VHS on its BEST of all possible days was CRAP. The DVD is a basement copy. I keep hoping for a REAL release of this most interesting film. Maybe even Blu-ray. But I am not holding my breath. You MAY be able to snag a Betamax copy which at least would be viewable. The DVD from VHS will leave you badly needing vision correction.Don't waste your time or money. There is an OFF air copy out there too. It too sucks! About 25 lines of resolution. It is like trying to watch it through an old coca cola bottle. The film may not be star wars but it deserves better than this.
4,Moontrap (VHS),"Moontrap [VHS]Okay so this movie never made it to dvd I get that, but it's still worth a look by any si-fi or Bruce Campbell fan. Moontrap stars Walter Koenig from the original Star Trek series and Bruce Campbell who kicks demon butt in all the Evil Dead movies. If you can get use to the idea that Bruce is the sidekick to little Walter in this flick, you may enjoy it more. Remember, this was made in the 80's before computer graphics so some of the effects may not amaze you.It starts off with Bruce and Walter investigating a huge alien ship from the moon passing earth and they bring back a football type artifact that builds itself into a killer robot using anything handy. So of course our two heros have to go to the moon and investigate. Guess what, give up? They find a girl, a darn good looking girl in a palace on the lunar surface that helps them stop an alien invasion plot to conquer earth, maybe.I paid about $12 bucks for this movie and I think I got a pretty good deal."
5,Classic 80's sci-fi,"This is one of those 80's low budget, cheezy special effects laden movies--but I love it, and have watched it many times. Walter Koening and Bruce Campbell are superb and Campbell actually plays a serious role for once! I'm unaware of this movie officially being released on dvd. The dvd I received from another company was ""copied"" from vhs so I was disappointed. The quality was actually worse than my vhs version..So beware.."
2,Not for me..,"I'm sorry but I didn't find the humor in this movie nor did I really watch it. I just couldn't get into it. I decided to give it a go for the excellent dance scene on Youtube, but I should have just left it at that.Not really my type of movie."
2,Hellzapoppin,Copy of this film made from a terrible print. Some innovative technical tricks ahead of it's time but humor (1941) does not hold up at all.
5,Car seat,"Everyone said it was the best so I bought it. It has worked so far. The function I like best is the ease in which I can take it out of the car, using the latch system. Of course, it doesn't hurt that you can buy a Michigan Wolverine seat cover to make it respectable. GO BLUE !!"
5,so good we bought two!,"my wife and her mother rushed outand got a really crumby one for her car(i tried to stop them!)then,after a bit of research,i got a Roundabout for my carwith its lovely soft denim material,simple installationand easy strap system.Boy! was the missus jealous!how i would laugh as she struggled with her cockamammyseat system""you shoulda listerned to me!""i yelled irritatinglyuntil she begged me to stop.and after getting her to admit i was right (again!)i rewarded her with her own Roundabout seat for her carso now our little girl is happy whichever car she's in(although,for some unfathomable reason,she always prefers riding with mommy)"
5,Saved my son's life,"We were recently in a car accident and I was extremely impressed by this car seat!!!! We were hit from behind at about 45-50 mph (we were stopped) and his seat stayed put, no marks on him from the straps (I fully expected his to have SOMETHING on his body). The tether system works GREAT in our Dodge Magnum but I've always had an easy time with the installation of this seat. Now that we have to replace the seat we're looking at the Marathon because the weight limit is higher (65 lbs rather than 40 lbs) and our son is nearing 35 lbs. I would highly recommend this brand to anyone, it on the spendy side but it's an excellent, SAFE brand!"
5,Making Paper Books,I love this book. I teach reading and my students use the different ideas in this book to do projects. They really enjoy completing hands on projects and it also keep them engaged in the learning process. Another Teacher had this book and I borrowed it so much I had to buy my own.
2,New?,"I bought this item because it said ""new"" but it was not new. It had the name of the previous owner on the inside cover:("
4,Good for ideas to start with.,"This is a good book, with clear instructions. It is a good starting point for learning about mini-books and paper folding. I found going through the book thinking of different ideas in addition to those in the book. Some of the illustrations provided inspiration for subjects to cover. In all, it is a good jumping point to start from."
2,If you're looking to fill in your Segovia knowledge...,... this is a good book. But as a Segovia biography it's pretty sketchy.Segovia's own biography of his early years is only slightly better.
2,As I knew Him,"I found this book very disappointing. It was more ""name dropping"" on the author's part than any serious attempt to capture or reflect the man or the ""spirit"" of Segovia or his work. If Duarte had been a Talk Show rather than corrupting the medium of serious biography, he would have spent his entire 15 minutes plugging his own work with a very minor nod to the greatest guitarist of all time. Shame on you Mr. Duarte."
4,interesting reading,"This book belongs to every one automobilehistorian's library. A amazing story of a self-made man, a hard worker climbing up to highest levels of automobile industry. Interesting that so many of those were of German origin!"
1,I should have known better,"I just bought a new house and needed a washer in a hurry. I ran to Home Depot where the salesman assured me this was the latest and greatest. I went against my better judgement and went for it. Well, I've had it 28 days and have called for service 2 times. When washing anything heavier than a few t-shirts, it makes the most horrible racket that vibrates through the whole house. In the past I have had European front loader washers and they also vibrate but I have never heard anything this horrible before. Hopefully I can prevent someone else from having the same nightmare."
3,Smelly washing machine!,I have owned my front load LG washer for 3-1/2 years. It cleans my clothes very well but I can no longer tolerate the musty & moldy smell coming from the rubber door gasket. Bleach and other disinfectant cleaning agents do not solve the odor problem. Do not purchase a front load washer unless you want your laundry room to smell like a swamp. I am going back to a top loading machine. Buyer beware!!!P.S. This machine is also VERY loud when in the spin cycle. It sounds like a jet plane taking off from the runway.
1,Stuck at the laundromat,"We have had this machine for two years. It stopped spinning in the wash cycle. Makes a noise like it is taking off. Problem;not just anyone can work on them, the certified repair people aren't even trained on the repair of these machines. I have been without a washer for 5 weeks the repair man has come 4 times (can't wait to get that bill). I had my last washer for 30 years finally the drum rusted out. I know things are made more cheaply today but I paid a ton of money and hoped to get more than 2 years out of it before I have to spend time and money on this device. Salesman said it was the most dependable brand on the market. I have spoken to many people (at the laundromat) who have similar horror stories about their LG machines."
5,Tonka Mighty Backhoe a Success,"My son is 3 and has about a dozen construction vehicles, but none large than a few inches long, so this is his first major piece. He loves it. It is a hands on toy with moving parts allowing him to actually ""dig."" It requires some learning to use properly, and some effort to move the parts, but with some practice I think any child who really wants to can master it."
2,Spartacus and the Ten Gladiators,"This is one of those oldie movies, it's nothing like The Spartacus movie with Kirk Douglas. This video is made up of big muscles and no brains type movie. Daw !"
4,Very helpful for doing homework.,I found this book had a lot of the homework from Shames book. Since I was using this book that was perfect.
3,"Great source of problems, not much of a study guide.","This book doesn't help you learn fluids, but does have tons of problems. Better off sticking with the outlines if you are struggling in a fluids class."
