1,Too bad so sad,"Like everyone else it seems the item I got was also defective and did not work. Only the rotation and nothing else. Not the fan, not the heater. BOO!"
1,3 out of 3 did not work.,"3 out of 3 did not work. Either there was a huge manufacturing error since none of the fans nor the heating elements turned on, these were already previously returned products that were inoperable, or the directions were not clear enough to decode the operating instructions. Whatever the case, we bought three, none of the three worked and we returned all three."
2,NOT a practitioners guide,"I'm feeling very frustrated with this book, and here's why. The text contains sample questions, and directs to a website for the solutions. The website requires registration in order to access the material. After filling out the necessary details, I received an email from the publisher stating that I did not qualify as I am not a lecturer. I pointed out that the text claims to be a practitioners guide, not a lecturers guide. After numerour emails back and forth I've given up - I'll return it instead.Most curiously I was never offered to purchase the material, so I can't even feel conned - just pissed-off."
5,Real Options,"The book satisfies someone who is interested in alternative concepts on how whether widely accepted view of calculating the estimate of future project or ROA gives more precise estimation.Good graphs, easy to read but good to know simple concepts like SML and CAPM model before reading the book"
4,"Really cute. Bib goes on the bear, not the doll.","Bought this for my first kid years ago. It's still being used and is still in great shape.FYI, there really is no choking hazard here, unless they now include something other than what's shown in the photo (identical to our toy). It's all soft, there are no removable or tiny parts, so I don't know why they have the 3+ warning. Since squeak/crinkle/rattle features are for infants, the warning is likely an error.Our only complaint is that the accessories included are for the doll's bear, not the doll herself. All three of my kids were frustrated by this, trying to put the bib on the doll and it wouldn't fit, or cover the doll with the tiny blanket, until I (or a big sister) showed them that the things were for the bear, not the baby.Other than that, they enjoy wearing the backpack/baby carrier and keeping the doll's treasures and their own inside."
1,Do waste your money,"I really enjoy Norah Jones. This CD was so bad I still haven't listened to the whole CD. Who wants the listen to the same 5 songs preformed 5 different ways? Most of the remixes are hip hop, not really Norah Jones' style. The best part of this CD is the cover artwork. If I could I would give this CD 0 stars"
3,Good for beginners,"The book is very good for beginner, it gives an overview of PR and shows the student how to apply it in real life by explaining cases and developing creative thinking. I think that for a more profound view other books should be consulted. I liked it as a first dip in my immersion to PR."
2,Expensive and Confusing,"The layout and language of this extremely expensive textbook, written by one of the most seasoned and successful PR practitioners, unfortunately makes this book almost unreadable. Not only is it completely boring, but the language makes the topics seem very vague and disconnected from practical PR practice.Chapters in this book are much too long. One can infer from the title of the book that it will cover PR practice in great detail, however, the most important topic the book covers ""the execution of public relations"" only gets 112 pages of a nearly 600 page book."
1,The writer's creditability has to be questioned.,"I don't know how Seitel does in the field, but he certainly failed miserably as an textbook author. The information in this textbook is highly unorganized. There are times you will find stories and examples without proper introduction and writer's analysis/conclusions. If you look at the reference section of the book, you found most of the sources were from NY times or some local newspaper. This book is definitely everything but academic. I don't think any wise professors would feed their students with junk like this.Check this out:""The problem is that e-crooks are not only difficult to stop, but also difficult to define, at least in legal terms""(P136). Does this sentence even make sense logically???As much as I appreciate Mr.Seitel's enthusiasm to be an amateur writer, I don't think majority of the readers enjoyed getting their intelligence insulted at the same time."
5,One of the finest PR texts available,"I've recently attended Mr. Seitel's PR workshop. A truly excellent and insightful lecture about the truths of PR: how to obtain professional, real results without the BS.Follow his advice and you will truly be successful in either a corporate or agency environment"
2,12 in farberware,"The first 3 weeks using this pan was great, nothing stuck to it. I even was able to brown meat in it and the pan made a decent fond. Then i noticed a nick in the nonstick surface. I have never used anything besides wood and rubber utensils in the pan, so i know it was not me. I am going to see if i can return it; must be a manufacturers defect."
2,it's a STICK pan,"I agree with a review by ""Keith Bell"" and a few others. I bought the pan two years ago, and don't have to wait that long before the pan started to lost its non-stick quality. I can't even cook an egg in it anymore. It stuck to the pan and looks like the surface of the moon. Even fish (with skin) stuck to the pan as well."
1,A Hasbeen,"I recently purchased a 10"" and 12"" Farberware Millennium pans. Right out of the box either of these pans nonstick surface worked. I followed all the instructions and kept the heat on low and didn't use any cooking spray. I had to scrape my eggs out of the pan.To make matters worse,there's no 800 numbers to Farberware so you could speak to someone. The only way you can contact them is to set up an account with them. Farberware was a name you could trust in cookware. In my opinion their a hasbeen. Your better off spending your cash at Walmart. Their pans cheaper, and perform a lot longer."
2,Non-stick coating doesn't stay non-stick,"Like others, I bought this pan based on early good reviews. The pan is big and heavy and heats very evenly. The rubber insert on the handle is nice, making it possible to pick up the hot pan without a pot holder.The critical problem is in the failure of the non-stick coating to keep its properties. When I first bought the pan, it worked beautifully. However, after just six months, the coating was not performing as well as before. After a year, the pan is just like any other skillet, requiring a good coating of oil to prevent foods from sticking. The pan received only the recommended handling. No spray-on oils were used. The pan was always washed by hand, with only a sponge. Needless to say I'm disappointed that my ""non-stick"" pan is nothing but a dark-colored skillet.I'd look for another brand based on this experience."
1,Non stick surface is short lived,"I bought one of these from Amazon a couple of years ago. It worked well for about 9 months. We pampered this pan. We always used plastic utensils, we never subjected the pan to high heat, we always washed it by hand. The surface still looks nice, everything sticks to it. I wrote to Faberware and they never wrote back. Last night I ruined my last omelet."
1,Will Never Buy Farberware Again!!!,"Farberware claims that they guarantee these pots and pans forever. Well after a short amount of time, the frying pan developed a bulge on the underside of the pan preventing it from sitting flat on the cooking surface. No problem I thought since it was guaranteed..Well after sending it back to Farberware, they returned it stating that it was probably exposed to temperatures that were too high! I didn't realize that their pans weren't designed to withstand a stovetop!Their promise of lifetime guarantee is bogus, their product quality is questionable and their customer service is horrible! Please don't be fooled by this brand! Avoid at all costs..!!"
1,I got the lemons,"I must have gotten the lemons,I purchaased 2 12"" and an 8, within 2 months the finish on the rims were off and the pan itself is loosing it's finish sides are turning brown and non stick is decreasing, I don't put mine in the dishwasher and I don't use pan spray..I'll be going backto Wal Mart at least those lasted a year..Lynda"
1,Disappointed,"After cooking eggs this morning and having a layer of egg stuck to the whole pan, I'm sad to say that my non-stick pan sticks. We've had this pan for maybe 8 months and I just assumed that pans lasted for several years. We even bought this pan plus the 8"" for my mother-in-law for Christmas. What a disappointment. Better begin research on a new pan...and I'll make sure to read the reviews."
2,No Stick Customer Service,"I am writing this to corroborate what the other reviewers are saying about this pan's non-stick surface dulling after a couple of months of use. I too bought this after Cooks Illustrated's rave reviews. When it started to go bad - I wanted to contact the company...but there is no phone #, no e-mail, no way to contact them... I did get in touch with someone and they said that the non-stick surface would fail if the pan was put under high heat, and that the instructions say this. I saved the packaging and it did say this.However - what constitutes ""high"" heat?? on my simmer burner high heat is a lot less than ""high"" heat on my large power burner.... basically they found a loop hole to weasel out of."
2,I'd only buy it for the pictureres,"This is an update of an old book. This means that the book spends time explaining how to detail old Tamiya tiger kits using techniques that are no longer necessary with the newer models available. The back of the book is then used to advertise Verlinden update sets.As usual with Verlinden books, the pictures are great but the modelling tips are not much help."
3,In need of an editor,"Interesting material but the lack of editing is grating. There are many instances of odd quotation marks, repeated paragraphs and bizarre punctuation. Granted it's a cheaper alternative than the paper version but I believe Kindle books still deserve the same quality control as any other book format. Shame."
3,From Back Cover,"Sarah Buchanan can't help but remember the wild times she once had with bull rider Houston Jericho. They shared a first together - watching a porn flick - and then set out to reenact the seven different erotic scenes in the film called The Fantasy Factor. But they'd only enjoyed the first three carnal fantasies before Houston left town. Since then, Sarah has left her wild ways behind her. But she's always regretted not finishing what she and Houston started....Twelve years later, Houston is back - every bit the bad boy he was all those years ago. And he aims to convince the bad girl in Sarah to come out and play once again.How can Sarah pass up the chance for more sexual adventures with Houston? After all, they both want to relive the fantasy. The Fantasy Factor. And it's going to be fantastic...."
5,Great price and very sexy,"I bought this for my wife and we're quite happy with it. It doesn't mention it in the product description, but this stocking is crotchless. My wife is 5'2"" and 130 lbs and this fits her great. It snugly wraps around all the right places. Considering the great price and free shipping, we can't complain about it at all."
4,Awsome,"My husband and I have been looking for one of these for a log time, and when I finally got it in the mail, my husband loves it. The only thing is that it takes a few minutes to get it to fit right. But once it does, like I said it's great."
1,Too small for x-large,"Wal-mart sells a bigger box than this... sorry, not the best for BIG cats unless the top is off, but that defeats the purpose....otherwise it is fine!"
4,Cats like this one!,"My two cats, including my finicky one, really like this litter box. It's nice and big and I like the scooper holder on the side. They didn't like the flap at first so I left it off until they were used to the box, then put it on and there haven't been any problems.Good product, will purchase again!"
2,"Meh, Im not happy with the clasps.","My cats like it, I think its because they don't have to clean the thing. I however am not impressed. My biggest problem with the box is the clasps. Once a liner is in place it was almost impossible to get it to clasp. The filter mine came with does not fit snug in the compartment and the door on top holding the filter does not stay closed.I do love the door. My cats always knock off the solid plastic ones but since this one is flexible they are able to to get in and out of the box and the door stays in place.In summation clasps bad, door good. Would not recommend this product, maybe Scott or Eddie would."
4,Takes time!,"As someone new to the reformed faith, this is my first book by Dr. Sproul. Wow! I am taking my time reading it because of the wealth of history and theology contained therein. As a working mom of two young children, finding quiet, uninterrupted time to digest this book has been a challenge!I'm about half-way through and have learned so much. I also watched the dvd ""Amazing Grace"" as a partner to the book and found it to be very easy to understand and a huge help in reading this book."
2,Get some of Dr. Ruckman's material on Calvinism.,"The flesh is depraved according to Romans 3, no doubt. The spirit is dead according to Ephesians 2:1-4, no doubt about it. The Bible describes man as a tri-partite being, however, and there is absolutely no reference anywhere to the depravity of the will, which is a function of the soul. In fact, Romans 7 proves the potential for righteousness of the human will, because it is what one WOULD do that is good, but the FLESH that gets in the way, NOT the individual's will! If man's will is depraved, then God spoke in vain about free-will offerings in the Old Testament passages of Ezra and Exodus 35:5, and the concept of choice (Deuteronomy 30:19, for example) is meaningless. ""To as many as received him gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that BELIEVE ON HIS NAME."" (John 1:12)...election is conditioned on believing on Christ, pure and simple..."
4,Ammunition against your local Arminian,"Sproul in his usual philosophical approach, compares and contrasts the various Arminian, Pelagian, Semi-Pelagian, and Calvinist views on soteriology and sanctification. A very concise and easy to understand presentation, though obviously he is rooting for the Calvinist side from the get-go. Still, it provides the reader with a solid historical basis for evaluating the ongoing arguments concerning the role of man's free will in a sovereign God's universe."
5,A timely book for modern evangeliscals,"As the pastor of a large church, I was deeply greatful for R.C.'s book ""Willing to Believe"". Ever since reading Luther's ""Bondage of the Will"" severeal years ago, I'd felt for some time that a modern equivalent was badly needed. In many ways Sproul's book fits the bill. It offers a great historical and theological overview on the issue of the human will. I used much of it in a recent lecture to a large group and had a good reception. Thanks R.C!"
2,"Save, and buy the 20th Century Masters collection","There is nothing wrong with the music on this disc and it is a great ""show"", and, if you are ""in the clover"", you can certainly afford it, but everything you need to hear from this unique ensemble can be acquired more reasonably by simply purchasing the 20th Century Masters collection for a fraction of the cost. The sound of 20th Century Masters collection is up to current standards, and all the hits are there (I have bought both on Amazon). Plus, you get a very fine live version of ""Get Ready"" on 20th Century Masters (this was their 20-minute anthem, and biggest hit). The problem is that this item under review was manufactured in the pre-remastering era, and Motown never got it remastered or reissued (which is why it is rare, and therefore very expensive). The bottom line is that the sound quality on 'Rare Earth in Concert' is primitive to my ears (albeit with a fine live show performance). Only 'complete-ists' need purchase 'In Concert'."
5,at last,Came across the 2LP in the 70ies. Vinyl with poor treble and quality poor as expected even with Ortofon pick up.The CD release gave of coarse better quality especially on cymbals and presicely definition of John Pershs eminent work on the bass -guitar. Sorry they did not use an 80 minute master on the CD (They pressed it to 74m 04sec)
5,A fine CD!,"This live version with long tracks has great sound and good ""power"" to it. Fun to listen to for me!"
4,Rare Earth couldn't be better,"I like the cd a lot. Rare Earth is one of my favorite bands and this cd is good. It arrived in great shape, although the case was cracked, the cd itself was in good condition."
5,Celebrate!,"There is nothing quite like hearing a band in their prime, and Rare Earth was firing on all cylinders here. Since not many R&B/Funk bands made recordings of their live concerts in the 70's, this is a good way to revisit those days. There are only a few live albums i.e., EWF(Gratitude)and AWB(Person to Person) from that period, but most of those dynamite performances from all those great 70's bands (like Mandrill) were never recorded! These songs are too good to never be heard live again. If you don't have this in your collection, get it soon ( I ripped my vinyl to CD-R). This is a must have."
5,The True Python,"The title of this highly amusing book is both informative and misleading. Informative firstly because the ""liar"" part refers to Chapman tendency to drift of into fantasy land and relate stories from Biggles books and other bizarre episodes as if they were part of his life. Misleading secondly because usually autobiographies are written by the subject - whereas for this one much of the writing was done by three others with the occasional footnote by the author (if that makes any sense). But that aside this is a highly enjoyable read as well as being painfully poignant and also thought-provoking. There is little doubt that Chapman was one of the great comic geniuses of our time, and this is a book that well represents his playful insanity."
1,Piece of junk,"New out of the box the pump would not work. After much fiddling, I managed to make the pump work SOMETIMES. The pump assembly couldn't have cost more than 5 or 10 cents to make- it is that cheesy. Customer service was uncooperative and basically said that it is normal that the pump doesn't work. Instructions for setup were vague.Gryphon Twister Stained Glass Grinder"
1,Unreliable,"We just bought this for my wife's stained glass hobby. The set up instructions are sketchy. There is no pictures or drawing to show what goes where in the assembly. But weset it up according to the instructions. After using it for about an hour, the water flow stopped. No amount of blowing or sucking as they recommend in their instruction worked. So now we have to keep the sponge wet by pouring water. They are supposed to have a 5 year warranty. I have to call the distributor (Anything in Stained Glass out of NJ) and see if I can return it. They said a lot about the special method of manufacturing their grinder bit. But we found it to wear out quite easily. Especially at the think section where the grinding is done leaving the rest of the area with lots of useless diamond that can not be used. You can turn the bit over but then again the area that actually grinds wears off very quickly."
1,"Horrible nightmare, Leaks and more leaks!!!",This pool leaks right out of the box from the bottom and the sides. This is the worst thing I ever bought and it went back to store. Intex should be ashamed to produce such junk.Do not buy unless you enjoy patching a brand new pool and having junk for all this money spent. Not fun to work so hard and then see water running from underneath the pool and the sides of the pool and never got to the point of hooking up the pump due to it leaking so bad and Intex does not have good customer service. Pro series by polygroup was the same way and thats why we tried Intex but this is bad too so were getting a doughboy so we have something for the money spent.Do Not buy as its a nightmare.
2,Liner leaks,Intex liner work great for the first season me and the kids had a easy time setting up the pool. After the first winter storage has mutism leaks and tear In liner even after proper storage and upkeep liners keeps springing new holes. This product is not worth the price with only one season of use before it began falling apart would not recommend to buy unless you live in a warm climate year round
2,Not durable,"i probably dropped this about 2 times once on the grass and once on the concrete outside. the first thing that will break is the TRIGGER!!!!! AHHHHH!!!! the trigger is the most vunerable object in the gun even with the trigger guard. the first time i dropped it, didn't break the only thing that happened was the white paint came off of the sights. when dropping it on the concrete once the trigger will break causing it to not go back to its original spot after firing."
1,Wrong gun,"I ordered for HFC M92 Vertec a full metal thru pyramid air, but instead they sent a TSD M190 that is plastic."
2,usually lame,"This gun is not good. It guzzles gas, doesn't get great power, and the mags I got leak.I bought this gun twice, the first one was ok, but the second is crap.you are taking a risk buying this gun, I would suggest just getting a good springer, because you only usually need one shot, and they will most always work.Besides the gun looks awesome, there is nothing else good about it"
4,Great Gun,"I just got this gun and it is amazing. It is one of the most realistic guns i have evr bought. The things i like about this gun are...Pros:Fps 300 (More Like 320)full metalGas Blowback, making it realy realistic.26 round clipCons: Is not full autoa little hard to load without a speed loaderOverall it is a great gun. If anyone knows how to make it shoot full auto please email me and Luke.[...]"
3,Could be better,"I bought this gun for my son. My son was happy when he received this product but when he tried it, the safety is stuck and will not work. I emailed the seller to let them know but I was told that eventhough this was shipped broken, their policy is that I have to pay for the return shipment. Shipping cost is almost 25% of the price of the gun. I immediately send them the gun so it can be replaced. They replaced the gun but when the gun arrived, it is all greasy and oily. The good news is now the safety of the replacement gun is working. This is also a semi automatic gun in case you are expecting a fully automatic gun."
4,Can't do without it....,"I bought this set about a year ago and I've cooked in it every day since then. Very sturdy and attractive, its a steal for the price. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because of minor irritants like - in my set, the lid of the dutch oven doesn't really fit the 10"" skillet perfectly. And its not scratch resistant - don't ever let metal touch the inside - even accidently. And of course - the lids can get really burning hot. But for all this, the set is really versatile - I've cooked all kinds of cuisine in it and its worked great!"
4,"Great Item, Great Value","This unit was easy to configure and setup. software for ""computer shutdown"" was easy to install, but had 1 drawback. It requires that you logon as ADMINSTRATOR. Having adminstrator rights is not enough. This is a drawback as many people don't know or remember the administrator account, nor how to change that password.Size of unit, support for up to 8 devices, battery life are very good. Allows for minimum of 2 power bricks and didn't take up much space.You'll need some cable management ties or tiewraps or something to keep your wires straight and now would be a good time to label each power cord.As stated, good unit, and good value. Don't forget if you allow your computer to run a battery to calculate how long it takes to shutdown your computer properly. If it takes 4 minutes to shut your computer down, don't allow it to run on battery for 20 minutes or there won't be enough power left for shutdown. Experiment..."
2,Too Noisy for home use,"Now that I own one of these units I cannot reccomend them. While they operate fine the make a loud noise (like a field of crickets) all the time, whether on or off. This is very obnoxious. I have since read sever threads which indicate this is a common problem for this specific APC unit. I recommend you look elsewhere. I plan to return mine Monday!"
5,Solid Power Back-Up for All,"This was my third APC battery backup. After buying two APC 350s and being very happy with them, I decided to buy an upgraded model. I was very shocked reading some of the reviews. I have none had any ""noise"" issues with any of mine. All of my are and have been silent. For safety reasons, you must connect the battery. I found this very simple and will only take a minute. You then must allow the batteries to charge. The unit can be used during this time. The software is simple, yet provides a great status readout and several options. I use the 725 as well as 350 for my computer systsem. I use my 725 for my most important equipment and get around 10-15 minutes depending on what I have pluged in. The APC support is very good. One of the best business like support for the home I've seen in the computer business. APC as a company feels very professional and secure. I have not a single bad thing to say about the 725 or its similar models and recommend one to all."
1,Much better toys on the market-Don't waste your $$$,"We received this as a present for our 6month old son.The concept is great: 6 songs---one on each side of the soft/sturdy block. However the functioning is difficult for this age (says it's for 6months & up) & even on the quiet setting the music is quite loud!One reason we really don't care for it is the fact that the song that plays is whatever side of the block is facing up (ie--you can't pick a song) so if your little on wants to sit & play he'll be listening to a differnt song than he can read the words for or play with.The toys (each song ""does"" something like pop goes the weasel has a weasel 'pop' out) aren't well made & they don't do enough to capture & hold baby's attention.There are MUCH better toys (honestly he has a blast with his musical stacking toy which costs almost nothing & simple fisher price toys) to purchase."
3,Good for Standing,I gave this to my 10 month old daughter for Christmas and she stands up at it but thats about it. My older children ages 4 and 7 seem to enjoy it more by singing the nursery rhymes. Its a cute idea but for babies there are alot better toys out there. FYI She loves the fisher price incrediblock.
4,if at first it does not succeed...,"okay here is my experience with this cd. i picked it up figuring it would be much like the planet-mu releases i was already familiar with -- namely venetian snares and mu-ziq. upon the initial spin of the disc, i was a bit turned off by the sound. it has some elements of the electronica i was looking for. upon further late night listens, the album opened up a bit for me. it is a mix of beats, textures, and voices that is playful at times and a little bit on the downer side of things as well (this is by no means a complaint). if you want an odd spin on your usual experimental electronica, one that blends organic tones with your computer beeps, give this a go. the mythology behind the album is alluring... apparently the composer suffered from agoraphobia and did not leave his house for a while. that is probably the hidden source of my interest in this album... enough!"
2,Didn't tell enough,I am 10 years old and I read this book in one day. I don't think it told the whole story of this Saint. Many interesting things were left out. If you really want to learn about Padre Pio I would suggest a different book.It is an interesting book that IS exciting to read but it leaves out really important things. The one new thing that I did learn was that there was only one year of his life that he wasn't sick. There were a number of times in this book where Padre Pio almost died.The way Padre Pio prayed all the time when he was a kid inspires me. He is definetely a Saint to read about!
1,Ask Pachi Paradicve !!!!!!!!,"Sent two (2) emails to Pachi.......They do not reply !!!!!Just wanted to know if the eagle's head is looking to the left like on the picture.Also wanted to know if the blade is stainless.Simple questions, but they don't care about their customers."
4,Great starting set,"Been using this set for 8 months, I like them alot. They all have a nice thick aluminum bottom for even heating, easy to clean. A great starting set for someone learning how to cook (like me).My only complain are the Skillet and Saucepan handles, they Curve upward. Most skillets I have used in the past, have a fairly straight handle comming off of pan, but the Classics have a raised/curved handle, and makes the balance alittle off.It feels alittle awkward, I have to tilt my wrist downward to hold it. If I hold them like other skillets, the pan will tilt back, toward me.If the handles were more straight, these would get a 5 out of 5 stars."
3,Handles get hot,"Great set, the only problem I found is that the handles on the dutch oven get too hot to handle!Cooks beautifully."
5,Criminal justice 2nd edition,"It was a good book, very cheap came in a good quality, useful, came fast thank you, easy to read and understand, outstanding over all, I recommend this book to everyone."
2,Messy and discolors,"This product is messy, smelly and discolors anything it touches. I should have bought the natural cow ears. If you feed this to your dogs, make sure its outside."
5,Cute Acorn--for some nuts!,I only hope it doesn't rust. I have friends that have squirrel pets and feel this should be great fun at their parties.
4,Old school is cool,"Had the album when I was much younger. Gave it away. Was sorry. ""Oh No"" is one of my favorites on this album as well as ""Saturday Night."" Great last album (featuring Lionel Richie) from a great group."
4,what would Joey do?,What would Joey Do? is the funniest book I have ever read. Joey named his neighbors lawn gnomes. There was nothing I didnt like about the book. I would recommend what would Joey do? to anyone who finds humor in books.
5,Absolutely No Complaints !,"My child loves Jack Gantos books. We ordered several books on this day from different stores within in the Amazon website. all books were shipped together and arrived on expected delivery date. Loved the price I paid for all the new and used books we purchased.All the books (new and used ) were in great condition only one had a child's name written inside the cover. What would Joey do, was suppose to be a used book...It came as a hard back and brand spanking new ! Absolutely No complaints here :)"
3,my review [sam],"I thought the book What Would Joey Do? was a fantastic book.It had so much description I thought I was standing there in the book. My favorite character was Joey; he was the biggest charicter.he knew exactly what to say. my favorite part of this book is when something happened to Joey's dog Pablo, when that something happened Joey was talking about how him and Pablo got along.I would definitely recommend this book to other people. so think about it and get it for yourself. You would also give this book three stars out of five."
2,What Would Joey Do?,"Joey Pigza is a 12 year old boy who has an odd hobby of labeling anything he can get his little hands on. The reason I only gave this book 2 stars was because it was slow moving. It felt like the book was never going to get over. Even though it was in a book the family kind'a weirded me out. Even though the book was kind of long, there were always things happening in it. However, you can make your own opinion and try the book out for yourself, but if you ask me I truly would not recommend it!!!!"
1,Horrible book for children under 14 years old,"Joey Pigza, although triumphant in the end, is the saddest book and story line I have ever read. I read the book with my fourth grader and we absolutely wept together through the last four chapters of the book. Between the neglect and violence of his parents and his well intentioned but sometimes emotionally abusive grandmother, Joey's world is going to leave us depressed for a long time to come. I'm happy for Joey that his character grows so much and comes out a better person for all of the trials he endures, but this book does not need to be in an elementary school library nor does it need to be read by tender hearted souls who hurt for the real Joeys in our society.My fourth grader wants to add that she cried until she felt like she was going to vomit. Not only because Grandma died but because Joey is left completely alone in the world and because of the neglect he endured by his idiotic, selfish and totally immature parents."
2,Use Caution,"This book is intriguing and captivating BUT for kids that are not hyperactive, it is disorienting. My daughter is reading it for the second time. When we discussed it after she had already started, she said that she thought that two of the main characters acted strange and bad. She also mentioned that she thought that pretty highly of the medicated ""patches"" the child in the story uses and that she would like some.This isn't good. I am very uncomfortable with books that make medication the answer to problems. For a kid on medication, this might be reassuring and positive. For a non-hyperactive kid, I think the message is very troubling.I wish I had been more on top of what this book was about, BEFORE she had started reading it."
2,Whats with the language?,"My daughter is enjoying the book, but came to me the other night and asked about what a word on pg. 43 meant. Even if Grandma is a crusty old person who curses, should we expose this type of language to our children over 10? I was appalled to see this language used in this book. Any other concerned parents out there?"
4,What Would Joey Do By: Jack Gantos,I like it when Joey dad try's to get Joeys mom (Fran) back. Then she thorough things at him to get him to leave. It doesn't work so he keeps trying. Witch makes him very brave. Joey likes this girl so he takes her to a concert. Witch is against her religion but she lets her go. At the end he kisses her. Also Joey's dad (carter) gets in a wreck out side their house because Fran was chasing him. Then his grandma dies so he dresses her up so she looks nice when she goes to haven. So at the end he goes back to school the one he wanted to go to.
4,What Would Joey Do,"What Would Joey Do is a good book. I thought it was a good book to read once, but I wouldnt want to read it again. It was funny in some parts like when Joeys dad is talking about how a relationship is like a see-saw, you get tired of it and you get off so the other person goes flying to the ground and gets hert. There were other parts that was just boring and not very fun. Joey is going to a school where the school is at home and the teacher is obsessed with Jesus. She thinks Joey is the devil. Her daghter is really mean to Joey. Soon they embark on a funny adventure. Want more then check it out."
5,awsum,this gun is the coolest thing that you can buy if you dont want to spend a lot for a gun. it can shoot about 100 feet.
5,actually a pretty good gun!,"We bought this gun for a party where the kids wanted paintball target practice, and we didn't want to worry about things like air tanks, etc. This little gun had a surprising kick to it, and was perfect for target shooting at a range between 25 and 50 feet. The kids loved it. You will need extra ammo...you'll go through it quickly."
3,Cute...,"I thought this book was a mildly amusing quick read, but there were a few things that kept me from really loving it. Maybe I'm being a little bit critical, but I thought it was annoying that the writer kept reminding us that the heroine (Angel) was supposedly ""strong"" and/or ""tough"" because she had a difficult childhood, yet every time she was around the hero (Cooper) she was falling over backward (literally) only to be rescued by him. I can understand it happening once, twice at a stretch, but I believe it happened more like five or six times. I understand that we're supposed to see it as a metaphor for the imbalance he was creating in her life, yada yada, but come on! We get it already! And for a writer on an assignment, Angel sure had an awful lot of time to spend playing cat-and-mouse with Cooper. When did she ever work?! I know, I know...it's only a story. But it's attention to details like that that make the difference between a good book and a great one."
3,Journalist meets ex-lawyer,"Angel Buchanan is an investigative reporter and takes the opportunity to investigate her father's death. Of course no-one knows that he's her father and she wants to get revenge on his squeaky clean image as ""Artist of the Heart"". When she gets embroiled in the family and meets C J Jones, an ex-lawyer who had some heart attacks and decided to change his life.She finds that her preconceptions of her father and his second family are shaky and that she has to ask herself what she wants for the future.It's not a bad read, but I felt that sometimes Angel wasn't very believable as a journalist. The relationship between her and CJ was quite believable and touching. Some of the other relationships were quite believable as well. The story was just not all that strong."
1,igourmet.com needs to update with amazon,"I purchased a smaller version of this gift basket just in time for a family member's birthday and was notified two days after the purchase that the order was canceled. Apparently, and I checked this later on igourmet.com, the gift basket was out of stock. So, I decided to purchase this basket. But, just in case, I checked igourmet.com first. Well, after checking I saw that this basket is sold out too, but it's not noted here. My relative's gift will be late now. So, beware of ordering gifts from igourmet.com here. The item may be sold out at igourmet and it might not be noted here at Amazon. So, check igourmet's inventory first at their website, or just order from someone else."
4,This is a great recording for children!,I had the cassette and my player ate it up! I am so happy to find it here. Nice collection of Hebrew and English songs with some dance songs too. Judy Caplan Ginsburgh has a wonderful voice.
3,"Liked the songs, but the format is questionable...","I don't know about you, but when I'm trying to entertain my kids, especially on long car trips, I like to stick a CD (or tape) in and have it go for 90 minutes (or however long of straight music).With this album (which we originally heard on tape), I had to keep rewinding the side with ""Day"" songs because the ""Night"" songs were too mellow to keep the kids interested.That WAS on a long car trip, and I think that even on CD, the format doesn't provide enough consistent entertainment to keep the kids from groaning every time you hit the ""boring"" songs.It's an interesting concept, and maybe it works well for younger kids or short playtimes at home. Certainly, I have nothing against Caplan Ginsburgh's music -- which is consistently enjoyable and fun. But I mention this limitation because listening to music is one of our favourite car-time activities, and this album was just plain frustrating for that...!"
4,"Good Bossk, but the new one is more articulated","This is a decent Bossk, and much better than the earlier one. However, the newer one is a lot better, with many points of articulation. This guy's stance is a bit awkward. I'd really only recommend this one if you strongly don't like articulated figures (or the inevitable seams that show up)."
4,Bossk is BACK!,"This figure is cool,fun and durable.It's hard to make him hold the gun,but he doesn't need it to be cool.Watch for IG-88 this fall!"
5,Hauntingly Beautiful Anime for Grownups,"I find myself wondering whether the Amazon editorial reviewer watched the same series I saw as a fansub.Haibane Renmei is beautifully drawn, enigmatic and steeped in otherworldly mystery. No fights. No fanservice. No slapstick humor - although it has moments that make you laugh. Just an introspective, achingly beautiful story.Probably not appropriate for young kids, although not for the idiotic reasons cited above, but instead because the series examines issues that would be troubling for most pre-teens (betrayal, redemption, suicide, death). I can only assume that all this passed right over the head of the reviewer.I've preordered the disk, and anxiously await the rest of the series coming out."
5,A Perfect Start,"This first DVD of the series defies description... No, really, I'm not quite sure what its draw is.It just seems that the first DVD seems to simply click. The music, the characters, the animation all of it seems to blend seemlessly or near enough so as to not matter. The music is etheral and splendely blends with the series itself.Brought to you by the creators of Lain and Niea under Seven, Haibane Renmei is exactly the quality you would expect from these names. Now I may not be the greatest of Otaku, but I have seen more than my fair share of anime and this one is one the most impressive ones I have seen in a long time...I am eagerly looking forward to the next DVD..."
3,Barbie Doll,1997 Cool Blue Barbie DollI had her when I was a GirlAnd I lost her then I saw her Now I will have her backand I can't Wait I love her she is Beautiful
5,The best,This is such a great Bible. From the moment you begin reading you get such clarity in the scriptures. I download this Great Book on my cellphone as well!
4,A GREAT SOURCE,I barrowed my dads life application study bible king james version and was tempted to tape the binding back together from where he had used it so much it was falling apart. Great tool! Alot of info in one book. Keeps the library clean and compact. I give this work a honest 4 star rating. Not anything really exactly wrong with it just not my top choice for commentary. Nevertheless a great tool to have on hand!
5,Very easy to use,"I am still learning to navigate this e-edition, but so far have found it very enjoyable to use. Wish I had it a long time ago. I highly recommend this edition to anyone, young or older."
1,This Bible supports Arminianism,I downloaded the sample of this Bible to my Kindle Fire and am I glad that I didn't purchase it. The sample came with the entire gospel of John. As I read through the notes I came to this: Jesus made the first choice to come and save us and now we have the choice whether or not to choose Him! This makes our Lord out to be a beggar in need of us. The entire gospel of John is very clear that our God chooses us. Jesus even stated that no man can come to Him unless the Father draws that man. If you believe God's word from the biblical reformed view then stay far away from this.
4,Love it but needs some things fixed.,"I love using the print version of this bible so I have been looking and finally found it for the kindle app on my iPad. This electronic copy is great until you get to the Master Index. The abbreviations of books and personality profiles, among others, are jumbled. The book names are printed over top the abbreviation. In the personality profile, it looks good at the beginning, once you click on the persons name to see the profile, it happens again. Things are jumbled. I hope that it gets fixed in an update soon."
1,Not What I Thought,The Kindle version of the Life Application Bible is totally different from the hard copy and had to return it.Life Application Study Bible KJV
2,No red lettering,The biggest problem I have is that there is no red lettering 4 Christ words. Please fix. This would B very helpful.
5,THE BEST SERIES ABOUT VAMPIRES EVER WRITTEN,I have read the whole series as a book is published I get it and read it. I am not a big reader but he gets me hooked and I can not put it down. I hope he keeps the series going for a long time I enjoy his writting alot. He is so good at discribing the characters that I can imagine them very easily.
3,It Is Not!,"If you are planning to buy this cd please don't! Buy the ""Gold"" cd better. Now the sound of this cd is very good. That's not my issue here the problem is the Slow n Easy version that was included here. So what if it is from the European version of ""Slide it In"" this version is totally lame. The version from the American ""Slide it In"" featuring John Sykes, and Neal Murray is much much better! It rocks harder with killer guitar riffs. The American version of Slow n Easy was the first Whitesnake song I ever heard and it blew me away. I was completly p!@#off when I bought this and found out that they had the lame Euro version. The ""Gold"" cd has the killer version that we all know."
4,The Kid don't know Whitesnake from blacksnake...,"While the most recent ""Here I Go Again"" 2CD collection wasn't bad considering you could get all 3 of the popular U.S. Geffen releases on 2 CDs including bonus tracks remastered, this release contains 5 tracks of the older material in remastered form, therefore giving the listener more of a perspective of the band's history. What is really surprising is that the CD contains the original European versions of ""Love Ain't No Stranger"" and ""Slow An' Easy"" which was never released in the U.S. or on the Geffen label. The track ""Slide It In"" however, remains as the U.S. remix on this set which was a bit disappointing. It was also nice to hear a remastered version of ""Pride And Joy"". In essence, this is a good collection for the casual listener who likes the well known hits but wants a little more more retrospective of the band's history. But in reality there are better European ""Best Of's"" out there if you look hard enough..."
4,Very comprehensive of the career of Coverdale,"Great to have a little of him with Page and liner notes are great to read of history of Whitesnake, Purple and the band members...enjoyed and brought back some great music memories."
4,Better than expected,Lots of remastered tracks and several good timejams are on this cd. Many good hard rocking songs I had never heard before. A coupa cheezy songs makes this one a 4.
4,"Solid Collection, But Not ""Definitive""","A very solid collection of Whitesnake songs primarily from ""Slide it In"" ""1987"" and ""Slip of the Tongue"". These songs are all most people will need, but if you are a hardcore 'Snakes fan, you are better off buying ""Gold: Whitesnake"" as it has far more from the band's early years.I should point out that one of the big upsides to this album is that it features the U.K. versions of all the songs off ""Slide it In"". These versions are quite difficult to obtain in the U.S., and many feel are superior to the more slickly produced American cuts. These are, however, certainly not ""remixed"" versions as the ""Kid Reviewer"" claimed in his three unnecessary and uninformed reviews.In conclusion this is a very good collection of Whitesnake songs, but not quite as ""Definitive"" as it claims to be."
3,surely not!,"Come on guys, get real! The only true definitive collection is a remastering of the entire back-catalogue. Saints and Sinners had all the good songs on it, as did Come An Get It, the latter probably the single best Whitesnake album of their early period.With such a long history and varied members, one disc, or even two, is only going to diminish the greater achievements of the full-length albums. This is one rock band that deserves more than just another compilation that will surely just end up in the cheap bins."
5,definately !!,Great to have in your collection has all the best hits.Can't go wrong withthat!!wish there was some new stuff.
4,"The Dave songs get 5 stars - everything else gets 3, so 4's the average","The cover of Jump is worth the cost of the entire CD, plus shipping. I have no idea who John Jorgenson is, but he and his band clearly understand Van Halen's music. Further covers of this song by others will, like post-Godfather gangster movies, result only in inevitably unfavorable comparisons.Ed, Al, Mike, and Dave: C'mon guys. One last tour, and we can all get on with everything else."
1,As weird as David Lee Roth looks now,"All it took was one listen to a bluegrass version of ""Jump"" to make my evening meal make a stronger comeback than David Lee Roth. Don't even bother with this entire album. It's a disgrace to bluegrass music and rock'n roll. This sonic catastrophy is as plastic as Roth's new face and sorority girl smile. If there was a way to rate this ""zero"", I would."
1,Don't Do It...,"Don't waste your hard earned money on this travesty. Tribute albums usually don't live up to expectations and this one is no exception. The two tracks with DLR on vocals sound like a drunken karoke hillbilly version of the originals (not to diss hillbillies or drunks). The other tracks sans Roth are less annoying but still not something I'd choose to listen to again. However, having said all this, the ""dueling banjos"" version of Eruption must be listened to if only for its comedic value. But, if you're a fan of Deliverance, you may like it."
1,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING??!!!,"I've been a big fan of all things VH ever since I heard Diver Down at the age of 13. I've also been playing spoons to bluegrass for at least ten years, so when I saw this I thought it would be the bluegrass equivalent of rocked out.I was wrong. This has to be the worst CD I have ever purchased. It was actually depressing to hear the life sucked out one of the most energizing bands of all time.I will be throwing this CD in the garbage because I can't handle the chance that someone else's emotional stability may be damaged forever."
1,Ramone... Bring Me Someone With Talent!,"I bought this CD to listen to while driving in my hybrid, but it was so terrible that I flew into a fit of angry bear rage and smashed the disc. It took four pots of honey to clam me back down afterwards. Unless you are the type to walk around all day in a robe sipping on broth, I don't think you should buy this!"
4,Just saw David and co. on TV,"Buying it today - they were great on tv!(If you don't like lots of banjo, etc. - then you won't like it. It's definitely NOT what you think that David Lee Roth would ever do - but ""I"" really liked it!"
1,"C'mon Dave, gimme a break","Dave showed up to hawk this atrocity on the Tonight show. He played a version of ""jump"" that was basically random noise. It was so aweful, I had to change the channel before he finished. This is *not* a brilliant re-imagining of killer classic VH. It's an inside joke, and a very bad attempt at making music. If you even think of buying this, maybe you should slap yourself, or have a friend do it for you."
5,music lovers will enjoy this very much,"If you like Van Halen and love music in general, you will really enjoy this disc. The bluegrass artists who contributed really gave it their all, and the music shines. A few of the tracks are more like curiosities than real art, but this is quibbling. An outstanding collection."
5,Van Hillbilly?,Outstanding. These are timeless classic rock radio staples done (or re-done) expertly. This is not a typical tribute CD. This is a world class collection of bluegrass musicians that have covered a great collection of work from one of the greatest American rock bands ever! Love it!
3,"Well, it's a tribute album after all...","Well, it's a tribute album after all. We should not expect more than what a tribute album has to offer.What i really like is that Diamond Dave keeps having fun, at least that's what we all should expect from life isn't it? As long as he likes what he's doing, it's ok with me, and if the music has something interesting, new arrangements, nice interpretation, even when it's a whole different genre, í'll give it a try and listen to it sometimes."
1,Tell Dave to JUMP!,"I wish I could review this with two different reviews. The first would be a 5 star review for the very talented Bluegrass artists and the wonderful job that they have done on these tunes. The second would be a -5 star review for Dave's horrible job in this mix. Van Halen has been one of my favorite groups for almost 30 years, but this is a worthless attempt for Dave to sell something. I would prefer this tribute without him, especially his bizarre personality on tour with this CD."
3,Hits and Misses,"I love Eruption and Unchained, but do not care for the songs with Dave singing. His voice doesn't blend with bluegrass, and he overdoes it (as usual). The band is great. I love VH and bluegrass!"
1,JUST USELESS NEW AGE,"This is a nice book to show you what IS NOT Tai Chi. The REAL Tai Chi is one of the most devastating martial arts (Ask Master Erle Montaigue)This guy Chunglian is pleased to sell books about something NOT EXISTING such Tai Chi for health, meditation and peace. I really feel annoyed by this good-for-nothing Tai Chi (?). Why almost nobody explains about Dim Mak & Fa Jing?"
5,"Here at my favorite shopping spot, Amazon.com, looking for the perfect teakettle","Loving everything stainless steel this teakettle caught my eye. Hot tea and cocoa for winter, in the summer time heat up the kettle for some ice tea. Just the right size, heats water very fast and it's easy to clean."
3,Katie's Premature Brother,"This combination coloring book/ story book has been written for siblings of premature babies. Katie expresses her feelings of jealousy, sadness and concern after the birth of her premature brother, Christopher. Finally, Katie is invited to visit Christopher in the NICU and looks forward to his homecoming. Although slightly outdated this book does a nice job of addressing the feelings of siblings of premature babies. The illustrations are clear and simple for coloring by children of all ages."
3,Good Audio But Slightly Bulky,"Compared to the other brands , this one is cheaper. ... The audio is good and the bass effect is ok.However the unit is a bit bulky compared to the other brands such as Sony.So if you are looking for compact ones do not go for this."
3,Not really worth it in the end,"This book tries to cover so much ground so it is destined not to succeed in all areas. The technologies it covers are indeed all Microsoft focused/centred and the case study described serves as a vehicle for examining obstacles and how the author's team overcame them. However, the solutions given are not anything out of the ordinary and no new ground is broken - it is all common sense really or a case of back to basics. The reason I rate this with 3 stars (besides the luck of a 2.5 stars option) is because the first chapters have some basics on project management that are not described in the usual boring style found in other books/courses. The advice on e.g. how to prioritise deliverables or on planning a project is very straightforward, easy to follow and to the point. This is a very practical book but quite what audience it aims to satify remains unknown."
1,no where close...,get a real book and put in real efforts... there is no short cut to oo world... or there is no free ride in any profession that requires solid skills....
1,Not worth the effort,"This is a truely bad book. Not only is it poor in information content and style, but it is also misleading when it is not trivial. Anybody with more than three days of programming experience knows that writting: myCounter++;//increment myCounter is not usefull use of comments and in case it is out of place in a book on programming methodology--even if it is practical. The only use of this book is as PR of a group of companies, most prominently Microsoft. Even then, it's main argument is `Why bother using anything not invented by Micrisoft?' Indeed, why bother? Straight to the bin."
2,how to make bug-ridden software,"Jesse Liberty appears to be a good follower of Bill Gates. Microsoft development tools are praised all the time, and Chapter 1 & 2 teaches you how to make bug-ridden software and make money with it. But the rest of the book gives you some good tips about OO software development."
3,good bass but lacks clairity,this system is very good for what you pay for it but its sorta slow reading the cd. its got good bass but also lacts trebble and clairity...but what do you expect from a system that costs that much?...overall its a very good stereo.......for the price that is
1,What a ripoff.,"We bought this toy with high hopes. The picture on the box shows kids backlit by a crisp and clear starry sky. Unfortunately, this is far from reality with this toy. The stars are blurry on the wall, the words are illegible, and the toy needed some work to even get it's cheap little flashlight to light up. This is a sad excuse for an educational toy."
1,very poor projection quality,"I found this product sorely lacking in calling itself a star theatre planetarium. To see the stars clearly you have to be 1 foot away, while the rest of the stars on the periphery are all blurred. This is an expensive boondoggle."
5,Thoroughly researched,"I have read several books by Erlich Hagai. This book gives this rare glimpse of how the Arab world views Ethiopia. The only thing I would add to the book is Ethiopians view of the Arabs.It is a wonderful book.Grum KetemaArlington, Virginia"
5,This artist knows love.,Love songs a very special compliation of some of Reg's great hits. A must for any true Elton John fan.
3,Elton John Love Songs 1969-1995.,"Elton has been recording for 40 + years and amassed a vast collection of songs, this 1995 release brings 17 love songs.I may be living in a time capsule as I mostly enjoy his 1970s stuff, especially Someone Saved My Life Tonight, Sorry seems To Be The Hardest Word and the wonderful instrumental, Song For Guy.I am less interested in the 1980s and 1990s songs, although there is never any doubt about the quality of Elton's work.I already have another CD Love Songs, put out in the early 1980s, this is right up my street with among 16 tracks Little Jeannie, Return To Paradise and a poignant All Quiet On The Western Front.Neither has what could be his greatest love song, Tiny Dancer.Enjoy either or both albums, although some songs are duplicated."
4,GOOD COLLECTION,"Containing some of Elton John's best work,this is a pretty good collection. My mother actually owns this,but I enjoy it too. Spanning Elton John's entire career,this album has songs ranging from the classic ""Your Song"" to the Lion King's ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight."" My favorites would have to be ""Candle In the Wind"",""You Can Make History(Young Again)"",and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight."" If you are looking for a good Elton John album or just want some of his best work on one album,this will definately be a very good buy. Purchase and enjoy some of the most beautiful love songs ever written."
3,Elton's Greatest Hits (Quiet Version),"Includes some of Elton's best, some different live versions of popular songs. Some of these are recent songs. A good overview of his career but I would have picked other songs for this collection."
3,There are some songs missing....,"As always with this type of compilation you get a rehash of the same songs .... while true love songs are missing...old songs such as ""I need you to turn to "" and ""First Episode at Heinton"" more recent songs like ""Blue Avenue"" and ""Please""... but really ""Believe"" ? and a live ""Candle in the wind"" when he nearly sounded like he was going to be gone with the wind...Do yourself a favor and check out the songs ""High Flying Bird"" and ""Pinky"". Thank You, Tim Norris"
1,Not Reliable.,"This clock is a piece of junk. It has a good set of features, but the alarm doesn't always go off. Perhaps 1 in 20 times, it just makes a faint click. If the alarm can't be depended on to work without fail, it makes the whole thing kind of useless as an alarm clock."
3,not impressed,"I am not impressed by the quality considering the price, wish it didn't have Hydrated Silica, an ingrediant that I try to avoid."
4,I like this tooth paste,"A good paste to have in rotation of you use different pastes at different times of day. This makes a good morning toothpastes, not very harsh. I cannot attest to the ingredients in the paste but it does taste clean."
4,No chemicals & clean/fresh teeth,I like this product. Not only does it not have any dyes or chemicals in the toothpaste but it keeps my teeth white and fresh. It does its job.
5,A chilling look at US sponsored state terror in the Southern Cone,"In ""The Condor Years"", Jonh Dinges does a wonderful job documenting US complicity in overthrowing the democratically elected Popular Unity government in Chile and instituting Operation Condor, a network of right-wing military dictatorships in Latin America's six southernmost countries with the aim of crushing popular movements for economic democracy, social justice and political freedom. As such, it is an essential text for activists and scholars interested in human rights, civil liberties, union organizing, political repression in the Americas, corporate globalization and peace. The book also delves into the role that pro-business, reactionary Cuban exiles played in hunting down Chilean dissidents living in the US. Given current events in Colombia, Iraq and elsewhere, this is an urgent and frightening book!"
3,Very Pink Chair,This is a very pink chair. It would be better in white but then they'd have to change the name and everything.
3,"Good book, but overprized.","This book indeed covers the standar subject of topology, and is well written, self contained and elegant. For a topology class there is no much more for the teacher to do than to clearify the definitions, so the best advice is to get the book in order to be prepared for class.The only problem with this book is the prize. I don't understand why publishing companies think that we are going to pay 120 bucks for a paperback edition of a book on a subject that is not even ""state of the art - frontiers of the science"" kind."
3,RCA RP1802 Portable Cassette Player,"This is a great travel tool if you have small children. Books on tape(also available from Amazon!) are a real treat for little ones whiletraveling. At this price, you won't be too worried about the player being dropped! Nice for the car too....especially if you are as tired of hearing kids tapes as we are! :)"
3,Well .. It's Ok,"This toy plays short symphony's of music like Peter and the Wolf etc.. and lights up when music is playing. BUT the baby, well I have to press the nose of the sun to activate it. My 7 month old baby smiles and likes the toy but once the music ends the fun does.Like I said it's Ok. It's well made the fabric is soft and music is nice. FYI- Barnes and Noble was selling it for almost 60 bucks I got it on Amazon for around 20ish. Just a heads up."
4,Fun toy for babies,"This is a great toy for babies, the music is different than most toys and the sounds is good. I also like how durable it is. i would recommend this toy to babies that are under 1 1/2!!"
1,Terrible!,"This toy never worked properly from the start. Sometimes it would play just fine and other times it would not play music at all, the lights would only flash. I replaced the batteries, but the problem continued. After 2 1/2 months the toy stopped working completely. I contacted the company and was told that there was nothing that they could do to help me out, too much time had passed (I purchased the toy in mid-August 2010 and contacted the company in early November). This company has horrible costumer service, not to be able to help me out after only having the item 2 1/2 months! This toy had not been abused in anyway, my child is only an infant. When this toy worked it was only slightly entertaining for my infant. I would not recommend this toy to anyone and if you do decide to purchase it, don't purchase it through this retailer, find another retailer that provides costumer service should the toy stop working."
1,Does not do what it says,"First, it smelled like chemicals when I opened it. Second, it is bulky and not suttible for babies, it is bigger than what it looked like. Third, the musical does not play for the length it says. I would not recommend this toy."
3,Nice music but..,"This toy plays a wonderful selection of music but it states that there are 2 modes of play and we have toggled between the 2 modes only to discover that there is really only 1 mode. We have replaced the toy with a new one thinking that it was defective and it was the same situation. Overall, we like it because the music is very nice to listen to. I just wish it worked as advertised."
3,Mixed feelings,"From all the rave reviews this product received, I guess I was expecting this awesome toy. It's nice. My daughter seems to enjoy looking at it. The music is okay. What I don't like about it. You have to actually unzip the back of the product to turn it on and off, or change the mode of music playing. So, I have attached this to her bouncer and on occasion I've accidently bumped the bouncer whle holding her sleeping in my arms and there goes the music. There are two modes: The first mode has 4 short tunes that repeat once. It is activated by motion or by pressing the nose. There are only four tunes that repeat and they are short. Maybe about 20 or 30 seconds long. The other mode has one of the tunes then these other 2 or 3 sounds and the toy must be moved in order to activate it. Now my baby is only 2 months old, so maybe when she's older she'll adore as many of the others have."
3,Continuous Music Play Time Is ONE Minute,"Pros:- Many textures, colors, and shapes- Four lights that flash with the music- Interactive mode where you hit the nose and it plays music for about 10 secondsCons:- The ""lullaby"" mode is too short - the package says it will play music continuously for only ONE minute- Amazon's website says it will play music continuously for SIX minutes (which appears to be incorrect)Unfortunately we needed a toy that would play music for at least six minutes continuously - one minute is too short so we returned it. I uploaded a photo of the back of the package if that helps others that are considering this toy."
4,Christmas Present,Item description was right-on. Arrived on time. My 1 year old granddaughter has no problem with making the toy play the sounds and music.
5,Gift for Grandchild,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my youngest grandchild. He appears to love music (not noise), he can push the nose and activate the music after being shown just once."
2,be sure to order the correct model!,"I ordered these, thinking they would fit my newly-installed Pioneed CDX-687 6-CD changer. but they do not fit. They are an older model, larger, and not what i needed. So i write this as a caution. if your CD changer needs the JD-612V magazine, this set is not 3 of those (as i assumed), but three of an earlier model."
4,They work fine,"If you have a Pioneer PD M423 CD player you must use the six disk magazines. You could get by with just reloading one, but loading them and unloading them is inconvenient. So owning several magazines makes sense. We've owned our CD player for more than 10 years delete, and the original three magazines have not fail (knock on wood). I'm glad they're still being made."
5,Is this for OPTIMUS TOO?,"I would like to know that if I BOUGHT this product,the cd magazine from pioneer would it fit into the optimus Stereo that I have at home?Delilah from BX. NY"
3,Not worth it,"$13 bucks list price? Forget it. Even the low I see right now of a used copy for $1.50(plus shipping) seems a tad high.Don't get me wrong, I love the Lips. I feel Yoshimi is one of the best albums to come out in years. Fight Test is a great song, but we don't really need to get the album version on a single, with a raw squeeky voiced version. The other track is available elsewhere too.Hey if you are collector, get a used copy. The jacket art is great. Your money is better spent on the limited CD/DVD edition of Yoshim...the sound is AMAZING!""I don't know where the sunbeams end and the starlights begin, its all a mystery."""
5,Self-help in action,"Wagmore is a friendly, happy dog with a tail that loves to wag. His tail wagging upsets his family however because it's always making noises or messes or breaking things. Threatened with having to stay home from a hike because of the damage his tail wagging has caused, Wagmore curls up with some self-help books to help him conquer his habit With hard work, he gets his tail under control, but finds there are times when tail wagging can be useful after all. The book is engaging and there is some tension, but all ends well. Boys, in particular, may like this story. The book has about 600 words."
5,What a treat!,"Wow, I couldn't stop howling after I read this book! A book that I have read several times, one that can teach lessons without ""trying to teach lessons""! Good, easy reading for anyone who enjoys down home values. I am going to look into more of his books."
2,Size does matter...,Not impressed with the size. Very shallow. I would return this this if I would have purchased this at a bick and morter store. Very cheap quality for farberware. You can do better just as well as buying one from wal-mart.
5,What a great value,"I cant believe what a great value this griddle is - it wasnt expensive and it works really well. Thanks, Amazon!"
2,"An ""Okay"" pan",I did not like this pan very much. It is very light. I have used it for grilled sandwiches. The lid is too high and very inconvenient to store. I do not recommend this. I'll probably use it to make omelettes.
1,Terrible quality,"I purchased this unit and got less than one year out of it. First the AM tuner quit working, then the time set buttons, so that you can't even set the time. A real piece of junk. Stay away from the RCA brand for audio products."
4,"THis clock is simple, works fine, with great HUGE display!",I have this clock and it works great. I can see the time from 3 rooms away. The other guy who's clock broke must've got BCA brand from Chinatown.
3,Not bad,"not a bad book but since i already knew most of the information in it, it wasn't as interesting as i hoped. Yeah, FDA is joke, most doctors prescribe antibiotics without even considering your illness or your medical history, sort of like free candy. Modern medicine became a sham since there are plenty of ""alternative"" or ""natural"" cures that work as well as most of medications that are being supressed. I have also had a negative reaction to antibiotics before and because of it stopped taking it altogether. Nothing new there."
1,Sativol - worthless,The main ingredient is oatmeal. Yep. That's all that is in there. You really are paying for a fancy label on a gag gift. Has no effect beyond what a steaming bowl of stirabout with milk has on a kid. Save your money.
4,Nice Lamp!,"I like this lamp. However, I wish that it was a screw-on type that could screw onto my bed post. Other than that, it is very nice;I would recommend it to others."
5,Cool sneakers!,My daughter likes them alot. She says they're very comfortable. I like the way they look.
2,Soap bag,"I'm not completely happy with this bag. After use unless you empty the soap and rinse the bag, the next time you are ready to use it it's stiff as a board from all the melted soap that's hardened."
3,Pretty Good Soap Pouch,"i needed to replace my old soap pouch and this one seemed like a good one. I'm happy that I have a new one but it doesn't seem like it is going to last as long as my last one (3+ years). The draw string on this one does not stick. It has a wooden bead that the drawstring threads through and it doesn't hold. So, you end up with a soap pouch that is open and the soap slips out.Also, when I first got it, it seemed to have just the right amount of abraisiveness to it but now it is really soft and won't do much for exfoliation.Ultimately, it is better than just using a bar of soap and it is well put together but I think there are probably better products out there. I'll use it and be happy with it but I don't know that I'd buy it again."
2,Spelling workout,I have to use this book for spelling because that is what the teacher chose. I don't like it and find it very confusing. There are far better spelling books out there and I wouldn't waste my time on this one.
3,We need some Elmer's over here !,"I love this border and it makes our Zanzibar nursery complete, but it was difficult to hang. No matter how much or how little water we used this ""pre-pasted"" paper didn't want to stick. My mom and I have done a lot of wall papering and the glue on this border stinks (not sticks!)We ended up having to use Elmer's for the curling edges and just really hope that the border stays put now."
3,"Cute border, inadequate adhesive.","I have used the border twice (two homes) and the border looks nice. Before you take on the task of installing it, make sure you run by your local hardware store and get yourself some wall border adhesive (it is a bottle with a little roller on top). The glue on the back of the wall border is not enough to properly adhere to wall. Typically the bottom just comes off the wall and sections lift off if you dont have enough glue on there. Looks good though and worth the effort."
3,"Cute, but doesn't stick","I have had to reapply this border on numerous occasions. It just won't stick. I even tried double-sided tape and buying wallpaper glue, but nothing works. It is very cute though and goes beautifully with the set."
1,Wallpaper wouldn't stick!,"This was frustrating at best and the wallpaper was never put up. We tried a little water, lots of water, but nothing worked. Never tried using glue because we weren't sure what it would do to the walls. Luckily, this was the worst prodcut we had to deal with."
5,SO GOOD........,I have been on edge for a long time. Every little thing would set off my anger. I have taken so many different drugs for it but this one makes me feel so relaxed. And it doesn't take several weeks to kick in. Just about an hour. I have never felt better and I have told all of my friends. Please try it! You will not regret it.
1,had a bad effect on me,"I started taking this product because I read good reviews about it. I sometimes feel a little low in the winter months and thought this might lift my spirits during the gray cold months. Within 2 weeks of taking this product, I was very moody and irritable. I was snapping at people and growling around like a nut-head. I stopped taking it and in a couple days I was back to normal. This experience made me realize my little lows are not so bad!In my experience, I suggest people be very VERY careful with taking this product. Start with a very low dose and SLOWLY work your way up till you think it is helping.I won't take it again...and threw it in the trash."
2,Price increase,All I know is I have to give these to my dog and from August 1st to Sept 16 they went from 29.00 to 41.00.Guess I will find something to give him...beings I am not even sure they are helping him.
1,Horrible stomach pains,"This did nothing for me first of all. I thought it might help my severe PMS/PMDD symptoms. I only lasted 11 days due to the severe stomach pains. On day 5 I was in so much pain, curled up on the couch with nausea. Things were then okay for a few days, then got bad on day 11. It woke me up from sleeping at 6 am in severe pain. I just threw them all away and will never take this again. If I didn't know about the abdominal pain as a side effect I would be in the ER thinking I have appendicitis or something. This is awful and it hasn't gone away all day. I hope it stops soon. I'll update when I know how long it takes to go away after stopping."
1,Zero Results At Maximum Dose,"I bought the Nature Made SAME-e Complete, 400mg tablets at Walmart and after a couple of days of the recommended dose didn't notice any effect. I then increased my daily regimen to the maximum dose of 1600mg per day, or 4 pills. After taking this dosage for many weeks, I noticed absolutely no change at all. However, after I stopped taking them, I did notice I felt depressed. I do not recommend this product as I experienced none of the promised positive effects, even at maximum dose, and the pills made me feel worse after stopping usage. A nice chunk of money down the tubes just to feel bad."
2,"Works as advertised, esp. if you're BALD!","OK, this is the most reputable SAM-e brand and I've given it 2 trials a year apart.And yes, I'm pretty sure I noticed the advertised mood and joint benefits each time.But what I also noticed each time was that my hair was falling on the keyboard and my eyelashes were irritated by my shedding eyebrows!This is why I re-tried it this year - hoping it was all my imagination and that I could still reap the benefits.But nope, same thing each time. I finally googled about hairloss and SAME-e, and sure enough, other people reported the same problem.I won't argue that this is probably a rare side-effect, and that most people will benefit from taking this stuff. So, give it a try, and don't worry about your hair (at first, anyway).But, speaking just for me, any mood improvements were offset by a receding hairline...so, back to the drawing board!"
4,SAM-e is very helpful.,"I suffer with clinical depression and ADHD. I also have problems with anxiety. I was tired of being drugged up on prescription meds all the time, so I (stupidly) decided to stop taking them. After being miserable for a while, I fell upon SAM-e and decided to give it a try. I am very happy with how much it helps me. For me it doesn't work as well as the rx meds, but it takes the edge off my moods enough so that I can live a normal life, and it doesn't have any physical side effects. When I first started taking it, I had incredibly bad, vivid nightmares, but that only lasted for a couple of weeks. Going through the bad dreams was worth it for me, my life is bearable now (and the dreams are gone). If you have depression and/or anxiety problems, I recommend trying this out! It does help with my ADHD too, just not as much."
1,Not for me,"This seems to work for a lot of people but not for me. I didn't notice a difference in my mood. I did have terrible stomach pain while taking these so I stopped. Yes, I did follow the directions. I had high hopes!"
1,Gooey and broken tablets. $5.00 rebate offered.,"I got a box that had two gooey tablets and several that were cracked in half. Nature Made told me they were probably exposed to high heat before I purchased them at CVS. Instead of giving me a refund, they offered me a $5.00 coupon IF I returned the capsules to them at my own expense. The letter I received from the company customer representative didn't even bare a last name -- just an initial. Talk about unsafe, cheap, and tacky. I'm going to send the tablets to the F.D.A. instead. Avoid Nature Made products."
5,Love my Nature Made SAM-e,I've tried numerous other brands of SAM-e and always end up coming back to Nature Made. I've been taking it for years. My knees feel better when I'm taking it and it also helps with my mood....true story. .
3,pricey lesson learned,"I heard all the hype about SAM-e and my daughter really wanted to give it a try also. I gave it 3 stars for her because she says its working for her,shes feeling better, but I won't buy it again. It never worked for me. I even tried doubling up on the amount.I give it a big fat ZERO! It cost a lot of money for a whole lotta nothing!"
2,Not as good as advertized,I have taken one everyday sence I recived them and can NOT tell that I feel a bit different
2,don't know,"all thangs act difrent on every one, all thos i was getting more energy with this product i was acting grouchy to my lady so i had to stop taking it..."
1,Does NOT work! Does NOT even break down in your system! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,I took this supplement under the encouragement of my health care provider.After 3 weeks with ZERO results I happened to notice after I had a bowel movement a SOLID SAMe pill in the bowl.Who knows whats actually in this garbage that cost close to $30 a package! Typical corporate greed poisoning the public.
3,price is fair!,"I purchased this for 32.98 in november which was a good deal, however after a week the price went to 42.00!!!!"
1,Did nothing,"Did absolutely nothing I took it for about a month spent about $50 on a month supply and did nothing. This useless Crap should be taken off the market, don't waste your hard earned money on this gimmic because most of the symptoms it is supposed to cure are mental. If you think it will work it will. Its all in your head. Believe me these are just expensive placebo's."
5,EXELENT,It fits very well in my chevy trailblazer and covers all the surfaces in a good way.Now i can protect the rear carpet and keep it clean.
5,Husky,I bought this for my brother as a birthday gift. He put it in his truck as soon as he received it! I liked it so much that I bought one for my Jeep Liberty! The price was nice too.
4,My Calculus Textbook: A Necessary Evil,"Buying this book was easy and great! Reading it and working through it.... not so much. Being a student here at Harvard, I know Robin Gottlieb personally and I can really see her persona come through in her textbook. Many of the key concepts and theorems and problems are written in a sort of prose form, which gives the textbook the unique characteristic of reading like a novel. I still don't know if I like this approach. Also, I feel like the material is extremely watered-down and we're being taught on a 7th grade level, but that's probably just my class, regardless of the textbook we use. The book itself is pretty heavy, thick, & substantial. And yes, even here at Harvard I will get laughed at for lugging around this huge chunk of text."
3,Great Voice - Mediocre Production,"Don't expect silly Santa Claus or Rudolph tunes here. Robin Gibb has taken some of Christmas' most revered Holiday songs and showcased them with his unique, melancholy voice. An added additon is his new song, ""Mother Of Love"", a tearjerker if ever there was one. Although some of these classics could have used more orchestration, more production, backing vocals and less techno-beat, Robin still manages to provide the Christmas atmosphere of holy reverence. This disc includes an additional ""Robin Welcome""."
5,So beautifully uplifting,"I am deeply moved by the depth of emotion that Robin Gibb has invoked into these Christmas carols. I just love playing them over and over, and daily, and it is nearly 9 months until Christmas season!There is such sincerity, strength and faith in his voice and I deeply resonate with the peace distilled in these arrangements.Robin's spirituality brings through the essence of himself, and this is a gift to all of us.I enjoy hearing each track, and ""Once in Royal David's City"" brings Robin's harmoniously distinctive voice to us with this truly beautiful carol sung so gently.Do yourself a favour and play RG's favourite and uplifting carols as often as I do.The short personal message DVD is a treasure indeed and surely adds to the joy of this collection."
4,Read the Diagram - 2ND Table - NO hardware!!!!!,"Changed opinion, Second table came WITHOUT HARDWARE!!!!!!Yes, one ""vine"" plate was misdrilled too close to the edge and we hope it will not be a future problem. However, we had NO problem putting the table together and like the looks of the table. The ""vine"" plates are two different sizes that need to be placed opposite the same size - easy to miss if the digram is not looked at first - we saw it before we started to put the table together - no problems. Looks great with the matching chairs - too bad more chairs are not available."
1,i hate this book,"This book is very confusing. There are too many caracters, their descriptions where not specific and very confusing. I think that is is weird how the author uses foods to describe the way the caracters felt. The book has nothing exciting to make you wish to continue reading. Do not waste your money on this book."
1,Bad Ending to a Mediocre Series,"None of the books in the Stefan Kumansky series are good but this is the worst. The book is dull, the plot drags and the characters are boring. I struggled to even finish this book. By the time it drags to the messy & predictable ending, I simply didn't care.Despite the tie-in to the events of the Storm of Chaos, this book offers little to nothing for fans of Warhammer RPG.Don't waste your time, there is better Warhammer fiction."
5,Such a bold and successful undertaking,"I just watched the 2-part video documentary on the making of this album, and I got to hear songs from it when I just saw the Smithereens live. Also, the album itself is really accurate, down to the last detail. I was surprised, and impressed. Even if I wasn't such a huge Smithereens fan, I think I could still appreciate such an undertaking as really bold and amazing. I think even our parents (the original Beatles fans) could enjoy this album!"
5,Smithereens - Meet the Beatles! FANTASTIC!,This CD is FANTASTIC! I want more albums covered and live tour too! :)
5,Another great one from the Smithereens!,"Being a fan of both the Smithereens and the Beatles, this REALLY made my day. Excellent renditions of the classic tunes by another classic band!"
5,Gotta love Pat and the boys,I've been a Smithereens fan since the Blood and Roses days when they actually got some airplay on the radio (at least on the NY stations).This album is a lot of fun... getting to here inimately familiar songs interpreted by Pat's fabulous voice and the rest of the Smithereens. I could listen to Pat sing the phone book.You won't be disappointed.
4,Interesting Tribute,"While the approach to each song is similar to those on the original album, the Smithereens give the listener an opportunity to re-hear the music (some of us) grew up on. It's easy to miss the intricacy of each tune as the now iconic songs are all too familar. Listening to the Smithereens' version, it's possible to dissect and rediscover this seemingly simplistic music and the budding genius behind it."
1,Save your money and get the originals!,"There is not enough ""U""'s in suck to rate this CD. I remember when this group was rockin' with some songs they made classics, why did they have to butcher the Beatles? I guess as covers go, I like to hear a different take on an original, not a try to see how close you can get to the original. If I want to hear these songs, I'll listen to the Beatles!"
2,Disappointing,"Almost just ordinary tribute-band stuff--mimicry....not adventurous enough, not different enough from the original album to even call it a reinterpretation. Just left me wanting to hear the original Beatles album again (which, granted, isn't an entirely worthless effect)."
5,For Your Listening Pleasure,"This cd is an absolute delight. It takes a lot of guts to cover a Beatles song, much less an entire album and The Smithereens do it exceptionally well. It's easy to discern the influence The Beatles had over The Smithereens because you can pick up the enthusiasm that Pat, Jim, Dennis, and Mike play each song with. I couldn't recommend this cd more to Beatles and Smithereens fans alike."
1,So What!,"I HATE The Beatles. I LOVE The Smithereens. This project just cancels itself out for me. Sure The Smithereens can do whatever they want, but I sure as hell will never listen to this. I'm too busy running out of grocery stores when yet another Beatles tune gets forced into my aural space. Beatles fans. Ugh."
5,Brilliant.........Top notch Beatles Tribute by a top notch band.,"This CD release is by far the best Beatles Tribute by a great group of guys. Pat, Jimmy, Dennis, and Thrilla do a spot on job with capturing the sound and feel of the Beatles first Capitol LP. AS a fellow musician and Beatles Fan, I appreciate the excellent vocal work from Pat, Jim, & Dennis, not to mention the perfection in the backing tracks. The Smithereens have always been a band that can produce excellent cover versions of Beatles tracks (One After 909, I Want To Tell You, It Don't Come Easy). I would (and have)recommend this to anyone who is a Beatles or Smithereens fan. I hope they consider to do this again...maybe a tribute to the WHO next time!!!!This is truly a labor of love from the Smithereens and I highly recommend it !!!!!"
2,worth viewing at least once,"I watched the first Prom Night and thought that it was real disappointing. Prom Night 2 came on TV one night and I figured I would watch it due to people teling me that it was better than the first. Well, it is better than the first but the plot is not that great and the only things that really hold your interest are the few action sequences and what little of the film relates to the first Prom Night. I would only recommend veiwing this film if you are interested in what happens after the original."
2,Stinks,I bought this as a replacement for my broken after 6 months Toshiba DVD player. The quality was noticeably worse. The only thing good about it was it can play so many formats. So after about 4 months I bought the Toshiba HD DVD A-3 and it is the best upconverter out of all of them. Shouldn't have wasted my time with the LG.
2,Busted,"At first we were happy with this DVD player. It seemed to play most DVD's including recorded ones just fine and it was pretty quick to respond to comands for it unlike some other models.However after a short time of moderate use, the sound just flat out stopped working. Then some sound came and it was just a loud garbaled noise. After that, the picture stopped working to boot.So now we have to deal with LG since its over 30 days. Not sure how that will go but it is a real shame we are having to go through that process. In the past we have been happy with LG, so I do not know if it is this model or if we just got a lemon."
3,Not for toddler books.,"I love books by John Butler (especially ""If you seen a kitten""), but this book was more for younger kids (age 6 and up). I have a 1 year old and a 3 year old and I thought this book were for toddler. Needless to say, I couldn't even get through 2 pages of this book for my toddlers. I will have to wait until they grow older. Illustration was cute, I'm sure they loved it, but I had a different expectation when I had purchased this book thinking it would be something similar to his other toddler books."
3,"Very enjoyable, but AWFUL, DEPRESSING ENDING","I don't really know how to rate this... I though both seasons were extremely funny and cute, but the ending is SO DEPRESSING, I just can't recommend the series. There should be a law against putting an ending like this on what is essentially an ecchi comedy. I mean, what a DOWNER! I'm going to be depressed for the rest of the month. Who needs it? If I want to be depressed I'll watch PBS."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"If you want to understand more about your diabetes or are thinking of buying this book for a loved one who has diabetes, do not buy this book. It is written as if someone entered the entire book into an online language translator.(Si usted desea entender más sobre su diabetes o está pensando en comprar este libro para un ser querido quién tiene diabetes, no compre este libro. Se escribe como si alguien entrara el libro entero en un traductor de lenguas automatizado.)"
4,great product,good quality monitor- only complaint is that it changed the position of the headrest to where it is unusable as a headrest while driving.
5,One of the best on the subject,I have read many books on New Testament criticism.This is definitely one of the best.
4,Highly recommended,"This fascinating, scholarly book dissects the aspects of the Christ myth, searching for an historical Jesus. Guiding us through the birth narratives, early childhood fables, Jesus' time of teaching, his betrayal, death and resurrection, Price finds that the evidence for validity is scant. The most damning evidence against historicity, and clearly outlined in this book, is the fact that every part of the Jesus story is lifted from another source. The idea that Jesus was god, born of a virgin, a miracle-worker, teacher, died on the cross and resurrected is told to us, not in any original words, but by simply cutting and pasting earlier testimonies of other gods and other events into the Jesus narrative. If Jesus really did walk the earth and do all he is purported to do, why did his chroniclers explain him only in borrowed words? Highly recommended reading."
2,Facts versus Faith,"After reading the book, I feel that the author missing the point about the most important thing about the Bible, and God/Jesus: FaithThe spiritual aspects of Christianity are clouded (even in the Bible) because it is about the personal experience or journey that each person must travel.Good writing, just lots of gaps or assumptions based on the lack of data. Just look at Pauls dealings with the Gnostic Christians even in his own time."
1,Destructive,"Why someone would read this and believe it over a book that tells of someone that loves you more than you can emagine is a mystery to me, but thats the best thing about Jehovah, he gives you a choice, use it well."
3,"Good for the $, but fringe reception","I found this radio to be a poor performer when trying to tune in weak stations that I can get with my home or car radio. Stations with strong signals come in clear. The headphones work well, and the size is good. The belt clip is a little weak. A good radio for the $ if your favorite stations have a good strong signal."
3,CHRISTIE,Barbie Butterfly Art CHRISTIE AA Doll (1998)This will be my first time with her I did not get a chance when I was I girlShe is beautiful and I can't wait to have her
4,Why?,"This particular black Barbie has such a beautiful face mold. I DON'T like the old bodies that Barbie used to have, but for the sake of having this face (I'd probably exchange it with another body) I would purchase her again. I am tired of having my black Barbies look like spray-painted white Barbies... can't the black Barbie have her own identity?That's why I'm excited about the S.I.S. line coming out soon!"
1,Do not buy!,"Thought this was a semi-stylish unit that had the dual alarm and backup features that I wanted, however, I soon found out that the radio had stopped working and so had to use the regular alarm. This has to be the world's most annoying sound since Jim Carrey screeched in ""Dumb and Dumber"". The Beep, Beep, Beep gets louder and louder until the entire neighborhood is waking up with you! In addition, the clock sometimes decides to just shut down for awhile until it feels like waking up. Please stay away from this product!"
3,Alarm could be louder,I like the auto set time feature but think the alarm could be louder. It starts off quite low but will increase in volume as you let it go. I guess for some that might be a cool feature but not for me.
3,Comfortable but small,"I bought this Thong in two colors. The shoes are ok and really beautiful...but so small, I coudn't use it. I'm size ten and I bought 11, and there's still small. I recomend at least, get one more size."
1,Stopped Working,Motor stopped working after 2min of run time. Does not respond at all to voltage input. Just buy the stock 20T motor.
2,Crabb Family Fest Live 2003,"I truly like a few songs on here, but there was one guy on here who seems to dominate all of the music I didn't care for him at all he seemed like a phony or came across as one, that's a shame they are all great singers, the kid needs to step back and not try to be the center of it all, for me ruins the whole album."
5,Good solid two stager,"I recently got back into model rockets and this is the first multi-stage rocket I had built and flown since I was a teenager. It was easy to assemble and soars with two D engines in it. You will need a *very* large area to recover this one. I had two launches on it, the second launch was unrecoverable as it caught a breeze up at 1800'-2000' and floated far beyond recovery range. Our launch area was about 1000'x1750' before the trees crept in.I deviated a bit on the instructions, I used the bottom engine mount on the top stage to slot into the booster stage I glued it so that half of the mount was protruding. Slide it into the booster stage and sanded it so that it wasn't snug to ensure a clean separation.It had a really nice solid flight straight up, no instability. I'll likely get another one, but I'll be launching it in a larger area."
2,Not Believable,Just the run of the mill phsyco cop. Would have been better if he redeemed himself instead of dying a violent but again non-realistic death
2,Staggered to the finish line,"This movie started out pretty entertaining but it just kept going on and on and on for what seemed like 3 1/2 hours. I found myself saying, ""Ok, we get the point now come on!"" They drug it out too long to a completely predictable finish. I give the first half a 3 and the second half a 1 = a two star rating."
2,Unsatisfying,"This is a movie I originally wanted to see in theaters but didn't get around to it. I finally rented the movie a week ago and I was very unsatisfied with the film. After the credits rolled, I felt like a desire for more answers to certain questions or just simply wanting more.Sam Jackson is (always) excellent as the cop as is the other actors. I guess I was really expecting more with this film and it wasn't what I thought."
2,not to good,dvd came but case had a knife cut on it and this was suposed to be knew but looked used but dvd played well.
3,Not a bad film,"This wasn't a bad movie, although I could have done without seeing it. It was somewhat entertaining but didn't seem to hold my interest as much as I would have liked."
3,Lakeview Terrace (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray],"Samuel Jackson is an excellent actor. Some blacks may not like who he portrays in this movie, a rascist role similar to one he did in Die Hard with a Vengeance. Like it or not there are rascist and they come in all colors. Neither is mutually exclusive. Here he terrorizes a couple because he has power as a police officer. Realizing that it is easy to see and feel how a black person being terrorized the same way would feel. Keep an open mind and most people should appreciate the real message. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. That said, this movie strings you along and then the ending is so typical you may wonder why you spent the time on this movie. If it wasn't for Jackson's acting you probably would not have wasted your time watching the whole thing. So kudos to Jackson and thumbs down to LaBute for unoriginal ending. If you enjoyed this catchBody of Lies (+ Digital Copy and BD Live) [Blu-ray].CA Luster"
4,"Save it for your ""to rent"" list","While this is a great movie and the actors/actresses do a wonderful job in their roles, I felt this was one of those movies in which the previews gave it all away. Good movie to watch once, but not one of those to watch over and over again."
3,uneven fare,"TO start off with, I am a huge fan of Samuel L Jackson, and was really hoping this film would be better than it was. The pace is slow, due to the development of the characters no doubt, but it never seems to really take off. The new neighbors are a interracial couple and this does not set well with Jackson's character, who is once again a over zealous cop. First, I doubt any single cops in L.A raising two children live in a trendy little complex that this film is set in. Second, I found it hard to believe that of all the crime and violence he sees daily, the one thing that drives him over the edge is his neighbors, escpecially the interracial thing. To me it could have been better, but to each his own."
2,I liked this movie the first time when it was unlawful entry,"Let's keep this short ,1992s unlawful entry with Kurt Russel and Ray Liotta was a better film"
1,Another stupid RACIST movie,"here is another stupid RACIST movie. I am very disappointed in Mr. Jackson being aligned with this whole production. He must have needed the money.Weak characters. weak plot. RACISM at it's finest. Mr. Martin Luther King must be rolling over in his grave. Mr. Jackson and Mr. Glass, you should be a shamed. the idea is to do away with racism not promote it. People, liberals, Conservatives wonder why we all can't just get along, it is because of stereotypical crap like this.it did have ENGLISH closed captions, that is the only good thing i can say about this movie.do not waste your money or your time on this one. it just stinks."
3,There's a limit,"to how bad anything Samuel L. Jackson is in can be. But this was testing those limits.1. How often do you see black men go off the deep end about black women dating white men? What is the probability that that would happen (black women/ white man marriages are very rare) and that a demented cop's wife would have died after engaging in an affair with a white guy?2. The acting was decent but not quite enough to cover a very thin plot.This movie is worth seeing as a matinee or a movie rental (better), but it not as good as some of Jackson's best work (Pulp Fiction).Maybe the movie could have come together more solidly with a better director or better scripting. It is not that the movie was horrible. Far from it. It was very watchable-- but it just didn't have the certain something extra that separates very good movies from mediocre ones."
2,Not that good,I'd pass on watching Lakeview Terrace. It isn't one of Jackson's better films. It is way to predictable and the actors just don't deliver. I'm glad I just rented instead of buying.
2,Please pass over this...even if you are a Jackson fan,"Even though I love Samuel Jackson, I thought this was one of his lamest movies. I wonder why he even bothered to do it. I guess he needed the money?This movie reminded me a little of Unlawful Entry with Kurt Russell, which also took place in CA.I really wanted to like this movie, I truly did. It's been a while since I've seen it to leave a thorough review, but all I can say is this one was pretty bad as far as bad movies go. This movie might be ok to watch on a rainy day."
2,"Lakeview Terrace,wished the movie was as good as the title.","Saw it and i didn't like it reminded me of the movie Unlawful Entry with Kurt Russell and Ray Liotta which was by far,better than this.Gotta watch out for those on and off duty neighborhood live-in cops you never know?"
3,the nightmare neighbor from hell,"In California sometimes it seems like no one knows their next door neighbors.Here they get to know the burnt out copjust as their house is about to be burnt out by a brush fire?The black on white element just adds to the hate theme,but I doubt that it is necessary to the plot.I've seen nearly the same plot with a white cop next door.Some people just can't let their neighbors livein peace?I didn't like the movie but it is well scripted and acted."
4,fences don't always make good neighbors,Good movie. Samuel Jackson takes you there and makes you want to slap him silly. Good cast. Makes you think about you own prejuidces about people living next door to you.
4,"Interesting, but not one to own.","My wife and I saw this movie the other day and to be honest ever since I saw ""Snakes on a plane"" everytime I see a Samuel Jackson movie I can't help but think of how terrible that movie was. So I admit that I am a bit biased now when I see his movies.But to be fair, the movie was good. It's the typical drama where you have a psycho neighbor. It wasn't what I thought the previews reflected, that being more horror/killer type. The movie was instead somewhat psychological with some terrible action. Throughout the movie we were both engaged and the movie wasn't half bad. Would I recommend watching this? Sure, it's entertaining and a decent movie when there is nothing else to watch. Would I buy it? Probably not as it's definitely not a ""keeper"" in my eyes."
2,Metaphors in mind,"Metaphors in Mind: Transformation through Symbolic ModellingI think the ideas in the book are interesting. The examples in the transcripts of the use of clean language in facilitating change in clients is way to rote and formulaic to be used in counselling. Maybe people who facilate in these ways don't call themselves therapists, but clean language facilitators. So I was let down by the book for this reason."
3,Recomended for fans of ...,"As typical with Playboy Video Centerfolds, this DVD has the Playmate of the Year, Julie Ciliani, featured through the first 40 minutes of the DVD, and then the runner-up, Elisa Bridges, is featured in the last 15 minutes.For Julie, there are 9 video segments of her, 6 in which she strips down in the buff, each running from 3 to 6 minutes. One segment consists of still frames from her centerfold pictorial and Playmate of the Year layout.For runner-up Elisa, she has 5 total segments, 4 are videos, 1 is her pictorial from the magazine layout.This DVD can be recommended for fans of these two girls. There are no other Playmates on this DVD, so if you're not a fan of either one, don't get this DVD.If you aren't familiar with Julie or Elisa, check out the Playboy 1996 Video Calendar, where both of them appear with 2 video segments each that are taken from this DVD."
2,Unstable,"+ Good quality ceramic+ Proper size for taking direct shots from most espresso machines+ Handles are well designed for care-free holding. No ""pinching"" with thumb and forefinger needed to keep cup steady in the hand.+ nice aeasthetic design.- Biggest minus is stability is sacrificed for aesthetics. I have to walk a ways each morning with espresso in hand so with a narrow base, the cup is unsteady and tips a little easier.- Again, related to stability is that stirring in sugar requires attention.Seems like nit-picks, but because of day-in and day-out use, I went ahead and purchased the Moka brand espresso cups. They are a bit thicker so stay hotter longer too. By comparison, the only down side is that their handles are smaller and need a tad more pinching to hold cup steady.European Gift and Houseware 020 Italian Style Moka Cafe Espresso Cups, 2-1/2-Ounce, Set of 6"
2,It's ok but...,"This cup is a little thick. I like thin espresso cups. I returned it and got something from a store, not online."
4,Excellent,Solid and stylish. Came in sturdy packaging that I have to admit was a worry but items arrived all in one piece.
5,LOLLI DRUM is a hit with my 4 yr old daughter!!,This is super cute and nice quality!! My 4 yr old daughter loves it! Bought a second one for my neighbor's kid for Christmas.
4,Good introduction to options trading,The book works for me. I enjoyed the book as it brought some new ideas to me and helped cement some of the concepts that I had struggled with. I had purchased other books that seemed too technical in nature for me.The book is introductory in nature but it as least not a sales pitch. I have read some of the glowing reviews on Amazon and agree with those opinions. Fontanills covers the basics and gives a foundation to move forward.Good book. Better than most
2,Roller Coaster,"This is an educational roller coaster, and that isn't a compliment. It starts slow with antecdotal stories of Mr. Fontanills' experiences as a business person and options trader. It then gives you a peak at the promised pot of gold - delta neutral trading. But, to prepare you to understand delta neutral trading, it bumpilly and joltingly takes you through an Options 101 course. Thomsett does a much more thorough job of that, if you need a basic understanding of options. The first 137 pages supposedly give you the background to understand the last 100 pages. But, BAM, it's a drop off into a dark hole! It jumps from using options as its example base, to using futures. The terminology changes, the charts and graphs change, and any practical application is lost in its switching investment instruments and its uneven explanations. The most important information - delta neutral trading - was delivered encrypted at Mach 2 speed. Pass on this one."
1,Beware,"The reviews for this book are all written by the author. I was suckered in an bought this book, but after reading it and rereading the reviews here, I'm convinced that these reviews are all phoney.The book is terrible. The reviews are lies. Don't waste your money."
2,Need Part II,"The book ""The Options Course"" presents some of the technical aspects involved in trading options but does not provide specifics. An example is computing Delta the formula given in the book only yields an approximate result. Also some of the strategies use futures for examples, does that mean that the strategy is to be used for futures only?The book does cover very well entering into a option trade but fails to provide an exit(when and if necessary) strategy.It is a good introduction but I hope that the author comes out with Part II."
2,Pay attention to negative reviews.,"Chapter 15 16 and 17 are the only chapters that prompted me to give this book an extra star.After getting screwed once or twice, you learn how to pick out the the shill's 5 star ratings (look at the reviews of Mark Douglas's books for a classic example). This book is nothing more than a basic review of various options stratagies and when they are applicable. I have been able to find almost all the information in the book free on internet sites. Fontanillis gives little insight on how to use any of these strategies profitably.Just like anything else in life. If a review sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Look to McMillan or Shaeffer to give you more of a ""how to"" on options. Fontanillis did."
5,Must Read for all Options Traders,I saw Fontanills on CNBC and bought his book. It is an easy to understand options book that talks about how to find high profit low risk trades.At last a book on options that is positive and I could understand.
1,this is crap,"this is crap, after reading it you won't understand the first thing about options, some readers wrote or suggested that it is good for begginers, it's lie, get some decent books such as Hull's crap. Hull is considered by the way as an introduction!"
2,The Options Course,"The book was below average, although it can give novice trader a little idea on what options are and how they work. Basically, I was letdown on the topics covered, and how the title exagerates on its claim. Read it if you are a beginner, but not if you are familiar w/options looking for some new strategies."
2,A good place to start but incomplete infromation,"I found this book to be fairly solid in its basic material. However, it was never able to make the jump from a basic overview on options to developing skills you can actually use to pick and place options orders. I have a feeling the author did this on purpose so the reader would then need to purchase his workbook too!"
1,Try to avoid of mathematics.,"First, I read a copy in a library, it might be old. However, the error seems not a typo. Maybe, he is good at investment. Maybe he could teach others how to avoid of mathematics. But if when he is talking in Mathematics, he'd better say it correctly. This guy don't know how to calculate ""Expect Value""! If one use his formula to calculate risk, one may believe he is going to win while he is more likely to lose. So, it might be a good book. But better read it with caution."
2,Avg. at best.,"Not great on information if you have more than a curosry understanding of options. I must admit, however, that many swear by this book--I just didn't get that much out of it. A better, albeit much less entertaining book, is Options as a Strategic Investment. Just be sure that you are purchasing the actual book and NOT the study guide."
5,All I needed to know to start trading - options,I am an avid reader and liked the no nonsense approach of this book. I bought the accompanying book with it which I found useful. Fontanills sets out in an easy to understand format. Goes into the right amount of detail. This is the first book that I read on options that I could understand.Good job!
2,"Not 4 Novices; Stresses Complex, Pricey Strategies","Takes a lot of $$$ to do the complex delta neutral options strategies that are this book's focus. Why not get the most band for the buck by reading Sy Harding's ""Riding the Bear"", which details how the market almost always is weak May 1-Nov 1 and goes up for the most part Nov-April. Then, learn options at the cboe site and optionscentral site plus consider Charles Caes' excellent ""Tools of the Bear"" (which is flexible enough to also guide you in bull markets). John Murphy's wonderful book, ""Charting Made Easy"" gives you the decisive advantage of using technical analysis at a bargain price. After learning from these resources, consider buying puts or calls on the NASDAQ QQQ or on individual stocks. As a tiny investor I am up 75% year-to-date as of June 11, doing the above.Warning: Fontanills writing style is at-times less than clear, beginners should avoid this book. George is a true expert and easy to talk to, but his delta neutral style is pricey."
3,A too optimistic pathway to rich... if there is one...,"Mr. Fontanills provides in this book the foundations for delta neutral trading strategies using options and futures. The book has a quite long (too long in my opinion) introduction on how to get started in the market, in the broadest sense (from the difference between stocks and options, to how to make a good investment....)Afterward, he moves deep into the details of option/future delta neutral strategies. This part is not a 100% easy read, so I would not say it is an absolute beginner book.Although the contents are generally well discussed and presented I would urge you to work with a spreadsheet as companion, where you need to test all the formulas the author propose for break-even and profit. Doing that I found some incogruences.Unfortunately, as a lot of trading books, also this one over indulge in promoting Mr. Fontanills professionale services, but, to be honest, this is less evident than in other books."
4,Good review and helpful assessments,"Read this for an MA course entitled ""Team Leadership for Organizational Optimization."" Nothing new but it's an easy read and Quick offers good insights and many helpful assessments. This book could be used as a helpful maintenance check for leaders and team members."
3,Buy something better,"If you want a good intro to Irish drinking songs, the pub that these lads are playing at is dead."
5,Great CD,"As I stated in the title, it is a great cd. It will definitely get you moving in the morning - praise God."
5,Thoughtful and loveley journal,Well chosen author's quotes inspire a woman to reach and find the essence that is her. One of my favorite journals ever.
1,too sugary,"I was taking a risk with this cereal because the ingredients included two sugars. Unfortunately this cereal is too sugary. Why does ""Health Valley"" have to load their cereals with too much sugar? Anyway, we had to mix it with a no-sugar mainstream cereal to eat it. Sorry, many people like to overdose on sugar but we don't."
4,Nice ExpressCard/54 slot (USB-based) solution,"If you don't have an ExpressCard/54 slot (USB-based) on your notebook, this is the solution.This will charge the MoGo Media Mouse X54 for ExpressCard/54 Laptops (MG-304-01-0002-01).Sturdy build (metal case)."
3,Incorrected advertising item,"They did not ship me the right item. I called them and told them about it, they told me that they will call me back. But they did not honor. I am not satisfying the service. I did want the orginal wax refill( green) instead of orange."
2,Missleading title used by publisher and author.,"More on people psychology than dog behaviors. Very Dissapointed! Reads like a story. Learned more about how humans missread dog behavior than did what actual dog behaviors are, which is what I am looking for. Very wordy. Recommend the Dog Language Encyclopedia by Roger Abrantes."
3,Worth the money but can be hard to follow,"This book definitely increased my understanding of my dogs behaviors and I consider it a good buy. However, the authors tend to bounce back and forth between examples making it hard to follow. Be prepared to flip back in order to connect the beginning of an example with its ending."
2,Not good,"This book I felt was at times difficult to understand, plus the title of this book is misleading. There were some good pionts in the book, but You will be better of trying to look for another book to learn about dogs."
1,Terrible,"Not only does this toy have a funky odor to it as soon as you open the package, but the vibrations are weak at best. I bought this as my second toy and was greatly disappointed. Ladies, do yourself a favor and get a ""Waterproof Delights -Jelly Multi-Speed Vibrator"". Same general price range, but MUCH stronger. :)"
2,Good but...,"I went to put the batteries in, before even using it once, and the cap dropped and it broke. It can still vibrate, kind of. It's very hard to keep it on. It does work but when I'm in the middle it'll turn off and I have to play with the cap to get it vibrating it again. Very hard to play (with yourself or another) and keep the vibrator going. When I got it I kept thinking about how small it seemed but turned out to be a pretty good size. It smells like rubber. If you buy one be careful to not drop it or drop the cap because than the vibrations might not work very well. Also, it's not that loud on the lowest setting but still hearable. On the highest setting it's very loud!"
4,Office 2003 for dummies,Haven't had a chance to use it in the workplace yet but looks really good - easy to follow and easy to find what I need to know
5,Office 2003 for Dummies,I have worked within the MIS/IT arena for the past 30 years. This book is a GREAT value for the money. You have a total of (9) NINE core products reference material at your fingertips. It answers the most common to the most complex tasks of each product.
2,Review,"I've worked with Office 2003 for some time. I was looking for more information on Publisher. Instead got a book of all the basics. Great if you know little about Office 2003, but not much help otherwise."
1,not very pleased,"This book is not for someone who does not have any knowlege about office 2003, infact this book leaves out alot of need to know imformation to even start to understand how to use office. The average user will be lost and confused by the first chapter. I wouldn't tell a friend to buy this book, infact I threw mine in the trash."
5,what i needed,"did the job. it is bright, not used for plant growth, but provides a nice lighting for aquarium. used on a aqueon 25G tank with a lighting ballast that came with the aquarium"
5,Step Reebok the video,"This has been my favorite workout for over five years. I received it as a complementary gift when I bought my Reebok step and I can't find another workout that is as comprehensive that I can use it everyday. I have had three children and this video has been a staple of my post-partum workout. Everyone is very professional and in shape, yet exhibit different body styles and gender! Even my husband likes it. The drumming music is motivating and the cueing(sp?)is easy to follow without having to watch the video closely, a must for people with small children. Overall, an excellent video!"
3,too small,well i bought this costume for my 9 yr old daughter and it was too small if you are a size 0 it will be perfect but she is a size 7 so good luck quality not the best either not too impressed
5,riveting page turner with delicious prose,"What could be better? Mother/daughter relationships, power struggles, royalty, intrigue, sex and a riveting story written in delicious prose. A great debut."
2,Just Silly,"The back of the cover kind of says it all in this book.I was expecting it to be really sexy and have lots of intrigue, but it was quite lacking. I actually had to put this book down, and I rarely do that for any book. The idea that a character could have ""singing bones"" was just too ridiculous for me.Anyway, if you want a sultry and sexy mindless read, go for ""Harem Girl"" instead, this one was just too creepy."
1,It's enough to give you heartburn...,"Mossanen didn't just dip her pen in honey, she dumped the whole honeypot all over the pages, and then added a heavy dose of saccharin. This book will probably end up being made into one of those schmaltzy cable mini-series starring a cast peppered with Hungarian unknowns and actresses like Victoria Principal and Jacqueline Bisset who haven't had much work since the last Judith Krantz mini-series.With so many wonderful books to read, life is too short to waste your time on something like ""Harem"", unless you're sipping a fruity drink with a parasol on some tropical island -- and you've got a couple Tagamet standing by."
2,Interesting,"This book really disappointed me. She ruined an otherwise interesting story line with very graphic sex scenes. While I expected this to be part of the book- given its title- it just went on and on. And on. At the same time, I found the writing to be rather juvenile, and the 'happy ending' just seemed out of place."
2,Misleading,"I read this book in hopes of learning more about life in pre-modern Iran. I was very sadly disappointed as I found this book to be trashy, repetetive and uninformative. After reading The Twentieth Wife and then Feast of Roses about Mughal India by Indu Sundaresan, I couldnt help but be disappointed. Check out these books instead."
4,Harem,"I absolutely loved this story. It is so visual and sensual (as in addresses all the senses)...I could see, smell, taste, and feel so vividly. I loved the story. DLMossanen's writing style at times verged on poetic. I like the way she transitioned the story to focus on each character. Also, her writing style remained consistent throughout the story. It was like a Persian minature in words."
1,Depressing,"To be fair, I never finished the book. I found it to be too graphic, the rape scenes were disturbing ( yes, it IS a muslim country, and it WAS long ago, but still...the girl is only 10 years old ! )and I couldn't sympathise with any of the characters. None of the characters were well developed. Don't get me wrong, I'm not into 'light' books with happy endings, but this book was just too boring and depressing. Gave it a fair chance, then gave up."
2,Don't bother....,"By the middle of the book I could not bear to continue with the passionless and pointless story. Seriously, it was just terrible. The characters are flat and lifeless and all they do seems pointless. The book goes nowhere. I stopped at page 250 and gave the book to charity."
1,Not worth the time,"This novel was very hazy in motives and characters. There seems to be no real plot and no real ending. It's difficult to identify with the characters because there is no insight into their feelings. It's basically just a story with the stage directions and insight into the characters real thoughts or emotions. It seems too superficial to be an in-depth novel of anything. Even the descriptions of the buildings, characters, smells, and environment leaves the reader with no real feeling of being in the city or harem. It was completely disappointing to read with the climax of disappointment at the very poor ending."
1,Good at first....but,"This book starts off really good and seems promising...but then it takes an ugly turn and starts becoming absolutey disgusting! There are explicit sex scenes in this book that go beyond your imaginings. It's almost like you're reading a script for a porn movie, and there were times when I had to put the book down to recover from the author's filty words. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book..don't even bother!!! It's disgusting and nothing but pure trash."
1,"Trash, this is just cliche romantic porn.","I'm so fed up with the cliche porn scenes, so common in trash romance books. I actually guess what i will read. So boring...This is NOT LITERATURE but TRASH PORN."
2,Not so great,"This is a book that implies an interesting read, however after about 100 or so pages it becomes clear you been swindled. The author had a much better time writing this than you will have reading it. I recommend Slammerkin, The Dress Lodger, or The Crimson Petal and the White instead, all of a different era however have much more interesting, better developed characters."
2,Story better painted than read,"I bought this book because the topic seemed so interesting. Her opening is strong, which further encouraged me to read it. I was disappointed to see that the characters didn't develop past the front door of their living quarters. There is nothing likable in any of them, which made the book a chore to finish reading. I kept thinking 'maybe in the next chapter something good will happen.' It never did. This read would have been much much better if the characters did something other than play the part of the harlot- which was all done rather poorly."
4,How unusual -- delightful. . .,"Because I consume most every past and current piece of literary and even more trashy works of fiction that could be deemed ""historical,"" I confess that sometimes I feel I am reading the same story decorated a bit, more or less, but the same. Do not get me wrong, there are many historical works I adore, and many that are better than this novel, but THIS BOOK is so odd, so interestingly unusual! The writing its self, more than the story, enthralls me! But that isn't the take away credit from the story, but I admit the style of the author's prose is what I enjoyed most.This was a very nice refreshing change to the sometimes, most times, monotonous reads in historical fiction (and still historical fiction is my only choice in fiction). If you are not of an artsy nature, you probably will not enjoy the book, but if are, DO pick it up!"
1,HORRIBLE DONT BUY,"My child got this Frog land last year! We sent for the tad poles and they arrived 3 months later. Its now been 1 year of having these tad poles only within the last three months have they gotten back legs. Our frogs in a friends pond have grown 2x's over! We ran out of food and had to send away for more, took over a month to get it! Now in one of our many tedious cleanings of their growing cups one has died! Now I will have to wait another year just to see legs! I think I might go and buy a frog at the pet store!"
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"We bought two of these for our children for Christmas last year. The tadpoles are extra and we ordered two tadpoles for each kit. After much care and concern, all tadpoles died in different stages of development. It was heartbreaking to my kids."
4,Here's an idea!,"HERE'S AN IDEA, TRY CATCHING YOUR OWN FROG IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WAIT OR CHANCE NOT GETTING THE FROGS WHEN ORDERED.I GIVE THIS 4 STARS FOR DURIBILITY BECAUSE IT'S PLACTIC AND GLASS WOULD BE BETTER. AND 4 STARS FOR FUN BECAUSE AFTER A WHILE KIDS MIGHT LOSE INTEREST IN THEIR FROG."
2,"Good concept, poor execution","Cute toy with good instruction booklet except for no phone number. We ordered two tadpoles; they put in the wrong zip, so we never received it. I tried e-mailing them; no response. I finally found a phone number thru the net, and got hold of a person. Pleasant on the phone, but poor service. They told us it would take two weeks to get the replacements out to us: it took four. One tadpole arrived DOA. The other lasted two months, then bit the dust. The replacement second tadpole (supposed to arrive within three weeks) we're still waiting for, three months later."
3,Don't Capture Wild Frogs!!!,"I am considering buying this toy for my daughter and decided to read the reviews page. I was shocked at one of the comments of going out in the wild and catching a wild frog for the habitat. Frog populations, especially leopard frog, are in decline all over the country. Please DO NOT remove wild animals from their native habitat! If you want to purchase an adult frog make sure your local pet store uses captive bred frogs and not those caught in the wild, some states (such as Colorado) even prohibit the sale of native animals. Please do not take a wild creature from its home for your entertainment, they have a place in the wild and that's where they should stay."
3,great gift but frog enviroment needs improving,"My son was given this as a gift last Christmas. We sent the coupon in right away for two tadpoles. It took until February to receive them. Unfortunately one arrived dead, but was replaced by the company at no additional charge. Consumers need to be aware that it has taken upwards of four to five months for each tadpole to ""morph"" into a frog. The surf school is a good enviroment however the air slats in the side of the school weren't designed to keep crickets in. So when feeding time approached, my son had to cover the side airvents with masking tape to prevent food from escaping. His surf school also had a horrible smell, (possible from the plastic) since the day he received it."
1,I wish i could leave ZERO stars...or NEGATIVE stars!,"i have no problem with the Surf Frog Habitat, but the tadpole suppliers, Frog Farm - the ONLY supplier included in the enclosed paperwork - STINKS! i bought this item LAST APRIL for a birthday present and we STILL have no tadpoles - Frog Farm is ingoring me. but they wasted no time cashing my check....buy this product at your own risk!"
4,Very similar to Agatha Christie,"Dr. Andrew Fennimore, an old-fashioned doctor who actually makes house calls, gets drawn into a mystery reminiscent of those written by Agatha Christie. Two sisters own a dollhouse, and before each murder, one of the dolls is murdered exactly as the victim is. Even when the sisters destroy the dollhouse, the murders continue. Although I enjoyed this book very much, it wasn't hard to figure out who the murderer was. Set up like Christie's ""And Then There Were None,"" there was only one person who could logically be the murderer. Still, Robin Hathaway does an excellent job of setting up the main characters: the doctor, his assistants, and the two elderly sisters whose dollhouse becomes so sinister. I easily rooted for Andrew and worried for the sisters."
1,The worst of the series,"I knew in advance what I was getting into...but I couldn't help it...if you think the other Dr. Fenimore mysteries are bad, wait until you read this one...murders keep occuring in a family...the police are virtually non-existent; the family members don't change their routines, hide, or demand protection; Dr. Fenimore doesn't do any detecting of note (as usual)...the plot is ludicrous, the writing is poor, and the money spent on this book is wasted!"
4,Works as expected,"This is a well made mic stand quick release. It seems strong enough to support a medium weight boom and mic, and has very little play when properly connected. You do have to confirm that the locking button fully pops out to insure that your boom or mic is properly and safely attached to the stand."
5,Soundman & musician,These little gems are a must for your equipment box. Anything that mounts on a mic stand allows for a quick setup & flexibility.
3,QC a little lacking,"Amazon did a fine job processing the order and shipping. The product is not quite up to those standards. The screw threads on one of the quick release adapters were poorly cut. I was able to compensate with a file, but there is a danger of crossthreading. I love quick release adapters for changing mics quickly and to avoid tearing up the threads on expensive mics. Chinese manufacturers could learn from the Japanese about quality control."
2,Still Waiting...,"I ordered this book a month ago, and I'm STILL WAITING for it to be shipped! C'mon Amazon, GET IT TOGETHER!!!"
3,All right...could be better,"Has plenty of good pictures and does introduce kids to various places, but it does not really serve well as an atlas. For purposes of teaching the shapes of countries, where mountain ranges are, what the big cities are, and such things one learns from an atlas, this is very poor. The pages are a bit too busy. Less would have been more."
2,The quality of the photographs is nice but not their content,"This DK book has beautiful pictures and colors. The pages layout is nice too. But many images are not suitable for little eyes. That's strange since this a book intended for children. This book is full of pictures of half naked people, various pagan idols, people wearing frightening masks, Lenin's dead body, Michellango's painting of a fully naked man, etc. I'm very disappointed and a bit angry."
3,Chompion dog toy,"My dog loved this toy, but he's a power chewer and it didn't last long. He got his teeth into the hole at the end and proceeded to eat it. My brothers dog has one of these which my dog has played with and this did not happen to that one. So... I'm not sure if this one was made diffferently or of a different material, but it did not last a day. What a shame, as my dog really loved this."
3,its ok,i don't think it going to last more then a thew days.my dogs love to play togher it realy hard to find toys that last .its not a heaveyweight toy.
5,Perfect for our dog!,"We have a cocker spaniel who loves to chew. He chews through tennis balls and other toys like they are going out of style. The people at the pet store said that he wouldn't be able to chew through this and if he does, at all, bring it back. It has been a month and he is still chewing on it like crazy! He loves it! We are buying another :)"
2,Won't stand up to heavy chewers.,"I bought this toy with some trepidation as my 1.5 year old Labrador is extremely skilled at toy dismantling. So far, the only toys that hold up to her abuse are the Nyla Bone Dura Chews. But we recently acquired a Golden that didn't enjoy the Nyla Bones as much, so I gave this one a try. It arrived yesterday, and the Golden loved it. However, he may be more of a chewer than I originally thought, because he was able to chew pieces off within about 30 min. Supervised, we allowed the Lab to have one last hurrah with it, and she completely demolished it (into 1cm square pieces) in about four minutes. Thankfully, it was only $9 or so, but I'm back to the drawing board of Nyla Bones or else."
2,Dog Toy,"I bought this item initially because I liked what it had to say about keeping the teeth and gums healthy. Unfortunately, I don't think my dog liked the taste of chewing on something rubbery. He is a big chewer on rawhide and other dental chewies, but this particular toy is mostly ignored by him unless we throw it around the room and he chases it, or we try to pull it away from him. The idea was a good one. I wish he used it more."
3,"Great, when it works",I get the pit out 3 out of 5 times that I use it. The pit and the cherry has to be in just the right position and the directions don't tell you how to put the cherry in.
2,"the above is not a review, but more like a brochure",Company people should not be able to post fact sheets under reviews. They do not help us make a decision.
2,Disappointed,Very different from other recordings I have heard. Not my cup of tea at all. Will use in the garage sale.
5,Excellent trivia game with a time line twist,"i like the time line twist with this trivia game. instead of having to know the answer exactly, you can guess the date of some event & in the process learn something.i rank this up there with Scattergories & Taboo as top trivia games for a group.note, the Amazon editorial review said this has 1000 cards but it only has 480 which is the same as the Best of Chronology. i paid more for this set thinking it had twice as many cards, but i'm still happy with this game."
3,don't buy if you live in the uk - 2 pin plug!!!,I bought this lamp for photography purposes. I live in the uk and didn't realise the two pin plug - contacted amazon to find right plug adapter for UK and am still trying to solve this problem. very frustrating. I still cannot use this lamp!! one pin in wider than the other at the tip so finding an adapter is extremely difficult. make sure you have the adapter before buying and if you do find it - let me know pleasethanks - jen
5,"Hard, Fast and Intense!","50 Foot Wave is such a great band! Very powerful music!The CD is great: six songs, and they are all very good!The band said it themselves: ""Yes, it's still Kristin singing and playing guitar, but it's not Throwing Muses. 50 Foot Wave is harder, faster, more intense and built from the ground up to be a band to see live"".Well, I can tell you: these songs are definitely hard, fast and intense! All in all a great choice if you like hard, fast and intense music! Highly recommended!"
4,The name fits,"It does. A crashing wall of music that'll knock you over if you're not careful. The new band is like some of the more energetic TM work; listening to it makes me want to listen again to The Curse, a really great live recording of some of Throwing Muses' best. 50 Foot Wave isn't exactly another TM incarnation, but it is high quality Kristin Hersh music. I'd really like to see them live, I bet it's an amazing experience."
4,well played but there is an engineering problem,"I enjoyed the music but was annoyed to find that there is almost no space between cuts-- I don't know what the standard is, but there is less than one second and it comes as a shock. I am using iTunes and if there is a setting I have missed I don't know what it is. I have never had this problem before."
5,Restored a neglected drill press...,"I bought a drill press from one of my neighbors at his garage sale. I paid less than a third of what it costs new. He had used it 3 times in as many years (even lost the chuck key). Unfortunately, his interest in using it far surpassed his interest in maintaining it. It was quite rusty when I bought it. The table, the chuck and the vertical guide post were all very rusty.I thought given the price I'd just live with the rust, but then I saw this stuff at a local woodworker's store and decided to give it a try. It took several applications and some elbow grease, but it has made the press look practically new.Contrary to an earlier reviewer's comments, you don't have to apply this every week. Depending on use, the instructions say once every 4-6 weeks may be enough. As for using a wire brush and a drill for cleaning, what a wonderful suggestion! And while you have it out you can use it to clean your teeth."
2,"If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.","Purchased this product (after reading the positive online reviews here) to remove rust from the table of my Unisaw that had been in unconditioned storage for several years.Let's just say that the results were less than what the manufacturer claims & other reviewer's experiences; it works, but not very well. I used 3 applications of this stuff, & was able to remove about 50% of the surface rust.Now, I'm not suggesting it doesn't work, only that it wasn't a magic fix. After spending a half hour scrubbing the table, & using about half a bottle of this stuff, I figure I could have gotten just as good or better results using another method, like sanding. I'll probably resort to that at this point, & save what's left in the bottle to use as a conditioner once I get the rust removed."
2,What is really working?,"I was disappointed with this product for the following reason: it did not seem to do anything more than lubricate the 3M pad, which I had to heavily wield to remove even light surface oxidation on my jointer. So, I did an experiment, on my Unisaw, which had some evidence of old rusting beneath the wax. I tried this product on part of the top. On another section, I tried paint thinner, that's right, with another piece of the same 3M pad. When I wiped it off --- SURPRIZE: the paint thinner side was BETTER. I did the whole top, and put some good-ol' Turtle wax on it. I only give it the product 2 stars with the hope that it will protect my tools from rusting. We'll see."
4,Road to Hell a Better Title - Brace Yourself!,"I spent the greater part of this past Sunday mesmerized by Stewart's tale. Not since Rick Bragg has there been a more horrific tale of poverty, hate, discrimination, fear, abuse, and I could go on and on, told in such riveting detail. This is the South as it really was, told in unblinking truth and should bring shame to both white and black that such things happen. I am a proud Southerner but I was ashamed. I like so many others sat back and let these things happen. No more."
4,Very Inspirational,"Very interesting read, a real Horatio Alger story. This book really opened my eyes.Very good read."
4,Case Managers Survival Guide,This book has a lot of good ideas in it. Some of the text seems to be a bit wordy. This book had a lot more material in it than previous editions. I ordered a less expensive book thinking it was the 2003 edition and had to send it back as it was an earlier edition and not as complete.
5,a very useful engineering book,"If I ever had to select the best books in Civil Engineering, I wouldn't hesitate to nominate Design of Small Dams among them. A classic book, a must-have publication. Its presentation is concise, yet comprehensive.Every engineer should have a DSD in the office or at home: it can be used for filter design, water flow, field compaction controls and a series of day-to-day technical needs. It is a book not only for dam designers, but to all of those who need a handy book to solve engineering problems."
5,very good book for cream fans!,"i found this book to be very good. however it didn't go as i depth on the equipment as i would have liked. i would have also liked hearing about recording tricks that they used, or things to that extent. nonetheless, it was a very good book which i read in just about three evenings. it's a very informative book and exciting too!"
4,Overall good biograpy of an awsome band.,"This is a good way for someone who was not even alive in the 60's to learn about Cream. You get interviews from all three band members.There is also a time chart of rehearsals and recording sessions. There are sections about each members approach to their instruments and some early history. The book has a lot cool pictures and art work. My only complaint is that the printing on part of the inner sleave is blurred.This is defintely a MUST have for any Clapton, Jack Bruce, or Cream fan."
5,A great old School Cartoon,"Even today scooby is still of the greatest cartoons, and one of the few old school cartoon character that keeps kids entertained. In this video kids get there own version of the olympic games, cartoonized. With great teams such as the Yogi Yahoos, Scooby Doobys and Really Rottens, Kids can't help but fall in love with this tape. and unlike so many of the Scooby tapes out now, this video is all old school, none of that new stuff such as Zoombie Island and Witch's ghost, this movie is less intense and more funny, enjoyable and most inportantly ""OLD SCHOOL"" styled Scooby."
1,I expected more from this book,"As a new manager with a brand new team of employees reporting to me, I was anxious to read couple of books on people management in order to fully understand pros and cons of management. I do have a great mentor but still find it intimidating to ask for every little advice that crosses my mind. I was hoping that this book would provide me with guidance and some answers. I found lots of advices to just be too common sense. I could not say that I have learned anything significant or new from reading this book. Although a quick read, I would say forget this book. If one wants to learn what managing people is really all about, pick up the ""First-Time Manager"" book by L. Belker and G. Topchik and you will not be disappointed at all."
4,Rookie manager,"This is a great first read for a ""rookie Manager"". In fact I don't usually take the time to go back and write a review on any book that I read. But, I was just getting ready to purchase this for a new supervisor that I just hired. This book is responsible for my survival of my first 6 months on the job."
3,"Straightforward, but sparse","The book is clearly written, sustains the reader's interest with a number of case studies, and provides an excellent flow chart which allows the reader to follow the steps of analysis, chapter by chapter. The book is short, however, on providing solutions for some of the problems analyzed in the various case studies. More solutions and perhaps some exercises for the reader to try would have made this a better book. Also, the book tends to gloss over the thornier issues presented by individuals who have power in various organizations and who resist or sabotage attempted solutions to problems--it notes these situations, but does not address ways of dealing with them."
3,"Good information, but a bit basic","Mager's book provides some great foundational information on performance problems in the workplace. However, it seems a bit basic and common sensical when compared to the new books being written on the subject. I looked to this third edition thinking it would have more up-to-date information and revisions and was disappointed when I found that it did not."
2,"I like the book, But I have concerns.","I enjoy reading this book to my son. The rythym and ryhme of the story and the children during their daily activities keep him interested. The concern is that on a page, the 3 babies are in a tub, ( two boys and a girl ) and they have drawn, in half detail, the private parts of a boy and the girl. Since this is a childrens book, small children at that, I think that this is un- called for and inexcusable! I have now put the book up to keep my VERY young son from asking questions that I believe he is too young to be interested in. The book is very good. The illusrators need a lesson in drawing pictures for childrens books. There is enough to worry about in this world."
2,Not the best,Having great interest in the mansions on the Gold Coast and Long Island I purchased this book only to find it was mostly written descriptions w/some history. Pictures were few and far between. A bit on the boring side.
5,Managing change : A simple guide,"Not as detailed as some other books on the market, but better for it. This book offers a simple and practical aproach to dealing with change and for the price is a must have for anyone wanting to know the basics of change managemnent."
4,"Much better than usual, the heroine was normal!!!","It was a pleasure to read. Jane was normal, and overshadowed by her beautiful, unpleasant older sister. But how many of us actually fall in love with our childhood crush, and they with us- so much as to want to marry us, even with our ""unfashionable"" upbringing? Good light reading, and more realistic than the first."
4,inexpensive swiss-made watch,"The watch worked just fine-for 2 weeks, until the battery died. I don't consider that a flaw of the watch, however since it's easy to have the battery replaced."
2,boringly straightforward way to learn world geography,"This game might be good for classroom use, to teach 1st graders and up some basic world geography. For home use, however, it is boring. It's very one dimensional, a very straightforward identify-the-country-on-the-map format. Quite frankly, just opening up a map and pointing and guessing would offer more entertainment, especially if you know a bit about geography. I looked into a bunch of world geography type games and decided this one would be good for my 6-year-old and I to play together. She finds it mildly interesting (but finds the map sorely lacking) and I find it completely dull. I doubt this one is going to get much play time. Invest your money in a good atlas, and maybe a nice photography book of world destinations instead. If I could return this game, I would. A waste of money in my opinion."
5,poems for children,My children grew up with this book and we still know many of the poems by by heart! When I misplaced it I went on line to get a new one and while doing so bought several copies to keep on hand for gifts.
5,great selection of poems,"This is a durable book with some great poetry for children. It is a board book but it is not too bulky. Its a great book to read a cranky boy in the morning, but holds his interest at any time. The illustrations are beautiful. I would recommend it for infants up to age 6 or 7."
5,"Great book for babies and up, great gift too!","A wonderful board book, full of little gems, from beginning to end. A little old-fashioned, but that's part of it's charm. I bought this when my son was born 9 yrs. ago, and it's been through 2 more kids since then. It holds up well, figuratively and literally. **Also, makes a super gift alternative to giving another hunk of plastic junk!**"
3,Poems to Read to the Very Young,"I loved this book when I received a copy for my now 25 year old. I wanted this copy for his new baby daughter.It is nice, and sturdy, so that a child can handle it.It is not an exact duplicate of the old edition, and some of my favorite poems and illustrations by Elouise Wilkins were missing.I don't know the reason for editing the original, but my son and I know the old one from memory.The baby and her Mom don't know the difference, and I managed to pull off a trade and get my old book back!"
4,Wonderful book!,"I loved Poems to Read to the Very Young when I was a child, and it is just as good now! I'm reading it with my 10 month old son, and we love it. I do want to point out that many of the poems and drawings in the original book are not in this board book version. I plan to get the original when my son is old enough not to chew on it."
4,Much better than later works,"As da free john he still had a connection to the truth. His later works he just rambles on about himself. You need the study companion for any illustrations, though."
5,great cool looking shorts,"these are the best shorts i own. very comfy, perfect length not to long or to short they go to just past the bottom of my knee and stay over my knees when i sit down (im 5' 10"" size 32). i bought a couple pairs in grey. as with all carhartts they will last forever."
3,BE AWARE,"The description of these shorts says they are carpenter. They are NOT! If your looking for carpenter then search again. I bought these, and after they had been shipped they sent me an e-mail, and in the product description, it said cargo shorts. I contacted the seller and made them aware of the mistake, Not sure if they will change it though"
1,Save your money - Surf the web,"The author of this book knows very little about Judaism. He ""researched"" the book by surfing the web and paraphrasing a few websites. He admitted this at a book signing I attended after his lack of personal knowledge became obvious to the audience. Imagine his surprise when someone in the audience said she knew one of the webmasters he ""borrowed"" from!"
2,Not Quite Enough,"I found it frustrating to read an ""informational"" book on Judaism and the author provided no prounicaiton guides. Although he used lots of words, the explanations were still lacking. I use the part on the Dreidel as a case in point: A half page ""explanation"" and he never did say what the object was or how it was played.The book, ""What is a Jew?"", by Kertzer is much, much better."
5,This ROCKS!!!!!,"Get this book if you are into old english folklore, ballads, events, festivals -It may say dictionary - but it is a perfect book to just sit sown and graze in - short enough entries, great descriptions, and WOW! as far as love of Old England etall - Definately should be had by anyone who sings, writes, reads, dreams, re-enactment groups - (SCA, Renn Faires, etc)Totally Jolly and well researched! Wanted MORE!!!!Totally worth whatever you pay for it -"
1,Good writer? I don't think so,I bought this based on the rave reviews. What I found instead was a book that lacked details and failed to give any valid justification for the actions of the IRA. Don't waste your money.
1,This is a very biased hash of a book,"The reader from South Antrim might like to know that fragmeisterlived in Northern Ireland for 22 years (and was in fact born there), and thus he knows what he's talking about...this last reader's comments shows that he is living on a different planet (albeit on the same one as Gerry Adams) His assertions about the majority of people in NI wanting to escape the evil english are wrong - polls have shown consistently that 70% of people in NI, both Protestant and Catholic support the Union - something that Gerry Adams and the Republican movement still has no explanation for. Gerry Adams is no hero (and in fact is rightly despised by a majority of the people of NI), and the sooner people realise it (especially Americans) the better."
2,Interesting but very derivative,"This film deals with some bold subjects, but it is extremely similar to Gus Van Sant's film, ""Elephant"". The style and setting copies Van Sant's film so closely that it really drew me out of the film. The problems of the various students were also rather meledramatic. Not nearly as good a film as Elephant."
1,Garbage.,"This movie takes after Gus van Sant's direction in his movies. Two of the six characters were actually original, the others have been used or so well trodden they are irritating. The movie also spends an absurd amount of time showcasing the suicide at the end. Moreover, the movie is less about detailing the lives kids in school and more about homosexuality and how oppressed they are.The movie offers you the ending and then back-tracks you through the events that brought the ending about.This movie is horrible. I have watched over 850 movies and this is perhaps one of the five worst movies I have ever seen: Last Days, 305, 2:37, Battlefield Earth, and one movie I will never mention to anyone."
3,okay...,"I think Princess in Love was okay. It wasn't as good as the first two, because Mia is like the voice of reality sometimes. The going always gets tough. I think it would have been better if the ending was a surprise. Not one of those standard endings. I just wish that would happen.But all in all the book was really good. I think it's worth every penny you spend on it."
5,Best of all three!,"So far, book three is the best, in my opinion. I loved how everything ties up at the end. It's perfect. What happens when Mia is with the wrong guy? She doesn't want to hurt his feelings, b/c she's in love with Michael! This book is awesome. I am waiting for book 4 to come out..""Princess in Waiting.."" they don't have it at Amazon yet, but I'm reserving a copy at my bookstore! About this book, it was really great, and I own all three now. I loved this book more than 1 and 2...It seems as if Cabot's writing is improving by the book. I here there is going to be 8 books in the series! Can't wait!"
5,Great Book!,"I just finished reading this book and I have to say that the series just keeps getting better! It deserves more than 5 starts, in my opinion. We learn more about the character of Mia Thermopolis and she appears to be growing more emotionally, yet still staying the same young woman that we all adore. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to laugh and enjoy reading. I can't wait until next Spring when the 4th Volume comes out. This is a definite read and you won't be disappointed in what a treasure these novels are for all teenage girls."
4,Finally its here!,"I've been an absolute fan of these books from the start and readers of the other books (The Princess Diaries, Princess in the Spotlight) will find it as delgihtful and fun as the first two in the series that will hopefully have many more installments.As Mia delves deep into the problem of not liking the boyfriend she's got (and being head over heals for the one she can't have), she works her way through many delightful and terribly true-to-life teenage experiences mixed with a charming 21st century version of pauper to princess experiences that are so realistic, Cabot will have you thinking you've got the story of a real-life princess in your hands as you read.As an 8th grader, there is nothing that could be more fun and entertaining that I can read. A whooping five stars for a book that I read in an afternoon...when I was supposed to be doing my social studies report--it's that good. Be sure you don't have anything planned the afternoon you pick this book up! -Lia"
3,"Oh, my life is so horrible! or the chronicles of a rich brat","That is how I would describe the Princess Diaries series after book two. No longer the hip New Yorker she once was, Mia is now just a nave spoiled brat who doesn't realize that people like her grandmère are probably the best people she will ever meet. Mia's life is so horrible-she has a boyfriend, she gets money donated to a charity everyday in her name, she goes to a nice school, she has a roof over her head, clothes on her back, and food in her stomach. Oh yeah, tough life. Try the life of a regular freshman girl in the middle of the Midwest."
4,Best book in the series,"In the third installment of the Princess Diaries Series Mia finally has a boyfriend. She would be thrilled except he isn't the one she wanted. When her new boyfriend confessed his love for her Mia decides she has to dump him. However, there are many things that keep her from doing this, not the least of which is her desire not to be dateless at the big dance. Mia's guilt begins to eat at her and she has an important trip to Genovia to worry about as well.Princess in Love offers up pretty much the same witty writing and quirky characters that you loved in the first two but is made even more interesting by Mia's love triangle. In the spirit of all princess stories there's a fairy tale ending and Meg Cabot manages to keep it from being cheesy. This is probably my favorite of the series so far. The series has reached a turning point and I'm afraid that after this the series will loose a lot of steam. We'll see..."
5,princess in love,I loved this book it's the best book i have ever read and all i can say is i really really hope theres a book 4 coming soon
1,sucked!,"this book is one of the worst i ahve ever read!! wont mia ever shut up! i mean, all through the other books she is complaining that she ""doesent have a boyfriend"". well, she finally gets one and what does she do? she doesent like him. cant she be gratful? the plot is getting so unbelievible! but, stay clear of the last book, princess in waiting. it was worse than this one."
4,An ok read,"This book was okay. I couldn't wait to read it because I loved the first two books of the series. It was long and got boring with too many details, her mom didn't have the baby in this book either. I was disappointed with the outcome of the book overall, the ending was wonderful however."
5,MEG CABOT IS ADDICTIVE,"If you have any sort of important committments, do not pick up this book because you won't be able to put it down. Mia's adventures in Princess in Love had me laughing out loud until tears ran down my face and people stared at me. And the ending--WOW. If you are having a good day, reward yourself with this book. If you are having a bad day, console yourself with this book. But whatever you do, BUY THIS BOOK AND READ IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN!!! Meg Cabot rocks!"
5,Question,"Okay, I live in Virginia, and everyone seems to have the 3rd book everywhere else, however the 2nd one just came out here, and they said that there ISNT a 3rd one. Can anyone help?"
5,Amazing!!!,I tell lt love the princess diaries. I thought Sebastiano was a great edition....our at least we got to know him better. WONDERFUL!
4,I LOVE THIS BOOK!,"I have just started reading the book and so far, it is amazing. Mia is so comical about her interesting life that she sometimes regrets considering she doesn`t like her boyfriend like she should and her Grandmere drives her crazy and seems to ruine her day as soon as she sees her. You should totally read this book! It is so amazing!"
2,A disappointment,"I have never read the princess' diaries b4,but I was sure volume 3 would be fun.While it had the odd humorous part,really the whole thing was very boring.I recommend All American Girl instead."
3,Not as good as the first two.,"This book was okay, but it was not as good as the first two books. Mia overreacts in this book over the dumbest little things. She is always complaining about snobby cheerleaders but she is a little brat herself. I didn't think it was as exciting as the first two books. It was still readable and somewhat interesting, though. I just hope the next book is better. I found myself wanting to say, ""Get over it Mia, your life is not that bad!"" Hopefully she won't be as whiny and pathetic in the next book."
5,The best by far!,"I am a hugh fan of Meg Cabot and the princess diaries series, and I think that the series should have stoped here! She has never since wrote a princess diaries book as god as she did in this book."
5,A STORY FIT FOR A PRINCESS!,"Well, author Meg Cabot (who also goes under the names Jenny Carroll and Patricia Cabot) has done it again. This splendid series is about Mia, a normal though slightly weird teenager in NYC, who finds out she is the heir to the throne of Genovia, a small European principality. This third installment of the series, the most mature and enjoyable so far, deals mainly with Mia's complicated social life and getting used to herself- as both a princess and a human being. I picked up the book and kept on reading until I was done, with no breaks, including my time on the tredmill. This is a masterpeice, which brings endearing and realistic Mia right to the heart."
5,Perhaps my favorite,"I throughly enjoyed this book. The first one was great, but the second one wasn't too earth-shattering. The reason I liked this book is that it finally tied up some plot lines that have been going from book one. (I won't say what plot lines, I wouldn't want to spoil it.) (You can probably guess anyway.)Unfortunately, this is the last book in the series that I truly loved. Books 4, 4.5, and 5 are pretty stupid at times-- though Meg Cabot still writes with a solid teenage voice."
5,We 'Love' Mia!,"In the 3rd installment 2 the PD series, Mia is trying to figure out ways to break up with her boyfriend, Kenny, because she is still seriously in love with her best friend Lily's brother, Michael. Kenny is crazy about Mia, and frankly, Mia could care less! This is my 2nd favorite book (so far) in the series! A MUST READ!"
5,Timely and well written - Dundon reveals real insight,"The Seeds of Innovation: Cultivating the Synergy that Fosters New Ideas comes at a critical time in the quest for new ideas and breakthrough efficiencies by corporations, small businesses, universities and governments.It is a tour de force of how to inspire and manage innovation. And this is the great value of Elaine Dundon's work -- she presents ""how"" to inspire and manage innovation based on real experience and valuable research. I highly recommend this book."
4,Song Listing:,1 Friends2 Special3 All I Want From You4 She's Better Than Money5 One Step at a Time6 Fill Me Up7 Go Ahead8 Loveline9 Soul to Soul10 O.A.O. Lover
5,Best Of The Jammys/Volume 2,Very good entertainment. All the bands are top notch musical talent with great diverse acts. Dvd arrived quickly and in excellent condition. Good place to shop for music dvds.
2,Bunch of Groupies crowding the stage,"Very disappointed, did not live up to the first at all. Some of the songs are much more brief. In one, there are about 25 people on stage, half which have no purpose it seems. Not worth buying. Get the first one...way better"
1,Didn't work for me for running,"I purchased this item online thinking it was much smaller but it is actually quite large and heavy. It has a clip but when I tried clipping it to my shorts, it was too heavy and bulky. The cassette reception was good but the FM radio reception was terrible - staticky."
4,Philips Scores A Home Run!,"The Philips AT668817 AM/FM Sports Stereo Cassette Player is a definite home run! It's unique styling and water-resistant design is the perfect fit when you want to listen to music while jogging, working out, etc. The radio reception is excellent; the cassette player works very well when subjected to the jolts encountered when moving. It even has a LCD clock! I had been using the Sony Sports Walkman previously, but I have been very happy with this competitor. The only drawback is that the headphones (ear buds that are housed in a holder that fits around the ear) allow a little too much outside noise. But if you are jogging on a public street, this may be a plus for you!"
2,Poor in Circle Fit Section,I was looking another reference in modal analysis using the circle fit method. It is clear that some of the equations in that section are wrong.
4,Not her favorite,The ball is pretty sturdy but it s definitely not her favorite. She almost seems annoyed at the noise it makes and goes for her babble ball instead.
2,Very heavy,"I always buy regular sized toys for my dogs. I have 2 cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier and none of them like to play with this. It just seems too heavy and they cannot cannot get it to make any noises by themselves. They are not weak or gentle with their toys. The jack russell terrier actually likes to shake his head and throw his own toys, but this one is not even worth it to him. Despite the size, I would only recommend this to someone with a large or very strong dog. I also would say that the noise that this toy makes is not anywhere near a giggling sound."
1,"SORRY, CallieGirl, but the ball - HE NO GIGGLE ANYMORE.","This is a heavy weighted rubber ball, but when thrown or dropped THE GIGGLE DIES and all your left with is a sad, annoyed pup who wants to chase the GIGGLING BALL, not the heavy red rubber ball."
2,Dog ball.,For some reason this was not working right from the packaging. Whatever is inside the ball seemed messed up and the ball doesn't do what it is advertized to do. Despite that though my dog LOVES to chew the thing so not a complete bust but for the money I was expecting something different and it wasn't what I wanted.
1,very disappointed,"ball is not what I expected. It has to be shaken very hard for it to make any noise. Doesn't make any noise when rolled or dropped. Dog playing with toy is unable to make it produce noise, and I have a very large dog who likes noisey toys..."
2,"JW Pet Company Giggler Ball Dog Toy, Regular",We did not like this item as the ball was a lot smaller than we thought it would be. When ordering this product we were unable to choose the colour we preferred. The noise mechanism inside the ball broke within a week of our dog playing with it. I would not recommend this item for anybody that has a medium to large dog.
3,JW Pet Giggler Ball Dog Toy,"Got this ball for my destructive Deutsche Dogge (Great Dane). She loves any ball toy. The sound is not consistent (it sometimes makes the odd sound and sometimes it doesn't). The sound is quiet. An hour after she opened it Christmas morning, it makes NO sound, but like all the other JW Pet toys, the ball IS still intact.Love the JW Pet Company products (particularly because they are Made In the USA!!). Although it doesn't make the sound it will work great as a ball to toss and play fetch."
2,Giggle? Notsomuch,"First time we've ever been disappointed in an Amazon-offered dog toy. (And believe me.... our house is FULL of them...!) The ball merely made the noise of ""spare"" or ""loose"" parts knocking around ... not the fun, giggling sound we were anticipating. We bought the ""talking ball"" some time ago, and we (AND our dog!) just loved it. It was a lot of fun watching her chase it around while it ""taunted"" her....! But this one was apparently only defective in its production. I returned it per the return instructions, and had requested a ""replacement"" -- but found I had received a ""credit"" on my account instead. That was a bit disappointing, too.... Maybe there was just an overall problem with the production of this particular toy....?"
5,Neat Toy,"For the price, this toy was amazing. When my daughter plays with it, I sometimes look for the real phone and think it is off the hook, as the sounds are so realistic. It switches between soft and loud volume and between words and songs. The eyes go up and down and it has a little mirror. It is very cute and keeps my 8 mo. old occupied really well. A good purchase for the money. Also, the toy was dropped immediately when removing from the box it came in, on a hard floor no less, and the toy is perfectly fine. Very durable. We like it!"
4,One of the greatest baby toys!,"My first son (who is now 4) received this toy as a shower gift and LOVED it!! He played with it until he was over 2 years old. Then my daughter played with it from 3 months till she turned 2 years old and now my other son plays with it (starting at 2 1/2 months), and he LOVES it! It still works and looks GREAT!!I can honestly only remeber changing the batteries twice!! I highly recomend this WONDERFUL toy! Buy this toy for your kids or as a gift!!"
5,If you can ignore repeative sounds it's the toy for your kid,"My son absolutely loves music and he loves this phone. Although he is only one, he figured out which sounds he likes the most and pushes those buttons over and over. We have dropped it numerous times and it's still going. As far as price goes, it was pretty cheap considering how much kids toys cost these days."
4,Great toy for the car,My daughter loves to play with this phone in the car. She can spend a long time pushing the buttons and watching the eyes blink. I highly recommend it.
5,"Well loved, but not very durable","This is the third phone I have purchased. My children both absolutely love it (which is why I keep buying replacements), but the first 2 I had broke after a few months of use. The phone would make inapproprite sounds for the buttons pushed (i.e. barked when you pushed the cat button, said ""square"" when you pushed the star button, etc.)."
1,just another phone for kids,"It's only one of many phones out there for kids. I think kids are getting bored with phones now. there parents always carry one, they see them every-where,stores parks, pizza places ,etc. I think it's a good tool for learning to count, but that;s all. Kids want computers now , not play phones that they cannot hear anything on ,so they get very bored. That's my opiniion. Computers are where it's at. Even for litttle kids. That;s all they talk about and want from their parents."
2,"Great idea, but too dim","I liked the size, shape and features of the Dana, but the display was too dim and the battery life was nowhere near what was promised in the literature and on the AlphaSmart website."
2,not so nice,This was not so impressive. I got it last year for christmas and i am 10. It looses batteries quickly. It is also very boring and not enjoyable. the only good thing is the word prossing. And for example i lost the cd that comes for synchronizing and now i cant print or anything it comes with too many plugs and ....i deffenataly do NOT recomend this
5,As both a doctoral student and a professional writer...,"...I find this portable word-processor a wonderful gadget. It's a lot tougher than most laptops, as well as lighter and less expensive. Also, the batteries last a lot longer. So I take it with me whenever I don't wish to lug my computer around. I also like the fact it can store up to eight documents, as well as upload the document to almost any word-processing programme on the computer.The one drawback I find is that the machine only works with basic font. It does not have a footnote, italics, bold or underline function -- all of which would be handy. I also suggest you pay the extra and get the built-in rechargeable battery pack as well as the carrying case, since each of these makes the AlphaSmart much more convenient to travel with."
5,AlphaSmart Dana,Nice product at very good buy. Arrived timely and in verygood condition. Will recommend the product as well as theAmazon Shopping experience to everyone!Thank youFrank Frontis
4,Clear and Direct History Writing,"As a public library director with a special interest in the Progressive era, I found Fighting Bob LaFollette by Unger exactly what I seek in history writing. It has the strengths of all solid history in its sources but the author draws on other fields, in particular medicine, to broaden our understanding.More than a century ago, LaFollette said ""We are one people"" and recognized the importance of minority groups shaping their own future. Before the mass media and big money took over political campaigns, Progressive reformers focused on the needs of average people. In three-hour speeches, LaFollette fought for what was needed and was the right thing for the nation to do. The author's direct and clear prose brings the reformer and the times to life. We can learn much from the book for our time."
2,Fighting Bob La Follette: The Righteous Reformer,"Nancy Unger's biography of Robert M. LaFollette, Sr. partially fills the need for a full length biography of one of our country's greatest statesmen.However, a longer book by a LaFollette admirer is still needed. Unger's work is a psycho-biography, short on fact, but long on personal judgements and quotations from LaFollette's critics.LaFollette's life and work do not need such judgement. They do merit a more lengthy and better organized work than this."

3,Close Quarters,"CLOSE QUARTERS is a good murder mystery--a cross between a procedural and a cozy taking place in an English village. It's nice to have a ""Boss"" cop who actually likes and respects his lower-ranking staff. No adversarial relationship for a change."
3,"It's accurate,","The accuracy of the thermometer is great. I tested it in ice water and boiling water and it was accurate within 2 degrees in both cases.My only disappointment is that the remote pager unit does not display the temperature. This is my own fault since on re-reading the description, it only says that the pager can also display a timer. Even there, the pager timer is independent of the one in the main unit, so you have to set both at the same time if you want to see how much time is left from the pager."
1,Wireless range is too short to be useful,"I couldn't get any readings beyond 10 feet, there is no temperature reading on the remote. When the probe burnt out (my fault), I tossed the unit rather than throwing more money into a poorly designed item."
1,Not a wireless thermometer,"A wireless thermometer should, by definition, tell you the temperature wirelessly. This unit does not. It barely beeps when the main unit reaches a preset temp - IF you're not out of range, which mine is when it's 10 feet away. This is not the one you want."
1,Worthless,"Lasted for 3 uses and 6 months, then the display stopped working. New batteries didn't help. On the rare occasion when it actually displays numbers, it won't record the temperature even with the probe plugged in, and the clock/timer is inaccurate.The warranty says it is good for a year, but they want $5.00 to make a claim on a $20 product. I'd rather put $5 toward a decent thermometer from another company."
3,BBQ Thermometer,"The thermometer works pretty much as you would expect. It's easy to set up and use, and there's good range on the wireless remote. My biggest complaint is that the original description said it worked up to 700 degrees, but it turns out that only applies to the probe cable (that seems to be clarified in the description now). You would think that a BBQ thermometer would be able to register higher temperatures -- for measuring the air temperature in the BBQ with the lid on since for certain types of grilling, I'm more concerned with the ""oven"" temperature than the food temperature. It would also be nice if the remote showed the temperature rather than just sounding an alarm when a pre-set temperature is reached."
3,Fanny pack organizer,"I needed an organizer fanny pack for vacations and I like this one but there are a couple of features that could be better.1. The bottom of the pouch is not a squared-off box shape which would make it roomier. The bottom is joined together forming a tight ""V"" versus the typical roomier ""U"" shape.2. The belt clip tends to end up in the middle of my back even though I've changed it a couple of times."
1,The book....,I thought the book was a complete waste. It was of no value. It took a total of 20 minutes to read. I brought the book to my gun club and there was a good round of laughter. Members at the club told me there was a bridge for sale.
1,You already know everything in this book,"This ""book"" (its zerox copies with a binder) tells you nothing you wouldn't know after reloading on mec's for a week. DON'T BUY IT."
5,Incredible resource,"While not a substitute for CAREFULLY learning how to use a MEC reloader, this little book succinctly encapsulates 10 years of the author's experience using MEC reloaders.Full of tips and tricks that will save you a ton of headache. Also comes with a great laminated reference card to keep next to your reloader.Rozek is still selling this item - google it and you'll easily find it."
2,Rent this one before buying!,"I purchased Transformers Beast Wars Transmetals based on the great reviews I read from other Amazon reviewers. After playing it, I wondered if they were talking about the same game.I am a diehard Transformers fan, but the gameplay and lack of characters in this game did not hold my attention for much more than an hour. The fighting engine is probably one of the worst I have ever seen. The camera angles during the fighting sequences sometimes makes it hard to figure out what is going on. The different fighting terrains was a nice touch but it doesnt help the poor gameplay. If you are a fan of the Tekken based fighting games you will be highly disappointed by this title.As far as 3-D fighters go, you are better off with Tekken 3, MK4, Dead or Alive, Soul Blade or Bloody Roar....these games are much more fun for single or multiple players than Tranformers, Beast Wars, Transmetals."
4,review of beast wars by jw,"I thought this game was very fun.It is a game for kids that watch the show on tv.this is agame suitable for kids that are 8,9, and ten.the game is like army men3d."
5,The best game ever,This game helps with some bacic skills. It is good to because it helps with intellegence and it helps with planning stradigy.
5,I Can't Say Enough...,"As a pediatrician myself, I cannot say enough about Touchpoints. It's a must have for both pediatricians and parents. After reading his works, watching his videos, and listening to him speak in person, I have the utmost respect for Terry B. Brazleton and his work. He is a gift to pediatrics and children."
3,Interesting book,"This book was good, but not as good as I thought it would be. I had read one of the newer books about a murder and it was very good."
2,"Improbable plot, annoying reader","As other reviewers have said, the story is improbable. In my opinion, Terri Blackstock's characters have a tendency to behave in ways that make no kind of sense.The most important part of this review, however, is in reference to the audiobook. Stephanie Brush is extremely annoying. I'm trying to decide what is most obnoxious . . . I think it's the way she pronounces the letter d as a very strong t. The more I hear, the more it bugs me. Anyway, there are two audio versions, so I strongly suggest that, if you decide to buy it, you buy the one that ISNT'T read by Stephanie Brush."
4,"Good book, not as involved as her series books though.","I thought it was good, but you didnt get as involved with the characters like you do in her series books. I think she writes series far better than her individual novels. A good, easy going book though."
4,ok,"This book was good, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed others of Terri Blackstock's. It was more predictable than her plot lines usually are."
3,Disappointment with Blackstock,"I just finished reading Emerald Windows and was once again disappointed with Terri Blackstock.The book was full of stereotypes and was just too predictable for my taste. I kept waiting for a surprise to happen and instead I got a modern retelling of ""The Gift of the Magi"" and saw the events happening pages before they did.For people who want good Christian fiction, I would recommend Blackstock's Sun Coast Chronicles--for those who just want a nice story, this is probably as good as any."
3,"WELL CRAFTED, BUT APPROACH WITH CAUTION","I appreciate a good Fiestaware vase as much as the next person, but I must object to the shape. I want a means of storing my flowers upright, not a shameless phallic reference. I have to hide it in the closet whenever I host a Bible Study meeting!From now on I will stick to more tastefully sculpted ceramic vases."
2,Dissapointed,"I bought this for my son for his 4th birthday. I read a few reviews that had said it didn't work when it was opened but figured I would take my chances. My son had played with a different turbo twist game and really enjoyed it so I thought he would love it. I didn't realize it when he opened the toy, but when it is set on the loudest setting (which isn't very loud at all) the voice skips continuously and you cannot understand anything it says. He hardly uses it at all..."
3,Twist & Shout Addition-Yellow,"I bought this toy for use in a special education classroom for students with various disabilities. Although my students have access to Apple computers daily, they still would have liked this toy. One problem that I had is that I bought this product as a previous used toy. I will never do that again, unless I buy the toy at a thrift store or garage sale. I couldn't get the gadget apart to put the batteries in. When I looked the product up on-line, I saw that others had the same complaint about not being able to open the gadget to change the batteries. I had to pay for the shipping for delivery and the return, as this was not included in the free shipping. For the amount I put out, I could have bought a NEW product and probably had FREE shipping. My inexperience with buying items on-line!"
5,This was a Christmas Present,My husband loves anything about trains. He especially loves the music on the train CD's. Enjoy the ride.
5,Good balance of product vs cost,"I did a fair bit of research before buying these cans. I went with these because of a few reasons. 1. Audio-Technica makes some the best headphones out there. 2. The pads were over ear, which is THE only way to go if you listen to music more than an hour at a time. 3. The frequency response was great (5-40,000 Hz), great lows AND highs. 4. Construction was strong and of good quality. 5. All the reviews I read were good or great! You can buy less expensive cans but don't expect the quality to be the same. And you can spend more and get more. But for the price, you get a good deal on these. If your still shopping around I'd recommend reviewing my top 5 against anything out there. Oh, and look to see when they were released. Newer technologies usually have a better product, (usually). Good luck."
3,"Great build & comfort, average sound","These headphones are decent overall, but by no means are they great in the sound department. For $180 I think the sound quality should be better. Where these shine is in build quality and comfort. That being said, the ear pads wore out after about 3 years of ownership, so build quality could be better there. The earcups are nice aluminum, and the headband design is very comfortable on your head.The sound is just too thin, and midrange is just not full bodied like you want from a pair of headphones like these. Thinking purely of sound quality I think you'd be better off with Beyerdynamic DT250's or maybe Shure SRH840's which are also closed.If you desire comfort, and build quality over sound quality at this price point, these are a good purchase."
3,Great sound but HUGE.,"Just received my headphones. Wow. These things are huge. Sound is great but they are just too big. I've never seen such big headphones. They take up both sides of my head. I wish I had checked the size before ordering. My mistake. They are light and comfortable so if you don't mind looking like an idiot you may not be bothered by the size. Contrary to another reviewer, these headphones are definitely noisy to others nearby. My husband kept telling me to turn the volume down. As I mentioned, the sound is great. No doubt the large size helps produce/enables this sound. Still, I can't get over the how big they are. They are going back. P.S. Did I mention these headphones are huge?"
1,Support the Pedophile!,Who cares if this is a good book or not? I lived with gary almy at the Truth and Action Academy. I also saw him for counseling at the Lydia Home. He is a terrible person. He is a pervert and hypocrite. Man made God anyway people. Stop being silly. You are wasting your life.
5,The Gordian Knot,"I think the Gordian Knot is an amaizing book which I will certanly read again. It was definatly worth every penny I saved to buy it! It is a very spine chilling book. Also I would like to comment on the excellent vocabulary that is used.The way it is written and the way it suddenly stops and has ... makes you carry on reading it, which is why I finished reading it in about 1 day!!So I think everyone should buy this book, and will be kept busy for a while! AND ENJOY!!Rochel Beenstock (13)"
2,"The ""Behavior"" Era","I became a hardcore Pethead during early 1990, so seeing this CD reminds me of their ""Performance"" concert and the ""Behavior"" disc. The extended version of ""Jealousy"" is just an addition to the end of the song. It's not really that good of a slow ballad. ""Losing My Mind"" was written for Liza, but she didn't want to record it. The PSB showed that they can work with their own songs, even if intended for other artists. There is little reason to get this disc when the B-side is on ""Alternative."" Still, Petheads may want to have it, just on principle. I mean, I don't regret having a copy. I used to own a poster with this cover on it too!"
1,Over-Engineered,Bought this a year ago and quickly came to the conclusion that this was a major mistake. The buttons and their location are the worst that I have ever seen on an electronics product. There was no apparent thought to ergonomics and it is entirely over-engineered.It takes two hands to activate any feature on the unit. One to keep it from sliding off the nightstand and the other to press the button. I would never buy this again.
3,Button Usability Scores Low,"Overall, this is a good clock radio. I've had it for a almost a year and it hasn't given me any problems. The only thing I dislike about it is that the buttons are in the wrong place and difficult to press. The manufacturers should have spent more time on usability testing..."
3,ClockRadio: 3-stars.,"I would rate this product 5 stars for sound quality, 1 star for workmanship. Also, product box within the shipping box appeared to be slightly crushed at one corner upon receipt. Within one hour of first use, the spring loaded CD lid broke. A small piece of plastic that seemed to have retained the spring broke off some time after the second CD was inserted."
2,Difficult to use,"I felt the unit had good looks and good sound. I killer was the bright display that lit up the whole room. I addition, the unit was very difficult to use even with the manual. It had some silly programming button that took two hands to opperate. Much to difficult to adjust the setting for a clock radio."
4,"I like it, but","I am, for the most part, very pleased with this cd alarm. As other people noted, the button layout is awkward to use. The CD player is pretty quite, reception is good. I can dim the clock down so it doesn't bother me. But WHY would they make it so when you turn off the alarm (and reset it), it BEEPS a loud beep (to confirm you turned it off) and you can't adjust the volume on this beep. It makes no sense to me. I try to slip out of bed without disturbing my wife (we are both light sleepers). The only way around this that I found is to turn the volume down and after an hour it will reset without beeping. This beep sort of makes the second alarm function useless, seeing the second person is already awake from the beep and the volume is down."
4,"Not easy to program, but worth the trouble.","After several months, I am very happy with this Clock Radio. Especially useful are the dual alarms, and the great feature that automatically silences either or both of these alarms on weekend mornings. There are back-up batteries to save you if the power goes off overnight. The speakers are better than most bedside radios, and waking up to any specific CD track of your choice is a treat. Or you can choose a radio station or one of several (all too electronic-sounding) melodies. You can also easily adjust the brightness of the dial, from barely readable to a good nightlight.The trade-off for the cool features is this: it has approximately 19 buttons! So it's complex and a bit counter-intuitive to set up, and you need both hands. If you buy it, don't lose the instructions! Keep them in a bedside drawer, because you will want to check them any time you need to reset anything."

1,Misleading title,"Be warned...this ""article"" is merely a checklist for a swot analysis. It is only 3 or so pages long and offers no insights whatsoever."
1,Finance Intern,"This document is really.......useless! I thought that it might provide a list of items for strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat, which could help me to build up a general framwork for SWOT analysis. However, it's just a step by step check list that teach u how to conduct a SWOT analysis. I guess that it could be easy to find better articles talking about this topic from free sources."
1,"Scott is right, do not buy this","I almost bought the same saw at Rockler w. t-2 for less than 1K. There are many better options, Jet, Unisaw, even Grizzly.Changing arbors for dado use, no mobile base(unisaw one will not fit),ZCT plate(even would be hard to custom make b/c no support on one side and no extention table or legs , less depth of cut and the price is too high."
1,If only she could play,"It is a shame when someone achieves fame for all the wrong reasons. Ms. Boyd is, frankly, not a very good guitarist. Gushing, adoring amateurs mostly cannot tell the difference. Professionals take the ""I'll never tell"" stance. And the myth is born.I gave the book 1 star because I don't like frauds. But, it's an interesting read. It's pretty clear where Liona did much of her ""concertizing."""
2,No Auto Sleep Timer,"Warning if you need the Sleep Timer: I ordered this item specifically because the description stated that it had an Auto Sleep Timer. The photo also shows a button for ""sleep."" However, when I received the item, it did not have the sleep function, even though it is the correct model number. (There is an ""Blue dot"" button where the ""sleep"" button is in the photo.) I can't attest to how the remote works, because I had to return it because I need the sleep function."
1,St ay away,"I have a little different perspective that the other users; I purchased 3 of these computers and additional warranties from Best Buy for Business. Right of the bat, Toshiba did not recognize the Best Buy warranty purchase, so I cancelled the additional warranties. Bad, Bad Move.All 3 computers have the same problem, they randomly lock up and become unusable. I have updated the Bios, all the drivers,scanned for viruses, and kept the XP operating systems up to date. All to minimal avail. The computers would start to perform better (not lock up) and then get back to randomly locking up.What options do I have? Keep sending it back to Toshiba? There isn't any lemon law on computers.In my opinion, I have wasted over 6 grand on unreliable computers. The first reviewer must be a Toshiba planted reviewer.I have no recommendations for other tablets, but only to stay away from this Toshiba. It's not worth the headache."
2,wow(in a bad way),"I had to get this laptop for school and this is what i can say. Processing isnt great, comes with a lot of toshiba utilities which often crash. I used it on a desk most of the time, but after a year of use i noticed whenever i moved it the computer freezes and the fans spin up to 100% speed. I've never had a problem like this with any other laptop. Dells, gateways, sonys, apples are all reccommended far before this one. Small, works when its not frozen, but can play some games. Please go buy an apple and save your money instead of having to buy virus protection and windows necessities. please please please apples computers are worth what you pay and will last a lot longer."
1,Double Trouble,"I had the precursor to this laptop and it was great. This one- not so great. It freezes constantly, it's slow, it gets hot. It wouldn't recognize the AC adapter 50% of the time from day 1. Toshiba would not replace the adapter - wanted me to mail it in for repair. I used my friends adapter - charges and powers up just fine. They still want me to mail it in and want me to pay for a new adapter. Customer service is no help. I will never buy this brand again. Buy a Lenovo x61"
2,"In short, it's better to watch this kind of video clips on the web for free.","If you already have watched this kind of video clips on TV or on the web, this DVD does not offer anything better. It some young guys doing some tricks while riding their dirt bikes. For the first 10 minutes, it's interesting. Then it becomes repetitive and boring. In short, it's better to watch this on the web for free."
5,Separating Reality from the Hype...,"I have found this book to be extremely helpful to me in my independent consulting practice. Understanding what to think about, focus on, and pull together in order to discuss corporate portals with my clients was more than worth the price. I learned much about what to truly expect from the myriad vendor products available; this enabled me to effectively evaluate the products and architecture differences in enterprise portal software solutions. If you want to know the right questions and specific issues to concentrate on when looking for a corporate portal -- this book will be very valuable to you."
2,Don't judge the book by the cover.,"I read the first 4 chapters, find the book to be ridiculously repetitious and it appeared to me that the author's message was constantly and repeatedly ""Corporate Portals are Good for You!"".It is generally an acceptable concept that people who buy a book are already of the belief that the subject matter is either good, or good for them and are sold on the concept looking for supporting facts, strategies, tactics and implementation methods based on the authors expertise. Although this is not a negative review for Heidi's knowledge and ability in the field but it is definitely a very poor review of her writing style for a technical book. I abandoned reading the book after the first four chapters and put my time to better use."
3,Still Not Wealthy...,"There are some great tips in this book for investing for the long term, but the title is misleading. In order to get ""wealthy"" you have to be willing to be cheap and poor for a while. This guy teaches courses at UCLA Extension where this book is the text, so maybe the combination provides more insight into creating wealth. In the meantime, I'm working on Idiot's Guide to Getting Rich. I think if I stopped buying books from Amazon I'd be rich in no time. Hey - a book idea?"
4,very informative and useful,"If you have any questions about how to have a better consciousness when it comes to handling your finances and rethinking your relationship, this is a great book, and it points out where we can spend without realizing where we could potentially be wasting money..I found it very helpful!"
4,Great Customer Service,"Customer service solved all my problems promptly (after I let them know I was having them).As far as the waxer itself... well applying the wax with a roller was very uncomfortable compared to applying it with a stick and it didn't help that the person who was helping me with it was going pretty fast (I'm a man who got this for his back). I would say using the roller was less cool than actually pulling the hair out. However, it did its job the way it was supposed to do and the mess normally associated with waxing was much reduced. The wax itself was very hard to remove afterwards, usually a little oil takes wax off pretty easy but not with this stuff. My skin was sticky and weird feeling for days. So, if they have a wax remover specifically for this application, I would definitely get it because its pretty tacky even for hard wax."
1,Doesn't work at all,"I would not recommend this product to anyone. I wanted a handheld type of a waxer so I could wax easily at home, but this one took too long to warm the wax, and even after that, was super sticky and a mess to apply. Even after you have applied the strip and taken it off, my hands felt really sticky and it was impossible to get rid off. I tried washing multiple times with soap, applied aloe vera and lotion, but the stickiness remained. Moreover, the wax did not work well for my skin, and I had really bad red rashes for almost a week after. The roller could not be cleaned after a single application and I had to throw away the entire package. Very unfortunate."
3,Emphasis on photos,"The title of this book pretty much tells you all you need to know about the subject matter. It is basically a collection of pictures about weird, unusual cars, with some minimal text about when and why they were made; it seems to be weighted a bit toward British and European models. Although for many of the cars there is little information provided beyond a one or two sentence caption for the photo, most of the pictures are quite good, and it is after all only 111 pages. Even the most ardent car enthusiast isn't likely to say ""This book changed my life!"", but if you can find it cheap it's definitely worth paging through a time or two."
3,Contains a publishing error,I would rate the book higher if the book were complete. The 2nd edition text is missing content from chapters 10 and 13; and chapters 11 and 12 are entirely missing. The missing text would be between pages 177 and 224. The publisher has mistakenly included the text from another Dummies title. A reader review from June 2008 appears to indicate no problems before this date. I purchased my text in September 2008. I have notified the publisher of the problem and done an internet search to determine if others have reported this problem. There is a url-link with the correct text but will not publish the link here because it may be a pirated copy online. Do your own search to find the corrections. I hope the publisher will provide the corrections on-line using the Dummies.com website.
2,Could be Designed Better,"These are sturdy and well made, but the six prongs add a lot of metal and take away from the gemstone. That may be the way the heart shape has to be set to make it secure, but I dodn't like it. In addition, the prongs are long which makes the gemstone sit high and away from your ear and they stick out from the earlobe."
5,Cholesterol -the hidden truths,"This is an amazing book.Dr Ravsnkov exposes many flaws in the research that has been done to support the belief that high cholesterol causes heart disease. A very comprehensive approach that enables us to examine the research behind the supposed cholesterol-heart link.In doing this it also acts as a warning to those of us not involved in research, how we cannot always rely on the scientific community to reach an objective conclusion.It becomes clear that we have all been misled about this due to either the incompetence of those involved or their being influenced by commercial pressures to maintain this myth.A very important book that should have been given more public attention."
5,This is THE book that explains the deception around cholesterol,This book takes the simple approach of looking at the actual studies that told us cholesterol was bad for us. The author shows in terms a non-scientist can understand why these studies are flawed or simply non-conclusive.
5,Good reading,"Uffe Ravnskov has been writing about the poor science and alarming side effects of statin use for many years. This is a reproduction of his original work written in Swedish, although it was preceded by other authors who had identified the contradictions and statistical manipulation in their writings. I enjoyed this critique of earlier scientific studies and the powerful body of individuals who have influenced statin use."
2,Biased anti-authority perspective,"I believe what the author is saying, but found the book lacking in the detail and critical thinking needed to prove his conclusions. If you want the fluff, this book delivers. If you want an in-depth critical analysis of the science behind the cholesterol myth, save your money. This book is for the cheerleaders of the ""chloesterol myth bandwagon."" It does not address the scientific issues sufficiently to support a change in current - and I believe wrong - ""chloesterol-centric"" thinking."
1,This is junk,"I, too, used to be a cynic when it came to cholesterol and heart disease, but after personally reading a couple journal papers on this topic, I became convinced that there is indeed a link between bad cholesterol and heart disease. It's dangerous to think that most scientists and doctors are out there to ""get you."" If anyone is greedy, it's this jerk who wrote a book just to make a quick buck and a quick name for himself. Of course, many people also believe that smoking does not increase lung cancer rate. Hey, if you want to die, it's your right. At least in this country (the U.S. of A.) people have freedom."
4,A study on medical 'science',"Ever wonder why dietary recommendations keep changing from week to week? Are you tired of strange jargon-filled criticisms of your diet. Or are you curious about how the American medical establishment manages to spend more per capita that any other country and deliver less?Ravnskov presents a detailed and common-sensical review of the literature on fat and cholesterol. This isn't a diet book, but Ravnskov systematically points out errors, omissions, and distortions that are common in the medical dietary literature.What emerges is a medical 'science' that lacks any credibility and a healthy skepticism about medical advice. The sociology of medicine--its hierarchies and power structure--are hinted at. But Ravnskov is no crank or outsider, and his desire to explain the details and complications of epidemiological studies without oversimplification is refreshing, honest, and winning."
3,Lot of toy for the price,"I bought this car for my son on December 8 2006, it stopped working today the 14th of April. Upon opening up the toy I was able to determine that the wires inside are snapping free which messes up the sound. After stripping and restripping these tiny wires and attempting to get them to stay in place w/o any wire glue and failing! I've decided to buy another one. It's a great sized toy for this amount of money, rolls really fast (which is probably what led to its demise), and says about 7 cute phrases from the movie. Since my son has abused this poor car(throwing down the stairs, slamming into walls at 30 mph and using it as a hammer) I'm not going to claim that it's poorly made. Since he will now have two, I'll make sure he uses the old one poorly and treats the new one with kid gloves and hopefully I won't be reporting back in a few months to say that one bit the dust also!"
1,Not the Best,This car is the ONLY toy my 3-year old son requested for Christmas. My husband and I decided to get it since we knew it was the one thing he truly wanted. He was VERY happy with the car. This is the ONLY reason we did not send it back. The car is NOT worth $55. The overall quality was just poor. The stickers were peeling; it is not very durable and it just looks cheap. Save your money!
4,toy car,I must say I was really impressed with this toy. I bought it as a Christmas gift & my nephew was totally awed. It was a lot bigger than I expected it to be considering how it looked in the photo. A great buy.I had to wrap it quick because everyone kept pressing the buttons to hear the sounds!
2,Not Much Help,I found this more confusing than helpful. It had me looking for screens that did not exist and it jumped around a lot. I finally put the book down and figured it out myself using the XP wizard and help screens. I feel like I wasted my money on this book.
2,Not for dummies at all,"Nothing distinquishes this book from other books I looked at. I had installed a wireless network for four computers at home and had endless trouble - this book was no help at all. To be fair I should point out that no other book was helpful to me either. It's full of jargon that accumulates very quickly so that after two chapters you can't remember what you 'learned' at the beginning. Explanations are terse and leave you feeling stupid since you feel, of course, I should be understanding the book -after all its for dummies - but you don't. I fear the void of good material for home networkers is still to be filled."
3,Helmet is fine,We only use the helmet currently. The water bottle has so strong plastic smell that I will never give my daughter to use. Streamers don't fit my daughter tricycle so I have to wait till she is big enough to get a bike.
4,Somewhere in Texas,"A good helmet. Good fit for my 3 year old Granddauther. If you're buying this to go with the matching My Little Pony bicycle, the bike includes a water bottle and handle streamers so you will have 2 of each with the ones included with the helmet. I would recommend this product."
3,Ok,"Has removable pads on the inside. For a kid that's under 2, those are too tempting to remove, and makes wearing a helmet very uncomfortable. They shouldn't be removable, should be permanent padding. Cute though..."
3,Formula change?,"My love affair with this product is waning. The scent is slightly different from the last bottle I purchased, and the product stung my skin a little bit, which the last batch didn't do, however, the ingredients listed on the bottle are the same as those listed on the previous bottle I purchased. Also, this product is not great for dissolving make-up. I'm moving on to a different cleanser after I've used up this bottle."
3,Effective but noisy,LOve the worklight. Wish it had 1 micron filters and it is way to noisy escpially sice it only moves 400 cfm of air w/ filters insatalled. But it is effective in my small work area.
1,not original songs,did like the remake version of the songsthe sound was very poori wanted the ori alblumdid not like i want buy any more from herebut i love lady t
5,Review,Again it was a Christmas present. The recipient was happy with it as was their familyReceived in good time
4,Good leverage and cutting capability.,Just what I needed to cut wire prep-ing it to strip the outer insulation..I have recommended it to several friends.
4,Lindos recuerdos de mi nines.,Esta comedia me da muchos lindos recuerdos de mi nines. Empese a ver la comedia y me di cuenta de ya no era lo mismo. Todos es comedia que los ninos en aquel entonces copiaban de los adultos. Todo era repetido pero yo nunca lo vi haci en mi nines. Solo tengo 30 anos de edad pero me crie mirandolos. Por eso le di 4 estrella por que ya no era lo mismo. El Chavo siempre va hacer el mejor. ;)
3,Well made but somewhat closed in,"These headphones are a luxury item in that they are well made and very comfortable, They probably need burning in but straight from the box I find them somewhat nasal and closed in compared with Sennheiser HD650. I will report again after 100 hours.They are quite sensitive and can be used straight from a laptop earphone socket which the HD650s can't."
2,Price correction?,"I always read ""Mental Training"" in Shotgun Sports Magazine and this month I decided to buy Michael Keys book. I checked on Amazon.com to see if just maybe they would offer a better price. I was shocked to see the Amizon price listed at $139.95. Shotgun Sports Magazine offers it for $29.95. Am I missing something or is it just a misprint?"
2,"Don't buy it if you have a real 17"" laptop!","Great bag...just like my last one; I loved it. Unfortunately, I'm returning it because they advertise that the laptop compartment is 18 x 12.5 x 2. It is on the bottom, but the top is rounded before your square laptop will fit. So you can carry it exposed, or you can order a different brand bag. Don't be fooled by the manufacturer's specs! Really sucks, because it is a great bag...very versatile, lasts forever. I've wheeled my old one through the winter streets of Minneapolis and Chicago on many occasions...it always arrived looking great, always held all my stuff...you couldn't beat it."
3,Measurements were not very accurate,"Overall, it is the same McKlein bag I had previously which was 16"" wide. This back is a little larger; however it is really less than the 18"" they claim. My 17"" Dell laptop barely fit this newer bag and would not close."
5,This is just what I want,"I was looking for a bigger mobile data storage unit than those 1GB Pen thumb drive in the market to store my video/MP3 collection yet, small enough for me to bring it with me, share with friends. Zoom Drive is just what I am looking for. I am very happy with the ZOOM Drive I have. It let me store about 80 cd into this little device, yet it work like the conveniences of those PEN drive. One things I notice is this device have much higher transfer speed than my USB 512mb flash drive. Its about 4 time quicker to store a 512mb files. Overall, I am very happy with my ZOOM Drive. What is more is this device is so stylish and well build, most of my friends were very impressed and ready to purchase one for their own use."
3,"Not my favorite PS album, but still enjoyable","I guess everyone has their own tastes in music, but for myself I personally LOVE the first two tracks on this cd, ""Friends Advice"" and ""Man With the Right Rhythm."" Another track that both the other reviewer and I do agree on being a good song is ""Insanity"". For those 3 tracks alone, I feel Right Rhythm is worth getting, but just being a big Pointer Sisters fan, I need to give these ladies some love. The album didn't get much commercial success but it should appeal to lovers of old school r&b."
3,overpriced,was expecting a more vintage book for the price. could of picked this up at a yard sale for a tenth of the price.
5,Simply the best book of Children's poems ever,"I was given this book on my 7th birthday and read it over the years until the covers came off. It is full of every delightful children's poem you can imagine. When young, I read the nursery rhymes and ""The Moon is the North Wind's Cookie"" and ""The Duel"".When older, I delighted in ""The Village Smithy"" ""The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere"" and ""The Children's Hour"".To this day I can quote great swatches of it. The Joan Anglund drawings are charming and capture all the excitement and inspiration of this wonderful collection. If you at all think your children will like ""rhymes"" give this one a try."
3,School Uniform,We have to have these pants for our school uniforms. The pants fit weird. The waist is super small and the length super long and I have very tall children 5 Ft at 9yrs old. and the pants are at least 6 inches to long if I buy the correct waist measurement.
3,Great toy but doesn't last long,"My 11 month old loved this toy! When you press one of the animals, it first says the name of the animal. Press it again and it makes the animal sound. A third press and it plays a really cute song specific to each animal (example: ""I'm a gorilla/big, brown, and strong/I thump my hairy chest/while I sing this song"").But, the reason I gave it three stars is that it malfunctioned after only 2 1/2 months. It had nothing to do with the batteries. It's the wiring underneath the fabric where you press to hear the sounds. First, the monkey stopped working, then the lion. Now only 3 of 6 animals work. I have to hide it from my baby so she wouldn't cry out of frustration from it not working anymore!Otherwise, a great toy."
2,"Cute, but we're fed up with MONKEY!","Cute little songs and animal noises but the monkey seems to override every other animal. We push lion and hear ""I'm a monkey!,"" we push frog and hear, ""ooo-ooo-ah-ah!"" Occasionally the side we press comes up with correct name/noise/song but then after a bit that dang monkey interrupts again.We'll probably have a very confused baby if we keep this toy. Too bad as it's a cute toy."
5,Holy Crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!=),This is sooooooooooo cool! My brother has an ipod and he says that he would rather have a micro! I have used his ipod and it just doesnt compare to the micro.-----Pros-------easy to use touch screenFM tunerradio recordermicrophone for recording notes and stuffcan hold loads of musicSOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!-----Cons-------wellllllllllllll i cant think of any because this is sooooooooooooo sweet!!!!!!!
5,Excellen,"Talking about the product, I couldn't be more satisfied. Works very good, the color of the light is the way I expected and changes a lot the car and the visibility, for better, of course.Talking about the seller, excellent too. I had I urgency for the deliver and he anticipate for me, or make it came by the time I needed sure if I had to buy more stuff that he sells I would, and recommend."
2,Not recommended for enthusiasts,"What a cold, lifeless book. Full of interesting info, but with no enthusiasm for the art of the craft. This author might appeal to a technologist approaching weaving."
3,Faith-Based,It would be nice if the Amazon website made some reference to the fact that this book takes an approach that is fundamentally faith-based (religious).
5,Great for workouts,"This shirt is great for working out in, the material is very soft and breathable and it looks great as well!!"
4,a nice little radio,"Controls are well designed, sound quality is fine for a radio this small; a nice little radio for my desk (which is what I was looking for). My only complaint: raido reception isn't very good unless the headphones are plugged in (to serve as an FM antenna), undermining the nice-little-self-contained-package effect."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I was given this basket from a family member. They ordered this basket for the clotted cream--which was not sent with the basket---it was substituted. Also, the preserves was substituted. No reason was given and our email asking why was not answered by the company.So stay away from this company!"
2,Sony Lamp,Advertising as Sony lamp but instead it is a OSRAM after market product. Light bulb is not as sharp as the original.
1,MarginMart Sony Lamp Is a SCAM!,"The item shown on the web site is a Sony XL-2100U replacement lamp. The description even shows Sony as the Manufacturer. When the two lamps I purchased arived they are NOT Sony but some unidentified knock-offs. Based on other reviews of non-Sony lamps not working as well, and based on the fact that what was advertised and offered at point-of-sale on the Amazon web site was Sony product, I am trying to Return the non-Sony lamps and get a full refund. But the web site connection to MarginMart does not allow for a refund only a replacement. I have written to MarginMart (to only option provided - no phone number) and hope they see the error of their ways, but to everyone out there - BE AWARE that when they say Sony they may not mean it! What poor business practice - bait-and-switch at its worst!!"
1,Great Product,"Fits the application as promised,easy to install ,shipping was fast and arrived early, Tired of hese long surveysthis is the last one i am doing if you dont change the format"
1,False Advertising-Not A Sony Lamp,"The ad clearly stated this was a Sony lamp. Upon receipt it is the cheapest lamp sold, the Sylvania Osram. They clearly falsely advertised this product. Nowhere in the add did it state this was an Osram lamp, only that it was a Sony. Do not buy ""SONY"" XL2100 From River Valley Electronics as it is not a real Sony product, but rather a cheap generic lamp. The lamp did not come in a factory box, but rather a plain cardboard box. No invoice was included, nor was there any warranty documentation. BUYER BEWARE, go to a Sony Authorized Reseller and get the real thing. River Valley states that it is a Sony, but it is not! FALSE ADVERTISING! I cannot return it for a full refund because I have opened the box. there return policy states ""Unopened boxes can be returned for a 10% restocking fee"". How was I to learn that it was not a Sony lamp until I opened the box, now I cannot return. This is bait and switch of the worst kind. DO NOT buy from River Valley Electronics."
1,I have been cheated,"I bought this item from Amazon at a higher price than similar items offered on line, misguided by the description leading to mke believe it was a Sony legitimate part. It is not.It works, but it takes much longer to start than the original one.If you buy this one you can not return it once you open the box. I hope it lasts at least as long as the original one.My humble advise, buy the legitimate Sony for a few dollars more and be safe.If you can live with a lower performance unit, you can still buy this ""replacement"" for less in many places."
1,Not an Osram UHP but appears to be Halogen or Tungsten,"This is not an equivalent to the manufacturers XL2100. It contains a cheap, unsealed bulb that will last anywhere from 70-1000 hrs and NOT 4000-6000 hrs. I purchased it from Margin Mart and do not recommend them. You can tell because there are gaps on the side of the bulb and it is not a sealed unit like the original. The Agoraquest website (do a google search) has some good info."
2,Problems with this item,"As others have noted, this is NOT a Sony product.You might as well buy a bare bulb, since the lamp is not in a carrier.Putting the lamp in the carrier which you remove from your projection TV is 90% of the work.Other problems:no NEEDED hex wrench includedno directions of any kind(I have placed an image of the lamp in its carrier in the images for this item so that you know what to look for.)"
1,Blew after only 5 months!!!!,"We've had this TV since Sept. 2004. When the lamp blew in September of 2009 (seems pretty typical lifespan for such), we purchased a replacement from Amazon. As another reviewer stated, the item is misleading; we also received a Phillips bulb!Considering the price of the 1st replacement $158.00 and the prospect of a SONY replacement $199 from Sony, I feel kind of foolish not replacing the TV. However, since I don't have the money, we'll try another replacement, using a genuine Sony part.Check ALL vendor descriptions regardless of whichever website you use; it's a Sony housing with a Phillips bulb. You can only get a Sony/Sony part from Sony direct.[...]"
4,Quick turnaround,"I was happy that this item shipped quickly and was received quickly. The price was really good, although I think I would have been more confident if the lamp was the OEM one manufactured by Phillips as opposed to the Osram version, which for all I know is also considered OEM. The setup was a breeze. My TV works as good as ever. Assuming that this lamp lasts as long as the original (6.5 years), I will be happy with the savings."
2,Not happy,"I do not believe the quality is as good as the original product that came in our TV. Ever since this light was installed, our TV as had bright blue lights in the bottom corners of the screen."
2,Failed soon after installation,"I can't blame Amazon, but this lamp only worked for about 6 months after it was installed. Decided to buy a new flat-panel HDTV instead of getting another lamp. Gave the old TV away to my local American Legion Post and let them put a new lamp in it."
2,The reason for my discontent,"I think I ordered the wrong part. I thought I was ordering pt.# XL 2100 U. The part I recieved pt.# XL 210060 fits, but the TV is delayed from coming on, sometimes as much as 30 secs. The oridinal did not function thi way."
1,Sony XL210060 - Projection TV replacement lamp,"I purchased this projection lamp through Amazon from A&J; Forever. After a several months the picture started getting darker and darker when the TV was turned on. Now less than a year after purchase the picture has developed two blue lines toward the bottom of the picture. Not happy at all with this purchase! After contacting A&J; Forever I was told the lamp is out of warranty.Sincerely,Peter"
5,perfect buy,Saved my old TV with a simple fix service was great and received item before expected would do business with them again
1,This replacement lamp is lame.,"So i got this lamp and the moment it came in, things didn't seem right.1: the box had no label on it.2: had no hex tool3: came with no instructions papers4; fail within only 6 mouths and the front glass blew out!5 : Just don't be cheap and pay more and get a real one. It's better in the long run."
1,Beare of Discount DLP TV Lamps!!!,"I purchased, through Amazon, a Sony projection lamp from Discount DLP TV Lamps in May 2010. In April 2011, the lamp burned out under normal residential use. Publications suggest this lamp should last 5-8 years. Discount DLP TV Lamps refuses to respond to my inquiries. I can only conclude that they are in the business of regularly selling sub-standard - or perhaps even used - merchandise to unsuspecting on-line customers. I strongly caution any prospective buyer from being taken by this vendor and their predatory business practices."
2,replacement lamp for Sony XL-2100U,The lamp which was from Lamp Monsters was inferior due to the poor color of the TV. I returned it.
2,Lamp wont warm up,"This is not the OEM lamp as advertised, as mine was a Phillips. After the installation, it takes about 30 min for the TV to warm up. During that time it blanks out several times, then finally stays on. May be returning for another lamp"
1,Lamp blew up in my TV,"I purchased this lamp back in April 2010 after taking a chance upon reading the reviews on this lamp. Well, I was watching TV in early August 2010, my Sony rear projection TV shut off and I then heard a pop. The lamp light then came on. I removed the lamp and saw that it had actually blown up. Never again will I purchase a knock off lamp. Luckily my original lamp wasn't in too bad of shape and was able to reinstall it. BUYER BE AWARE and FOREWARNED!!!"
1,Garbage,"Bought the lamp on 7/7/11 and it died before 9/30/11. 6 month warranty? Nobody seems to know anything about a 6 month warranty. You will be referred to Sony Support if something happens to the lamp and they will let you know that their lamps come with a 90 day warranty and that they don't know anything about any ""OEM compatible"" lamp. Not Sony's fault, but mine for being an idiot and purchasing this product. Go to Sony's accessory store and buy the lamp for $200. Better to be robbed for a working part than robbed for a useless piece of junk. LESSON LEARNED - YOU REALLY GOT ME GOOD!"
1,Doesn't Last,"We bought this lamp in August of 2010, and the bulb burnt out in June of 2011. I don't want to have to buy a new lamp for my tv every year. This is not a Sony product."
1,Defective product that can't be returned,This was supposed to be a NEW Sony replacement lamp. What I got was a defective lamp which cannot be returned for credit or replacement because I waited longer than 90 days to install it in my TV after purchasing it from MarginMart. So basically I threw $104.80 down the drain. I should have gone direct to Sony and purchased it for $199. I tried to save money by getting one through this discount outlet and instead got something defective.
5,Awesome!! Hard to Find CD,I love this CD!! It was so hard to find this CD!!! I absolutely love it! I am a HUGE fan of this girl group and am so happy that I was able to find in from a seller who had it on CD. I still listen to this and am just as happy as the day I bought it!
5,Maxtor DiamondMax 10 300 GB is simply the fastest drive,"Just replaced my old HD (120 GB SATA DiamondMax 9) with this monster drive (300 GB) SATA Diamondmax 10 as my main OS drive. It is EXTREMELY fast; so fast that you can actually see the difference using Windows and bringing up applications. I never believed the hype but for the first time in my PC upgrade history, unlike the processor speeds nowaday, I actually see the vast improvement (85% faster) with this drive. Strongly recommend to use this drive as your main OS drive for the incredible speed. Who would have thought the HD speed can make this much improvement? I am just speechless about this drive. Go Maxtor."
2,Failed Basic Drive Test within 1 year of use,"MAXTOR 6L300S0 300GB Seagate diag. software showed that basic drive test FAILED even though data ""Seemed OK"". JPEG Pictures were a little degraded but no other Windows complaints.Have had both Seagate and MAXTOR drives fail catastrophically and at the worst times. Actuator failures are common.Why do drives die so often and so soon?Backup, backup, backup or else.Don't know what is a truly reliable drive maker!Really looking for better drive quality than cheap.Always BACKUP BACKUP EVERY DAY. You never know. A 500gb drive and ext enclosure are less than $150.Failed Basic Drive Test within 1 year of use"
2,Disappointed Customer,I originally purchased two of these drives and installed them in an Intel matrix raid array (raid 0 and raid 1)on a new home built system. After one of the drives went bad I replaced it and installed it using a raid 1 (mirror) arrangement. The new drive has gone bad and I'm replacing it with a third and final drive. The only good thing I can say is that the price has come down since the first purchase and one of the original drives is still working. I would not recommend this manufacturer for what I consider to be inferior workmanship in this particular product line.
5,Escellent HD,"I bought this hhd 4yrs ago and is still runing only as a back up to my 120 ssd, however in time to time the hdd make some strange noises i think maybe is reaching his final days."
1,great when its working!,i had 2 of this hard drives !! i buyed them last feb2005 !! i didnt need them right away so i left them in the foil and but them in the pc just before x-mas 2005 i have but backup on them and some new stuff!!! everything was great until april 2006 my bios didnt see the HD anymore and the HD are not spinning anymore!!! i called maxtor to ask if the can help me!! the answer was sorry 1 year waranty is over!!! have a great day !!! NEVER EVER ANYTHING FROM MAXTOR IN MY PC!
5,Nice!,"This little pot makes a great cup of coffee! This won't replace my regular coffee maker (I drink a lot of coffee), but when I'm in the mood for an especially good cup I will be using this."
5,"Best cup of joe, ever!","First of all, I ordered the Bialetti on Saturday. I received it today (Monday), props to Amazon. The Moka maker itself rocks. It is super easy to use, takes only about 10 minutes, and brews an amazing cup of coffee. My hat is off to the Italians!"
4,Warning! This type of expresso maker can explode!,"I am writing this note as a warning for users of this type of espresso maker. A couple of days ago, I was making my expresso coffee as I have been doing for the last 20 some years. All of a sudden an explosion with the equivalent decibels of a 38 caliber revolver shot, took place. Luckily I had just turned my face to tell something to my wife. When I finally realized what had happened my expresso maker was in several pieces. The coffe grounds holder tore a hole in the ceiling's sheet rock. The bottom came completely off. Luckily, I was unharmed. Please be aware. I do not have any explanation for what happened other than this particular maker was about five years old. Maybe it was metal fatigue. I hope these comments will avoid uneccessary injuries."
3,Something to consider,"I love this espresso maker, just love it! It makes great coffee, I agree with all the rave reviews.I have one word for you to think about: ""aluminum"".After couple of times I used it, I noticed that aluminum on the bottom of the inside started peeling/oxidizing/dissolving. At first, it did not bother me, I knew the problem and I cleaned the parts before using with a washcloth taking off the aluminum powder (when it dries up it looks like a powder). Not long ago I read an article that advised not using aluminum pans and pots in cooking, since aluminum gets absorbed by the body and this is tied to an Alzheimer disease.Recently, I bought stainless steel espresso maker. Makes same great coffee, however it does not have a spout (it is just round) which makes it hard to pour into small coffee cups and the upper part (the part where the coffee goes) has sort of trench on the bottom which makes it inconvenient in cleaning.Hope this helps."
1,Disappointed,This seems like it would be a nice heavy duty coffee maker but the product was shipped defective. The filter jammed into the water resevior and was not removable. We had to return it.
3,Great tasting coffee - with issues,"The espresso it makes is really great tasting. I am used to south indian filter coffee, which is basically boiled milk foamed with strong espresso (often a good percentage of chicory gives it a distinctive flavor). This unit can recreate provide a strong and fragrant espresso in 7 minutes (as the milk comes to boil!). Good mornings begin with great coffee!I would give it 3.5 stars - the penalty is for how easily its insides got discolored. No care instructions to prevent this - I have used vineagar every once in a while to successfully to remove most of the discoloration."
5,Vavoom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What's not to like? Frothy espresso in the time it takes for water to boil! No espresso machine taste! Straight off the gas grill! Copious amount of energy! I'm cleaning everything I own... all before 5 am!!!! Of course it helps to know the right coffee to use, and how to prepare it for roasting, grinding, or whatever floats your boat! Clean it with water only and it will last for a long time! Ciao!"
5,"Excellent, voluminous espresso maker",Just what the barrista ordered.....for camping. Have to have my cappuccinos in the morning so bought this and it was exactly what we needed. Bialetti makes great stove top espresso makers.
4,I just love it,I have one of these for about 4 - 5 years. It works great and very fast so be careful when using it. The only draw back is the limitation of the amount of cups. I ended up buying a second incase something was to happen to my first one.
2,Better on electric stove,The first few weeks were great until I moved to an apt with gas stove. I ended up melting the gasket and the handle. It is now permanently unusable and my entire house ended up with melting rubber aroma. mmm goo~d. Not.
2,inferior quality!,"I needed a replacement for my Ikea espresso stovetop and chose this one because of the excellent reviews. Well on its second use, there was this awful smell and the handle simply melted away into a drippy Daliesque sculpture. I'd set the flame to medium-high. There were no warnings anywhere that the flame should be set to low! I've owned other espresso stovetops before and have never had this happen. I think the plastic handle is of really inferior quality and there just isn't enough distance between the bottom of the pot and the handle. Luckily I got it from Amazon and could send it right back. The Ikea espresso stovetop was fantastic... very stylish too except I don't think they make it anymore."
2,poor quality,"I have had Bialetti coffe makers before so I have a type for comparison. This machine is not the high quality that I have had before. The metal seems unfunished, as if it was diseased.I'm going to look for another."
2,Bialetti Moka Express 6 cup,I do not believe that this product is for a 6 cup express coffee this item is just to small. I am not pleased that I purchased this item however I will keep it to make a small amount of express coffee. Just not worth the price it costs.Bialetti Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Percolator
5,GRRRRRRRREAT Coffee!!,"I've been using a French press for several years since my Spidem super-auto espresso machine bit the dust. Although I missed the taste of strong, sweet, black espresso that came from the Spidem, I didn't want to spend $600+ dollars for a new machine. So i finally decided to try the Moka Express and, after a few experimental brews, it is now giving me that great espresso flavor I've been missing, and for less than $30. My mornings just got better."
4,Great Expresso maker,"There are some who have written that this is not a proper expresso coffee maker. Well it sure taste like it.Makes a wicked thick batch of coffee, and I like it.Very sturdy design, and my only complaint is that it is TOO SMALL.Have fun."
4,I love it. My girlfriend thinks the coffee tastes metalic.,"I love this type of coffee maker.Coffee is stronger than standard french press and drip coffees. But weaker than a ""normal"" U.S. style espresso maker. Just perfect for me.Unsure if she is imagining it or not, but my girlfriend she thinks the coffee tastes metallic. I don't taste..."
5,Perfectly functional,"I bought this pot for use for vacations since espresso is pretty problematic and expensive when you have to buy it regularly. The pot works well, fill water to the line, put in a Moka ground coffee (a little finer then normal espresso) put it on the burner on med heat and 6-9 minutes later you have 4-5 shots in the top. Its not as good as what I can pull with my prosumer machine at home, but its certainly serviceable espresso when you are traveling and pretty darn good for a $25 pot if you don't want to invest in a machine"
4,Still figuring out how to make the perfect espresso,"The first shipment I received was open and previously used, so I sent that back. I also tried the 3 cup version, but that just wasn't big enough for me, since some water always stayed in the base.The very first try I made with the 3 cup tasted perfect, but it also took around 20+ minutes to make, since I have coil stovetop and put the moka pot on low with cold filtered water.Now I use near-boiling water to speed up the process on a higher heat setting, takes around 10 minutes. I just can't seem to get it as perfect as that first time though, or how I had it back in Italy.I'm using Lavazza crema e gusto, but I feel that I soon will make the perfect pot again, just takes practice. I take the pot off as soon as the coffee comes up. Is it standard for some water to leak back down to the base though?Either way, I'm enjoying my espresso in the morning, whether its bitter or not."
4,Please Help Me!!!,"First off, I have owned this particular Moka pot for about four years and I love it. But, and this a big ""but"", when you eventually have to replace the rubber gasket/seal ring - HOW DO YOU GET IT TO WORK PROPERLY AGAIN IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME? My friend has had to replace the rubber gasket twice and told me that it took forever (literally more than a month of daily use) for it to begin working properly again, and I have to admit that I was skeptical - well I'm not anymore as I recently replaced mine and am going through withdrawals as I wrestle and cajole a few precious drops out of it every morning. And I know it makes no logical sense for it not to work properly immediately, but it DOESN'T. Anyone with some insight into this would make me a very happy man if you knew a secret to solving this problem - Thanks!"
3,"Good, but a hassle","It makes some of the best coffee I've ever had, BUT I have to stand right next to it when I'm using it. It goes from dead quiet to instant boil with the top compartment immediately fills up and if you're not right next to it to take it off the heat and open the lid, you're in for a surprise. The top blew open on ours and sprayed coffee grounds everywhere in the kitchen, and I do mean everywhere. I'm still finding coffee grounds. The best plan is to put it on a medium heat, which takes longer, and be ready to grab it the moment it starts to boil."
5,Bialetti Moka Express brings back fond memories of Italy!,"After a two week trip to Italy our return home seemed imcomplete without a Bialetti Moka Express. Thankfully, our Amazon order filled the bill. It's easy to operate and I use it almost daily. The aroma of Illy coffee fills our home with memories of Tuscany."
2,"6 shot, not cup.","I wanted a small coffee pot for my camper and thought I would try this one. It is advertised as 6 cups, but it is not. More like 6 espresso shots."
4,I would have given this 5 stars..................,"I love this product and it makes perfect strong coffee with many different types of ground coffee. The finish on the outside that is near the ""little italian man"" symbol looks smudged and looks like the 2inch area where an oily substance got on it and then the aluminum was coated in a shiny finish throughout the whole thing.A+ coffee making qualityA+ design and parts are excellentC- for the outside aluminum smudges because it looks used even though it is brand-new from the factory.OVERALL= B-I would suggest to pay 40$ and buy the bialetti moka crem over this product because of the polished aluminum finish and higher quality metal of the moka crem pot.I am the owner of the bialetti moka crem and this bialetti 6800 pot(6cup).enjoy"
2,Where is the true espresso experience and taste?,"I love robust coffee and wanted to have a true Italian espresso maker and its corresponding taste experience. What a huge disappointment. The coffee is easy to brew, but the taste is anything that one would expect in an espresso. The recommended amount of coffee (and I used the Italian Espresso) is either too little or simply lacking in robustness. I would not recommend this coffee maker or it's corresponding coffee."
3,This is a little harder than it should be,"I expected an old-school coffeemaker, which would be easy to operate. It was, except that the very basic instructions were focused on how to put the thing together and where to put the coffee, which I'm sure I could have figured out on my own. There was no mention of how much coffee to use, how much water, how much heat, how long to cook. So the first few pots I made tasted terrible. I finally had to write to the manufacturer.More importantly, this pot makes a brew that's somewhat different than I'm used to. I was expecting the caramel brown, slightly frothy espresso, but instead, we're getting what looks a lot like black coffee. It tastes good, but not great. But maybe I'm still using it wrong..."
1,Coffee remains inside pot,"This is the second time that I returned the Moka express from Amazon. Both times I received that pot and found black dusts inside the pot. There're also scratches on the outside. I highly suspect that the pot has been used and returned to Amazon, and they never check it. I wonder if anyone else have the same experience.My friend has the same product and I'm convinced that this is a great coffee maker. However, Amazon is preventing me from getting what I paid for!"
4,sticky gel and awful smell!,"Mine had some kind of sticky gel on the gasket. And the rubber smells awful! I've never had an espresso maker before. Is it normal? Does it go away? I tried washing it with soap but it didn't help, i still feel that sticky gel and the smell didn't go away either even after boiling some water. I'll probably return it and get something nicer.I'm surprised nobody wrote anything about it. Maybe it's just my espresso maker?UPDATEAfter 5 washes the smell and that sticky substance were gone and i can finally enjoy my coffee with no worries!"
3,Inexpensive Espresso Maker,"For the money, this makes good espresso. I have a gas range and it takes about 15 minutes. I like the size and style of this espresso maker. It does not take up much space. I do not like that it is not electric. I set a timer but worry that the espresso will burn. It is not very difficult to clean once you get used to all the pieces. I do not like that I have to worry about water sitting in the product for too long and causing rust. Overall, I am happy to have this for making an occasional cup of espresso."
4,Among the best we've tried,"Having had these in the past, this measures up well so far. We've previously had to throw out old espresso makers when the screw-on tread has threaded, or when the bottom has worn - so this works well as a replacement. Easy to use and clean."
5,awesome!!!,"love it! nothing like a good cup of coffee to start the day!! this is an easy to make, inexpensive way of making espresso!"
5,Amazing.,"Don't know why I didn't find this sooner! Spent a long time looking for the right espresso maker, read reviews of tons of 300$ and up machines, but this little guy gets it done! Paired with an aero latte frother, we make fantastic lattes!Aerolatte To Go, Milk Frother, Black"
4,Forget the electric espresso maker...,"I purchased this after my electric espresso machine (a Breville Ikon just barely out of warranty) came to a slow, seizing death and I didn't have the few hundred dollars to fork out for a new one. The 6-CUP BIALETTI MOKA EXPRESS STOVETOP ESPRESSO MAKER makes a full coffee cup of espresso (6 shots), gets me up and going, and even gives me a great massage before I leave the house. It's pretty easy to clean out, and takes about the same amount of time my old electric maker did to pull me an entire cup. And I'd arguably say the end product coming out of the Bialetti is better. So stop wasting your time and mine browsing around and buy one already. Or go for the higher capacity one!"
4,Does the job!,"Great way to make coffee...you really can't make better espresso much better than this. Only problem is if you are use to larger cups...these 6 cups are really referring to ""shots"" of espresso...so ""6"" cups = about one and a half mugs of coffee!"
1,cheap quality,"the plastic bag was ripped open and one of the (2) rubber gaskets that should come with the box, it MISSING!"
3,not exactly the same item as I saw it on the web it was listed,"The picture of this item it was listed has notes inside the maker, when I receive the product, there is no notes inside. I am not sure if it's missing somewhere else, or I've gotten a wrong shipment."
1,Beware of this vendor - I did not receive a Bialetti.,"I have a smaller Bialetti and I wanted to upgrade to a larger 6-cup model, so I bought the 6800 through Amazon and sold by East Coast Traders (aka Tumble Trade Inc.)Package arrived on time but oh surprise!! What was inside the box was not a Bialetti as sold on amazon.com but a no-brand, probably Chinese product, crudely made and with a home-made looking instruction sheet; all of this inside a plastic bag just thrown into the shipping box. Needless to say I have just returned the item.I am a regular customer of amazon.com and this is the first time something like this happens to me. It really makes me angry when you buy a specific item from a specific brand and what you receive is just a cheap version of what you were told you were buying. I don't know if it was just an error or a true scam but beware if you are buying from this vendor."
1,Bialetti knockoff,"I ordered what was described as the Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-cup stovetop espresso maker. What showed up was a extremely cheap knockoff made in Tiawan (Said so on the box). The material is weak and the handle is starting to break off after three uses. The real Bialetti is made in Italy and my last one lasted for years, this one is ready for the garbage."
5,Awesome product,I have had this product now for over an year and am amazingly satisfied with it. I use it to make Indian coffee and trust me Madras Coffee tastes like heaven. It is my best friend and I love the product to death.
4,Inexpensive But Good,It performs as promised. Using it as directed seems to yield slightly weak espresso. I have experimented a bit and now use less water which helps a lot. The price/performance ratio is is outstanding.
4,Its good.,I enjoy changing up my coffee brews. I have about 4 different kinds of coffeemachines to fool around with. This one is not my favorite however.
4,Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker,"First, I have to say, this is my first Moka Maker (I've only started drinking coffee recently). My plan was to get a traditional Moka Pot and good finely ground coffee appropriate for this machine. Bialetti is a traditional Italian company and I decided to get the aluminium pot (although some people recommended stainless steel pots).Although this is the big Moka Maker (6-cup), the cup is the Italian measure and even if you make it full, the amount of coffee is worth of 2-3 people. The positive site is the simple manipulation, prepare and cleaning of the device. However, I am little disappointed with the fact that the coffee I bought (Italian coffee specifically made for Moka pots) drops through the filter and gets to the lower container (which should not happen). It's either because of the coffee grind or the holes in the filter are too big. I will try coffee with coarser grind (not the espresso grind)."
5,So simple. So delicious.,"I have the Tassimo Machine, which I love, but occasionally I run out of T-Discs and wanted a back-up. I bought this because of the great reviews and they were all correct. I followed the directions of one of the most thorough reviewers and created the most delicious double shot of espresso! I set the heat on low and set the timer for 10 minutes. Perfection. I love the ease of my Tassimo, but there is something really fulfilling about making espresso this way. And it was so rich especially with a splash of heavy cream. I used Gevalia Espresso Roast. So excited that I can take this camping too!"
4,Expresso pot Evaluation,"The expresso pot is easy to use and fairly safe.The screw thread that connect the bottom with the top work fine although not as finely finished as I've seen on others.Parts are easy to clean and reassemble. All in all, a good product for the price..."
4,Simple and effective,"I looked very hard for a replacement for my little Kruppsexpresso before I gave up, because similar electric machinesall had serious quality issues. Back to basics--I'm convincedthat Bialeti got it right in the 1930's. Still made in Italy.Very drinkable coffee. I don't think it can be beat foranything under $250."
5,easy-pleasy Italian coffee,"This li'l jasper makes some great coffee and it's so easy, too. And fun. It's also fun to read the English instructions, trans. from Italian: ""suitable for the food use and right for the gas cooker, the electic [sic] plate and the pyroceram."" And Don't put too much water in the ""little tank""!!! This coffee maker also has the ""Little Man"" emblazoned on it to ""guarantee of the genuine article."" I was worried...(The ""Little Man"" resembles the old Pizza Hut character from the 60's, and in French is called ""Pere Moustache!"") I'm glad they spent their time and resources building a good product and not on stupid marketing efforts."
4,"it's not espresso, but it'll make very good strong coffee","simple, straight forward to use. very easy to clean. and durable. can't beat it for the price. better than any drip."
2,Sloppy casting job,"While I'm not a big fan of Italian products in general, this particular Bialetti marks a new low in quality control. The casting/finish on the base unit threads was so bad that I was forced to scavenge an old base to get the unit to operate properly. But I've learned a valuable lesson: any future Bialetti products I buy will be locally, so I can easily return them, if defective."
2,not as good as the smaller one,"I have been using the smaller Bialetti Express maker for decades. It is excellent. However, this one, no matter what I do, never ever brings up all the water. I understand that everyone in Italy knows this and uses the small one over and over. Too bad."
5,Great coffee,"This item is very simple to use, and makes fantastic espresso. Use that espresso for a great home made Americano!"
3,Okay,"It's okay, takes time to clean. Like it to make it in advance for next day at work. Not really an espresso maker, it's more of a coffee maker better than the machine or so. Sorry for the Starbucks haters but Starbucks Espresso grounds works better than any coffee I have ever used. Tried the Lavazza and not even close than Starbucks."
2,Big Disappointment,"Too much pop , too little R&B, spells disaster for El's solo debut in 1986. However, some songs save the project from being a total lost: ""SOMEONE"", ""LOVE ALWAYS"" and ""LOST WITHOUT HER LOVE"". His second CD, ""Gemini"" is much much better."
3,Good product,The size of the chalk/magnetic board and flannel board are great. The only issue I have had is that the book holder has fallen off the magnet board. The magnet does not stay on. I have reglued the magnet to the block of wood using a glue gun and it has still fallen off.
1,Wish I Could Use It - Incomplete Delivery,"I can't really rate the saw, but I can rate Amazon's service. I purchased the saw well over a month ago, but Amazon only shipped me the saw and half of the fence. I received a fence, but no guide rails to mount it on.It is impossible, it seems, to contact Amazon for assistance (try to find a phone number, or a contact for complaining about an order).I'll never buy tools from Amazon again."
4,Solid performer at a fair price,"The saw has all the makings if precision cutting system - heavy duty construction, strong motor, precise arbor, and solid fence. The stock blade is average so the saw benefits from a high quality blade. It's very well built and should last a lifetime. It'll also accept many stock aftermarket jigs and accessories. A good miter gauge or crosscut sled is a must, as are zero clearance inserts. Dust collection needs the same help as most contractor saws. I much prefer the steel T2 fence to many of the cheaper aluminum fences on the competitors. The solid cast wings are a great ""nice to have"" feature too.What's not to like?"
4,Stolen by the Sea,The begging was a little boring but it got to some good entertainment and sadness but all in all it was good
5,Recommended for aspiring spiritual seekers!,"It is a mistake to think that this book deals with lofty spiritual ideals. ""How you can talk with God"" is in fact a highly practical book. All those souls who doubt that it is possible to talk with God should read this book and apply the basic principles contained here.Throughout history, there were many souls who revealed that it is possible to have a conversation with God. Recent examples are Yogananda, Neale Donald Walsh and other saints in India. An atheist may view this book with scorn but if one follows the teachings here, the so-called atheist would be having a daily conversation with God! God is indeed the most approachable and understanding being in the cosmos and by studying the life of the author, one will find that Yogananda was ALWAYS in conversation with the ""Soul of souls"". In short, this book is recommended to ALL spiritual seekers of ALL faiths."
5,Great Daily Companion,"This wonderful book is a great companion to my daily before bedtime routine. The more you read this book the more you get out of it. I sometimes just open the book to a page and get a reading so in line to where I am on my spiritual path. You do not have to be religious or on a spiritual path to read this book. However, this book is highly recommended for those who are seeking a spiritual path to God."
5,Inspirational,"The Dolls of Lisbon is an amazing film. Smart, creative, and funny this assemblage of artists is an inspirational group of men and women who are dedicated to art in its rawest form of self expression. Ethan is a talented writer and film maker. The impressive music sound track is an added bonus. Well done. Looking forward to more productions..."
4,Making art while making due,"I enjoyed this film. It gave me an interesting glimpse into the processes of creation and exhibition, and was also pretty inspiring.The common theme that I got throughout was one of reverent creation. Regardless of hardship and difficulty, the artists would create, independent from monetary gain.Throughout the movie, I was impressed by the film technique. There was clearly quite a lot of effort put into the film, and it shows.I recommend this movie to people interested in art, exploring culture, and being just a little different from everyone else."
3,Dolls of Lisbon,Another Antagonist Art Movement film here. This film was pretty good. You see artists collaborating across the globe all because of these hand crafted dolls and coming together for one show. I wish the would have taken a lot of the filler stuff out and focused on these dolls more!
5,"Awesome, awesome, awesome",I really enjoyed this film - It was really inspiring to see the crew go out and do some workshops and see a whole slew of new artists. This is my favorite Antagonist film yet!
3,fun story for my 2nd graders,"Great book! Fun to read during my Fairy Tale unit with my 2nd grade students. it was a twist on the traditional fairy tale, the princess and the pea. It was good to tie in a lesson on point of view with my students as well. The only downside to this book was that it had a pretty bad smell to it when it arrived. I removed the book jacket and that helped some, but my students did not want to hold it or be near it until the smell started to go away."
2,Disappointed,This book has the possibility to be a great read for children who like turn about fairy tales. Lots of chances to enlarge on humor but it had more pic's than substance. Hoping it would be as funny a read like the Nick Page story books. Story line is too predictable.savanna
2,For the most delicate of wrists,"Pretty watch, good price, but what happened to the band? It is so short, only those with single digit sizing should consider."
1,Part fell off/Poor customer service,"The metal ring around the crystal of the watch fell off within 2 years after normal use. I called bulova customer service and they told me that they do not sell that part individually and I would either need to buy a $200 part or I would need to send it in. They said that if I sent it in, they would try to fix it, but the cost would be anywhere from $60-$200. This is a simple metal ring that fell off and does not contain any stones or anything. It should cost them about $5 to make. The big problem is that the crystal is more vulnerable to cracking without this metal piece, which is what happened to mine. I would be careful when considering this watch."
5,thanks to Braun!,I had used a Braun Silk-epil before; and I was so satisfied with it that I decided to buy the same product the same brand for a second time after having my old one for more than four years. definitely try it if you have never done before! a cost much less than that of wax and a skin much softer than shaved!
3,Long time user,"I have had this epilator for about 10 months now. It works as its supposed to, doesn't get clogged up or lose power. My issue is with the efficiency. I have noticed that it often breaks small hairs as opposed to pulling them out. So it defeats the whole purpose of using this tool. If the hair is long enough, its easier to wax and if its too short, well, I just live with it. I bought the product for in-between waxes, when there is medium growth but I cannot wait until the next wax session.I assume this product works for ladies with finer or less hair. I have moderate to thick hair on my legs, which starts growing back within a week of waxing. Just my bad luck, I guess... :("
5,I like it too much,It's more than I expected. Dosn't weight too much. At the first time hurt a little but before I used to it.
3,"Can't call anything by Smokey bad, but he's starting to run out of fresh ideas here","30 years after the beginning of his days with the Miracles, Smokey Robinson was still headlong into a recording career, and while his longevity can be as justified as that of any other long lasting artist, this album doesn't exactly serve to floor you like some of his other albums will. ""Don't Wanna Be Just Physical"" is at least catchy, if not recognizably Smokey, but that's about the best thing I can say about this album."
4,Small and useful,"After using the swiss knife for years, I realize that the tools I use most often are the scissors, knife, and screwdriver. Forceps and pen have been used occasionally' This kit happens to have all the tools I need and no excrescent. I expected it to be even thinner though."
5,Great multipurpose pocket knife!!,This knife is a replacement for the one my dad gave me. Victorinox makes a great pocket tool for a lot of simple uses!!
4,Ennio and Siouxsie,A creepy cool cd of reverb drenched desert songs for Thelma carrying on without Louise. Spaghetti Western suburban delight.
4,Thanks,"Thanks for sending exactly what I ordered and in a timely manner, as requested. Learning Access is not an easy task but with this book it has been easier to understand. Keep up the good work."
3,A brave attempt,"Keep in mind: I absolutely hate MS Access for being non-intuitive, dense, and frustrating for anyone but a programmer. Given that, the authors make a brave attempt to explain Access and their book has been enormously helpful to me. Still, certain basic concepts never quite get explicated as a 'dummy' would like. I still don't know how to put a picture on a form or to get fields to fill in 'automagically.' The book tells me it can be done, but it stops shorting of showing me exactly how. Getting precise instructions from this book is often like getting directions from a Vermont farmer who assumes that you know ""where the old church used to be"" or ""where Joe's brother got struck by lightning."" It often points me in the right direction without quite getting me where I want to go."
4,Philips AE2180 Splash Resistant Stereo Cassette Radio,"The colour is really cool and really suits any fun loving personality. The ability to use it in the rain is really beneficial especially if your favourite song is playing. The 2.5"" speaker delivers relatively decent sound, although I would hardly call it dynamic. The strap is also good because you don't need an extra bag although I personally prefer a belt clip (this is the only reason that this Philips did not get 5 stars."
1,Unfortunate purchase. Worst radio I have ever owned.,"The signal rejection is horrible. That is to say, I set it to my favorite NPR station and another station 11.5MHz higher booms over it. I did this experiment right next to my Sangean clock radio, and I also tried the (Great) GE 7-2887 Portable radio. The non-Philips units worked perfectly, so it wasn't some anomaly wth the ionosphere (unfortunately, they aren't water proof, and make no claims to be). So I opened the back up (where the battery compartment is) to have a look around. Although the batteries themselves were dry (there is separate seal for them) the screws that hold the radio together were rusted. I bought this unit in November and it's rusting--this in a product built for use in the shower... So, buy it if you want to hear multiple stations at once, and don't get it near water."
1,bad,i think this radio is verry ugly and the quality of the sound is not as good as i thought it would be. Thats why i rated this 1 star.
5,Second hand book in excellent condition!,I ordered this book for a colleague who wanted to read it. I can't say anything about the content but the book was in excellent condition and the shipping was much faster than anticipated. Overall extremely happy with this transaction - thank you!
5,One of the best of an essential series,"It's amazing how much stuff is compared to Lewis, Tolkien, and L'Engle. In this case, though, the comparisons really are valid. The best of children's literature discusses good vs evil in terms too direct for the jaded taste and easy embarassment of most adults; fantasy especially lends itself to cosmic issues.The Dark is Rising certainly ranks among those best books, and this may be the best in the series (with still competition from The Grey King and Silver on the Tree). Some idea of the impact of this series may be conveyed by the fact that I can still recite, from memory, all the poem/prophecies in the series."
5,Magical and Life changing!!,"These books were so amazing. The plot is wonderfully laid out, and after you read it, it makes you want to be a part of the ancient struggle between good and evil in the world. When I came to the end of the series, I felt like I wanted to cry because I had come to love all the characters. I just couldn't believe they had to go away. If any, these are the books I will read to my children and they to theirs because I want to keep this story alive, for, as they say in the story, forever and ever. The Dark is Rising by Susan Copper will capture your soul and never, ever fade from your memory. Ever."
2,DaRk Is RiSinG~ KCS,"When Will Stanton turns 11, he experiences a birthday different than most and learns that he is the last of the old ones. The old ones were put on earth to protect the world from being over taken by an evil power, the Dark. He has to find six signs that will be of key importance in the battle between Dark and Light. Will the Dark take over the world? or will he be able to prevent it?I didn't really care for this book because I lost interest in certain parts. I would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy books and although I got bored the writers craft is pretty good."
3,"Decent children's literature, not much else","Good for kids and young teens, this book will be largely unsatisfying to anyone older, because of the simplistic nature of the conflict (Light vs Dark, doesnt get much simpler than that, the simplistic structure of the problem (gather six signs) and the lack of very original stuff throughout the book.The book has quite a well-written atmosphere of dread, and at times the plot pacing and events (involving multiple times and futures) can be quite complex, but on the whole this is good, solid children's literature without too much that really captivates. As a result it deserves a 3 star rating, which is not bad, as I like to use the whole spectrum of stars when giving ratings."
3,beautiful prose can't save a weak story,"Will Stanton discovers that he is an Old One on his birthday, and thus begins an adventure against the rising darkness in the twelve days of Christmas. Beautiful wintry imagery (of the darkness of the solstice and the coldness of the winter) blended with enchanting Celtic mythology, the book is wonderfully written. Unfortunately, though, a lack of strong characters and plot fail to get the tale off the ground or to enchant or engage the reader. It's mostly wandering around in time and blizzards looking for signs. Mediocre and frankly dull. Grade: B-"
5,Not just for kids,"What a fantastic fantasy! Long before Harry Potter was even born! Although The Dark is Rising is rated as a book for kids, and the main character is only 11 years old, the quality of writing, plotting, characterization, not to mention the well-researched folklore, make this book a treat for readers of any age.Enthusiastically looking forward to the next in this highly enjoyable series."
4,A modern British fairy tale,This is the 2nd of a 5 part series of books based on British mythology but set in modern times. American readers will find many odd and archaic words which may prove difficult for children. Otherwise a great adventure read.
3,Worth a listen for Alex Jennings alone,"I guess it was listening to the voice of Will Stanton's sister that did it. As I was driving, listening to the tape, I was delighted by the quality of the actress's voice - and then remembered that Alex Jennings had recorded it! The spectrum of vocal styles he creates on these tapes is simply spectacular. It is truly worth the purchase price just to hear his narration.Cooper has created an engaging world in this book, but to tell the truth, there are too many logical flaws to make it a fulfilling one. Will Stanton has a quest, but it is not at all clear why he alone can fulfill it - especially with Merriman at his side for most of the pivotal events. And why does Will get his education as an Old One only after some potentially dangerous events have occurred? And so on.But Jennings delivery makes the tape an essential purchase."
4,The Dark Is Rising...,"The main book of The Dark Is Rising sequence is The Dark Is Rising by Susan Cooper. Why is everyone... and everything afraid of Will Stanton? This leads him to a revelation, he is one of The Old Ones. He has got to stop the Dark from rising! Can he do it? Before that, he needs to obtain all the circles of the Old Ones! Will he succeed? Read the book to find out! If you like this book, you can try other books in the sequence: Over Sea Under Stone, Greenwitch, The Grey King and many others."
5,OK---One of my faves!,"On the eve of his eleventh birthday, Will Stanton's world began to change, drawing him into a legacy that would change his life--and the story of the long conflict between the Light and Dark for the fate of the world.For he was the last of the Old Ones, quasi-immortals born to keep the world from domination from the Lords of the Dark. And in his time of learning, from the strangeness of his birthday eve to the worst danger on MidWinter's eve, he set in motion a quest for the six great Signs of the Light that alone could save the world from domination by the last and greatest rising of the Dark.I adore this series, and this is one of the best written books in it. I'm fascinated by Will's double nature and enjoy characters like Merriman, Hawkins. And I'll never listen to Greensleeves again without thinking a little of the chimes of doors of time, or the hint of Paul playing a very old flute.Marvelous.This is a sequel to Over Sea, Under Stone."
2,Can You Say Deus Ex Machina?,"Having learned in the beginning of the book that Will can't be killed or even harmed, I never felt he or anyone else was in much peril. Most of the Signs seemed to fall into his lap rather easily, his obstacles(such as they were) were largely overcome with help from external forces, and his mistakes never cost him much. The first third of the book was short on action and long on exposition. And there were a couple of glaring plot inconsistencies. Okay, the descriptive writing was quite good and the dialogue was believable. But this isn't even close to being great children's literature."
1,"I wanted to like it, but...","This book was a complete let-down after the first of the series. Everything about it seemed completely over-the-top, starting with the one character repeated booming out `THE DARK... THE DARK IS RISING!' It went downhill from there. Every possible fantasy cliché was realized (including `mystical' sounding rhymes and poems), the characters were a bit insipid and uninspiring, and the plot seemed thin. I found myself not caring in the slightest how it ended, and once it did, felt no compulsion to read any further in the series.There are far better children's fantasy series out there, including A Wrinkle in Time and its sequels, The Spiderwick Chronicles, A Series of Unfortunate Events, and, yes, the Harry Potter series."
2,Hmm. . .,"I'm not sure why this book seemed so bad to me. With a few books I have felt that I was missing something the author had hidden, but I could not feel that this book even contained anything to be missed! I've never had such a hard time with a book, and I generally can read the most mature literature. I like Cooper's writing style, but of all the books in her series, this is my least favorite. The order of events and the mystical things that happen leave the reader waiting for them to make sense, but they never do! Perhaps this book will work for me someday, but I much preferred the prequel, Over Sea Under Stone. Too bad it couldn't help make Dark is Rising make better sense."
3,DIR Review,"Dark is Rising is a fantasy book about a kid named Will Stanton who learns that he is the last of The Old Ones, a group of immortal people. Through the Winter in England, Will is taught by The Old Ones, who fight the forces of evil.The characters in this book are interesting and well-developed. I related to Will personality-wise when I was younger. The plot was very detailed and well-written. There were many mystical, fantasy elements to the story, leading to a very magical plot sequence.I'm not completely sure where i stand on the book's quality, as I had to rush through reading it, but I would recommend it to fantasy novel enthusiasts."
2,pretty bad,U may thik this book is good from the good reviews above...but the truth is..is that the book is pretty confusing to follow...and i found my self lots of times wishing i was reading a different book...but there was a few parts that held my interest....
2,"good story, poor writing","The story in this book is pretty good and interesting, but the characters annoy me. Maybe I was expecting them to be as good as Harry Potter, where, unlike this book, the main character can solve his own problems and is courageous. I know this book was written before Harry Potter, but JK Rowling had Harry Potter in her head long before. her story is more interesting and has more subplots and a unique style of writing. this book is sort of unique, but I have read ones quite like it. If you want a good book, read the Harry Potter series. Oh, contrary to other comments, Harry does not just revolve around quiddich, in the last book, he doesn't even play it."
1,I thought this was terrible!,"This was certainly not my cup of tea, and was extremely difficult to get the jist of. Worded awkwardly, I didn't quite understand it, and lost the plot many times throughout. This was not because the book is too old for me but because I don't think the book is written very well that it explained things enough. Many of the reviews rate this book highly but I found it boring and confusing."
1,Too Scary!,"I read the reviews about this book and really wanted to read it. Well, I hate to ruin this books reputation, but I have to tell the truth. I think this book is too scary. I only got to the second chapter and I'm already getting nightmares. It may get better along the way, but it just doesn't draw me in."
1,Worst book ever!,"This book is not worth paying a cent for! It is just not meant to be read! I really wish my teacher isn't making us read this!!! I have read some other pretty bad books, but this doesn't even compare! #1 worste book ever!"
5,Inspiring Read,"The Dark is Rising sequence by Susan Cooper has and always will be my favorite books. It is an epic tale of the battle of good and evil and the chosen few with the ability to stop The Dark from rising. I believe the strongest theme of the story is that children can have a profound effect on the world around them, and through seemingly small and meaningless acts can change the world forever. This is portrayed through the Drew children and later through Will and Bran. They all have their tasks to play and each one, no matter how special, will effect the course of humanity forever.The books are packed full of wonder, magic, and adventure. And not a small dose of Arthurian legend. I encourage all to read these books no matter what their age. Share the magic with your families. ^_^"
5,"Congo ""Monkey"" the Gorilla","it's amazing how i'm an older kid and i still can't sleep without my ""Monkey"". When i got ""congo"" (who's to name these beloved things????) as a baby, i thought she was a monkey, so that became her name. People might say that this stuffed animal isn't durable... Monkey went through my toddler years with the fur on the mouth ripped out by yours truly, a chipped eye from a ceiling fan accident, another chipped eye from my brother, and a chipped nose from playing soccer with her as the ball. This stuffed animal has survived all these years, and is now held together by what was oringinally holding her together. this stuffed animal is so special!!!! (and how is a stuffed animal supposed to be ""educational""?)"
4,Good overview of Vatican diplomacy with powerful dictators,"Good overview by several noted scholars of the Vatican's political relationship with powerful dictators of influential European states, ranging from Napoleon and France to Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The concordat was a Vatican document used from the 12th century until the 20th century, culminating during the interwar years, and now somewhat outmoded since the death of Pius XII in 1958 and the changes of the Vatican II Council thereafter focusing more on the spiritual rather than the temporal aspects of the Vatican's role in the world."
5,I loove this machine.,"It is a nice machine and it is SILENT. No noise at all. I had bought the electric thermostat control from Delonghi and it made a small buzz. This makes no noise.Very simple to use, it adjust to the temperature of the room. So if the room is on and you set it for 75 degrees it will not go on past 77 degrees. I think it ranges from 2 degrees below to 2 degrees above."
3,Loud cracking,"no smell, very good temperature (we have it in our baby room!), but when the thermostate comes on, sometimes it cracks REALLY loud, sometimes little one wakes up."
1,"This heater may work one season, if you're lucky","worked ok the first year.turned off automatically after 10 minutes the next year.got a replacement from Honeywell (took them about a month to send me a new one. a COLD month. it worked ok for 3 months until winter was over.)the following winter, it would turn off intermittently, but usually would stay on long enough to heat the living room.this year, today is the first cold day.heater shuts off IMMEDIATELY after turning it on, every time.I have come to the conclusion that this heater is a piece of ----.I still have a warranty. Do I want to wait another cold month for Honeywell to send me a new piece of ----?Probably I'll just buy a Delonghi and call this Honeywell a loss.Needless to say: I suggest avoiding this heater."
1,Shuts off.,"I bought this unit in January 2006 and it worked fine the first season (as others have described). In the 2006-2007 winter, it started doing that intermittent shutting off and this season I can't even get it to stay on long enough to heat up. If it does have something to do with a proximity snsor it is way too sensitive and Honeywell needs to let consumers know what it is (no object within __ feet), in case your room is too crowded for the heater. The other problem, of course, is a thermostat that is immediately next to the radiator. But this pales in comparison to the fact the after two seasons the radiator does not work at all!!! I will update if Honeywell does anything to rectify this..."
1,"not as reliable as one would think,,,,",We too have had issues with our Honeywell Oil Filled Radiator Heater as it continually shuts off for no reason in the middle of the night but also continues to blow circuits on almost every area of our house when we have it running on high... Not the best invention by a long shot as it has a lot of bugs in it.
1,708 is BAD but the 709 is AWESOME.,"OK, I have the 709 and I love it. No bad smell works great, heats well, does the job. So I bought 2 more for the other rooms in our house. I mistakenly got the 708 model. BOTH WERE BROKEN. The first automatically shuts off moments after turning it on. The other makes a horrible clicking sound, and randomly either ignores the temperature setting and goes to 85 (even when its set at 70) and now randomly shuts off.That said, I bought them from Today's Concepts and they gave me absolutely no hassle in the return. I am returning them and getting the 709 model which I am very happy with."
3,The Remote lacks a few features.,"I was looking for a TV and VCR Universal control. This one looked like it'd fit the bill. I route the audio thru an AM/FM receiver, so I thought ""Cool! One less remote to hassle with."" This WAS a nifty feature!TV/VCR remotes should have a button that ""toggles"" between the two - television & video cassette player/recorder. This is the first universal remote that lacks this. And though this IS capable of VCR playback, it lacks a VCR button - I use the Sat[ellite] button for VCR.The Rewind, Play, Fast Forward, Record, Stop, and Pause are like an afterthought on this -- smallish and at the bottom of the Remote.PIP, SWAP, GUIDE, SLEEP are unnecessary buttons for my analog TV. Input & Menu are nice."
3,"On the disappointing side, for the price","It was a lot smaller than we thought it would be, and a lot flimsier than we expected. We bought a HUGE (4'x 6') Radiator Springs rug for $20 that is MUCH more rugged and durable, even the colors are brighter. This one was $18 plus shipping, and is small and dingy-looking. If something gets spilled on it and we wash it once, I'm sure it'll fade even more. Plus the fabric is a velour-type, which everything sticks to. I usually only review things we love, but had to take the time to steer others away from this and towards just about any other Radiator Springs merchandise you can find. We have it all and this one was our first disappointment. Sorry!"
1,My kids don't play with this toy!,This toy is good for laying tiny lego pieces on (to keep them all together)when building a lego model. We use it for this reason with the red side up! Other than this...my kids don't play with this toy.
5,one to share and one to eat,"I purchased two of the 6 cup bundt pans to use with a recipe that made 12 cups of batter, which was too much for a standard bundt pan. The two 6 cup pans accommodated the recipe perfectly! The cakes were beautifully cooked and released perfectly, producing two cakes that were just the right size for gifting one and enjoying the other with my family. I would strongly recommend this pan but would encourage the purchase of two of them for the sake of convience."
4,FYI.....This is not a regular size pan,"Oh, I was shocked! Not for making a regular bundit cake..However I did have fun revamping my old stand by cakes.Ideal for small group of friends to eat this size cakeOh ,prepare pan it will stick."
4,Light weight but cooks great,"I ordered this bundt pan hoping that it would be heavy duty like the other Nordic Ware 6 cup bundt pans I have. It is definitely not heavy duty but it cooked my Rum Cake as good, if not better, than the heavy duty pan. And it cleaned easier."
4,Only 6 Cups,"This is a well made pan with a nice finish. Six cups is a small Bundt Cake pan.Have you ever bought something the wrong size? A standard box cake will yield 6 cups of batter, but you need more room for the cake to rise in a Bundt cake. So unless you want to make this with cup cakes. You might want to get the bigger pan."
1,"If You Like Burnt Cake, This is the Pan for You.","The Nordic Ware Pro Form pan should be renamed Burnt Pan, not Bundt Pan. The Pro Form is Nordic Ware's lowest quality pan. It is their lightest weight, thin aluminum pan. I have always used their heavy weight pans and so I did not realize that this was more or less ""five and dime"" bakeware. Followed the directions exactly, correct temperature, greased and floured, etc., etc., Approximately 15 minutes after the cake was in the oven, I smelled burning so I ran downstairs, checked the stove, the thermometer, etc. and everything was fine. HOWEVER, I removed the pan from the oven and the entire outside of the cake (top and bottom) were burned to a crisp. Thankfully, the cake came out of the pan easily and I threw it away and made another cake using their platinum series and everything was fine. You get what you pay for and this pan, although budget priced, was totally inferior."
3,"Okay, but...","The cover, of a bunch of middle-aged to elderly white musicians, indicates what's meant by Dixieland here. At least half the numebrs have nothing to do with New orleans or chicago Jazz, original or revived. The irrelevant pieces include good stuff, but where's Panama? Climax Rag? Pretty Baby? Snag It? On and On Blues? (just kidding...."
4,A Christmas present for my Brother,"I bought this video, Jillian Michaels: Shred-it With Weights, for my Brother. He says its a pretty good video. Four Stars"
1,Do Not Purchase!,"Okay... I love this woman. She got me interested in working out with kettlebells... but I also did my research. Her form here is HORRIBLE. She literally has no idea what she is doing. Her swing can throw a back out, and you call that a get up? If you're truly interested in kettlebells look up Lauren Brooks or Tracy Reifkind. BOTH are Russian Kettlebell Certified. You will learn proper form and see results fast. Not just weightloss but strength and stability.Better yet do what I did... find a certified trainer using Dragondoor and train under them. I am using heavier weights too... a woman starting out for example, if using PROPER form, should start with 25lb swing. I am currently swinging 45lbs, deadlifting 90... etc etc. But if you were to try those weights using Jillians form... you would find yourself in the hospital."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I'm a big fan of Jillian's, but this DVD is awful. Many exercises have you hyperextending your joints and many moves are ludicrous. I guess that if you're a big enough name you can slap any DVD together and get people to buy it."
2,I guess I am not Jillian Michaels fan,"Unfortunately, this is the first DVD I have ever got from Jillian Michaels.I do love her attitude, I do not find her annoying.I just do not care for her style - I am prone to injury and I am no longer in my 20s - I try to do workout that is more conservative and simple that get's me results.I did level 1 few times - work out is about 20 minutes but for me it was too short sice I did not want to attempt some of her exercises.Out of curiously - I watched level 2 and there are a lot more moves that I would not want to attempt.To me these are dangerous moves. And as I said before I have never seen any of her other DVDs.This also not a good DVD if you never done kettlebells:For beginners and advanced: Bob Harper: Kettlebell Sculpted Body is awesome - he explains how you suppose to use kettlebells."
5,The BEST workout!,"I am in love with this DVD! Jillian Michaels is an amazing trainer and I love working out with her. She is hard, but she delivers results. I have been working out with her videos for only 3 months and I have lost 21 pounds, 2 pant sizes, and inches around my waist! SO excited, I ordered 4 more of her videos and I reccommend this to anyone who wants to get in an intense workout in only 30 minutes, but you must be prepared to sweat and work hard, but you will see amazing results!"
5,Great workout,I love this workout. I have lost inches and toned in so many areas.. I want another kettle bell DVD from Jilliam. She has the best workouts!
4,Fun and Challenging,"This was my first Jillian workout and my first workout with kettlebells. I've done several other dvds in the past with other instructors from The Firm to Denise Austin to Brooke Benten. It was the one of the hardest workouts for the amount of time I put into it, and it was a blast. I love to switch it up because I get bored with exercise easily, so this is one I will definitely be working into the routine a couple of times a week."
5,Jullian Michael,Her video is great. I got it because I loved her on the biggest loser and the workout video is exactly what I thought it would be
2,Disappointed User,Very disappointed with this workout. Not nearly as challenging as I had hoped it would be. And Jillian talks too much.
4,Good workout,"I was excited to get this workout especially after noticing that JM was even more ripped than her previous DVDs. It is a good workout very similar to 30 Day Shred in intervals but there doesn't seem to be enough cardio. I agree with the review that said watch the tutorial. You will need to make sure you are comfortable with the Kettle Bell before you attempt the workout.Pros: New workout, using the kettlebell, new movesCons: I think it needs more ab work although the kettle bell is supposed to work your core.All in all a good workout under 30 minutes."
3,Be careful!,"First off I am a huge JM fan, however I am disappointed in this workout. I never used kettleball, so I thought I would try this with an 8lbs. weight before purchasing a kettleball. I am only on level one, but found the workout to be easy. My heart rate stayed near 130 and only jumped up when we did the one cardio jump exercise. I thought some of the exercises were not safe, especially with first time kettleball users. Normally with a Jillian workout I feel the burn the next day and so far I am not soar and I have done this DVD 3 times this week, I don't feel like I got a workout. I also don't like that she doesn't specify on how many days a week to do this workout. Normally circuit training is done every other day, but not feeling a burn with this, I almost think you should do it everyday, but not sure. I personally don't recommend this workout, as I stated above, I think someone could really hurt themselves with this."
2,Disappointed...,"I wished I would have waited before purchasing this DVD. I did work out to the DVD a couple of times but some how injured my back and was unable to workout for approximately 1 1/2 weeks. I tried to emanate the moves that Jillian showed in the tutorial and in the work out session itself. I've heard nothing but bad reviews regarding this DVD where they state that her form is incorrect. I actually spent $[...] on the Nordictrack Kettlebell only to find out that I may not be able to use it. Either that or I need to find a real expert that knows what they are teaching. I don't understand how a DVD can be sold without it going through some type of approval from the real experts. Jillian has always inspired me and I have most every DVD of hers and this is why I bought it. I will continue to follow her, but will be much more careful in the future before blindly buying before researching it."
4,Great Workout,I love the workout and feel the burn each time but it seems like she is selling her kettle bell product throughout the DVD which is annoying. I turn the volume off when I use this DVD and listen to my own music now that I know the moves.
3,Not sure yet,This is hard for a beginner and I'm not sure how accurate the moves are as I've already hurt my shoulder. I've been advised to look at the DVD's by Pavel Tsatsouline instead.
5,Love it,I have been using this dvd for a few days now and I love it.. I can def feel the burn.. Would highly recommend this anyone who wants to workout at home.
4,A Bit Mellow,"To get the maxium benefit out of this workout, a kettlebell has to be used. I have been working out with all of JM's videoes and find this one (I have done both level 1 and level 2)to be a bit mellow. Personally, JM's No More Trouble Zone is the best workout. Or a combination of two levels of 30 Shred in one workout is the beast. I am pre-ordering her 6 week six pack to see how that one is."
4,Pretty good,"The first time I did this DVD I was pretty disappointed until about half ways through, the Level 1 I felt was a little too easy and I didn't work up much of a sweat, but Level 2 was killer! I did both Level 1 and 2 back to back and I am definitely sore today! It's not her best workout, but it's a good alternative to her DVD series to change things up a bit!"
5,"Great workout, but be careful!","(not Joe, this is his wife) This was my first Jillian Michaels workout, and I loved it! I was afraid when I read the word ""cardio"", which in my mind means fast, but it was slow and controlled. My heart rate was definitely up and I was sweating a lot. I say be careful because of the kettlebell. I don't have a kettlebell and used an 8 pound weight. There are several moves where you are swinging the kettlebell toward the front--if you aren't careful, you could swing it right into your TV! I decided to move to the side in case I accidently let go of the weight so I wouldn't destroy the TV :)"
4,Great workout for 30 minutes,I was able to get the SHRED IT Level 1 on Demand. It was a great workout. I would say it is lot like SHRED level 1 but working out with weight the whole time. You do not need a kettle bell for this routine a regular 3 to 8 pound weight will do. I will update tomorrow on how my muscles feel.
1,Terrible!,"Not only is Jillian annoying she has no idea what she is doing! Total waste of money, time and patience!"
2,Disappointed,I have several of Jillian Michaels workouts and love them. This one however was a big disappointment. I would of expected more from jillian. I felt like no sooner had I started the workout it finished. I prefer Jari Love Workouts.
1,Warning! Injury alert! Michaels' form is all wrong.,"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE...Do a little research before buying this. There are several articles out about how bad this DVD could potentially be for novice exercisers. You could potentially injure yourself by doing the exercises the way Jillian Michaels teaches them on this DVD. Please, do yourself a favor. If you're going to begin working out AND/OR working out with weights, get with a LICENSED (unlike Michaels, who is simply a TV personality in trainers' clothing) physical trainer and learn to do exercises properly. It's WELL worth the cost in the long run. BTW, I'm NOT a trainer. After several months of physical therapy, chiropractic, and acupuncture for both a hip and a shoulder injury, however, I just know from experience how badly you can hurt yourself if you don't take the time, energy and - yes, even - money to train properly. With best wishes for health, wellness and injury-free workouts! :)"
3,Intense workout,Julian takes you to the next level of a workout. My option you need to be in fairly good shape before starting this DVD.
5,Love this work out program,Jillian kicks my butt over and over again with every dvd I purchase. And I have many! She's the best!
5,Super Fun Kettlebell Workout,This is a super fun workout! it targets all the major muscles. I have bad knees and this workout didn't hurt them one bit.
4,Great Video!,"I love Jillian Michaels videos! This one is no exception. Great for shorter workouts! Highly recommend this to anyone who loves Jillian's other videos or is looking for a quick, hard workout."
1,"No, No, No!!!","My husband and I have been doing the Kettleworx training for about 8 weeks now. We decided we wanted to try something different and the Jillian Michaels Shred-it tape was recommended by a couple of friends.The first level was fine. Not a great work out, as she doesn't focus on any one muscle group and work til exhaustion. At best, I was breathing heavy and I never felt like I was cutting muscle. The Kettleworx was far and away better at targeting specific muscle groups.The second level is just downright dangerous!! Her form is terrible and the moves she uses are sure to cause injury. After doing the level 2 tape three times now, I have spent two days in bed and been to the chiropractor once. If you talk to any kettle bell trainers, they will tell you to steer clear of this tape unless you enjoy back pain!!Don't do it!!!!"
1,Horrible form...look elsewhere.,"She may be popular, but that doesn't mean she knows what she's talking about. Her form is horrible and the only way she gets away with it is that the weight is so small. I've been studying kettlebell technique from specialists for the past two months and her form is dangerous. I recommend checking out the books by Pavel Tsautsouline (Enter the Kettlebell, for instance) instead. Youtube the keywords ""jillian michaels kettlebell response"" to find some informed views on her teaching."
4,Need a kettlebell for maximum results,"I am a huge fan of Jillian's videos and I have been using her videos consistently each day. I was very excited to see this new workout. After doing workouts such as Banish Fat Boot Metabolism, No More Trouble Zones and the 30 Day Shred, I was honestly expecting more from this workout. I did the level 1 workout with a 5 lb hand weight for a few days since I did not own a kettlebell and I hardly broke a sweat. My husband bought me an adjustable kettlebell at Walmart for about $80. I can say that the workout is much more intense with the use of the kettlebell. I had never used a kettlebell before and the workout caused bruising on my arms but I would definitely recommend a kettlebell for maximum results."
4,be careful,"I was so so so excited to try out this workout and kettlebell routine. Even the warm up is work! But at the end, I must say it is entirely bad on anyone's knees to do the jump-spin-squats (you jump and turn 90 degrees left to center to right, repeat). I decided to muscle through and do all the squats, and then found out I killed my knees and couldn't run for DAYS afterwards and it took two weeks before my knees finally stopped hurting! So yes, definitely either jump without the kettlebell or jump slower at your own (safer) speed...both is probably best."
3,Truly a Full Body Workout,"I consider myself a pretty advanced exerciser but I have never worked out with kettlebells before. After reading the reviews of this video I decided on a 20-pound bell. That proved to be almost too much for me. I got through level 1 and half of level 2. I was definitely sore the next day in a lot of muscles I wasn't expecting. This is a different kind of workout from regular weights and I look forward to trying it again. I do wish, however, that I had purchased an adjustable kettle bell rather than one 20 pounder. My one criticism regarding some of Jillian's videos is that they're too short. 25 minutes isn't a long enough workout."
5,What A Workout,I have been doing kettlebell workouts for about a few months. The kettlebell DVDs that I have used do not provide enough thought in explaining proper form when using this piece of equipment. This DVD does a good job of explaining how your form should be. I just think it is a good DVD if you are new to kettlebell and offers something new if you have been doing it for awhile. I hope JM comes out with an another volume of kettlebell workout DVD.
3,Disappointed,"I have most of Jillian's videos - 30 Day Shred, Burn Fat/Boost Metabolism, No More Trouble Zones. I love the 30-Day Shred and have done the video consistently for the past eight months. I have always worked out with cardio but started strength training with the Shred. I have built lean muscle and am very happy with the results. No More Trouble Zones is also a great video and very challenging.I was hoping for a new DVD similar to the 30-Day Shred because my body is adapting. I don't think this routine is nearly as challenging as the Shred or Trouble Zones. After months, I still struggle with them. I do not have a kettle ball and used a dumb bell. Maybe that is the problem? I will continue to use the DVD a few times a week to see if I can see any new results and will up the weight. But, I will probably end up going back to the Shred and No More Trouble Zones."
2,jillian's shred it,"i'm a huge jillian fan, and swear by her previous videos. however this was not at all like her previous ones. totally new technique and philisophy. if you're looking to add on to her previous style, this is not it. i wasn't happy with it. i'm sure it's good and it works, but i like her old style of upper/lower body combinations. this is all about momentum and swinging a heavy weight. not much cardio or strength involved. probably good for beginners."
2,Be careful especially if over 40,I am just over 40 and was really loving this dvd and so started to do harpers kettlebells as well only once though. I was really cautious though not fully doing the above the head moves as was worried to injure myself. So after months of doing this decided lets do everything Jillian does. Two and a half months on I really really regret this. The next morning I was in tears with the most terrible pain in my shoulder and arm. I had torn my shoulder tendon almost through. It has cost me around 1000 dollars so far in therapies and am still going. It is improving but cannot push my toddler in his pram for long or go food shopping without my older kids to assist. Bottom line is be careful and make sure you have good form. As for me I will never ever do kettlebells again as worried will finish off the tear and lose function in my arm!
1,Body Damaging,"This video is awful. Jillian has you up and down and swinging weights with terrible form. I had been working out 4 to 6 days a week for 2 years and bought a few of her videos because I know her routines are supposed to be so intense and I wanted to break a plateau. I only ended up hurting my back badly. This injury has set me back for months now.Just because someone was hired by a network to ""run"" a fat camp doesn't mean she is a top notch fitness instructor. Lesson learned the hard way I guess."
1,Kettlebell Witch,"Stick with professional, certified kettlebell instructors to learn how to use kettlebells. Jillian is neither a pro nor certified as an instructor. Her poor form and lack of knowledge is evident. She also doesn't even know proper terminology. Save yourself an insurance claim for injury and skip this DVD."
4,Good Work Out,"I love this workout tape. It's intense, but beginner friendly. It really gets your heart pumping. Her use of the weight is a little reckless, and can be a big pain. However, overall I give this work out two thumbs up. I have lost so many inches since I first began 14 days ago. I LOVE Jillian Michaels ` work outs, They are made for anyone who wants to change their bodies and quickly."
4,Good workout!,"I had been searching for a great Kettlebell DVD and this one was perfect. I thought I could jump into the Level 2 workout; however, I went back to the Level 1 workout, and will slowly work my way to Level 2. The proper techniques are shown & the moves are easy to follow."
2,Bad form,"Pretty new to kettlebells. Just tried Level 1 this morning and was surprised at how she just tosses the kettlebell around. I'm not familiar with her other videos (I just liked her from Biggest Loser), but with me not even being that familiar with kettlebells, I could see right away that this is a video that you could get injured from. She doesn't use good form and doesn't try to tell the user how to perform the exercise safely. Probably going to pitch this one. I also bought the Bob Harper kettlebell video and it is very hard and I feel he gives more safety tips and has you performing the exercises with much better form."
3,Not for Me,"I'm a huge Jillian fan and have all of her videos - this is my least favorite. I have an Everlast kettle bell, 10 lb. that seemed good for me, but the handle is small and I struggled with changing hands. Maybe it's my coordination...or my finger nails.I could feel the workout the next day, but initially after the workout I felt a little cheated.Looking for something new and not getting it from this video I went and bought Jackie Warner's Power Circuit Training - I LOVE it! Jillian won't loose me as a fan, but she does have some competition! I'll try Jillian's 6-pack abs as soon as it comes out, but also plan to get Jackie's new workout too.So - with the right kettle bell...an no finger nails...this may be a good workout for your rotation. Mine, however, is already for sale on ebay."
5,"Uuugh, this is hard!","I love Jillian's workouts because whether they're 20 minutes or 45 minutes, I always work up a sweat and always feel like I've worked hard. This kettlebell workout is a fantastic challenge - great cardio and wieght bearing. I always feel this workout the next day. It's a good one - both level 1 and level 2."
2,Love Jillian... but this DVD is painful,"I have four of Jillian's DVDs and she is definitely my favorite trainer. However, the first time I did this workout, my back felt sore. I thought it was a weird thing, but I held off on doing it again for several weeks. Then, I tried it again and - wow, I was in pain afterward. I have been on bedrest for two days with sharp pains in my hip and lower back. I am in decent shape, I work out with Jillian a lot, and was following her form exactly just to be sure I didn't injure myself. But still, I definitely did and now I will not do this video again. And, even more unfortunately, I am going to have to take it easy with any exercises for several weeks. I will definitely buy another Jillian DVD, but never one with kettlebells."
3,Northern Vt,"Already had the two Bob Harper Kettlebell workouts, and love them, so thought I'd like this one...but....it is alright. I use it occasionally, for a change, but it is definatley not for beginners."
2,Disappointed,"I love Jillian and own many of her workouts (30 Day Shred, BFBM, NMTZ and Yoga Meltdown) and her first book (Winning by Losing). But I was disappointed with this video and very glad I tried it on Netflix before buying. I don't own a Kettlebell and used a 8 lb dumbbell. Not only did I not feel like it was effective, the moves were not explained very well. I am usually drenched in sweat and feel like I got in a good workout after a Jillian video, but not with this one."
4,"So far, so good!","Have done levels 1&2 with 5 pound kettlebell and did level 1 last night with a 10 pound kettlebell.If you haven't used a kettlebell before, watch the tutorial and research proper form. You can easily hurt yourself doing this workout the wrong way."
2,Wow. Could it get any more cheezy?,"I love the SC books. But the shows and movies are terrible. Aren't they supposed to be in Virginia? Why do they all have a British accent if their all from and in VA? It's not a good movie, but its addictive. Buts its not worth three bucks. I liked it the first time, but now I'm like, wow. Just... wow. So yeah, I suggest not buying it."
2,What a Disappointment!,"My daughter watches this excellent show all the time. We have taped several episodes and were thrilled to see a ""new"" movie.Well, after searching for weeks and finally finding it, we get it home and the ""movie"" is several of the old episodes. Since the girls are now teenagers on the tv series, we believed this to be a sequal so-to-speak from their last movie. The only part my daughter watches is the extras by some girls who really ride and care for their horses at a stable. To someone who has never seen the show, they would be very happy with it. But to those of us who have been fans for years, it was a disappointment."
3,Good And Bad,"this movie is good but the actors are fake at some parts the best actor is Heli Simpson AKA Veronica its good movie but it doesnt fallow the books the series barley fallows the books in my opion the books are way better but i dont think its fair that austraila gets all the cds stuffed an=imals cloths CD's we olny get the 3 items Adventures at pine hollow, first adventure, and the PC game"
3,Not the best Saddle Club movie,"This was A good movie exept that they spent most of there time looking for Veronica and that in the begining Lisa was freinds with spoiled Vreonica Di Angelo.Thy also left out a lot of stuff that was in the book.Don't by this movie!Also,Stevie liking a guy?This is not a good movie."
1,"2 7/8"" Not 3""","This product is 2 7/8"" not 3"" it will not fit 3"" pipe. The manufacture tag even stats 2 7/8"". Product is misrepresented."
3,Returned shoes,"Returned shoes due to fit. Shoes were very narrow and stiff. Also, the heel is fairly low. I had expected it to be a bit higher."
1,VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SHOES,"shoes are very uncomfortable, it hurts the front of your feet, leather is very uncomfortable, i wouldn't advise you to purchase this, no wonder its so cheap!"
4,good for the $$$$,"Just finished putting this saw together for my son. For the price it is a good saw and he ordered the Besyemeyer fence, which is excellent (except for install instructions, lol). He also ordered the mobile base for it which is well built but had to be exchanged because the original was wrong size for saw. Assembly of the saw is really a 2 person job n takes about 3-4 hrs. Except for the fact that the 2 side extensions were not flat (have hi/low spots of .003-.005) where the connect to the main table it was fairly easy. Be prepared tho, you need to order the insert or build one so you can complete set up. The saw ran well and cut square after very little fine tuning. A very good alternative to a Unisaw, especially for garage work and the money you save."
5,"Great saw, great price.","Tablesaw arrived quickly and in top condition. Setup was fast and painless: the necessary adjustments on fence, etc. were just what one would expect on any high-end saw. Two bits of advice to pass on. One: fasteners are both metric and standard so don't get them mixed up. Two: fasteners provided for the extension table on my saw were incorrect so sorting everything out and getting the correct fasteners first will save you time and grief. Finely, if your new saw is replacing an older one, cut out the extension table parts on your old saw before hauling it off. It's much easier than trying to rip up sheet goods on a saw without a fully functional fence system. Even with the minor hassles with fasteners, I'll give this one five stars: great saw at a great price."
2,very disappointed,"I must admist I expected more from this book. The material covered is great, and so is the presentation. What is anoying, is that the authors do not prove half of the theorems and propositions. The proofs they provide (when they provide them) are great, but many people, who need to know the why's and how's of the theory, will have a hard time (unless they had seen this material before). So, it's a great reference book, but not a great learning tool."
3,like a dinner with bad appetizers,"I got this book for a 2 semester course in probabilistic snooch smacking. I was too stupid to get that first part with all the distributions and stuff. Looks like the odds were against me. I don't blame Bert, I blame Lawrence."
5,vibrant colors,"I love this rug! The picture does not do it justice - the colors are much more vibrant in real life. It has a soft, cushy feel when you walk on it in bare feet. All my animals (2 dogs, 3 cats) love the feel of it, too! We unrolled it, turned to put the table back on it and it was covered with animals! I just ordered the 2 next smaller sizes to complete the media room, too."
3,Not Looking for Pity,"It's not often I read work by a minority writer that doesn't rely on the sentimental exoticism of childhoods spent in foreign countries, magic spells, unfamiliar rituals and that kind of thing. Ed Vega tells it like it is and how he wishes it could be in these stories, and it's a heartbreaking collection that details lives lived on the fringes. Vega doesn't flinch from writing what he knows and letting us know that he knows it. Bravo! Slick, populist writing that's not ashamed of itself. Should be on the best seller lists right along side writers like King, Proulx, Rowling, and all the rest. Highly recommended for anybody who wants to know what it's like to yearn."
5,Meant to be heard not read!!,"An HBO movie was made of the play starring Jonathan Price, Uma Thurman and Paddy Considine. In the hands of these artists, the dialogue is nuanced, hopeless, vicious, desperate, lonely, often cruel and rarely funny. They took my breath away. I think it helps if you have a passing aquaintance with addiction. I would view the book as the written record of this performance. Catch it if you can.Jodywww.daybreaklavenderfarm.com"
4,Fun!!!,This is a great way to learn. I really enjoyed it. The DVD is an excellent addition to learning to play and the CD with it helps you to hear what is being played so you can match it.
5,Worthwhile purchase,"This book is geared towards the beginning drummer. Instructions are clear and lessons well written, and it includes a CD for audio learners. If you can't learn to drum with this handbook, give up! It's well worth the purchase price."
4,"Book is great, CD is pretty good","As a beginner I find the book to be very good, it breaks everything down and gives you steps to learn the patterns. I would give the book a 5 star rating.The CD is pretty good. The first song, Kuku, is easy to play along with as are some of the others. But on some of the songs, the patterns are played too fast, and I could not keep up, I even had trouble hearing all the drum beats. It would have been very helpful to me if the patterns were played more slowly at first.The final 5 tracks, Jaguar at Half Moon Lake (parts 1-5), are nice, there is music, singing and drumming. But, I would have preferred something in the style of what was taught in the book, maybe even the same songs that were taught with a full drum circle."
3,djembe,"I wish this was a dvd as the cd just left me cold. I didn't like just audio instruction even tho the book was there. I will probably go to a drum group to learn ""how to"". I didn't realize that I would need the visual aspect so much. I am sure for an audio learner this would be fine."
3,It does the job as far as I can tell,"Not much to say really. It only serves as a deterrent. It's bright and conspicuously attached to the wheel, which makes a possible thief think twice before attempting to break into your car. Well worth it for the $25 price tag! I also use a break lock which is more durable and more likely to stop a thief from actually stealing the car if s/he decides to break the windows anyways. However, as I said before, this wheel lock performs its job well as a deterrent."
1,Cheap and Differs from Picture,"I was very pleased to receive my steering wheel lock, but was let down when I removed it from it's horrible packaging. It was cheap, flimsy, and smelled very bad. You really do get what you paid for here."
5,Not the Best? Maybe. One of the Best? Definitely!,"The reviewer from Sedona makes an invalid comparison of Larry Mak's book with two others. Secrets of Modern Slot Playing is a how-to book. As such, it provides only the essential information the average slot player really needs to know. A how-to book by its nature does not go into the elaborate detail the Sedona reviewer finds missing. Also, the Sedona reviewer's phrase ""not one of the best books"" is not strictly correct from a logical point of view. Technically, there can be only one ""best book,"" although we use the phrase ""one of the best"" in everyday speech. But what is the point of ranking three good books of different sorts? That is such a subjective exercise. Secrets of Modern Slot Playing is a handy guidebook that provides tips to make anyone's visit to a casino more enjoyable and rewarding."
4,Fast reading and Fun,"This was a quick read and a lot of fun as well. Filled with information that ran from common sense to the intricacies of computer slots. Lots of jokes, and sensible tips for enjoying you slot time without loosing your shirt."
5,Great CDRW Portable Player,"Bought this one on blind faith, there was no description, and no mention of it at the Philips website. However, it has the same features as the AZ9101 'blue' version also listed at this site. It's got ESP3-40 sec Antishock, a 20 hour battery life, power saving, and best of all CDRW compatibility.The sound is great, I just tried recording a CDRW of some MP3's I have, and it's bloody superb! The only grumble I have at all with this player is the low volume, even at the highest setting it doesn't really blast your ears off. Though the clarity is excellent, even with bass boost, so if this is my tradeoff, I'm well happy.Now all I've got to do is buy a replacement PSU unit so I can power it when I'm back in the UK, different plugs y'see."
2,really good for a while......,"THis player worked great at first. it had double bass boost, programable tracks, shuffle, and repeat. it also won't skip the only down things were the volume i could barely hear it on loud buses and stuff and the earphones. i listened to it everyday but then it happend. it started to play out of only the right side of any headphones i put in it so i had to switch it to mono to hear out of each. now i miss any music that comes out of only left side of the headphones. then it wouldn't open so each time i wanted to switch cds i had to pry it open. also the blue on it gets finger prints pretty easily. that all happend like a year after i got it. i suggest going with sony but if your not going to use it that much go ahead and buy it"
2,Very Basic Bag,"I needed a basic bag to travel with & lash my 19"" tripod to my carry-on camera backpack. The shoulder strap is a fixed (I wish it were removable) and the material is very thin, shiny, and smooth and keeps slipping out of the lashing straps even if I double wrap them.This bag is very cheap in both cost an construction & I probably wouldn't recommend it for anyone who wants something more than a simple bag for light duty/dust protection (not waterproof) or the most basic of bump protection (not padded). It will almost work for my purposes, but I'm not sure the smallish zipper will hold up well to a lot of opening/closing and semi-rugged incidental abuse, so I am already searching for a replacement."
5,ex-subhumans best,"This is THE standout album from the best ska/punk band around these days. As always, the lyrics are hyper-intelligent, socially conscious rants that provoke real thought but never become preachy. Dick has never sounded better and the music reaches new levels of precision for this veteran band. Honestly, I've worn out my disk player with this album. It's easily one of the best ska/punk efforts ever released. Just buy it!"
2,A good start...,"I'm sorry. I guess I'm an island here and stand alone, but this book didn't impress me. I think perhaps with time, the author will develop an incredible talent, but it didn't shine through this time. The book was readable, but the plot was predictable and shallow. The style seemed misplace--almost like he hadn't quite found his own voice yet. It's a great first effort--but I can't understand the Clancy comparisons. It definitely does not fall in that class."
1,Didn't realize they were ALL nylon,"I didn't read the posting very thoroughly and didn't realize they were solid nylon. One of them snapped off when I gave it the final turn to tighten it. I ended up pulling the interior off my rear hatch on my Lexus RX to get it out. I went to a local hardware store and bought stainless steel ones for 13 cents each and I'm using them instead.Also I wanted to note that the phillips head on these screws is quite unorthodox. you'll notice that it's just two slits and not angled like most screws are. Anyway you'll find that if you have a toolbox full of screwdrivers, only one will fit these screws."
3,Should be stronger,"I know these are plastic. I was being very careful to give just the right amount of torque to get it tight, but not too tight.Nevertheless, I snapped the head of one of the four right off and then had a mild ordeal getting the now headless bolt out of the license plate frame mounted nut.Yes, I know they're plastic (and they do look sharp, as my previous black bolts were rusting) but that one snapped a little too easily.For reference, these work well with my 2006 VW Touareg, but I did have to trim ~6 mm from the bolt to get it to seat properly. Being plastic makes them very easy to cut with wire cutters."
1,NOT What You See In The Photo,"First of all, the photo is a blatant lie. I too was looking for black fasteners to create a clean and neat license plate installation. The photo/ad implies a lot by minimally saying you are buying ""Nylon fasteners"" with the photo of stainless steel nylon locking nuts. In reality you are purchasing completely nylon screws and nuts with all of them cast in black, nothing is metal/stainless steel and it will not tolerate anything more than a ""snug"" tightening. Just simply don't buy these and look somewhere else for hardware."
1,Poor purchase decision.,"Thought a rust free option would be nice, however these stripped so quickly and easily it was rediculous. I got them about 50% fastened when it really started to strip. I then immediatly tried to remove them with no success. Now I have the fun task of trying to remove what's left of them from my bumper. Haven't figured it out yet.Learn from my foolishness and do not purchase these problems."
1,Weak Nylon Screws,The screws are incredibly weak. All of them snapped when tightening into pre-drilled license plate holes. I suggest staying away from these and all Nylon screws.
3,Plastic feel,"Positives: Fits my car (2007 Infiniti G35) license plate holes. Strong enough to do its job.Negatives: In the picture, screws and fasteners look metallic, but it's important to note ""Nylon"" in the title. Screws and fasteners have plastic feel. I hope they last long time, but I have my doubts.Overall, I am satisfied with the purchase. Screws are longer than it looks. Screwheads are smaller than I expected. But they work well with cruisers screw covers."
1,Did NOT Fit,"The screws do not fit my BMW 3-series license plate holder. D. Hoskins's reviews also mentioned that these screws don't fit his BMW X3.So if you own a BMW, these screws are most likely the wrong size.buyers beware! product is MISLABELED. the screws are NOT for ALL imports!"
3,Decent Resource,"A general overview of how to utilize the Anglican New Church Teaching Series in faith formation, as well as some very general information on how to organize retreats, classes, educational moments and the like. The author reviews each of the books within the series, and provides a general overview on the wuthors as well as the topics covered. A suggested activity and approach also accompanies the discussion of each bookin the series. Additionally, this book identifies which elements of the series might be most appropriate for various groups in the Church - such as eucharistic ministers, lay readers, faith formation and the like. In general, the book will probably be of assistance to a Director of Religious Education or moderator - especially one new to either religious ed or the series, but is of limited use to the individual looking to utilize the series as a method of individual faith formation or discovery."
2,Not so great,"The propod 5 is not for you.Fluid head is not generally fluid but jerky - mostly on the vertical tilt. The legs are not a standard quick locking type but rather require you to ""unspin"" each leg at two different levels. This is not easy to do in any setting. Not to mention the tripod weighs almost 10 pounds so it's tough to hang on to while you're adjusting it. This is supposed to be a heavy duty tripod but parts are constantly coming unscrewed and plastic protective pieces falling off. These tripods come with no documentation or service manuals of any kind. The only thing close is a small piece of paper that says ""Smith Victor 5 year limited warranty"" and has a phone number for support. The support is helpful but these are not worth the money or the trouble. Spend a little more money. Go with a Bogen."
1,Burn danger,"I literally had to throw this away the other day after using it, and burning myself on it, for 3 months. The entire case and glass door gets so hot during use that it burns skin. Horrible. I can't bend one of my fingers because my knuckle got burnt so badly on the *outside* of the glass door.Oh yeah, I forgot to mention....the word ""power"""" on the front of the unit reads ""POEWR"". Nice."
1,Takes FOREVER to toast!,"If you have 45 minutes to wait for toast, then this is the toaster for you. Serioulsy, I have to put my toast in b/f I shower, then I shower, dry off...etc...get dressed, do my hair, do my make up, then go out and my toast is just about done! 45 minutes later! This thing is so slow and underpowered I could toast faster on my sidewalk in January. BTW I live in the north. I have 3 friends that have the same toaster and they all agree. DO NOT BUY THIS TOASTER!"
2,POEWR ON,"That wasn't a typo, the power indicator on the front actually reads ""POEWR"". How did that make it past quality control?When I asked for a toaster oven for Christmas, I specifically said ""NOT EURO-PRO"", but got this anyway. I felt like Eric Forman not asking for an eight-track player and getting one nonetheless...Anyway, I suppose that this machine does what it's supposed to do, although it does get the kitchen very warm in the process and kinda feels junky. The only issue I have besides the POEWR light is the pan that came with it. It has a raised platform in the middle, which cuts it's usable surface area down to about the size of half a piece of bread. Why would they do that? It makes no sense. So instead of fitting a dozen wings in the pan, I can now fit three, otherwise they'll roll off the slant. Stupid. Great job Euro-Pro!"
1,Absolutely Awful ... and Manufacturer is even worse!!!,"Two weeks after buying it, the knob cracked. The two replacement knobs EuroPro sent us didn't fit this model. By that time, the thermostat broke and the heating elements would not stay on for more than 30 seconds and then stopped completely. Toast was barely warm --- I'd have to fan out the oven to cool it down, wait 5 minutes and try again. We finally gave up and sent it back. We received a replacement yesterday, but the knob-side of the oven was crushed in. It was not damaged during transit --- the box and styrofoam were perfect --- we were actually shipped a seriously damaged unit probably to teach us a lesson. We're not going to send it back ... we're going to throw it out and get a totally different toaster oven made my a reputable company."
4,10 years and still going strong!,"Over 10 years ago, I was in Macy's and saw this toaster oven for $19.95. It is a large capacity and bakes and broils. I already have a convection oven with my GE Advantium Microwave, so don't need another convection anything. I saw at that time that reviews were pretty sketchy on all models, but they couldn't be any worse than my 5 Toastmasters,4 Black & Deckers, and 1 Oster. I use this toaster oven a lot and it's held up beautifully except that the white around the door of the oven is discolored, and all the scrubbing and cleaning won't get it off. Other than that, I love it. None of my toaster ovens have lasted more than 2 years. When it finally goes to it's grave, I will buy a Breville or a Cuisinart. I won't get this lucky again.....................(I must be very hard on toaster ovens over the 35+ years I have been with my husband.)"
1,EuroPro Toaster TO1612,"I received the EuroPro toaster as a gift from my family. The first thing that caught our attention was the incorrectly spelled POEWR--should be POWER. We thought okay, it wasn't made in USA. Then we noticed the timer was not reliable - you need to check on your items before time is up. Then, with no warning, while baking food, blueish sparks and smoke started coming from the right side of the unit. The unit is now dead and it was only about 8 months old. The ease of cleaning this machine was nice but the other issues make me hesitant to purchase another toaster from EuroPro."
1,PLEASE don't buy this for a toaster,"As a toaster, this thing is a waste of space. Admittedly gone are the days when you buy a B&D toaster oven for 19.95 and it lasts 10 years (or until the burnt cheese buildup on the bottom reaches the heating element and you chuck it). But, there's gotta be a better option out there. It looks like some folks like this one as a backup ""oven,"" and that I can maybe see. The problem is the timer. Twist to a certain mark one time, 30 seconds. Same mark again, 40 seconds. Know what that means for toast? Bad things, man, bad things. Relying on the timer to tell you to check your stuff? Don't. It may go off, it may not. No rhyme or reason. If you make your toast some other way and need a backup oven, go for it. If you want a toaster that makes, uh, toast... Go elsewhere!"
1,burns toast - timer doesn't work,"Don't buy -- not even on sale! I agree with this reviewer who said -- If you make your toast some other way and need a backup oven, go for it. If you want a toaster that makes, uh, toast... Go elsewhere!The timer doesn't work - you have to watch it constantly or it burns toast.Also, after 8 months, the knobs are stripped and now we have to guess when setting the temp and function."
1,Good Price - Poor product,"I am writing this review because I feel that we purchased a product that didn't cut the mustard. Having the need for an oven in our RV (we travel full time) the Euro Pro TO 1612 toaster oven at Target caught our eye, the price was right, and we purchased it. Upon noticing the high heat on the outside which was melting a plastic water bottle, I checked the rest of the unit to find that it was extremely hot. The recipe book that came with it was gluing to the top, and I was afraid that it was too close to the rest of our wall. Then I noticed that the knobs were not lined up correctly, and then the timer did not ring at the end of the time we set. I am not happy with this product and we will be taking it back to Target, as I feel it is too dangerous."
2,White guy playin' the blues. Really disappointing.,"I was pretty disappointed with this album. Yes, Tony has some blazing chops, but all he's doing is playing recycled blues licks really fast over and over again. There's no originality to this record and the whole thing just sounds stale.As Tony Monaco goes, ""intimately live at the 501"" is a far more musical album."
5,Better than the rest.,"I've been considering which 12"" duel bevel saw I would purchase for about 6 months. I finally decided on the delta and am glad I did. It's a smooth operating piece of equipment. Solidly built. All gauges we're accurate from the start. I love the in-front bevel lock. The quick tightening mitre lock is nice as well. Overall, I'm thrilled with the purchase. It's worth paying a little more for."
1,Don't spend the money!!!,"The product does not properly fit the RAZR. Once trimmed to fit and placed, the crystals bring to fall off. This produst is $70 worth of crap!I'm sorry I had no choice below 1 star to rate it."
1,Junk,"I bought this item based on reviews at other websites as I found Amazon.com to be the cheapest price online. This item is junk and I am VERY disappointed I spent the money on it. It doesn't stick to our stone fireplace, and now I have an 8 month old baby who is susceptible to injury by our fireplace, and I'm out the $70 I paid for this item. I'd like to throw it all back in the box and ship it back for a refund, but I doubt I will be given one since we had to cut the item to size."
3,Fireplace Bumper,"The product would work well if it would stick to the brick. We are having trouble getting it to stay down. It does protect the corners and edges, but doesn't stay stuck to the brick ledge."
1,bumper pads,"Sorry, these don't work for us. Such a waste of money...they don't stay ""stuck"" to the cement hearth at all."
5,A must read,"As someone who has gone through the trauma of losing two dogs, I was tremendously touched by this wonderful story. This is a book that should be available in every Veterinarian's office, every Pet Cemetery, at every Dog Show and every Dog Supply store. Dog owners who lose their pets need a book like this, particularly children."
2,Not what I needed,"I needed something to tell me for sure where my best friend is now that he has passed. The author tries to build a case, but there is no assurance in what he says about the spiritual side of death. I do not mean the book is not good, it is. It just did not help me."
2,Second hand didn't work,"On arrival, I inspected the watch. The band was a little difficult to put on due to the tiny holes for the metal catch. More importantly, the second hand only ran sporadically. As a result, I returned the brand new, defective watch for a refund."
3,Quality Watch- inferior band,"The watch itself is a good quality product, but the watch band is inferior. There is a thin plastic covering on the leather that peels off quickly leaving an unsightly appearance. The band is not covered under Bulova's warranty. If you want the watch, get a replacement band and swap it out right away."
5,Good watch,Excellent watch and luxury I like these designs attractive and I'm happy to buy theseThe time from AmazonI wish to repeat the experience of another product as soon as
5,A nice watch,I got this watch for my dad's birthday and he was really happy with my gift. He likes good classy watches so that was perfect for him. So far it hasnt experienced any problem and i hope it will work well
4,Great watch,The watch is fashionable and it looks good in any situation. I have received two of them. The first was sent back because the surface of the band was coming off. The second one's band is starting to do the same thing but I guess I will just try to find a better band later. Bulova messed on when they chose this band.
4,Nice watch.,Bought this as a gift for my husband. Beautiful watch. Only issue was the band size. My husband is a bigger guy and it just barely fit him.
4,These Will Last Forever,"I have worn Propets for years, and they last forever. This is a very comfortable style and my legs thank me when I wear good shoes. Highly recommend."
3,lacks good arch support,"It is a comfortable shoe, but I had to add an arch support. It isn't true to size, either, I had to return and get 1/2 size smaller than I normally wear. I like the shoe, though, very comfortable and they come in the wide sizes I need."
5,whoa!!,"WOW!! this little card is so small and it holds so much!! I remember the old days where the maximum capacity for computer RAM was 64mb. Heck i even remember whem hard drives were smaller than that. I use it with my Nomad 2c (great player read my review) and it is awesome. really nothing can match it. its fast, portable, and spacious (well sort of). floppies are slow and large compared to this. The only bad thing would be that if you leave it in sunlight, throw it or just bend it, it seems as if it were going to break. but that's no reason why its should be keeping you from buting it...."
3,64 Meg Card Isn't Worth It,"The 64meg memory card is the largest capacity smart media card available but it is way too pricy. You can buy two 32 meg cars for 56$ each and it would be cheaper than buying one 64meg card! It would make no sense to buy this product. I get one hour of music on 32 megs for my Diamond Rio 500, I'm just going to go buy 2 32meg cards instead of this expensive and over rated 64meg POS"
4,1000 PICS in a match book that is as thin as a dime !,This card enables me to take about 1000 pictures (at the lowest resolution) with my Olympus 460. This is the largest smartmedia card you can currently buy and only has one minor draw back. The panorama feature is not available on Olympus cameras that have a panorama feature since this is not an Olympus brand card. Over all this is a great product. With such a high data capacity card as smartmedia USB reader is almost a must. I can download the 64 MB that are on this card in under 2 Minutes with a USB reader. Before with the serial connection that came with my camera it took (or felt like) hours!
5,Good Idea if you want more from your Rio 500.,"I purchased my Rio 500 two years ago and love it but at the time I thought the memory it came with was enough but now I purchased the 64 meg card and thanks to the reviews people put on Amazons site I downloaded the firmware and updated so my Rio 500 would take the 64 meg card. I couldnt get it to work at first but found out I had the card in up side down wich didnt look like it should go that way but the Rio recognised the external memory so if you have trouble keep working it will work in the 500. Here is the site I use to update the software, these folks have a super site for Rio players..."
1,He IS a murderer!!,Anyone who believes that this murderer is anything but a con-man and killer is deluded! He cold-bloodedly shot and killed a police officer who was just doing his job. Daniel Faulkner was brutally struck down by a man who flaunts it in society's face every day he draws breath. Celebrities and blind fools believe the fiction he continues to spew into the US and the world. Wake up people...HE IS GUILTY OF MURDER and Daniel Failkner died at his hands!!
1,Overwrought,"The author tries to pull from her own past to write a fresh story, I found it leaden and flat."
3,it was....,"Just okay, at best. Reading it wasn't a complete waste of time, but I could have read something else and never missed it."
3,Surprised...,"This book is about a girl named Lissa. She kissed her best friend Kate at a party, and Kate refuses to talk to her after that. Lissa is scared and confused about what happened, and she just wants to talk to Kate about how she felt. She doesn't have anyone to turn to...so she turns to her boss, and works a lot more. She works as a delivery girl- and her boss finds her a new co-worker. Her name is Ariel,and Lissa recognizes her from school. Ariel is different from a lot of the people at school. Ariel and Lissa become good friends. She sets Lissa up on a date with her guy friend. Her friend and Lissa go out to pizza. Her friends hand is a lot smaller than the other one, and Lissa is a little uncomfortable. But they end up being good friends.Lissa realizes her relationship with Kate will never be that same, and she just enjoys her new found friendship Ariel.This book was a little weird for my taste, and i really wouldn't recommend it for kids under 13."
1,horrible,"i was so happy when i first purchased this book but when i finally sat and read it, it was so boring and a drag it was a waste. The story had no purpose nothing was really going on it. This book is juss a waste don't buy this book i wish i coulda gave it no stars it was juss that bad buy beware don't read this."
2,A bit disapointed..,"I was really looking forward to this book when I ordered it. It seemed like an interesting peice of litreture. However, I found the writing in it really childish, and I also found myself trying to decipher the odd spellings and grammar in the book.At the end of the book, I was left wondering what the moral, lesson, or message was. The only thing I really picked up was that it was ""okay to be gay"", and even that theme didn't shine through strongly.I really felt this book lacked conclusion, as well as a theme.Though, I do not doubt that this book is fairly true to life..."
5,Terrific Read,"Truly an outstanding book. Having no real knowledge of the highly publicized Mumia Abu-Jamal case, the book provided real insight into what occured at his trial, conviction, and ongoing appeals. The author combined his comprehensive knowledge as Mumia's legal counsel with a true gift for the written word and the result was a book I could not put down."
5,Just plain great!,"This is one of the most authentically written YA novels I have ever read. While I believe Nancy Garden has done more than any writer to include homosexual characters in YA lit, her novels always seem like they are written by someone trying to get in the mind of a teenager. Myracle manages to write a compelling story while really reflecting the attitudes of teens. The use of flashback is great. Unlike many authors, Myracle manages to write a gay character who is not guilt-ridden. She is filled with doubt and must come to terms with her sexuality, and what it has done to her friendship, but she never worries that she is mentally ill or otherwise disturbed. This was a great read!"
4,Really cute and engaging,"I find Kissing Kate to be a pretty cute yet realistic coming of age story. I related to the main character, Lissa, a lot throughout the story. It's a pretty short novel and I read it in two days, but I was captivated by the plot and writing. The secondary characters are great, too. There isn't that happy ending that so many people long for here, so it makes the book more realistic to me. Don't get me wrong, I love a happy ending like the next person, but I get a little sick of it when I read it all the time. Life doesn't work that way. I wish I had read this novel earlier, I think it would have helped me a lot with my own sexuality. Lauren Myracle is a great writer."
4,Kissing Kate,"In my opinion Lissa is a well-natured teenager, seeeking constamtly for a friend. Kissing Kate is a very good book.I gave it a four star rating because, it was very well writin but to me it feels as if something was missing. Kootoes to Lauren Myracle for writingone of my top, favorite books. Read mybook blog. And enjoy Kissing Kate."
2,meh,"I was prepared to love this -- I love YA books, especially LGBT ones -- but it left me cold. For the most part, it's the story of a girl getting over her first love. Her best friend has dumped her after a confusing kiss. But because the confusing kiss and the entire relationship with the friend happen before the start of the book (we only see brief moments in the odd flashback), it's hard to get invested in the relationship, or to see what was so great about it, so the main character's sadness doesn't pack the necessary emotional wallop. The overall feeling of the book is one of unceasing gloom, lacking the charming romance elements of ""Annie on My Mind"" or ""Rainbow Boys"" or even ""Boy Meets Boy"", or even the heartbreaking charming-romance-gone-badly of EM Forster's ""Maurice"" (the original growing-up-gay book!)"
3,A Little Romance,"Not what I expected. I am trying to think of someone to whom I could give it, definitely not a ""keeper"" for me."
4,A cute film,I enjoyed this film for several reasons but was pleasantly surprised to see the great footage of Venice at the end. We were just there 3 months ago so it was an pleasure to see the places we visited. My husband hasn't watched it yet but I'm going to place a bet with him to see if he can figure out who the little girl is. We have several films of Diane Lane. I don't think he will realize it is the same person.
5,A Romance to remember.,It was great.... I watched it with my husband and my eleven year old granddaughter and we all loved it... it is now her movie. It was truly adorable. Great performances by all and a great ending.
1,Very disappointed,"I normally really like Laurence Olivier but this movie is just plain stupid. The rude comments on the part of Natalie, friend of Lauren, are tacky and gross. We stopped watching this less than 1/2 way through - I kept waiting for it to get better but no such luck."
2,Wanted to like it...didn't.,It's too juvenile. For a younger audience perhaps or maybe in the day it came out it was more suited. I love a lot of these type of movies but this one let me down. It's on the pile to re-sell. Think bubble gum.
1,"For all the 5 star ratings, I was surprised at some of the content in this movie.","For all the 5 star ratings that this movie has, I was surprised by some of the content. The children drink and become drunk to celebrate a birthday, dance inappropriately, look at pornography, sneak into adult movies and comment on an explicit love scene and swear all the time. There are never any consequences shown for any of this behavior or other bad choices made by the children and the adults of the movie. Though the story line seems cute and innocent, this movie is not a good role model for children and not worthwhile for adults either."
5,An overlooked gem,"Diane Lane's first film, ""A Little Romance,"" came and went in 1979 with little fanfare. It deserves far more. Her role as a 12-year-old living with her wonderful stepfather, corporate executive Arthur Hill, and star-gazing, insufferable mother Sally Kellerman, is superb. Into Diane's life comes a 12-year-old French boy and a senior citizen played by Laurence Olivier. The mixture, including the ""legend"" of ""the Bridge of Sighs"" in Venice, will sweep the viewer away. At its best, a film will take the viewer away from his or her daily cares. Few do a better job than ""A Little Romance."""
5,This is a very nice family movie,"A Little Romance was Diane Lane's first movie ever, and she is superb! Of course, Laurence Olivier held this sweet romantic comedy of budding adolescent romance together. I purchased this movie for the scenes of Paris and Venice and got the bonus of a great action plot and beautiful music. This is a movie I will watch over again!"
2,A Little Romance,I found this movie to not be very engaging and therefore did not watch the whole thing.A Little Romance
5,My favorite movie,"The first time I saw this movie was in my English class my freshman year in high school. I was one of the few males in the class. The teacher made us watch it for an assignment. She turned off the lights and commenced to show the film. I loved it. The movie moved me. It is the first of few movies which evoked tears to run down my face. As the film ended and my teacher turned on the lights again, I felt embarrassed to be crying because of a movie, but delighted by what I had just seen. Over the years, I've seen it over 20 times and own a copy. It is the single most romantic movie I have ever seen."
5,awesome!,"Don't miss this movie.I fell in love with this film in the early 80's when they ran it on cable and I've been waiting anxiously for it to be released on DVD.This one is in my list of best movies of all time. Diane Lane and Thelonious Bernard are brilliant and as always, Lawrence Olivier is not to be missed."
4,Where are they all now?,"After ""A Little Romance,"" Thelonious Bernard (born 6 March 1964, as Bernard Giumelli) appeared briefly in 1981's ""Allons z'enfants (The Boy Soldier),"" a grim film about the military academies into which the French threw their kids to be cannon fodder. He then decided to quit acting and pursue his studies. When not publishing academic papers and leading professional conferences, he teaches dental prosthetics at the l'université de Nantes where he became a Dean in the School of Dentistry. He lives in the quaint French town of Orvault, outside Nantes where he and his wife raised their children.Lawrence Oliver was 72 when he made ""A Little Romance"" and went on to do 18 additional performances in film and TV. In 1989 he died of complications from a muscle disorder and a series of health problems.Lane, despite a tumultuous private life, continues to act in major films."
4,Disappointing,"I just purchased this pack. It appears to be outstanding in all respects except one.My Canon 40D with battery holder does not fit. I have tried several times to get it to fit, but have not yet figured out how to solve the problem.I would really like to make it work."
2,Review,"Book in good condition, however, after picking regular shipping I received the book the last possible day. The problem with this is that in a follow-up email the seller indicated that the last possible day I could expect the book would be a week later than what they had advertised on their amazon selling page. Don't think I will buy from this seller again."
5,Health and Beauty Book review,"This book gave me lots of ideas for natural pregnany remedies and healthy lifestyles cahnges. Especially helpful was the transition diet. If you're looking for a roadmap to being a vegetarian or changing to a more organic diet, this is very helpful."
4,Chock full of useful health & beauty information.,"Especially relevant to those interested in the vegan lifestyle, Ms. Johnson, a supermodel, writes in a frank and entertaining manner. She shares her journey to her healthy lifestyle. Hers is an intelligent,thoughtful approach to all-round health...nutrition, exercise, diet, skin care & hair care, etc. Her in-depth nutritional information, well-researched & useful,covers a lot of ground. Not a new book, but one of the best of its kind."
3,"Liked, but didn't love it","Based on my previous experience with a Polly Horvath novel, I'd anticipated that this book would be a funny book. Not so, at least not in an uproariously hilarious way. Primrose finds that her parents have been lost at sea, but she never doubts they will return. In the meantime, she is sent to live with a bachelor uncle who wants to transform her town into an economic boom town. The parents do in fact return, against all odds, but most of the other loose ends just seem to drift off. Newbery Honor."
4,something different,"Unique book. Horvath finishes each chapter with a recipe for kids to make, and the ingredients tie in with the story. Example: ""I have hair the color of carrots in an apricot glaze (recipe to follow)..."" The main character has lost her parents but refuses to accept that they may be dead--a heavy subject, yet the book is a light, humorous read."
3,Everything On A Waffle,"I like this book, even though I like the book The Trolls better. An interesting person in this book was Miss Browzer. She was always helping Primrose out. Primrose is eleven years old and lives in a small town in Canada called Coal Harbour. Her parents went to sea on a stormy night and were thought to be dead. Primrose thought differently. She knew that they were on an island wondering how she was doing, because she knew that they loved her. Miss Perfidy was told to take care of Primrose. She got paid three dollars an hour. After Miss Perfidy stops taking care of her she hands her over to her uncle Jack's care. I thought that the recipes were very good, and the book was too!..."
3,A Kid's Review,The book I chose is everything on a waffle. I chose this book because it is a cool book to read. This book was about a girl losing her parents. Her parent left her with Miss Perfidy. Uncle Jack is in bad pain when he saved Miss Honeycutt. Then they find Primrose's parents. They told the whole story to Primrose. My favorite part of the book was when the parents came back. This was my favorite part because Primrose found her parents. I am recommending that you read this book because it has feeling.
5,Love it,"This book is highly amusing and funny! My famly is reading it aloud and is not yet done, but already love it!The story is about Primrose, who's parents disapeared at sea. Everyone thinks they're dead but Primrose. Her Uncle Jack, a realtor, now is her guardian. Although his heart is in the right place, he just isn't the best guardian. Other characters include the psychology-obsessed Miss. Honeycut- the British guidance counselor for Primrose's school, who has a crush on Uncle Jack. Then there's the owner of the restaurant in Primrose's hometown, Mrs Bowzer, who has her own opinion about everything. Other than that, see Ms Perfidy, an old woman who took care of Primrose the time before Uncle Jack came. The whole book is mostly about the FUNNY adventures of Primrose, who narrates the book with many comical comments on everyone's actions.If you want a good read, this is one!"
1,Superficial,"The fact that this book won a Newbery Honor award makes me wonder about the value of the Newbery rating system. The characters, while zany, were often unpleasant and only superficially drawn. The editor appears to have been asleep, given the many punctuation and grammatical errors throughout the book. The reference to alcohol was inappropriate in a children's book; and the burning of a guinea pig's fur was really not the sort of trauma I want inflicted on a child. Finally, the fact that the protagonist, an 11-year-old girl, loses part of a finger and part of a toe seems a bit gruesome for a book billed as an amusing piece of entertainment for young children. The death of one of the characters was only leavened by the fact that the reader never really comes to care about that character, or any other, for that matter. What a disappointment!"
5,The funniest book I have ever read,I think anyone who likes funy books will like this one it is so funny I almost laughed right out of my shoes. So don't just sit there order it before it is on back order.
5,Great book,"I really loved this book, but i didnt like how at the end of some of the chapters, it says something in 2 sentances that could have taken up a whole chapter. I would still recommend it though"
2,Everything On a Waffle summarized by C.G.,"i wouldn't recommend this book because it is really confusing in 65% of the story.I had to read it twice to understand most of it. For instance, at the beginning of the book it says thet she lives with her parents and then about a week later she lives with some old lady. It doesn't tell you why she moved until the middle, so you are kind of thrown off and confused through the whole beginning."
3,Okay...,"This was a pretty good book, but I feel as if it lied to me. On the back of this book it talks all about Melissa, Amanda, and Frank and how their parents leave to Paris. Unluckily, their babysitter is sick so they are sent to their Aunt Sally in Canada who lets them play with their jewlery and eats their green beans. She tells them stories of their relatives and of growing up on Vancouver Island. That's what the back says. When I read the book, I discovered it was not about this at all. It did not mention Melissa, Amanda, Frank, or Aunt Sally. It was about a girl named Primrose who although her parents disappeared into the sea, she believed they were still alive. Now where could they have gotten what it said on the back? Besides this confusion with the back cover, this still isn't my favorite book. It was pretty boring to me. If you liked this book, don't be insulted, but I was pretty disappointed."
3,O.K. but not great,"Being a fifth grade school teacher, I am constantly looking for the next great book. I eagerly anticipated the announcement of the Newbery Award this year and quickly read all of the honorees. None of them impressed me including this one. The set up of the story is unique but it did not capture my attention as I expected it to. The story is good, but not enough to make me pick it up and read it over and over. If you are looking for a book to keep you busy for a couple of hours, this is it. But it is not a book that you will go back to after a couple of years."
2,eccentricity rings a bit false,"Primrose is sure her parents haven't perished at sea, but still she's orphaned in a small fishing village in British Columbia. Quirky in language and character and loosely structured in plot, this story entertained me slightly, but wore thin after a while because I didn't feel much of a crisis for the main character despite her circumstances. I always knew her parents would return, and the zany grown-ups in her life after a while failed to entertain. The diction/vocab is a little older than the interest level of the story. So so, despite some book awards. ages 10+"
2,Nice book... No point,"This book was VERY boring. All it was about was a girl who loses her parents in some stupid boat accident and has to live with someone. Anyway, it is a very boring book with boring captions and jokes that weren't even funny. I put this book down when I was halfway through it. If your wondering if you should buy it, my answer is NO."
5,Gojira - Terra incognita,"The first time I saw the French band Gojira was as the opening band for In Flames , and I found the amazing . I have listened to all their CDs from then , and I have also seen their DVD . ""Terra incognita"" is my lastCD , but I think it was the first that they recorded . I highly recommend it . Their music is strong and agressive , with a great force in songs and also in lyrics , very compromised with the planet ."
2,Picture is totally wrong,"Amazon gets an F for putting the entirely wrong picture with this item. I thought I was getting tall glasses per the picture. They are squat, fairly large juice glasses. Know that the glasses are no more than 3 inches high. Nevertheless, they get two stars from me because Amazon ran them a few weeks ago for $6.45, not the current $14.99 price, and they are worth what I paid for them as juice glasses. They will also tolerate the dishwasher, which was another must for me. However, if you are wanting tall glasses, as I was, these are not them."
4,"Maybe not the BEST, but don't shy away because of price","Just picked this up (at a local store) as a back-up set for my Porter Cable kit which is running out of batteries and I'm not sure that I want to fork out the money for new 19.2v replacements! Anyway, I bought this set for less than 2 new PC batteries. Not expecting much, the quality of the Delta kit skocked me! The plastic is high grade, the blades mount easily (saws) with included hex wrenches, the drill is powerful and feels good, and overall I am quite impressed. I highly recommend this set to any home owner or light duty handyman. A couple of gripes: 1. you have to remove the battery from the drill to get it in the case (this is your most used tool folks) and 2. the kit should come with 3 batteries. I haven't seen extra batteries for sale yet so that might be an issue down the road. Overall very nice."
1,don't buy it,These tools are made in China and the batteries are no longer available ANYWHERE! So once your batteries die - you are done.If you want confirmation - go to any dewalt service store and they will tell you the same thing.
4,Great set of cordless tools for the casual user.,"Although it's made in Taiwan, the USA firm of Delta, of woodworking fame, has designed a set of relatively high quality cordless tools for the homeowner/casual user. They are not commercial grade. But have stood up to my weekend warrior abuse. All seem to have good torque and hefty feel, yielding accurate results.For the price, I'd choose it over competing Ryobi and Sears kits."
2,"Good tools, but the batteries are poor","I have two sets of these tools. I have used both sets for a couple of years and they work fine for the price. The drawback is that the batteries go bad after about a year and you can not find replacement batteries easily. When you do, they are around $100 each!! I have four total batteries and two of mine have gone bad (50%). Delta does not even list the tools on their web site and I have gone to many stores with battery in hand only to be disappointed that I can not find a replacement. I would recommend a tool set from a company that actually claims the tools on their site and offers replacement parts and batteries."
4,Great Buy!,"I just recieved this pack for christmas and for the price you can't go wrong. The only other combo packs in this price range are B&D, Ryobi, and some other ""house"" brands. The Drill is a comprable 18v gun, the trim saw seems to have ample power and the jig saw cuts fairly smooth for such a bargain priced set. The brad nailer was sort of disapointing at least when using the 1-1/4"" brads that came with it, I'm still not sure when I will find a use for a cordless palm sander. All in all the gun, saws, and the flash light are a great deal for under $300, the brad nailer and sander could have been left out and this set would still have been a very good buy. I haven't owned this set long enough to vouch for it's reliabilty but seeing how Delta and Porter Cable are one in the same I am fairly confident that I will enjoy this set for some time to come."
5,No more shameless copying!,"I was thoroughly impressed with the array of patterns, instructions and ideas for laying down new knotwork. If you are interested in creating, this is a great buy."
2,Objection,"Mr. Patterson is a new writer to me and he is a master craftsman of mysteries. I would love to read all he wrote, BUT I am offended by his use of four-letter words and sexual details. I don't need trashy language to enjoy a book. I will not be reading any more James Patterson mysteries."
2,2nd change,This book was O.k. but it seemed to take a longer time to get hear then the other stuff I've ordered....
4,Suspenseful And Thought Evoking,"Very good novel. Patterson's entire Women's Murder Club series is good enough that I am reading them a second time. Tho the writing is rushed and lacking in physical descriptions, the ladies of the murder club and their quirky personalities make you want to know more. I also like the fact that not everything goes well and perfect for the main heroines. They get shot, hurt, lose people they love, and feel fear. 2nd Chance brings back Lindsay, Cindy, Jill, and Claire to investigate some hate crimes against fellow police officers. Amidst the case evidence and stake outs, Lindsay deals with inner turmoil and conflict with her ""deadbeat dad."" Once again, the story focuses more on Lindsay than the other women, but the others are gradually playing stronger roles. I have honestly forgot what the third one entailed and am looking forward to reading it again."
4,has better stories than the the Cross series...........,ok i still prefer the Cross books..........but lately the Cross series is going downhill in terms of story.......but Women's Murder club has pretty good stories.........though unlike Cross series this books has 4 central characters......Cross stories has its own excitment and thrill........maybe in tht Department Murdel Club is a bit behind.....but over all the story is much better in the Murder CLub........2nd chance is a pretty good book......but i think the 1st was better..............
4,Same Formula as 1st to Die,"I had to give this book four stars, but only because it follows the EXACT same formula as the first book. The plot is still very exciting and the story grabs you. I made the mistake of reading one right after the other and it became too predictable to how the story was going to end. I would highly recommend this book, but not right after you've read the first one.In this novel you follow the Women's Murder Club again, but this time it is a serial sniper that is taking people out. There is a ""women's"" story intertwined, though not love this time, but there's a pregnancy and Lindsay is reunited with her dad. Patterson does a good job casting suspicion on certain characters to sidetrack you. The end will surprise the reader, but only as to who the killer actually is. You think you've caught him, but have you really? Same formula as the first one..."
1,LAST CHANCE,"Maybe readers should stop giving Patterson a second chance. This guy is a seriously bad writer, and I don't understand how anyone has given him more than one star. At least he has the guts to finally admit he has a ghostwriter, which he's probably had for the last ten books. His ghostwriter needs a ghostwriter. I took this one out of the library, but don't even bother to do that."
2,Far below Patterson standards,"While I have found Mr. Patterson's books to be extremely well written in the past, the 2nd Chance and Beach House have been poor by comparison.The plot here was so outrageous as to be not within the ranges of belief. Details were poorly connected. Substance was thin - sometimes transparent - sometimes just not connected.Whether his use of co-authors is the reason, as was also true with Beach House, (a different co-author),which also fell short, causes speculation about who is doing the writing.Very disappointing. Have probably bought my last Patterson book."
2,Not the best Patterson,I don;t see what all the good reviews were about this novel. The only good thing about the book was it was a quick read. Having read most of Patterson's book this seemed like simply a fulfillment book required by the publishers. For anyone that reads mystery's this was pretty shallow and somewhat predictable. I hope that his next book is better than this one.
3,Nice try but try harder,"I have read almost all of your books and have found them well written, however this one was far from it. The writing was sloppy, poorly researched and the dialogue intended to be cute, more often than not, wasn't. James, write solo. More is not always better. I also think your editor let you down. Take your time and let's have the old James back again and in rare form for your next book. Hey, no one wins all the time."
5,One of James Patterson's Best,"I have read all of Patterson's work, from Kiss the Girls, When the Wind Blows, to 1st to Die. All are good reads but this book, 2nd Chance, is a gem. Read the entire thing in a few days and wish I could read more. I look forward to more, more, more. Keep up the good work."
2,Patterson seems to be on a downhill slide,"I don't truly understand the 5 stars here on this book. Everyone has the right to their opinions, but come on people--let's get serious. I would certainly give Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider 5 stars, but not this. 1st to die was better than 2nd Chance and I really doubt I'll be coming back to this series. Bad dialogue, hardly any descriptions. It really seems that Patterson's work is suffering because he wants to get out as many novels as he can quickly. Many authors do this and it is a shame. And the Alex Cross series seems to be on a downhill slide as well."
2,Used to like the man,"I own almost all of the author's books in hardback version but after finally getting 1/2 way through this book I have decided that I will never buy another one of his books again. His heroine, Lindsay, smiles disgruntley too often for me. I think the other person listed as an author is the one who really wrote this book. Too bad, James Patterson, I was one of your best fans but I am going on to other and better and more original authors to collect their books, say, Christopher Moore, for example who wrote Blood Sucking Fiends and his latest, Lamb. Sad about this, but it is not a very good book and the words are too big on the page to make it look like you are getting something. Is he being paid by the weight of the book, or what?"
2,Definitely wait for the paperback,I will let the others review the plot and I will tackle the lack of words. I would not recommend spending money on the hardbound version. The author had chapters that were one and two pages long which means that words were only printed on half of the pages. The format actually interrupted the flow of the story.Any English teacher would give back a paper submitted like this and would ask the 300 odd pages to be condensed to 200 pages.Don't spend extra money on the hardbound book.
4,Riveting,Good murder mystery that keeps you guessing. Would have been perfect without the unnecessary cursing. MAY benefit to read the first book before this one.
2,Same as the First,"I ended up reading James Patterson much the same way Frederick became a pirate--a foolish misunderstanding between two alternatives one plausible (Richard North Patterson) and the other not (James Patterson), with the stupid protagonist (starring me in the role of Ruth) blithely taking the implausible path. Indeed, the book itself, not just this reader, shares certain characteristics with the Pirates of Penzance: an absurd plot, paper thin characters, and an air of humor surrounding all the proceedings. These traits are welcome in light opera. Much less so in a thriller.You are likely reading this review of this second-in-a-series book only if you have already read the first,1st to Die: A Novel. If so, you know exactly what to expect because this one is no better (and no worse). On the second go round, however, what was thin becomes threadbare. Despite starting by error, I decided to try another. After this one, though, I'm done. There are just too many better books out there."
2,"Thin plot, thin characters, thin writing.","This was my first James Patterson and it was a disappointment. The writing feels hurried and superficial and the characters have no depth. The plot starts promisingly but peters out and the subplots, if you can call the brief character ""study"" interludes that, don't contribute to the story at all. I am not sure if I'll pick up another Patterson. Maybe my mistake was diving into it after finishing a Tony Hillerman."
1,Too Easy to Figure Out,"This book was no surprise as far as thrillers are concerned. Once her dad popped up on the scene it was clear as day why he was there without any lengthy explanation.I hope he gives up writing from a woman's point of view. Not even close. Jill announces she's going to have a baby while drinking with the girls in a bar? And later, intelligent Jill, pregnant, takes a fake beer to drink? Does not happen (water is choice here).Phone battery dead, no backup, no telling anyone? Lieutenant? Way too sloppy for me."
4,A delightful ride,"I may be a novice at guessing the endings to this type of book but this one really kept my attention. I enjoyed the camraderie among the women and found it realistic. The book, with its many twists and turns, was a delightful ride."
3,ok ......,"I must agree with almost everyone else that this was not up to James Patterson's norm. I usually like to short chapters because it makes it easier to break away but mid way through the book it really started to irritate me, is he trying to break a record for most chapters in a novel????This did not have the same suspense as '1st to die', I certainly hope the next is better or I may start putting my name on the library waiting list."
2,Who REALLY wrote this book?,"2nd Chance w/ Andrew Gross. I would say that Mr. Patterson should be grossly embarrassed. ""1st To Die"" is pretty much up to Patterson standard. This (2nd Chance)is several levels below that standard. Example - what good writer uses the worn out ""I had no choice but to ---"" in sequential paragraghs! That was just one example of many that just rubbed me the wrong way, took me away from the story. Sophomoric writing. I finished only because I am a compulsive reader. A high school freshman might enjoy this."
4,Womens' Murder Club Revisited,"James Patterson's ""2nd Chance"" is the second in his series featuring the Womens' Murder Club. This sequel reads quickly, as do all Patterson's books, but lacks the ""on the edge of your seat"" quality that readers experienced in ""First to Die."" This book seems to be more involved with the development of the characters comprising the story rather than the plot itself. The book was enjoyable, just not as ""thrilling."""
2,Second Chance,"This second book of the Women's Murder Club series was a disappointment. There are contrived situations, as when the ""brilliant"" super-sleuth protagonist finds herself in a life-and-death situation, self-imposed, with a dead cell phone. Also, the relationship with her father is too pat and too undeveloped for him to move in with her. In addition, the ending is strange, an attempt on the part of the author to make sure you haven't guessed who the villain is.The language is abominable and unbelievable. Every character has a plentiful supply of vulgarity, and each has no regard for the person spoken to. It is NOT believable that a high public official would swear like a sailor to a woman he has never met before! Gratuitous use of the F word."
2,i didnt like this book..,"I did not like this book, James Patterson wote a terrible mystery. Lindsey is not a very good detective. Whenever the killers number shows up on claires caller ID, no one thinks about looking at it. Things like this made me not like the book at all. Whenever i found out who the murdere was i didnt realy care to read anymore. Why would a women chase after a murderer without backup or anything at all? ok pointless...."
4,"It Was OK, Kind of a Let Down......","This book, while a good read, lacked the excitement of 1st to Die. It did bring back most of the characters from the first book, but I didn't enjoy it as much as 1st to Die. To me, it lacked the heart pounding, page turning drama. I did LOVE the surprise at the end. It is still worth the read and most James Patterson fans will not be terribly disappointed....."
3,2nd better than 1st.,"I really liked this one because the action and excitment was right there from the beginning and Patterson again keep me guessing right to the end. This is a fast read which doesn't require a lot of concentration, but it kept drawing me back to see what happens next. Men, don't let the fact that this about ""A Women's Murder Club"" keep you away because Detectives Jacobi and Cappy are always there to back up Lt. Lindsey Boxer. Also Lindsey's Dad, Marty Boxer, comes back from her past to help her in to solve this murder series."
2,A sequel... an average sequel,"I like Patterson's work. I really enjoyed ""1st to die"". It was well written, with a great plot and real thrills... So I read ""2nd chance"". PLEASE! What is this? The beginning is good, there is a real pleasure to retrieve the women's murder club... But very soon, it's starting to go deeper and deeper into stereotypes. Very interesting aspects are left without development, the plot is as predictable as a Columbo episode, but at least the Columbo character is interesting...This book is not very bad, but I was very deceived of a such low quality after ""1st to die""... Plus the end that seems to have been written because the book had to fit inside a determined number of pages... Hey James, if you do a sequel, respect your readers: do it right!"
2,Should have borrowed it from the library,"I enjoyed the complexity of the plot in 2nd Chance. The story unrolled at a good clip. But the characters seemed flat, shallow. I remember them being more developed in the first book of the series. At some points, I couldn't figure out which woman was narrating the story-- they all had hair that stood on end, heats that raced and pounded, intuitions that spoke to them, in exactly the same way. I'm not one to set aside a book midway; the only reason I finished this is to see what happened in the end. I think I'll pass on the rest of the series."
4,Balanced,"Picked this up for another trip to Europe and eagerly finished it. I continue to enjoy the interplay of the four women. I do wish that Jill's character was developed just a little more. There were a few pieces that even after finishing confuse me, but perhaps that's part of the mystery. I'm curious to see if the Aaron Winslow character continues in the series."
2,typical soap opera,"Well now all the women (who seemed self reliant in the first book) are now going to have find the man of their dreams (Lindsey just had hers killed off in the previous book so she will have to wait another one or two books) marry them and produce children, because what else is there for women to do with their lives. The main characters in this book are supposed to be smart, sassy and successful but I felt like this was ""Days of our Lives"". It was a nauseating and wimpy read. Patterson now seems to be afraid of the strong women he created in the first book!Who is Andrew Grossman anyway?"
3,Great book,Another great women's murder club. Suspense and a couple of surprises keep the reader engaged. Patterson and Gross are two of my favorites.
4,Awesome,I love the story line of the books already..have already started 3rd Degree..and look forward to all the rest! Thsnks James Patterson..you are AWESOME!
2,Patterson's Soap Opera,"If you like Soap Operas, you might like this book. After James Patterson's previous works, I was expecting a nail-biter that I couldn't wait to continue. However, after listening to just one tape, I looked at the box (for the first time - my mistake) and saw that it was a selection of the Women's Murder Club. I had already guessed that this book was written for the female audience, based on the style. Still, I waited for the book to hook me, and was delighted by the parts narrated artfully by Jeremy Piven. Unfortunately, I became even more aware of the painfully condescending narration by Melissa Leo. Imagine a mother reading a Pooh book to her very young child - that is the style of this narrator. The story never worked, regardless of the delivery. Both stars are for Piven - lets hope that he does more of these."
2,too many plugs for the previous book,"My biggest complaint is that the author could not write more than two consecutive pages without plugging the previous book. At least I assume that that is what all the references to the ""bride and groom case"" were about. Second, the connections between the murders were quite far-fetched. It is unbelievable that anyone would have made those connections."
5,Bring On Nimber Three!,"A series of racially-charged murders puts San Fransisco on a powder keg. Who is doing it and why? Enter Lt. Lindsay Boxer, a crack homicide detective, and her Women's Murder Club, a collection of brilliant friends who are determined to crack the case.Although the second in a series by a series-oriented author, ""2nd Chance"" is fresh. The reader must contemplate a number of clues with no clear idea as to were the story is going. James Patterson slowly peels a delicious onion of intrigue. He also strikes a good balance, bringing out each of the Murder Club characters. However, the story belongs to the recently promoted Lt. Boxer, who combines brains, passion, vulnerability and a relentless determination when tracking the killer.""Second Chance"" was a pleasant surprise. I look forward to number three!"
3,mediocre,This is a mediocre mystery compared to the first women's murder club story. Some of the other members of the club are totally useless in this story. Fast-paced though and plot is tolerable. Kudos to Patterson for at least giving us a truly unpredictable ending!
4,2nd Chance,"This is the 2nd book I read by James Patterson. It's good but it's not better than 1st To Die. It's about this man going around killing African American people with guns. Lindsay, Jill, Cindy, Claire are trying to find who it was. But they are lucky to have a 2nd Chance. And even in this book. 1 of the characters is pregnent. This book is good. I recommend this book to everyone. If 3rd Degree be good, I know that 4th Of July will be good to."
3,Love em!,"I adore the Women's Murder Club series. The reason I'm not giving it a 5 is because the plot is very similar in this book and the others of this series. In great Patterson fashion, you wont figure out the protagonist until he wants you to but a little plot change up would be welcome. He writes quite a few books for his readers but I prefer quality over quantity. He's still a great author."
4,True Patterson Read,Great read in true Patterson form. Lyndsay Boxer keeps you turning the pages in the Women's Murderer Club. Just wondering what kind of trouble Jackobi and the WMC 4 can get into next is a joy. Looking forward to 3.
4,STRONG PLOT - FILLED WITH SUSPENSE,"Those who read ""1st To Die"" will want to follow up by reading ""2nd Chance."" Actually, ""2nd Chance"" is packed with a lot more suspense, power and punch than the book where we first encountered the Women's Murder Club. While the plot in this particular book was superb and the overall thrill lasted from start to finish, I found the characters stood well alone, but placed together in the ""Murder Club"", they came across as immature, over-zealous teenagers. The dialogue and actions were just a little too unrealistic and child-like to carry much weight. The book did live up to expectations when it came time to deliver riveting, edge-of-you-seat suspense; however, I do wish Patterson would come back to the Alex Cross series. Fans of the Cross series are patiently and avidly waiting for his return."
1,Same Old Patterson,"Same Old Patterson. Sorry I tried to read one more of his books. As usual, his characters lack substance. The don't become real to the reader. Patterson writes very superficial books: shallow characters, stereotypical villian, catering to ""political correctness."" Very easy to ID the real villian in the book once you were introduced to him.....how many times before have we seen this ""perp"" in movies or other books? The anger that he assigns to his characters is out of place and doesn't lead to productive thinking or enjoyable reading. His characters are so plastic that when they express this all-consuming anger it just exposes the poor job of character creation that much more. His lead character just becomes another hyped-up, profanity riddled, ""new"" woman as created by Hollywood. No more Patterson for me."
2,Not better the second time around,"James Patterson is one of my favorite authors. This book, however, was dull and predictable. The wonderful character development that occured in the first book of the ""women's murder club"" series, came to a dead end in 2nd Chance. The attempt of a romantic flare (common in Patterson novels) fell flat, and there was no dramatic BIG ending. I hope the 3rd one picks up!"
1,Give Me a Break,"This was my first James Patterson and it may very well be my last. What an inaccurate view of a female cop. Dead cell phones...no radio system...no backup again and again. In real life, she'd have been dead or on leave pending investigation. Reckless behavior. Intuitive hunches. More like a loose cannon that got very lucky. One of the other reviews talked about gun inaccuracies. I think the biggest inaccuracy was bad police procedure. So bad it wasn't believable. I listened to all the tapes in the book, but I won't look for another James Patterson."
5,2nd Chance (Women's Murder Club),Enjoyed the thriller to the very end. Great story!Easy to follow. Keep me guessing until the end.
1,Poor read,"This was a bad read. It was so much the worse becuase I appreciate the author's potential. I usually enjoy Mr. Paterson's work, but this one will have me second guessing the decision to purchase another by him."
2,Disappointed work,"This book is disappointing at all. I have read several books from JP and enjoyed some, or many, of them. This one is too slow-paced and with no surprise at all. Alex Cross series is much more interesting. Don't try this one if JP is new to you. Or, borrow it from library like me. Invest your money on other books from JP."
5,big fan of the murder club,I really like the pace of Pattersons books; however i am slightly losing interest in the alex cross series. The womens murder club is good. i like the different experiences and talents of the woman and how they work together. This book was very hard to put down and a very quick read.
3,Poor Marks on Marksmanship,"More than once, James Patterson had Lindsay Boxer ""take her Glock off safety."" He also had Chemera ""put a full clip"" into a 38 revolver. There needed to be a technical editor who is familar with firearms assist Mr. Patterson. A Glock has an integrated safety in the trigger and a revolver does not use a clip."
2,Not up to snuff,"Another of the Murder Club series. Four women, A police lieutenant, the Medical Examiner, a news reporter and the DA reunite to help Lt. Lindsay solve her latest case. A serial murder is killing victims related to San Francisco cops. The case gets really sticky when it appears the one of the Murder Club members may be a target as well. Lindsay has a reunion with her long departed dad and finds herself drawn again into his sphere of influence.Not a very good read although there is a nice twist at the end. With 4 protagonists the focus gets a little defused and the story limps a bit."
3,Almost There but...,"Though exciting with a good twist at the end, this book just does not rise to the level that ""1st To Die"" created. Perhaps more realistic but I was anxious to finish only because I wanted to just find out what happened and move on to my next book. I hope more in this series come out but try ""1st to Die"" and skip this one."
3,Fun and Inane,"Can't help myself -- I like Lindsay Boxer and the fast-moving plot. The conversations between the 4 women are either sickeningly cloying, too masculine or just plain ridiculous. I agree with the reviwer who said the characters were obviously written from a man's point of view. I just skip the contrived woman stuff and enjoy the mystery."
3,"Typicial Patterson.....Fast paced, cop finds the killer....","Good, enjoyable and a very fast read....Not as many twists and turns as his earlier and better works, but fun anyway...."
3,Who wrote this???,"I was overcome with the feeling that I was reading someone else's writing - not James Patterson. Sure it had his quick, choppy style - but it felt forced - edited to fit the style. In fact, at times it seemed that essential parts were simply chopped away to allow for short, quick chapters.That said,anyone from Long island will love the setting and east end mentions."
4,Great book,I loved reading the book. It held my attention from the start and kept it throughout the entire book. It is very fast paced and leaves out a lot of unnecessary fluff that most other books throw in. Great book. I knocked Down one star because of all the swearing that I did not appreciate.
3,a great series so far!!,anything james patterson writes is great. i really enjoy getting to know his characters.the action & adventure keep me reading
5,Bought these as a Christmas gift,"Bought a bunch of these James Patterson books for my sister last year for Christmas and she enjoys them. As long as she does, I can write the review saying so."
5,2nd chance,I chose this book because I love James Patterson books. Once I start I can't put the book down. Great author.
5,Kindle fire version,Kindle fire version. Very quick download even for the slow internet i Afghanistan. Very pleased with the service. No issues
1,"A fraud, in a creative sense.","James Patterson has developed a ""cookie cutter"" formula for churning out low quality novels. It appears that he partners with others who write the books, then he markets them with his well known brand name. For some time I have put up with this mediocrity. No more. I'm done. Just my opinion, folks, but a well deserved one."
3,Lots of twists and turns in this mystery,"Lots of twists and turns in this mystery. Patterson weaves a tight and intricate tale. Fun weekend read...but keep those brain cells active -- the plotline is thick, and the clues, tough ones."
4,Great characters,"I am enjoying the ladies ""smarts"" , though they do drink a lot. I don't know Iif I would like to live in SF with all the serial crime.The plot really twists and turns to keep my interest"
4,Can't wait to read the next one.,"Very well written, I am looking forward to reading the entire series. James Patterson is one of my favorite authors."
4,Speedy but solid thriller!!,"The second installment of James Patterson's Women's Murder Club holds up really well. While the series title is very hokey and at times Patterson's dialogue is as well, the plot is nice and tight. The suspense is ratcheted pretty high as each members of the club have to deal with life and death matters. While I really enjoy Lindsay Boxer the book is supposed to be about all four of the women so I would like to read more about the other three ladies. Overall, this was a good book that was a quick read but very enjoyable!"
3,"Money, money, money","This is a huge effort to capitalize on the Patterson name. I think he should be a bit more particular about what product will have his name stamped on it. This is a truly simplistic novel with little ""meat"" for the readers to sink their teeth into. Although this is fiction, I wish there was a bit more attention to the believeability factor. This is a very easy read and only moderately entertaining."
3,Go to beach. Read book,"This second book in the Women's Murder Club reads just as quickly as the first. A reader gets sucked in, but not bogged down. Chapters are short, proofreading was not a priority, but the plot is cohesive. If you're not looking for more than that, this will wet your whistle."
4,Gripping,"I certainly enjoyed the story line. It was believable and fast moving and easily kept me turning the pages.I do have a slight problem with 'The Women's Murder Club' though. It just seems so girlie and childish...the kind of 'adventurous gang' that I was reading about before I was ten! The characters; Lindsay, Claire, Cindy and Jill are all good characters but they'd be more believable without the title 'Women's Murder Club'.Lindsay's reunion with her dad was nicely done and woven into the story well. The ending was okay but I felt that maybe the 'pre-twist' ending would have tidied the story up well anyway..and maybe better.Still worth four stars for a good page turner."
3,Good But Not Great,"2nd Chance is a good book but it doesn't even compete with some of his other books like 1st to Die and Mary Mary. It was very suspenseful and it was defiantly a page turner. But there were a few things I didn't like about it. One thing was I didn't like how the girls just became ""best friends."" Friendships take time and you do not become that good of friends with someone in only a couple of months. Also I found Jill's miscarriage to be completely pointless and irrelevant. I am not even sure why James Patterson even put it in the book at all. It wasn't like that was a main concern of the last book or anything. It just kind of seemed like an incomplete thought that he just decided to throw into the book to take up some room. Also I know that James Patterson is know for his plot twists at the end of his books but this one seemed very unnecessary. I liked the first ending more than I liked the ""real"" ending just as a couple of other reviews said."
2,"No, thank you","This is a feminist novel through and through. I `ve never aspired to be one and anyone who is makes me very irritable. Get off your man hating horse, ladies. Story is not bad but female circle thing ruins it for me completely."
3,Not Bad... Not Great,"When a little girl is shot on the steps of a San Francisco church, Detective Lindsay Boxer knows it's time to reconvene the Women's Murder Club. Boxer and her friends think the killer may be an ex-cop, but nothing can prepare them for the demented logic behind his choice of victims.After listening to 1st To Die, I was hooked and couldn't wait for the second installment. Naturally, sequels of any kind are never as good as the first. While the first one was a first rate thriller, this one didn't really keep me hooked and wanting more."
4,A good read,"Not great, but good. I enjoy Patterson's books, but I can't say I wait for his next publication on tenter hooks -- like I do with Dennis Lehane and Michael Connolly."
2,Threadbare and cloying,"After a month spent reading all of John Sandford's ""Prey"" novels,I found the plot and dialogue of 2nd Chance threadbare and Ihungered for something more substantial. I was also annoyed bythe unreal emotional relationships among the four women friends."
2,"She's supposed to be a bright cop, but she does dumb things ...","just to make the plot work. Not very realistic. If you want a realist cop character, try Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch."
2,Some shoot the editor!,"I was cringing while reading this. The dedication is to a physician (one must assume a medical examiner) and, were I in her shoes, I'd ask to be removed from the dedication. The medical examiner in the book states that she did a residency in dermpath. Nope. No can do. There is no residency in DERMpath, only a one year fellowship following a four (or five) year straight pathology residency. (And the ME doesn't even mention her forensic fellowship.) Secondly, Lindsay and the medical examiner refer to a person as being hung (suicide, folks). Pictures are hung, people are hanged. How much did they pay this editor for not doing his/her job...??? It's insulting to the reader."
3,Getting better,"A vast improvement on 1st to Die, I couldn't put it down, we are slowly getting to know the characters, building snippet by snippet, yes I guessed ""who done it"" but it didn't matter, looking forward to ""3rd to ??????""."
1,Save your money!,"I bought the audio tape. Save your money! Not only is the plot predictable, it is unbelievable.(Policewoman who is investigating a ""monster"" chases him with no backup/ dead cell phone (obviously no car charger) then takes on 6 guys.)Also, readers were bad! Female reader pronounced the opera Aida (eyeeeeda) aaaaadeeeah! Male reader trying to sound threatening sounded like a high school kid.This was my first Patterson - I guess I haven't missed anything!"
4,U will get a 2nd chance to buy it but u should do so now,You should read 1st to die first to get acquainted with Lindsay Boxer and the Women's Murder Club before starting on this one. In this book the killer is murdering victims who are extremely close to police officers.Lindsay also has to struggle with issues with her father in this one. Maybe he's the killer? This isn't as good as 1st Chance but still is a good read.
2,not well done,"Another of the Murder Club books. Four women, a police lieutenant, the Medical Examiner, a news reporter and the DA reunite to help Lt. Lindsay solve her latest case. A serial murder is killing victims related to San Francisco cops. The case gets really sticky when it appears the one of the Murder Club members may be a target as well. Lindsay has a reunion with her long departed dad and finds herself drawn again into his sphere of influence.Not a very good read although there is a nice twist at the end. With 4 protagonists the focus gets a little fuzzy and the story limps."
2,He has lost his touch,"Roses Are Red/Violets Are Blue/ and ,""Second Chance,"" have lost their luster! I am a fan of Mr. Patterson! When I first started to read his books I couldnt put them down. The characters were so well written and I really got caught up in the plots. When I read ,""Kiss The Girls,"" I was scared out of my wits. It was a philosophical suspense tale and a profound, contemporary novel.I don't really care about these four ""Murder Club Members."" They have absolutely no appeal .There is no scene building in these last books of Mr. Patterson. He has lost his touch and his last books, this one included, is not brilliantly executed!"
5,Another winner!,I read this book in less than a day. I really like the Womens Murder Club. I thought I had this one figured out about half way through but was surprised at the outcome. I hope the Murder Club gets together again real soon!!
4,2nd Chance,"To me it was simple writing, but this was my first James Patterson novel that a friend gave to me for my birthday. At first I thought that this was going to be just another mystery which you think that this person is the killer.No that was not the case with this book, at first I got pissed because his chapters were only three pages long at the most, I was used to reading like 50 page chapters from the likes of Stephen King and Tom Clancy.But 2nd Chance was a good novel, not great, but it was good."
2,Last Chance,"The first meeting of the murder club, was different from A. Cross, but fast and enjoyable. This one doesn't make sense even in San Francisco, there are times when the group can find clues where none exists and at other times can't figure how to pick up a suspect that is a parole violator. I realize Mr. Patterson had a coauthor on this book, it seems the ""co"" did most the authoring."
2,Disappointed,"I was not happy with this book. In fact, I was so disappointed I am not reading anymore of his work, although I have read many of his books. The Women's Murder Club, silly in the first book, is even less believable in this one. The writing is is stilted, and full of cliches. I don't think Mr. Patterson should make his main characters be women, as he doesn't really think like one. I finished the book because I wanted to see who the real killer was, but I suffered through it. Lindsey seems very stupid to me, not some super cop like Patterson wants her to be. I think in the next book Lindsey should get killed by the dangerous suspect when she follows him with no back-up. Now that would be a twist we wouldn't expect!"
4,Great book!,"This was a great 2nd book, better than the first in the series. The characters were developed further, and so were their relationships to each other. And, all that was in the background of a fantastic mystery with tons of twists and turns.Patterson really leads the readers (and the characters) through mazes that seem to never end. And, when you finally do get to the end, you are led through one final twist that is sure to delight the reader. Great effort!I read the book in one sitting, not able to put it down.Read it - even if you missed the first in the series - it doesn't disappoint."
5,2nd Chance (Wonen's Murder Club,I love the way James Patterson writes. He doesn't draw thing's out where you lose interest. He keeps you guessing and I like that. My wife reads all his books.
4,Enjoyable reading,I'm addicted to James Patterson. I'm enjoying this series. Can't wait to get to the next book. I have a hard time putting his books down.
2,Teresa,Barbie Teresa Butterfly Art Doll (1998)I had her when I was a Girl and can't wait to get her back againshe is beautiful and I like her a lot
1,Not what is pictured,"The reason I bought this item is that it looks like it comes with the rubber dust boot on the rod.It does not, although it appears in the product photo. The boot is an extra 15.00$ at the auto store.I guess they think you will keep it and but the boot instead of returning. Dishonest."
5,Mr.Bunny,"I have to hurry up and buy 2 of these quick. My son has had one since he was born. It was mine and he took it, lol. He is now turning 4 next week, and just lost it today at school. It is very soft and very durable to withstand millions of washes in the washing machine, and the way a birth to 4 year old child handles it. It is his security bunny. He takes it everywhere and sleeps with him every night. When he is sick Mr.Bunny helps him feel better. It was actually given to me by my Grandmother a month before she passed. This is definitely something a child can love forever and help them feel safe. But, don't everybody buy it yet, I need to figure out how to get the money quickly to buy it, and maybe two so I have a backup."
4,iPod adapter,The cable works as advertised. I haven't had any problems with it so far. Colored tips made for an easy install
4,It works with my Panasonic DVD player and Video Ipod,"I took a chance on this and it turned out well! I have an Ipod, one of the video capable ones. The screen on it is frankly too small for extended viewing. I also own a Panasonic DVD player with an 8.5"" screen. It works great and has wonderful battery life.So I came here looking to see if I could find a solution to mate my Ipod to my DVD player. As you may know, you can purchase movies, TV progams episodes from itunes fairly reasonably.I noticed that this cable had what look liked the same connectors as my DVD player had on its side. Turns out it works! The only cable you don't use is the USB cable. It just sits free. My guess is if you plug it into a computer, it may help with keeping the Ipod charged. But my idea was to use it on trips and long plane rides.So it was a good purchase. The cables looks sturdy and well made, only drawback is when in use the cables take up more room than the the two units.Hope this helps."
2,Kenwood's Decks are Picky with iPod Video,"This works well for everything except viewing videos from your iPod. For some reason I can only do that with the Kenwood Cable. With this one, it never worked. As long as you don't view videos on your deck from your iPod, you'll be fine with this."
4,Pittsburgh Steeler Car Mat,The car mats are good quality and very nicely made.The only complaint I have is we cannot get they to keep laying straight in our car or truck.
1,I'm sure this is going to be a great product...when it arrives.,"I ordered this product on 19th August 2009 as a present for a close family member. That was allowing a whole two weeks for the order to arrive on time. It is now the 14th September and I am still awaiting an estimated delivery date. The product has had the ""Usually ships within 3 to 5 days"" for that whole time. Evidently, this is not the case.Amazon customer service helped a lot: ""Our shipping estimates--such as ""Usually ships in 3 to 5 days ""--take into account the time it takes to receive the item from our suppliers, package it, and prepare it for shipment. We can't predict exactly how long it'll take to obtain it or when we'll be able to ship it.""Great. So how long am I realistically going to be waiting then? Maybe it'll arrive on time as a Christmas present.I have never had this problem on Amazon UK."
3,"Well, could be happier but I like them okay.","Initially the mats looked great!! But after a few days in the car, they started chafing. So these mats won't last long."
4,Good gift,The mats have nice tread on the back and stay in place. Good color on the front and appear to be easy to clean and maintain. My dad really liked them.
5,A romance for those who know dreams CAN come true.,"Rather than most romance novels, which usually stick to the same basic guidelines of mostly a very physical relationship, White uses mind play and games to give the reader a sense of fun and surprise. For anyone tired of the same old drivel, I highly recomend this book. Tiffany White's lead women are always strong and intelligent, and know how to get what they want! A Kiss in the Dark features a woman who has fallen for a gorgeous polo player who is both rich and well known. When he is temporarily blinded, she finds the opening she's been looking for. Sensuous mind play ensues, keeping the reader smiling, and anticipating every next move. A story well worth the read. It's a breath of fresh air for anyone who is tired of the same damsel in distress story line."
3,It doesn't stay dark for long.,"Back Cover description: Brittany Astor wanted three things: to be beautiful, to marry Ethan Moss and to own a cat. The rare, expensive Bengal kitten was a possibility. Which led to her unexpected encounter with to man of her dreams. To earn extra money, the struggling book editor answered an ad to read aloud. Her employer wasn't the sweet little old lady she'd imagined but nasty, sexy Ethan. Nor was the notorious playboy exactly what Brittany had been fantasizing about for years. Temporarily blinded, Ethan was hiding himself away from the world. For timid, plain Britt this was her chance to have a hot and torrid fling with Ethan. But what about when fantasy time was over?First, Brittany doesn't really come across as plain and timid. Second, she might be struggling, but not much. Third, some of the dialogue was erotic, but I think the author could have used something other than the school girl/principal theme. That's my objection and why I only gave it 3 stars."
1,no help at all,"I am interested in becoming a programming, but just don't know where to start. This book didn't give me much help. It focuses too narrowly on C++ and dismissed any others. There weren't enough resources in the appendix and the author did not give many online resources. The author wrote many programming books, and the only ones he suggested were his books."
4,"Almost, but not quite","Jesse Liberty has a very clear and informative style and most readers will gain a lot from this book. There is something of a bias towards C++, as this is the most popular commercial language, although there arguably should be a little more infomation on other languages that are used commercially, such as VisualBasic and COBOL. Information on online programming courses would be helpful, while I think that some of the books that Liberty recommends for further reading are a little technical for the target audience. Still, I think this book, along with Greg Perry's Teach Yourself Beginning Programming in 24 hours, and Wallace Wang's Dummies Guide to Programming, is definitely worth buying if you want to become a computer programmer."
4,Clear & Expert Guidance from a Veteran,"If you have any aspiration to become a computer programmer, this book will serve you well. They say wise men learn from other people's mistakes (i.e. experience). Why not learn from Jesse Liberty's 20 years of experience by reading this book?He covers all the major programming languages that you will likely consider in your quest for a programming career. Even if you have already decided on a specific programming language, it can only help to be familiar with the alternatives. The author covers all the platforms and technologies that a successful programmer will need to know.Mr. Liberty has provided a valuable service to aspiring computer programmers. Before you sign up with a search firm or step into your first interview (or even buy your first compiler), make sure you pick up some real-world advice by reading this book.Good luck!"
2,Book implies college CS students are idiots.,"Unfortunately Liberty comes across with a chip on his shoulder against formal college education in this book. Statements like some of the best programmers he knows are ""taxi drivers and psychologists"" and former university training mainly teaches students to operate ""mainframes"". In the Introduction it says ""According to a study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, by the year 2005 there will be over two million new jobs for software professionals!"" which fails to mention most of the jobs will be overseas easily outsourced as making tennis shoes. Otherwise, Liberty still shows his expertise and there are good sections on advice for interviewing and resume writing. But in the end as an idiot, I wished I had majored in engineering instead of computer science especially when 90% of my undergraduate computer science student body were graduate students from the eastern side of the world."
4,a thing of the past,"As much as I would like to become immersed in programming, the field is becoming obsolete. There are too many easier ways to program something like an HTML document than to write it out long-hand. Had I found this book/field five or even ten years ago I could be rich by now. Oh well! But the book itself isn't bad, it just needed to be more specific on the actual programming steps instead of pushing that off to other resources. This book is a ""How to learn about Programming"" instead of the actual programming steps. But for those points, it was very good."
5,Very Impressed with content,"I bought this book up after just barely glancing at it in the bookstore, and was not able to put it down for several days. Being of the Complete Idiot's Series - I was surprised at how ""readable"" it was. I am a soon to be graduating student in Computer Science and this book really brought together alot of things I have learned, and things that I have wondered about. It is very inspiring, very informative, and very honest about what I have heard/know of careers in Computer Programming. I highly recommend this enjoyable, informative, and entertaining book to read for anyone who might be interested in working in the field. Best of luck to you. I am going to go out there and pick up other books by this author!"
1,There is no content,"I went to read my newly purchased book, and I was quite disappointed to discover that there is a picure of the cover and nothing else. It is a $1 picture of the book's cover!"
5,Great movie,"This is a wonderful movie that really captures the pathos of being young in turbulent time. The movie is romantic without being sappy and trite. All in all, a moving and sensitive potrayal of first love and friendship.*There is a lot of cussing, but the way it's handled by Rose is pretty funny."
5,A True Gem!,I watched Dogfight at the Cinema when I was visiting San Francisco and I loved it. I would have to say my favourite River Phoenix film ever. Very emotional & touched me so much. Unfortunately I have only ever seen it for sale in the UK once & I had no money. When I returned days later it was gone. Shame American VHS does not work over here. I would love to have a copy.My search goes on.
4,Phoenix in macho role,"DOGFIGHT(1991) was not released theatrically outside the US, and Warner Bros. had only a limited release in the States. Maybe they were wrong, because the film enjoyed a cult even before River died in `93. It could have been a ""sleeper"". River Phoenix and Lili Taylor star as a most unlikely couple and they play with nuances seldom seen for actors their age... The film is on a quiet level and (maybe) more realistic than other more famous film (Full Metal Jacket, Platoon etc)... It is - with My Own Private Idaho - River Phoenix`finest hour as an actor..."
4,Very moving love story,"Touching, emotional, charming, funny, poignant, sad, endearing & ultimately very moving.Nice direction, good solid acting and an ending that simply leaves you to imagine the future for the 2 main characters. Not enough films do this in my opinion. Another plus is there is no heavy handed emotional musical score to this film, it is just played out naturally. Not enough films do this either.River Phoenix is good in this, but really this is Lili Taylor's film. Her character goes through a lot of emotions in this film & they are all superbly acted.The love scene is shown as awkward & fumbling which can be so true to life. Kudos to everyone involved in making the picture.I just hope Criterion get the rights to give this film a special edition it truly deserves."
4,River Phoenix in his prime.,"This movie is very simple, and unique. It's the kind of love story which you really believe in while you're watching because it doesn't feel phony. This can be credited to the acting, the situation, and the plot as well. This isn't about a man falling madly in love with a beautiful woman and then spending his life missing her. That's all been done, and that's what makes this film a breath of fresh air. River Phoenix shows why he is missed by so many, and really allows you to connect with his character. I recomend this to anyone who wants to see love put to true art, and be touched at the same time."
5,best freaken movie,I rented this movie because it was required for a class and I was expecting it to be boring and a waste of time...but I fell in love with the story and the characters I'm glad I watched it!!
5,BRILLIANT NANCY SAVOCA AS USUALL !!,"WHY IS'NT NANCY SAVOCA A MORE ACCLAIMED AND CRUCIAL DIRECTOR..JUST RENT HER 'TRUE LOVE AND DOGFIGHT FILMS...IF YOU CAN ,,,SHE IS AMAZING"
5,finally!,"This is one of my all time favorite sleepers. I have been waiting years now for this to come out on DVD. The beauty of this film is that, unlike common Hollywood fare, all the characters have depth. The love story between River Pheonix and Lili Taylor is sweet and moving, but in addition, you see the best and worst sides of the supporting characters. In the end, you are left with the sense of the individual dignity of each person, from the young soldiers to the young ladies they are conning into their game."
4,Good movie,I liked this movie and didn't care that i spent my money on it. It was well written and well acted and you could follow it even if you don't speak spanish.
5,Extremely interesting!,"I am very pleased that I purchased this video a while ago.I was most impressed with the way it is so well presented and indeed all the contents.Vladimir Ashkenazy is a renowned expert with "" Pictures at an Exhibition"". With his own deep knowledge he does the interpretation which he thinks is correct. You see him as a conductor both rehearsing and performing the work. He also does a live Barbican piano performance of the work in London ( there is magnificent piano playing in it). There are also other works he conducts and more bits from various piano recitals. It is all very well worth the money and I highly recommend it."
5,A MUST FOR ALL COLLECTORS OF 'PRESSED GLASS',"This is an absolutely wonderful book and a must for any glass collector. The book is factual, concise and worth every penny. The most impressive thing about this book are the pictures - they are clear!! They are in black and white and on good quality paper. Every single picture shows the pattern clearly and each pattern has pictures of several different pieces. There isn't a single pattern that isn't easily identifiable which can't be said for most such books."
2,Moderately interesting,"This book is useful for piano students, but not one of the best in the category. The content relates much to the method of analyzing scores for the purposes of understand structures, and aiding memorization. There are other sections as well, which are mildly more interesting. To get true and solid advice, go for Art of Piano Playing by Henrich Neuhaus."
4,Review of Piano Technique by Gieseking & Leimer,The work was well written but very formalized. It covered the material technical in depth and was particlary well organized.
2,For Advance Pianist,"The author of this book is expressing his method of piano playing or technique. ""The present treatise explains the method of my piano playing, that is, what I consider to be the foundation of my pianistic technique"". If you are an advance play or teacher you might find this 1932 book useful."
5,This Book is an Amazing fine!!!,"I don't care what the above reviewer's experience was with this book - I guess we're all different because God as my witness this book did it for me! Okay, so I agree the title is misleading, but this book allowed me for the first time to personally experience and know that my world is a mirror of my stuff and see the benefit I'd get out of doing the practically impossible for me, ""Course in Miracles."" Guys I'm telling you this book has made a real impact in my daily experience. This, my first review -- it's my tithe to the world. I had this book lying around for my house for about a year before I came across the negative review above and decided to peek into it one evening just to see how bad I got rip-off...Sweet Jesus, my eyes are open and now I can see."
5,This is a wonderfull reading experience!,"This was the first book of Father Greeley's I had ever read. That was over five years ago, and I read it at least once a year to remind me what marriage should be about. Father Greeley has an uncany sense of the need for growth and change within a family. This book always makes me want more from my own life"
4,Composition,I used this as a textbook for a rhetoric and composition class and found it to be relevant and useful.
3,"Ok read, offers some helpful advice","It seems that everyone ever in real estate decides to quit real estate and write books about real estate. While there are some useful moments in this book, it is another in a very long line of books rehashing basic real estate concepts.If you are purchasing this book for a novice, I would recommend it more highly than my rating."
2,Too limited in scope,"I didn't find this book very helpful. It has a lot of personal comments and one person's opinions on being a sales agent but there is no information about other real estate careers. To find out about other jobs like real estate appraisers and commercial real estate agents (where the big money is), look for the book called Real Estate Career Starter published by LearningExpress. It was much more comprehensive and included more helpful and specific info on real estate careers."
4,Awesome supplement to RE licensing course,"Once this book arrived in the mail, I could hardly put it down! I am currently taking the course, and was looking for some of the more specific details of the business that the course fails to teach. The author does an excellent job of separating his personal opinions, but still uses an honest approach to sharing his personal experience. Also, the text goes a little more in depth about agency - really helps as an aid to studying for the licensing course. This book doesn't lead a new agent to dangerously believe that he or she will make a lot of money in the first year - and actually tells you what will cause you to fail in your new career. Although I would have liked to see more information about careers in real estate besides simply being an agent, overall I must say this book is tremendously helpful to a new agent."
1,This book is garbage,"I bought this book hoping it would provide insight on commericial real estate, how to enter the business, the structure of the business etc. Instead, I found a superficial instruction that would for most people be regarded as common sense. For example the book expounds on guidelines used in choosing a company to work for or how to conduct one'self once employed. To me it is obvious to inquire about the perks of the various firms or agencies and compare them in order to find the most suiting job. I do not need to be told not to worry when I do not get an office when I am first starting out nor do I need to be told to stay organized or to otherwise act professional. THIS IS COMMON SENSE. It would be one thing if these didactic sugestions were accompanied by some sort of ensightful, helpful information. For this reason I find this book infurriating. Platitudes and otherwise banal commentary abound in this book."
5,Chinese cooking made easy!,"I am new to Chinese cooking. This cookbook offers many useful tips and information about the Chinese culture as well as the ingredients used in the recipes, which I found helpful. I've already tried the Moo Goo Gai Pan. I substituted dried shiitake mushrooms for the fresh. Also tried the Tangerine Beef. Both dishes were easy, quick & delicious!"
3,"Okay, but get it from the library","If it's been said before that this book is too ""Americanized,"" that may be true, but I'd suggest that this book doesn't go far enough -- even in that direction. While a ""fun"" book, the actual recipes themselves do not adequately cover a typical American-Chinese restaurant or takeout-menu; for example, Mongolian Beef and Sesame Chicken (two of the most popular dishes served, among others) are mysteriously and conspicuously missing from the book. The majority of the recipes will probably be unfamiliar. That's too bad, since it seems clearly aimed at someone who would want American takeout style Chinese cuisine. While Yan has a few good ideas here, there are far better books out there with more of what you're looking for."
2,Very Strange Book,"Some recipes are delicious, twice cooked pork with cabbage was, but some are vile, the horrid shrimp, cabbage, tofu and ham comes to mind. And the author tells how to make a red sauce and then has no recipes for the sauce. If you get the book, read each recipe carefully and think how it will probably taste; you will most often be right."
3,Not authentic enough,"Overall, this book offers a quick overview of Chinese cuisine, specifically one of many provinces, Canton. However, as a Chinese, I have tried many of the recipes in this book and found that the directions were too complicated to follow, especially preparing for the sauces. And after half an hour to 45 minutes of long arduous preparation, I find that the dishes were less than palatable and authentic. I would say if you like Americanized Chinese foods, go right ahead and try it. The Lemon Chicken dish is recommended. However, if you are looking for more authenticity and sophistication, try other ones."
2,"An ""ok"" book","If you're looking for simple to cook chinese dishes, this is it. But if you're looking for ""tasty"" chinese dishes, please look elsewhere. This book offers dishes that are typical of the those the author prepares on his TV shows, but nothing really new. It's an ok book for beginners and for those who want to learn more about the history of cooking. But as far as your taste buds and tummy are concerned, there's nothing extraordinary."
4,"Good tools, weak batteries","These are very good quality tools, like all Hitachi that I own (more than 20) they are built to last. The light on the circular saw is a great extra, even when cutting something in poor light the light on the saw is perfectly located. The drill is only a 3/8"" chuck, but has lots of power. The only problem I find with this combo is that the batteries that came with it are 1.2 AH. I got lucky and found a couple of 18 volt Hitachi 3.0 AH batteries at Lowes on clearance for 40 bucks each. With these batteries the tools have more power and run much longer on a charge. Even with the added expense of upgrading the batteries, these tools are worth it to me as they don't have to go back to the service center all the time like some of my DeWalt and Porter Cable tools do."
2,Decent tools but horrible battery life,"I am in the home remodelling business and purchased this combi set primarily for the circular and recip saws. I figured for small, quick cuts the saws would come in handy. The tools are of decent quality and have a nice feel to them when in use. The problem are the batteries not being able to keep a charge. I followed the instructions regarding initial charging procedures and I am lucky if I get a few minutes use out of each charge. (This also includes the cordless drill). I own two other Hitachi saws that I love (corded of course). Despite the fact that this product is made in China, the batteries should be of much better quality. Most of Craftsman's professional line is made in China and Porter Cable is made in Taiwan. This set is basically a waste of money for the professional or DIY'er for that matter."
1,Forever Awful Freeze-dried Mac and Cheese,"A poor quality freeze-dried food product from AlpineAire.... cute product name, but this is remarkably bad for freeze-dried food. I rarely can carry enough food when hiking in for 3-4 days wearing packs. I brought two of this product, ate one, and went hungry rather than eat the other.Taste is similar to retail store budget macaroni and cheese, but without the milk and butter/margarine to be added as part of the preparation instructions for the boxed stuff. The sodium content is at least double the already salty boxed product, and costs approx 400% more. Only virtue, of course, is the durable packaging and fast cook noodles. But there are other freeze dried food brands that offer mac and cheese with better taste and better nutrition, for similar cost."
3,Strike of the Cobra Unspectacular But Solid,"In the same vein as Tom Clancy, Stephen Coonts, et al, Timothy Rizzi creates a viable, if a little far-fetched, technothriller scenario...Though stock characters populate this book, Rizzi does a fine job with the technical end, especially the aerial dogfighting and the covert ground ops...The last hundred pages dragged a little, but again, that's forgivable, because suspense and action are so hard to sustain over almost 500 pages...There's nothing spectacular here, but die-hard technothriller fans will find solid, honest reading..."
3,Interesting,"Interesting article in a way, but I have fleshed out these issues much more thoroughly in a recent article written to clear up a lot of confusion. Now available on the Masonic Music site, under Mozart: A Resolution of Mozart and Freemasonry: Enlightenment and the Persistence of Counter-Reformation By Peter Paul Fuchs, 32nd Degree in PDF."
3,Detroit Lions Time of Glory,"I bought this book hoping that it would have content about a period of time when the Detroit Lions were the champions of the NFL. This is a time period when the NFL did not have the popularity that TV was to create after the overtime championship game of 1958. I was disappointed in that only a minor portion of the book described the Lion's players and the important games they played in that time period. Mostly the book was about plays that were described by the Lion's coach Buddy Parker and his philosphy about how to play winning football. However, in spite of not being what I hoped for; the limited player and game content was interesting and I am glad I bought the book."
4,Rolling duffel,"Its a good rugged bag with high capacity. The wheels took on Amsterdam's cobblestones with no problem. Could use more internal compartments, but that is a small issue."
3,I will keep it...But other is better,"I use both TCL 29"" rolling duffel. But I like the mult-pocket one(more pocket room with 3 roller and the covered lock handle). It is way better then the 2-section duffel, the handle will not lock in place(down position)."
3,lenth of spring coil should be longer,"I have received the product very quick and fast. In order to follow up the direction, I had to buy right size drill bit then I used the direction, but thread I was repairing needed longer coil. Coils in the package are short, it would have been nice to pick the length of coil you need in the package.Other than that, cost/performance of this product is acceptable."
4,A greaat fantasy really enjoyed,"I found a First Edition copy Circa 1917, some years back and it was the second time I had read the story. The first time was a very beat up Bantam Paperback, probably from the 50s. It is what it is, Fantasy, it has humor, vivid descriptions to peek the imagination and is just a Fun read.The First Edition, I kept for about 10 years right next to a First Edition Tarzan. One day I did what was probably a foolish thing, I packed it up and sent it to, Peter Jackson in New Zealand. I got a nice letter of thanks with his signature, probably signed by one of several Secretaries but at least someone in his organization acknowledged getting it. Perhaps one day he may do it as a movie, strange things happen."
4,Live vesion of the music you love or hate,"BTA's music is something you either love or hate. I found it addictive but I fully understand there are people who don't care for it.This album has 9 tracks, 5 studio tracks and 4 live ones. 4 of them are the live versions of the studio tracks so if you think that's a rip-off, get ""Skullgrid"" first. But it is a great experience to compare those two versions of the same songs.I got to give Charlie Z credit for leading to play their insanely technical tunes live since it's up to the drummers to play music on stage. Recording music is one thing, playing it is another. These three guys can really play."
5,Instrumental Prog-Metal Fury!!!,"I don't know how long i've been waiting for this...ever since becoming a fan of them about two years ago when I came across their website. This is...tech-metal perfection, and I love the more melodic parts that they added to their songs...when I first heard them they made my jaw drop. Colin, Mike and Charlie...I love you guys...as long as you keep cranking out the music, i'll always be listening. Seriously, this is some technically ferocious,orgasmic,cranium crushing instrumental prog metal and will be loved and coveted by musicians and metal/avant-garde fans everywhere!"
1,I hope Ms. Phillips isn't a teacher...,This book uses far too much theory and virtually no examples for clarification. I had hoped for a book that would give me something to *do* with XML. There has to be somthing better. Don't waste your time with this one.
2,Not an example...,"This book looks very nice in the shelves, it's fat and with a very nice cover, but inside is really a dissapointment. The writer it's the most theoric one that i had read in all my life. There are chapters that doesn't have a single example in them.This book looks more like a RFC paper than a book itself..."
2,"If you want to read a book about XML, try another one!","I'm an IT professional and I don't use XML in my work. I just wanted to find what XML is about. So I decided to buy a book. It happened that I chose this one. And I didn't like it.First of all, the author writes a lot, but says few things. This becomes annoying. Then, another thing that I didn't like is that, after reading 150 pages, I couldn't tell anyone what XML was about. I had to go to www.w3c.org, spend some time reading some XML specifications and then come back the to the book. Only after I did this, the book made sense to me... But I bought the book in order to avoid reading the W3C specifications. I wanted something ""lighter"" than the standards...Probably the book has some good things, but I don't want to mention them here because I am too affected by the weakness of this book.My advice: if you want to read a book about XML, try another one!"
2,"Great figure, poor accessories!","This action figure COULD have been great. The figure itself is durable and my son really likes it. But none of the accessories that came with it work properly. They will not stay on, and they don't perform the actions that they are supposed to. So they were tossed aside, and the figure gets used by itself. We've been finding the same thing with all the mattel action figures that he has."
3,Eh,"This figure although it has a great sculpt and character supporting it seems to lack in color appeal. I'm not big on the color scheme of this Batman, is he a circus clown or a dark knight? I don't think Mattel can tell!"
2,They don't want to be here,"Tom and Ray are a lot of fun on the radio but seem uncomfortable here. Maybe because they are guests.Awkward jokes like ""My brother's been responsible for a lot of personal wind"" and ""If we tell you the answer, we'll have to kill you"" might have been funny once upon a time but don't hold up.Lots of great info in the narration..""1% of a cars energy is used to move the driver"" Lovens claims 3 1/2% later. ""People buy heavy cars because they feel safer in them"" Which raises the unanswered question, ""Are we safer?"" Nice race car crash footage. Was the driver protected by carbon fiber?Great graphics! If you are interested in the subject, look for FutureCars on Discovery."
3,Cream Whipper Is SoSo,"I bought this product for my wife for Christmas.There are some real problems:The valve on my unit, controlling the discharge of the whipped cream doesn't seal properly;Liss USA doesn't seem to ever answer its telephone number;There doesn't seem to be any place where you can buy the optional decorating valve tipsClean-up on this unit requires very small bottle brushes--and tons of elbow grease.Buyer be aware . . ."
2,Not much there,"I was surprised to find the book the size of a pack of cards but not nearly as thick or useful. Each section is a summary, nothing more. You're better off using free resources on the web.The Tao Of Writing: Imagine. Create. Flow."
4,Great - Except for the brush,"Love the lip gloss, so I bought the Full lip color (in Roxanne). Thicker than the gloss - which you'd expect, but with the same scent and ""tingle"". The color is like a lipstick - much more intense than I expected.My only complaint is the Brush. It's hard to apply just a light layer. I had to swap it out for the wand from my empty gloss - and now it's awesome."
3,"I like the colors, but they don't have a lot of staying power","I liked this gloss in some ways and not in others. The colors are all really pretty. I tried three different ones and they were all nice--not garish or crazy. The gloss is advertised as a lip plumper and I feel that it does that, too.The only problem is the staying power. I just feel like the gloss wears off really, really fast. Maybe I'm expecting too much from a lip gloss, but Clinique's Superbalm and even regular old Carmex seems to have a lot more ""gloss"" after a few hours than this one. I felt like I had to constantly re-apply, even when I was just drinking something.So, here's the deal. The colors are all really pretty, but if you hate re-applying your gloss all day long, I think you might be disappointed."
4,"Ooh La La: Comfy, Pretty, and Refreshing","I recently purchased Buxom Lips in Bambi, and I'm quite happy with the product's look and feel. The Bambi shade is a bit more coral colored than I'd expected (I thought it'd be more of a pink), but I like nonetheless. The caramel-scented gloss is not thick or gloopy - just a little does the trick and my lips feel moisturized after each use. The tingle on your lips is refreshing, not overpowering. I haven't noticed any true plumping power, but the glossy shine makes lips appear fuller. Good product. I look forward to trying some other shades!"
3,Plump is minimal,"I have two of the BE's Buxom Lips that I received with kits I purchased. I can't say that I noticed any plumping. I feel the mild burn/tingle, but no difference in my lips appearance. These glosses smell wonderful and their texture is nice too. I think Urban Decay's plumper works the best for plumping, out of the ones I've tried."
3,not bad,I ordered the Starr buxom lips for the color not necessarily for the lip plumping capabilities. I absolutely loved the color but it definitely tingles more than I want it to! I will try to find a similar color without the limp plumping.
4,Great color,Love the color wish it would stay on longer. They sent it in a very large box I am sure to get the postage up.
4,Kanani Buxom lips,"Very nice color but unsure if the ""lip plumping"" is working. I would buy this product again for the color and the feel of the product."
2,The formula is way too sticky....,"I have used Bare Escentuals makeup for years. I love most of the line, but not this one item. First, when you apply it, it makes your lips tingle. And it has made my lips unusually sensitive once it has been removed. Then there is the stickiness. I have long hair and the the Buxom Lips lip gloss was like a magnet for my hair. I just couldn't keep it from my lips whenever my hair fell forward. Yuck! It felt goopy and sticky. I like lip glosses, but just not this one. Too sticky for me...."
5,got my order in zero time,"I love this lip gloss. The order arrived within a couple of days,faster than if I had ordered directly from the company. Thank you Amazon. YOU ROCK."
2,Check out colors first,"When I purchased this set, I was trying to save money over the larger Buxom lip polishes, but I was very disappointed in the colors. Very odd andones I really could not use. I gave most of them away."
4,buxom,disappointed but maybe I was expecting too much! i do like the color anf feel of the lip polish! plumping...not so much!
3,"Long Lasting, but it's too sticky and burns","I have the Buxom gloss in the color ""Tonya"" and I love how to color works - not too bright, but with good color payoff. The color lasts a loooong time, but I feel like the gloss is too sticky and the plumping effect burns my lips - so much that they stay red overnight and became chapped in the morning. I didn't notice much plumping - just burning. I think the Too Faced Glamour gloss was a better option for me - less sticky and the plump does work without searing my lips."
1,burned my lips,I guess I'm in the minority on this one. It's very heavy and sticky plus it makes my lips burn. I would call this more than just a tingle; a very unpleasant feeling. Wears off quickly too. Not at all impressed with this one.
3,Feel the burn!,"I received a free sample of this lip polish in the color ""Sugar."" Not realizing it was a lip plumper at first, I started freaking out bit when my lips started to tingle and almost BURN. Not a fan of that sensation, and it just can't be good for you. I didn't notice any major plumping of the lips, but I did like the sheer color and gloss, which was flattering and stayed in place longer than many other glosses. So, if you don't mind the tingle, this product may be for you."
4,Buxom-Dolly,"The color is great! I usually enjoy mauves. Although the product is a bit sticky, it stays on great, smells & tastes good. It's quite shiny & I absolutely LOVE the tingle feeling it creates. I think it's expensive & I purchased it only because I had a gift card. But I would definately recommend it."
5,Must Have,"My favorite color....can't live without it!! Wish i could buy it in a store but, if online is the only way to get it i'll take it."
3,Pretty color but no plumping,"Im not sure why I thought it really would plump your lips but it doesn't. It's just a nice lip gloss, similar to the inexpensive ones at the drug store."
2,Bloating,My husband took these for about 3 months. He noticed that he had a lot of bloating and gas after taking these. After he stopped this all went away.
3,Not so sure,"I can only relate my own experience here, but I'm doubtful as to how viable the bacteria contained in these capsules are. I was delighted to see a reviewer mention she uses half a capsule as a yogurt starter in her Salton Yogurt Maker. I just happened to purchase a Salton incubator and ordered these capsules the same week so using them in tandem seemed like a lucky coincidence and also it would prove to me the quality of the capsules. To be certain I used 3 capsules for just 1 quart of prepared milk as per all the instructions and there was absolutely no reaction or change in the milk. So until I somehow find otherwise, I remain a disappointed skeptic.Seems I was a little too quick on the draw in my review. I sat down and counted last week and sure enough there are 35 billion bacteria in those tablets. But seriously, they work incredibly and I am certain maintaining the correct flora in our bodies is one of the keys to overall well being and good health. Definitely a 5 star product."
1,Did not work and may have caused fungal infection,"I purchased this product due relieve Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptoms and after 4 weeks of use did not notice any difference in the symptoms.Also, I got a fungal infection which I have learned through other research may have been caused by taking probiotics. The research shows that it is possible for probiotics to disrupt the natural bacteria on your skin that typically prevents these types of infections...so be careful when taking these supplements and be sure to notify the Food & Drug Adminstration (FDA) if you notice similar side effects."
4,My opinion...,I have bought this probiotic...but haven't taken it yet. Natures Way is NOT listed in the probiotics currently covered by ConsumerLabs.I have used another less expensive Nature's Way probiotic.I do think probiotics work...but I think you need to take them for a few weeks to a month to see some real lasting effects. It also helps to avoid too much sugar or fruit and maybe even grains...due to yeast issues.It is difficult to know which probiotic to buy and which is effective....and cost-effective. I tend to go with the enteric coated type....though some species of bacteria can survive stomach acid.Will be looking for a cost-effective probiotic for maintenance use.This particular probiotic MIGHT be a good one to start with....depending on how difficult your gastro issues are.
1,Bacteria appear to be dead,"I did some searching on the net on how to test a probiotic. The test that everyone seems to recommend is that you put 4 oz of milk each into two containers and add two capsules of the probiotic to one of them. Then leave them out at room temperature. The milk with the probiotic should congeal into the consistency of yogurt after about 8 hours. My test showed no change in consistency after 15 hours, although the milk with the probiotic smelled like yogurt. The temperature during this time was about 61F."
2,Needs to be Refrigerated,"This item needs to be refrigerated to keeps it's potency, but it was not shipped in a cool package. So the potency is not what it should be."
4,Heavy-duty Probiotic,"After becoming a little ""irregular,"" I decided to try a probiotic product. I settled on this one, because it was top-rated by ConsumerLabs,com. It worked. Within a few days, I had no problems. And a recent colonoscopy revealed I have a very healthy colon. Just one word of caution: This is a very high-potency product. Expect some gas and a little discomfort for the first few days, as your body adjusts."
4,Good probiotic for kids,My 8 yr old can't swallow pills so this is the easiest way to get her to take probiotics. It mixes right up with orange juice and gives it no weird taste.
3,Probiotic for headache suffers,"So far this hasn't worked as I hoped it would, but I bought it because it seemed the least likely to cause migraine problems."
5,This one really works.,Before and during being diagnosed with Gluten intolerance this product helped me a lot. Going Gluten free has made the most difference of all but I still take Primadophilus Optima. Highly recommended.
5,Lots of fun!,"My two year old absolutely loves this toy. He doesn't seem to tire of putting different vehicles together and taking them apart over and over again. He puts everything in the backpack and brings it back and forth between our house and grandma's house all the time.I asked him why he liked his tool kit:""Cause it has tools in it. Cause it has a screwdriver in it and a hammer in it and a wrench in it. We gonna make a dump truck now! The dump truck has three screws! We gonna put that screw in with our power screwdriver!"""
5,Great Toy For Toddlers,"I bought this for my grandson to play with at our home, he has 'fixed' everything in our home..He loves this toy!"
2,The Marine Electrical and Electronics Bible,This book gives an overabundance of information about the electrical and electonic system aboard a boat. Some of the diagrams are not accurate i.e. the thing the author is trying to explain will not work if you construct it the way he is suggesting you should.
2,Not for powerboaters,It was very hard to tell from the description or the reviews that the book is almost exclusively designed for the wind-borne sailor. For example there is very little on multiple alternator charging systems and all pictures of boats are of sailboats.As a result I have a brand new copy for sale.
3,Good Book not Perfect,"It took me a bit to get used to the format of the book, its all outline style, point 1, 1a 1b etc. I did catch some mistakes in some tables... it seemed that wiring sizes in one table were different than another table. I wish some areas had more detailed infomration. But there is a LOT of information here, and he covers every category I can think of. I am currently in the process of rewiring my DC and it is very helpful. I use it in conjunction with Nigel Calder's book, and each has good info. Over all I prefer Calder, but like having both."
2,BIBLE is a BIG WORD to live up to!,"After just a few moments of reviewing the book it becomes clear that the author has elected to present the ""theory"" of marine electrical and electronics systems without much information on practical applications of this information. Although this book would make good course material for anyone studying the subject, the term ""bible"" implies practical information and guidance which is NOT provided in this book. If you are interested in understanding the theory behind the subject, the book could be helpful, if you need practical information on how to diagnose and solve real problems encountered with existing marine electrical and electronic systems, making new installations, or avoiding electrical problems, you'll probably want to look elsewhere."
2,"If you can understand this book, you don't need it.","The book provides a good coverage of pretty well every aspect of marine electrics and electronics. Unfortunately it is written at a level well above introductory so that one needs to know, for example, wiring diagrams, equipment functions, corrosion prevention effectiveness before reading the book. Otherwise it is written over one's head. The author is clearly capable as an electrician but not as a teacher. Missed the mark."
5,million $$ ideas cost pennies to create,"Page after page of unique ideas that don't require a home decorator degree to make the project.Lots of options,designs to choose from with hints how to tweek them for your own style. The instructions are clear to understand and offer economical ways of creating it. If you have problems reading , the pictures are very helpful. Makes a great gift."
5,This Video is FAR OUT!!!,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer ... it IS too short! They sound as good if not better than they did back in the 60's and having seen them this year, they still sound great!!! Having John Denver be a part of this is indeed a bonus. This video is well worth the money!"
1,Worthless,"A slide show of poor photos. Nothing ""interactive"" about it. It took twice as long to download as it did to play it. Glad it was only $1.99, but not even worth that."
5,This is the best book I've ever read!!,"I really enjoyed this book. I usualy don't like to read but this is one of the few I've read by choice. I recomend this book to mature adolesents who wouldn't mind taking a risk!) Many teachers tryed to take this book away from me, so if you don't wanna get in trouble don't buy this book"
1,big let down,"if you are an advanced cardplayer take a pass on this book,this book is basic Common Sense and thats it..just another C grade pro trying to cash in."
2,Meh,"Been there, read that for the most part. Not a bad book per se, but the least helpful I have read."
5,"Sound ""Career"" Advice",This book is great for anyone seriously considering playing poker for a living or even if you just treat the game as more than a hobby. It will force you to ask yourself some tough questions before taking the leap.
2,"Extensive detail on limit big bet fractions, not much else","The book primarily focuses on bankroll size given what fraction of a big bet in limit poker one can make per hour. It is useful in that he emphasizes honesty and having enough hours of experience before generating that estimation for oneself. The rest of the book, mental management, etc. is EXTREMELY sparse and mostly limited to NUMEROUS shameless plugs for upcoming books which never materialized, it seems. Based on the extremely limited usefulness of this book, I can see why publishers didn't green-light his next projects."
4,lots of info,This book will answer most if not all of the questions about playing poker for a living. It focus alot on limit poker but has useful info for no-limit games as well.
1,refers to books that don't exist,This book is filled with references to books that he never wrote or had published.It just doesn't make sense when someone says refer to vol 3 of a one vol book.pass
3,VERY DISCOURAGING,"I read it from cover to cover rather fast, trying to get to enlightning info. Ofcourse there was a lot of Very helpful info. But essential is not the word I would use. Most of the book refers to higher limit play per hour, and being honest with youself about your hour rate of winnings. Since most of the newbies play no-limit, he just says things like our bankroll and winnings are harder to gauge.Also he is VERY stringent in what he wants you to follow as a guide for playing, bankroll and other things. If you dont follow these ""Guidelines"" he is washing his hands of you. I do know that most players on the tour are struggling due to other outside ""gambling or other vices"" so telling us to stay clear of those is great advice but who really doesnt know that? Again its good info and I think all aspiring pros should read it for some insight and it will help. But be forewarned its not NO-Limit player specific."
4,How can something be good yet bad at the same time?,"That is the central question to this collection of poems. All of them seem to be intoned with a sense of intentionally attacking the sacred tradition of being serious about poetry. And yet, some end up with beautiful moments and insights. And even if not that, there is still the vibration of enjoying life in an almost chaotic fusion of urge and meditation. Poems range from containing only one line (""I am God""), to pages of what seems to alternately be wandering drivel and intentional questioning of something that Jack seems to see but the reader quite doesn't. Overall, this is a MUST READ for those who like Kerouac. Specifically, at least two poems seem to be inherent to the creation of at least two books (On the Road and Dharma Bums). The Gary Snyder Haikus are downright hilarious in my mind, and capture perfectly that Zen Beatist sense of overindulged mentality in an underindulged world."
2,disapointing,"this collection of kerouac's poems was a great dissapointment. i love his fiction (especially on the road), but his poetry left something to be desired."
1,A wretched book,I agree completely with the previous reviewer except that he is too kind. The book is the sad saga of its author's obsession and in any community where the left had less of a stranglehold on publishing it would not have been published.
3,Good plays but not a very good translation,"This book has 4 plays written in mid-19th century Russia, all set among middle class people. The translation doesn't seem to have been done very well, but it's probably not easy to translate Russian into English. The English just doesn't read very smoothly. The translator loves exclamation points- some pages have 15 or more. There's a good intro which has a biography of Ostrovsky and info about these plays and his other worksI won't bother detailing each plot, but in order they are an unhappy love story, a happy love story, a tragedy and a comedy. The comedy isn't very funny, and it ends so abruptly I think it's incomplete. If you'd like to try one of these plays I recommend the tragedy Sin and Sorrow are Common to All, and if you like it then you could try either the first or the second play."
1,One to avoid; there are better guides out there,"This is easily the least-informed and the worst-written of the corn snake manuals in print today. Those needing a book on keeping corn snakes in captivity would be better off buying one of the following: Corn Snakes, by R. D. Bartlett and Patricia Bartlett; Corn Snakes and Other Rat Snakes, also by Bartlett and Bartlett; and especially The Corn Snake Manual, by Bill and Kathy Love. The first of these is excellent for beginners, the last, by the Loves, is the definitive book on the species. Better yet, buy all three of them, learn, and enjoy."
5,Full of great information,"This book is huge, but fantastic. It takes you on a journey through history, and explains secret societies and their roles very nicely. It is a great book for anyone into philosophy, metaphysics, and esoteric studies. There really isn't much more to say about it, because it is something that must be read."
5,A Reader's Copy of an Extraordinary Work!,"Manly Hall is amazing! Anything written by him personally is a journey that you will not be disappointed in taking. This book is a nice reader's copy that lacks all of the bells and whistles that go along with the large hardcover copies. I love the Jubilee Edition (deluxe anniversary edition with full page illustrations and amazing lettering fonts) which I have in my library but when friends ask me about Many Hall, it is hard to buy them a $160 book to give them a good introduction. This edition solves that problem. All of the text is there but most of the illustrations, with the exception of where the text requires it, have been eliminated and the text size has been reduced but is still very readable. If you have been curious about Manly Hall, this is the book to start with. It is his magnum opus and very good primer to further investigation to a man who dedicated his life to uncovering the mysteries of the world's mystery schools."
4,cheap and handy but not so very illustrated,a nice book containing alot info on many ancients topics. see index. Manly Hall has done a great job here. At some chapters it is nice to know some more of the current mytology on beforehand.for a book this big it's good to have it in a handy paperback. The text is over 70 years and copyright is not renewed so this book is also freely available on the internet. I was hoping this printed book would be more illustrated than the online version. it does have some nice color illustration in the midle but througout the book it was not as illustrated as I expected.
3,A Bit Dated,Not a brilliant read but a quick refresher on my interest in gnostic dementia. Fun but dated. Mostly taken from a Western perspective and not enough of East Asian traditions in this...Eurocentric.
2,"Long, Boring, Superficial Book","Fans of ritualism, mysticism and freemasonry should like this. However, firstly, the teachings in this book are not secret as Hall consulted various books as listed in his bibliography. Also, all the subjects are boring, with the exception of Edwin Babbitt's researches on light and color. Hall declares that Jesus Christ physically existed, but does not provide any evidence for this. The picture section was the best bit. The internet makes this book redundant. Anyone can look at the contents and then search the subject matter online. I regret wasting my time with this."
5,Amazing book about how knowledge was and is still spread in the world today,I was recommended this book from a good friend of mine because we both share interest in true history and this book did not disappoint. A lot of the things inside I had found out about through my own research and it was a great relief to see that my information was confirmed through this wonderful piece of literature. A great read for those searching for true knowledge and enlightenment instead of what is being fed to us to keep people in bondage.
4,Interesting but long,"My main concern is the objectivity of the author, and how his affiliations affected the material that was available to him."
4,Fun Cher talk!,"This book was really fun to read. You can imagine Cher talking while you read the quotes. And even though Cher said ""You can ask me all these questions and never know me"", I still think that reading somenone's quotes from a long period concerning various subjects, you definately can learn something about the person. At least something she wants to reveal. And even more if you can read between the lines...I borrowed the book from library, but I'll most probably get it for myself."
