5,Very Pleased,"This coat rack is just what I wanted. Simple, easy to mount and functional.Arrived within a few days of ordering.I am very pleased."
3,Some disturbing sounds,"Before purchasing be aware there are three odd additions to what is called a Native American Sound. There is a rather amateurish sounding Spanish guitar piece, some drums that are obviously metal and people faking a horse snorting sound on the last track. I can forgive all but the last item, being a horse person :) There are some enjoyable sounds to listen to here if you can ignore these three glaring items."
5,Great Cookbook!,"Wonderful cookbook from one of the weight loss ""oldies but goodies"". It was worth the price for the Moussaka recipe alone!"
2,Yawn.,Very disappointing and tedious! The only person THIS interested in Alice Munro's ancestors is...Alice Munro.
3,She is a master!.,"Alice Munro is a master, and The View from Castle Rock contains some of her weakest writing as well as some of her strongest. The section ""Home"" is brilliant, and makes you feel this chill of Canada via Scotland, via Munro's tightly wound characters. the character Irmla may be my favorite fictional character of the last decade. I recommend this book for completists, but may not be the best introduction to Munro, ""The Beggar Maid"" is a better place to start. This book is still eminently worthwhile--the lady can't write a bad sentence."
2,beautifully written but slow paced,"I was very disapointed, I would of expected a real page turner like Runaway was, this isn't it. I wouldn't describe it as 'amazing short stories' like she has for her literary format description on the back of the book more like 'amazingly condenced long stories'. I recomend borrowing this from your local library first before diving into a possibly regretful purchase."
3,Dont believe photo,"The actual item is quite different from the one shown in the photo, in the sense, it is orange instead of red, which makes significant difference in the look.Anyways, its still good looking, but red would have been amazing."
3,Skin Milk foam bath,"Ordered this for my wife since she saw something similar in a store but didn't buy it. The selection and ease of ordering was very convenient. I have not used the product, but she seems to like it and says it makes her skin soft.However, I later found the same product at Walmart for about $4-5 and didn't have to pay shipping. It cost more to ship this item than it cost. I spent about $14 total for this item on Amazon when I could have gone to the local Walmart and got it for much less.I did use a gift certificate and it had the element of surprise and delivery to her office, but the cost was not reasonable."
4,It works,Came on time in a box wrapped in bubble wrap. I used it the same night and use every time i take a bath. As soon as i stepped in the bath i felt so relaxed when i went to lay done i went right to sleep. It kinda smells like milk nothing sweet.
5,"Great - wish it had digital version or ""play all"" option!","If you're gonna be sitting down to watch the episodes, it would be nice to have a play all option. They're only 20-30 minutes each and watching the beginnings and endings every half hour is a little annoying. Yes, I know you can fast forward through them, but even my daughters dvd's have a play all for the episodes off Dora!"
5,"Bought as a gift, she loved it!","Personally, I don't watch Sex in the City, but my girlfriend is a huge fan, so, I got it as a gift. From shopping around, this was the best price I found for the complete set. It was perfect when it arrived. Really nicely made and put together very presentably. It was awesome that she could have all the seasons and both the movies all in one set. She loved it."
5,Sex and The City,"This is a beautiful collection and any true fan would appreciate this deluxe edition. The whole set is very classy and is set up like a book, highlighting each season."
5,Happy and Proud!!,It took forever for my collection to get here :( but once it did..... It is just the most beautiful thing and i have been enjoying it since!!! :)
1,Poor Quality,This disks for the first three seasons are very poor. Save your money!! These look as though they were made from a video from a theater seat! I have not looked at season 4 yet. I hope the quality improves. I paid $130 at Costco.
5,FABULOUS BOX SET PRESENTATION,LOVE Sex & The City and this box set is one of the nicest I have seen for the price!
3,Mindless entertainment,"Had heard alot about the series, but don't subscribe to cable. It was OK for something mindless to watch. After awhile every episode seems the same but with different men involved. I laughed trying to figure out the timeline - did they have a different man every night, every week, ? Had its good points and highlighted the ups and downs of maintaining friendships over time. Probably better watched as a weekly series than to watch 2-3 episodes every night until finished."
4,Almost Fabulous,"I was very excited when I got this season collection as a gift and although I do LOVE it there was one misprint i noticed when I was checking all the episodes. On Season two disk one the publisher of this box set edition wrote ""The awful truth"" for episodes 1 and 2 when episode 2 is suppose to be ""the freak show"". Being a perfectionist, that seems to be a big error on the publishers part...a little disappointing. Also I noticed the quality of the first season (so far) seems to be a little grainy. I'm on season 2 which seems to be a little better. Two small things I noticed but otherwise I do love it. Oh yeah I also ordered better quality disk holders for each individual disk since they were originally put into cheap envelops that don't fit very well in the box."
2,Sex and The City: The Complete Collection (Deluxe Edition),"I was so excited to receive this item in the mail. The packaging is gorgeous. However when I played a disc I noticed how grainy the quality of the picture was. I thought that maybe this was just the disc and tried all 20 discs and the same poor quality was staring right at me in the face. Needless to say I will be returning this item. As much as I love this show, the poor picture quality makes it hard to watch."
5,I love it!,"I watched a few episodes here and there at a short time when I didn't have cable just basic tv. This show would come on a basic tv station. Years later it came to my mind that i should buy some seasons of the show, because I enjoyed the few episodes that I did see. What really made me wanna purchase a few seasons was when I ended up unexpectedly seeing both sex and the city movies. I didn't know you could buy a complete collection like this so I was happy when I found this. It comes with all seasons and the two movies. Some of the reviews are saying that the packaging is a little too snug and you have to pull the disc out. It is true. It is snug and sometimes I have to really pull to get the discs out, but that doesn't make me love this product any less. I will just try to be careful and not break and scratch the discs. I am so excited to own every episode!"
4,"Perfect collection, but bad package.","I bought this collection when it was at a discount. I was really satisfied with the price. The collection is perfect with all episodes, a bonus disc and two movies! I tested every disc and they worked well. The package was heavy with all pages of exquisite printed cardboards. The only problem of this collection is that they put the discs between two cardboards which are adhered tightly. I used a soft cloth which was for my glasses to pull them out and put them into the CD cases."
5,Sex & the City: Complete Collection (Deluxe Edition),"The series & the 2 movies are incredible cause I been wanting to see the whole thing since I seen the first movie of SATC Movie air in Singapore. And then it came out this Sex & the City: Complete Collection (Deluxe Edition), it so damn worth it. I get to know how Carrie knew Mr Big, how Charlotte wanted a perfect family with whom she married to 2 great man, Trey & Harry. How Samantha was like & I don't that Miranda was the first of the gals to get pregnant & married. But I still prefer Aidan to be Carrie's soul mate but too bad he's was married & had kids in season 5, if I remember correct lor."
5,Fabulous !!!,"My ""Sex in the City"" the complete collection is simply wonderful. Ihe DVD Collection Box is beautiful, my discs play perfectly, and I love all the photos and info....This is an awesome purchase. I had no problems with the delivery. Everything is just perfect. If you are a fan of ""Sex in the City"", then this collection is for you!!!! Thank you Amazon because I know I could not receive a better deal than this ANYWHERE!!!!!"
5,Great Collection,"My daughter and I are big fans of the Sex and the City series. I have been hinting to my kids for a long time that I wanted this collection, with no results. I finally decided to buy it as a birthday present for myself. I am glad I waited because the two movies were included. I can't tell you how much I love this collection. The packaging is beautiful, and all of the DVD play very well. My daughter and I have really enjoyed the episodes and the movies, we watch them over and over and always find something that was missed. We are native New Yorkers so we really identify with the story lines. Carrie, Charlote, Miranda, and Samantha are four of the most funny and fabulous women and the men are gorgeous. Best purchase that I have made to date."
5,Love,"I'm a huge Sex and the City fan already so after years of contemplating on this purchase, I decided to buy. I have proud to say that I am satisfied and wish I had purchased soon. It is packaged beautifully and provides protection for the individual discs."
5,Sex & The City: The Complete Collection (Deluxe Edition),This is the best money I have ever spent. I can not say enough good things about this collection. The box it comes in is so very beautiful and the CD are a little snug to get out but better snug than falling out. I can't say anything bad about this collection. I love love love it.
5,My favorite Glass work,"Don't ask me why...it just appeals to all of my musical sensibilities!In my very humble opinion this is one of the first Glass works that creates a genuinely engaging musical experience in the minimalist style (ie: extended sequences of repetition for which he's known--and sometimes reviled--are not to be found here).Instead, Glass fans will adore the variety of rhythmic, harmonic, and melodic material, and it's unlike anything else he's done.While there are clearly moments when it's doing it's duty as a sound track, the overarching theme is one of primal, unadorned noise-making, only orchestrated."
5,A very good soundtrack,"This is very fine music, in Glass's style of course , but very different from Koyaniskatsi and other pieces . It's a pleasure to listen to it . After saying that , what more can I say ?"
4,"Great soundtrack, but too short","Philip Glass is without questions a master at composing soundtracks for films by Godfrey Regio, and predictably, he did it this time again. The music is less all-over-the-place than Powaqqatsi, and not quite as powerful, but is a joy to listen to when you want to relax. He's definitely my favorite modern composer. My only quibble is that it's TOO SHORT! More Philip Glass, please..."
5,One Will Embark On A Personal Journey When Reading This book,"I bought this book in 1997 and over the years (this review was entered in Nov 2008), I have skimmed the chapters for a read (now and then). It wasn't until recently that I read the chapter about ""Co-Workers"" from end to end. Perhaps I was suppose to read this chapter at this point of my life - only God knows. The simple wisdom of this Christ centered woman was extremely inspiring. It was through this chapter that one was given insight into the thinking process of Mother Theresa - evidently molded by her faith. I highly recommend this book."
3,Jewels among pebbles,"One of those samplers you don't like to play all through. I preselect the titles by Waxies Dargle. The Irish Ceili Band plays ""nicely"" which is among the rather bad things I would say about Irish musicians. Sure the whole stuff is drinking songs, you can sing along with easily. Don't expect lots of animation. If I had not been looking for versions of ""Parting Glass"", I preferred a pure Waxies Dargle."
5,Fabulous harmonies,"Great CD! Beautiful harmonies, well done. Entertaining. Has become a favourite for listening. Songs I always remembered from many years ago, enjoying them just as much this time."
2,Not one of my favorites,Eric Bogle is an artist that I enjoy listening to. The music on this CD is great but I find the talking to be very distracting. I would prefer to have the songs on their own.
5,Fantastic New Album!,"Relient K continues to impress on so many levels. First of all, the lyrics are VERY catchy, ranging from deep theological truths, to cries for help from God, to silly things one hears playing on after school specials. Second is the sound, ranging from bubble gum pup punk, to solid rock tunes with passionate vocals. Third is the length of the album, which is extremely satiisfying and leaves you full of good music. Relient K really has something for everybody, and so that's why I reccomend this CD!"
2,Not the same band,"I dont know about new fans, but some of the older fans of Reliant K are missing them. Where'd they go? This is a good question to ask before you buy this. The sound of the band is... similar, however in some of the songs i wonder if they've lost their edge. The cleverness in the lyrics are all but gone, and are only in maybe 1 of the tracks. (crayons can melt on us for all i care) I don't know, this band is just going in a direction where they are going to lose ALOT of their fanbase. While christian music isn't 2 bad, it isn't the most popular genre by a long shot."
4,Very well done!,"This is a very good CD from Relient K. My personal favorite song is Devastation and Reform. Matt Thiessen's piano playing is a great addition to the Relient K sound. The only thing that keeps me from giving this CD 5 stars, is that I don't like ""Faking My Own Suicide"" all that much. However, you will not be wasting money buying this album. It may have to grow on you, but you will like it. (written by MisterBassman from K Team)"
2,Not what we expected,Purchased the unit based on the Matag history. Worked fine for 6 months then it developed a load noise.Service said it was a warped motor assembly. Had it replaced. 2 months later same problem they replaced the unit again. Started making the noise again they finally decided that the stainless interior had warped and they needed to replace the entire unit. Ordered replacement waited a week without washer and when it arrived as they were taking it out of the box they noticed that the bottom feet where bent and broken. Ordered a replacement for the replacement and after another week it arrived and when opened the bottom of it was more damaged that the first one. Vendor replaced it with a GE unit and am totally happy. Matag quality is not what it was.
5,Brilliant performances,"Having heard and read a great deal about the Kapell Edition from BMG, I was very interested in this set from the ""Great Pianists of the 20th Century"" series. Kapell's performances of the Rachmaninoff 2nd Piano Cto and the Rhapsody on a theme by Paganini are justifiably legendary. The Prokofiev is excellent, too. I have found that I am listening to these performances much more than I normally would with a historical reissue. The remastered sound is quite good---full, warm mono from the early 50s. But it's the perfomances that win over the listener, especially the Rhapsody, which is often described as demonic. Kapell brought an urgency to these Romantic warhorses, but never at the expense of their fundamental lyricism. The listener is left with a profound sense of sorrow that he died so young, as well as extreme gratitude that we have these recordings with which to remember him."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I don't usually read romances, but I thought this storyline might have potential. The ending was a pleasant surprise, but this is not a book I am going to pass on to friends as a ""MUST READ""."
4,Soothed,"As soon as I came in from the briskfully chilled winter evening, the power button on my stereo was pushed. All of a sudden my heart stopped and the sound I was hearing was like a hot flame feeling ice cold along the spine of my back. I laid back on my plush sofa and imagined what a beautiful world it is out there, even when we get ice and snowstorms in Minnesota. I will always turn to the music from this day forward. I absolutely love Jazz Blunts"
5,"Charming ""Life with Dachshunds"" with a Twist","The twist is that the author presents his dachshund trio mainly through his dialogues with them, and these cheeky, irreverent interchanges not only enliven the book but highlight each dog's unique personality. Along the way I learned a lot about dachshunds in general, and the later chapters, in which the dogs explore their new farm, are especially interesting. The couple's delight in and devotion to their canine family shines through on every page."
4,Great for researchers,"The Greenwood Bio-Bibliography series of books offers valuable information for researchers and others interested in locating printed information about film stars. It gives detailed lists of magazine articles, books, newspaper articles, etc. with information about the content, photos, etc. of each article. The biography is brief (under 100 pages) but very well written and engaging and is good for those looking for a general synopsis of her life. For those looking for a juicy biography with more content, you will probably want to look elsewhere (actually the only full length biography of Jennifer Jones so far is ""Portrait of Jennifer"" by Edward Epstein). This book also includes some wonderful black and white photos."
3,Way over priced,"This is a nice, but slim volume, and far more expensive than it should be for it is. In fact, were it not to be a present for a hard core Jennifer Jones fan I would never have paid this much."
2,Not what I was looking for...,"This book is great for people who need serious organizational help. It provides lots of useful tips. I, however, was looking more for information on how much time I am realistically going to have to spend on my home business, and the most efficient way to allocate that time, rather than how to use a day planner and how to organize a cupboard or closet, etc. I pulled a few good tips out though."
1,Not what I expected,"This particular book didn't have the information I was looking for,it was a very inexpensive used book and it shipped in great time, it just wasn't what I thought it was. Amazon is still the greatest and I will order again.Thx"
1,chipped in many places,"I wanted my money back when my grandmother text me pictures of her christmas gift I sent her, it was chipped in numerous places, inside and out, I was shocked at the quality, and i wanted my money back, but she said she would just put them up on her shelf for looks, that wasnt my intentions, I wanted her to be able to use them. I still have the pictures she sent me. and I would love to post them for everyone to see. I wont purchase from this seller again."
1,God awful,"Normally I like tribute albums -- I've found some creative covers of good songs. But this is absolutely horrendous. Teddy Zig Zag's flat rendition of ""Friends in Low Places"" is worse than a late-night karaoke sing-along. ""The Dance"" featuring Bobby Kimball from Toto underscores why Toto has been defunct for 20 years. And 2 bars into ""The Dance"" by The International Country All-Stars (whose name speaks for itself) sent me running to the computer to shut off the CD!"
5,Slows down his eat and makes dinner time more fun!,"I just bought this product today from a retail store. Not only was it inexpensive ($5.99 at the store) but it's great! I wanted something that would slow down my dog's eating. He's a little beagle and he wolfs his food down in about 2 minutes flat! His food (about 1 cup) fit perfectly in the 3"" molecuball, which is great because I was a little worried about the size, and it took him about 15 minutes to roll it around and get all the kibble out. He even licked and chewed on it a little after to make sure he got all of the food out. He looked pretty cute the whole time! He's not an aggressive chewer so it easily withstood him, but if your dog is strong jawed you may want to take this away from him as soon as he's done getting the food/treats out. The only recommendation I would make to the manufacturer is to put the capacity on the box so dog owners who are buying the product know which size will hold their doggie's dinner."
4,"Pretty Good, but the ""Buster Cube"" is better","I like the shape of this one (and my dogs seem to like to carry and throw it because of its shape), but the opening for it is too large and not adjustable like with the ""Buster Cube."" What this means is that kibble comes out really easily--which is fine if you want to make it a very fast game for them. But I find it's too easy and too fast a game for my two little ones (35 and 25 lbs).I have the buster cube also and like that one better."
3,Maybe not for strong chewers,"I first bought the 5"" ball for my coonhounds, but the hole was so large I didn't know what to put in it that wouldn't fall right back out, so I exchanged it for the 3"" ball. The hole on the 3"" ball is perfect for kibble or small treats. However, after about 3 minutes of batting it around one of my dogs decided to get the treats out by ripping the whole top off, which took him about 1 minute."
4,Decent toy,"Sometimes larger pieces do not want to come out and the puppy will lose interest. This will cause the food to rot and smell, since it's difficult to get out. However, I find a vigorous shaking usually gets those pieces out.Also, because it's made of a harder plastic, the dog doesn't like to bite it very much. She'd rather bat it around with her nose and have the food come out that way. But I'm sure that's the way it was designed.A decent toy. Nothing ground-breaking about it."
4,Good food toy,"We have two dogs that love their food. Our first dog loves her ""Buster Food Cube"", however the hard plastic is a little noisy on our hardwood floors. We purchased the Atomic Treat Ball for our second dog and did find that the softer plastic is a little quieter. The shape of the toy makes it more difficult for the dog to manipulate, however the inside of the toy is basically hollow with a fairly sizeable food opening and the food falls out with no difficulty when the opening is pointed down. The Food Cube's rounded cube shape seems easier for the dog to manipulate, however the inside of the toy is somewhat of a maze and consequently the food does not fall out as easily. I suppose they're both equally difficult for the dogs, just in different ways. Neither of these toys seems susceptible to chewing so wear and tear is not an issue. If I had it to do over, I would buy the Atomic Treat Ball again."
5,"""Munchie Ball""","Over the years I have had this toy for several dogs, they all really enjoy playing with it and getting treats"
3,Cool product which might not survive,"Really a neat, smart product, especially if you love new electronic toys. What I am concerned about is not the watch but Microsoft, which with its notorious arrogance might kill it before it has the chance to grow and glowTheir customer support is everything but support. The ""first line"" technician is very polite, but cannot help beyond taking your info and refering you to a ""specialist"", which if you are lucky, will call you in 4-5 (business) days.Microsoft is not very good in keeping their promises either; they say the sport channal is""around the corner"" and even use it in their ads, but it has been just around the corner for the last three months. They also promise ""new watch face every month"", well I own the watch for 3 month now and got just one new face when I subscribed.So it's in Microsoft power to keep this watch ticking..."
2,Suunto is low quality and lower service,"I enjoyed the MSN service but my Suunto n3 equipment didn't last the year of my MSN subscription or my extended warranty. I took the watch back to CompUSA where I bought it but they don't sell the watches any more so they wouldn't honor my extended warranty. I haved called Suunto customer service repeatedly for a month but nobody has talked to me or returned my calls. Now I have five months left on my MSN subscription but no working watch. If you are really interested in a SPOT watches, they are pretty cool but I would recommend staying away from Suunto."
1,large mother,"cool technology, but the styling and size of this watch are insane. my recommendation is that you buy it......if you like strapping boat anchors to your wrist. i saw another two (Fossil and Abacas) that i could actually fit under my shirt sleeve. i think that i will return this and get one of those."
2,"overrated, again microsoft in over it's head","I feel gyped after having used this a few months. It has a few neat features and keeps perfect time but it's ugly, heavy and has no two way anything and to have to pay MSN on top of this is obscene"
2,Would not buy again.,"The cotton fabric is nice and absorbs liquids just fine, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this product. The satin fabric on the edges is poor quality and we had loose threads hanging all over right after the first wash in the laundry machine (gentle cycle, mind you). Also, the opening for the neck is very small - my daughter is 6mo. old (average size) and it's already too small for her. Would never buy anything from this brand again."
2,Not fantastic,"Like many have mentioned, this is made in China. And it started to peel just after the first wash - very disappointing. It's also tight around the neck, which is not very comfortable for my baby. Good thing though is that it is thick and can really absorb lots of drool. Given a choice, I wouldn't want to buy it again."
1,Cause breathing problems for infant,"The quality of fabric is very very poor. The material is fluffing and too much lints come out of it. Difinitely, causes the breath problems for infants."
2,Get the job done but don't hold up well,"These bibs are a good size for a newborn, especially a bigger newborn. My son was 8lbs 10oz and it was a great size to start him off with. Out of the package they are good looking too but after a few washes they started falling apart. They still do the job but look terrible. Now, I couldn't take him out in public in the condition that they are in and my baby is only 4 weeks old."
1,Worthless,"These bibs are tiny and poorly made - the trim has frayed and come completely apart after only two washings, and is of course synthetic. Save your money or spend a little more and get muslin bibs. There's no point in paying more for what end up being used as (supposedly) organic rags."
2,CHINA,"nothing wrong with these bibs but they are made in CHINA...I was looking for organic and I was thrilled to find these, didnt think to see if they were made in China...."
3,Not As Funny As I Thought...,"The only two sections that were laugh out loud funny were the ones reguarding ""vaseline"" and ""hygiene."" I was a little dissapointed to be quite honest."
4,Madea's Don't Make A Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings,"Tyler Perry is one of the most gifted men out there today in the entertainment world. He does it all!! I have enjoyed all of the Madea plays and movies, and have enjoyed the audio CD's mentioned above. I listen to those in my car and find them most entertaining, with such a very profound message. I gave the CD's a 4-star rating because I prefer watching Madea rather than just listening to her (him)."
5,Tyler Perry is always a winner,THis book was so funny. It's great to read what 'Madea' writes about her life. There were moments that had me laughing out loud and sharing with my family. Tyler Perry never disappoints.
5,don't make a black woman take off her ear rings,"The book was great, really just as good as the plays, many times life has a way of knocking you down, But I thank God for people like you Tyler you have the gift to make people laugh in the mist of there Storm and that book did it for me. thanks again."
4,Hillarious yet Inspiring...,I love Tyler Perry and Madea is my girl hands down. Madea broughtout a lot of things in this novel and even though I have already heard much of what is written from his movies and plays it was still refreshing to hear the advice again. God bless Tyler!
3,Madea's Book,Delivered in great condition. The tape is better than reading the book. This book is nothing like Tyler Perry's plays and movies though.
4,Love this book!,This book was funny and very entertaining! Madea's point of view is hilarious and true. I definitely recommend it.
4,Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings,"I am reading this book right now and I am totally enjoying myself. If you love Madea, you will want to read this book. I had to have it when I first saw it."
1,don't write another one please,"Ok, Tyler please stick with the stage plays. You don't have to put them on DVD, TBS or nothing. I like you on the stage only cause that book was awful. I gave that book away to a friend and I never give books away. I did learn two good things...use vaseline for everything and keep a next door neighbor as a friend so you guys can swap playing sitter. I also learned a few things about Tylers childhood...he has been dressing up for a while"
1,Don't Make a Black Woman take her earrings off was excellent,"This was an excellent audio book. Done in the voice of Madea the hardcover could not have matched it. Some of the language did get a bit much, but the content advice, humor, and reality were both entertaining, informative and inspirational as well as giving some real life reality checks. I hope Tyler Perry continues on."
3,"Why are readers taking this books to heart, it's a book, written by an Fictional Person!","We have to remember that this is fiction, just as Terry Perry Movies and Plays. I feels it's to make you think, laugh and draw your own conclusion. Instead of picking out things that you did not enjoy, try picking out things that were good about the book, that made you think. Many times you may read something that isn't entertaining to you, but entertaining to others. In purchasing this book, you have to remember that Madea is a man in women clothing, and accept it for what it is, entertainment.I feel his objective in writing this book, was to give an background for Madea, which I feel he is probably asked often, when writing his plays and movies. So he decided to write a book, that he feels would entertain and inform many.Take if for what it is, and hopefully read more, light hearted reading."
1,He Should Stick to Writing Plays!!,I don't know about this so called book that Mr. Perry has written. It really doesn't capture to much of your attention especially if your black because half the stuff that is said in this book you have already heard and most of it was from his plays. I don't know i just think that he should stick to writing plays and not book because he is just not good at it. The language is simple as well as the idea and i wish i could return it but i can't i spilt coffee on it!
1,Madea Is Disappointing,"Madea Is Disappointing. When I began reading this book I wanted to laugh, laugh and continue laughing. After getting into it I realized this book was no more than a bunch of jotted notes combined to make a quick book for quick profit.I think Perry could have had a better story plot. Some parts of the book was funny, but others seem like Perry/Madea was trying to had to tell a joke. For example, the part about growing up with Brittany Spears grandmother was suppose to be funny but it was not. The punchline about the WWNBA was worst than the Brittany Spears trailer park joke.Tyler tried to hard to make this book fun, but it simply was not. He really dropped the soap on this one. The only reason why it will sell is because its Madea.As Madea says in the book, if you brought it and don't like, too bad, you still brought. In simplest terms, I have your money, the books not funny, the joke is on you."
2,Black/white -does it matter?,"I can only imagine what would blacks think about this book if written by a white person-where the author would quote 'if you don't understand this book go find a white person'.I feel that the blacks would scream racism over this, especially if also told why 'whites would want to act like a black person'.I can only imagaine a book being written as such, and how popular it would be then-it would probably be banned from printing-and taken to court for predjudiced complaints.The book was ok, but there are many others that are just as good-I would just as well liked to read something by Bill Cosby.My opinion, yes, we are all entitled to one !"
3,TP Does It Again !!!,"Tyler Perry couldn'tve done it better...LOL!Madea is hilarious! She just talks about life the way it is and holds no bars. I wanted to get the book, but I was sure the CD was much better. It is...but just in case my CD stops working...I'll order the book too.This one is a keeper...if you like to keep a collection like we do, this one is a great addition. (Right along with ""Bill Cosby, Himself"")"
5,Madea Does It Again,"It took me about 2 hours to read the book cover to cover. I laughed out loud, reflected about my own Madea, and most importantly did some soul searching. This is a great book and will make a great gift for Easter or Mother's Day. If you are a Tyler Perry fan YOU must own this piece of literature ... your collection is incomplete without it."
3,It's ok but i expected more humour,I bought this booking because I love Tyler Perry and the Madea character. I think sometimes she is my hero. I was looking for her sharp wit and humour and to laugh all the way through the book. Although this book is definately thought provoking and I love her opinions on how to raise children and find a man. She is right on the money whether you like it or not. The problem is I thought this was going to be a funny laugh all the way through book and it really isn't. I like it and it's ok but I think Tyler can do soooo much better than this. I certainly hope he writes another one but puts more of her sass and lots of laughter it it.
5,One for a friend-one for me!,I bought this book for a friend who recently had surgery. Then I decided to buy one for myself as well. Both books came in great condition and in a timely manner.Looking forward to hours of great reading. Will remember to use this shipper in the future!
5,Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings,"This is a wonderful book, and Madea should really be ashamed of herself for indulging us in such things about her life. I could hardly read the book because I was laughing so hard that I was crying. She is really something else!!!!"
4,Funny Book,Good Advice with a lot of humor sprinkled in. Very good book. Next a cook book I would love to have that Sweet Potato Pie recipe.
4,Entertaining and insightful,"This book is light entertainment, but slips in some very insightful thoughts from time to time. Very enjoyable reading."
4,Funny,I just finished reading the book and Madea is hilarious. I hope she will follow up and do a cookbook. The book was funny and at the same time it gives you time to think about your own values in life. I love Tyler Perry and he is a very talented man. I wanted Madea to go more in depth about her family. I wanted to read more on Mr. Brown and her daughter Cora.
1,Misses the mark,"While I thoroughly love Tyler Perry's plays and movies, this book misses the mark with me for several reasons.I enjoy reading books that take me on a journey, but I have to say, the journey with this book is slow and long. It is boring and has no plot whatsoever. Since this book was given to me as a gift, I am forcing myself to read it.While Madea has some very interesting antedotes, I find that this book goes around in circles. I thought I'd be rolling in my seat laughing. It's not funny at all.I think Tyler Perry definitely has a niche with film making and movies, but, in my humble opinion, this book doesn't live up to his ability."
1,Very Overrated,"This book is very overrated. Perry's films are entertaining, but when it comes to writing novels, he falls very short. Tyler jumped from boring subjects to corny jokes with terrible punch lines. He attempts to tell the story as Madea is telling it herself, but throughout the book he sometimes forget Madea's suppose to be telling the story and ends up speaking as himself. Simply speaking, this book is/was over hyped."
3,For The Record,"I recently purchased The 2nd Time Around and Tyler Perry's Madea's books as a package and I must go on record and admit The 2nd Time Around is funnier. Although both Hawkins and Perry are new comers in the writing industry, Hawkins' novel appears more polished than Madea's constant ramblings throughout Don't Make a Black Woman Take off Her Earrings. Hawkins, a fairly unknown author, is currently climbing up the novel's top-selling list and may soon be a force to reckon with in the book industry. Hawkins' book is solid throughout all the chapters as opposes to Perry's book, which has no storyline and most of Madea's jokes seem forced. She simply tries too hard to be funny. I love Perry's screen plays and movies, but on this book he dropped the ball. On a brighter note, Madea Goes to Jail is very funny. That's the Madea I would love to read about!"
3,It's pretty good but not like his first CD,"I love most of pit's songs but in this CD there are a lot of songs that i dont like but then again thats just me,i loved the first CD he came out with it has a lot of awsome songs in it."
3,monry is still a major issue- pitbull,"if you like pitbull, and you wanna know what material he has done get it. i thought it was good but not as good as MIAMI. alot of callaberations which is cool"
2,"Money is an issue, but not that much.","Pitbull's 3rd album from the 2004 M.I.A.M.I brings something at least different, though not much else, despite some good beats and some good songs, pitbull is just flat and distorted.This is a somewhat albumMusic Rating **1/2 Stars.So a marginal thumbs down for me."
3,So-So,"I seem to be in the minority on Amazon, but, having jut finished I, Claudius I have to give it 3 stars. It was mildly entertaining, but didn't make me want to read the sequel. Considering that I, Claudius ends with Claudius being proclaimed emperor (kind of a cliffhanger) not wanting to see what happens is an obvious sign that something just didn't work. Other reviewers disagree, but this book just isn't a page turner (likeThe Ruby in Her Navel: A Novel, particularly historically accurate (likeRoma: The Novel of Ancient Rome (Novels of Ancient Rome), or very intellectual (likeThe Name of the Rose. If it is none of the above, why bother?"
5,Top entertainment - but history?,"First I have to say that this is one of my all time most re-read books, but then I have to qualify that opinion. Robert Graves has a tremendous sense of drama with which he imbues the Rome of Augustus. The characters and events are viable possibilities for any soap opera.BUT, Graves takes his dramatic, action packed, in-law poisoning, Machiavellian story-line from the very biased and not-necessarily well informed Suetonius (on whom Graves was an expert and translator), subsequently, don't be fooled when you try to substantiate much of the storyline as found in this pair of novels.For fans of the books I recommend the cheap but well written and produced BBC TV version which artfully interprets the two books."
4,All around GOOD book,"Well there are so many things to say about this book so where can I start. First off, the subtle humor of the author is untouchable, Graves is a very good writer. The way he describes the characters in this book gives you a very keen feeling as if you were living in Rome at the time it was written, he gives every one of them a very authentic personality that directly matches the time of history this book takes place in. Just like you know a good actor by the way he makes you feel, you know a great author the same way. As you read you develope likes and dislikes for certain characters and the actiions they perform. Throughout the book you find yourself sub consciously cheering for the ""good""characters and wishing demise for the ""bad"" ones. All in all the book delivers what you want in the end, a good storyline, great character developement, and an all around good book, one of the better one's that I've read. I would recommend it to anyone"
5,The finest historical novel ever written,"I have read both I CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD three times. Once as a teen, in my early 30s and again just recently. These books tell an incredible tale of Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus (Claudius) who through both his phyical shortcomings was able to be spared the insatiable appetite for power between members of his family in Rome in the the first century A.D. However, his physical deficiencies by no means affected his intelligence and he was able to overcome these obstacles to become emperor of the greatest empire in history: Rome.A true classic tale that was also well adapted in a BBC mini-series in the 1970s."
5,"""...this, that, and the other...""","This book is a joy from page one, through its sequel, Claudius The God, to the BBC version of the two. It is great literature, great melodrama, and great history all in one. As you read, you will quickly come to side with Graves' conception of Claudius as not being the dolt everybody believed. It turns ancient Rome into a real place, populated by real people...a society not very much different from our own. I cannot recommend this book more."
4,"Not a fan of Historical Fiction, but enjoyed it","For someone uninterested in Roman politics and history, ""I, Claudius"" took some time to dig into. After I got a feel for the style however, I became engrossed in the survival of Claudius. The corruption of Livia and the injustice that was founded upon by it is a concept that the reader with love to hate.Historical fiction lovers might give this a 5, but as a fiction lover, I found Claudius by far the spotlight of the book, and wished that he was focused upon more."
5,Transcends history,"Robert Graves' ""autobiography"" of Claudius is told with such vividity that it is easy to forget that it is a work of fiction, much less one which was written in 1934. It is too bad that history books do not bring these ancient figures alive as well as I, Claudius does."
5,Painless Education,"If you are interested in learning a thing or two about ancient Rome and want a fast paced story at the same time this is your book. Graves' chronicle of Claudius and his dysfunctional family is full of mystery, humor, intrigue and tradegy. Emotionally, you begin to love, hate and feel pity for these real people. While the military history can become a tad dull, the book as a whole is the best work of historical fiction I have ever read. A top five favorite book of mine!"
5,A great insight to Roman society and politics.,"I'm barely twelve and I read the book.I thoroughly enjoyed this book.It gave me great insight to Ancient Rome and I'm compelled to read the second part.Though I have yet to see the complete mini seiries,I feel the book is still better.I had a miniscule amunt of remebering all the names because it's a gargantuan amount,I can still recall much.Read it if you want a good book."
3,"Good book, Great Story....","I found it hard to follow, but enjoyed the story. I can't decide if I will read the sequel. I love Roman history and this certainly shows the brutality of their society."
3,Not that impressed,"I hate to be the one bad apple in the bunch, but to be honest, I was expecting great things from this book given all of the fabulous reviews. Perhaps because I've been pampered with books like Philippa Greggory's THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL or THE RED TENT, I expected a read that would be quick, with snappy dialogue and luscious settings. What I got instead was something that felt very much dated, and very boring. Of course, this is just my opinion, and I see that many others here have different ones. But for fans of Greggory-style writing, I would give this a pass."
4,It's like living in Rome,"Robert Graves transport you to ancient Rome with all it's grandiosity and esplendor, but also with all the intrigues and excesses. I recomend it to everyone who has an interest in history. I am definetly going to read the sequel!"
5,"Great to read the first time, second time, third time....","I first read I, Claudius and Claudius the God and His Wife Messilina when I was a teen... That was over 30 years ago and I still enjoy reading this saga... This is one of the best story I have read. Also, watch the BBC version of this great saga with Derek Jacoby playing Claudius... Wonderful!"
5,shocks,"Just what I ordered, the I realized I already had a set. The offered to have me send them back but I was able to sell them"
2,Cheap,"Got a emerson one from walmart sd a gift. Then got another one the next year at k mart because i got tired of the squealing (yes I clean my vcrs)but it was the same exact thing except now said sanyo. who knew they were bought out? It ate a tape the first time I put one in and I haf a feeling it would. Had to take it back. Makes horrible squealing noise when rewinding. Hard to set timer, very old looking blue menu screen though it only goes back to 2002. When you tape something and the tape runs it rewinds itself then turns off and comes back on the dvd setting so you have to take the tape out and put it back in to be able to press the vcr button and switch back."
3,Decent writer let down by publisher,"The information in this book is very solid and needs to be heard by women AND men -- especially those in high school and college. However, the book is full of very distracting typos that make it look like it was spellchecked instead of proofread. Sometimes it's even hard to interpret some of the sentences unless you stop and analyze two or more typos to try to get to the intended meaning. I hope the publisher comes out with a revised, corrected edition soon.Lukas has one weird contradiction in the book, where she outlines devastating pitfalls of premarital sex, and then says none of the information should be construed to suggest that women should abstain until marriage. With the case she makes against premarital sex, it ends the chapter on an incoherent note, and she needs to make a case FOR premarital sex, if she wants her conclusion to make sense."
3,Not bad,"Although there were a several things in this book that I disagreed with, the basic premise is that women (as well as men) need to be exposed to all the information that is out there in order to make an informed decision. The author believes that in many woman's studies courses, much important information is being withheld."
4,IT NEEDED TO BE SAID,"I wish this book would've been around when I was in my 20's. I enjoyed reading a more balanced approach to feminism. Lukas is not anti-woman, stuck in the '50's, or patriarchal as her critics have described. She's not telling women what they can or cannot do either. She's done her research and put the fact out there for your review. The biggest drawback for me was that it looks like a 3rd grader proofread the book."
1,Politically Incorrect Guide to the Dark Ages,"Carrie Lukas's latest effort is a bizarrely tangled web of half-truths and opinion. This book contradicts itself in every possible way- the author suggests that women are happiest in the home, barefoot and pregnant and sexually available to their husbands; yet she herself is a satisfied career mom. Why couldn't she write a book on achieving that kind of balance ?I found this book to be offensive in every possible way. What Lukas proposes is sexist and negative, and no proud woman should EVER allow her daughter to read a book which implies she is not as capable and intelligent as a man !"
3,Kudos to Serina for Her Review,"Serena,Let me congratulate you on your little gem of satiric humor (review above). You got just the right mix of self-satire and believability that typifies the best satire. I haven't read the book either, but your review is a gem."
1,"ignorant, and wrong The Incorrect Guide to Women, Sex and Feminism","This isn't enlightening material, this is just distorted propaganda.If you want to learn what feminists believe then have the guts to read their literature.The myths busted cover are misleading, and outright lies."
1,hilariously bad misinforation from a neo-con polemic,This is another book in the revisionist and reactionary PIG series. Anyone who reads this expecting facts which balance out the feminist view point will instead be treated to a right wing polemic. I knew this going in and still enjoy reading passages to friends for a good laugh. My favorite is the slippery slope argument regarding divorce and how the book in not so many words guarantees that children of divorced parents will become alcoholics and drug users.
1,Don't You Try to Tell Me What I Can't Do!,"I found this book to be incredibly sexist, misogynist, and probably racist, too. In fact, I hated it SO MUCH that I absolutely refuse to read it! The idea that some brainwashed, Patriarchy-loving Stepword Wife is allowed to challenge my right to have everything I want is a crime against all women everywhere."
2,"Interested in the Premise, Disappointed in the Presentation","A sober critique of modern feminism has been long overdue for some time. Many who write on the subject either blindly accept all research or blindly refute it as nonsense. With each side unwilling to make logical concessions toward either side, polite discourse quickly degenerates into ad hominem attacks and screaming.I picked up this book in the hopes of getting a more lucid picture of feminist issues. While Carrie Lukas does bring up some important points about misconceptions about feminism, the book was not well-written (With so many typos I question whether it was even proofread) nor was it concise.Like Ann Coulter's books, Lukas does not seem interested in convincing anyone. This book is written only for people who already agree with her."
5,Extension Rod,Getting the hunter rod is a must for proper fit.This works great and gets the air down where you need it.
5,As Advertised,"Worked with our new Hunter fan as advertised. And now the additional twelve words required for this review, I mean really?."
1,Hunter Fan Downrods - Not Quite,Only one end of the two ends were threaded on all three of pieces of this product I purchased.Kinda usless as sent.
5,Now release the rest.,"I am 40 yrs. old and I love this show. It reminds me of a combination of Warner Bros. cartoons, old slapstick and screwball comedies. It's so good to see this show finally get the dvd treatment. There are only 8 of the 20 episodes of season 2 and they are 1)New Semester/Electives 2)Pep Rallies/Lunch 3)Your Body/Procrastination 4)Valentine's Day/School Websites 5)Asking Someone Out/Recycling 6)April's Fool Day/Excuses 7)Secrets/School Car Wash & 8)Spirit Week/Clothes. The transfers are beautiful and as good as could be hoped for. I know a lot of people will not want to buy this because it's not a complete season. Since they are only producing this on demand it is vitally important to purchase and let Amazon know that Ned's Declassified is wanted and should be released completely. The more they sell, the more likely they will be willing to release the rest. Now, hopefully, on to Season 3!"
2,"Wonderful, but too much was cut!","This CD was great as far as it went, but what happened to the wonderful trumpet solo? Also, most of the ""piano duel"" is left out--that was one of the high points of the movie! If time was a problem some of the music that served as background could have been cut, leaving in these wondeful solos. If you want to hear all the music, you are better off trying to find the DVD or video. I found a copy on an auction site."
4,great movie good soundtrack,the movie was really well done and the soundtrack is really great to listen to while relaxing and as a nice backdrop to working.
2,Some of the best parts were left out !! Where's the music ??,"Unfortunatelly, Well, when someone search for a soundtrack CD he(she) expects to find the original music from the movie. Although Morricone work is great, the TOP of that movie is the music of Scott Joplin, Ragtime, etc IN WHICH the film is based... It would be a great idea to launch a complete edition of this Soundtrack with ALL music, including trumpet music, some piano music left out, etc, we need take 2. Perhaps a good idea would be buying CDs of James P. Johnson and Scott Joplin also."
4,"It's good, but the Italian Edition would be better.","I bought this soundtrack (American Edition of course) immediately after I watched this movie, but I regreted when I saw the Italian Edition, because there were 29 tracks in the Italian Edition but only 21 in American Edition! One of my favourite tracks named ""Magical Waltz"" was not in the American Edition! Well, I'll buy the Italian Edition after the Spring Festival. My favourite tracks were:1900's ThemeThe Legend of the PianistThe CraveMagical WaltzStudy for Three HandsA Mozart ReincarnatedChild1900's Madness 1&2Peachering RagPlaying LoveSilent GoodbyeLost Boys Calling"
4,Best song missing!,"There are great songs on this CD and Mr. Morricone deserved any and all awards for ""Lost Boys Calling"" but the song where 1900 helps the new hornblower deal with his seasickness is WONDERFUL but is NOT on the soundtrack; otherwise this is a great CD and an even better movie."
2,not enough jazz music of the time,I enjoyed the movie thouroughly. When I saw the cd I had to get it. I was dissappointed at the lack of jazz music on the cd. There is the famous scene (duelling pianos with Jelly Roll Morton) One song from that scene is on the disc. It is the best song. The rest is like mood music or background. Not enough of the emotional piano jazz.
4,"Great CD, but it is uncomplete","After seeing The Legend of 1900, I had to buy this CD. The music was simply excellent! After listening to it, I noticed that there was something missing...a lot of the movie's best songs! Now, I'm not sure what happened, but I missed those songs. That's not to say that buying this CD isn't worth it, it is, but I feel there should be something like a Legend of 1900 Volume II or something. Anyway, if you haven't seen this movie, you won't be missing anything, so buy this CD. If you have seen this movie, you will miss the songs as I did, but you will not regret having the opportunity to listen to the songs that they did put on the CD over and over again. Oh, for all those of you who haven't seen the movie, buy the CD and then see it. It is DEFINITELY worth it.Merrie, a Tim Roth super-fan."
3,EVH Puzzles Fans Yet Again,"Being a vehement fan of Van Halen, whatever its current incarnation, I bought this CD for the last track - ""Lost Boys Calling,"" with Roger Waters on vocals and EVH providing guitar solos.As a person who falls into a coma-like trance when listening to classical music, I quickly skipped to track 21. The song itself is a good one, with a melody taken from the movie's main theme (track 1). EVH's guitar work is lacking the trademark pyrotechnics his fans are accustomed to, but they really wouldn't fit in this song anyway. Instead, Eddie lends his legendary ""brown sound"" to the tune, and it fits like a glove. There are two separate guitar solos, the first of which is incredible. The second solo is forgettable, reminding one of EVH's ""Respect the Wind"" from Twister.To Van Halen fans: Get this CD just to hear the collaboration between two rock giants. And with Cherone no longer in VH, maybe this song is a preview of the next incarnation of VH.Nah. Too good to be true."
5,RECOMMENDED!!!,"This is an excellent piece of art!!! Great for all sensitive people who like the type of music. However, it's adviseable to watch the film at first; the soundtrack is very specific and you should buy it only when you liked it in the film as well as when you found interesting the motion itself!!!"
5,Best there is!,I already had been using an Aten 2-port component video switcher but needed to increase it to 4-ports. Tried a couple cheaper models but they distorted the signal from my PC's HDtv tuner (Hauppauge 1200) so I paid the $130 for another Aten component video switcher. My learning remote copied the signals from the Aten remote and works great too. $130 is a lot steeper than the $30-$40 dollar switchers but I refuse to suffer any loss of signal quality and the Aten is built with relays so it is like connecting any unit directly to the HDtv. (Note: Picture of mouse is wrong.)
2,Already Bored,"Yes, the language is beautiful. Yes, the characters are brilliant. Yes, the book damn near bored me to tears. This thing needed an editor with an eye for economy. The length isn't necessarily the issue--it's the fact that Johnson overlaps so much of the plot from different perspectives, and I just didn't want to read the same thing over and over again. I'm a big fan of Johnson; loved Fiskadoro, Jesus' Son, Resuscitation of a Hanged Man, but I resented him for dragging me into this quagmire, and making me wallow in it for long."
2,"too anyone who got to the end, i bow to you","I tried 3 times to finish this book, but i just can't do it. I'm a big Johnson fan but this book is just too long to sustain his ethereal style. The language is beautiful but I need to feel connected to these characters to ride this book for 400-somewhat pages. Try Johnson's poetry and short stories, that's the stuff."
2,YAWN!,The positive reviews of this title have spurred me to finish the thing but overall I agree with the negative reviews. Definitely not one of the best books I've read this year.
2,Too much tripping,This is NOT brain candy material. Johnson's synapses must look like the LA Freeway on a bad day. The book is sprawling in a bad way. This is one book to skip unless you have nothing but time on your hands.
2,"I was ""Already Dead"" by the time I finished","Johnson at times has a poetic voice and something of a flair for atmosphere, but 448 pages of lowlifes doing drugs, practicing dime-store witchcraft and plotting murders? This was borderline unreadable. I persisted, waiting for some great truth to emerge from the jumble of contrived plot developments, but after a few hundred pages I was ready to dive off one of those bottomless Pacific cliffs Johnson is always rambling on about. A very disappointing read."
1,This Might be the Worse Book I've Ever Read,"Whatever you do, do not attempt to read this book. It's terrible. It's a chore just to try to follow along. I think he's trying to be ultra-smart with his writing style, but it just comes across as impossible to read. For your own safety, stay away."
4,Insightful Noir,"Denis Johnson gives us, in Already Dead, a fascinating look into the dark side of the human condition. Criminals. Land owners. Drifters. Cops. Three dogs. ... Denis Johnson attacks interesting questions with stylistic prose and subtle humor. The book is sometimes frightening. Sometimes scarey and always entertaining. The book is generally dark and explores our emotional and psychological darkness fearlessly.If you might like a thriller that emphasizes literary brush-strokes and has a strong story then you may find this work to your liking. Those looking for quickly moving populist fiction may find it tedious, however... Johnson does tend to linger on the personal point of characterization."
4,A lotta book,"I read, and re-read this book in the last year. After the first read, I was puzzled. How can one read a book so late into the night, when I should have been sleeping, so many times and not feel satisfied at the end. I found the answer in the second reading. The quality of Johnson's prose is astounding. Descriptions, metaphors, similes fighting eachother for supremecy page to page. I'm not a critic, so excuse me if I only sing this novel's praises.'Already Dead' more than lives up to its title. Each character is doomed in one way or another. The privilege we have as readers is to absorb the mood, the nuance of the characters, the multi-demensional context and the quality of the writing.This is a big book. It drags at times and while there will be moments when you will search in vain for a plot. But the story and the writing provides the will to finish this novel.Neat and tidy? No.Juicy plot? No. But such is life."
3,Tough Guys,"Not sure what Johnston was up to here. The similarities to Mailer's Tough Guys Don't Dance are huge: marijuana patches, seances, spirits, adultry, murder. Paying homage? Except the setting is the west coast instead of the east. The results are the same; is this the point? Really enjoyed it though. Amazing that he took more pages than Mailer!"
1,i pick up this book...,at the times that i want to be fantastically bored. the characters are like the actors in an infomercial.
1,"Shame, really...","Johnson's characters were, without exception, deeply misogynistic, two-dimensional and immature. Nothing wrong with having *some* characters be so narrow-minded (such folks exist in real life), but universality of those qualities suggests to me that Johnson himself holds those qualities...this sure doesn't encourage me to read anything else he's written. In fact, I now avoid his books like the plague and gave away this book at a garage sale. (It's a shame I have to give this book even one star to get this review posted.) I am so glad that there *are* men who *are* able to regard women as dynamic, three-dimensional, capable of thought, and *human.* I'll read their books! There's no need to de-humanize another group of people to write well!"
4,Hypnotic and Sad,"I love it when readers try to analyze a writer. To call someone arrogant or to say that he was trying to be ""ultra-smart"" cracks me up; as if they ""know"" what the writer was intending.But then again, I don't understand anyone who says that this book was boring. I truly couldn't put it down; it was extremely good. I finished it with a strange sensation; similar to when I read THE MAGUS by John Fowles. I've never read any of Johnson's poetry, and only one short story, but I did enjoy this book.I want to point out that many aspects were very similar to Norman Mailer's TOUGH GUYS DON'T DANCE, a crime-drama. Pick that one up if you dug this one."
2,Not His Best Work,"DJ is in Jesus Son at the top of his game, his prose angellic, his stories compelling and concise. Already Dead starts out strong but it is as if DJ has not yet mastered the long form. His sprawling plot twists into itself and the main characters like Fairchild and Van Ness become less interesting. Frankenstein is the only character who remains strong and original. Most people who have never read his other stuff might be impressed by his impressive turns of phrase, but unfortunatley Already Dead like Resuscitation of a Hanged Man turns out to be ill-concieved and at its best a beautiful mess. But I have faith DJ will turn out a simple novel similar to Jesus' Son, b/c poetic clarity and concise story telling is where his power lies."
4,Already Dead,"An excellent book, but not really on par with Johnson's best work. I'd recommend starting with JESUS' SON, then ANGELS, the FISKADORO. Then if you're still interested, give ALREADY DEAD a shot. ALREADY DEAD is basically a modernized version of the epic poem, put into prose and supplemented with healthy doses of novelistic digressions and embellishments in stream-of-consciousness form. Johnson's gift for language is strong as ever here, with plot and structure as more of an after thought. If James Joyce had hailed from California instead of Ireland, he might have written this book instead of ULYSSES and FINNIGAN'S WAKE."
3,I wanted to love it,"That's maybe the hardest thing to chew on. I really wanted to love this book, but by page 304 (where I sit), despite the endless radiating beauty of the language, I succumb to my need for something to grasp on to. Plot is not the most important thing a novel needs, in my opinion, but the structure here seems, at times, confusing for confusings' sake. If you like Johnson, even just a little bit, try this on for size. You may love it, you may not. I appreciate this book, and much of the writing is downright quotable, but the Johnson of Stars At Noon and Angels (and the hopefully not-too-much-longer delayed Tree of Smoke; heard him read from this; nnnnnnice) is the best."
3,Ok...,"This is the first review I've written, but I felt I had to throw my two cents in about this book. This book moves REALLY slowly, if your someone who likes a plot to capture you from the first couple pages (even chapters) this isnt it. I agree with all the reviews on one point, his prose is excellent. Very poetic, but this book was tough to get through. I normally rifle through books fairly quickly because they caputer me and keep me wanting more. With Already Dead I felt I had to force myself to keep going, hoping it would get better. The book is good, but its just too slow for me. I did make it to the end and am happy to have it on my bookshelf. Thats pretty much all I have to say. Its not a bad book in the least, but not my cup of tea."
4,a near miss,there is a lot to like in this novel but not enough to recommend it without reservation. many passages are great while some others fall flat. denis johnson is always worth a read but this one is not on the same level as his best works.
4,Great Gloves - With Limitations,"I purchased these gloves initially for automotive work. They worked wonderful, were very comfortable and had great dexterity. I replaced a clutch in my vehicle with these on and never had to take them off to start or pick up a bolt. I used them for months doing various automotive tasks, loved 'em.The problem I ran into was that when I was doing a lot of work with stone I destroyed the fingertips very quickly, one day to be exact. Until they wore out I had used them for numerous things shoveling, driving gloves, moving..... you name it. They worked great for whatever I needed them for, except for stone work."
5,Needed for replacement,I purchase this item to repalce a 25 foot cable for my eliminator control since it was not long enough and the quality is good for the price I paid for now I don't have any problems with it but I guess time will tell.
5,So vivid you'll think you're there!,"Smoky Trudeau is a wonderful writer with a gift for description. Sitting down to read her debut novel, Redeeming Grace, I was transported to the early twentieth century along the banks of the Choptank River. I could hear the calls of birds and taste the food Grace served her family with the same energy and dedication that she applied to fighting the demons that attacked her loved ones. This is a story of life, death and redemption that I won't soon forget.I highly recommend this book."
5,"The best ""Making Out"" book I've read yet.","I've read all 12 of the ""Making Out"" books that are out so far, and this is the best one. If I had to pick one book from the series to live with for the rest of my life, this would be it. The plot is captivating and steady, and it really held my attention throughout the book. I consider this book the turning point in the ""Making Out"" series. The island kids go skiing in Killington, and problems are started and solved. A great book. Claire is my favorite character. Zoey seems so naive and stupid compared to her."
5,No Bull,"I stopped drinking after I read this book. He tells it like it is. I felt like he was talking directly to me and you would too if you have a drinking problem. It's not necessarily a how to book. More of a ""look at what you are doing to your life and do you want to keep doing it and suffer or do you want to quit and live?"" I read the book two years ago and I wasn't ready to quit but I didn't toss it because I knew what he was saying was true. I read it again six months ago and got some help and quit. Also, it's not an AA is the only way book. I guess it is the most important book I've ever read."
3,Not all sweet in Candyland.,"The highly anticipated debut album from Mic-C was one that was of dissapointment. Mic C is known for creating a heated tag team with label mate Hollow Tip. But in this album we find that Mic-C lacks creativeness that we expect from him. Don't get me wrong. This is not a bad album by any means. Hollow Tip, Young Ridah, and Dame make their usual appearances on a High Side release. These tracks are slammin. Then a duet with Slim Loc 1 begins to close out the album nicely. The real dissapointment for me was the production. There wasn't many songs to ride to. More of a laid back style than what we should expect. If you a Sacramento rap fan, go ahead and pic it up. If you looking to blown away, you might pass it up."
3,Nice moments but.......,"I prefered 'Off the record', which was more street. I like Norman Brown and Ronny Jordan, for different reasons. Ronny normally more street, where as this album, to me, seems to want to go over into Norman's territory. Fav cuts, Night and day, and Heaven."
5,Ronny Jordan is a Phenomenon as a guitar player!!!!,"The last track is Awesome!!! Ronny keep that way, God bless you."
5,Excellent presentation,"I must assume if you are interested in this item, you are familiar with Thich Nhat Hanh and his Buddhist teachings. I read almost all of his English publishing, but this is the first DVD on his teaching. I consider the mindful movement exercises are just as important as his written words and verbal teaching. It is a gem, but remember, I am part of the choir."
2,Not what I expected,I actually took some time to read past reviews on this DVD and thought it was what I was looking for.. but it wasnt. Its only 30 minutes long. There is one set of movements an English teacher talks through and then Thich Nhat Hanh talks through the same set of movements. Then its over! I was under the impression Thich Nhat Hanh spoke more on Buddhism but aside from a few sentences he did not. You need to mute the sound in order to focus and relax to the exercise bc there is talking the whole time.
4,Mindful Movements,Received in a timely manner. Thich Nhat Hanh's books and meditative movements are very helpful when dealing with the stress and trauma and sufferings of life. I do not believe I could be as compassionate as he is after enduring what he endured. He is an example of one to strive to be like in addition to Christ.
3,Mindful monks,"The video was okay. The tree movement distracted rather than enhanced. Brother Michael was an excellent leader, although some of the other monks needed to be more mindful in following him."
4,Excellentish,"It's true, it's no You Forgot it in People, but even that still gives room for it to be great. Songs like: 7/4 Shoreline, Major Lable Debut, and Windsurfing Nation, with guest Canadian rapper K-Os are the greater of the 13 excellent songs written by these 17 Canadian musicians. Only thing, could have used more Emily <3"
5,Goosebumps = Good stuff,"I'm brand new to Broken Social Scene, and I credit iTunes for providing the samples that led to my decision to pick this up. For one, I'm a big fan of Metric, and when I heard ""Swimmers,"" I instantly recognized the lovely Emily Haines' vocals, and was already 3/4 sold. By the time I'd heard all the samples, I was ready to get the record. I found the compositions to strike the same vein as Radiohead (stop with your comments already); let's just say when I get goosebumps listening to music there's something more cerebral going on than just another Top 40 mega-production.Not sure why there are no samples here (yet?) iTunes has the samples, but buy the record elsewhere; the artists make more royalty and iTunes limits your sound quality to their compressed format (AAC), so if your a purist and want the best quality you can get, well, you get my point.Goosebumps..."
4,One of a kind Group!,"Love the sound of this band. Though some of the lyrics are a bit explicit, they have an incredible, unique sound."
3,good....not great,"You Forgot it in People was a fantastic album. That one gets five stars. I actually think that it was the best album released in 2003/2004.So if YFIIP gets five stars what does this get? 3 at best. It's a good album. You should buy it if you like BSS. But five stars? Um.....no.Most of the people who wrote those five star reviews are probably Canadians. They get excited quite easily. It's not their fault. They mean well. But I mean really.....if YFIIP is a five star album....which I think it is....this one isn't. Even the people who wrote the five star reviews (with songs getting 12/10 - what an idiot) would agree that this album just isn't nearly as good as YFIIP.Again, good album, buy it, but don't expect too much."
4,If you're tired of the same old thing..,"This is the only Broken Social Scene CD I own, so I won't try to compare it to previous albums. I can however, compare it to other music that is floating around out there. If you're looking for something that isn't like the usual Fall Out Boy or Beyonce Knowels which seems to dominate the radio these days, this is your group. It's very unique and each song is truly all its own. It also has very good use of instrumentation, deviating away from the common guitar, bass, and drumset (with the occasional keyboard). Where with many bands you will find a similar sound and almost the same melody in some cases, this is not so with this album. Along with there being more than one main vocalist, not all the songs follow the usual verse, chord, verse. There is a different structure, different sound, different everything. The lyrics are profound most of the time, some of them are a little bizarre, but what fun would they be otherwise?"
4,worth it.,"It definately no 'You Forget It In People,' but it won't disappoint. You still get the amazing vocals of Amy Millan from Stars on several tracks but this album is more free and abstract than 'You Forget It In People' but less abstract than 'Feelgood Lost.'14 songs on the album, and it comes with a 7 song ep.It's worth more than you will pay for it. Buy it."
4,BSS ups the ante with one of the strongest releases of the year,"Eagerly anticipated, the follow-up to 'You Forgot It In People' equals, if not outshines it's predecessor in musical vision and brilliance. Broken Social Scene self-titled is a symphonic rock treat, combining infectious hooks, driving beats, and instrumentals that are weaved together like fabric, textures that are both exquisitely delicate yet ambitious. Much of the same from Broken Social Scene, orchestral grandiosity, atmospheric/ambient nuances, propulsive rhythms, with splashes of indie-rock like colours on a canvas. Symphonic choruses, experimental with strong hooks, beautiful arrangements, an all over the map approach that will most likely result as one of the strongest CD's of 2005. The future of music has arrived, in the form of Broken Social Scene."
2,Lost! Wrong Direction!,"Their other 2 albums were great. Trippy, very creative music that you could just lay down on the couch by yourself and daydream to. I was excited to see that they were coming to NYC and wondered how they would transfer that to the stage. Live, they came off as much more aggressive and overdriven than their recorded music. And what did they need all those people for? There were between 9 and 12 people playing and jumping around and stuff, but you tell what any of them were playing. Anyway I bought this one before the show and was disappointed to hear that it was pretty much the same song oriented, straitforward alternative rock that they played. This might be a good album, but don't try to relax with it or get stoned. Too bad. But I still have the other 2 that I can get off on."
2,Merely a Copy of the Previous,"By now Broken Social Scene could record the sound of their own farts and release it as a record on Arts & Crafts, and all the critics and hipsters would oooooh and aaaaaah it. That's the problem with being the ""darling"" of indie music: it's easy to fall in a trap.The problem is the new record is nothing but a copy of ""You Forgot It in People"" but done half as good. While objectively, this is not a terrible recording, I was expecting so much more from a band that I see as innovators. Better luck next time, Broken Social Scene."
1,THESE GUYS ARE JUST SUCKING!,"WHAT A WASTE OF TIME....NOT EVEN GOOD FILLER, JUST SAPPY CRAP THAT THEY MUST THINK IS CLEVER...EVEN THE STUFF THAT IS CLOSE TO DECENT IS JUST REHASHED NOTES THAT GAVE THEM AN INITIAL LISTEN..THEY JUST HAVE FALLEN FLAT ON THEIR FACE.. MUST BE DUE TO RESTRICTED IMAGINATION,CREATIVITY RETARDATION AND AND SELF-IMPORTANCE ILLUSION...DON'T WASTE YOUR $ OR TIME WITH THIS POPPY GARBAGE....HOW THE WEAK HAVE FALLEN."
5,Amazing,"I don't usually write reviews however the person who said that they couldn't stand the second track on the album pushed me to it. That track is my favourite (one of anyway) on the album and is often listed as among BSS' best, so this guy obviously doesn't have ears. And the fact that you would skip the first track because you don't like the second? Possibly the most retarded thing I have ever had to read.Anyway, BSS are different to most other stuff you will hear. It took me quite a few listens to really get this album, it doesn't follow one theme throughout like most albums but their sound seems to change. They take you through brass instrumental sections (great on Our Faces..) to anthems (Ibi Dreams of Pavement) to emotional epics (It's All Gonna Break). I can't recommend this album anymore than just saying try it because once it clicks with you, it will become one of your favourite albums."
5,Absolutely a Masterpiece,"Broken Social Scene's self-titled album is quite the treat and/or pleasure! From the very first track (Our Faces Split the Coast in Half) the listener begins a superfantastic musical ride that is sure to please. The tracks that stand out the most for me are ""7/4 (Shoreline)"" with with the vocal stylings of Feist, ""Swimmers"", also featuring Feist, ""Fire Eyed Boy"", ""Superconnected"", and ""Handjobs for the Holidays"", which is a song that cannot easily be described. It's like setting in the middle of the universe. That is the best way I can describe it. This album being as good as it is may even rival the band's earlier effort: You Forgot it in People. Which is one of my top 10 albums of all time. This BSS album definately ranks in my top 10 too, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes good music. I know some people that don't like it, but they are too busy listening to Nickelback, so they probably just like bad music I guess."
2,LOTS OF SUGAR,"This has a TON of sugar in it. I don't recall seeing anything indicating the amount of sugar, or I would mnot have bought it. Fruit is already sweet..I don't get putting all this extra sugar in it. This is MORE than extra. I love fruit preserves, & have purchased many brands....but none of them had this much sugar in them. I don't buy sugar free, either. These preserves are more like a jelly..I didn't see any fruit chunks in them.Yes, it's tasty, but if you tend to have high blood sugars, like me, stay away from it. Any other preserve will have less sugar than this."
3,A Good Preschool Introduction to the Characteristics of Snow,"This is a straightforward introductory science book intended for preschoolers. In it, the author describes some characteristics of snow (for example, snowflakes have six sides, they fall from clouds, and can be either powdery or wet) and its qualities (for example, it insulates the ground and can be used to make igloos, but can also be dangerous).The text is readable and understandable for young explorers, and the illustrations are adequate, but not memorable. It engagingly invites children to interact with the element while providing larger categories for them to think about it. This makes an excellent public library checkout to build on (or prepare them for) direct experience with snow."
5,LOVE THIS FAN!,"I really love this fan. We have it on our newly covered screened in porch and it works great, its pretty quiet and looks good. I was nervous about getting an outdoor fan but this was a wonderful choice. Just be sure that when you unpack it from its box that you do it carefully. We hired someone to install it and when they originally unpacked it they were not careful and they broke the glass. I had to get another one shipped to me. When we got the new one, we were much more careful. I highly recommend it and its a good price too!"
1,Rusty in 3 months,"I ordered two fans for a covered porch. We do live on a river, however I did not expect them to rust so soon. Within 3 months the fans were rusting and within 6 months one of the fan's lights stopped working. I have gotten nowhere with customer service. After speaking to them many times they transferred my case to quality control. I was told they would call me - never happened. When I called them my claim wasn't even in the computer. I think they're hoping I simply go away. Horrible customer service - warranty means nothing. I truly regret buying these fans!"
2,Outdoor Ceiling Fan,The fan motor makes a lot of noise. Not sure if it is defective or it is suppose to be this loud.
3,Caveat emptor,"Before reading Irving, you would be wise to read his critics --- or read the opinion of the conservative British judge who ruled against Irving in his libel action against Penguin Books. He was found by the court to be a Nazi apologist who repeatedly misrepresented source documents to validate his revisionist history of Hitler and the Third Reich. (In speeches to hate groups in Germany and the US, he used to joke that ""more people died in the back seat of Edward Kennedy's car at Chappaquidick than died in the gas chambers at Auschwitz."") In an early edition of the Dresden book, he claimed that 202,040 people were killed in the Allied firebombing. The number, it turns out, was derived by simply adding a zero to the official German count of 20,204. Before you buy this book, consider whether you want to pay royalties to such a man."
4,A Good Balance of History,"This book by sometimes controversial, but always worthwhile, English historian David Irving is a credible attempt on his part to balance a bit of the history of World War II. My research of this author has proven him to be as generally reliable as any other noted historian. His only sin is to try to present a more balanced view of both sides of a tragic war. Although I do not agree with everything that he writes, it certainly does not make him anti-semitic. That epithet should be saved for the true hatemongers who deserve it. To throw the term about loosely only diminishes its gravity."
1,One word TERRIBLE,"I had some respect for No Limit, but not anymore. This album by Master P is very weak. The beats are very similar to everything else, and the lyrics are very very weak."
1,Id give this cd 0 stars if it wuz possible,"Wut is this? A r&b compilation? This must be worst no limit release next to Made Man. Almost all these tracks seem like recycled junky noise slaped together, i listened to this cd and wuz glad i didnt buy this trash. P has nuthin 2 really talk about anymore, hes richer than most people and duznt live in the ghettos anymore. Give up the rap business and retire. Im gone with C-Murder's new record company. Peace"
1,BITER!,COME ON NOW P WHATS NEXT?ALL EYEZ ON ME DAMN STOP COPYING PAC CUZ PAC IS THE REAL DON NOT U. YOU CAN'T EVEN HOLD HIS JOCKSTRAP! WESTSIDE 4 LIFE!
1,I USED TO B YOUR FAN BUT DO U NO WHAT HAPPINED!,I USED TO LOVE THE TANK BACK IN 97 BUT MORE IN MORE I ALLWAYS THOUGHT THAY WHERE COPYING PAC AND AFTER C_MURDERS SECOUND CD I SEEN IT WAZ TRUE><><HE COPYED PACS UNRELEASED SONG WHEN WE RIDE ON ARE ENIMES<><>AND THEN THIS I HOPE SOME ONE PUTS A SLUG TO ALL DEM BITERS CHESTS THEN P CAN GO C HIS DEAD BRO!
5,only the haters couldn't like this cd,"for real this is P's best work yet, and this definitely doesn't sound like every other no limit cd, this has got some tight a$$ songs, like ""ghetto honeys"", ""da ballers"", ""step to dis"", ""return of da don"", ""ya'll don't want none"", ""where do we go from here"", and actually every other song, they're all tight, no limit is back on top to stay, hoody hoooo! no limit forever, biaaaaatch!"
3,NOT THE GREATEST BY FAR,I BOUGHT THIS CD THINKING THAT P WOULD OUT SHINE ALL THE OTHERS IN HIS ARMY.B.B.T.P NEEDS TO COME BACK FOR P'S SAKE.P NAME WILL SELL THE C.D AND A THE FEW SONGS HE DID WITH THE UP AND COMMING STAR IF PROMITED RIGHT D.I.G. THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC
2,Its apparent MP has been out of the bidness for a few years,"I don't see this CD being up to Master P's standards. I have been a tru No Limit Fan forever. I own all Master P CDs... and this is the worst. It contains little new catchy content, and probably no hit-worthy tracks. Only the most die-hard NO LIMIT fans should buy this cd, only to see that MP's comeback is far from the excellence that he has achieved in the past."
2,AVERAGE----2.5 STARS,"This album is average. It has 4 songs that i really like (ghetto prayer, ice on my wrist, ghetto in the sky and boonapalist). all the songs are worth listening to, but aren't great. i bought it for $8.99 Australian dollars so i wouldn't refund it, but if it's more than $18 its not worth it. if u want a good master p album get goodside/badside, gameface or ghetto d."
2,MASTER P's WEAKEST,"THIS ALBUM COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD, BUT IT WAS'NT. I ONLY LIKED THREE TRACKS ON THE WHOLE CD TRACKS 3,4,8. HE NEEDS TO RELEASE THAT GREATIST HITS ALBUM AND THE 504 BOYZ TO REALLY SHOWCASE HIS TALENT."
1,Maybe There IS a Limit to Master P's Career!,"After listning to what was garbage of a surprisingly dissapointing album, I decided to give it at least one star, because 0 stars weren't available. Master P, I honestly can say that U betta whip into shape, before Cash Money becomes the new army of the south!"
1,Has Master Percy reached the limit?,"The colonel promised to retire and let's hope he is now. This album really proves Master P's lack of skills, one time for all. He is a business man and I got mad respect for the way he has built the No Limit empire, but still rappin' is about skills on the mic... This album contains boring and uninteresting beats as well as wack lyrics. The sound(artist and Carlos Stephens etc.) is still much the same now, even though Beats By The Pound has left the camp. There is one track that works, ""Da Ballers"" features So So Def founder Jermaine Dupri and his baby voice and quality production makes you wanna dance. Still this album is a useless release and it's already forgotten."
1,i just don't get it,"Everyone I know likes Master P so I thought that I would buy a cd and see if it was any good. It was not good at all. It is trash. P's got no flow, bad beats, and terrible production. It sounds like this disk was recorded in a basement in a day or two. I can't think of anything good to say about it. All of the songs sound the same with that awful noise that is P's voice, and the beats sound like they were made by a little kid. And what is up with P and Tupac. P never knew Tupac, and if they would have known each other, Tupac would have just had another person to slam in ""Hit Em Up"". Don't bother with this cd or any other music out of No Limit exept Mystikal. Do your self a favour and buy the new Tupac cd ""Still I Rise"" instead."
1,HOW LONG WILL U TORTURE US,I Suggestz To MP the names for his Next LPz -R U Still Down - That title will show that U Have great respect to 2PAC;;;;;;; -NoLimtChronic2002 - Alway to stay it touch with latest Dope Beats (of course only the name will try sell you shyt);;;;;;; AND ONE MORE THING PLS keep your ugly voice out of the next SNOOP album
2,Master P can do better than this.,P needs to focus his attention on his music again. I couldnt find one good single. I'm from N.O. and usually bias for hometown artist but not this time
3,3.5 Stars,"This definitely isnt the best to come from NoLimit although mediocre at times this is still a very good album, I believe this is the last good NoLimit album everything since this in my opinion has been way below the bar they set in the 90's when they basically ruled the rap world and with the NoLimit/CashMoney wars it was amazing, I think Ca$hMoney came out on top on that but of course now CashMoney has fell off also so in my opinion there really isnt anybody on top anymore its just a bunch of guys thinking they are. But back to subject this is a decent release and I can still pop it in and listen every now and then but its not very consistent to me but still worth picking up."
1,very corny,he isn't a rapper or a good actor.this disc just is as bland as the rest of no-limit and cash money.i mention the two of them cuz it all sounds the same just the names are different.master p has the ughh thang but what else? the music has always been corny.p&puffy have become successful business men i give them that but it has nothing to do with good music.
1,WHAT A WASTE!,I've heard better music coming out of an elevator. What was MP thinking? The lyrics were terrible and there wasn't anything to move by.
2,Not good enough,"I can't believe I'm saying this. However, I'm beginning to like No Limit(Even though they have no talent). So that's why I am giving this CD a little better than just one star. The problem is that No Limit has nothing to say in their albums, they talk about the same thing over and over and over again. A good example is this CD. Aprroximately 4 of the songs in the CD are about Haters and the rest aren't any better. The only good song in the album is Who Down To Ride( I LOVE D.I.G.! Flows are tight as hell! ). I do have regrets buying this. If I should buy another NL CD. It would either MAC, Mystikal, D.I.G., or Fiend. They are actually the only rappers that has talent in the Tank.(But you gotta get TRU 2 DA GAME! That's the best No Limit CD ever! )"
2,he's right...,"only god can judge him, and from the number of records No Limit sold after this release, I'd say God says enough garbage from you Master P."
3,"Not Terrible, but come on Master P","This album by Master P and the rest of the no limit crew is not as dominant as they would like it to be. The album tries but just is not there. True, it has some decent joints. But for the rest of the joints, give me a break. Master P tries to imitate 2 Pac in this album, but can not. A few of the cuts are just horrible. Master P is just trying to dam hard. He needs to relax and stop all the talk how no limit rules the world. The album just barely makes it in the "" just fair "" level, but Master P needs to do better with his next project or else no limit will have no people. I would give this 2 and a half stars but I couldn't so I gave it a three instead of a two, eventhough I really shouldn't have."
3,THIS CD WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED,"There were only about 8 good songs on this album which is ok. The beats just down sound the same, having no bass at all. Sometimes it sounds the same. He had weak as people like dupri and nas, that song wasn't tight at all, that boonapalist sh@t was stupid and crazy about ya. The track get yo mind right would have been ok if it wasn't for the chorus. The tracks were too short. The most quality songs you can get out of here is,Life aint easy, Step to dis, Ice on my wrist( which is on magic's album), lyrics were tight in nobody moves, Y'all dont wont none and the (intro) Only god can judge me good. What the hell is this sh@t OH NA NAE. The only No Limit album I'm lookin forward to is C-murder's TRAPPED IN CRIME. Over all this cd deserves a 2 1/2."
3,Aight,"Okay P, what is up with your new album? I mean all his other albums were so great and now he has to drop something like this? I am a die-hard No Limit fan, but why does you have to copy off Tupac?"
1,Look Elswhere,"Mix quality is random (vocal blend especially.) The best thing I can say about this collection is that disc 3 is considerably better than 1 and 2. The psuedo-live/pub feel of most songs just comes off as silly. Most songs seem to feature only accordian and drum (and singer), so unless you want to hear lots of accordian music, stay away from this one.Songs not featuring the accordian are still woefully short of instruments, as if all the flute and guitar players were on holiday when this was being recorded. It's not a lack of musicianship as much as a total lack of musicians. This album's depth is exceeded by its CD's thickness. Replay value is somewhere below zero: don't even buy it used.Additional note: this appears to be identical to Irish Favorites, Vol. 1, except for the addition of the third disc."
4,Amazing,If you are a fan of this movie the Blu-ray edition is a must have. The deleted scenes are fantastic.
3,3.5,"Backdraft is a good movie on many levels, but Baldwin is just painful to watch. A better actor would have really gotten this movie where it wanted to go. Kurt Russell was awesome in his role as Bull and De Niro as Shadow was also very good. Sutherland's pyromaniac performance had a real Silence of the Lambs feeling to it. Scott Glenn was also fantastic in his role. He is really under-rated as an actor and should get bigger roles than he does. Some of the big firefighting scenes were laughable compared to the action scenes you would see today, but the fight scenes were all great."
2,"Spectacular action scenes, insincere drama","BACKDRAFT(USA - 1991)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)Theatrical soundtracks: 6-track Dolby Stereo / Q SoundTwo firefighting brothers (Kurt Russell and William Baldwin) are forced to confront the ghosts of their past whilst pursuing an arsonist who targets prominent members of Chicago's political elite.Former TV actor Ron Howard (""Happy Days"") directed this high-profile Hollywood blockbuster, in which a cast of solid B-list actors and A-list supporting players (Robert DeNiro, Donald Sutherland, et al) are upstaged by scenes of fiery devastation, wrought with frightening intensity by incredible stuntwork and state-of-the-art visual effects. Plot-wise, the film is an old-fashioned barnstormer, directed with gee-whizz efficiency by Howard, whose attempts to wring high emotion from Greg Widen's corny script rings entirely false from the outset. Hans Zimmer's generic music score is overbearing in places, particularly during the 'tragic' finale."
3,this movie is ok,i like this movie i found it good my dad who is a new york city fire man (NOT a volenteer hes a real fire man) showed me that it was kinda corney the people always ran in to the fire with there jacket wide open (which if you did that in real life youd be dead in 2 seconds) it had a prety good story to it thought they never wore there oxegen masks thats what made this movie corney i didnt like one of the names of the fire man his name was john adcox he always ran into a fire always useing the hose in slow motion like james bond's moves he must of fought over the hose like a baby becuase he always got it this movie is kinda worth it.
3,Brainless fun. And the fires are incredible.,"I'm a snotty intellectual and usually turn my nose up at films like this, but a sinus headache made me skip the art films and look for something with light and noise that I wouldn't have to think about. The night before I had make a mistake with ""The (pretentious) Abyss,"" but this time I chose right. It's loud and fun and never tries to pretend it's something it isn't. The brother stuff got me, and it made me wish that good old Kurt Russell would get an A-list role every once in a while. I had a blast."
5,DVD,DVD and case was in good shape.. Received it in a reasonable amount of time. Very happy with the purchase
5,Great Movie,"Stunning flame effects, good storyline and even a twist at the end! Always liked this movie and suggest it to anyone who likes Kurt Russel or Firefighters."
5,Classic,"I have loved this movie since I was 7 years old when it was released. This film is a great action thriller, well acted (for the most part), with a fast paced story. As a firefighter, I have to say this is one of the most unrealistic firefighting movies, but if you can check your mind at the door and not criticize how technically wrong the firefighting aspects are, then you can really enjoy the movie. The story revolves around two brothers whose family is rich in firefighting tradition, woven into the story about an arsonist terrorizing Chicago. I would recommend this movie to anyone, and especially firefighting buffs (but you've probably already seen it)."
2,backdraft review,"I enjoyed the movie, except for the fact that it wasn't full screen on my computer. If i had know this, i wouldn't have bought it. Sorry"
1,Disappointed,This is the first time that I have ordered that my tape would not play...If I had the information I would send it back...Disappointed!
3,Okay but not as good as LADDER 49,"I am a fire buff and I enjoy firefighters but this movie isn't as good as LADDER 49 because some of the firefighters didn't wear their SCBAs (Self Contained Breathing Apparatus). Also, Kurt Russell's coat wasn't buttoned all the way up. The trucks used in the movie are Engine 17 (1970 Ward LaFrance) Engine 24 (1978 American LaFrance)Truck 46 in the opening (1976 International Harvester with a Seagrave tiller trailer) truck 46 in the later parts of the movie (1972 Mack CF with customized lights) Truck 6 (1970s American LaFrance ladder truck) and Engine 51 (also a 1970 Ward LaFrance).The fire used in this is digital and it doesn't look right in fire movies and Jay Russell tried using digital fire and so he had to use real fire in Ladder 49. Also, when Ron Howard made this movie he made things go overtime and almost burn Kurt Russell. I saw the making of it on a Ron Howard The Directors video."
5,Backdraft,This movie was a gift for someone else. They loved it. It was a movie they had been trying to purchase for a long time. It was a great suprise.
2,Good suspense and drama keeps one focused on the action.,"Both my wife and I were in suspense throughout the film. At the end my wife even cried. We had just bought a DVD player and picked this as our first movie. Unfortunatly, We did not check its rating. Too late we found that there was heavy use of four-letter words like f-ing, and GD. That did away any desire to see it again. I cannot recommend it because of its excessive use of profanity."
3,Hollywood-itis,"I am usually a big fan of Ron Howard's films. He has directed some of my favorite movies over the past few years. ""Parenthood, Apollo 13, the Paper"". But unfortunately, Howard succumbed to what I consider ""Hollywood-itis"" with this film. This is taking subject matter that is inherently dramatic and interesting, and yucking it up with too many sub-plots and other distracting story elements. He could have stuck with the fire mystery, the De Niro and Sutherland characters and cut out all the other junk and still had a good movie. The movie is recommended for the great fire effects though."
5,Awesome.,"Loved the movie, wanted some HD DVDs for my player.Plays great, brand new in case.I greatly recommend this movie."
1,I was very disappointed!,"Sorry I was unhappy with this DVD - it will not play on anything. I get a quote that says: ""playback is prohibited"""
1,A Techno Bust,"A poor representation of modern firefighting! Even Kurt Russel's lungs would be seared by the heat and toxic fire gases generated in the ""save my baby"" scene where he races to the top of the stairs and into the burning room. The portrayal of a backdraft as a sinister beast is but one of many technically flawed representations in this flick."
2,Backdraft,"The maid DVD is scratched.The movie is excellant, but I was quite disappointed in the quality of this 'NEW' DVD."
2,Skip it.,Dreadful. Waste of time. De Niro's completely wasted. What on earth was Ron Howard thinking? What on earth was DE NIRO thinking?
3,A Fair Ron Howard film,"I like this film. It has good points and low points. I like the special effects and the research of the gases and also how the fire department works. However towards the middle and end the special effects weaken some of the acting. Althought it had a great director and a great cast. Dir:Ron Howard. Cast:William Baldwin Robert DeNiro Donald Sutherland Scott Glen Jennifer Jason Lee Clint Howard and Kurt Russel. Ron Howard directs this tale about two brothers in the same unit of the fire department as their dad was. Kurt Russel does a perfect job as The older Brother. William Baldwin does a good job as Ryan Mcaffy(The younger Brother). Robert DeNiro brings once again is best to the story as the arson investigator. Donald Sutherland springs his crazy philosophy of fire as a former arsonist. Scott Glenn who I think was the best in this movie,does a great job. Also Clint Howard Rons younger brother appears in the intruiging film. Check out the ride at Universal studios"
3,this is commercial,"this is a 1980s album,it is straight foward with good energy but thats about it,not very innovative for purple and no mystery to it.there were alot of bands looking to find them selfselves, they were on this disc and they did not come close.the critics got this wrong on this one. dont believe the hype,solid rock and roll no more no less"
2,"I USED TO LIKE IT , BUT NOW I DON'T","I bought this album at once, back in 1986. AS most Purple fans, I was anxious to have this album featuring their best line-up. I listened to it and I loved it. But after a while, thinking with my head and not my heart, I realised this is not a good album at all, except for ""KNOCKING AT YOUR BACK DOOR"" (a classic in rock forever), ""PERFECT STRANGERS"", ""UNDER THE GUN"" and ""GYPSY'S KISS"". The rest are fillers, pure fillers."
4,Get the polydor cd release...,"Just got this album in the mail and it is perfect. Mk 2 reunite on this album and they made a great comeback here. As for the cd, I ordered the polydor release off amazon and it sounds very warm. All the instruments can be heard perfect, and when you turn it up it doesn't sound annoying. If you want to buy this on cd, DO NOT GET THE REMASTER. People think ""Remastered"" means it is better sound quality, but that is a lie(or maybe just my opinion)but the remasters sound like crap. If you like Deep Purple or good classic heavy metal and rock music you should get this album."
4,Welcome back,"This one has some really strong songs on it. Dp had been split up for a long while and even longer from the most popular version of Mk .2. So this was very exciting to listen to for the first time . The guys didn't disappoint either ,especially on the first half of the album . I do not think this is as good as their early 70's stuff but it was one of the most awesome albums of its own time, still not afraid to stick to their own style when all the newer music of the time sounded so much diffrent."
4,The classic lineup returns.,"This is the Deep Purple lineup that most people are familiar with. But, this album doesn't bring back all the magic. The title track and ""Knockin At Your Back Door"" are two classic songs. But, the rest of the album is hit and miss. This is not Machine Head or Fireball material, but it is good and that classic Purple sound can still rock."
4,ONE OF THEIR GREATESTS!,"THIS, IN MY OPINION IS ONE OF THE BEST PURPLE ALBUMS. IAN GILLAN IS AT HIS GREATESTS, THOUGH THE BACKGROUND IS NOT THE SAME AS IN THEIR OLDER STUFF. LONG LIFE TO GILLAN, ONE OF THE BEST VOCALS IN METAL HISTORY"
3,Wishing for more,"When this came out back in 1984 (I can't believe it's been 16 years! ) I rushed out and bought the thing. Having loved DP for years I couldn't wait to hear the Mark II lineup reunion. I might have been expecting too much, but I was a little disappointed. As far as I'm concerned there are only 3 songs worth listening to: Perfect Strangers, Knocking at Your Back Door, and Gypsy's Kiss. The rest seem like filler, sounding tired and unoriginal. I think this is worth getting if you're a Deep Purple fan, just don't expect too much. If you're looking for a a great DP CD, either go back to their earlier works (Machine Head, Made in Japan) or try their 1990 issue of ""Slaves and Masters"" which was one of the freshest sounding CD's they ever put out."
4,reunion of the the Hard Rock Dinosaurus in 1985.,"Perfect strangers 1985 was the continuing story after Come Taste the band album 1975, where the Deep Purple Mk IV at that time under the command of David Coverdale had been splited. This reunion album 1985 was a little bit commercial in the rock market, though the whole songs are not bad. I love the knocking at your back door, the album title, Gypsy kiss and of course Wasted sunsets. These songs are timeless.....Gillan and Blackmore Co still kept the old PURPLE sound, what they ever had done during their hey days in the early essential 70's. Buy this one! and also buy the next reunion album HOUSE OF THE BLUE LIGHT 1987. Long Live DEEP PURPLE in the Rock n roll hall of fame as the best Hard Rock in the highest rank."
4,A triumphant return for Deep Purple...,"...and sadly, their last real great album.By 1984, heavy metal rock was being largely dominated by bubble gum MTV hair bands like Quiot Riot, Ratt and the Scorpions (give me a break, will you!!!) Deep Purple managed to hold onto their heavy rock sound and image and score great tracks like ""Knockin' At Your Back Door"", ""Nobody Home"", ""Mean Streak"" and the title track."
4,Two different versions,"This was a nice effort for the reunion. Not every track is a gem, but the tracks Knocking at Your back Door, Under the Gun, and Perfect Strangers more than make up for the filler. Be careful though. The newer remaster does have Son of Alerik on it, which in my opinion is just an OK instrumental, but I actually prefer the mastering of the original version without that track. The newer remaster has a way hotter (annoying) top end which makes it more difficult to listen to."
3,Steady If Not Spectacular,"Whereas this album is full of many no-frills rock n roll songs, it does not compare to the band's watershed release, Machine Head. The guys reunited in 1984 and where there are a few synthesizer tricks here and there, for the most part this album is of the slam bam thank you maam variety. Knocking At Your Backdoor is probably the albums best track with a great rhythm, electrifying guitar solo, and spirited vocals. However little in the area of diversity exists on this release. Most of the songs trudge along at a fairly slow pace(Under The Gun and A Gypsies Kiss are the only exceptions. Basically this album is for established fans of the band."
4,great come back,very good recording from DP with there best line-up. must have for a Deep Purple fan
3,a very commercial reunion album 1985,"DP mark II line up is the best one of hard rock in history, this album is becoming a DP commercial symbol in the eighties,...though the songs aren't bad. I prefer the house of the blue light album 1986."
4,Deep Purple- Perfect Strangers,"Fantastic! A great ""come back"" release from a great vintage rock group. In my opinion, the best ""come back"" to date."
2,MEDIOCRE AT BEST,UNLIKE THE REAL PURE MOODS CDs WHICH FEATURE VARIOUS ARTISTS THIS SET DOES NOT.THERE ARE A FEW SONGS THAT SOUND PLEASENT BUT FOR THE MOST PART THEY ALL SOUND THE SAME.THE INCLUSION OF NATURE SOUNDS WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SOOTHING ARE MORE OF AN IRRITATION THAN ANYTHING ELSE.SAVE YOUR MONEY.
5,Very Nice Mix,"The fifth disk is a DVD with sound and video so it will not play in all CD players. Overall This set includes a very nice variety of musical sounds with nature sounds included with some, but not all tracks. I enjoyed the music but would not consider these songs to be of the very very relaxing type. Perhaps more of a medium relaxing style. Some tracks do have some musical action to them. Highly recommended if you are looking for a nice musical mix for background sound while working or playing. Solid production, mixing and songs on all of the 4 CDs."
4,Soothing New Age Music,"I enjoy this music, it's great for times of relaxation and when I go to sleep at night. It helps me to unwind at the end of the day. I recommend this box set to anyone who enjoys soothing music."
2,Nice Listening Music if the CD's play properly,I was disappointed in the CD's because the 5th CD in the grouping of 5 CD's doesn't play on my Bose CD player. I even tried to play it on another CD player without any luck. The first 4 CD's are quite nice to listen to.
3,one disc does not work,i like the cd's one does not work i am not sure why as the rest of them do. what can i do to get a replacement for the unworkable one? janice
1,Karoke,It sounds as though someon had bought the Cher karoke cd and had a party with a bunch of drunk girls. I don't normally write reviews but this one is bad!
1,Awful,"When I put in this CD and the first song started playing, I laughed. The versions on this CD are laughable. This is a really awful CD with people who try to copy Cher. If you want a collection of Cher's songs, they but Cher Gold. It is all of her hits, and sung by Cher herself. This is a waste of money."
4,An Interesting Read,"Although I don't really agree with any of the arguments Descartes has in this book, it is an interesting read that I would recommend for anyone."
1,Skip it,"Everyone told me how important this book was while I was in undergrad; I still don't see why. The book is unnecessarily hard to read and follow. He uses thousands of words, when a few short paragraphs will suffice. Even my professor admitted he had read it multiple times and still doesn't understand it completely. It's as if he thought being incomprehensible would give his ideas more clout; it actually just shows what a poor writer he was. Not a fan."
4,The Middle Sea: A history of the Mediterranean,"A very comprehensive and thorough review. Very well documented. It reads like a novel. The support information is excellent, very informative. Allways in context.English is my second language but the book is written in such a way, and the support is so good that very few times I could not fully understand a phrase or a situation depicted.The bibliography quite extensive. It gives you the oportunity to get deeper in any subject if you so desire."
4,Most informative,"This is a most informative, well-written book on the Mediterranean. From ancient Egypt to WWII, it tells of the many happenings in this middle sea. If you are going to travel the islands, this will add much to your journey."
2,"Synthesizer, Synthesizer, Synthesizer","And BAD synthesizer, at that. Please ! Real music and musicians. The backup singers sound great, though, and I may have actually heard a horn on Baby Love"
4,I love all things Pachelbel.,"I have a number of CD's with Pachelbel recordings, it is truly addictive. When I met the love of my life for the last 37 years, she introduced me to the ocean and I fell in love with it as well. This is the perfect marriage of the sounds of the ocean and Pachelbel.Additionally, there are some other relaxing sounds on the CD as well, but the Pachelbel is of course, my favorite."
3,A good film,"Jennifer Jones is always the good actress, but she is a little too old for her role in the film.I wonder why they chose Charlton Heston for this film. A more handsome guy should be more convincing. Anyway I think it a good entertaining film."
5,Ruby Gentry,I'm glad I finally found this movie again. I had seen it many years ago and found that it was just as entertaining this time around. Two great performers and good story line.
4,Angry hardcore - BUY it >:-],"Sorry but I agree with the original review (Wes) over the 2nd review (James) This is just a simple case of gauging your sensitivity level. I will quote the intro to Carnivore's song called Race War: ""This is the United States of America where you have the right to hate whoever you want."" There are multiple reasons to hate various cities and states of your choice (sports is a good one). Choke has been hardcore greatness all the way back to Negative FX (his best stuff ever) and to come out with this gem; it only solidifies himself in the hardcore hall of fame. His band Stars & Stripes is excellent too. If you like 16 Valve Hate or Old Tyme Hardcore then you can't go wrong here - that is unless you're easily offended. ""Rap Sucks"" is brilliant and that song rules. Now buy this and go hate a little ! Jay in Texas"
5,Vividly carrying readers through Margaret's violent abduction in broad daylight on one otherwise ordinary Monday morning,"Detour by Richard Meese is a catching and engaging suspense novel providing the reader with a romantic tale of the everyday, mundane frequency and predictability of Margaret Brady's routine existence -- and the one day which changed the entire rest of her life. Vividly carrying readers through Margaret's violent abduction in broad daylight on one otherwise ordinary Monday morning, Detour then throws her in the hands of her handsome rescuer, NSA agent, Steve Solo as they make their way to Switzerland where their potential love may ideally expand. A work of well crafted originality, Detour by Richard Meese is enthusiastically recommended to readers of general fiction, mystery, and romance."
5,Nice Follow up to the Best of Mister ED Vol 1. If you want a nice over view of the series this set is very nice.,Wonderful collection of episodes make it in Vol 2. Volume 2 gives us nice collection of shows spanning all 5 years. If you love Mr Ed and just want a nice collection of episodes in your collection this is a nice follow up to season Vol 1 but I would start with 1 first. If you want all of mister ed or something more complete I would suggest you by the complete seasons. But if you are looking for a nice overview of the show these sets are a great place to start.
3,A Horse is A Horse...,"and so is a ""season""! While ""Mr. Ed"" is a one of a kind classic no matter how you look at it, these wonderfully enchanting shows need to be season by season - not ""best of"". I bought this for my niece, 9, who is a horse fanatic and she loves it -- even in black and white!!! I also bought her the Volume 1 ""best of"". If not for my love of her and her love of horses, I would have passed. Sorry Ed!"
5,A must for Wicked lovers,"I read the book and saw the Broadway Play recently, so I was dying to get my hands on the Grimmerie. I was not disappointed. The photos are fabulous and all the information is even better. If you want to know all the behind-the-scene tricks of the play, more about the characters in the play, and how it was adapted from the book, then you definately need this book. My favorite part is the script in the back of the book. As a teacher, I plan on using the story along with the music to teach my kids about personal strength, friendship, and the consequences of bullying. I LOVE this book!"
4,The 2nd Bible (I give it really 4.5),"If you are a WICKED fan, this is your bible. Here are the goods:Pros:1. REALLY cool pictures, graphics and the cover2. How to do the 'Elphaba' from the Oz Dust ballroom3. How they make Elphaba greenCons:1. Not a full libertto (just because the book doesn't have that doesn't mean it should only get 1 star)2. The fan letters are stupid3. Spoilers (for when fans wh show their friends who haven't seen the show.)Otherwise, it is my second bible. :)"
1,Terrible,"The delivery took over two weeks and when it did arrive the entire binding was torn. I ordered the book as ""new"" so there was no reason for it to be in such terrible shape. Very disappointing since I wanted to give the book as a gift. Would never order anything from here again."
5,Wicked good book!,"My daughter and I love the musical, ""Wicked"". This book has beautiful photos of the musical, along with the entire script. Load of other fun things too!"
5,Populer- lar!!!!,"Fantastic book! My cousin bought it for me about a year ago, and to this day I find myself reading it over and over again, every time finding something new and interesting about ""Wicked"". I read the script provided in the book, and they even have the lyrics to the songs in green, so you know if the characters are singing or just talking. I find myself singing the songs out loud, while going through the scenes in my head! The colored pictures, are amazing and make me appreciate how much work goes into making such a successful musical and making it a truely unforgettable experience that will leave ""a handprint on your heart"". Great book.....BUY IT!!"
5,Wicked!,Love this book! It is a behind the scenecs look at Wicked. Beautiful photos in a wonderful book.
2,Great Product!!! - not great condition,"I absolutely love this book! It's fabulous! I'm normally very impressed with Amazon - their product selection, their fast and accurate billing and shipping, and the condition of the products when they arrive. This time, however, the book (which is hardcover) arrived with warped pages (like water damaged) and some of the pages are not very attached to the binding."
3,A dissapointment,"First off, I'm a fan of the musical, saw OBC, waiting in line for 5 days to get lotto tickets. So I'm a big fan.I was extreamly dissapointed. The main reason I buy these books is not for pictures of the cast (I was horrified to see the full page almost centerfold of Fyero) but for the entierty of the script. The hack job of the script almsot made me not want to get the book. The pictures are good and some of the information is very interesting.I was also annoyed by the blatent advertising. I don't need to know who played after OBC. Really, If they had spent more time on making the book better they wouldn't have needed filler information about the touring cast (information which will outdate the book in about one year!) At times it felt like an over blown program rather then a book.All in all, a good book if you really like the musical, or if you like looking at the pictures. but not if you haven't seen it."
4,"It's ""Wonderful"" and ""Popular,"" but missing is something...","If you are looking for a book with extras about ""Wicked: The Musical,"" then this is the book for you. The images that accompany the text are crisp and colorful and, for Joey Mac fans, there's even a Fiyero centerfold. Composition clippings, quotes, and even a how-to section on Elphie's dance are included, along with information from/about the various performers who portrayed each character. This volume really gives the reader a sense of the show from inception to production.That being said, the book has one shortcoming: no libretto (script). The main songs and moments are included; however, the full libretto does not appear in the book."
5,1 of a kind item for all Wicked fans!!,"This book is incredible!!!!! although it doesn't have the full liberattto, it is still amazing!!!the pictures have amazing resolution. i've always wanted to see wicked on broadway (i saw it in Los Angeles) and this book made me feel like i was there!! i also loved the account of each of the original broadway characters. it was wonderful to read about kristin chenoweth and idina menzel, whom are my favorite actresses!! thank you david cote and joan marcus for the wonderful pictures. i love this book!!!!"
5,The Grimmerie- The Wicked truth behind Wicked the musical,This book is as amazing as the musical-Large hardback book with an amazing cover and full length photos of the original cast and behind the scenes look of the stage and props-Although the WHOLE script is not included MOST of it is- including the lyrics to all the songs and the dialogs leading up to the song-If you haven't seen the musical- this book would walk you through the premise and give you a behind the scenes look at what to expect-If you have seen Wicked already- this is a must have to re-live that night over and over again- A GREAT book for collection and would make a great gift!Also- tip- it retails for $50 at the Gerswin Theater in NYC- much cheaper on Amazon-
3,Wind in the Willows,"The movie was good, but I was very disappointed in the case it came in. It was crushed and I cannot use the case. It had to have been that way when I purchased it because it was sent in a very secure box. I just wish the advertisement for the Wind in the Willows would have stated that its container was crushed. Had I known the case was crushed I would have bought somewhere else."
3,"Fine, but not one of her better works","I've read about a dozen of Georgette Heyer's novels. What I like about them is her outstanding characterization, witty dialogue, and period details. In addition, her books are ""clean"" with nothing more physical between her characters than a kiss, usually after they are engaged.I did not feel that this book was one of her better ones. The characterization was not up to her usual standards. I did not really feel like I knew the characters that well. I was never quite convinced about the hero falling in love with the heroine against his will. It also wasn't really believable that Arabella got away with her deception. The book was okay, but I don't plan to keep it.Other Georgette Heyer titles that I would recommend instead areThe Nonesuch,A Civil Contract,The Foundling,Cousin Kate,Frederica,The Unknown Ajax, andBlack Sheep."
3,Delightful,"I love Heyer's romances. I especially love her work going digital - and at such a low price, too.This story is fun and sweet. The humor is strong from the start and only grows more so as you become involved with the characters. And the characters are simply a pleasure to spend time with.The historical language can be a little heavy at times: there is even a hilarious scene where the heroine is having trouble trying to follow all the slang a character is using in trying to convey bad news to her. But you will never have any difficulties in following the gist of it.NOTE: If you are new to this author, you may dismiss certain aspects of the plot and characters standard for this genre. But Heyer INVENTED the Regency Romance in the 1920's and 30's; all the others you've read were derivative of HER works."
1,Can't get through it!,Wow- I really expected more of this book looking at the reviews. I read a lot & am a lover of words... but this is the most wordy & effusive writing style I have ever seen. The story might be good if I could get through a sentence without having to read it twice to get it's meaning. I don't have any interest in any of the characters and the verbiage (although i'm sure is contemporary for the book's setting) is tedious. I will keep plugging away but it is putting me to sleep most nights.
4,Delightful romance from the master,"I save 5 stars for the truly great Heyer novels, and this one is only darn good. Arabella Tallant, daughter of a clergyman who is well-endowed with virtue but not substance, travels to London for the season. On the road, she encounters the wealthy, cynical and oh-so bored Robert Beaumaris, who suspects her of conniving their meeting. In her indignation, Arabella pretends to be an heiress. Beaumaris isn't fooled, but it amuses him to encourage his rattle of a friend to repeat the story and launch Arabella into the stratosphere of society. But Arabella is no typical society miss, and Beaumaris finds himself reluctantly intrigued. Heyer's successors in the Regency field have turned much of this material into cliche, but her sharp eye for detail and keen ear for dialog make everything fresh. The introduction of a devoted mutt into Beaumaris' household is the source of the book's best moments."
4,Charming and Typical Georgette Heyer Fare,"I'll be honest: I have difficulty telling one Georgette Heyer apart from the other. In my mind, they all tend to tell the same story, but I think Heyer always does an excellent and charming job of recreating that story. Like numerous other Heyer regency romances, this is about a poor young woman who goes to London in search for a husband, and ends up nabbing the wealthiest and most eligible bachelor, largely by being a little naive, with a theatrical temper and compassion. Despite the fact that I KNOW I've read this story by Heyer before under numerous different titles, I found this book entertaining, the romance sweet, the whole trip was pleasurable and typically Heyer."
4,Another happy ending,"While not one of Heyer's best, Arabella is still a charming read, particularly after a slow start in the beginning (too much time invested on characters who never appear later). At first sight Mr. Beaumaris is so sardonic and condescending (he uses his considerable influence in society to ensure Arabella's success, all because it amuses him to see the upper class fussing over an heiress who is really a poor vicar's daughter), that it's hard to imagine him as our heroine's future husband, but each encounter makes him more romance-worthy. Mr. Beaumaris' nice-guy evolution along with Arabella's compounding troubles over her impulsive lie climaxes in a nice little ending that I read several times over to fully absorb the fun of it!"
1,Nothing but a collection of cheap shareware,"This disc sounded like it would be fantastic. Over 500 of the greatest computer games. When I got it however, I found that it's nothing more than a collection of cheap shareware with ads popping up and signs always trying to sell you something else. In addition, it says right on the package that it's consistent with Windows XP but it's not. After installing several of the games I tried to open them only to be faced with a popup that says: game not consistent with your operating system. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DISC. You can probably find all the shareware games yourself by doing a Google search. Popups, ads everywhere!!!"
1,TROJAN VIRUS on this CD,"Scanned the CD before loading and anti-virus found a level 1 Trojan in the program. Also, CD looks like a pirated. Dont buy this (or anything else from this vendor)."
3,Alternative viewpoint,"I have to agree with Mr. Levine, and less with some of the other reviewers. I think the saving grace of this recording is Skovhus. Rather than dominating the balance, he fits right in, as another instrument in an intricately layered piece. His tone is beautiful and consistent, he phrases the lines with subtlety and sensitivity, and his diction is good. Domingo, on the other hand, probably had a heavier hand when negotiating with the balance engineer, and he is put farther in front of the sound, and in my opinion too loud. On top of that, it sounds as if his understanding of the music--how it all hangs together--is superficial. His tone is nice and the musicality is intelligent, but perhaps he didn't spend as much time with it as he would have liked. As for LA and Salonen, it is everything one could ask for, a very interesting, refined, and nuanced reading."
4,A lot better than I expected,"Salonen made a terrific recording of the Mahler Third Sym. in spectacular 20-bit sound, soon following up with this recording of Das Lied. It's in the same vein of super-clear, detailed articulation rather than emotional overstatement, and it's very enjoyable, too. Domingo isn't just checking off his list of ""All the Music a Tenor Could Possibly Sing."" His singing here is gorgeously toned, and he is doing his best with the Germann. Skovhus has the bigger job, projecting a low male voice into the plush, plangent territory of a woman's part. But he does a good job, at least equal to his major rivals, Fischer-Dieksau and Hampson, sounding more lyrical than either. Ultimately, however, it's the gorgeous sound and Salonen's modern approach that draw me in. I have no desire to own a baritone Das Lied after this, yet am well satisfied to have such as good one."
1,vanishing breed,"This is certainly one of the lowest quality books in the genre. As a Trakehner breeder myself, I had hoped for something special. Very poorly put together, with characters so apallingly trite, flat and awful, this story is just a waste of time and energy. Ugh."
5,Very Good template,"I use this template for detailed portions of the landscape. It has numerous sizes for trees and shrubs, plus a variety of curves for all kinds of fun planning and drawing. I use the various square sizes for landscape stones and patterns. I allow my landscape students to use this template (no software). I really like the sidewalk corner which doubles as rounded steps. It has numerous uses for simply doodling. Excellent product and would recommend to others."
2,Too thin,This is absolutely too thin for most work with drawings. I would've opted for a thicker one had I known. At least a 1/16 thickness would've been better.
5,Wow!,"What a smooth sounding piece of work! I had never been a fan of his before, so I thought I would give this a try. I am glad I did and I will definitely be buying more of his work."
2,Not The Best Selection,The best and most beautiful song among this selection is Heaven Help Me by Deon Estus (w/George Michael) I thought the songs were hard to find tunes but they just weren't very good or somewhat popular songs. I was a little disappointed with this CD and only a few of the these songs brought back fond memories of my formative years in the '80s.
4,"The single version of ""Method Of Modern Love""","If you're looking for the single version of Hall & Oates ""Method Of Modern Love"", this is the only place you'll find it. Also, ""Sugar Free"" by Wa Wa Nee is another lost gem. Overall, it's a fun CD."
2,Good primer but not well written,"The first three chapters are pretty good discussion of the basics. But by the end the writing becomes rushed and incomplete, leaving me asking ""where's the rest of it?""Excluding the TOC, index and Appendix there's only 136 pages that cover a broad range of digital holography topics; barely touching the surface on many of them and leaving examples very incomplete.The writting is some times strained with poorly constructed sentenses and unexplained terms. It really could have used a round of editing by a good technical writer."
1,bad music,This is bad music no soul or anything. Clearly all musicians need a dose of real music like The Smiths or the Chameleons. Nuff said case closed say goodnight Cosmo.
1,Terrible...Just Terrible,"Perhaps I thought this book was going to be interesting because of the description on the back. How mistaken I was!!!!! Instead of getting into the story, the author wastes a lot of time getting lost in useless details. For example, every other page has run-ons about name brand items (I was wearing my $500 Chanel red shirt and my $1700 Chanel pants with the matching $400 Chanel sunglasses as I jumped into my silver Range Rover with the leather seats)-this is an example, not an excerpt. That is weak writing at its best!!! By Chapter 20...WE KNOW SHE DRIVES A SILVER RANGE ROVER WITH BLACK LEATHER SEATS. No need to keep drilling it into the ground. It's repetitive and takes too long for the drama and storyline to unfold. And I pray that the book I have is one in a million because there are ENDLESS typos and misspellings to the point that it becomes annoying and difficult to read. I am highly disappointed!!!"
2,The story is about......,"The title makes one want to read. However, the book talks about a lot of nothing. I would have rather seen more dialogue about the title and what the story was suppose to be about."
3,Not sure what the problem was,"I had high hopes for this one...but it didn't quite deliver. Plenty of PR was provided for the dining establishments in California though. A few of the places I will certainly visit if I'm ever in the area. Coupled with details about the latest fashions, the rap industry and the drug game---it was a lot to absorb. And DeMarco. Pages and pages of details about this man. Most of what was written didn't support the story. It was too long. I found myself skimming. Maybe I missed the good parts?"
4,Good with extra stuff,"The tool set is great, but has a lot of extra stuff which you will not need when you are riding on trail.."
5,Excelent,"Excelent and very complete tool for long ride, only have a problem the weight but is not a big deal"
5,Excellent for bicycle touring adventurers,"Tool is practical, a multi-function tool with spoke keys, chain breaker, saw, screwdriver, allen keys, tire lever, more functions. A really practical and solid built unit for bicycle touring and cyclists out on the wild roads/mountains. Recommended, A+"
5,Great tool,"Very satisfied of this tool, I have it with me every time I ride my bicycle, I can say I have all that I need to adjust/fix my bike with me"
3,something is wrong,"the tool does not lock. what i mean is that the system that keep the two parts of the tool is not working, my tool slides if I put a piece agains the other"
3,looks great but does not work that well,This product looks great but does not work well. It does not work well for a emergency so it is ok.
3,"Decent tool, but fragile","This has done everything as advertised quite well. I have not used all of the functions, but I am happy with it in that regard. I dropped it on the concrete however, and now the two pieces don't stay together because the interior clasp-spring broke. Yeah, I broke it, but it seems that a tool such as this should be a bit more robust."
3,"Clever tool, broken latch","Good: This is a well thought out tool. It has everything I need except for a T10 for my Elixir's bleed screw. Overall, it feels sturdy. I like the case. Should help prevent it from wearing holes in my CamelBak.Bad: The latch that holds the two halves together broke after only a few rides, so it doesn't stay clipped together. It stays in its case in my CamelBak and I think just bouncing around broke the latch. Not that big of a deal for me to go through the hassle of returning it, but it deserves to be noted that the latch is a tiny piece of rubbish.You might consider one of the Crank Brothers tools."
4,"Handy tool, minor defects","The metal portions are well made and have worked well for any repairs that I have made. After carrying it around in one of the bags on my bike (inside of its protective case) for a couple months the locking tab that holds the two halves together snapped. A bit irritating, but it doesn't effect the performance. The chain tool isn't as finely machined as would be nice (a bit of wobbling makes it necessary to really watch the pin making sure it doesn't bend when installing a chain, as the pin in the tool slips off center)."
2,Really great product but...,This item shipped super fast but as I opened the box I heard a rattle. As I took the item out of the packaging I found the button that separates the two halves to be broke. Being that I was heading out riding the next few days I didnt want to send it back and its a good thing I didnt because I ended up needing it a few times. Other than the button this is great I have used every tool on it.
5,Used it to assemble entire bike,I used this to assemble an entire GMC Denali road bike. It is a solid tool that I expect to use in perpetuity.
4,Nice Buy,"This is a must have if you ride a lot. This is a quality tool set at a reasonable price. REI has it listed for $40. Get it, you will not be sorry. It has every tool you will need to make any repair or adjustment to your bike."
3,Too Big and Too Bulky to keep in a Pack,"I think this tool is a little overkill. It is impossible to fit this into a small pack with a MTB tube and CO2 inflators. I would recommend the Crank Brothers 17 tool over this, because its a slim, and strong design without any plastic parts."
4,"Good Set, Flimsy Body","Has everything one would normally need, but the body seems a little flimsy. Turning a tough bolt causes a serious twisting in the frame, which worries me. I'd rather have a little more weight and a reliable frame."
3,Reasonable multi-function tool,"I bought this for the chain tool, which is all I've used so far. The chain tool works but seems a little flimsy since the screw/pin appears to be made of plastic. As such it may be easy to strip and I've found it's slightly difficult to keep threaded straight. The rest of the product seems solid."
5,Awesome Toolset,"It's a great tool set, compact, versatile, easy to use, and built with high quality. The a mini pedal wrench turned out to be quite powerful when it's attached to the handle. I was able to unscrew two old mountain bike pedals quite easily. The carrying case makes it even look smaller and fit in the seat bag nicely. It does save me room since I don't need any other tools."
5,Pretty good deal,"This tool is really handy, because of its small size and good material. I would recommend this to anybody who is a regular cyclist or a novice like me."
4,"Not so great as a bike tool, but maybe useful for other things.","I bought this guy specifically for the chain tool and the allen wrenches. As a ""bike emergency repair tool"" it doesn't really get the job done. It doesn't even have the right wrench to remove a wheel from the frame. If you want a bicycle multi-tool for roadside repair, look over your bicycle and determine which tools you will really need for your roadside emergencies. Unless EVERYTHING on your bike is connected via allen bolts, this thing isn't very useful. Like I said, it does have the chain tool and spoke wrenches that work pretty well, but the rest of the things on here are just ""eye-candy.""However, if you have a use in mind other than bicycle repair, maybe you're like me and you really need the allen wrenches anyway."
4,Review dependent on use...,"These tools are very compact what has obvious benefits if you want to carry them with you at all times. On the whole, these seem solid and most likely include all tools one might need in event of road emergency. On the other hand, such miniaturization impacts the comfort with which these can be used, and if you plan to use them for everything (including more complicated repair), you may want to choose something ""more full size"".My use is what I described in the first part of the review, therefore I would recommend them to others mainly because of the ratio ""many tools in small package"""
2,too bulky,I don't carry this with me....lots of stuff but too heavy so it stays in my garage and is not used much. Thank you.
5,Essential Tool Kit,"This product is awesome! It replaces most of the tools you'd have to carry, for only 3/4 the weight! Could have also come with a set of pliers but no big deal."
5,like they read my mind,This well made compact multi-tool is exactly what it claims to be. I have been looking for one tool to handle every job my bike might need and it seems like someone read my mind and made it! And this is it.
5,Great tools,This set has everything you need to get you out of a jam and some. It is small enough to fit in my small pouch with the spare tube. The kit is strong enough but light enough to take in long trips.
2,Far too expensive,"This tool is far too expensive for what you can do with it.We put my son's bike together with this tool, but we had to supplement it with other tools."
2,Toooo smalll,"As i got the tool, i was surprised... its too small and i got really hard time to fix my bike."
5,excellent tool,"compact versatile, very happy with it, has bailed me out many times. excellent for a tool to carry on your ride!"
5,Great tool for the road...,"I'm usually a bit skeptical about the 'all in one' solutions, but Topeak really nailed it with this one. I have already used this tool extensively for everything from tightening a few screws to truing a wheel in a pinch. For the commuting rider I can't think of a more effective tool."
4,Kitchen Sink,"When I first opened the box I was struck at how heavy this tool is. Yes, it does everything! Bring it on a family ride with everything from road bikes to cruisers to klunkers.... there is a tool here to fix almost anything! But, that comes at a cost... weight. What I learned from this is to rethink what tools my bike needs (allens, vs. sockets etc...) and what i'm likely to fix on the trail/road vs. calling the sag-wagon... then get the tool that will meet those needs. This is for the inner boy-scout :-)"
4,"Great tool, minor complaint","Excellent multitool for the road bag and general maintenance. The large hex keys alone justifies the buy, with tire levers and screwdrivers included in the same package. It only loses a star for durability, as two teeth on the chain breaker tool bent and sheared off during a chain removal. The chain tool still works, but is not a substitute for a separate chain breaker. That being said, the multitool is still a great addition to your road bag."
5,Amazing Gadget,Good handy set of bicycle pocket tools. Ingenious design. Press a release button on the side and it slides out into 2 parts. Voila! Now all tools are accessible. One set of tools has a locking mechanism so after use press the metal release button to reset. Ive used a few of tools to adjust my brakes and tighten some screws. Works like a charm.
4,the macgyver tool for MTB,This tool has everything i could think of for a mtb. just watch out for the knife its real sharp. i found out the hard way.I had to do a exchange for this multitool because the chain breaker pin bent. I hope i got the only bad egg.
5,Amazing tool,"Amazing tool, it has everything I need to maintain my mountain bike except a wrench large enough to tighten the kickstand (but that is understandable). The pouch it comes with I was able to clip onto my saddle bag easily enough. I haven't tried to use them as tire levers, as I carry a full set of tire levers in my saddle bag. Very pleased with this purchase."
5,Everything but the kitchen sink,"You can't go wrong with this tool, it has everything you'd ever need on the road.I really like design of a 2-part chain break tool, I haven't had to use it yet but after using others the extra leverage will definitely help if I ever do need it.My only issue with it is the weight but until I loose about 10-lbs myself I can't really count grams..."
5,super bike tool,"excellent tool that all bikers should have. compact size,good construction. a little heavy,but that tells me it is high quality metal. last bike tool i will ever need! great buy on amazon"
3,nice to have,"i purchased this set to have when i go bike riding as i do a lot of mountain biking, and sometimes things come lose and this is a and tool set to have, i would have only like if it had an adjustable wrench attachment as well then that would be great.."
3,"Great tools, very heavy though",I had been looking for a multi tool for some time now that had a pedal wrench and this one fit the bill. Tools work very well overall but the kit is very heavy. I was a bit shocked but I still use it on a weekly basis for my road and mountain bike. I'm not a racer and not overly concerned by weights but I was just shocked at how heavy this is.
4,"Nice Tool, Packed with Features","This is a nice tool, packed with features. I was impressed withe the overall quality and fit and finish. The engineering is unique and they shove a lot of tools into a small form factor.I have one main complaint - they include a nice carrying case with a clever attachment on the back - but they don't include a bracket for it. The bracket would allow you to attach it to the frame and/or seatpost. While that may not be for everyone, it seemed like a small corner to cut which was annoying to me at least. If they had included a bracket I would give it 5 stars."
3,"Okay, but has its flaws","Unfortunately had to send the first one back to Amazon - excellent return service by the way. The tool is held together using a small catch which was defective. For the price I expected it to work. The replacement tool also has a defective catch, so I am guessing its a bad run on their production line. The catch is slightly better on this one, i.e. the tool holds together most of the time.One comment on the Allen keys (wrenches?). They are all metric and will not fit the bolt on the iBert Safe-t-seat. You will still need to carry around the Allen key that iBert send to you. I really wish the US was metric.Happy Cycling to you all."
5,Has it all,"This little tool has everything you might need, my husband I have a tandem with tripple clamp forks so we need alen to take the front tire off, this goes nicely on a small pack so it's always handy"
3,overkill,It's a good tool set but too complicated for me and a little too bulky. I would go with a $10 9pc park tool if I would buy a tool set again to put in my saddle bag. There are many parts that I either don't use or don't remember how to use. The 5mm hex wrench is most used. I used it to adjust my brakes and derailleurs but it's too cumbersome after a while. I would buy a separate 5mm handled hex wrench for any extended work. I used the pedal wrench to swap pedals but it was too small to have any power. I ended up buying a pedal wrench from LBS. I think it's a overkill for a portable tool set and lacking for some real repair work.
5,The Quintessential Book for my Grandchildren,"I loved the book, it was bright, fun and had a refreshing creativity and charm that I have not experienced in a long time. I am ordering hard copies for my four Grandchildren, and I recommend it to everyone for a delightful and entertaining read!! The Author is wonderful and possesses a keen imagination and a delightful sense of humor. I will be searching my Kindle for more John Feltman books!!! BUY IT!!"
4,story for all ages,This was an imaginative tale that should please both children and their parents who may read it to them. Unfortunately the kindle format does not do justice to the beautiful illustrations but that should not hamper your enjoyment.
3,Strange Brew Not Quite My Cup Of Tea,Although I enjoyed this sixth additon to the Callihan Garrity series I really missed the House Mouse characters. One of the reasons I read this series is to learn of the further adventures of Baby & Sister and the rest of the gang. Although they do help out towards the end of the book to discover the muderer this story focused on the gentrification of established neighborhoods and less on the Mouse cleaning group which has provided me with many laughs in the past. I found that I really didn't care who killed Wuvvy (someone who hates grown-ups having baby names?) and felt that Trocheck was trying to be more like Sue Grafton than herself. Here's hoping she'll go back to her humerous roots that keep us coming back for more laughs.
2,I am rather dissapointed in this Kathy Hogan Trocheck book.,"I love the character of Callahan Garrity and have found myself eagerly looking forward to each of Kathy Hogan Trocheck's books. As a former resident of Atlanta, I have appreciated the accuracy of her work in capturing the true flavor of the city especially the Little Five Points area and its residents. I reluctantly say that this book was not nearly the quality of material I have come to expect from this author. The story line seemed rather implausible and the character development was nil. I would reccomend this book to die hard Callahan fans but would caution them not to expect too much."
2,"Beginners Software CM book, short on content","As a developer who has had some configuration management experience I was very disappointed in this book. The basics of CM are covered tutorial style, using RCS as the example tool.The book repeats much information by breaking it up into individual and team sections. It seems the authors were determined to meet a predetermined number of pages, one appendix is simply a printing of the RCS man pages, which were also included on the CDrom. The reviews of tools are in a nice format but are certainly not thorough enough to really help someone looking for information. The authors would have served thier readership better by covering the material once and then filling pages by adding depth. The authors background should have provided enough experience to produce a better book. ""Applying Rcs and Sccs : From Source Control to Project Control"" by Don Bolinger, Tan Bronson, Mike Loukides (Editor) is a far better value."
1,Fly by the seat of your pants SCM!,"As a person who has over 15 years of experience in SCM and teaches the discipline professionally I found this text completely unacceptable. It doesn't address any of the fundamentals of SCM (i.e., configuration identification, change control, etc.) or and of the primary problems associated with software develpment such as shared data, simultaneous update, etc. Finally, it doesn't address process management, impact analysis, facilitating good communications, running a CCB, and more. About the only thing I found the book is good for is learning about the tool shipped with the book."
3,Bought as a gift,The friend I bought this for is a VW bus freak and loved this addition to his memorabilia from this period.
5,The best!,Great facts about hippies presented in an intelligent manner. I enjoyed the book a lot and recommended it to my friends who were looking for some cool reading!
4,"RIGHT ON, MAN!","This is a great book for anybody interested in the bygone hippie days of the 1960's and 1970's. But it's not just about hippies. It includes a host of useful information that you can use in research, writing, browsing or any other endeavor that involves those years. Well-organized listings stretch from Amphetamines to Zulu warriors to all the US presidents of the hippie Era. I'm not saying everything is listed, but it contains a bunch of stuff, that's for sure. For instance, want to know the Comix and underground Cartoon Strips of the Era? Look on page 681. Want to know who Ella Baker was? Look on page 594. Remember MAD magazine? What me worry? Look on page 318. In my opinion, this short dictionary is well worth its meager price tag, and I consider it a valuable addition to my growing reference library."
5,Excellent book,I very much enjoyed this book which covers the 60s and the entire Hippie movement in this country. It is a book you can often refer for clarification and explanation of terms...I would recommend it for anyone who lived through this era.
4,Seems to help,"I have had chronically irritated vocal chords for a couple of years now. The doctors just kept shuffling me off to other departments because it wasn't life threatening and they couldn't figure it out. So I couldn't do public performances, sing at church, record new material, etc. in all that time because it hurt for a long time after even only one song. Finally I got desperate and orderd this stuff. Have to say, I'm impressed. It may taste gross but this stuff soothed my irritated vocal chords and allowed me to get through a whole week of practice and one full set leading worship at church. I had to reapply about every 45 minutes to keep the throat moist but it did actually help. I went through it pretty quick so I'll be ordering more soon."
3,eh,I was skeptical about using this so i really cant comment on how this spray works. the price was good and shipping was GREAT
1,Makes me PUKE,"I gotta tell ya, I bought this because of the good reviews because I wanted to try something different and the first time I sprayed this in my throat I about puked. Yeah, it's that bad. It has a horrible taste and even a burning sensation. Makes me gag so much I can't even use it. I thought I'd get used to it, so every now and then I give it a spray or two, but I just can't do it. Terrible. What's worse, is the foul aftertaste you get in your mouth and when you're talking to someone, cover your mouth with your hand. I'm talking major bad breath. I'm sticking with my Vocal Eze. It has a soothing soft, kinda marshmallowy taste and seems to do it's job satisfactory. I'm ordering another VocalEze today and tossing this stuff here in the trash."
3,Tough laryngitis,"I have received brief help from the spray , but O really need to get rid of laryngitis before I can truly tell its value."
2,Not the original formula,It's taste worst and doesn't work as well. I wouldn't recommend it. I had to break down and go buy the original at Whole Foods after a few days
3,"Tastes awful, but..",I have used this before a performance and I have noticed a difference in how lubricated my throat feels. It tastes really bad and it only lasts a little while.
1,booooring,"I got almost 130 pages into this before I sat back and wondered why I was reading something so boring! Other than being attacked by supernatural wolves one time and having ""scary"" dreams the main character is just trying to solve a mystery that the reader already knows the answer to. I myself don't really care for that. Oh yeah and the vampires....yeah I never got to that part. 130 pages in and there is one in his dream. Thats about it. I was almost halfway through this book and the vamps still hadn't show up. I was bored to tears and had I had anything else to do I wouldn't have gotten as far as I did in this book. I picked it up because of the awesome cover art, but cover art doesn't save a bad book."
5,"Fast paced excitement. Geographically accurate, loved it!",What a thrill to read a great work of fiction based in the Tri-Cities area! I couldn't put it down.
1,What a waste of time,"I will never get the time I spent reading this book back. It is GONE GONE GONE. Mind you, cheesy writing with one dimensional characters is not a crime, but this book could set a precedent.Creating a gang of friends just so that you can kill, maime, and injure them in various ways is a cheap way to gain emotional response from the readers. Of course, we the readers could care less since the characters were never really developed properly.Dawn of the Vampire is bad on so many levels, it seems unfair to actually get too detailed in reviewing it. I can only give a warning and wonder if all those glowing rave reviews are only a trick to sucker others the way I have been suckered. If only there were negative stars."
1,Awful!,I had to stop reading after the 1st quarter of the book. Went to the finish to see that it ended as poorly as it began. What the publishers were thinking about when they put this out confounds me. It reads like a (not very good) first draft that was never passed by an editor.
3,"The idea of a day walking vampire is the ""bomb.""",Wreythville a cemetery buried under water is disturbed by a couple diving for riches. Terry and Traylor discovers and opens a box that contains a medallion. Terry puts it on and she unleashes the curse of the vampires. Vampires that walk the day and feed of human beings. The only weakness the vampires have is that they can't get in contact with water.
5,A personal recollection,I went to school with Marty Atwood and met his sister Mimi. I remember the Life photographer coming to school to take a picture of Marty for the magazine in 1971. Where are you now Marty? Richard Ennis
5,Amazing True Story,"This is a true story of a family with 19 mostly adopted children. Most of them are handicapped! If you think it's tough raising your kids, you need to see this. You don't know how easy you have it! :-)"
4,Ganty,"I have recently read the novel strange objects and was impressed by its very interesting and twisted storyline. The style that the book is written in is very effective in keeping the reader on edge and always thinking about the book and what may happen next.The story is based around a boy named Steven Messenger who, while on a school biology camp, comes across a 'canibal' pot wich contained a mummified hand with a golden ring on its finger. Problems arise for Steven when the ring of the finger gets caught in his sleeping bag and is bought home with him.After this we get taken on a journey into the very strange life of Steven Messenger through his personal diary entries and other collections of data concerning the recents events in his life.It is definately a book that deserves your attention."
2,It is good but not great,After reading Strange objects I was bitterly disappointed with the story line. It was dull with only afew thrill although we were left in suspense with a rather inriguing story path the reader was left annoyed with a finish which didnt even give a piece of information about why he went missing or whatever this book must not be bought by any persoon or even touched cause it is no good so do your self a favour and dont read this book u fools...
2,Strange Objects,"I read this book and i thought it was fantastic, i love Gary Crew he is the best writer. This is one of his best books ever. A great read."
3,It's ok,"Good at times, bad at others, about the only thing remarkable on this record is the sound - I have never heard synthesizers and guitars blended this way before. It depends on the listener whether that is a good or bad thing. Personally, it just isn't my bag. Sure, I like well produced and synthesized music like Nine Inch Nails, but this just doesn't cut it for me. The singles are ok, but much of the rest is filler. And it's amazing how fast the singer's voice gets on your nerves..."
4,"Great, but where is the meaning?","PM5K's latest, ""Tonight The Stars Revolt"" was overall a pretty good CD. It was upbeat, the lyrics were friendly, and most of the songs were pretty good. My favorite songs on it are ""The Son of X-51"" and ""Supernova Goes Pop."" Okay, if you want to know my real problem with Powerman5000, it is the fact that their lyrics don't really have any significant meaning to me. They don't relate to my life at all, since most of the songs have a ""space"" type of feel to them. I would actually give them a 3, but I am in a good mood, so they get a 4."
4,A Very Good and Powerful Piece of plastic,"I got this album because I heard When worlds collide, and nobdy's real. When I listened to it, it had lots of great songs with real hard metal and grunge attitude. There were some extremly cool songs like Tonight the stars revolt, automatic, and Supernova goes pop. It has great Lyrics with explosive sound. If you like real hard rock, get this album. It is better than rob Zombie(Although I just found out thaat the lead singer, Spider, Is rob Zombie's brother)"
4,not bad,"this is a pretty wicked album. The vocals are heavy and dark, and the music is heavy in a sci-fi kind of way with many interesting samples. The sound is very reminiscent of rob zombie (which is no surprise since spider is rob's brother) and there's a cameo by zombie himself on ""blast off to nowhere"" which is one of the heaviest songs on the cd. Other tracks that make the cd worth it are ""when worlds collide"", ""operate annihilate"", ""nobody's real"", and ""good times roll"". this is the best pm5k release. very impressive."
5,Solid album,"Great artist and an interesting unique sound, which is quite cool when your Rob zombie's brother."
3,the songs all sound the same!!!,"The first few weeks of owning this cd, which i got this summer, i loved it. But after listening through it a dozen or more times in a couple weeks the songs got repetitive and boring. It's still a great album, but not something i would listen to very often."
3,"worlds collide is great but the rest of the album, feh","I think it may be best put this way, if you've heard ""When worlds collide"" on the radio then you have no real reason to buy the CD. I guess it might worth buying it just for worlds collide.....but the rest of the album is a certifiable mouse potato"
3,"It's ok, but......","""Tonight the Stars Revolt"" is pretty good, but gets old fairly quickly. The songs are ok, but there's nothing here thats very memorable. ""Good Times Roll"" is the standout track on the album, and it is a good blast of fun, but only in small doses."
1,BOOOOOF!!!,"Do not compare this record with the Rob Zombie's one, please. Compare it with White Zombie records, especially the last two ones ('La Sexorcisto' and 'Astro Creep'), and then you will understand why this is really not a good one at all."
2,This is a pretty good cd...,If you like your metal/rock a little lighter then Disturbed and a little heavier then Creed...
2,"2 words, It Sucks","Mega!! Kung Fu Radio was one of the greatest cd's i have listen too from powerman, but then, they changed there look, they are all in space and everything sounds like it is from space... It sounds stupid. I would prefer Mega!! Kung Fu Radio because that will just blow you away. You got Rap, alternative, rock, and funk altogther... Really a great CD, but this one is really bad..."
3,"iz ok, but not that to great","iz an ok recording by PM5K, tho i prefer their earlier stuff.... spider has good melody... the recording sounds almost to much like rob/white zombie to me.... if you don't hav PK5K's first albumz, get them, then consider this..."
4,This is very good,"Powerman 5000 go off. This is up there with Limp Bizkit's newest CD significant other. It has got some killer tracks in ""supernova goes pop"", ""nobodys real"", ""tonight the stars revolt"", ""son of x51"" and of course ""when world collide"". You won't tire of this CD quickly, they will go off at family values"
4,When Worlds Collide,"This Cd is so awesome! Spider the lead singr is brothers w/ Rob Zombie! The best song is When Worlds Collide. Ginger Fish from the Gothic Manson is on it, DJ Lethal is on it, Rob Zombie's on it. PM5K sounds like Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson."
5,Totally different in a wonderful way.,"I commend Spider and the band for being so unique and keeping with a wonderful theme throughout the cd. They've changed alot compared to the old ""Mega!! Kung Fu Radio"" and the change is a great one. But don't get me wrong, the old ones were amazing too, but they've changed alot from their punkish ways to a true heavy metal. I also love the difference in Spider's voice compared to the ""clean-cut"" voices of the people in heavy metal and alternative today.If you like Rob Zombie and buy this CD just because Spider and Rob Zombie are siblings, you're going to disappointed in that sense, because they are definatly unalike. But if you're going to buy this CD and listen to it with an open mind, you're going to really enjoy it.In general, PM5K is a favorite band of mine and it's only for the adventureous."
4,Powerman 5000 - Best Work,"Powerman 5000's best work. But I warm you, do not take this music seriously, it's there to be listened for fun. Spider One's voiceis awesome and he has got a great skill of changing his voice through the songs.If you give it a little time you'll soon find it pretty entertaining. Tracks like ""When Worlds Collide"" and ""Nobody's Real"" are the biggest ""hits"" from this album. But also the rest of the tracks have very good feel to them. Son of X51 is a very heavy song, like Automatic also; and They Know Who You are. (allthou repetitive). The title track Tonight the Stars revolt is also pretty cool.All the songs have a good feel to them...it just is no real metal. It is entertainment music for the younger folks."
4,Very good CD,"This CD is very good...I gave it 4 stars only because it's short, around 39 minutes. The songs have catchy tunes, and if you like metal, this may or may not be for you...some people don't consider PM5K metal. All in all, a great purchase, with all the lyrics printed in the booklet. Go out and buy it!"
2,Angry Young Boys Will Love It!,"Powerman's `I'm so evil' posturing is so cute it's almost cloying. They try so hard to be scary you feel like writing them a letter saying they should be banned just so they'll feel better about themselves. Teeny boppers looking for inoffensive by the numbers rebellion will doubtless be fooled, but everyone else will find the band a lark."
2,Not worth it,"These guys are just another rock band that is here only to open for good bands at there concerts. The only decent track on this CD is When Worlds Collide, and maybe a few others. Not a good CD, don't waste your money, just download or tape When Worlds Collide."
1,Ooch,"I did not like this cd because it made my Genital Warts react..I know what your thinking..In your mind your saying, ""Scotty, how in the heck could a cd make your Genital Warts react?"" Well buddy boy, when I listen to this cd the spacey peice or shoop worthless music with annoying hooks gives me the goosebumps. Whenever I get the goosebumps it make my redness break out which causes my genital warts to kick in.I remember one time I was at target in the music section shopping and they were playing one of their songs and I started itching my crotch and everyone laughed.-Scotty VanPeepin"
3,"the single ""when worlds collide"" is great... the rest isn't","the single was really good, so i guess i expected more out of the rest of the album... but most of it is really bland. still worth buying tho... for the two or three songs that are good"
4,Good music,This is a very good cd. it is a bit off from my favorites like offspring and pennywise but it caught my ear and now I love it. A very good investment.
5,Spider is takin the course of his bro,"On MTV when i saw the ""When worlds collide"" video i thought gee that looks stupid, but once i listened more into i was enjoyin every bit of it when i recently got this cd i listened to each track each 1 is great it has a spooky fellin that makes wonder whats comin next I rate ""TONIGHT THE STARS REVOLT""Instrumental-5 of 5 Lyrics-5 of 5 and Production- 5 of 5 When u first listen I suggest no.'s 2,3,4,6,8,and 10 to really bang u in there becuz they're the best 1's"
2,A carbon copy!,The title of my review basically sums up what i view Powerman 5000 to be.Nothing here is new and authentic.Nothing is fresh and invigorating.Sure i do dig bands that sound similar to many other bands(so sue me).Yet Powerman 5000 have taken the sound of Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie and emulated them.It's not only the copying of sounds which causes me to dislike this release it lacks emotion and sounds dry and contrived.Many bands can pull off emulating another bands sound and still sound fresh and happening but unfortunately folks Powerman 5000 fall flat!!
5,One of the best CDs I ever heard!,"This CD is one of the best CDs I've ever listened to! When I first got this CD, I didn't know just how great it could be! They produce a sound that differs immensely from other bands. Very futuristic, the songs just make you wanna jump up and down! I found the whole ""design"" of the CD to very unique, as well.....You can find that out for yourself by purchasing the CD. ;)""Your future has arrived. Are you ready to go?"""
5,One of the best albums ever!,Every song on this CD rocks. I have listened to it over and over and I love it.
4,makes me want to break something,"I thought Powerman 5000 was pretty lame when I first knew of them, but Worlds Collide grew on me enough so that I gave the album a listen. I was blown away by how good this is. I know nothing of their previous albums, but this one definitely brings a ruckus. The first three songs especially kick... Forget comparisons to Rob Zombie, they sound a lot more like Marilyn Manson, circa Antichrist Superstar. A very rocking CD. So if you think they are a bit on the weird side, do yourself a favor and don't write them off but give this album a try. Rock."
4,A real energetic metal album!,"This CD rocks! In 'TONIGHT THE STARS REVOLT!' Powerman 5000 brings on real hard metal guitars and scary furious screams. If your into techno/industrial type of metal with jammin' guiatrs and space/future type lyrics, you will love this CD!"
5,"I have only one word to say, WOW!!!!","When I first heard When Worlds Collide on the radio a couple of months ago I thought it sounded really strange. The more I heard it, however, the better it got. Finally, I went and bought the CD and it's the best decision I have ever made. I expected it to be good, but not this good. Every normal song on the CD is better than just about every other band's best songs. Please don't listen to all the negative reviews this CD has gotten in the past few days. It seems that most of them liked Powerman's old stuff better than the new stuff. They went from a Limp Biskit clone to one of the best metal bands I have ever heard. I almost feel sorry for big brother Rob. He's one of the best artists out there and he's still far behind in second place in his own family for best music. If you really like hard-core music that is meant to be played as loud as your ear drums can handle, get this CD RIGHT NOW!!!!"
3,Not that great,"I only liked ""When World's Collide"", the rest is too much of a childish nature. If you're expecting songs that sound like ""When World's Collide"", you're in for a disapointment."
2,More Wanted,"This disc leaves an empty feeling that a key element of a rock cd needs, Change. This cd features songs that are very similiar and share that loud electronic beat. the only different song is their biggest hit 'when worlds collide'. If you are realy into Zombie get it otherwise its not a smart buy."
3,"""Mediocre Rock Alubum of the Year""","""Tonight the Stars Revolt"" is one of those albums where you hear the hit single and think the whole CD is going to be like the single and you end up dissapointed. The most entertaining songs would be, ""When World's Collide, Nobody's Real and Good Times Roll."" Otherwise, all of the songs are in a dreary, low-key format and don't represent the theme of the album very well."
2,Conveys wrong attitudes...,"Rosa Jiminez, a new arrival to SVH wants to feel a part of the 'crowd' and in doing so, attempts to disguise her Mexican origin by renaming herself as Rose Jameson. In doing so, she is accepted into the 'usual' SV crowd but, is witness to certain prejudiced comments from the group concerning Mexicans. The final straw comes when Rosa holds a party for her friends and all seems well until snobby and pretentious Lila Fowler walks in on Rosa talking to her grandmother in Spanish. Quickly muttering an excuse, Rosa tells Lila that she was talking to the cleaner and Lila makes a snobby and prejudiced comment (when doesn't she)? Will Rosa be able to face up to and be proud of her past? Or will she become a victim of prejudice?"
1,a waste of time,With this book you get what you pay for. I found the content to be simple. The volume appear to be impressive. This was until I found that the work only contained four or five lines per page. I would not recommend this book.
4,Resonant,"I bought this CD for the first track. I love the feel, his voice, the melody, everything about it really. It's the only song I've heard of it's kind. It reminds me a lot of call to prayer and the resonance of that voice. The other tracks are great for Yoga or Thai Massage."
5,MY FAVORITE CD FOR YOGA!!!,"I have to say this is hands down my favorite cd to practice yoga to. The beginning sets me in the zone, the middle tracks all continue my focus as well as adding in beats which help me strive deeper in my practice. And the ending is too beautiful for words. This cd takes me on a journey and if it is the kind of music you like it will surely do the same for you. I recommend this to everyone I know!!!"
3,a little out there,"i was looking for something melow and calming to do yoga with, but this was a bit too strange sounding, with chanting and unusual sounds. at times too soft, almost in-audible and at times too powerful. i get the impression it is more authentic to the sanscrit roots of yoga, but not the type of music i've ever heard in a mainstream yoga class."
2,bland,I found this to be rather bland and repetative. It is difficult to find good Yoga music because everyone's tastes are so different. I prefer drums and traditional instruments. This one is a bit new agey for me.
2,Not that great!,I own several Pilates DVDs but this is the first time that I bought one by Hilary Burnett. I am not crazy about this one. I don't see why she is in such a hurry to move from one thing to another. It is annoying. I have done advanced pilates for a while and it is not necessary to rush it along to get a good workout.
4,Quick Advanced Workout,"I enjoy this quick 20 minute intense (for pilates) workout. It really is not for someone who isn't completely familiar with the exercises or positions though. The moves are quick and are not explained, so you need to know what each one is.I find it effective and enjoy doing this in the morning to wake up and get my blood flowing."
1,"Horrible, Not Challenging","With an ""advanced"" title, I thought this would be difficult. Instead, I did not even feel like I worked out. The tape is very rushed and only does 1 or 2 reps before quickly moving on. If you are looking for a challenging pilates tape, I would not recommend this one. Instead, check out the Stott Pilates tape."
5,Awesome Science,We used this book as a second grade science selection in our Charlotte Masonish secular homeschool. We all enjoyed the narrative approach to the important topics covered. I highly recommend it.
5,Old Fashioned manners are never out of style,"I have owned a copy of ""Amy"" since my late teens (I'm 66 now). I bought copies for my granddaudhters and ... my sister. Each understood that I was handing them a book of information and solutions, not a critique of their present manners. You can always ease off on formality, but it's hard to amp it up if you don't know the rules. This is the ultimate in guidelines."
2,Amy Vanderbelts Complete Book of Etiquette,I was disappointed to find out how long ago this book was written. It is very outdated. It is not an easy read. If you like nostalgia then this is your book. If you want to know what the etiquette is for emailing invitations this is not that book. It was published around 1950. It was not what I thought is was going to be.
4,French Tweak,"It was there all along. Echoes of Lou reed and the Velvet Underground, Bob Dylan's defiance,and Serge Gainsbourg's 60's kitsch. You had to listen carefully under the electronic beat layersof ""Prelude to a grand Love Story""(Kid Loco's first album) to capture the mad blunted prodigy'sinfluences. ""Kill your Darlings"" offers no apologies for being a rock album, and mocks aworldwide consensus that the French can't(rock). Kid Loco's ""pastiche"" humor saves ""Darling""from being self-indulgent and cliché, and never takes itself too seriously. But his genius lies in a grand fakery of sampling and knob tweaking, which with the enlisted help of singers Tim Keegan (Departure Lounge) and Louise Quinn, creates the perfect illusion of a great band lost in time."
4,Don't you know I'm Loco...,"Well, Kid Loco is finally back. His new album is an interesting adventure through humor and love. There are songs that are for past fans of his music, and many new and inventive ideas. It is not an album for everybody, however, but that is why I did not give it five stars. That is the ONLY reason.The Kids' production quality is even better than with ""Grand Love Story."" There is also much more vocal help with this album, and that is where the humor and the love come in.One warning, there are a couple of songs that are not everyday listeners. They are good songs, funny songs, but once you heard them a few times you might skip to the next. Listen to the samples and have a good time getting LOCO.-B-"
4,kid loco keeps it fresh,Being a fan of Kid Loco I wouldnt say that this a bad album or that this is not his stlye. I think Kid has come with something fresh and new alot of people can get with the velet undergorung with that dark edge. Its the kind of cd I can put on with friends sit back and drink Martinies and reflect on life!
1,Not at all the kid loco we know....,"If you bought this album in a blind way (as I did) thinking that ""hey'! it's kid loco and I liked 99% of what he's done so far...so how can I go wrong?"" well you're in for a big disapointment as I am.Very un-inspiring and un-inspired to my taste.....I'll try to get rid of it somehow."
1,HATE DRESSED UP AS SCIENCE,"From the back of the book:""...perhaps the proverbial 'straw' that broke the camel of Islam's back.""and""...designed to overcome Muslim allegiance to their prophet.""and""...the answer to the serious threat of Islam.""and""...tool to counter the Islamic belief system.""Do these rave reviews sound like those for a book with it's basis in science?This book has one purpose: to attack the religious beliefs of a fifth of the earth's population.The theme of this rant is equivalent to a water geologist analizing the heavy metal content of Christ's home town in order to prove Christ was delusional because of lead in his blood. It's absurd.It's yet another attempt to justify our contempt for and slaughter of Moslems. For those needing to denigrate another's beliefs in order to justify their own, this book will fill their needs.If you suspect holy wars should best be left in the past, this book is best avoided."
4,good value cot,"The previous reviews sum it up, a good value, with assembly easy enough until the last crossbar. Have not used yet but it appears stable enough and comfortable after a few minutes. Will have to try a full nights sleep on it. Anywaythis is for the infrequent overnite guest only since we do not go camping. A good back-up plan."
4,Strong cots,"I am @225lbs. This cot held me and my gear no problem. Tough to set up, but if you want a firm cot, that's expected."
3,Falcon's Stableboys,"Okay, I could add verbatim what my predecessor reviwers stated... too small, not enough true legends... more pictures of some...too many of others... but when it really comes down to it what did you expect when you ordered it... naked men in revealing poses for your viewing pleasure.... that's what you'll get! As for legends, I'm not exactly sure the state of the adult industry today is allowing for many legends to be born... pretty beefcake flash in the pans... frankly I'll take Mike Branson as a legend or just his beautific gigantic self.... enjoy the book.... there's no denying that it will give you pleasure in one way or another"
5,A fascinating survey of the pioneers of honky-tonk,"Southwest Shuffle by Rich Kienzle is a fascinating survey of the pioneers of honky-tonk, Western swing and country jazz music considers the evolution of musical styles and talents alike, from swing fiddler Spade Cooley to country musician Willie Nelson. The focus on musician interactions, collaborations and influences across genres is particularly insightful and rich in this fine history."
1,Very Disappointing,Joan Wolf has always had the ability to draw me into her stories and care about her characters. This book was a formula book that never engages. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
2,Not her best,"This one is OK. That being said the reason I wasn't crazy about this one is that this story has been written before, by other authors, and no I don't remember who at this exact moment, but the plot is predictable, the characters standard, and it's not much of a mystery. It's not one of those books you can't put down, more like-I guess I have to finish this so I can pass it on."
1,Silverbridge Review,"Joan Wolf's foray into the future and the past is a huge disappointment. Did someone else ghost write this thing? It was so unlike anything she has done in the past. Her previous books were buy without looking but that will not be the case after this fiasco.The movie star Tracey is one dimensional and hard to like despite her ""niceness to her secretary ie.personal servant"" The Present Lord Silverbridge is cold, snooty and very unsexy!! Where did Joan Wolf go? I kept asking myself this through the book, which I did not finish without skipping to the corny end.Where did the ghost fit in? She never tied it together. Not one of her characters was real or sexy. The love scenes were boring.Last but certainly not least,anorexia is really not the topic for a romance novel."
5,A fun read,"As a long time Joan Wolf fan, I was glad to see her branching out, though I hope she doesn't stop writing regencies. I liked the ghost story and the movie set in Regency times. My one complaint, and it is minor, is that I felt switching back and forth between the past and present caused the characters to be a little less fleshed out than normal. Still, Joan Wolf doesn't write bad books. Her writing style is always engaging. This is a fun book. Even Joan Wolf on her worst day is better than most of the books you see out there. Joan Wolf fans will like her newest book. If this is your first Joan Wolf, read a few of her marvelous Regencies before you make up your mind."
4,Great Book,"Great mystery,kept you in suspense, but was also a great love story. I enjoyed everything about it. Would definitely read more by this author."
4,Touching,"Ms. Freethy gives us a wonderful look into the world of Ryan Hunter, the typical bad boy who should have never come home. Or so everyone thought. He is shunned by the town except for a wonderful few. One of which is Kara Delaney and her story telling daughter Angel. These special ladies will capture the heart of the fast moving Ryan, as well as little. Angel helping to rebuild the family that Ryan, and even herself, had lost."
5,Good Read,"The book held mysteries and secrete about serval people. It was hard to put down, kept me turning the pages."
3,Disappointed,"It was a good story and had an exciting plot but I was disappointed with the graphic ""love scenes"". It would have been better if the ""love scenes"" had left more to the imagination."
4,Ryan' s Return,All the character are so different and exciting. The author keeps you thinking throughout the novel. I like that! I really enjoyed Ryan' s Return.
5,Great book!!,"Ryan's return is one of the best books I've ever read! It's heartfelt, and funny and can teach us all a little bit about the important things in life and the love of a family no matter how thick the ""blood"" is."
4,Good read.,"Good fast read. This is a good, family, romance, which people will like because the story keeps you reading and wanting more."
5,refreshing read,"This book captures your attention in the first page, and holds it throughout the book. The characters are believable because its a lot of home town life.It keeps you wanting to read just one more page. I truly enjoyed it, very refreshing."
2,Undeveloped and confusing timeline,I kept having to review the timeline of this book over and over. Certainly the author gave me the timeline over and over. I could not reconcile the characters with their actions. The characters and the story line were stereotypical and underdeveloped. The characters often did things ... out of character.
3,Cookie Cutter,"Well written yet predictable romance novel. Well developed characters, over used plot and a ghost thrown in for some added intrigue. Personally, the ghost does nothing for me. Almost a turn-off. Pleasant read. A few typos."
3,A little predictable at times.,"The story starts off with Ryan's world in upheaval and an invite to return to his former world that he doesn't like. Ultimately, Ryan returns to his home town and unfortunately this is where the story sometime lacks in dept. The characters in the story are developed well and quite likable. There is a lot of back story within the book and it can be difficult to follow at times. I felt the story would jump around and thus created a difficulty to follow. In the end, it is all very predictable - Ryan falling in love and staying and Andrew falling in love and leaving."
5,Good reading.,This book is a good and easy read. It's one of those books that you can not put down until you are to the end. I enjoyed it very much.
3,It was a quick read and a good story.,"It wasn't one of the best books I've read and I could put it down and forget about it. If you want a short, quick read that is entertaining then this is for you."
5,FANTASTIC,"Loved the plot, characters, and small town setting..Would recommend this read to everyone.Look forward to reading more by her!"
4,Ryan's Return,"An interesting mixture of emotions in this story, encompassing love,hate,pride and finally acceptance I found this and interesting book to read"
4,You don't forget where you grow up whether it's good or bad,Enjoyed the story and how important it is for families to talk to one another. Of course this involves love and danger but it was a moving story.
2,If you're over the age of 14 FORGET THIS BOOK,"Let me start by saying it's not the worse book you will ever read and if you're a guy 100% for sure skip this book - this is CHICK LIT 101,as a matter of fact this may be CHICK LIT PRE-K !!! I felt like I was reading a Life time movie directed by TeleTubbies - I honestly do not understand why people would give this book 5 stars, what were they thinking ? Bad rich boy returns home, family hates he's back in town, hooks up with local Inn keeper,natural disaster hits at exactly the same time as love, ghost magically appears wearing a scarf (guess it was cold where the ghost came from) - story line may be hokey but if it had been written for adults it may have been a great beach read but please trust me on this when I say , pass it by, read something else life's too short!Short opinion review from me:If your idea of ""watch, can't miss TV"" is Hannah Montana or Justin Bieber then this is the book for you !"
5,Really a great read!,"I was looking for a light read and this book fit the bill. I really enjoyed reading about Kara and Ryan. Ryan's Return was well written and the characters were believable. I laughed, I cried and I kept reading. This was the first time I had read anything by Barbara Freethy, but anticipate looking for her books again."
3,OK Read Contains spolier,"This story started off well, but got prdictable fast.I did feel empathy with several of the characters, but in the end, it felt like a ""Movie of the Week.""SPOILER ALERT:Would have given it 4 stars if she hadn't thrown in a ghost that only the child could see. Really, why doso many writers think they have to throw in a ghost, vampire, or werewolf? Don't people (characters) have enough real-life problems and family dramas to keep a story interesing for 300 pages?"
2,Ryan's Return - easy reading,"This book is a no brainer, and by that I mean it's brainless reading. It's a light, fluffy novel which tries to expand upon the theme of character's issues from youth somehow directing their lives today, all the while unlikely couples fall in love, father-son-brother relationships are stubbornly unresolved, add a ghost and child who can see spirits to the mix, yet still somehow it all lacked punch.In addition, I found the main female character irritating. However, some people would find this book entertaining. Not me."
5,Ryans Return,"Fantastic Book, could not put it down brillant, You just fall in love with the characteurs, and when it finished I was at a loss."
4,Fresh & Free!,"I really enjoyed this book. The author's use of dialogue was fresh, light-hearted and ""real"" in a way that is often lost on books of this genre. I felt like the rest of the world could relate to the characters. The author could have been writing about my own hometown! I fortunately purchased the Kindle edition for free and found it was well worth it and then some."
3,Pretty good,"I gave this book 3 stars, because the ending wasn't quite what I had hoped for. I don't necessarily want a book to end the way I think it will, or should- just maybe not end so unexpected. I was caught way off guard.Other than that, the book overall was a great free read. I really don't see how anyone could give this book less than 3 stars, especially if they got it for FREE!! (Although it looks like at one point it was a few dollars.)The best part of this book for me was the all of the other character situations going on throughout the book. It made it a lot more dimensional."
5,Ryan's Return,Bad boy returns home who isn't exactly bad. Great love story and how one family conquers their hate for one another.
3,Book lover,Easy read cute story that brings family into view. Moral of life etc makes your heart warm...Nice rainy day story
5,Another hit,If you are a Barbara Freethy fan this book will not disappoint. Enjoyed reading it on my kindle. Get it!
4,Romantic and adventurous,"This was a great book. The characters pull you in immediately. The romance is sweet and believable. It has a touch of the super natural which adds another dimension. An easy, good read."
4,Love and Family!,"This isnt my normal read, I dont even remember what made me read Ryans Return actually. I am glad I did though. It was a great read. I laughed quite a few times at some of Ryans one liners, and I loved that Freethy kept so many things hidden only to reveal them in the end..made it nearly impossible to put down."
4,Fantastic read,"I wasn't expecting much when I started reading the book but I ended up not being able to put it down. The story takes so many twists and turns and you never expect what is coming next. This is a fantastic read about family, love, and learning from the past."
4,great read!,Ryan's Return was an easy read and very enjoyable. I have just started reading some of BF's books and I really like her work.
4,Ryan's Return review,Enjoyed the flow and story line. Read quickly as I wanted to find out what would happen at the end.
3,Ken,I liked it. It was very cute and very enjoyable! I'll probably read it again and again. I hope you enjoy it too
3,Ryan returns to normal,This work of a great writer is fair at. It's best. Every person is dysfunctional which made it hard to know who needed changing the most! I had a hard time relating to any of the characters. I stayed with the story hoping every page would turn the story around but it did not happen. The reader that enjoys dysfunctional will love this work of a good author.
4,A good story.,Enjoyed this book. A story that could be about any ones family in any small town. A lot of families never tell their loved ones how they really feel about them. I would recommend this book.
1,waste of time,this book was one of the worst books i have read in a while. I did not like the characters and the town had no redeaming qualities. The story was predictable and overall a waste of time to read.
5,One of the Best reading....,Really very touching story. Lived with Ryan. This is my first book of Barbara Freethy. Now I am fan of her.
3,So-so storyline....not bad but not great....,"This book was just okay, not great, not awesome, but not totally horrible. If you're looking for a quick read on a rainy afternoon, then check this out. However, don't go in with any huge expectations of being blown away or impressed, especially if you're a fan of Barbara Freethy's other books, which are generally much better than this attempt."
4,Touching and Well Written,"Ryan's Return is a very enjoyable read. The characters were interesting as is the plot. I liked that it had a romantic overtone, but avoided being one of those books filled with angst ridden thoughts and soft core porn sexual scenes.I also liked the supernatural twist to the story."
5,"Great, well-developed story!","Loved the characters, the storyline... everything about Ryan's Return. Ryan and Kara are believable, as are their struggles from the past that cloud their present. Mystery, suspense, love... even the supporting characters added depth and purpose to this story and kept me turning the pages. And I loved the ending. A great read that I would definitely re-read."
1,I'm glad this book was free on the Kindle...,"and that I didn't spend a cent on it. I had a hard time getting into the book from the very beginning. I typically have a very, very hard time setting a book down but this one would sit within my Kindle, unread, for days and days before I'd attempt to pick it back up. I tried to pick it up again last night and couldn't believe when I looked at the bottom of my screen and saw that I was only 48% of the way done. This novel seems to go on forever. And although the promise of ""secrets"" kept me mildly interseted at first, I found the plot for the most part very predictable and the character lines cheesy. Many reviewers seemed to really enjoy the book but if you like your romances with a little more excitement and less cheese, I would suggest passing."
1,Trite,I am sorry I wasted 99cents on this book. The characters were whiny and boring. I found myself wishing the river featured in the story would rise quickly and wash them all away.
4,Romantic,Once I got into the book I really enjoyed it. The plot was over very predictable but the story was well written and sweet. Recommend to those that enjoy romance novels.
4,A story for the heart,"A story of family rivalry and how misunderstanding and secrets can tear a family apart. Characters are believable and fun. This is the first Barbara Freethy book that I have read, will difinetly read more."
4,Great story,"I enjoyed the story line with the ""bad boy"" returns to face the wrath of the town. Ryan and Kara are wonderful characters that you find yourself cheering for throughout the book. The only let down was the ending. I would have liked to have an epilogue to show how the characters changed over a 6 month period."
4,Enjoyed this book.,I liked the book because there was a lot of drama and you got to know the characters from reading it. It was also a quick read.
4,really enjoyed it,"I really enjoyed reading Ryan's return. Nice Light reading, he returns home the black sheep, but in the end find forgiveness and forgiving."
3,Never ending love,This tale will have you wanting to believe in everlasting love. Makes forgiveness an option when you didn't think it could be.
4,Definitely a favorite,"I have read a lot of this author's books and I have to admit that this was one if not the favorite. I look for a good story and this had it. I look for twists and turns and this book met that criteria as well. I liked the characters and their development throughout the book. The story was believable, except for the ghost story line. I understand the need for it, but it was silly. I have only one complaint about Ms. Freethy and that is that her love scenes are all exactly the same. I just skip over the love scenes and go on with the story. Otherwise, great, fast read. Now on to the next one."
4,Too much!,"A ghost, a past, a feud, a town and the river that rubs through it. This book has it all. If you enjoy the small town stuff this is your read."
3,Witty dialogue but factual gaps,"I enjoy the way Freethy writes...her words are smart and amusing, and brought a laugh now and then. But I couldn't help noticing the lack of cell phone usage in this story. Ryan got one call on his cell phone in a week. But when a newspaper contacted him they called the phone at the Gatehouse. He is a celebrity! During an emergency, Andrew tells his son to go to the garage and try to find a CB radio....seriously?? In 2011 when everyone has a cell phone? And after they return to the house at the end, where did the puppies come from?? The ghost thing got a bit silly....and sillier as it went on. But since I enjoyed the dialogue between people I will give Freethy another read. Hoping to find a lot more substance though."
4,Family story,Interesting good characters with real family story to tell and figure out. Easy read you feel like you really know them all at the end
4,Ryan's Return,"Good love story, characters were developed nicely. Barbara Freethy always writes a good story, you can depend on being entertained with her books."
5,Ryan's Return,This was a wonderful story. It made me cry at the end. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading other stories by this writer.
4,Angry River,Really enjoyed this story. The suspense of an out of control river and the way it seemed to bring families together made this a good story.
4,Ryan's Return,"I enjoyed this book very much....such a good clean book with great characters...definitely would recommend it for a read to anyone who likes a happy ending and enjoys reading about the reason Ryan and left and why his return was so important.,"
4,Enjoyable,"Well written and a good story line. No big surprises but no disappointments, either. Good, easy reading. Great way to while away the time."
4,heart warming,"Interesting characters, suspenseful at times and a good ending. It's an easy read for a rainy weekend or just to enjoy anytime."
2,Ryan's Return,I like a story that hooks me right from the beginning. This book did not do that! In fact I found it to be boring!
3,Ryan's non-return,"The reviewers are split in their critique of this book. On the one hand, the story makes for a pleasant, simple read. But for me, it was almost too simple, with a predictable storyline and plodding progress towards the predictable end. The author's turn of phrase was often annoying (to me anyway and her catch-phrases too trite or cliched (someone said cheesy)and repeated far too often. I did, however, finish the book - but then I always finish any book that I start!"
3,Good story,This is a very good story but part of it feels like it dragged on. It took the characters a while to to developers. You could tell early on in the story what the characters wanted and who they wanted it just took longer then expected. I would recommend it.
3,Enjoy,"This book is like watching the Lifetime channel. Just a great story with a good ending. It is definitely a chick book. A good read on a cold winters nite. Easy to read, hard to put down."
5,DO OVEr,This is a book i would tell all my friends to read. It leads you to a place that you could be in and be comfortable yet living on the edge also. Great Read.
3,It was pretty good,"I got this book for free back in December 2011 and I'm just now getting around to reading it. I finished it in a day, so it's not a ""thinkers"" book, but it does keep you in suspense as to what Ryan's issue is with his family. I found that I had a hard time getting into the book, but when I did (finally) it was pretty good. I don't think I would have paid too much for it had it been for sale, but free is a good price! I have to admit that I have read three of Freethy's books now and this is the one that I'm just ""okay"" on, the other's I've really enjoyed."
4,Read with popcorn!,This book took me back to great film days. It just had the feel of 50's film era and I got to cast all the actors easily. The only thing that I didn't like was the describing of a couple sex moments..(not needed)... better left to the imagination because the build up of emotions was well done.The extra little spin of the lady of the river and the child who communicates ... it just fits perfectly into the story.
5,This is a fantastic book!,"I had never read Barbara Freehy before. I took a chance & purchased it....I'm always looking for new authors to read. Once I started reading it I could not put it down...from the start it captivated you and it never let you down. It has romance, mystery and personal conflict that has you guessing what will happen next!! I am now a fan and will definitely buy more Barbara Freehy books. It's a must read !!!"
3,Just an O.K. story,"This was a little cheesy, but a good fast, predictable story. Had a touch of paranormal in it too. Not a terrific read, but a good ""filler"" type story to read in between other heavier stories. I liked it but wasn't in love with the story."
4,"started out kind of cheesy for my taste, then I couldn't put it down","Wasn't sure I was going to like this book when I first started reading it. Not a big romance novel fan. But it turned out to have a good storyline and kept me interested, wanting to know what was going to happen."
4,"Ryan,s return","One of the better romances that I have read in a long time!! Estrangement, Family reunions, love lost, adults, children, animals, relatives, river, raging emotions, family lost, family found...a little of everything,which when combined,made very good reading..."
1,Horrible language,I will never understand why the author felt the need to take the Lord's name in vain trepeatedly. Free was to expensive for this book. Didn't finish because of language
4,Loved it!,This was such a cute love story! This is the type of book that really makes you realize what is truly important in life and sometimes life takes us in unexpected direction. Must read
1,"Stated out as good story, discription of sexual intercorse ruined the book, just got trashy!","I would like to give it less.I do not want it even ""on the cloud"" of my kindle. I would not want my grandchildren to find this on Grandma's kindle Fire!"
3,3 to 3.5 stars,"This book started off pretty slow for me. It didn't pick up until the 5th or 6th chapter. Once the story started going, I had to find out what happened next. It turned out to be a pretty good book."
5,Ryans return,This was a really good book! I couldn't put it down I was even reading it on my breaks at work!!
3,Nice romance,"The plot is all right, even though there is some fantasy. The romance in the story is enjoyable, especially the dialogues."
4,Ryans return,First time I had read this author I have bought more of her books since You wanted to keep reading to see what would happen
3,Ryan's return,Loved the twists. Couldn't stop reading until the end. Wish there was a part two. All in all a good book.
4,Couldn't put it down!,I enjoyed this story. The storyline kept me in suspense and I couldn't stop reading it. The characters were very true to life and I would enjoy reading more from this author.
2,Kind of boring,I thought the story kind of dragged...I actually started reading another book before I even finished this one (with only a few pages left) that's how disinterested I became. It had the makings to be more but the whole family conflict things just seemed to drag on.
2,Kind of Boring,I found this book to be tedious. I tried to give it an honest chance and read about 10 chapters but when all was said and done I didn't really care to finish it. I like books with a little more action and pace to the plot.
1,Hoakie,Or trite. Either word would work for this book. I found most of the characters to be undeveloped. The author has them doing things which are totally out of character without adequately showing why. And the plot line was predictable and trite. Add to that a ghost who appears only to a little girl and I found myself rolling my eyes throughout most of this book. The redeeming feature of this book is that it was free for Kindle.
5,wonderful book,"What a great book. Just the right amount of romance and suspense. The puppies made it for me. BoyI can relate. I also enjoyed the kids. Oh my,little Angel was truly speaking with an angel.I can't believe it was that long of a book. I'm done and yet yearning to read more."
3,Great Read but Kindle Edition left much to be desired,I really enjoyed the storyline. It was hard to put it down as things just kept unfolding. I didn't like the Kindle version because you would change pages and the rest of the sentence would not be there on the new page.Look forward to reading more of her books!
2,Could Have Been More,"This story had the bones to be a lot better story than it ended up being.The romance was predictable, and the ending was too trite, everything tied up in a little neat bow.Threw in a ghost (I was so hoping she wouldn't go there.)It was well written, but just too shallow. Fine forlight reading before bed."
3,"ends kind of hokey, and I am not talking about a spoiler","There were no loose ends to tie up, I knew pretty quick what was going to not-to-eventually occur. Nevertheless, other than the bedroom details I skimmed by, it was an enjoyable enough read although for me somewhat incredulous, and I'm not talking about the erethral implications. Whether or not I will read another book by this author, I do not know. ""So many [books] and so little time."""
5,keeps you guessing,Developed really well. Triumph over adversity with really good relationships. xxx xxx x x x x x x x x
4,A nice read.,I really like Barbara Freethy's style of writing. I never tire of her work. Can't wait for the next one.
5,Fantastic!,"I read an awful lot, but the way this book was written is really a big surprise to me. A free book couldn't be this interesting. This completely captivated me and held my interest like no other. So many stories within stories, but tied together wonderfully. I give it a huge A, but more than that, I would say Freethy is very talented and will go far as a writer. Read the book, I did and loved it."
2,Ryans return,"found this book very interesting, going in a different direction than I thought it was going to go, found it hard to put in down"
4,Ryans Return,Very good reading on my Kindle. It was easy to read and kept me to wanting to finish the book.
4,ryan's return,a very relaxing read. This would be a great book to read at the beach or on a trip. recomend it.
5,Ryan s return,I think I found a new best author. This book was so exciting and hard to put down. Awesome weekend read.
4,Everyone loves a rebel with a heart,A bad boy who grows up into a desireable man is reunited with his past and comes home to a family he once left behind to forget. A story embrasing those who struggle with following their own path to love when other's opinions and known reputations come into light.
4,Great read!,A refreshing romantic book and easy read. The characters had depth and the book came full circle. It left me wishing the book was part of a series so I could continue to follow their lives.
4,Tear jerking love story.,It was a little slow to get into at first but it gets really good. Very sweet tear jerking love story.
5,just buy it!,"You will regret not getting this book. It is a difficult task to capture the essence of Espana. This book comes closer than any, except perhaps Don Quixote!"
5,Best culinary book,The book explains the origin of the different dishes and ingredients including their local names. It makes cooking a marvelous experience. Excellent cook book plus a magnificent coffee table book. We love it.
5,"Like having a personal Spanish chef, historian, and friend in your kitchen","I had a roommate from Madrid once who was an amazing cook (decided to be a doctor instead of a chef though sadly!), and owning this book is like having him right there on my bookshelf to read anytime I want.He would cook every Thursday for a small dinner party he started in our neighborhood, and while he was cooking he would tell everyone the history and culture behind the dish. This book does the exact same thing (but with pictures haha).How do I know that this book is the real thing? They got the story and recipe behind paella right! Even many Spaniards don't know the real story behind this dish!This book makes you care about the food you make from it."
4,Very origional sounding rock band,"I read about this band in A&P magazine, and in the Law of Inertia mag, so I decided to try them out. Boy was I glad I did! The best I can describe this album is that it sounds like a straight up riff based rock band with tons of Black Sabbath influences. I hear Black Sabbath all over this record. This isn't your basic boring verse-chorus-verse-chorus song structures. The whold cd is just awesome! The only things I don't like about this album is that 1) sometimes it sounds like the guitars are pushed ahead in the mix above the drums and bass and 2) the singer needs to let loose. Some parts he is just too whispery quiet and passive sounding.Other than that the record is fantastic!"
4,"Great band, original sound","This is one of my favorite bands, but it's easy to see why they're not greatly appreciated. I love the quirky spare lyrics and the music that's all over the place."
2,Not So Great Bibs,"Although these bibs are attractive and organic, they do not actually prevent moisture from seaping underneath to clothing...which it the purpose right? I would not purchase these again nor would I recommend to a friend."
2,Blue topaz ring,This is much smaller than I expected and there is a cut mark where the two ends of the band came together instead of it being one solid piece.
1,waste of money,"I bought this hoping it was a good furniture polish, with the added bonus of repeling dust. It did neither. It didn't repel dust at all, in fact I think it attracted dust. Plus it also left a sticky residue on the wood and left my furniture looking dull. There was absolutely no shine to the wood anymore. It made my furniture look horrible. This product doesn't do anything it claims to do. In fact your furniture will look even worse after using it. Don't waste your money."
1,Birder's Guide to Northern California,Don't waste your time or money on this book. The information was to generalized and did not include specifics. I have never experienced a book with such vague and poor directions to birding sites. Too bad that there is not an ABA guide to birding Northern California.
1,Northern California birding trip frustration,"I'm afraid I'll have to agree with what's been said about this book. I took a trip earlier this month to Northern California and my friend and I found this book only mildly useful. It does provide general information, however for anything more than that, another book is needed. Seasonal variation is ignored in some site descriptions and detailed directions to sites that require them are absent. There are no bar-charts to tell when a species is common, rare or even present, only a very general checklist in the back. Northern California is a large area to cover with a birding guide, so I can see why this book may be thin on detail. I think a much better bet would be to try John Kemper's ""Birding Northern California"". We saw this at the Pt. Reyes visitor's center near the end of our trip and certainly regretted not having it the whole time. Until an ABA/Lane guide comes out for this region, I think Kemper's is the best there is. Good birding!"
1,Not on my wavelength - worst guide I have seen,"I found this book very frustrating. I often drive up Southern California using the excellent ABA guide and as soon as I hit Northen California it is like navigating in a fog. The directions are terrible and frequently I end up with a detailed map trying to work out where the site I am aiming for is located. Each chapter covers far too much ground to be possible to follow easily.The 2nd major fault is there is no bar charts and checklist showing seasonal variation of numbers, frequency of occurance etc. It makes it very difficult to figure out what one is supposed to be looking for and when."
1,Little guidance in this guide,"Vague, inaccurate, partial: possibly European birdwatchers are spoiled for choice, but this guide is of so little practical use that you should avoid spending money on it. As the American reviewer suggested, the Kemper book is far more informative, accurate and vale for money. Hate posting negative reviews but felt the need on this one couldn't be ignored.Sorry."
4,Great shape and push-up,"I love this bra. The shape and lift it gives is so natural and comfortable. The only thing I don't like is that it stretches out after a few months. Not that much, but it makes a difference when I'm barely a 32."
3,Oooh Cleavage!,This thing makes my boobies look nice. Not too padded and gives good support. Although i find that it is a bit uncomfortable after a long day at school.
4,Love the fit! Color is tough.,I have this bra in nude but it is too dark to wear under white shirts. I would suggest the nude color for someone of Indian or Hispanic decent. I thought the champage would be more of my coloring but it has more of a pink hue than a skin tone color.
4,bra,My husband ordered this for me since I could not find my size at the store. I fit great and did just what it is supposed to do. Great for getting dressed up with low neck clothes.
5,AMAZINGGGGGGG BRA,This is seriously the best bra ever...I wear a size 34C and it really adds a cup. Its a great everyday bra and i love it!
3,Teddy Bears by Judy Sparrow,"The photographs in this book are superb, but otherwise it has less pages than a magazine."
4,Great work.,It is always fascinating to look back at OS/2 to see what a miserable sub-set of IBM's product Windows represents.
4,Food Tastes Great!,"I love this! The food tastes great even without seasonings.It is hard to clean if you let it sit too long.Otherwise this unit is great, food tastes great, and no more dry chicken!"
4,George Foreman,"I think the George Formann grill is easy to clean! If you clean it as soon as you're finished cooking, the grease and everything just slides right off. It also makes things taste great! I thought that things would be dry, but the food tastes great. I use it for chicken, portabello mushrooms, filets, etc. I enjoy everything we make on the Foreman grill."
3,wedding gift,This was a wedding gift so I didn't use it but wasn't overly impressed with the bells and whistles on this machine; not sure it's worth the 3 stars...but you are forced to note a star rating!Personally I have a Hamilton Beach with a timer that works just great!
4,Does wonders in a pinch,"The larger grill is better made, easier to clean, and more convenient when making a family meal. I use it to cook steaks or whatever, right out of the freezer, in fact. Like the other grills, this one doesn't do well with really thick cuts of meat unless you keep a close eye on it.For burgers, its perfect, and veggies and anything else you'd like to grill when it's unseasonable to do so outside!"
4,We Love It,We love this grill so much. It is easy and quick. The only down side is cleaning it after since you can't just stick it in the sink. If clean up were easy I'd give it 5 stars.
4,Good but a pain to clean,"It is a nice unit, always cooks the food well. It is very easy to use and I use it at least 2-3 times a week. The only pain is that grilling bases do not remove for easy cleaning. Especcially if you are cooking something with sticky sauce, clean the thing is a pain. Other than that it is pretty good."
3,"EDITED BY, not written by","A few essays here are good (esp. one on economics) but on the whole this volume is rather weak. The reader experiences a wide range of essayists and topics, rather than just the best ones. This book really suffers from its intellectualism and its eclecticism: to wit, one essay had to do with conservatism in architecture or urban planning -- it was such a horrible mishmash of nothing that I forget what exactly it was about. Often I thought of the term ""ivory towers"", which is something I usually associate more with liberalism.Buckley can be a very good writer, but here he merely selects the works of others. The result is mixed and more often bad than good."
4,Intriguing Voice,"I first heard this album in a used record store that I have since come to rely upon for introducing me to artists that I would never hear of otherwise. When I walked in that day, I thought they were playing Tori Amos at first, then it sounded like Bjork, and then it changed again to something even more distinct. I couldn't stand it, so I went to the counter and asked, ""Who the hell IS this??"" I was really caught by her voice, because it recalls several of the female singers I find most interesting, so I had to buy the album.I haven't been disapointed with it. The other reviewers are right to point out that the whole album has a melancholy lullaby feel to it; however, I find new subtleties distinguishing each of the tracks every time I listen. It's a great rainy-day stay-inside-and-look-at-old-pictures album. Worth the money, so check it out!"
3,check it out,"Tania May-Bowers has been around for a while. She has been known to hang out with Prefuse 73 and El-P. Her too cool music recalls the chill-out sounds of Morcheeba and Massive Attack. This record takes all the hip elements of techno and hiphop and brings it to the people. ""Lightning & Thunder"" is probably the best track here. Anything Prefuse 73 does is very interesting. Prefuse is the hippest cat around. Maybe Via Tania can do more pop music in the future? Some of the songs seem like sketches of good ideas. When you get to the song ""True"" towards the end, you wonder why Tania doesn't do more stuff like this."
4,Under A Different Sky,"If this is the first full length record from Via Tania, I can only be excited as to what the future holds.This record took me a few listens to get to know but once it I did, it took a firm hold and only gets better and better.There is a mix of genres and some heartbreaking singing styles, but I think this girl has roots in indierock and isnt all about being Chocolate Industries' Ashanti or whatever they say in reviews.There have been weirder comparisons than that even, but we should just see this as a completely new and unique songwriter on the block and sink into the record like it knowingly wills us to."
2,"Beautiful Music, Boring Vocals","This album is kind of a post trip hop melange. It's got the acoustic guitars, the slow, hip hoppish beats- your standard issue chick music on the mmody tip.Via Tania's vocals are what bring the whole thing down. She's very warbly and oftentimes sits on TOP of the music instead of meshing with it. Which is too bad, because the music is great. This would make a nifty instrumental album."
3,not what I expected,had much more of a religious focus than I expected after reading an article on the book
5,Great Help!,Rena Greenberg's book was very helpful to me. Her approach to weight loss is both insighful and helpful. I find her method to be very practical.
2,Another weight loss book,"This book may be helpful for younger people who haven't already read about and experienced dieting. For everyone else, it's just another diet book with pretty much the same advice as others. A good book if it's your first."
4,Good Reading,"Having read the highlights in an anthology of his work put together by his daughter, it is nice to have the complete volume."
5,Extraordinarily influential text on MLK and others,"For the secular or the religious, this classic text from Howard Thurman is the philosophical foundation of liberation theology. Concise, eloquent and as relevant today as it was decades ago under the arms of Martin Luther King, Jr, this is incredibly inspiring reading on the moral imperatives facing those who believe in any combination of religion, God, justice or change. A book that even non-Christians love and appreciate for its brutal honesty about the hypocrisy of ""organized"" religion and a challenge for those seeking liberation in any form."
4,Christopher Hogwood Klassizistische Moderne Volume3,"I was so happy to find a recording of Casella's Scarlattiana. It is a wonderfully inventive and charming work, which deserves to be much more well known. The performance is excellent! The other works on the CD by Stravinsky and Malipiero make for a wonderful program."
5,Best Nature sounds ever,This rendition of nature and music is my favorite. I already had one for myself but needed to get another one for my daughter. When my granddaughters stay the night they love to go to sleep with this playing. It has many animal and bird sounds along with thunder and rain. The music is wonderful and very calming. Puts them right to sleep. Love it.
5,From a Sub acolyte,I studied Russian under the tutalage of Doctor David Murphy. He in turn was a student of Dr Rado Lencek. So I guess I am somewhat connected to the author. I highly recommend all of the late Doctor's works as they are the best on Slovene study currently available in English. The only problem is the price and or availability of his titles. Derbyshire has a good reference grammer that breaks the highly academic Lencek down for the layman.
1,Waste of money.,"Not as pictured ... bottle, frame and box are tiny and made of cheap plastic. Do not waste your money."
3,Random,Album is pretty good. But it's really random on how everything was put together. Never knew the cd existed till I saw it at Best Buy. I took a risk and bought it. Not bad
1,bad writing,this book is to boring it put me to sleep in no time the writing is like your reading a college book 500 pgs it talks about the frence to munch
1,Do Not Buy,"Although this product looks good, it is a waste of money. The unit worked for about 3 days then I noticed that it would not receive data from the remote unit. I reset and discovered both units and it worked for about 24 hours, then I would reset and discover both units again and it will now work from 1 to 6 hours even after trying all three channels. After about a month I noticed it was no longer receiving the time/date automatically and now it will only work in manual mode. Also the batteries in the base unit only last just over one month. If I could I would return this product."
3,Not a fan,"Calls itself a ""weather station"" and ""self-setting clock"", but really the only feature that seems to be reliable on the unit is the thermometer portion...and what I paid is significantly more than I would have paid for just telling me the temperature. It's a bit disconcerting when it shows that it's raining on a sunny day, and I could not get a signal for the atomic clock even standing outside. Every time I reset it, I have to go through the steps to reset the clock/calendar. Now I don't even bother...not worth the purchase price."
3,works great but non-existent customer service,"product works great, but I've e-mailed Oregon Scientific well over a month ago about which additional sensor I should purchase that would be compatible with the weather station and haven't gotten a response. I guess they don't want my money? Oregon Scientific's customer service sucks! I can only imagine that if I have trouble with my device I'm not going to get any help from them. I'll be S.O.L. But if their products are perfect, no worries, right......So if you're concerned about customer service, you've been warned."
2,Some problems,My wireless unit came with problems on which has erratic humidity and temperature data. I am keeping touch to Oregon to see if they can replace it. But it is frustating when you receive a item with defect...
4,It's a great unit.,We really like Oregon Scientific products. This one is a great unit. It's nice to have an atomic clock and I like how it has you set your elevation in the unit. I just wish the display for each of the sections was larger. The numbers are all about an inch high and it would be nicer to have a larger display. Otherwise everything else is great. Easy to set up.
3,"Too bad if you want it to work overseas, or in a high city","It works, but with limited functionality. The atomic clock feature needs that the unit is installed within certain distance of some location in the US. The remote unit displays the tempreature only in english units (F instead of C). The barometer only can be setup to a limited height, that is way down of the height of the city where i live. Probably that's the reason why the wheather forecast is so inacurated, so if you live in the US, in a city just above the sea level, this product may work for you, otherwise, look somewhere else."
2,Better have tiny screwdrivers if you buy this unit!,"Just got this yesterday and all looks great -- this would have been a 4-star review. But when I tried putting the batteries in the remote unit, I found that the two bottom screws that remove the battery compartment are so tiny and so deeply recessed that not a single screwdriver in my house comes close to fitting it. Now I've got to buy a new screwdriver set just to install the batteries??! Terrible design. Shame on Oregon Scientific, which normally makes pretty good stuff."
4,Oregon Scientific BAR608HGA Wireless Weather Station and Self-Setting Clock,Works fine. Accurate and easy to use.
3,Rain Or Shine?,"Had this a couple years. Really actually does a pretty darn good job. I bought it as a toy, maybe all it it good for here in San Diego with OUR ""weather""? But I use it, I like it!"
4,Works as expected,"I've had this for almost 2 years. It does exactly what it says it will do. I have to change batteries in the remotes about every 9 months. Maybe once a year in the base.The only problem I could mention is that I have one (of the three I have connected) remote that seems to read the humidity low. Not a problem with the unit as sold, but with one remote.Also, you can buy an extra remote for these at your local Radio Shack for less than Amazon sells them."
5,It works quite well and I like it a lot,"I have three of these. Well, one is still in the box and one is already 3+ years old. They are pretty accurate temperaturewise and are acceptable humiditywise. The latter never seem to be accurate no matter what digital and/or mechanical unit I tried so my expectations are not too high.The atomic clock works only when the reception is perfect. In one of my rooms I have one of these plus a wall atomic clock. The latter always syncronizes whereas the former never. In other rooms it works OK.Despite some shortcomings, I am very satisfied."
3,"""What's the Weather Here?""","That cold front without a nameAnywhere I'd know his face.In this citythe climate's my favorite.I've seen those rainclouds.I see them every day.Seen snow fall outsidelooking for a place to hideAnd the father, the kid half naked (save for his Oregon Scientific BAR608HGA Wireless Weather Station and Self-Setting Clock)and said to myself'O, what's the weather here?'I'm tired of the excusesthe meteorologist uses,it's their job I stay out of it,but who gave them the right to do this?We live on Morgan Street;The accu-forecast can't be beat.But kids can be beaten...by their parents, unless they can more accurately predict the weather, like they could with Oregon Scientific BAR608HGA Wireless Weather Station and Self-Setting ClockAnswer me and take your time,what could be the awful crime he could do at such young an age?Except dress inappopriately for precipitation?"
3,"Good book, but bad Science",The beginning was slow and what would happen if global warming went unchecked was more science fantasy than anything. Basically meaning the Earth wouldn't turn into a incredibly dry desert world. We'd instead have an ice age. If it did and most of the vegetation on Earth was dead the rest of the world would die as well because of the fact there would be nothing to make oxygen.Beyond all that I thought the book entertaining and I liked the interactions between the different characters.Overall I liked the book.
4,A Nice way to put some Italian spice in your life,Nice recipes that are easy to understand. It is nice to be able to find recipes that make vegertarian diets interesting and tasty.
2,beginner,"I guess I was expecting this to be a step areobic workout with a building routine. It is not that. It is strength mixed with a little cardio. A good combo but if you are advanced, this will be easy for you."
2,disappointing... in my opinion,"To sum it up, ""Aerobic Body Shaping"" is not as good as the older firm videos (Such as the Cross-trainer series and Total body shaping mix)The cardio segments are too slow, repetitive, boring, and stiff. I couldn't get my heart rate up. The lifting segments were OK, except for some of the lunges that were awkwardly executed on the incline step. The movements were so odd that I couldn't concentrate on any particular area of the lower body.At last, the abdominal segment was terrible.The instructor suggests that you straighten and extend your legs out to do the crunches. You end up just working your hip flexors and compressing your lower spine.I suggest you bend your knees to 90 degrees and push your belly button towards the floor, than proceed with the crunches."
3,"Mostly strength, repetitive","This is a quick, mostly strength workout. Not a lot of cardio - my heartrate is around 40-50% of maximum during most of the workout. Plus, it's pretty short. The routines are pretty basic, and get boring quickly. I find most of The Firm routines pale in comparison to CIA workout videos."
5,Instant Classic,"This collection of performances is an instant classic. Just as argentine tango music is timeless, these dancers and their choreographies have set the standard for excellence for decades to come. There are many styles and personalities to choose from on this DVD. One may like some more than others, but they all have one thing in common - they are uniquely argentine."
5,Again and again,"I am a tango instructor at Fred Astaire Studios, but dance Argentine tango too. I loved the routines, especially the older dancers. I lent it to my girl friend who loves tango, and she won't give it back. She's in love with this DVD. So I'm buying another one."
5,Great Tribute CD,"All these songs sound good even though they aren't the originals. The only ones that weren't as good as Britney are ""Baby One More Time"" and ""Sometimes."" Since this is a 2-disc, 2 songs aren't worth not buying it."
4,An excellent movie of Mexico's golden age of filmmaking,"It is a movie about the love and interest of a clergymen to the destituded children. Understanding the suffering that these children have experienced, this good men, full of patience and wisdom, achieves his goal of nurturing, loving, and educating these destituded children in the orphanatory that he developed, ""La Ciudad De Los Ninos""."
4,This book is well written. It's a great tool for theologians,"I found this book to be an eyeopener for me. I am a student at a small Bible college in Manitoba, Canada, and in our Intro to Theology class, it is one of our required readings. I found a lot of what Thielicke said about young theologians is dead on. I felt like he was actually talking directly to me. I was confused by some of what he said, but I believe that this is a good book for anyone young or old, a new theologian or a more experienced one. I myself am not a theolgian, but am a musician. This book has helped me understand and desire to learn more about God."
4,"This book, though small in size, is large in content.","The book contains an important message for those interested in the pursit of theologies. Translated from German, it maintains the integrity of the thoughts expressed by the author. Theologians are admonished to not overwhelm the people with the use of knowledge just acquired. A caution about losing focus on the message of the Scriptures being God speaking to mankind is offered. Some may need a dictionary in hand due to some of the words used in the book. One who heeds Thielicke's advice will avoid many mistakes common to young theologians. Don Laughary"
1,specialized and difficult,Definitely not for beginning translators although it would hold the interest of people with an advanced interest in translation from Spanish to English or with a passion for Infante Cabrera's work.
4,I'm glad I bought this can opener,"It starts opening easily. It's great looking.It tears off the top half inch of the can's label which then gets caught in the gears, so I remove the label before opening it.The knife sharpener is manual and not effective. The bottle opener works fine.The magnet is too weak to hold most can tops."
5,I love this can opener!,"I just had my kitchen remodel finished and replaced many of my older small appliances. This can opener is my favorite, because it looks great in my new kitchen...but it is also dependable and sturdy. It has not failed me yet! Opens large and small cans with minimal effort and without a mess. Highly recommended."
2,Breaks too soon,"I got this can opener about a year ago, and just loved it while it worked. I loved the idea I could color coordinate it with my kitchen, and it had a nice design. But it recently broke. I saw something fly out when I tried to use it, and found it was a small pin that is needed to activate the motor. Being very small and plastic we could not glue it or fix it ."
4,West Bend Opener,"A very sturdy can opener, not light in weight. Does an excellent job and is nice looking. Worth purchasing if you want a good heavy duty opener."
1,Returned so dont have knowledge of how well this works.,When I realized this item was not cutting the can as rimless I returned it before using it.
1,can opener,"I got the can opener for a Christmas gift for this year, so didn't use it. It's already wrapped for person."
1,Piece of junk...,"while it lasted, it could only open perfect, smaller cans, it was VERY noisy. After 5 months of light use the gears stopped moving.Now using my old 10 year old ugly opener.Buy at your own risk!"
5,wow!,"I don't usually get all excited about an appliance, but this one is superb. Elegant. Space Saving. Efficient. Clean. I wish there were space on my countertop to display it, for it is as decorative as it is useful. I've had it 3 years, and it still works perfectly. A+"
2,expensive defective model,"I bought this can opener March 2010. After 1 month the automatic shut off stopped working. Since then sometimes I have trouble putting it back together after cleaning. The concept is great but guality control is not good. If I had not let this go past the warranty date, I would send back. I will not buy another Weatbend product again!"
5,sleek and super,"This can opener, with its sleek design, has a quiet yet powerful motor. Short and tall cans fit underneath easily. There's even a bottle opener and a knife sharpener, too. However, the BEST feature is that the blade mechanism is removable and is dishwasher safe."
2,"Looks nice, hard to use.","Once you can get the can to start, it opens fine, but man, what a job it is to get the can properly lined up. We replaced an antique opener (that worked sooooo easily) that had finally gotten too dull, but not sure this is a keeper, though there were high ratings for this one.I don't really see giving this any more than 2 stars. wish I had the option to try it before I bought it...Could be I'm a spaz, but my wife, an MD and very handy can't even get a can started, not a machine for those who are patience challenged..."
5,Excellent stuff,The best can opener I ever used. Easy holds a can so you don't have to try few times how it happens with other openers. Looks very attractively. The attached bottle opener and sharpener for knives (at the back side) are very handy.
2,Ok,"Not a good can opener. It tears the paper on the can, which is very frustrating, not to mention time consuming to clean up. I would have returned it, but the shipping wasn't worth it."
4,Excellent can opener,"Performs well and quiet too. The housing is plastic and the base thatlooks chrome is plastic also (that's why only 4 stars) but still solid.the cutter assembly is all metal parts. After piercing the can, you just let go, no need to hold the can or the lever, opens the can then stops when the lid is completly cut off. I tried this with a 6oz can of tomatopaste and a 36oz can of whole tomatos with no problem, although I imagine heavier cans might need to be held to keep opener from tipping.Made in China. West Bend only carries 1 part - the entire cutting assembly for 24.99, $5 less than the opener itselfcomes in 5 colors black, blue, red, white, chrome. Plastic never looked so good."
4,For me there was a long learning process,"Maybe because it is my first electric can opener but it took a about three weeks to finally get the hang of using this device. I finally figured out how to line up the ""guide pin"" with the edge of the can and now I am successful the first try most of the time. One reviewer complained about curls of label paper making a mess on her counter. I find that happens if I keep pressing the lever down even after the wheel and blade have engaged. If I let up on the lever (as instructed) and just let the machine do its thing then the only paper curl is one small one that comes off right at the beginning of the process. Today I bought a big can of grapefruit juice and I'll be glad when I'm ready to open it that the opener is so tall. I'm glad I bought this can opener."
3,It is ok but I would change it a little,This can opener opens cans of various sizes easily but what I don't like is that you have to raise the magnet that catches the lid as you put the can up to it & it also ALWAYS makes a mess if the can has a paper label on it. It tears part of the paper off as it cuts the lid open. Otherwise it works ok. I would really like it if it didn't have these two annoying features.
4,"Solid, looks great, easy clean, autostop flaky",Title says it all. Looks great in our stainless-style kitchen. Heavy enough to be stable. Faceplate pops out easily for simple clean up. Only complaint is that the autostop doesn't work often. No big deal -- recommend purchase.
2,Not made in USA,I read that West Bend was still produced in USA. This can opener is not. It is made in China. Very disappointed.
3,Loved it till it Died,"I really loved this can opener until it died on me, without warning. I hadn't dropped it, gotten it wet or misused it. In fact, I barely use it. I could go a whole week w/o touching it. It is cute and works well as the others have stated. But one day I got nothing. It wont pull the can up and from the lil grip that activates the opener, I tried everything. Very frustrating. It did last 3 years, so I gave it three stars. I was going to replace it with another, but I see someone else here had the same trouble."
5,The Best Can Opener I Ever Bought,"I have had four can openers in the last ten years and Nothing worked properly. I read the many reviews and they looked really good. I made the leap and put in my order. I opened the box, it looked very elegant and well designed. But my main thought,""Is this really going to work? Will I have to struggle opening all the different sizes?"" I can't tell you the delight I felt when everything opened perfectly, large and small cans. This is the can opener to buy! You have different colors to choose from. Thank you to West Bend for manufacturing a quality product and Amazon for selling it."
3,Great can opener as long as it lasts,"I love this CanOpener and the fact that you can take the cutting head assembly out and throw it in the dishwasher. I like it well enough that when the first one broke I bought a second one. However now the second one after about four years has also broken in the same part. There's a little plastic piece that activates the motor when you push down on the handle.This is obviously a design flaw since the small plastic part that broke is too small and used too much to be able to glue it back together successfully, I feel. Tomorrow I'm going to call West Bend and see if I can convince them to sell me a little five cent plastic part so that I can fix this can opener. I know you can buy new cutting heads, which is really great idea, however they cost about five dollars less than a whole new can opener. Wish me luck!"
5,Best can opener....period,"Not only is the appearance of the product superior to its ""other"" competitors but its performance has no match. We have gone through 4 different brands of its competitors and have realized there is no competition from the other products....it absolutely leaves the others in the dust! It accepts all cans from large to the smallest without any ""hic-cups"" and retains the can's covers leaving a truly clean cut. Without hesitation would recommnend The West Bend over all others."
4,very pleased,"Storage for excess cord, nice appearance, solid built, works as well as I had hoped it would. Well worth the money."
1,Motor will outlast the cheap cutter assembly,We had this can opener for a few years but eventually a small plastic piece broke so even though the motor is fine it needs a new cutter assembly. They cost as much as a new can opener....go figure.
1,Junk!,"I don't know if mine is defective, but it is definitely junk. 1 the blade shaves through the paper on the outside of the can. 2 sometimes it stops in the middle and the can has to be repositioned in order to finish cutting. 3 the top often falls straight into the can after it has been cut off instead of sticking to the magnet. I have never had a can opener so bad. I can't comment on the knife sharpener because I don't use it."
2,Sloppy,I have always liked the products put out by West Bend until now. The can opener is difficult to have it accept the can. Once it starts to operate it shreds the paper surrounding the can and quite often the paper ends up in the can. I have never had this much difficulty with a can opener.
5,Best Can Opener I've found,"I've lost track of how many can openers I've purchased over the years that have either fallen apart or been really difficult to use. So when I decided to chuck to old can opener I did some research and the West Bend got a lot of praise so I decided to try it. Well, it has certainly lived up to the praise. It's easy to use, opens cans every time and is relatively quiet. And if that isn't enough, it looks good too. I highly recommend it."
5,SATISFIED,Very satisfied with Can Opener. Had a few poor experiences with Christmas Shopping from internet sellers this year. Last year (2009)was perfect with all purchases but the business decline must have affected this years service.
2,Can Opener-West Bend,I am not too happy with this can opener. It is good looking but not very reliable. Very difficult to get the can attached most of the time. Often takes up to 4 or 5 tries. I use it daily for my cat and dog food cans and I wanted something that was more efficient.
4,Great Can Opener/Manual Knife Sharpener,I purchased the red version and love the color and how the can opener works but was disappointed in the knife sharpener. My old can opener has a grinding wheel that is turned by the opener's motor and it really sharpens knives. I can sharpen both sides of a knife by running it on both sides of the wheel. The West Bend sharpener does not have this feature. It is simply plastic that you pull the knife blade through. The West Bend description did not explain how the knife sharpening component works so I hope this helps someone. I will keep it because it is a good can opener but I'll have to hang on to my old one for the knife sharpener.
4,Nice can opener,This is a really quiet can opener. It does tend to be a little top heavy with shorter cans but the quietness and ease of operation makes up for it.
5,Does what it says,"It opens cans, it's easy to clean, it looks nice sitting on my countertop. Really can't ask for anything more!"
5,This is the one!,"This is the can opener I've been looking for. I'm sick and tired of buying cheap electric openers that don't work or that I have to fight with to get them to open a can! I have fibromyalgia and using a manual opener is not an option. This little beauty works easily with little effort. Thank you, West Bend!"
5,Awesome Can Opener,This can opener replaced some very poorly designed manual can openers. I was skeptical about an electric can opener but after some research decided to give this one a try. Works great. Classic design with removeable head for cleaning which is a very nice feature. This can opener is lightweight and looks great sitting on the counter. I would definitely recomend this can opener to everyone :)
4,Works Well,"I've always disliked can openers sitting on my kitchen countertops. Therefore, I've always had a cordless opener that I could store away in the cabinet. I bought this can opener out of necessity after my Black and Decker cordless opener died. It is large but I actually really like it. I ordered the stainless steel looking one albeit it is not stainless steel but I knew that when I bought it. It is nice looking and matches my other stainless products. It is very quiet and seems to work well. I've only had it a short time but overall I'm pleased and would highly recommend the West Bend can opener."
5,Excellent Countertop Can Opener!,"This can opener is wonderful. The color red pops my decor perfectly and the can opener is tall and attractive. It opens large can without tipping over and it doesn't tear the paper off cans. The knife sharpener is exceptional as well and there is a bottle opener on the back, too. Definitely worth the money. Highly recommend it!"
5,Awesom,"I've trying to find a good can opener for a while and this is it! I finally found it when I purchased this West Bend Electric can opener. Not only it matches my kitchen style and appliances with it's stylish black and stainless steal look, but it does the job and does oh so well. There is not a can that it cannot open. I've tried anything from small tomato paste to a super sized can of mushrooms. It's not just opening it but it's powerful magnet holds the can in place as well. I've only been using it for a month but I am pretty sure I will not touch another can opener after this. I will definitely recommend it to anyone who is tired of using regular can opener."
5,Buy it!,Great product! Love the bottle opener on the back! works great! Crazy not to buy this product!
5,Great can opener!,"I did some research online to see what the best can opener out there was. The West Bend 77203 had the best ratings. I asked my husband to get it for me for Christmas, which he did. It's great! I cook a lot and was tired of struggling with the hand can openers. The West Bend is a cinch. My kids actually want to help open the cans now! The price on Amazon.com is the best I found anywhere. For some reason, my husband could not find it in stores here in Orlando. It was not at Target, Walmart, Home Depot, Lowes, etc. There were other places to order it by mail, but they were higher than Amazon. I highly recommend it and love the chrome look."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this can opener because of its wonderful reviews. I bought the chrome version, which is pretty (1 star). It is tall enough to open tall things (star 2). And it can open large things like the huge size can of coffee (star 3). It rips the paper off any can that has paper, like tuna or canned vegetables. As the blade goes round and opens the lid, a scroll of paper crumbles into bits all over the counter (- 1 star). Also, it pops the liquid out of the can shortly after it begins its round (- star) so I have crumbled paper bits in tuna water or canned tomato water all over my white countertop. In short, it makes a mess. Though pretty, I will be donating this baby and getting something that just opens a can without the messy side effects."
2,Magnet broke off 2 weeks after warranty ran out!,"Purchased from Amazon Nov. 2010 and it was great while it lasted, and attractive too. We are not big users of canned goods, so it was used occasionally for soup and tunafish cans, opened 3 cans per week on average. So I am very disappointed that the magnet part broke off just 2 weeks after the 1 year warranty expired. Ok, so technically it still opens cans, but without the magnet, lids fall into the soup. VERY ANNOYING!!!!I went to Westbend.com, and of course the magnet itself cannot be replaced, you have to get a whole new cutting assembly. Well I had paid only $24.99 (with free shipping on Amazon Prime) for the WHOLE CAN OPENER, and a replacement cutting assembly costs.....$24.99 !!! Plus $7.95 shipping!Needless to say, I'm looking for a new can opener, but won't buy West Bend again. I cannot recommend any appliance that lasts only a year."
2,ATROCIOUS customer service,"Better hope nothing goes wrong.FIVE emails on a can openers warranty.Every time I supplied them for what they asked for, they asked for something else.Obviously their policy is to frustrate the cusomer long enough until they give up.By the way the replacement head for the opener, cost more than the whole thing."
4,West Bend Electric Can Opener,"Works Great, we will now see just how long it lasts! Our last can opener by another manufacture only lasted two years."
5,Just now getting around to reviewing this...,"We ordered it in the cobalt a couple of years ago and it's still going strong! Attractive little devil, too."
5,New Can Opener!,"Works great, clean cuts and really quite! Nice! Would recommend it to anyone! Easy to operate as well! Great price too!"
4,Works great - looks good,"Works very well with big and small cans. Love the removable ""works"" section for easy cleaning. The locking feature is new for me (last new can opener was 30 years ago) and it is nice. You get it started and can walk away. When finished, it holds the can in place until you want it. Magnet grabs every lid I've tried so far. Don't know what else I'd like as far as functionality.Only downside is that the the silver plastic is plastic. It if was metal, this would be the best looking can opener. Since it is plastic, it is good looking but not great looking on the counter in a stainless kitchen."
5,Excellent electric can opener,Highly recommend. Good for large cans too. Xx xx xx xx cx xx xx xx zz zz zz zz zz
2,Fell apart!,"A few months after the one year warranty was through, I was opening a can and just couldn't get it to lock on. This was a problem that had occurred now and then over the past few weeks, but was easily overcome with a few tries. This time, the blade and a little gear fell out onto the counter and that was the end of the West Bend 77203 Electric Can Opener. No forcing or jamming was involved - they literally just fell out and I stood there as confused as you probably are reading this.Bottom line - it was good while it lasted, but I did expect it to last longer than this. Going forward, I think I'll stick with the manual opener."
2,Didn't hold up,"I really liked this can opener for tall cans. It worked very well...until it didn't. I got it in February 2011, and by May 2012, the gears had fallen out. I tried to fix it, but my ""fix"" didn't last long either. Nice looking, but I'm thinking I'll save my counter space and just go back to using a manual can opener."
2,West Bend Electric Can Opener,Poor quality; received the can opener from Amazon and lasted about a week; opened about 4 or 5 cans before it stopped working. It got stuck on a can while opening it and i had to unplug it for it to stop making a piercing sound. Plugged it back in and all it would do is buzz and not open cans. Returned to Amazon.
1,"worked fine for a little over 3 months, then the motor gave out","For $38 and change, it seems like you ought to at least get past the manufacturer's warranty period (1 yr.). This particular can opener could just be a lemon, since it's gotten generally good reviews, but I certainly can't recommend it, especially at that price. I probably could have rented one for 3 months at a cost of less than $5; buying it, I paid about $13 for each month that it worked."
5,Best Ever Owned,"This can opener looks great sitting out in my kitchen. Almost like a piece of art. But the best part, it works wonderfully. I am extremely pleased. I got this because I was not able to use a manual opener any longer, due to arthritis. Now I open cans cleanly and with ease."
1,disapointed,"Bought a comparable model several years ago, used regularly and just found the plastic actuator tab broke off. Went looking for a replacement cutter assembly part and found it is $25. We won't be buying West Bend products in the future."
3,"not bad for the money, but it has a few annoying traits","More than adequate power, and nicely finished (in red), but like most red-heads, it's a little quirky. . .The opener tends to shread the edges of certain cans' labels, and occasionally those bits of paper end up in the can's contents. No big deal, in most respects, if one is able to pick all of the paper debris out of the food before emptying the contents into a cooking pan, etc. But, there's also the unpleasant thoughts of who handled that particular can's label during the manufactruing, packing, shipping, & shelf-stocking/checking-out process, plus how many shoppers may have also handled that can before it was purchased? Also, the operator must manually align the magnetic lid feature as they line up the opener's cutting wheel w/ the lip of the can. Kinda clumsy, and poor design, in my opinion. . ."
4,A solid entry,I got this after noticing all the under cabinet units are kind of fugly. This makes a nice addition to the kitchen aestetically and is tall enough for nearly any can you'll need to open. Nice precision operation. Feels very well put together and rugged. I only took a star off because I'd love to have a knife sharpener feature on the back of it.
1,nice-looking but bad can opener,"I got 14 months of use out of this nice-looking can opener so maybe I should be satisfied?? I don't think so. On previous occasions when it stopped working, I was able to get it going again. No such luck this time. It's nice looking but I give up; it's going into the trash."
3,not stainless steel!,"I have to say I was disappointed. This is big- very big for the counter....I was willing to look past that because I wanted a stainless steel can opener to match my stainless steel appliances. I should have just got the $30 one at the local store- would have been cheaper, smaller, and I know it was stainless steel. The whole thing is silver plastic except the actual part that opens the cans. I really should have taken it back- but my old can opener broke and figured since it was already here I would use it. My husband does like the bottle opener feature on the back and it works fine- just now what I was expecting."
1,Not Worth Buying,"The first one that came in lasted 1 month. The threads on the geared wheel stripped out. I was sent a replacement cutting head attachment. It didn't work good either. Rather than getting a 3rd replacement head, I did some mechanical work on the head myself, and got it working to my satisfaction. Besides the cutting head being poorly manufactured, the motor will stall out on cans with extra heavy steel. And the cutting blade is dull."
4,West Bend 77203 Electric Can Opener,"I would have given this produst 5 stars, but I had trouble opening a small can of black olives and had to use a hand opener. It could have been me because I have had no problems since then."
4,"Looks beautiful, cuts fast.","Beautiful design looks great and is compact on counter top. The tall height accommodates almost any can. The blade cuts heavy lids quickly (important if you are quantity cooking and have lots of cans to open at a time) and the lid magnet grips the loose lid tightly (almost too tightly). It can be awkward setting the blade on the can and getting it to grip the can, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy. The cord fitting inside the base is a great feature; you can cozy it right up to the outlet if you like, or move it to a convenient place for use. Storage is a breeze without a cord flopping around. I have only been using mine for a month, so I cannot speak to its durability. It looks as though the plastic lever will last if I treat it gently."
4,West Bend Can Opener,"Received this can opener unblemished, and on time as promised by the shipper. This can opener opens cans without leaving a jagged rim on the can (it's left on the can top, which is magnetically suspended when the can is opened fully). It is tall for large cans and looks stylish on my counter (we've nicknamed it ""R2D2). I am completely satisfied with the purchase and would readily recommend it to a friend.The Uncanny One"
5,Great product!!!,This can opener is wonderful. It looks elegant and does a clean job. No more messiness opening a can. It has a knife sharpener. I would recommend this product to anyone..
2,Very disappointing..,"My experience has been about the same as the reviewer ""Robin"". Worked okay for a time but then all kinds of malfunctions started. It got to where I go digging in a drawer for the manual opener rather than mess with it. Finally today I went to Walmart and replaced it. Sure wouldnt' recommend it to anyone."
5,best electric can opener on the market,"At long last, after owning several electric can openers that were developed by the Marquis de Sade, I read about and purchased the West Bend 77205 electric can opener. What a pleasure this is. It is beyond easy to use and functions perfectly with any size can. It does exactly what the manufacturer says it does. Thank you West Bend, you have made a perfect product, and, today, that is RARE!!"
5,Just the best,"Oh my goodness. It must be a crime to love an inanimate object so much. I have been suffering with a poor decision made years ago to purchase an under the cabinet Black & Decker can opener that loved to disperse the contents of the can on the counter. It finally started cutting so poorly that my depression era mentality allowed me to replace it. The West Bend arrived yesterday, right before I was ready to open three cans. It got the acid test with a 28-ounce can of enchilada sauce (okay, some of us have to have help). It didn't spill a drop. It's tall (allow 10 and a half inches) but doesn't take up that much length and width space (5 x 5 inches) on the counter. They also had me with the 70 watt motor and detachable head going in the dishwasher. Nosing around, Amazon had this in their Warehouse Deals section, where the box was supposed to be damaged (but it wasn't), and so the price was only $17.99 (new item with warranty) including super saver shipping (at $25 for total purchases)."
4,Works Great!,Nice looking and cuts like a dream. The very last cut of the can does not jerk it and splash the contents all over the place. The negative side is most of it is plastic. We did not want plastic in our kitchen.
1,DONT BUY,I have had this for a brief time and hardly used it. It died already. Dont waste your money. Spend a little more for a quality one..
5,Sheer Perfection,I am honestly baffled by anyone who would give this any less than 4 stars. I think some folks are just plain stupid.
2,Very large and eye catching,I had a 20 year old electric can opener that just went dead. I bought this one because of the good reviews. It is such a surprise that this one is 30% taller and fatter than my old one. It is an eye-catching piece of appliance. It takes up my counter space. I should have paid attention to the size description.
2,Great looking but stopped working,"Bought this can opener in red and it looked great on the counter. I wish the function had been as good as the design. It often took 2 or 3 tries to get the can in the exact position required by the opener to operate, then it died on us after less than a year. Would not buy West Bend again."
5,Sweet!,"Great can opener - and it looks so nice too! I was so happy with it, I bought my grandmother a red one!"
1,Terrible product!!!,"Worst electric can opener I've ever used! Completely malfunctioned within three days. Weak motor, bad design. Shame on the manufacturer. I had a far better one in my house forty years ago. They can't equal that with today's improvements in technology and design?! Terrible."
2,Why?,"is it that they can send a rocket to Mars but NOBODY can manufacture a lasting electric can opener. I've had two of these West Bends: first one lasted 7 months; last one lasted 10 months. I just ordered another. Why? Because all the other brands I bought didn't even last that long. Somebody, please make a good electric can opener that will last for 20 years like my last one made in America did!"
2,Shredded labels in the food,"I chose this product based on internet claims (not on Amazon) that it is fast. Its speed is normal, like any $10 can opener. I should have heeded the warnings of other reviewers about paper in the food. I have yet to open a can without destroying the label and as often as not, I have to pick out pieces of paper before using the contents.The fold away magnet is nice, but not necessary. Sometimes, the cutter doesn't engage on the first try. I would suggest that you buy something else."
2,worked beautifully for 2 months,"bought it.. loved it. Husband used it and now it will not work correctly. Have taken it apart and it appears that nothing is wrong until, of course, you go to use it and the blade jambs between the metal cog. Pulled the blade out and worked for couple times and not not working again. Not the blade this time. Just stops and has to be reset...takes 10 X to open the can.Crap! thought I bought a good one."
3,decent can opener,"From all the stellar reviews, I ordered this can opener. I found that, with some cans, the opener ""grabbed"" the label and made opening the can a bit more difficult. However, works fine, for the most part. I've tried using the knife sharpener on the back of the can opener; and, haven't found this to be very effective in sharpening my kitchen knives. The silent operation of the knife sharpener makes me wonder if it is really working. Since I didn't buy it for this feature, it's not that important. Would have been a nice added feature, though. Do like it's sleek design."
5,Refreshingly sturdy and durable,"This can opener is tall and sturdy enough to handle any can, even those jumbo size ones you buy at Costco and Sam's Club. It has a nice heft to it too, so it won't accidentally tip over or fall, and it cuts with great ease. Surprisingly, it even cuts perfectly flush with the lip of the can, and if something ever breaks on it, you can always order replacement parts online.Sure you could spend 1/3rd as much on some other electric can opener, but you'll probably regret it. After our old electric can opener of 20+ years broke, we needed a new one. We tried one of those cheap ones from Wal-Mart, but we returned it the next day. Frustrated, I researched can openers online and came across this West Bend model. Frankly, I'm glad I bought it. It's a refreshingly quality product in an age where price seems to be all manufacturers care about."
1,Sorry about this review,"At first, I thought this can opener was going to be just great....then ...after less than 2 weeks or so and that means probably less than 10 cans opened, it completely died. Put the can up to the blade, push down, and....a buzz is all I get. Guess like some other reviewer said, I'll just open the drawer and open the can with an old fashioned manual can opener until I make a trip to Walmart to buy a replacement."
1,Terrible,"I had a can opener for 15 years that just went because the blades were so dull, they could not cut down on the can.I had expected to find something, not as good, but at least workable. This can opener first of all, always ripped the paper off and it got jammed in the wheel. So I always had to remember to remove paper from the cans. Now after a few weeks, I can not get the blade to connect with the can at all. The wheel just spins.I will not buy this manufacturer again. But again it was made in CHINA."
4,Great Product - Poor Support,"This is a great can opener - It is sleek, functional, and nice to look at. It does everything advertised and does it well. It made me quickly realize how cruddy our previous opener was. However....I originally bought this can opener in the chrome version and it arrived defective. Following the STOP warning paper that was included with the opener - I called the 800 number provided. I was very surprised that someone picked up the phone I was greeting with a ""Hello?"". I thought I had the wrong number for a minute. At any rate - I explained my problem she was less than helpful. I was told to ship it to them (at my own cost) and, if it was determined to be defective, they would either fix it or ship me a new one. My mind did some quick calculations and I knew I'd be without my item for anywhere form 2-6 weeks. I just told her I'll deal with Amazon on it because I wouldn't get any hassles from them. And I didn't.So - overview - GREAT opener - poor Customer Service."
3,It's a can opener,"It's a can opener. Nothing fancy or special.The handle is a bit funky/small. But OK once you get used to it. You have to lift up the lid magnet each time that you are going to open a can. Sometimes it rips the paper around the rim of the can.Large cans can be a challenge to hold the can up with one hand and push the handle with the other hand.Looks Great & StylishNothing great, but also nothing too bad."
4,Great Can Opener,"I love the Color of mine, it's red. It is so pretty!!!! It works great but the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is sometimes the magnet doesn't stick to the top of the can. Besides that it's a great product!!!"
2,stopped working after 3 months,"Worked fine with a few quirks then just stopped working completely. No sound no movement, nothing. A high price for something that broke. Also it is quite huge. I will get a smaller can opener next time."
5,Best Electric Can Opener,"I have owned several Electric Can openers in past. This is the Best can opener I have ever owned. Other can openers it would take 4 min. per can to open this takes 10 seconds. It is very fast, easy to use. It was well thought out when they designed it. It works very well. It will last many years of use."
4,Best of form and function,This appliance looks good on the kitchen counter (and it works as good as it looks). It sometimes takes a moment or two to line the can up with the gear and the cutter (which is no different than other types of openers) but this unit works better than anything we've had before. The knife sharpener is a stationary set of small abrasive 'blocks' on the back of the unit and does a solid job of sharpening knives.
5,West Bend 77203 Electric Can Opener,Works great. I bought this for my wife for Christmas and it does what it is supposed to do.
3,Good but has some problems.,"I REALLY LIKE THE LOOK OF THIS CAN OPENER. I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT OPENED CANS THE OLD FASHIONED WAY. IT IS EASY TO CUT YOURSELF. I ALSO DONT LIKE THE FACT THAT THE PAPER FROM THE CAN SOMETIMES GETS JAMMED IN THE BLADE. OTHER THAN THAT, IT IS OK."
4,pretty red accent for my kitchen,"I like it but I find it difficult to fit the edge of the can in exactly the right place for the blade to begin the opening process. However, it is easier to use than that old hand crank one that I had before this one."
4,Efficient and Reliable Can Opener,"This is a very reliable and easy-to-use can opener at a reasonable price. It hugs cans nicely with a strong grip and makes slick work of the cutting. Down sides are that it is lightweight and doesn't feel very anchored on the counter, and my husband doesn't care for the shape of the press-down lever. If you are used to pressing down with your hand on a lever with a flat surface, it may seem a little uncomfortable. However, if you pinch it between your thumb and pointer finger and pull down, it is a perfect fit. In fact, it seems ergonomically designed to fit this way. All in all, I am very happy with it."
5,"Bought this for my Mom, she loves it","My Mom was wanting a red can opener, I looked around for her and decided on this one. She loves it."
5,Love It!,"My old can opener kept falling apart so I decided it was time to invest in a new one. I've always purchased cheap ones, thinking one can opener was pretty much like another, but this time I thought I'd spring for something with a little more quality. After reading a lot of Amazon's customer reviews, I opted for this one.I'm not disappointed! I like the snazzy look of it, the height that allows for large cans, and the ease of using it. It is nicely weighted to prevent larger, heavier cans from tipping it over. It runs quietly and smoothly, stopping automatically when the can is open. The built in cord storage is a very nice touch that eliminates one of my pet peeves. I haven't used the knife sharpener or bottle opener, but I think those are both nice features, as well.I definitely recommend this product!"
4,great can opener,"Finally a can opener that does what it is supposed to do. The last 4 can openers I bought did not operate properly. The last one a Black and Decker was a joke. I love this can opener, it opens cans the first time, every time. Great!! I would give it a 4.5 and would recommend the 7703 to anyone who is tired of constantly fooling with the can to get it to cut or lock on the opener."
2,Amazon and or FedEx Service,"It is difficult to get the can opener to accept a can and the can doesn't turn so it can be opened...I might as well bought a manual can opener but did not since I have severe arthritis in my hands. I will try, very hard, NOT to buy from Amazon again your service is slow you did not respond to my e-mail timely unless this is it and delivery by FedEx is the worst. Your messages and theirs are different and there is no way the driver could not have delivered the package since the address was to a small retail store (friends of mine) in Valley WA and it is open all day long every day of the week. The driver said no one was there. Sorry but you have lost me as a customer."
1,Zero Openings,This is the very worst. I could not get it to open even ONE can. I don't know if it was defective or just rotten. I have sent it back and don't want a replacement. I went by the wonderful reviews on this site and was I sorry. A can opener should at least open a can. To tell you the truth I would give it zero stars if it was possible.
2,Imcompatible.,"I have not used it as yet because i have not got a ""power reducer"" to run it, i did find one online, but it was huge.Someone will be having it as a xmas present."
1,This one goes to Goodwill,I tried and tried and never was able to get it to work.I bought a different brand.
1,MADE IN CHINA !!!!!!!!,"That is exactly what is wrong with this country. No wonder the unemployment is so high, and many Americans can hardly afford to put gas in their cars or food in their kids mouths. I researched this product on the West Bend website and it made me believe I was buying an American made product. West Bend WI.? since when was Wisconsin located in China? The residents of West Bend must be proud. I could have saved money and purchased at Walmart if I wanted to support China's economy.I will not purchase another West Bend product."
5,One smooth can opener!,"I bought this can opener five months ago, and so far, I couldn't be more pleased. It works beautifully. It grips the can firmly and does its thing, with the magnet holding onto the top so I never have to fish through the can contents to pull it out. It handles many different sizes of cans without a hitch. It also is very sleek - takes up just a little bit of countertop space and looks great. Very satisfied with this purchase."
5,Wonderful appliance that I will have for many years,"I bought this on the advice of another reviewer who stated how well this worked, how easy it was to hook the can to the appliance and then remove the top after the can had effortessly and quietly cut it away. It does all that without a fuss. I am so glad not to have to manhandle some poorly-made appliance every time I need to open a can to make a meal. I would definitely buy this again and I plan to do so if the one I have ever wears out say, 10 or 15 years from now. It is very well made. A solid machine."
5,Excellent Can Opener,"I bought this for my mom since her arthritis is so bad. It works extremely well - just place the can against the side and press down the lever. Couldn't be easier. Makes for a clean cut lid that can be placed back on the can if need be. Haven't tried the sharpener or bottle opener but didn't really need that anyway.The quality of this device seems to be pretty good; feels sturdy and well-built. For the price, I can't imagine getting anything better when you're looking for an electric can opener."
4,get's the job done,"Good product, opens cans well, sometimes a bit troublesome getting can on properly to start turning, but happy with product."
4,Better than any other electric can opener,"I gave this 4 stars. It is well built, sturdy and easy to clean. The only reason it got 4 stars rather than 5 is that the lid edges are sharp and dangerous, which is inherent to this type of opener, I would suppose. If only they could figure out how to roll the edges of the lid like some safety hand held openers. I really got this for my 94 year young father so he could open cans when I am not home. It works well. It is easy to get cans started on this opener and It has a strong motor. I would buy this product again. It does everything it is supposed to do."
4,Very good!,"This is the best can opener I have ever owned. It works easily and cleans nicely. I would give it 5 stars, but I haven't had it long enough to know how long it will last. I can say that it is very sturdy and I really like the style."
1,Broken Gear,My 77205 Can Opener is less than one year old and the Gear wheel broke off...DON'T BUY this piece of junk!
5,West Bend Opener in West Bend,"West Bend 77205 Electric Can Opener, WhiteOpener is extremely easy to use for my wife and I. Knife sharpener works very well. Can opener does any size can easily and leave no sharp edges. Not only looks good but works good. Actually does meet expectations and cleans easily in our dishwasher. Excellent value for the price. Since we live in West Bend, WI where West Bend brand started it's even more fun. Would recommend to anyone."
2,Lasted 1 and 1/2 years,"We used this approx twice a day for one and a half years, worked great, until it died, with no warning. You get what you pay for! Looks great, loved it, WON'T buy it again."
2,Disappointing...,"After reading rave reviews about this (how can anyone get this excited about a can opener?) I bought it. After a year and a half, the blade is dull, it rips the paper off the outside of the can which wads up and lands on the cupboard, and the lid inevitably falls into the can most of the time, so I always have to dust off the lid before opening so dust doesn't fall inside the can. This type of can opener (top-cutting) leaves very sharp edges and the lid cannot be replaced on the can without falling in nor can it open pull-top lids. I won't ever buy this kind again. I had a side-cutting can opener before this (creating a smooth, non-sharp, replaceable lid), which isn't made anymore. I just purchased a hand-held smooth-edge can opener (Fissler) and will put this one in the garbage dump where it belongs."
1,Shreds can labels & paper gets in your food,"It shreds the top of can labels and the shards rain down into our soups, vegetables, etc. when we poured them out. We started tearing the labels off before opening the cans to avoid this problem. Finally, we realized it's easier and quicker to open the can with the old fashioned manually hand-cranked opener than to keep tearing off labels each time. So we retired this to the dreaded cabinet above the refrigerator."
2,Not the Review I Wanted to Write,"I followed all the swell recommendations for this can opener. I received it sometime in December and used it as necessary, which means not every day. Well, today, April 27, as I was sharpening some paring knives, the can opener died. Burnt to a crisp. I am very disappointed, and I would recommend great care when using the knife-sharpening feature. Of course the limited 1-year warranty is so limited that I am not about to fool around wasting time with returns, repairs, especially at my own expense. The can opener is going straight to the trash can. I am so very disappointed with this product. If you plan to sharpen knives with it, (and I am not even sure WHY a bottle opener feature is necessary), use care. Better yet, find something better, perhaps made in the USA, as this piece of junk was made in China. What was I thinking?Best,penlady (a.k.a Melinda J. Adams)"
2,minimal knife sharpener,"What amazes me about all of these 5 star reviews is that there is little warning that what is touted as a knife sharpener is truly minimal. If you are looking for a robust knife sharpener that works electrically with something like carborundam wheels and can handle serrated blades; this is not for you. You may have guessed this by the price. If you are looking for only a can opener, then all 5 star reviews have meaning."
2,Outer mostly plastic,"This can opener has a nice appearance, but it's not real chrome/metal on the outside, it's mostly plastic. I don't know why they say it's chrome/metal when the majority of it is plastic!"
1,JUNK!,I received this opener and it is made of cheap plastic and It already fell apart! I am calling the company on Monday. Don't waste your money!!!
1,Disappointed,"I bought this can opener based on so many favorable reviews, but would not purchase it again. In nineteen months after purchase, it simply stopped working. The company offers no repair services for the item. We didn't use it very often, and it was not easy to engage the opener, taking several tries to get the can engaged with the cutter."
5,Finally! A Great Can Opener,"After having gone through 3 electric can openers, I decided to spend a little more and see if the adage ""you get what you pay for"" holds true. At last, I have a can opener that works every time, holds heavy cans, is not noisy and is easy to use. This is a great product, well worth the money. I had seen lots of reviews on this product and one of the web sites voted it the best electric can opener. As an added bonus it is also nice looking. Don't hesitate to purchase this one."
4,It works but...cheap quality,"When you figure out how to use it, its ah-mazing! My hands were killing me from using crappy can openers. But the problem I have is that its quality is cheap. For the price I would expect a little more heavy duty. Should have came with multiple razors that can be replaced since over time I'm sure it will get dull. Unless you make sure to always whip up the razor after using it. The knife sharper and bottle opener in the back was a nice treat. But again its cheap quality. Every time we use the bottle opener...because of the way it is angled beer splashes all over the back. Overall we are satisfied with it! But not worth the price."
5,The best I have owned,I have used mine for over a year now. I love it. Easy to use. Great for arthritic hands. A must have for me.
1,Just stopped.,I have had this can opener for about 2 months and after about 10 or so uses it just wont work anymore. The motor is fried. I used it the night before just fine then today bam it wont even turn on. Sad this Can Opener looked amazing to bad the build of the internals aren't just as amazing.
3,"Okay, but...",I liked it but was under the impression it would open #10 cans but it did not have the power to do so.
5,Looks good and works good,Replaced our worn out black and decker. It fits nice on our counter and works as described. Also has a knife sharpener that we were not aware of when we purchased.
5,Sleek and Attractive,Best can opener I have ever owned! Fast and easy to operate. Great to look at and matches my new stainless appliances. Worth the extra money.
5,Great can opener,"This was bought almost a year and a half ago, and has been used a few times each week, sometimes more. I've used it on little cans (like tomato paste) and bigger ones (like huge cans of tomatoes), and I have never had a problem with it. It is tall and sturdy and has never tipped over on me (of course it was held with a 5 lb can). Easy to use, works quickly and is just a good, reliable product so far."
3,good for large cans,"It works great on standard & larger cans, but doe NOT WORK on smaller cans, like tomato paste or canned mushrooms....I'm a little dissapointed, overall"
5,West Bend Electric Can Opener,"This can opener is easy to use, quiet, and has an attractive design. I had a hard time locating a white opener with chrome trim that wasn't a $9.99 special. This West Bend has the style and quality I was looking for."
2,Not as happy as I thought I would be,"It works great on the smaller can, but it does not have enough juice for the bigger family size cans."
4,My Opener,"Love the smooth operation & color. Only drawback is the handle on the cutting accessory which is a little sharp. The picture shows a black cover on it but there was none . Works so much better, quieter, and smoother than any I've had before"
2,Great while it lasted,"I also loved this can opener! Like the others have stated, it was very easy to attach a can to it, and you flip the handle down and it goes and goes. Mine fit the can so closely, it always ended up ripping the lable off the can. And after about a year of use, the handle no longer stays ""down,"" and therefore won't open cans unless I stand there holding the handle down till the can is open. Technically it still ""works"" but not as intended. Luckily it was inexpensive, so I don't feel too bad about replacing it."
4,Good opener for the price,"I tend to agree with most the reviews. The opener is smooth, quiet and opens cans effortlessly. It does what is advertises. The bottle opener and the manual knife sharpener are on the back of the unit, so you would have to turn it everytime you want to open a bottle which is a bit inconvenient. Most people would probably opt to use other tools for that anyway. The opener has a removable head unit for cleaning which is an excellent feature.I did not give it 5 stars because of the finish. I got mine in black and the finish does NOT have a nice luster to it which makes the opener look a bit on the cheap side. If the metallic version fits in your kitchen color scheme, then I would recommend that finish over the black for sure."
2,lasted 6 months,"I bought this can opener in December 2009 and I need to replace it. The lever has become almost impossible to lift in order to fit the can on the opener. I'm not sure what the issue is--I think the blade is rubbing up against the back of the attachment. When I do manage to get the can in place, it takes a lot of pushing to get the blade to set. While the can opener is running, it's ripping the paper on the can."
2,Quit working too soon,"This can opener just quit after several years. The last electric can opener I had worked for over 15 years! This one got the blade in the food and ripped the paper off the cans, too. And is very large for the counter. I could have gotten a better can opener at the Goodwill Store."
4,West Bend Electric Can Opener,"The West Bend Electric Can Opener was a replacement for my stylish Cuisinart Can Opener. I would Absolutely recommend it because it is sturdy and very easy to use. No more label peeling off as the opener moves around the can. I can open large cans of tomatoes for sauce and the opener doesn't tilt over. Also, it's very quiet compared to other openers. I was at my brother's home the other day and used their opener and was surprised how cheap and loud their product was. Overall, I'm very happy with the product and would recommend it."
3,Functional and good looking,This can opener works well once you get the alignment right. It is very nice looking on the counter. I'm not quite as excited about it as some other reviewers because it is made of plastic and is not as well made as others I have used in the past. BUT--the price is good and you get what you pay for so I would recommend it to others.
4,Mom loves it!,"Purchased this item as a christmas gift for my mother and she loves it. She said it works well and coordinates well with the orher ""red"" appliances."
1,Great for 12 months...,I was really enthused when the opener arrived and it worked great! Then after about one year it started to have trouble gripping the cans and would run but not open the cans requiring several attempts. Now it won't work at all and I'm out searching for some other design. This thing was a real bummer and was NOT built to last!
3,So So,"I bought this can opener 2+ years ago. It worked, but was not perfect. It shreds the paper on the cans and the lid doesn't usually stay on magnet so it's somewhat messy. I tried washing the head (magnet and blade) frequently thinking maybe food splatters were causing my problems, but that never helped. In other words, I wasn't in love with it, but it worked okay. Today, it stopped working completely. I know it lasted a bit over two years, but I expected better since I don't used it excessively. I'd like a new opener, but am very hesitant about trying this one again."
4,"Older edition, but great beginners manual of tying","This is a great book with great illustrations and basic explainations of the different types of flys. Specific instructions on one of each type, then good pictures of many more of that type fly."
4,SOUTHRN RAP WITH A WEST COAST GANGSTA TWIST,"THIS ALBUM IS GOOD, MAC CAN DO THE RECORD ALL BY HIM SELF WITH NO GUEST AND THIS ALBUM WOULD STILL BE THE SH$T. A LOT OF NO LIMIT RAPPERS NEED HELP TO CARRY THERE ALBUMS, MASTER P KNOWES THAT. THAT'S WHY EVERY NO LIMIT ARTIST HAS LIKE 6 TO 8 GUEST RAPPERS ON THERE ALBUMS. ON THIS ALBUM MAC IS GANGSTER KIND OF 2 PAC-ISH LIKE. HIS OTHER ALBUM ""SHELL SHOCKED"" IS A BIT BETTER, BUT BOTH KICK ASS. A REAL NO LIMIT CLASSIC. MAC STANDS ABOVE THE REST, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FIEND AND SOULJA SLIM R.I.P. PICK THIS ONE UP"
4,Great CD!,"World War III is an awesome cd from MAC, one of the tightest No Limit Soldiers! The best songs are Best Friends, Like Before, Bloody, You Never Know, Battle Cry, If It's Cool, Cops & Robbers, Paradise, Genocide, and Assassin Nation! If you're a TRU No Limit Soldier, you would buy this album if you haven't already!"
4,Conspire this..........,"Fun book.......MF spins a good conspiracy web. It's a humorous twist on an already strange world. I know from personal experience that field biology research, especially for a researcher without the right connections, can be nightmarish. Long hours, primitive conditions and less than primitive pay makes people act strangely. Throw in loneliness, bureaucracy and the Endangered Species Act...? What's a post-doc to do? This is a fun & informed first novel."
5,More than just a teapot book,"I am thrilled with this book, it is more than just a teapot book, it explains so many of the problems that we have as potters, making a teapot that pours nicely, that the lid fits well and doesnt fall off during the pouring, that the spout doesnt twist crooked in the firing and just so much more, styles, ideas and a few glaze recipes as well, very well put together and I will find this book a must to buy for the serious potter"
3,TRoyat's Peter the Great,Actually this is a well-researched book. I was disappointed because I read his Catherine the Great first and found its tone far more professional. Now that was a great book!
2,synthsyren,"Peter the Great, by Henri Troyat, is the excellent recreation of a crucial era in Russian history. Troyat paints a picture of Peter and his life. Peter overcame the odds as a young czar battling for his power with his half-brother Ivan, and half-sister Sophia. Peter became sole czar when he was in his twenties and started living out all of his ambitions. He built the first Russian navy, and also built St. Petersburg, which he began from nothing. His love for war and the sea led him to fight against Sweden for a large part of his life and eventually win a long coastline on the Baltic Sea. For his contributions to Russia, his labors, and his greatness in politics and battle, Peter the Great, ""emperor of the Russians,"" is still considered a hero, even today."
2,absorbing but very depressing,It's a very absorbing movie yet very depressing. It's very artfully done. It's kind of sick. Some of the punch lines are too much - e.g. the rich guy joking about blood of woman's period and virginity (both cases was too crude and unnecessary). I would not recommend this movie unless you're into some major depression.
1,ugh!,"Is there sucha thing as NO STARS? I was told I could program my Ipod on my Windows ME Gateway computer using this disc...packaging on disc box and case says same...It has turned out to be a bust...no can do...money down the drain. Anyone want to buy it and try it? ...It was a waste of money to me. No instructions, no phone support to get help WHILE trying to utelize it ..BUST. MY Ipod still isn't programmed..,.another waste of money as it turns out..to date..purchased week before Christmas..."
3,Probably not worth the money,I was under the impression that this program would allow you to sync seamlessly with itunes. I did not know at the time of purchase that you had to go through the xplay interface. It does allow you to download all of your songs to the computer from the ipod but there is freeware that allows you to do the same thing. It did save me from losing all my songs but I lost all my ratings. That information does not transfer.
1,"Poor documentation, arrogant customer support","I have been buying software for computers for almost 20 years now, and this is one of the worst experiences I've ever had with a software purchase. Despite the fancy ""iPod family"" packaging, there is no manual in the box. The support info on the CD is skeletal, as is the website. Upon calling Media4 customer support, the individual I talked with knew next to nothing about the XP operating system - even though the program is marketed to both Windows and Mac users. There is better freeware out there that actually does what, as far as I can tell, Xplay only says it does."
3,"Useful, But a Bit Dated","A new edition is much needed, revised to make lodging and road information current. Nice photos, but not that useful as a travel guide."
4,One of the best bands ever,These guys are the best...having had the pleasure to see them in concert rocked and the funk and energy is incredible...they love the crowds.
2,bland,Most of the stories in Scarborough Fair are bland and unexciting. The author somehow manages to make even her original ideas feel cliched.
5,Slack Key Jazz CD,"I LOVE THIS CD! Once again Jeff Peterson has melted hearts with his slack key guitar music, and this time with a JAZZ twist. Every one of Jeff Petersons CD's are a treasure and uniquely created in a style only Jeff Peterson can deliver. I own the entire Jeff Petersons music collection and can't wait to hear what he has for us next. Buy this CD, you wont be disappointed.Torie Brown"
2,Only Lasted a Year,"I bought this item a little over a year ago. It worked fine but even from the beginning did not provide the same battery life that my original battery provided- I'd say about 80% or so. That was fine with me since the battery is much cheaper than the OEM version, but what isn't fine is that the battery stopped holding a charge after a little less than a year of use. Just keep that in mind when buying these cheaper alternatives, because I don't doubt that this is a common problem."
2,ok for fun; too much chromatic aberration,"I bought this to use with my Canon 55-250mm IS lens. I was interested in macro photography for fun, but not enough to blow 300-700$ on a 1:1 macro lens. using the opteka I can manage to get 1:1 or larger, but with pretty heavy chromatic aberration. There is decent sharpness if you can work with the ultra thin DOF. Hand holding is out of question for the +4 and +10 macro filters. I was able to minimized CAs in Lightroom to some extent. This is ok if you just want to play with macro photography on a shoestring budget.If you can up your budget by about 200$, the Sigma 50mm 1:1 macro will probably be a much better buy."
5,A good sequel to The Probability Broach,"While it may not be quite as good as the original book, the author is able, with the main characters already firmly established, to have a lot more fun with the story line right off the bat. The story is a mixed bag, part sci-fi, part adventure, part socialcommentary, with a good dash of humor thrown in, it makes for a pretty good read.To keep it short, if you liked the Probability Broach, you will like this book. If you didn`t, you probably will not care for it.An excellent alternate history story."
3,Jumping Sharks in the Asteroid Belt -- and Beyond!,"The second in the ""Win Bear"" detective / alternate history / political lecture series -- and right about where they jumped the shark. Lots of gadgetry and bizarre settings. Plenty of outlandish characters -- human and otherwise. Entirely too much eye-rolling Libertarian college sophomore bull session philosophizing.What should not be missed is the most viciously funny caricature of pompous ol' Walter Cronkite in all of literature. (Easy to spot if you know what the German homonym of his last name means. And think ""Jimmy Carter."")"
3,Not the best of Al Bano,"I'm a big fan of Al Bano, but this CD misses the mark for me. Maybe it is the CD itself, as the sound quality is not the best. Of course, Nel Sole is always magnificent, but none of the other songs on this CD stand out for me. There is just something missing.....oh yes, I know what it is.....Romina is missing!!"
3,Deatails,"This book, have not details about gas sensors, its important especific details, and it is focus only about one material, its important other materials, in ispite of about one material it is not very clear."
1,Sorry Product,"I got two DVD's from Comedy Central, one would not paly at all on any of my DVD players and the other displayed the comics but was very poor picture quality. I will not buy any more products from Comedy Central. I did not return these Items, I do not have the time or the patients, so I will take my loss."
2,quality not great,"the quality is not great on this flag, but then again, none of the descriptions promised much. you can't ask for much for the price, so I guess you get what you pay for."
3,"Not as pictured, but still a good product.",I bought this for my Father in law for his birthday thinking it would be like pictured with black lettering. When it arrived it was all black with the eagle in white in the center. He loved it so we didnt send it back but I thought I was getting what was pictured.
3,Is that really the end?,"I guess once the author got to 400 hundred pages she felt rushed to finish the book. It ended like a typical mystery/romance would, but with not build up of a relationship.This book had some great parts, but ended badly."
4,Fun Summer Read,"I really enjoyed this book, it was entertaining and, in places, charming. It is the perfect summer book. The characters are enjoyable, the setting is lovely, and the shopping trips sounds like loads of fun."
3,My least favorite book by Mary Kay Andrews,"I agree with other reviewers who thought that this book was poorly edited. While I understand she's an interior designer, the endless antique shopping scenes bored me to tears.I also don't think the relationship between Keely and Will was developed enough because of the numerous subplots."
2,Ummm not what I was expecting,"I thought this would be a funny and fun to read book, but it was neither. The beginning was funny, but that is all. It obsesses over the antique furniture and I found the end to be abrupt. I would not recommend."
4,"Predictable, but funny !","Hissy Fit is a quick read that has a predictable plot. However, it is funny; prompting some good, real, chuckles out loud. I read it to take a break from some heavy reading material. I've ordered a paperback of hers to read as I liked her style. Lighthearted, it keeps your interest."
2,Ho-Hum,"This book could barely hold my attention; only because of my obsession with beginning what I start did I finish it. It seemed to not know what it wanted to be - a woman recovering from an upset in her personal life and living an independent life, a mystery about her mother, or her is she/isn't she attraction to her client. The author should have stuck to one issue, not all three. Took too many turns and I would not recommend it."
3,Good beach read,"Easy, breezy,fun read. Biased review based on my personal geography. One that isn't too difficult to pick back up between cool summer cocktails."
3,Light and fluffy,"This was my book club's July selection, chosen because it's a ""light read."" It's light, alright. Light and fluffy. The discussion meeting was tonight and I missed it because I had to work late. Which means that I read this book for nuthin'. *sigh*The plot was interesting enough, but the writing was bad. So bad that I sneered and complained aloud and almost said ""forget it"" in the first chapter. Then I ran out of other stuff to read on a rainy Sunday and I settled in on the couch with it. It got better, but I wouldn't have picked it back up if I didn't ""have to."""
4,Good Chick Lit,"This was a great book, the plot was a little far-fetched, but I couldn't help laughing anyway. It would probably make a funny movie."
3,Satire for Fun,"Mary Kay Andrews (Kathy Trocheck) places her computer keyboard deep in her cheek and delivers the southern nightmare wedding in HISSY FIT. Revenge is sweet declares the bride and the reader gets to enjoy the fun of this engaging chick lit author.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
3,An Engaging Read,"I bought this book soely based upon the Title. Being from the South I am weel familiar with the phrase ""Hissy Fit"". I was not disappointed that I bought this book. It is a delightful look at Southern life and Southern women especially. The only thing that I did find a little implausible was the hero's idea of decorating a mansion to woo a woman that he did not really know. The hero did seem rather flaky to me. Hence I could not give this book 5 stars."
5,Loved Every Page!!,"Not only did I not want to put this one down, I didn't want it to end either! I loved these characters and the story has the right amount of mystery and humor. Once again, Mary kay Andrews has delivered a wonderful book. I recommend all of her books, but beware: you'll find yourself giggling out loud and people will look at you funny - it happened to me!"
3,An Easy Read,"Did you ever read a book and at the end you're not quite sure if you liked it or not? That's how I feel about Hissy Fit. I liked most of the characters well enough, but I was a little disappointed with the ending. I think the character of Will Mahoney was not fleshed out enough - I couldn't quite grasp on to his attraction. He just wasn't there enough for me to like him. Which didn't keep me from reading the book straight through in one sitting. But the main female character, Keeley, was very strong - not a wimpering, simpering violet at all, but a woman who deals with life head on. I definitely enjoyed that aspect. And the story was good as well. I look forward to reading her other books."
4,Great story,"I liked this book. Granted, all of Mary Kay Andrews' books are fluffy, so you have to know that going in. It's no World and Peace. But it was a lighthearted story with likeable characters and a storyline that kept me interested. I actually think this is my favorite of all the Mary Kay Andrews books I've read. Some of her stories can be a bit farfetched, but this one was down to earth and quite enjoyable. I thought it was miles better than Deep Dish or some of her later books."
3,Audio not as good as story,"I am listening to the book on tape right now and I am truely enjoying the story. However, Ms Driscoll's accent is NOT a southern classic. As a Georgia girl I have a few qualms, unfortunately I cannot elaborate because you would have to ""hear"" the problems yourself. Lets just say that it pronounced ""we-dow-we"" Alabama, not ""wed-o-we"" Alabama. And Chaise Lounge is NOT ""Chez long"". In my opinion read the book and skip the audio."
4,A fun read,"Like ""Little Bitty Lies"" this is a great book for a vaction on the beach. The characters are exaggerated but likeable and the plot is reminiscent of one of those guilty pleasures made for tv Lifetime movies about a woman scorned by her cheating fiance. This is a light and fast read that will amuse and entertain you."
4,Almost predictable,It was a cute story. Pretty predictable until the wedding at the end. That was so sweet. But still a very good read.
2,2.5 stars,"Not her best. It was hard to get through this slow, plodding story. The plot was thin, the mystery transparent."
2,bad editing,"Read all the reviews, thought this would be a nice lite book to read for fun ... talk about droning on and on and on. Half-way through so far, and it is obvious that the proofreaders and editor should have actually read this before going to print. Sadly disappointing ... especially since I ordered another book from the same author."
3,It's ok.,It's ok. It's not great. It's actually a little depressing in places. And I wish there wasn't so much bad language. This is the first of her books that I read and I haven't bought another one. I may try her books again with hopes of better success.
3,Others can tell you about the story. Let me tell you what I liked about this,"Mary Kay Andrews is a southern writer who is a friend of the 3 women who pen the Caroline Cousins books. I read this on their (well, one of their) recommendation. Not my usual style but a cutsey read. Actually kind of interesting to learn about the foundation business in a roundabout way."
4,Hissy Fit,"Southern Humor at it's best. Good characters and good fun. Lots of Southernisms and antiquing in Atlanta, Savannah, Mobile and New Orleans. What could be better..."
4,I'd read it again!,"Oh what a great read! Funny, fast paced and loveable characters. I'm not big on interior design so some of the details were a little much for me but other than that I highly recommend Hissy Fit!"
2,Dubbed,I am very irritated that Amazon does not list anywhere that this movie is dubbed. I'm also irritated that it's dubbed in the first place. Thank you to everyone who wrote a review mentioning that this film is dubbed since Amazon neglected to provide this information at all. I would buy this movie if they offered a subtitled version.
5,You don't get better then this!,A must for all who care about what happened to the Jews or gypsies in Germany and throughout Europe from the 1930's until the end of the war.This film is both moving and entertaining. It should be shown in all high schools around the country and throughout the world. A film for all serious movie buffs.
3,A slow awakening,"This is a chilling movie, but also slow paced. Tom Courtenay, in the role of a famous mime, is forced to stage a childrens play for the Gestapo to show the Red Cross that all is well in the 'Jew Town'. He slowly comes to the understanding of what is happening to the Jews, and he makes the play more and more elaborate, with a larger and larger cast. Unlike in Schindler's List, where the list meant life, his list only provides transient protection.The movie is dubbed, and some of the singing voices appear to be all from one person. But then again, this is not a high budget film. Other than scene selection, there are no bells and whistles on the DVD."
4,Holocaust drama about a false performance at a con. camp.,"Not a movie for the faint of heart; focuses on one of the ""better"" concentration camps. The American Red Cross is coming to the camp to inspect it, and the officials want to make sure the camp remains in operation. They bribe a renowned mime to put on a performance, involving the children of the camp, so that everyone seems happy and well-adjusted to their prison. Heartbreaking--especially the last scene."
4,It is a right book for a coach of a company.,"This book help you to evaluate and motivate your staff members. Give you the guidelines for planing your strategy in the lidership development of your team, and it provide you with questionaries, diagrams and other helpful tools for your daily work."
4,Great but may need to apply more than usual,"I love Truefitt & Hill and think they are one of the very best luxury shaving cream and balm makers on the market. However, this aftershave balm is not the best I've tried. Although I still use it daily, it's not as thick and moisturizing as The Art of Shaving Lavender. This does tingle a bit when you put it on your freshly shaved face. That may be due to the antiseptic properties of the lavender contained within the product. I just find myself applying more than I normally would apply other balms.I still would recommend this for sensitive skin, as it seems to be very gentle and non-irritating. Since it's so light, this would be a great summer aftershave balm. Use more in the winter and let it soak into the skin after shaving like I do."
3,Just okay,"This stuff is pricey, and I needed to use more of it than I expected. A little dab goes a long way, but it takes more than just a little dab. Even mixing it with a drop or two of water didn't help much. Instead, try the Taylor of Old Bond Street balm, with just a few drops of water on your finger tips. Feels great, and doesn't take much!"
5,Unprecedented,"My dad wanted to get rid of this a while back so I took it under my ""wing."" (How he acquired it in the first place: unknown.)Anyway, this is a cheezy album, there's no doubt about it. BUT, some of the songs are actually pretty catchy and I find myself humming along on occasion. Good CD to play for friends to incite some laughs. Definitely one of a kind!"
1,Written for the mechanic that fixes everything with a hammer,"The writers assumed that the reader wouldn't be able to handle anything more difficult then an oil-change or brake-shoe adjustment. Doesn't include meaningful schematics and recommends that you take your car to the shop if having air-conditioning problems. When confronted with taking out the car stereo from the dash it recommends that you buy the ""special tool"" needed to do the job (you need a metric allen wrench, but you won't find that out by reading this book)."
2,Not very helpful.,"Haynes repair manuals used to be essential to any car enthusiast. Back when cars were simpler, such as when MG's and Triumph's were still being made, you could count on a Haynes manual to give you step by step instructions on most any repair you needed to make. Now, cars are much more complicated, yet Haynes still tries to keep their manuals the same size. A one inch thick manual for an MGB is rather comprehensive. A one inch thick manual for a BMW is too vague to be useful. And in this case, they are trying to combine two very different models (the 3 series and the 5 series) into that one inch space. Many of the instructions given are simply generic advice that aren't the slightest bit specific to BMW.I can't see much value in Haynes manuals anymore. Bentley manuals are much more expensive but it's money well spent. At least you'll get advice beyond, ""to install new part, perform the reverse operation""."
5,A Must Read,Profoundly stimulating ... in fact it is wisdom enhancing. They present a compelling vision of the role of the leader: to be the architect of organizational systems and values to create an intelectual democracy where evidence-based decision making is what is worshiped ... not the rockstar CEO.
1,The negative side of everything.,"I devour business books, I have read over 50 this year. This book made me so angry that I'm taking the time to write the first review.The book is well written and have a lot of facts, but it is WORTHLESS.The name of the book should have been ""The negative side of everything"".We all know that in every strength there is a weakness and in every weakness there is opportunity.In fact the well respected professor of Stanford wrote in one sentence the entire book, he said ""No drug is without side effect"".This books criticize every business practice and give no advice in how to improve it, do better or any kind of suggestion whatsoever.We all know that there is no perfect business practice, and nothing in life is perfect. You don't need to read a book for that.What a WASTE of time !!!"
1,"Lousy ""Facts""","Wow, the author criticized by book without calling me and without noting that CEOs (including Jack Welch) of every case study personally signed off on all the claims of improvements in hiring."
1,Item not correct,"The listing title said Volume 1. I received Volume 6, which my son already has. I e-mailed the company for clarification and got no answer. My five year old really wanted the songs from volume 1, so he is very sad."
4,"Quick, Inspirational Read","The author's simple prose style and deep faith come across in this quick, inspirational book of poems. I found the work easy to read and well organized by topics ranging from inspirational (Christian), nature, love/romance and friendship.Anne S.Atlanta, Georgia"
3,A Meandering Ride,"The novel is clever rather than illuminating. For all its experimentation with structure, points of view, and language, it fails to engage. The story is meandering without leading anywhere meaningful. Its characters are found wanting in complexity and depth. In fact, the multiple narrators speak with the same voice, namely, the author's. There is a murder mystery, but it fails to excite. There is a love story, but it ignites no flame. The book poses as a psychologically complex novel rather than being one. And at four hundred odd pages, it's far too long."
2,"Great depth of style, uninteresting story","The short story:- Orhan Pamuk's writing style is outstanding.- His method of relating the story/plot and characters as alternating perspectives on events is refreshing.- Outside of those interested in historical Persia, the story line itself is rather boring and once my interest is Pamuk's prose itself wore off, I lost interest in what was happening."
2,The joy is in the destination,"very uneven mix of dialogue/plot and history/theology...the joy here is not in the journey, but in the destination...The End."
1,Orhan Pamuk?,"Orhan Pamuk is a simply an orientalist culture man. He is not even an intellectual, and his books are only good marketing purposes. In one of his interview he says 'Ottoman empire is like a rude man trying to entice the elegant lady, Europe'. He has this mediocre orientalist level of thinking ability. The Nobel Prize Laureate in Literature, Octavio Paz, says ""If your book is a best seller, you have to worry about the level of your its intellectual level"". My advice is do not buy this book, it's total waste of time and money, but if you really want to read some market book go and read harry potter or something :)"
4,Intriguing story,"Not my usual genre, but am enjoying the dialogue and history lesson. Would definitely recommend it to others who like a good mystery."
5,Excellent book,"I read this book while exploring Istanbul. What a joy! Great story, great writing. Loved it."
4,A new era.,"Though it is not comparable to 'Black Book', in 'My Name is Red', I think, Pamuk has done a great job and opened an era for Turkish readers who usually accustom to so-called 'westernized' modern Turkish literature, as he showed that they have inherited a great history and it did not started in 1923."
3,Reading Pamuk,"I find most of Pamuk's books full of men after noble pursuits and two dimentional female characters whose destines always point to a man. His world is as masculine as its gets, no space for strong independent females. But what is most fraustrating is the way in which Pamuk seems to compete with his reader: as soon as you get a sense of what is going on, he interupt the flow. So often he does this, appereantly not wanting the reader to guess what is next, that as reader I find myself thinking 'whatever'.My Name is Red is a little better than his other books in these regards but, still seems to repeat more of the same with the exception of some interesting historical artistic practices in Ottoman Istanbul."
3,My Name is Red,"The narrative in this book shifts from person to person to objects and back again. It is not easy at first to follow all the shifts. The focus on Art is very interesting, as well there are some glimpses of life in the time of the Ottomans. The murderer is very easy to spot, but that makes sense in a story about the importance of perception and vision."
2,Tedious,"I listened to the audio CD whilst driving,and I almost killed myself falling asleep.The prose is lusious even in transalation.The setting exotic and imperial in Istanbul/Constantiople.The historical context tintalating and absorbing.The plot is about 2 murdered classical islamic painters in a community of artist in the service of the sultan.All this is anchored by the romance of a mediocre clerk/Black and a beautiful but faithless widow/Shekura.The interesting aspect of the novel is the tool of narration in the first person.Everyone gets an opportunity,including the murderer,the dog and the horse.Unfortunately it reminds me of exquisite recording of a pedestrain symphony-boring.On top of that,it is so long winded-words,words,words.It was only my sheer stuborness and my survival on the road that enabled me to finish."
2,over rated,"I have now read several nobel winners and they frequently leave me asking - how did this win an award. The book starts off well enough but the story becomes fragmented and confused, almost as if some chapters were edited out and the story wasn't adjusted to compensate for their removal. Also it was much more of a love story than a murder mystery; more like a romance novel with a murder for a back drop."
1,Wonderful/Magnificant/sumptuous/Unforgettable,"That's how the Spectator, the Observer, The New Yorker and the Guardian describe it. Unfortunately I'm not deep enough for this book. My review is simply a warning to those more superficial amongst us who happen to come accross this book. If you think this is a light Ottoman murder mystery, then forget it. I read half way through and decided I need to pick it up again when I am mature enough."
2,never caught my interest,"I seem to be in the vast majority but for me, the book moved beyond interesting and seldom reached even that."
5,"Great novel, great author","I've read it before in paper back. Short and dense chapters, wonderfully written. Historically precise, the book combines mistery, art, and authorship. Tolerance and talent are contemporary issues."
3,1600 Turkey,A well written but difficult book to follow. Provides a picture of the artistic world in the 16 th century Istanbul. The characters are not well developed and so it is difficult to empathize with them. It seemed like a dangerous place to live where your life wasn't worth very much. It provided a picture of life under the sultans and the warring factions of the times. The perceived threats to Islam from the western world don't seem to have changed very much.
5,"Fantastic, A poet who writes Novels","I have read all of his books and each time I finish one, I cannot wait for the next one, which unfortunately takes too long to come...This one however had a different effect on me..After I finished it, I still was not satisfied and had to go back to Mr. Pamuk's all other novels...Not only to enjoy the stories, but I an a way to study his writing. ""Öteki Renkler "" (Could be translated as Other Colors) was sort of helpful, but you want to know more about him and how he can write such amazingly..He is a poet considering the way he builds sentences, a great storyteller and a genius without doubt.My Name is Red is his peak, however I not only recommend this one. I recommend all of his other novels, especially Kara Kitap (Black Book).I am going to buy the english version as well, just to see how his art has been translated and to see if the taste you get is the same.."
1,"My Name Is... Boring, Boring, Boring","I loved ""Istanbul"". Thinking this one would be at least as good as the former, I bought ""My Name Is Red"". I tossed it away after, what, page 60 or so.This book is boring, boring, boring, as if Pamuk was being paid by the page to write it down. The tedious narrative in the first person by the same characters one after the other and so on and so forth, while a novelty at fist soon becomes a tiresome reading exercise. As for story development, well, I saw very few of it and, being convinced there would be little if any in the 400 pages to come, I laid the book to rest."
2,It's got it's ups and downs,"The imagery in this book is breathless, the characters vivid, and the technique interesting and unique. However, the plot is not the most interesting in the world. The murder mystery aspect of the book is a failed attempt to add a hook and make the story go somewhere. You will find that the mystery does not interest you nearly as much as the characters. Pamuk is rather wordy and tries to stuff the work with meaning and metaphors. Intead, My Name is Red comes off as floundering and contrived. If you want a good character study and a fascinating historical setting read it; if you want first class writing and a well-developed plot, look elsewhere."
1,A promising story but a disastrous translation,I tried very hard to complete this book but the American translation is frankly ridiculous. Turkish words are routinely translated into the most vulgar English equivalent. Not to mention the clumsy use of Americanisms like 'Quit it' and 'Jerk off' at least once per chapter.If you can get over the poor translating it's probably a great story but I couldn't stomach it.
5,I read about 6 years ago,"I read the book in its original language and it was fun. I was in the 16th century Istanbul for about a week (well, of course the author's perception of 16th century Istanbul), while reading this book. I don't recall what the details were, but it was interesting in the sense that objects like colors etc. were telling the story in each chapter. I had never seen that in a novel before."
1,Unfocused,"The writing is good, but where is it going. Too much information for me to follow. Maybe it is my lack of knowledge of Muslim culture and Turkish history. Whenever I go back to it I am just disapointed and bored. Too much going on, too much silliness. I just wanted it too be over! Too bad, because the cover is so interesting. One chapter alone was enough for puzzlement. Those of you who really liked it----------I don't get it at all. I don't care about the miniturists and their angst. Could have lived with just the love story or the mystery or the art history. I felt as if I was in a bad, confusing dream."
3,Why have we forgotten the history of Byzantine ?,"I like this writer's novel. The history in Europe and Asia particularly interests me. But I am amazed by the fact that the West and the world have all forgotten what happened when Ottomans took Constantinople in 1453 in the biggest bloodbath ever took place in that part of the world in history until then. (But only surpassed later by another bloodbath of the killing of one million Amanian Christians, again by the Ottomans) While I was reading this book, I could almost hear baby's crying amid the explosion and the killing of hundreds of thousands of innocent Christian men and women by the Ottoman army. Why nobody has ever written about the true history? That is why even the Turkish government always denies it and European governments always tune a blind eye on such to appease their partner. Surely, this Nobel prize winner would be more than capable of writing this important period of history."
1,Can't Pick It Up,"This book was selected for our neighborhood book club. I've been reading it for what must be a hundred days (it seems like a hundred - it might be three weeks in actuality), and I am proud to say I am on page 50. You know how people say ""I couldn't put it down"" when they are speaking about a great book? Well, ""I couldn't pick it up"" is how I will describe this book to anyone wanting an honest review. It is sluggish, overwrought, convoluted, and inconsistent - and those are its good qualities. And I, a watercolor miniaturist, should be loving this book about manuscript illuminators. Of course, I should finish all 400+ pages before I really review this paperweight. I'll do that in 2015 when I complete it."
5,Absolutely fabulous,"An extremely interesting, illuminating and erudite account of Ottoman days and how they were lived by miniaturists. Pamuk masterfully intertwins the tales of lovers, miniaturists, Ottoman bureaucracies, a murderer, even as inanimate as a coin, the color red, a tree, a horse and death as true characters. The story rolls on as a first-person narrative consisiting of the monologues of these and many other characters, unravelling the psyche of each individuals. This way the writer makes the reader read the intimate thoughts of the characters. Its also a thriller where it unlocks the secret of the death of two gifted artists. Pamuk surely had done years of hardwork on miniaturists and their ways of the art and put all of it into this book. An absolutely sumptuous reading from a Nobel Laureate master writer."
3,Worth Reading,"""My Name is Red"" has a solid start and will probably catch your interest right away. The idea of narrating not only from different humans' points of views but also from the POV of inanimate objects is engrossing and feels fresh.Despite the strong start, the book weakens towards the end. The conclusion is not very enlightening, and the last 5th of the book feels quite anticlimactic. However, if you want to get a feel for 16th century Ottoman Empire and its times/culture, then this is a must-read. I enjoyed ""My Name is Red"" despite its semi-weak plot because of the different POV's and artistic theme."
5,"My Name is Red, by Orhan Pamuk","This book is practically a must if you're going to visit Istanbul. It evokes the spirit of 16th century Topkapi in a much more exciting way than a guidebook can. Also, Pamuk inserts just enough of the extant landmarks to make you feel at home as you walk the streets of the old city. Just one example: Ibrahim Pasha's mansion. This exquisite old house has been restored and is now a hotel. The book is still a wonderful read if you're not going to visit Istanbul, but after reading it, you'll want to."
4,"four stars, because he is going to keep writing..","When I read Pamuk's this book, I thought that 'Red' is not a color itself, a color that contains all colors and a color that contains no any color (even,red) at the same time.Anybody who wish to understand Pamuk's books have to find the deepest meaning of 'being everywhere and nowhere at the same time', this can't be understood clearly and,just because of that it is pure reality. In my opinion, Pamuk's books are implying that 'There are only ways to walk but nowhere to arrive'."
2,needs explication,"This book (at least in translation) is in desperate need of an introduction. The chronology at the back is not sufficient to give some unfamiliar with the history of manuscript illumination in Istanbul any idea what's going on. An explanation of the controversy surrounding art and illumination and the tensions between Eastern and Western art would have been very helpful. As it was, the bulk of the book was completely lost on me! Which means that, overall, I can't really comment on the quality of the writing or the story, except to say that I found it very difficult to read and not at all enjoyable."
2,Bloated and in need of a good editor,"I read this for book club. I liked parts of it, but it was just too repetitive and ponderous. The weight of all of the words suffocates the love story (to the extent there is one) and the mystery. I just wanted it to be over. Blech."
3,Overly Artsy,"An interesting read, very artsy and explores the former world of Turkey. A bit too wordy at times and often too dry for my taste, but an overall decent read. I started off lovign it, and ended barely able to finish it."
4,Good book,"Good book. I strongly recommend it not only because of the story but also because of the ""style"" it was written in as well as the window that it opens into the culture of the Ottoman Empire."
4,rose petal preserves,This product is very cool. However I bought it thinking it would be thick like a jam (which i know exists) and this was more like a honey. Still very delicious with actual petals in it.
3,"NOT BAD, BUT NOT GREAT EITHER","HELPS YOU TO GROVE A SWING USING A WOOD; NOT USEFUL WITH IRONS, BECAUSE THEY DIG INTO THE ARTIFICIAL TURF."
1,swing grover,never had a chance to use it broke after a few hits. contacted the company twice to warratey or replace item and after 3 weeks no response
1,Danger! - Ball Came Off On First Swing,"Ball is cheaply attached by glued, knotted nylon line, and came flying off with on first strike. Not only did the ball come off, but blew a hole in my garage siding. Very dangerous, and low quality."
5,Great in a time crunch,"I haven't even done all the segments yet but I really like this. Amy is a great instructor,,and the moves that she presents are fresh and new....thank goodness a new approach to the same old boring lunges and squats (sorry Tami Lee). I'm amazed at the level of exhaustion I reach in just 10 minutes and still feel it the next day! Wow."
5,Another great workout from Amy Dixon!,"This workout is perfect for using selected segments to supplement a workout or to complete as one whole routine. The exercises are creative and different, and it is definitely a total body workout with cardio and strength together. As always, Amy is positive and encouraging. The first cardio segment starts into heart pounding moves quickly, and the cool down is excellent."
4,Be Smart!,"This book has great content. My group of thirteen 5th graders is enjoying the book a great deal. However, the teacher needs to be smart about how to take concepts that are WAY above the heads of this age group and make them understandable. I wasn't too impressed with the books explanations. Using only the book I still got blank stares back from my group. An example of this would be the importance of historical, geographical, and cultural context. The book gave abstract examples that were not helpful to the kids. It took some time and some more age relevant examples for the kids to get those concepts. With that said, I still think this book is worthy of consideration."
3,A good book for Christian Kids,A good book for Christian Kids who are hungry to know more not for kids who don't have any kind of church background or for beginners.
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"Ok, I thought I was getting a heck of a deal because it's $4.49 at the grocery store for one jar and this was listed as (6 X 8oz)and the shipping weight was listed as 6 lbs. Well, it's only one jar for over $1o so I returned it. I just received an email that indicated I returned it because of ""late shipping"". That was not the case! It was fraudulent because of advertising. They have since changed the wording of the description but wasted my time nonetheless."
4,A Good Quick Flavor Boost,"This is the first organic soup base that I have purchased and tasted. It is a good and fast flavor boost when you make your own chicken stock and it is organic and free from MSG! I also used it to flavor the chicken entrees I make at home as the base is mild and not overpowering, without the need to add salt and other flavoring sauces."
1,Avoid!,"I received this collection (the ""Essential Charlie Chaplin Collection"" box set from Delta Entertainment) as a gift, watched about five minutes, and returned it right away. It is a cheap public domain set to which no apparent thought or care has been given.An example: In the middle of ""Easy Street,"" you suddenly hear a break in the music and people talking. Why? Because the producers of this collection just threw any old public domain music onto the soundtrack, in this case an old blues song in which the musicians begin talking and laughing. It's a great song, to be sure, but totally inappropriate and distracting, having nothing to do with the action on-screen and really ruining the experience.I should add that the prints look terrible.Save your money."
1,There's a better box set out there,"I bought a box set at Sam's Club, an 8 DVD set for $18.88. The quaility of the films are very nice, and although the music is not the original, it's not bad and it was funny to hear the theme from the movie ""The Sting"". Well worth the low price.The brand name is Platinum Disc Corporation."
2,Not what I ordered either,"Like the previous reviewer stated, this is not the same product pictured. I ordered this for my mom based on her description. So I was expecting the Olay Quench Body Lotion for Extra Dry Skin, as pictured. Be careful when you order and DON'T assume your purchase is correct just on the photos. They can be misleading."
2,"GOOD, BUT TO SPARKLY","I WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT THIS HAD I KNOW, THAT THIS LOTION MAKES YOUR SKIN LOOK LIKE YOU STUCK IT IN GLITTER. THIS LOTION, IS GOOD, BUT WAY TO SPARKLY. I WON'T BE BUYING TI AGIAN!"
4,Good Tool,"This tool fits a large number of items on my bike. I've used it for derailer and chainring repairs so far. I've checked the tool's fit on various parts and it seems to cover the components except for the larger ones like bottom bracket, headset or pedals.While reasonably solid, it would be unrealistic to expect it to replace the tools in my shop-grade toolbox. It's made to go with you when you ride and improve your chances of riding back if something goes wrong.Other good items to ride with...-Tire Irons-patch kit and/or spare tube-pump"
4,"Tools good, durability bad","The tools on this device are excellent for on the road bicycle repair, and it's small enough to carry in your saddle bag. The down side is that the clip holding the two halves together broke, and the chain tool is a separate doodad. So now I have three pieces floating around. Sooner or later one of the pieces is going to get lost."
3,Nice but....,"Great recipes, but you need a scale to measure products. I also didn't like the fact that no oven temperatures were given unless you have an oven from England. If this book is to be sold in the US market, the editors could have at least adapted the information to our standards. I'm no amateur in the kitchen, but someone who is will have a tough time calculating oven temps. The layout of the recipes could've been better by listing the ingredients and then instructions. Instead it was done in a paragraph form which can make it confusing. All in all I'll keep the book, but am a bit disappointed with how it was put together."
2,GAVE THIS TO MY BROTHER,"Small print, no photos, mostly fish main dishes. I did not like the book. Gave this to my brother as he likes fish and cooking. He was glad to get it."
1,A total disappointment,"After reading some very positive reviews, I grabbed this book with much expectation. What a mistake that turned out to be. More than anything else, I found the author's prose superfluous -- that the sentences were *overwritten* simply for the sake of sounding nice. Unlike McEwan or Chabon who would easily leave me in awe, I found myself bemused and cringing from the apparent ""over-effort"" on William's part. I also found it difficult to relate to the characters who seemed all too eager to abandon their family in the time of need. How likely was this in the first place? There were also many episodes along their adventure which were disjointed and seemingly unnecessary. And o yes, this is the first book EVER that I couldn't finish (left it with 100 pages to go)."
1,like it,"I actually havent started or read it, but im sure i will like it because i have done something similar from beht moore so i sure i will like it."
5,Great Insight,Beth Moore's study of Daniel makes the book of Daniel in the Bible so relevant to life today. Our government and society pressures us to compromise our faith and morals just as Daniel experienced. She also relates the book to other passages in the Bible so we see the very exciting plan of God for this world and his people.
5,Essential for our times,"In Daniel, Beth Moore has created a challenging Bible study on a level with Breaking Free. From the first session, each CD and daily lesson reveal more about God's work through faithful believers--despite intense pressure to conform to society. The prophetic sessions are applicable daily as our world careens toward end times."
5,Daniel review,This is a very organized and thorough way to study the Book of Daniel. Beth Moore makes it very interesting with her enthusiasm in explaining the details of the historical times as well as spiritual information.
2,Ugh!,This was described as like new and written on a few pages...it was written on in 90% of the book...that is not a few pages!
3,Beth Moore Daniel,The book came in a timely manner. It was in the condition reported upon purchase. Only complaint is the book smelled badly of cigarette smoke. Otherwise in great condition.
4,Great Study,This has been a great study! I would highly recommend it. You do need to watch the videos with it so make sure you have access to them.
5,A Great Way to Understand What Everybody's Talking About,"There's a lot of talk nowadays about end times, and most of the information comes out of the Bible's book of Daniel. Like any book of prophecy, Daniel can make your head spin as you try to put the pieces together. Beth Moore does a really great job of bringing understanding and depth to this hard-to-understand book. With her usual great scholarship and humor, Moore sure makes you understand why people are talking about the imminent return of Jesus. You'll either get excited or get your socks scared off, but you'll have the knowledge you need to understand how it goes. I also watched the DVD's that go with this book, and I would recommend that approach."
2,Disappointing and no Superman,"A body is found draped on the Superman statue in Metropolis, ILL, and a small town mystery needs to be solved by the local sheriff. As a long term Superman fan (I have literally more than 1000 Superman comic books), I was, of course, drawn to this first book min a series.Alas, I was quite disappointed. The local characters were well drawn, but the underlying mystery was not very interesting. In other words, as a police procedural, it just didn't draw my attention. Take away Superman (who played no role), and for me it was just kind of blah- very ordinary.I found some typos/formatting issues in the Kindle edition, but nothing too serious."
4,A well-written who-done-it.,"I thought this was a pretty well-crafted mystery. Who can resist a mystery in Metropolis? I didn't know ""who done it"" until the end, something that's important to me when I read a murder mystery. I hate it when after the first chapter I know who the murder is. I look forward to reading more Metropolis Mystery books or rather e-books."
4,the juice is in the writing,"After meeting the author and finding him interesting, I decided to read his book. Although Name the Baby does seem to be a bit of a 90s Catcher in the Rye, its poignancy and freshness set it apart and ensure that it's not just a Salinger re-hash. Sam's style of thinking (or, more aptly, Cirino's style of writing) moves to a real-thought tempo. We are not just inside Sam's mind for the sound bites, but for his whole journey. Name the Baby is filled with asides, which give the novel its flavor. Sam's ruminations are often funny, usually insightful and perceptive, and almost always jaded. Cirino's language is crisp, direct, fluid, alive. His style of writing is the real gem of the novel."
4,A Moving and Well-Written Book,"I decided to pick up this book after being lucky enough to have Mark Cirino as a teacher at NYU. Throughout Name the Baby I felt a connection to the narrator. I felt that his emotions and motivations really came through. I also liked the subtle, dark humor of the writing. It's a deep read, and a novel that you can go back to again."
4,Easy to Read,It feels as if Mark Cirino is telling you the story himself in person. I liked it because he talks about places I've been. It was easy to relate to.
2,Shredder clogs,"The shredder seems to function great until you look underneath and realize there is a support bar right in the middle of the blades. This bar collects paper and becomes clogged easily. One solution it to keep it running between shredding and hope the paper falls out on its own so you dont have to clear the blades after a handful of papers. It states that it is capable of handling 10 sheets, however, i am afraid to put more than 2-3 at a time as you can hear the motor struggle. The paper i shred isnt anything special, I usually shred bills and items i print out. I have yet to find a decent shredder and the one positive of this one is that it has lasted longer than most i have owned."
2,Paper everywhere when you TRY and empty the basket.,"I have this shredder in white; it shreds great but get ready for a BIG MESS when you pull the basket out to empty it. Also, if you try to prevent the mess by TRYING to get the top off, forget it. To get the top off, you have to turn the machine upside down or get someone really strong to get it off for you; it's that heavy."
1,Terrible support!,"We have had a royal shredder for a few years now, and it is a huge dissapointment. It is not dependable, but the worst thing is the manufacturer is nowhere to be found! Forget service for it--forget Royal Shredders!!!!!"
1,Do not use this thing,I have had this shredder for a couple of years and used it lightly over that time. Today I was trying to shred some things for the end of the year and the entire unit blew up in my face! The hair on the back of my hand was burned off and the paper in basket started smoldering.
1,"Jams constantly, and the ON button broke in 30 days","The on/off button broke within 30 days, the shredder jams, no way it will handle 10 pages. I'd limit it to about 3-4 pages at most, but it still jams constantly. It's very loud and credit cards will clog it although the owners manual says they are fine. I just bought a Fellowes dm12c. So far it's a vastly better product. I regret ever having the Royal as it's now just going into a landfill."
1,HORRIBLE,I had a lower model Royal for years without a problem. So disappointed it broke the second time I used it and Royal will not call me back. Stuck with a lemon.
2,cliche,"This was a little cliche for my taste. It covered all foods that are well known and personally have no effect on me. Things like oysters, and asparagess. Good food not aphrosisiacs. I read this book years ago before the releagalization of absinthe so that isn't covered, but I find it dose work. save yourself the money on this book and but absinthe."
3,fans should really enjoy this.,"Well to be honest this was kinda a compulsory purchase. i had not heard any of SIP before but they really hyped Trophy so i assumed it should be good. and there's nothing really wrong w/ this album. the reason i only gave it 3 stars is that being more a metal fan, i had a hard time getting into the hardcore vox. still the whole record is really heavy. it really doesn't let up and from a musical standpoint i loved this album. the monotone vocals just weren't my thing. so if you're a SIP fan this is a great sophomore record. and the lyrics are well written."
2,Not worth it,"There is no reason for you to buy this album. This is pretty bland metalcore with some occasional acoustic parts thrown in to break the repetition. No doubt this band has talent, but they really need to step up their songwriting. If you want a good metalcore album, check out ""We Are Gathered Here Today..."" by Glass Casket."
5,best little CF card hold,"I love this little Compact Flash (CF) card holder and have been using it for over a year for my photography. Not only is the case soft and flexible (great for packing in tight with your camera gear) - it holds a good deal of CF cards (6 at least, and a big pocket on the end that could hold 2 more). It's secured by a nice zipper and the back belt loop is strong with a velcro bottom so you can strap this onto the loops of other Lowepro bags, etc for quick access. The best but expensive here at [...]+ shipping. You can get it for [...] elsewhere."
1,Poor design,The wallet was a big disappointment.They are too small to hold the flash cards in their flipcases. also trying to zip it up when you are finishedis really a chore.Save Your hard earned money and keep looking for abetter product
5,A Classic,"Every reviewer here is right. This is a classic album. The songs on it all keep a flow to the CD that never wears out. When it comes down to key moments on the disc, Mellencamp laid out with such exquisite beauty tracks like Between a Laugh and a Tear, Minutes to Memories,Rain on the Scarecrow, Rumbleseat, and Small Town, that half the album is unforgettable. The rest of the album is good filler, more rock out tunes, some social commentary- Face of the Nation, Justice and Independence, ROCK, Lonely Ol' Night. This album yielded five top 40 hits, there's no question why when you listen to it. John Mellencamp simply sang from his soul honest songs about the people he knew. Instead of the people being junkies from LA, they were regular men and women of the midwest. It still stands a perfect roots-rock album for any time and place."
5,Best Sunscreen ever,THis product has titanium oxide in it which BLOCKS the sun's rays. It also has no odor and is not greasy. It works wonderfully!
5,Dry- Brick III,"Received Dry-Brick in time specified, but with postage due. Product is what I ordered and resembles what I am currently using for my aids."
5,Excellent service,I need this product for my hearing aid. I am trying another product that looks cheaper. I hope that I will be able to save money.
4,"What can Ii say, if you need it you need it.","Having my aids and CI last longer is my aim.And this product was recommended for my Zephyr drying machine.The briks do the job, and I use the device every night."
4,Dri-Brik II Desiccant blocks do more than they say,"I have been using it for a few years and it not only cleans my hearing, but, my batteries last longer.Anthony J. Lanzillotti"
5,Dry-Brilk Desiccant Blocks,"Very good price. I hope they last a long time, ended up buying 2 years supply. Shipment was quite fast and as said great price."
4,Just as the dr. ordered,THESE ARE IDENTICAL TO WHAT MY HEARING AID DR. GAVE ME TO START OFF WITH. SEEM TO WORK JUT FINE.
3,Dry-Brik II Desiccant from Amazon,"This product appears satisfactory but with 2 refills now, pushing hard on the pushing button has not started the progression of a red border that is supposed to indicate exhaustion of the drying capacity. Audiologist advises that one should simply use 2 months of nightly drying as a guideline.What about the copper tape against one of the sides? Is the user supposed to remove this upon installation? Unclear."
5,Dry-Brix II,I've been using this product for several years and find that it works very well to keep my hearing aid dry and functional.
5,Better value than purchasing from the manufacture.,Best to order extra amounts for those time you will need themLooks like the original packaging that comes from the manufacture.
4,Desiccants Blocks,These desiccants seems to do the job. I just change them every two months. Keeps out any moisture and also helps keeps aids clean.
3,"playful,ambient soundscapes","Fans of Yoshimi's OOIOO should have no trouble liking this,it's even more ambient and sparse than said group.You really get the feeling they are inspired by their trip up the mountain,just sitting around soaking in everything and playing what comes to mind.Neo-tribal drums,synth squiggles,beautiful piano melodies,occasional chanting/wordless vocalizing,snippets of passerbys,dogs,plenty of birds,even the hum of the truck they are riding in swirl in,out and around the listener.The overall vibe I get from this is ""playful"",it's not earth shattering,it's not so bland as to be disposable.Just playful soundscapes."
4,OK Mouse,"Fast shipment, appears to be satisfactory, but did not have the type connection that I thought I was ordering, based on the description."
4,"Good ramp top, but you are buying only one","The ramp top is well made and does the job when connected to a heavy duty board. However, I thought I was buying two ramp tops. It was only one. I had to order a second one to load my riding lawn mower onto my pickup truck."
5,A great building/friendship experience with Bob,"Another of Bob's adventures full of action. Workmanship, friendship, and even sportsmanship. My 5-yr old has watched again and again. Absolutely worth of keeping!"
3,Not the book I wanted.,"Great book, just not the cover design I wanted also it was promoted on the site as the black cover, which is what I wanted."
5,Two are better than one,"I have a diagnosis of Neuropathy, along with this I suffer severe night leg cramps, the kind that bring on the tears. I have tried night splints before but not only werre they uncomfortable, hard to apply , and difficult to stand in. I saw the night wrap on Amazon and ordered one. It was comfortable, I could put it on alone and not only could I stand in it, but also walk in it well enought to get to the bathroom. In less than a week I ordered a second one. The leg cramps have almost disappeared, I love these things!!!!!!"
2,Too tight,"The sound quality is fine and the price is quite reasonable, but the headphones are much too tight for me, and I have a relatively small head. There is no way to adjust the tension and they need to be tight since they don't rest on the top of your head, but simply press upon your ears to keep from sliding down. Better headsets (of all kinds - look at what airline pilots wear) have a pad on top.Not much fun to wear for extended periods; I'd look at someting else."
3,"Good sound quality, tight fit","I purchased this headset almost 3 months ago now, and after regular daily use I'd say overall it works great. The sound quality is superb, and the microphone works fantastic. The inline volume control and mute is convenient, though I find myself accidentally hitting the mute on occasion during a conversation.The only negative I have for this headset is the comfort. While the size adjustment may be fine for some people, it becomes quite painful for those outside the ""average"" this was intended for. The padding on the earpieces is acceptable for a short time use, but much more that and hour or two causes me significant discomfort around my ears. And for those with glasses be warned, this headset will press your glasses into your head in a most unfortunate way.Overall good headset that I'll be using until I can find one more comfortable."
5,"Good Sound Quality, Convenient Volume Control","I needed a headset for audio chat on MSN Messenger and Skype when I realized that my new laptop has no microphone input. I am very pleased with the sound quality of the microphone. The earphone portion of the unit sounds very good when listening to voices on the other end and fairly good when listening to music. In addition, having the volume control right on the cable is very convenient.The two qualities I enjoy best are:1) Crisp sound from the microphone, giving me the confidence that whoever hears me on the other end will have high-quality sound; and2) The main processing chip detects when the incoming signal is monophonic or stereophonic and adapts accordingly."
2,"Uncomfortable, Doesn't Last","While initially pleased with the microphone design (smoothly moves out of the way when not in use) and sound quality of this headset, I found it had two major failings.1) Extremely uncomfortable.2) Fragile wiring. Failing after only a couple months of use.I would not recommend buying this product."
2,Uncomfortable!!,"That's the first thing I thought when I put these things on. After an hour or so of wearing them, I must have consciously adjusted them at least 15 times because of the pain. Another problem I've encountered is that the mute button will periodically decide to activate itself. The blinking blue light will catch my eyes and I'll realize the headset decided to mute itself again. Whether or not this is because I wasn't using the mic, or because I had it in the up position I don't know but it should not go mute unless I click the button to make it mute. Another problem, that's actually a major problem in my book, is that I can't use the adjustable volume control on the headset. So, I'm forced to use the volume control either in Windows or in the game I'm playing. As for the sound quality, I would say it's so-so. This was an impulse buy for me and I'm regretting it."
3,"Works great, horrible customer service","Heaven forbid you try to use the warranty on this product, it's useless. Might as well get two for when the first one has a horrible death or stops working on you."
3,Great features but very uncomfortable,"This headset worked great right out of the box with my MacBook Pro and my PC. Audio is clear both ways, the volume controller works great, but my only complaint is that after a few minutes of use they get very uncomfortable as there isn't any kind of padding on the top part of the headset (and I've got a small head). Using the headset while wearing glasses is quite uncomfortable as well, even if I tilt my glasses. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to find another headset that's more comfortable than this."
2,Consider Carefully,"I had this model about 6 months, light use (1-3 times/week) before it died. The mic would no longer transmit and the sound remained stuck at max. After removing/re-installing the driver it was still the same, which was no real loss since they were not very comfortable in the first place."
5,Excellent,I have been using this headset for a while now and am thrilled with its quality. Comfortable to wear and very good voice quality.
2,"don't get these ""premium"" ones","don't get these ""premium"" ones. I've bought a lot of usb headsets, and this particular model is annoying because (1) the earphone parts aren't deep enough and so your ear gets squished, and (2) that dumb medallion with the volume clicker on it dangles... truly annoying. get the standard logitech ones, silver colored -- they fit and don't have that volume medallion thing."
2,Broke within one year of purchase.,"Recently, these headphones began to transmit only half of the sounds sent to them. Generally, I don't mind when electronics break, it's just something that happens over time. However, considering that I purchased these headphones less than a year ago, I'm disappointed that they malfunctioned so quickly.This product worked quite well until it prematurely broke though, which is why I haven't given it one star."
2,Very tight - gives headache & mic stopped working,It is a nice looking headset and I generally like logitech products. But it is really tight no matter how I tried to adjust. Mic stopped working after about a week. Maybe it is just a bad set.
4,logitech headset w/mic,This is the second set of this exact headset I have owned and have found it to be comfortable. This item was delivered quickly and with little fuss.
4,Superb Sound Quality...Decent Fit,"this headset has great sound quality, good bass and can't complain at all with the sound it produces. Although it may not go all around your ears, It does it's job of blocking out most outside noise . But the problem to this is the pads begin to put pressure on my ears after 2 or more hours of use.(I got pretty big ears!) Overall i'd recommend this headset because it provides beautiful sound, and I've also had mine for 6 months and running."
4,"sounds great, but painful","I've used this for over a year and it's been flawless, I've recommended it to everyone in my wow guild and I think there's been 9 positive responses vs. the 1 negative. Totally clear, no setup hassels thanks to it being USB. I always recommend USB to people because it allows you to split your audio output when using 3rd-party chat programs when online-gaming - I pipe my game through the system speakers and direct the chat audio through the headphones.Unlike the review below, I've stood up or spun in my chair half a dozen times ripping the headphones off my head and mine are still rock-solid; they've been completely durable in my mind.Unfortunately exactly like another review below, the stupid things are too tight on your ears and hurt. After gaming for a few hours, my ears are almost too sore to lay my ears on my pillow when I'm going to bed.Outside of the too-tight issue causing sore ears, these things are awesome and I still recommend them to ppl."
2,Not Durable,I have owned 3 pair of these headphone in the past year. I should have given up after the first pair. If you turn your head too quickly you will rip the wires out of the ear piece and bye bye head set. If you lose track on how the microphone is turned you may turn it 360 degrees too many times and trash that wire. Logitech makes some good stuff but not Head sets.
2,A PC Headset that works great but hurts like hell...,"This headset has crystal clear sound,a good mic and is simple to hook up to your pc(simply plug it in to the usb port).The big issue with this product is that if you use it for more than 20 minutes your ears feel like they are on fire.I use this product while playing multiplayer games online and i have to say that this headset pinches your ears so tightly that you have to take them off often just to get the circulation back in your head.If you want to use this product for a long period of time at your pc your ears WILL hurt.If you dont mind the constant ear pain then you should buy this."
4,great purchase,"Great ease with plug and play, the quality of the sound is great, no complaints at all. This is my first headset for my computer, so I have nothing to compare it to. I can't give it more than 4 stars because the earpieces are comfortable enough for periodic use, but I probably wouldn't want to wear them for hours on end. Still, positively recommended."
2,Great sound -- when they work,"I've had mine for almost a year now; when they work, sound is clear as a bell and the mic is the best I've used.Every so often, however, something happens and the sound distorts. It's kind of like the sound of an FM synthesizer with bad parameters."
4,Good Headset for the price,"I am very happy with the headset. The sound is good, the cord is plenty long and the installation on my Mac was a breeze. My only gripe is a minor one, maybe it's because I have a big head, but I find that after about 45 minutes they get a bit painful where the headpiece grips my head."
2,Good Sound but Uncomfortable,"The sound on this headphone is great although I haven't tried the use of the microphone. My only problem and a big problem for me is that after having the headphone for sometime, your ears start to hurt. Not sure why the design is the way it is. I used to have a BOSE headphone w/o a microphone and they were very light and comfortable. I know BOSE is BOSE but Logitech could have spent some time on the design, not just the technology."
2,Alright for the money,I have been in search of a good headset. I needed SUB because I want to be able to seperate my Voice communications from PC audio.This headset would not install on my windows XP SP2 machine. It turns out that was a problem with my windows install being damaged in some whay that did not even allow for SP2 to be reinstalled.A fresh install of XP and the headset was installed without problem. The performance was alright but I found the ear pads to be too hard. They would start hurting my ears after about 1 hr.
1,"broke, replaced","used one month then stopped working. Hassle getting replaced, nothing like returning to the store, but replaced head set has worked for one week now so fingers crossed."
3,"Good performance, too uncomfortable","I own one of these and I've used it for a while. It works well and sound quality is good, but I've found it quite uncomfortable -- it puts a LOT of pressure on the ears.Last night I gave up and bought a Sony DR260-USB, which is much more comfortable, and has a technical advantage (you can use it as USB or with the older mic/headphone plugs):[...]."
3,"Breaks Easily, But Good Overall","I've had three of these headsets in the past 2 years, one lasted for six months, the next also lasted for six months and the last pair that just broke the other day I had for a year. It is a great headset except that it breaks so darn easily! The cords on the upper half of the headset are so thin that it snaps really easily. The cord on the lower half is really think, though. The microphone is decent quality, but nothing to ride home about. It is very comfortable with padded cushions and the sound is great.Worth a buy for the cheap price, but don't expect it to last very long."
3,Decent,"I've owned three pairs of these that I got as gifts and the mic stopped working on all three. Everything else about this headset is great, but the mics just dont last. The wiring is weak and bad connections form so if you wiggle it a bit the mic works for a time but then will stop working again. Should be stronger reinforcing on the wire"
1,Don't buy this product!,"I thought I bought a ""premium"" headset for my Skype conversations... Not so!The sound drops constantly, sometimes it's on the left side sometimes on the right side. Then mute button suddenly stopped working and nothing will bring it back to life (...again bad wiring/poor product quality). Also, I find this headset to be very uncomfortable to wear for longer periods of time.When it works the sound is great for both headphone and microphone. Problem is it doesn't work consistently! Hence, it's useless and I have to say: Don't by this product.UPDATE: After my initial review I complained to Logitech and they promptly sent me a new headset free of charge... Great service, however, on day one using the new headset I have the same problems! The sound drops when you accidentally touch the cable. Don't buy this product."
2,Dies after three months,"I'm disappointed that the headset stopped working just the other day. I bought one (obviously used) in May, but it smelled so badly of cigarettes I became nauseous. I immediately contacted the seller who was kind enough to send another pair. I think I received this set in early June. I had it plugged into the USB drive and the PC told me it could no longer recognize the hardware because the USB end went south. I tested other devices on the USB port and it was fine, so it was definitely this particular set that had gone bad and not the port itself.Unfortunately, despite the good sound and relative comfort, I would never purchase a Logitech headset again because the quality is lacking in the most basic way possible."
1,unwearable,"This headset wins the ""most uncomfortable"" design award. I tried to use it for 2 days than gave it away. It was a waste of money!"
2,Great unless you have ears.,"To truly appreciate these headphones you must modify the way you listen. First off, cut off your ears. Why you may ask? Because you will want to after having these things on your head for 2 to 3 seconds. Other then that the audio sounded as though your speaking from inside a colon. All in all these things probbaly taste better then they sound. My ears are still bleeding. Also if you want to use this with skype, don't use it with a beta version as it auto modulates the sound so that your friends can barely hear you if your voice is even a octive above a whisper."
3,WHY?,"I DO LIKE THE STEREO SPEAKERS. BUT I AM TRYING TO USE THE MIC. IT SOUNDS SO EASY, BUT IT IS NOT WORKING. I HAVE TRIED SO MANY TIMES, AND FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS, BUT IT JUST DON'T WORK. I HAVE FRIENDS THAT WANT TO TALK, BUT I JUST CAN'T GET THE MIC TO WORK. WHY? IT IS DRIVIING ME CRAZY."
5,Great Headset,"I needed to record audio for a PowerPoint presentation. Not only was the price very reasonable, but the noise suppression worked far better than I expected. Despite a variety background noise (cars, etc.) my recordings came out sounding great. Highly recommended."
2,Uncomfortable,"My father had a pair of these lying around the house, and I decided to try them out when my old headset's microphone stopped working. I'm 5'4, female, very tiny, and these were so uncomfortable on my ears that even though the sound quality was great, I couldn't wear them for more than a half-hour at a time. I don't wear glasses, though I do have one earring on the top cartilage of my left ear, both ears hurt badly."
4,"great sound, mediocre design","I wear glasses and this headset pushes on my ears too hard. I can't wear it for more than 1 hours - my ears hurt really bad! :) Aside from that the headset is great. The sound is high quality, the mic works great (no noise, really) and the fact that is uses USB is a big plus. I do not have front audio port, but I do have a USB one."
2,My ears feel crushed,"Now you may be thinking that it may be that my head is too big, but I assure you that it is of average size ;-)These headphones are like cheap airline headsets and regardless of sound quality are very uncomfortable for more than 5 minutes of use. The Speakers rest directly on your ears and the padding is no where near deep enough to ease the discomfort. Very cheap build indeed ... they look cool but don't be fooled!Also, for those of us follically challenged, the hard plastic top bar is also uncomfortable.I guess this is the problem with buying on the Net, you can't just take a real look at them - otherwise I would have stayed clear."
3,"Works good, but uncomfortable","The headset works as promised. But I have many little complaints that keep this only an average product instead of a great product.* The ear pads are too thin which cause the inner metal screeen to be pressed on the ears. It doesn't take long to hurt.* There is no marking which is left and which is right.* The microphone is on the right ear, but if you perfer the left then the stereo sound is backwards with no way to switch. Since this is their ""premium"" version I would expect it to automatically switch when you bring the microphone to point in the other direction.This product is acceptable for use with voice recording or VoIP for short periods but I can not recomment for long term use like listening to music for hours."
1,Bad headset,"I bought these a couple of days ago and loathe them. They sound great, but if you can't wear them it's useless. After about 30 seconds your ears start to ache and don't stop aching until you pass out from pain. Logitech should have tested them on people not rodents. I don't normally bother with reviews, but this product is such a stinker I couldn't help myself.I'm taking them back tomorrow."
2,Don't waste your time.,"I ordered this to replace a Plantronics headset. I returned them because they are uncomfortable and the volume/mute switch is very hard to use.The fit is very tight, with very little padding on the ear or over the top of your head; if you are a 'conehead' these might actually work for you, though. :) I adjusted these to the shortest they could be but the speakers still sat below the bottom of my ears, and I'm no tiny person.Combining the mute and volume control is a great idea, but the switch rarely worked properly. You push the button squarely in the center to mute, push up/down to in/decrease volume. Every time I tried adjusting the volume, I would mute the microphone, and vice versa. Perhaps my set was defective but taking 5-6 'pushes' on the +/- side of the switch to adjust the volume up/down 1 notch is unacceptable.The best thing about this headset is the USB PnP ability.I'd suggest you avoid these and purchase the Plantronics DS-500 for about $10 more, instead."
1,Cheap and uncomfortable.,"I've used Logitech products for years now. These were very disappointing. The ear cups are round and don't fit over your ears properly. The wire from the USB connector up to the inline volume controller is thick, but then they go to a cheaper thin wire from there up to the headset. The headset worked for about a week then it started shorting out where the thin wire comes out of the control. I finally got so fed up with the intermittent connection, I broke open the volume control (it's glued together, btw) only to find VERY tiny wires that were shorting out and so small you could never solder/rewire them yourself. They need to use more solid components and wire that is thicker than a human hair. Terrible design. Don't waste your $. Go for the MS LifeChat LX-3000 instead."
5,"Ridiculous price, what the heck?",The hardware's great.The price is insane -- 10 times what it should be.Don't buy from this vendor unless the price falls below $30.
1,Not for recording,"I've bought this product to record audiobooks for the public domain. When I record, I get cracks and squeaks in the recording that make it almost impossible to sound anywhere near professional. It might work well for Skype, but don't use it if your trying to record anything."
4,Logitech USB Headset 350 - very reliable,"We are using the headset primarily with Skype, and it works beautifully. I bought one for family members, who are spread around the planet: when we speak, we sound as if we were in the same room, with the full voice spectrum faithfully reproduced. The only drawback is the mute button, which turns itself on after a while, and is so large that you can easily bump it on the side of your desk and mute yourself by mistake. A visual on the screen would be helpful to indicate you are muted. Otherwise, a great product!"
1,A Piece Of Garbage,"I bought these for my teenage daughter to use on Internet voice chat. Within a month the flimsy wire started fraying and I knew it was only a matter of time before it cut out and stopped working completely. But even before the thin wire gave way, it started cutting out and crackling within a few weeks of use. Dropping them on carpeting causes the earpieces to snap out of their holders. It was only a matter of time before the plastic snaps broke completely. The flimsy wire also has a twisting problem over continued use. I should have returned them while I still had the chance. After a few months of use they were totally shot. You would expect to get more use out of them for the price. DO NOT under any circumstances buy these for children. They will destroy them in no time. They are not designed for any type of robust use. Even for adult use, you will have to treat these gingerly to get any prolonged use out of them. A total waste of money!"
1,it worked for less than 2 months,I'm waiting for Kraft to start making baby food out of broken electronics made in China.
1,Fragile Junk,I've now returned two of these after a couple days use due to issues with static and a microphone that cuts in and out and random. Apparently this model is very fragile and wires work their way loose easily. A friend has had a similar problem with a third sample. I would avoid this poorly manufactured product.
1,"How about ""I Returned this Item""","I had a Logitech headset mic that I liked and really was comfortable, but it no longer worked when I upgraded to Vista, so I ordered a set that I was told would work with Vista. The head set worked, actually, but it was so heavy , awkward and uncomfortable to wear that I returned it to Amazon. The redesign of the head set, they have added these fake leather bits around the ears and these HUGE HUGE ear covers that did nothing but make my ears sweat (I didn't realize my ears sweated before I had these God-awful headphones on) and in general they screwed up a really good product. I really do not reccomend them, except perhaps as torture devices."
3,"Decent, but they will break on you eventually","I have owned two of these headsets and in both cases, they served me well for several months, but they eventally fall apart. If they were a bit more sturdy, they might actually be worth the $80 price tag, but for that kind of money, you can find better."
3,Quality Sound and Mic,"The sound quality is good. The mic is good. Many people find the headset uncomfortable. I however do not have any concerns with the comfort level. I would not say it is super confortable and I would not say it is unconfortable. Comfort is somewhere in the middle between good and bad.That said, the little blue power light did not work. This is important because the light indicates if you are muted. I exchanged it for a the same model and the exchange item works properly. If it was not for the ""broken"" blue light on the original purchase I would have rated this product with four stars."
4,Good for the price but a bit uncomfortable,"Easy to use, easy to install, good performance but, as others had mention it can be a bit uncomfortable if used for longer periods of time.I am using it for Rosseta Stone speech recognition and the performance is excellent.I think it is a great product for the price (around US25)"
1,too tight,"While the sound is just ok, the headset is far too tight on the ears. Only takes an hour for your ears to start hurting, and it gets worse after time. Doesn't seem to be any way to fix this issue."
2,"good sound, hurts ears,cheap cords-","These looks great! Sound is fine (i use hd sound card) so most headsets i use sound good!but these, like many others i try just really press on my head and the pain begins (after an hour or so)(my head is small) I think its because the ear cups are to close to the speaker? not enough air between the 2 so the ear touches the inner part? I went through 2 of these (one was my ladys) the problem is the thin string like cords! they ball up and crimp like mad! and one side quits working! and the mic button turns off or on with hardly touching it! thats a pain! these are great looking but really not so good!"
2,Unhappy,"I am so sorry not been doing a research prior to buying the headset and now I have to live with it.The cushion pads are hard and it's a torturing experience. The designer should have left the pads on the side, have the plastic by itself and probably will be the same, and at least cheaper."
1,Nice but broke quick! 2 Times!!,I purchased these in the fall and they lasted until January - the right ear quit working. So I purchased new ones and the exact same thing happened. Kinda upsetting!
2,Very uncomfortable. I wish I had listened to other reviewers,"I wish I had listened to the other reviewers on how uncomfortable this headset is. Maybe it's fine if you have a thin head, but I think I have probably an average sized head and it is extremely uncomfortable to wear for any extended period of time. Having said that, I really only use this headset for Webex meetings and the sound quality is good. And I'm told that the mic on the headset works well too."
2,Not stood test of time!,I agree with all comments about sound quality etc but having used them extensively for quite some time the sound cuts in and out between left and right channels. The problem relates to poor anchorage where the cable enters the headset. It would be reasonably easy to rectify if you could take them to bits but it does not look like they are built for that. Final opinion...very dissatisfied!
2,Ouch! What a Painful Purchase,"After reading numerous reviews that mentioned these headphones being uncomfortable, I decided to take a risk and buy them anyway. I needed to get some good headphones for podcasting on my iBook and these fit the bill. Based on the price and my brand loyalty to Logitech I figured it couldn't be that bad, right? Wrong.Pros:-Plug and play with Mac works great-Affordable-Decent sound qualityCons:-They most definitely hurt my ears, almost right away too! READ: Not Comfortable!-Feel like they could snap in half-Non-foldable makes storage a painI do not recommend this headphones, I'm returning them this weekend for the Plantronics DSP-400 USB headset. I can deal with a little bit of uncomfort, but these headphones just plain hurt."
3,Functional,"Seems to look and work great, but the mute button is so easy to press that I accidentally mute myself all the time. I am using a Macintosh computer and the volume buttons seem to raise and lower the speaker volume but not the headset volume."
4,Reliable to use,"I've been using these headphones with OS X 10.4 for TeamSpeak (using the TeamSpeex software) and Skype (both the release and beta versions) and have found that the USB connection delivers a reliable and easy to manage connection between the headset and the computer. Granted, it should be noted that the USB connection is more susceptible to audio ""lag"" when process loads are high versus a headset that plugs into the computer's 1/8"" jacks. The trade off is (for me) for being able to quickly plug in the headset that I only occasionally use into the front USB ports of my computer, and then quickly disconnect and store them away. Having said that, I would describe the times that my audio stuttered due to a busy computer as ""rare""."
2,Expensive for noting special.,This headset doesn't have anything special (for the price) more than its USB connectivity. Sometimes I have noise problems with the mic.
1,easily broken,"I bought these headphones and was quickly disappointed. They fit too tight on my head, so I couldn't wear them for long. My son took about two seconds to break them (they aren't made well). I have a pair of sony monitor headphones that my son has practically chewed to pieces, but they are still going strong.I'm looking for new headphones now (with a mic for gaming) but I wanted to write a review so other people could avoid wasting their money."
1,Uncomfortable and unreliable,"As other reviews have mentioned, the headphones aren't very comfortable. The padding is thin and the ear cups provide pressure all over the ear, instead of around the ear.The headset performed well for a couple months, and then suddenly the left channel went silent. After testing it on multiple machines, I found that I could get the sound in the left ear to reappear momentarily if I jiggled the cord just right. It was obviously a poor connection somewhere inside the left ear, which apparently had worked its way loose despite the fact that the headset wasn't abused physically in any way.This sort of poor quality is not something I expect after paying almost $100. Look elsewhere if you want a USB headset that you intend to use for any length of time."
3,It works but hurts my ears,This headset works as other have recommended. But I find the cushions too small to cover the ear completely and press into them. I use it to make calls with Skype. I had to take it off my head after every call. I would choose another headset if I had to do it over again due to the comfort issue. I can't imagine playing game with this. Aside from that everything else works great.
3,"Logitech Premium USB Headset 350-good sound, but hot & uncomfortable","I've only used the Logitech Premium USB Headset 350 for internet voice and video chat. It has good good voice sound quality in the headset and people on the other end say my voice quality is good, so the microphone must work well. However, the large, vinyl padded ear pads make my ears feel very warm if I use it for an extended conversation. Also, since it is not an ultra lightweight headset, it gets a little uncomfortabel from the weight and the snugness on my ears (maybe snugger for me than some people because I wear a large hat size). I would prefer a headset with foam ear pads, but I suppose the vinyl pads block outside noises from the room better. I would also consider next time buying a lighter weight headset with only 1 earpiece, instead of 2 earpieces. This model seems to be built solidly with good construction, though."
3,Quality sound...a few minor inconveniences,"I really like the quality of the sound and the product overall. However, the cord is shorter than I like. Also, I found the mute button on the cord is triggered too easily. Using it for VOIP, I am often on/off mute when I don't know it (I've sometimes hung up on a call thinking my VOIP isn't working because noone hears me...turns out I bumped the mute button without knowing it)."
3,Too uncomfortable to wear - returning,"These headphones do what they advertise and for the money it's hard to beat - in terms of noise reduction they compare with headphones twice the price. I purchased these for use with Skype, and they worked flawlessly.Unfortunately, the designers obviously spent so much time perfecting the electronics that they never wore the bloody things, which are so uncomfortable that I took them off within moments of putting them on. I tried and tried to get used to them (because I'm cheap, and other headsets in this price range have horrible echo, and poor sound quality). Alas, the onslaught proved too much and I had to return them after a day of attempted use.If you wear glasses you will have to take them off, they press so hard on your ears."
3,"Started out great, but...","This was recommended to me from someone I play online games with. It has been a great headset as far as the sound goes until the last few months. Some people have talked about losing sound, well my problem is that there is loose wiring somewhere that causes static. The only way for me not to have static (or for the people I'm talking to not hear the static) is if I don't move. At all.It's unfortunate, because the sound quality is tremendous. Voices come across crisply, the noise-cancellation works wonders, and the people I'm talking to can hear me perfectly and it doesn't sound like I'm in a tunnel.My other complaint is one of comfort. The earphones crush my ears. I've put up with it for the last year because the sound quality is so good and I spent a lot of money on it. But, now that I have to replace the headset, I won't be buying another one of these."
2,"Good technology, poor design","Technically, these are good headphones. The sound quality is nice, although the bass is perhaps just a little strong. Microphone comes through clear and works very well.Setup is very easy; doesn't require any drivers or anything of the sort. The only thing you might have to do is disable the mic output in your volume control panel, to avoid hearing yourself in the headphones.Unfortunately the comfort is really a problem. Most overhead headphones have oval earpieces that fit over the ears. These have round earpieces that end up not fitting over your ears. The result is that the edges of your ears are pressed up against your head, making them quite painful to wear for more than half an hour or so."
3,Had to fix it myself but works fine now,"It was not working when I took it out of the box, the microphone didn't work at all and the sound was really erratic. I figured out it was a problem inside the in-line volume control thing. I really didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back and waiting weeks so I took it apart and found some wires had broke off the contacts on the circuit board(or were never connected in the first place). I soldered them back on and put everything back together. Since then It has been working great for the 2 months that I have had it. If it would have worked right from the beginning I would give this a better rating."
4,Great headset,"Great headset, the only problem is that the clip on the volume control tends to be a little awkward and fall off of wherever you clip it and fall so that the mute button gets hit."
2,Great Until it Breaks,"I bought this headset to use with Skype, and for that purpose, it was alright, except that the controls on the wire are very poorly designed. It's very easy to put yourself on mute and not realize it. (I've had people hang up on me a few times because of this.) The volume controls are also on a hair trigger, meaning that my system volume will go up to max or down to zero almost randomly.It only lasted a few months before becoming unusable after long and gradual decline in audio range and quality. However, it's not hard to fix if you're so inclined.I ripped mine open to find a really shoddy soldering job, and with some tape and cheap fixing, it works enough until I can afford a new headset, but it's still on its last legs.If you purchase this item, pay attention to any deterioration in audio, so that you can return it if yours starts dying like mine did."
2,"Bulky, but good sound quality","I'm using this with a Lenovo T42 laptop and mostly for Skype. The installation was a breeze, I just plugged them in and it worked. The sound quality is very good. But, they are very bulky headphones and are uncomfortable for long-term wear. I wouldn't recommend them."
1,BROKEN - UNCOMFORTABLE - POOR QUALITY - AVOID,"Now, the volume slides down to zero as soon as it is plugged in. I can watch the volume bar slide down - if I quickly unplug it the volume stops dropping.I called Logitech and they diagnosed it as broken. They said a defective dongle is the culprit and of course it is out of warranty.Quality control is lacking.This headset was very uncomfortable and squeezed my ears too tight. AVOID"
3,"They're ok, but they just broke","This is a decent low-budget headset (don't pay more than $30 for it). The mic works great, never had a problem with people not hearing me or anything ... that is until about a year after I got them. Suddenly the speakers just fizzled out. Literally. I was listening to something and then it just slowly fizzled out. Just a couple days after that the mic stopped working, too. The light was still on and everything seemed ok, but I couldn't hear anything and it wasn't recording any sound. That was really disappointing since I like Logitech, but these just stopped working all of a sudden. It happened after I started plugging it in into my G15 keyboard ironically enough."
1,Ultimately Garbage,"Sound quality was fine for as long as they worked but you may find the fit very tight and uncomfortable unless you have a small head. There is no adjustment for this. They started cutting out and one day, they just quit for no apparent reason and now can't be detected in either Mac or PC. Total waste of money and to even speak to a Logitech rep would cost me $16! I won't go with Logitech again. You get what you pay for and these are garbage. Save your money and get something that will work properly."
2,Do not buy!,"This headset isnt worth the 70$ i purshased them and after a few months of use i started loosing sound from either side one i moved the cable, until the left side failed completely, i kept using them then the mic cable also failed not being able to use the mic and hearing from one side i through them away, my friend also had these and they broke on him too, really bad quality product..."
2,Poor design and very painfull to wear,"When I first started using this headset I was impressed, Sleek overall apperrence nice volume/mute control, and great overall sound quality. But unfortunatly thats where it stoped (at least for me). I am a avid gamer so the headphones are alomost in constant use and I run a lan center so they get moved around alot. These headsets are also very uncomftorable after say 4-5 hours of use they put alot of pressure on your ears as they are a pretty tight fit. but comfort issues aside; after about a month the small rubber connections on bolth sides of the volume control began to seperate exposing the wires. Then the sound began to drop out intermitantly on bolth sides almost randomly. Then the Mic stoped working alltogether. It turned out that the connection inside the volume/mut control had become broken. I imagine that if you are not constantly using this headset it would be great. But if your going to be using it constantly I would look at other options."
2,"Good quality, incredibly uncomfortable","The headphones give great sound, and the microphone works well, even though I typically have a quiet voice. However, the headphones are so tight and so poorly padded that I cannot wear them for five minutes at a time without pain, and longer leaves ugly welts on my ears. It may work better for someone with a smaller head, but the headset is poorly designed for comfort."
3,Microphone not worth anything!,The headphone component in fully functional. The volume controls are somewhat intuitive.The microphone is not worth much. I had to yell to get the volume that was required to do a voice over on my video editing software.
2,USB Ports stop working,"Yep I agree with many other reviewers about how uncomfortable the headset is. It doesn't take long and my ears really start to ache from wearing them.I also agree that the mute button is in a lousy location. I either accidently mute it or hit the volume control so that what I am listening to is booming or quiet.The most annoying thing, however, is the fact that for no apparent reason that I can find the USB Port that the headset is plugged into will suddenly stop working, forcing you to replug into another port. I have had this happen on 2 different computers and have a few ports that no longer work."
3,"Good Sound, kind of tight","I like the Sound quality alot,good for gaming since i use itto shout commands at people whileplaying CS:S, also good for skypesince i use to make calls to my friends.The problem i had with it was it was KIND oftight, and i did buy it after reading some reviewssaying it is tight, i tried to break them in kind ofand it did loose a bit(be warned others who tried some hadbroken it)Over all, good headset for the price, and I do recommendbreaking them in a lil bit before initial use(not too hard thosince you will break it)"
3,Mic not long enough,I had to return this unit because the mic arm was too short and people were having issues hearing me clearly. I ended up going wit the Plantronics DSP-500 and it works like a champ.
4,Great Headset,I use this head set in Iraq to call my wife. This head set has wonderful sound quality and is very comfortable. We generaly have long conversations over the internet. The quality and function of this head set makes it a great value.
2,Great microphone... but your ears will not forgive you,"Fully functional headset with a good microphone for World of Warcraft, but very uncomfortable to wear for extended time.I gave this set a try, but my ears will not forgive me. I hope for more headset models in the future with studio-style earphones that cover the whole ear.Pity that such a great microphone was coupled with uncomfortable design."
1,Never again.,"So my last headset was Logitech and it was the most painful thing I had ever purchased, it also only lasted a couple of months. I gave Logitech another chance and I bought this headset.At first, they were ok but in just four weeks the wire started to twist just like the old pair I use to have which was a different model, it twisted to the point where the microphone got a lot of static and people couldn't hear me anymore.These are also uncomfortable if you use them for long periods of time, not that much but it does hurt after awhile.The sound quality wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. It was decent.I really did try giving Logitech a 2nd chance but with this model but it has really made me never want to purchase a product from them again. These headsets don't last and are expensive.That was just my experience with it."
4,Good headset,It was sort of strange at first not hearing yourself in the headset. You got over it after a while. Over all the headset is really good. The sound quality is good and from what I hear the microphone quality is also good. The only problem is there is this button that you can accidentally press to make you go on mute. If they cant hear you check to see if its blinking. If it is then press it. you will be good to go. Overall a good product.
1,Complete Junk,"What can I say.... I'm a glutten for punishment.I have bought 4 of the USB Premium 350 headsets... every one of them has failed, the last one within about two weeks. Save your money and look elsewhere"
4,Good headphones,"These headphones were recommended to me by a friend who uses them all the time. I really like them and though they are a little hard on the ears after a while, I think they are great. I recorded my first podcast and the sound was great. I would definitely recommend them.Paul GenesseAuthor of The Dragon Hunters[...]"
2,"Works well, but hurts my ears","The sound is good and it's easy to use, but this headset hurts my ears and the top of my head and I've tried a bunch of different adjustments. I can't wear my glasses with it at all."
1,Microphone broke after less than a month,"I usually just wear headsets around my neck and run sound through different speakers, and that way I just can use the mic while gaming. When I put it on my ears though, the band didn't adjust comfortably, and it was like my head was in a vice. The big volume control thing in the middle of the cord - worst design idea ever - please people, stop designing them like that. It had a dead spot in the volume wheel if you turn it to the right spot. The mic mute slider on it also was very easy to turn off. I could've lived with all of that, and it would have been ok for $30, but after a month the mic stops working - the only reason I needed a headset, and it's dead.Conclusion - bad design, uncomfortable, and very cheaply built."
2,Uncomfortable and Poort Quality,Purchased back in December 2006. By June 2007 they had broken. I only get sound out of one side of the headset unless the cable is jiggled the right way.On top of that they are extremely uncomfortable. Pads are not soft foam but rather a hard faux leather. Also not a good fit for people who wear glasses as the headset will push against your ears and make your glasses dig into the back of your ear.
3,The most uncomfortable headset that I have ever worn.,"The headset works well and the USB connection is certainly convenient. Basically, this headset works exactly as advertised and I would give it five stars if it were not for the comfort issue. I wish that I had not ignored the reviewers who complained about the comfort of the headset. The first time that I put on the headset, I felt the hard, plastic strap press uncomfortably on the top of my head. I wear headphones to listen to music all of the time, but none of the headphones that I have ever owned come close to the discomfort that the Logitech 350 causes. Some people find the discomfort to go away with use. I hope that this is the case.If comfort is not an issue for you, then definitely get this headset. But, if you plan to use the headset for long periods of time, you most certainly want to look at other products."
4,Adequate,"I wanted to use this for skype without interfering with my audio set up since it uses USB.The ear muffs are firm and not very comfortable but it doesn't bother me with long chats. It just could be softer. Sound quality was fine and the person on the other end can here me fine also.Now for the bad news, the usb cable plug was bad so if I move it around any it loses connection with the computer. I figure someday I'll end up splicing a new cable on the end of it."
3,Great Headphones but hurt like hell!,"I really like the products logitech has but for some reason these headphones start to really hurt my ear after extended periods of time on my head. By extended I mean an hour or so and if you take them off, they hurt your ears really badly. The longer they stay on your head the more painful it will be when you take them off. I also know it's not my fault because my ears are not too big or too small and I adjusted the settings of width on them and they still hurt. Don't get me wrong the quality of the mic and music is great but I just hate to wear them because they are so painful."
5,Best for Skype,I have been using these head sets for 2 years and they are the best. They block the noise and are very comfortable.
3,Good value,"Good quality on sound and microphone. It's annoying that you have to ask skype to recognize it when you plug in unless you restart skype, it's tight on me (but headphones always are), and the mute button is way too easy to press during normal conversation. Still, it gets the job done and I use it all the time."
3,The mute button seems exceptionally sensitive.,"The headset has fine audio quality and very good sensitivity, but the mute button is very easy to trigger accidentally. It's frustrating to talk for a minute only to realize you've muted yourself... again... by the mute button simply bumping against you."
4,"Great sound & MIC, but torture on ears for comfort","I bought these because I had trouble getting my sound card to work with a headset with mic. Very ease install, just plug it in. Great stereo sound, easy to operate. But the cons start when you put the headset on. I wear glasses, continous bifocals, so putting them over the headset is not an option since I then cannot see. Presses on ears and can cause a headache after extended use. If Logitech had used larger pads on the earphones that might ease the discomfort. Will pay more attention to the reviews in the future. I bought this model because a fellow gamer was raving about them, bad buy on my part for me."
2,Modern torture device,"These things are HORRIBLY uncomfortable. I've taken to wrapping them around my computer chasis (~10"" wide) during the day to help ""break them in."" It helps somewhat, but after a few hours I'm back in pain.The mic works great. Sound is fine.The mute button light stopped working, and won't come back on. I have two headsets experiencing this problem now. It's quite annoying, as it's easy enough to hit accidently and you'll spend the next ten minutes wondering why no one responds to you. Lame.IMO, these things are little more than a torture device."
3,"excelent audio, not an easy to use piece of hardware","I got this hoping that it would give me the freedom of plug it in, and stop hearing from my speakers and start listening from the headset, instead, i have to reboot every time i want to use one or another.the audio is clean, the usability (volume up/down, mic on/off) is cool, all but the problem of the sound that i need to reboot if i want to use the headset or my speaker system."
4,As promised,"All the reviews I read on this product suggested that this was the best value and most comfortable. I have had the set for a month and so far the headphones have lived up to their promise. Personally, I do not like to spend a lot of these kind of items since they have a habit of breaking after a while. This ceratainly seemd to be the case from the reviews that I read of the cheaper products."
1,Bad design,The USB plug on this head set sticks out enough to assure you will break it within 6 months and have to throw them away after turning you head accidentally yanking the connection. I then got wireless - and then one side went out on those.
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I have bought many reusable sticker books for my daughter (a huge Strawberry Shortcake fan), so I thought this would give many enjoyable hours of playtime! WRONG!! The reusable stickers stick to the dolls OK, but when you try to put them back on the page they came from, they don't stick well at all!! So you end up with pages of bent and mangled stickers. The opposite happens when you try to use the reusable stickers on top of the cutout clothing! They stick so well that they tear off the surface of the cutout clothes!! I just wish once someone at the company that makes them would actually sit down and try to use them!! HORRID!! Try one of the ""Sticker Stories"" books instead!!"
5,versatility in a carry strap,"I use a telephoto lens for birding. Longer lenses have their own tripod mount, and that is where I attach the carrying strap. If I want to switch to a much shorter lenses I lose that lens mount for the strap and I never like to have my fancy camera strapless. These add on straps with quick buckles allow me to quickly switch the carry strap to the camera body. It's the kind of solution I would want to invent if it didn't exist."
1,extensions,"Op/Tech System Connectors, Pro Loop - 14"" Webbing (9 - 12"" Each side)did not extend the strap at all, same as the ones that came with the strap"
5,don't know the remixes but...,I know the song and it's great. One of the best songs I've heard in a while.
3,"Where's the advice for the ""Common Man""?","I like Orman a lot on her TV show, but this book helped me very little, and that was disappointing. Plenty of advice for those who have stocks or other investments or homes they can use to get out of debt, but little practical advice for those of us who have no investments and no real estate. I make less than $40,000 per year, with no investments to fall back on, no home to re-finance...I rent and live paycheck to paycheck with what might be seen as a small amount of debt, but I'm still drowning. The only practical advice I got from this was: Spend Less. Well duh. I suppose I should have spent less by not buying this book."
5,Girlfriend liked it,"Was looking for the flashy bling. This is not diamond, but its all sparkly. Girlfriend liked it."
1,Breaks on tough nails,"I'll grant that my dog has very tough nails, but this is not a product that is built to last. I have been through three of these - they keep breaking. Get one of the scissor-style nail clippers. There are plenty of choices on Amazon."
1,Sure cure for insomnia,"Rarely have I come across such a horribly boring, tedious book. The writer attempts to impress us with her pompous vocabulary and totally decimates a promising subject. A difficult and painful read."
4,Que has done it again,"Now this book has 1,056 pages of study material, practice exams, and the how to apply your knowledge with step by step instructions: What else could anyone ask for? Now I would suggest a year of experience and or knowledge of DNS and domain administration to help fill in a few gaps. But overall, Que has done it again...set the bar at a higher level."
4,wow.,"i can't believe this is out on cd. i just stumbled across it today! my late husband and i had this on tape years and years ago. absolutely my favorite dead/jerry related show. but the one we had.. had masterpiece, dear prudence and russian lullaby on it. it's really too bad they didn't include those with this release and it's the reason i'm giving it four stars. i did however find the complete version at the jerry garcia store. the extra disc is included free and has the late show.. entitled ""way after midnight."""
5,"Let's Call a Spade a Spade, Jerry WAS The Grateful Dead","The Jerry Garcia Band is just that... all about Jerry. This show is all about Jerry. I consider myself a deadhead, but given the choice to see JGB or The Grateful Dead, the Jerry band wins EVERY TIME without question. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the Dead, but Jerry was EVERYTHING that made the Dead so darn great, without the cheesy filler that is Bob Weir. JGB is the BEST way to enjoy the beautiful gift that Jerry shared with us all, and this show is ONE GENEROUS GIFT! If you like the DEAD you will LOVE JGB, and this is a great jumping off point for all of you deadheads who have never seen or heard JGB.You owe it to yourself to get this Show. Buy it NOW!"
5,Nice jammin',"I bought this based on how I liked another JGB cd (welcome to our world) and am pleased with the sounds on this one. Garcia shows his genius on these extended jams. I get an upbeat feeling while listening to this music. Even the synthesizer music, which is corny in the context of current synthetic sounds, adds to the groove. All three discs are great, especially if you are looking for some great guitar jamming sounds. If you like this one, I encourage you to take a look at the JGB's ""Welcome to our world""."
3,The Jerry Garcia Band .....Mostly for Dead Heads...,"Listen ..Lets be Objective and stop the Idol Worship..Most of us are accustomed to listening to The Dead and are indoctrinatedto Jerry's playing and appreciate the nuances of his fine playing..But this is not dynamic music. The Keyboard playing is weak and the drummer has no snap to his playing..The average person who is not a Dead fan might even find this recording..I hate to say it ....boring..But that being told Jerry's guitar playing here is fine and crisp ,his old pal John Kahn's Bass playing is on Jerry's level.. I miss the Outstanding Ladies backing Jerry up on later recordings adding a great dynamic to the songs.If you are a dead fan by all means get this recording and enjoy. If you are not a Dead fan and have a open mind take a listen to a Fine guitarist stetching out with some new players other than the Dead."
5,heavy album,"Hellbound by Warlock is their heaviest album to date. And as a metal connisuer i know what good 80's metal is! not faster pussycat thats not metal! if you want some hard hitting metal buy this record this is the second album by Warlock and lead singer Doro pesch is really on in this one if you want to know more about warlock see my review on triumph and agony. doro pesch is the queen of metal not lita ford! although lita is a good artist. doro has kept it metal after warlock split up in the late 80's her first solo album was force majuer or something like that i havent bought it yet but its on my list. and shes still going strong, not to mention she in her mid to late 40's. I love metal and if you love metal you'll love this album."
2,Warlock's weakest album,"That I usually associate this album as the filler in between Burning the Witches and True as Steel underscores its limited appeal. Altogether, it is an inferior continuation of the first album, crispier in production (which is common with most band's second album) but still weakened by the general song uniformity. Earthshaker Rock and the title cut are decent songs, but the second side is largely forgettable. Overall, the album's most memorable element is that some songs feature a lengthy solo (or more accurately two, as there are two guitarists) after the second chorus with no vocal following."
5,Squirrels,This informative nature book describes all kinds of squirrels and their relatives in an interesting story that children will enjoy!
2,By the book metal,"A completely cookie-cutter, paint-by-numbers metal album. I hear absolutely nothing new or interesting here. This isn't the metal you're looking for. You can go about your business. Move along."
4,comedy central's stand up picks part 3,I enjoy listening to comedy without all the profanity. It was just as funny with the curse words beeped out. A great mixture of humor!
4,Engaging and accessible,"A wonderful tour of the early Roman empire framed within a rigorous theoretical discussion. Zanker skillfully illustrates how an empire was built by the manipulation of public thought through the use of images, or in other words, propaganda. Shapiro contributes with a lively and nearly transparent translation."
5,there should be more from Casual Dots,"catchy stuff. There's about 4 on here that are some of my favorite songs of all time. I love Hooded and She's the Real Thing. Buy this record if you are into punk rock, girl groups, instrumentals, et al."
1,Memorex = Coasters,I can't begin to explain how inconsistent Memorex discs are; from manufacturing to the PIE & PIF to material they use for print tops. It's not worth the money. Go with a Taiyo Yuden product and save yourself the hassle and frustration.
3,Woops,"My shipment arrived with the spindle package broken(the spindle was broken totally off its base.) This was result of improper packaging and not the fault of the carrier. I was given a 20% discount to smooth my ruffled feathers. Fortunately I had an extra spindle and used that to replace the broken one that I had received. Without that, I would have been SOL. There's NO excuse for the way this was packaged. However,the media seems to be OK thus far."
1,This Product does not work with my both my memorex drive waste of money and since I cant return dvds im screwed,"I just got these dvd's today and none of them work I have 2 memorex dvd drive witl the firmwere up to date a 2.4 and 16X and the 2.4 burn error and the 16x burns, but the disk never reads I have tryed all speed be got no results I already wasted 5 out of 100 dvdr and I know none of them will work."
4,No coasters and they print great!,"After burning about 50 DVD's, I have no coasters. The surface prints just beautifully. I use a Epson R-320 printer and the results of this printer and the Memorex DVD's are great.I ordered this twice. Once I was sent the hub printable version and the other has a narrow strip at the hub that you can print with a gap where the stacking ring is. At first, I was disappointed, but after using both I find them both to be very useful.The only negative is that Amazon should specify which printable type you are going to get rather than leaving it up to chance."
3,Why fix it?,"I used this brand of recordable Dvds and I couldn't found it anymore, so I searched in the internet and I ordered it thinking it was full face printable like the ones I bought before, but they have a ring wich does not allow to print full face. I don't know what's the idea about his design, but I didn't like it."
1,..and oldie does not mean goldie every time.,"A manipulative girl and a spine-less man. She should have been used as a prototype for some major attack vehicle (the attitude, not the size) and he would have done well as a bathroom towel - soft and pliable and one can fold it any way one wants. Terribly afraid of dark stains, though. She decides first that she wants his bed (without him in it) and then him (with the bed). He does not decide anything.I suppose one of the main reasons why Olivier became such a fantastic Shakespear actor was that he understood that otherwise he would have had to play in more stupid movies like that one. That was a very wise decision."
4,Great fun!,"I have watched this movie three times. It never fails to make me laugh, and brighten my mood. True it is not a thought provoking plot, but if you want to sit back relax, and laugh this is the movie to watch. I had to buy it because I enjoy it so much."
3,be aware is CDR and company logo is visible on screen throughout film,"Be aware that this is a CDR with the purple colored back DVD disc. Also be aware, the company LOGO appears on the screen throughout the entire feature film, like you see on cable TV, with any number of stations who practice this same thing. It is very annoying to PURCHASE a video with this where you'd hope to escape obnoxious commercialism. Anyway, this copy does have a good recorded quality so that is fine. Also, at this time, no one else is making this really nice movie on DVD that is better. Although to settle for this version is the option, You now know as it is not stated in the ad, it is CDR, and you must contend with that very annoying company stamp logo on the screen throughout the picture."
2,Guess you had to be there...,"Fans of Raimundo Fagner, a pop idol in the Brazilian Northeast, may like this, but for most listeners outside of Brazil, I doubt this florid pop album has much to offer. This record originally came out in 1979, and features arrangements by Joao Donato, who also plays on piano."
1,Oregon Scientific Blood Pressure Monitor,The reading are inaccurate. I've checked them against a calibrated sphygmomanometer and the reading aren't even close. I cannot reccommend this product.
2,I am probably their only fan,"This album is a remix collection of their first album ""Regenerate"". It is remixed by some of the biggest names in Electronica and Industrial. The problem is that all the Mixers have chosen the loudest screechiest parts to put into constant loop on almost every track. Good back ground music, I don't recomend it for dancing, cruising or listening. Buy ""Regenerate"" Instead."
5,The most relaxing music I have ever heard.,"This is the best CD of all time. When I first listened to it, I just couldn't stop. It helps me relax and calm down whenever I'm in a bad mood or whenever I am just plain board. This CD has the most mellowing and soothing soundtracks, with drum beats to the sound's of the oceans waves clashing. If you love new age music, then you will love this CD"
5,A great stress-reliever!,"This soothing music is perfect for any time of the day...to take you away to a ""kindler, gentler"" place. After reading another review on this CD, decided to try it...and am so glad I did! Some very beautiful melodies...a few with ""Enya-like"" background harmonies...and just a subtle touch of nature sounds in just the right places.The melodies on this CD were composed in part by Diane Arkenstone (David's wife)."
5,"Wild Asia, Indeed!","If you're into wildlife videos run - don't walk - to your video store for this one. There are many excellent videos on the Serengeti from National Geographic alone, and there is no one end-all classic in that area. Not so for Kipling country. This video is the definitive chronicle of the tiger and those who must live in it's shadow. Two sequences - one of a tiger taking down a sambar deer in water as the whole forest seems to take up a collective warning cry and the other of a tiger walking along the roof edge of an ancient temple - are alone worth the price. Absolutely magical. This is one for posterity to be watched over and over again."
1,This is CRAP.,"Yanno, these whack ass remixes F#$*in SUK!! If you're down too you'll know what im talkin about. JUGGALOS FOR LIFE!! WOOP WOOP. MMFWCL to those thats down wit meh."
1,Cock ka,Are u f'n serious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This cd is junk.F**k You you denmark F#*K!!!!!!!WHOOP WHOOP!!!!!!WICKED CLOWNS WILL NEVER DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!
1,GAY!!,"Oh my god, this is so ridiculous...I listened to the first 6 or 7 samples and this nothing but pure, genuine, state of the art...HORSE SH**! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!! And if you DO decide to buy it, then go ahead and waste your money because you deserve to for being so stupid as to buy it. Does that make sense? Maybe. Oh well F*^# it. Bottom line...this cd is gay"
1,Utterly worthless,"I bought this map to aid navigation during a visit to western England. The British use roundabouts rather than stop lights. There are diagrams at the approach to each roundabout that indicate the direction of each road leading off the roundabout and lists the towns each road leads to. The signs do not always list the cities - only the villages and towns. This map shows only the very largest towns. We spent two days of total frustration and wasted time before we threw the map in the trash and bought a local map. If you plan to drive around Great Britain, I would recommend waiting until you get to England and then buying a local map at a petrol station along the motorway."
5,"Yes sir, yes sir a nickel bag full...","Amazing from start to finsih. One of the most essential P-Funkalbums. And although not the only classic in their catalog 'Flashligt'is definately essential. (And ahhh...that ain't Bootsy baby, that bassline is Bernie on keys, but check out Bootsy's brother Catfish onrhytm guitar). However to say that the lyrics are meaningless is waywrong. Although the lyrics may seem silly, the messages in P-Funkwere as subtle as the puns were blatant. But the social points arewell laid. 'Endangered Species' is just as much about race as it isabout booty shakin'. One of the essential P-Funk ideas was freedomfrom the need to be free. Also note that these are not samples, thisis where samples come from. ... There is nothing lackluster on thisalbum. Every song is a funk explosion and the two ballads 'Wizard ofFinance' and 'Placebo Syndrome' are a nice call back to their doo-wopdays. Add this to your collection and you won't be disapointed."
5,trop fort !,"J'écoute cet album tout le temps, tous les jours, toutes les nuits, en permanence. Ce n'est peut-tre pas une bonne raison pour que vous l'achetiez mais a vous montre à quel point cette musique peut vous posséder! Funketelechyment votre, Alain."
4,Has anybody seen Sir Nose D'Void O' Funk?,"Coming off the super successful P-Funk Earth tour, Parliament was primed for hitsville. This is Parliament at its' commercial peak in 1978. Contains the mega-hit single ""Flashlight"" and the minor hit single ""Bop Gun"". Funkentelechy was written to be a commercial success and is, therefore, not as clever or experimental as the ""Mothership Connection"" or the ""Clones of Dr. Funkenstein."" Most songs tend to rely heavily on more of a disco dance beat -- which was all-too-popular in 1978. But, as dance albums go, this was still far better than anything else at the time. Perhaps not a ""classic"" album, but still great. -- Highly recommended!"
5,P-F unk Live Aftermath !,"I was sixteen years old and after hearing parliment/funkadelic [tear da roof off,undisco kidd,and dr funknstein on da radio,I knew that this band was'nt the average band. And the visual effects of a funkadelic album at dat time was out of dis world.Then I was cloned when I was tookn hostage by da p-funk earth tour album[and i was buzz-up too!] I knew then that the next album had to be a portall to the next time.I've seen parliment/funkadelic in chicago '79' funkfest. it was a good concert,but it could of been great with bootsy there and maybe under 90 degrees it was hot.The funkentelechy album is truly the last p-funk album before parliment/funkadelic disbanded.Peace to Glen Goins and Eddie Hazel."
5,Epitome of Hard-Hitting Funk,"""Funkentelechy vs. The Placebo Syndrome"" is the ultimate anti-disco album, and is the most prolific P-Funk work, next to ""Mothership Connection"". From ""Bop Gun""'s infectious bass playing by Bootsy Collins to the revolutionary bass-synth of Bernie Worrell on ""Flashlight"", this album screams ""classic"". For the record, this album is not disco-funk. Disco copied the hard-hitting elements of the funk form, and over-simplified and computerized it. If this album contains ""disco""-like attributes, it should be read as a funk attribute."
5,Noone knows where the Nose goes,"This album is needed in America now more than ever. With the conservative takeover we funkateers need some help to escape the zone of zero-funkativity, and this album can do it. Describing the ongoing conflict between Starchild and Sir Nose, the one who wants the party to start and the one who wants the party to end, ""Funkentelechy"" is it. This also, is the essence of Parliament. Wierd subject matter, awesome jams and the baddest grooves to get down to, there is nothing not to like here. Although Sir Nose lost in ""Flashlight"" he didn't leave, only hid out for awhile, but now he's back, so buy this album, put on your sunglasses, pull out yo bop-gun, and we shall overcome."
