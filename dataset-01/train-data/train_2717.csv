4,very nice come-along,"very nice, the single hook is a little smaller then I would like, but it works very well. You have to reach in and move the spring over for the release trip, instead of a leaver, not bad just different."
2,Disappointed,"Purchased this 5 ton to replace a 4 ton a had for over 15 years. Big mistake. No way would this unit ever have a list price of $99 as indicated. Definitely not worth the $40 plus I paid. The plastic handle came off the first time I tried to use it. The wire cable already had a broken strand. Really poor quality unit. I would never classify this as ""Heavy duty"". Stay away from this product."
5,Transcendent,"The way I hear these compositions is probably colored by the reading of Gurdjieff and Fourth Way literature. But from a purely musical point of view I believe these are close to masterpiece level works. Some short and deceptively simple, some longer and intricate, in all cases they do seem to be a window into a time and place where art and spirituality were inextricably interwoven. Dr. Lytle's performances are dignified, precise and lyrical. Among the thousands of recordings I have owned and heard there are three I never seem to tire of hearing; this set, ""Thursday Afternoon"" by Brian Eno, and ""Music for Zen Meditation"" by Tony Scott."
1,Too Expensive,"I'm a fitness swimmer and hoped this could help me with shoulder problems I am having. While the content is helpful and probably correct, there is actually very little content! I usually don't blink at the price of any book or video, but this would be better priced at [PRICE] rather than [PRICE]."
3,twinings tea,"this is okay. i've always wanted to try tea leaves and thought thiswas a great deal since prince of wales tea is my favorite. i found this only okay. the tea is very powdery so when i'm making tea i see to get small leaves in my tea all the time. when i got tea leaves at a store they were much better. i was glad i tried this, it is stronger than bag tea like everyone says, but overall it is messier and not worth the extra effort"
2,too expensive,"I was misled by the size of the vehicle as compared to the price. This item is sold in department stores for less than 10.00. I feel I was overcharged as My price for set a and b was over 60.00. with shipping. i won't be fooled again. Be warned this is not a Megazord sized toy, and certainly should not be priced as one."
5,Rock-solid textbook for non-math majors,"I used this book for my MBA statistics class recently. This book is very well written in a clear way, not meant to be fancy but to provide a comprehensive coverage of most, if not all, relevant topics. I also belive that the coverage depth of each topic is adequate enough to satisfy all common business and economics applications."
1,Definitely leaf through it before deciding to buy,"I'm an MBA student in a top5 business school in the US, and we use this as our textbook for the basic stats course. I've only read the first 5 chapters so far, and I've found this book to be one of the worst textbooks I've seen since college. Some very simple concepts are explained in very confused (and confusing) language, the text is very arid and skips over most of the conceptual subtleties or fallacies that the unsuspecting user of statistical data may easily fall victim to. I strongly suggest leafing through it before deciding whether to buy it (you can start with chapter 2, which is pretty typical of the tone of the book and, being the 1st ""substantial"" chapter of the book, doesn't assume knowledge of concepts defined in previous chapters)."
4,"Lower cost, little difference","So two things for buyers: The 6th edition is out and your professor likely is trying to get you to buy that one. Second even if the condition is marked as new by a seller on v5, most books are missing the CD-Rom when it reaches here. I haven't found a need for this disk, but the mislabeling by vendors is ANNOYING! The book isn't too bad and has little difference to the 6th edition (the 6th divides the chapters and concepts more), good class notes and a good list of formulas can help greatly. For the formulas Google for ""CBS Semester 1 David Juran Statistics"" if you can. I also would tell faculty to forget the added costs of v6 and the insanity of special print additions as this book used is plentiful, cheap and has really nothing horribly wrong. You know, use statistics and economics to figure out what is better for students?"
3,Embarrassing!,CD supplement to this edition is virtually impossible to use due to chaotic labelling.I have being looking forward to some useful data to be found in the CD but could not find absolutely nothing. Very disappointing I say!!!
3,Shellhead gets Disassembled,"With Brian Michael Bendis disassembling the Avengers, Mike Oeming killing Thor, and Robert Kirkman wreaking havoc on Captain America, Mark Ricketts got the assignment to disassemble Iron Man. Taking place after Tony Stark's tirade at the United Nations, Tony finds himself accused of murder after someone wearing Iron Man armor murders his board of directors. Eventually, it becomes clear that someone has got their hands on Tony's technology, culminating in a showdown between Iron Man and the murderer. Out of all the Disassembled storylines, this is probably the weakest. Ricketts' storytelling doesn't go anywhere, and the art by Scott Kolins is really nothing to write home about. The epilogue sets the stage for the Iron Man relaunch (yes, he's getting relaunched yet again) under the helm of Transmetropolitan and Hellblazer scribe Warren Ellis (and trust me, it's real, real good). Iron Man Disassembled isn't bad though, and it is worth a look at least."
3,The Most Annoying Toy In The World,"My kids love this thing. Particularly my 3 year old son who is an aspiring rock star. His sister, for whom it was purchased, only uses it occasionally.I HATE this thing. It is the most annoying sounding toy to have ever been in our house. It's grating, loud, repetative, etc. It makes me want to poke out my ear drums. When the kids are using it my husband and I make faces of agony, illness, and death across the room at each other. It is truly that annoying.The guitar has handled quite a few drops so it's not as though the quality is terrible. However, I kind of wish it would suffer a fatal blow so that we can get rid of it. We do everything we can to keep it out of sight and out of mind. The headset is worthless and doesn't stay on.Buy it if you dare."
5,great toy for kids,this guitar is very intertaining for my grandaughter she loves it the place i bought it sends it out very quickly
3,The songs are not age appropriate for the toy,"My daughter's grandfather bought this guitar for her. He only looks at the ""For ages 4+"" part, so he thought it was a good choice. I think it's a cute toy, although it has no real redeeming qualities. But it's fun and a kick to watch her pretend with it. But I do have a problem with the song selections, with lyrics like ""I'm not that innocent"" from Brittney Spears and ""I look but I don't touch""!! I don't really think it's approriate for 4 year olds, and as one other reviewer stated, by the time girls are 7 it's a boring toy. Not that those songs are for 7 year olds either. So, I'm a bit disappointed and frustrated that I am going to have to deal with her frustration when I get rid of the song cards."
2,Not for kids over 5,"My niece really wanted one of these guitars because she loves to sing and loves Barbie; however, it is very boring for a 7 year old and really doesn't give them the option of ""really playing"" the guitar. Is great for small children, but not 5 or older."
5,Great Fun!,We originally purchased this for my 3 year old and it was such a hit that we had to buy another one for our 6 year old...they play with them constantly-love the Shania Twain song--we're big fans...wish there were more cartridges to put in it though. We bought it knowing this was one of the suggestions and we don't regret it one bit.We love the concerts that our girls put on for us!
1,Not for Three yr olds.,"My daughters grandmother got this for her for christmas. I hate it!! The songs are so not for this age group, so I returned it for a Tinkerbell dress up and a video, something much more enjoyable for myself and my daughter. I feel that close family should ask advice when they are buying gifts, so that they dont go out and buy them expense gifts that are just going to get returned, regifted or sitting in the closet for years! This toy is for 10 yr olds not 3."
3,my 2 granddaughters,i don't know much about this product. i only know that this toy is on the top of their list. it may be a pretent guitar but just being able to pertent to play and to sing will be enough for them.
1,Worked for about 5 minutes,"My daughter (7) saw this on TV and asked for it for Christmas, it's a cute idea and for the 5 minutes it worked it was great. No noise comes out of the headset anymore plus she was frustrated because the headset wouldn't stay on. Amazon is kindly taking it back and I will try something similar that doesn't involve a headset. Also, it doesn't say this anywhere in any of the product description, but ours came with two music cartidges for a total of 7 songs."
5,My daughter loves it!,"I agree with Ky from Kentucky. My daughter started saying she wanted it about the end of November and this is the ONLY thing she said she wanted! I went to Toysrus and they had several, so I didn't get one then mainly because I had my daughter with me. I went back about 2 weeks before Christmas to get it and there were none left. I saw one on toyrus.com and ordered it right away only to get an e-mail the Monday before Christmas that they were out of stock, so I got on the phone to every Toysrus within a 75 mile radius and not one store had any. I finally found one and it was the absolute last one at a Target. I have to say though it was worth all of the stress I went through to see her open that on Christmas and see her eyes light up and also see all of her ""shows"" that she puts on now!"
3,"Well, it doesn't even work!","There is nothing more disappointing to a child as when the toy they've been waiting for comes out of the box inoperable. The guitar arrived this morning (miraculous in itself since Amazon just got my order yesterday!), and it flat out does not work. The songs don't work and there is only an annoying ""ding"" when she hits any button. Also, the headset is made for maybe a 2 year old head (my 6 year old daughter can't wear it and therefor can't use that feature). The strap is useless because it pops off the hooks. So, regardless of the fact that it arrived broken, the headset and strap can't be used at all. Suddenly $40 seems steep for this toy!"
2,"The songs should fit the role model for a 4-7 year old - ""Not that innocent"" isn't a good choice with all of the child crime...","""Not that innoncent"" is not a good choice for a cute little 4-7 year old to be singing in this world of crime against children. There are so many great songs out there that would be better choices for our innocent little girls to sing. Could be a great toy, too bad I have to return it."
4,Make it stop,"Perfect gift when paired with ""The Barbie Diaries"" DVD. My 4 year old loves her guitar, especially ""I'm a survivor"" that plays over and over and over again. Ughhh! The headset doesn't fit on her little ears, and she has to basically eat the microphone to hear herself sing. She loves everything about it. Great gift to send to the Grandparents house for a visit. They will love you for it!..Not."
2,Not appropriate for age group,"My four year old daughter was really excited to get this toy for Christmas. Overall, it is not too bad of a toy although it can be a little loud when the volume gets turned up. The headset microphone is too small for my four year old and fall off a lot while she is using it. My main complaint with this is that the songs included with it are not approriate for four year olds. I cringe everytime my daughters says, ""Daddy, watch this, 'I'm not that innocent'."""
3,Enjoyable Read,"Wendy Holden entertains with her witty writing and, as I am a woman, I never feel so ""girly"" as I do when I read the tales of her heroines.This portrayal isn't as clever as some of Holden's other protagonists but the pages fly by."
3,Not her greatest,"I love Ms. Holdens work, especially ""Farm Fatale,"" but Gossip Hound was just not up to par. It had a slow start, very few twists and turns and a predictable ending.The only reason I'm giving the book 3 stars is out of loyatly."
3,Not My Favorite of Hers But Not Bad Either,"I like to read Holden's books when I have nothing pressing to do - which is once in a great while. Gossip Hound is o.k. It is kinda slow at first and the characters are somewhat frustrating. I found myself skimming ahead rather than savoring each word. Terribly predicatable. But if you have read her other books, and I recommend you do to kick back and relax, then go ahead and read this one too. If you have not read any of her works, don't start with this one."
1,Worst Book I've Read in Years,The only reason I bothered finishing this book is that I was on an 11 hour flight and had nothing else to do. Every plot point was so obvious the reader could see it coming like a freight train. How did this get published?
3,Very Funny Fluff,"This is an easy read, with some genuinely hilarious moments, especially the tart thoughts of the heroine. As usual, (if you've read Holden's other books,) Champagne D'Vyne turns up, and after much tribulation, all ends happily. Holden is clever and engaging; so much so that you don't resent her obvious delight with her own cleverness. She has an almost Dickensian knack for picking names of the supporting characters. As long as you don't mind knowing how it will end before you pick it up, you'll have a good time. If you are interested in comparing/contrasting the same type of thing, circa 1950 or so, find Margery Sharp's Something Light."
4,Another hit from Holden!,"This was another fun post-Bridget book. I love books in this genre, and this was no exception. Holden is really good at coming up with wild plots and carrying them through. We know how it is all going to end, but the fun is in getting there. A nude lobster-salad catfight <yeeooowwl!> is part of the climax. Need I say more?I also recommend Farm Fatale by the same author."
3,fun read!,"""Gossip Hound"" was a fun, quick read. sort of bridget jones-ish, girls who fantasize about find the right guy may find this amusing since the story line surrounds around love. Parts of it are really clever, funny and although the story was a bit unrealistic, that was what was entertaining about it. Holden's descriptions of ambitious journalist Belinda Black is hilarious! I'd recommend it."
2,Substandard,"This is one of the worst Bridget-Jones knock-offs I've ever read. At first I hoped that it would get better, but midway through I knew that wasn't going to happen and it was all I could do just to finish it. The characters were entirely unlikeable and the hijinks ridiculous."
1,I can't believe anyone thought this was good!,"There are two things about this book that are really fascinating...1) how the hell this tripe ever got published, and2) that the author is (supposedly) female when all the women characters in the book are so stupid, irritating and vacant.I bought this book for 25p at a jumble sale and it wasn't a bargain, it was about correctly priced (despite being hard back in perfect condition).I have struggled through it. This is desperate writing at its worst. The plot is horrifically obvious, the characters one dimensional and pathetic and the ""jokes/puns"" are strained and neither witty nor funny.If the two main characters were real women they would not have jobs. No one can mess up as much as these two brainless bimbos and remain employed...let alone receive promotions like these two do. The characters are so stupid that the reader is ten steps ahead of them all the time (which is so boring).Save your time and your money and read something else"
1,Bridget jones? What?,"It was a very uninteresting book. One of those books that is very hard to keep reading.. You know? This was so hard to continue as an assignment, and that is unusual for me to say as I read almost everything. I was very disappointed because it was nothing like what some are ""raving"" about. And unless you think choking and kicking a little dog is hysterical I wouldn't bother even picking it up."
2,disappointed,My dad used to get me this perfume in the 50's. I loved it and bought myself some. Then I had trouble finding it for a while and I ordered this with great excitement when I found it. I was terribly disappointed. I have the perfume and it is weak smelling and barely smells like the old Je Reviens. It has certainly not returned and I am very disappointed
4,Quick dissolving anti-gas antacid,"Even though their is no simethicone in it, this works very well for painful gas when dissolved in the mouth. As an antacid, use only 1 tablet or you will get rebound. This sweet spearmint formulation can burn the throat some."
5,Great Music,"Many of the other reviews say that this is targeted towards hardcore Hank Williams fans and it shouldn't even be on the market and Mercury records dosn't care about the fans and blah blah blah. Well this is the first Hank Williams record I have ever bought and I think it's excellent. I am a fan of good folk music and this is a great album featuring a single man with a soulful voice alone with his guitar, and that is all that really matters. So give it a listen if you like Woody Guthrie, Ramblin' Jack Elliot, or anybody else by the likes of them. Forget Mercury records, forget the attempt to cash in on Hank Williams; just listen to his incredible songs."
5,Really Glad I got this,"There is a Box set of Hank Sr. doing his thing on old time RadioShows, but it's expensive, and has a lot of Religious stuff on it.If you Like Just Hank and his Guitar, on Radio, and some Demos,this disk is for you.I'm really happy I bought it, cause I like that type of thing"
4,"Great little camera, but night shooting a little grainy.","I really like the long record time of this camera. I bought this camera for my trip to Europe, and it was great. It's small, yet powerful. I could record off and on for days before having to dump the movies on my laptop. I would suggest getting a second battery, preferably the 3 hour. The 5 hour is almost the size of the camcorder itself, and made it heavier.It was hard to find a case that is small enough for it, yet big enough to hold extra stuff like batteries. I bought the: CASE LOGIC TSC-4BLUE Sport Compact Camcorder Case. It doesn't even look like a camcorder case, which I also like.The software that comes with it takes some getting used to, but I think it works well.Night recording is a little grainy, but not too bad. I love that it has a wide screen option. The stability software works well; the hand shaking is greatly reduced.I don't like the quality of the still pictures it takes, but I have a separate 8mp camera."
2,MY JVCEVERIO MG40 AS AN EXPERIENCED CAMERA USER. EVEN TOOK COURSE IN COLLEGE,"I GIVE 2 POINTS AS I CANNOT ACCESS MY VIDEO FOOTAGE TO COMMENT ON QUALITY. THE CAMERA IS EASY TO RECORD. IT IS LIKE ALL OTHER CAMCORDERS. THE PRINT ON THE CAMERA IS VERY DIFFICULT TO READ EVEN WITH GLASSES. I AM NO TECHNOPEASANT BY ANY MEANS. I HAVE READ AND REREAD THE INSTRUCTIONS. I CAN NOT GET THE CAMERA TO REWIND OR PLAYBACK. I CALLED JVC. YESTERDAY I WAS ON HOLD FOR 45 MIN. WHEN A FEMALE PICKS UP THE PHONE, SAYS, I THINK! CALL BACK TOMORROW AND SLAMMED THE PHONE DOWN. I TRIED FOR HOURS TODAY TO GET THROUGH, EVEN TO GET THROUGH TO AN OPERATOR. NO LUCK, JVC SUCKS. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE 2ND BIGGEST CONSIDERATION YOU SHOULD TAKE ONCE YOU DECIDE TO BUY AN EXPENSIVE PRODUCT. WITHOUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE HOW CAN WE GET OPERATION INFORMATION WHEN HELP IS NEEDED . THINK ABOUT IT! WON'T YOU!"
4,Good Strut Tool,"This tool worked great for removing and reinstalling the rear strut springs on a Chrysler Cirrus. It did not work as good on the front. This was mainly due to the distance between the coils of the front strut springs being closer and the shaft of the tool being close to the Mcpherson strut top plate. However, overall, I am very happy with this tool."
5,Interesting Read,"I found this book to be very interesting. Although the novel includes very dark subject matters, there is an outrageousness that doesn't make it too real. I found it very entertaining and couldn't put the book down."
2,Eh,My book club chose this book. The description got me really excited to read it. I have to say that Bump was actually pretty flat. The author seemed to be working out her own obsession with suicide rather than developing her characters.
4,Well,"This is even not a bad effort of Herbie Hancock. I respect Herbie Hancock for doing the step into disco, R&B, Pop and Funk. Some people turned the back to Herbie when he started off with Headhunters. Some turned the back to Herbie when he started with albums like ""Monsters"". This is okay, but I respect Herbie for doing a step into this direction. And it's an enjoyable listen to me!Except ""Don't Hold it in"" and ""It all comes round"" this is a good Cd.No Jazz here!"
4,A classic is finally available,"Previously unavailable, this fine album by Herbie displays forward thinking in Jazz with it's early use of Apple computers on Stars in Your Eyes. The range of the songs runs from Rock oriented tracks courtesy of Carlos Santana to classic smooth jazz on Making Love.Although not as commercially successful as other albums it is an easy album to listen to and a welcome relief from his attempts to enter the electric funk/dance/pop world ala Rockit.True HH fans won't want to miss this album while it is still available"
2,The bottom of the barrel among Herbie's recordings,"Once again, Herbie's jazz talents are in hibernation as he concocts probably the worst album of his career. On STARS IN YOUR EYES he comes up with a decent effort in the attempted genre, but some of the tracks are pathetic, particularly IT ALL COMES AROUND, which doesn't even bother with tweaking the production-line mainstream rock genre that was then popular. SATURDAY NIGHT has a fiery solo by Carlos Santana on an otherwise average Latin-disco cut. Herbie himself is basically a sideman with few opportunities to solo. At the time of its original release, I recall this was the album where I jumped ship on HH's career (I did return later, though!)."
1,"Why bother, Herbie?","That's what I mean! Why even bother gathering all these talented people to produce such a boring album? At times these ""songs"" seem simply predictible and even cliche. I felt relieved when it was over.I bet Carlos Santana, Alphonse Mouzon and Wah Wah Watson (as well as Herbie himself) would gladly forget about this session!"
1,Herbie in 1980 disco-dance mode.,Picked this up in an antique store for a few bucks. Herbie in 1980 disco-dance mode. Very disappointing if you want jazz. Some interest due to guest stars like Carlos Santana. The cover by Gahan Wilson is better than the music inside.
5,Perfect,This is the perfect pad for staining. I used it on my cabinets and they look fantastic. 3 more words.
3,Pretty Interesting Book...,"I'm not catholic but this book is really neat.It hasinformation & nice illustraitions of over 100 saints.Even though I don't pray to the saints or ask forthem to intercede for me,it's just inspiring to readabout these martyrs,angels,priests,nuns,monks,& alot of others who lived a godly life."
2,Poor Quality Illustrations,"I got a copy of this book as an inspiration for my writing and art work. The illustrations are rather murky and not the clear, brightly colored images I recall from my childhood. The layout of the book is clunky and awkward as well - it seems that the elegance of the earlier book has been replaced with a book that crams one saint onto a page without regard for aesthetics. Many of the more strange and thrilling images that I recall seem to be missing as well, for example, St. Lucy holding her eyes in a dish. All those saints that were tied up, pierced with arrows, etc. look a lot less pretty and a lot more dull. Where are all the liquid eyes raised to the sky in patient suffering?Catholic nostalgia fans, seek out an older, used copy of this book. I know I will!"
2,Not as nice as I thought,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter to read and use as a reference. The pictures are more cartoonish than the cover leads you to believe. It's more reference, less story. She just can't seem to get interested in the stories because they don't have enough information. The book needs updated too. In one of the stories, I was surprised at the old fashioned reference to an African, now considered offensive by some people. Don't these books get PC updated once in a while?"
5,Very important book!,"If you aspire to be a successful trader, this has got to be on your bookshelf, more often then not though it should be in your hands! This is the real deal, no more of those books from the book stores for ten and twenty dollars. Make the purchase, this will put you one step closer to attaining the financial goals you aspire to. Check out Alexander Elder as well."
4,Expectancy is a good concept,"It's an easy to read book, which makes you to take a step back and review if your approach to trading or investing is going to reward you. I am an investor rather than a trader, but I still find the book interesting.His idea of EXPECTANCY, although not very rigorous and I do not like his informal approximation, is useful concept. Is this his origianl idea or did anyone find a similar concept with other authors?"
1,"Don't buy this book, don't waste your time reading it.","I really can't figure out why this book was written, other than the author's commission fees. It's long, repetitive, and doesn't have much actionable information. I've taken maybe 5 finance/investment classes, but I'm certainly not a sophisticated investor. Even so, for me the total information value from this book could be boiled down into 3 pages, tops.For the novice, this book would be impenetrable. For the advanced investor, the useful information would fit on a 3x5 card. I have no idea why people rate this book so highly."
1,Overrated - and how!,"I couldn't agree more with jsclinton, below. I had assumed that, with all the lavish praise I've seen heaped on this book, I was the one who didn't get it. All the mumbo jumbo must be of value, surely?No, I don't think it is. There is sufficient interesting information on position sizing to fill a small pamphlet, the rest is just endless filler."
4,finally i understand the risk management and position sizing,"though the author is not a trader,but he did a great job to explain about position sizing and risk management,which is essential in trading.trading is a depend on edge no matter what your trading system are,if u have the edge,u will come ahead.it also touched about the system testing and how u test the system..it is essential and this book worth a read."
4,LEARN Your Own Style Of Trading,"Mark LaMoure, Boise,IDVan Tharp in his book: 'Trade Your Way To Financial Freedom' introduces you to a rare and valuable stock book. It helps you discover your own style of stock trading.EXCEPTIONALThis is super-important for seeking success on the road to winning with stock investing. The book is a one-of-a-kind and precious. Read it and learn your own style of trading. A four star book."""
4,excellent book,"This is one of the best books i have ever read on investments and trading. But many may find it irrelevant or confusing on first reading. Being a trader and broker for the last 15 years, i could appreciate and understand varoius aspects discussed in the book. Further it also helped me get over various mis conceptions about trading and investing.But i do feel he could have charged a little more for the book and disclosed much more instead of refering to his other courses often.all said and done, an excellent book"
3,It has some very good points,"I found it to be a difficult read. This book repeats over and over the same claims and promises, some of which I was disappointed with as well. The Author did make a few good points that I have not seen elsewhere, so it does possess some definite value. It becomes fairly clear that the authorfs strengths are pyschology and promoting, and not neccessarily trading. It did encourage me to put aside some bias and fear, and for that I will give it credit. I do feel that my attitude towards trading will most definately improve after having read this book as well. I expected however, more on the mechanics of trading, and it was here that I felt let down. I also felt that the part of the book that compared the various trading systems, to be very weak. It used examples from the Motly fool and Warren Buffet. Excellent people to learn the concept of value investing from, but not exactly leaders in the area of technical trading"
5,Another vote for 5 stars.,"Readers get what they want out of this book.If you want to understand how to trade successfully and what all of the top Market Wizards have in common than read this book.It has some of the most detailed money mangement plans, ideas written in a book. Risk management is covered extensively. After reading this book quite a few times the reader will know terms such as R multiples, position sizing, and expectancy quite well. The trader who learns to use this terms in his trading consistently will eventually become consistenly profitable if they use and follow the terms above.This book MUST be read."
4,A Good Place to Develop Technical Trading Skills,"Recommending trading books seems like a fool's errand. In order to evaluate a book on trading, one has to know the experience of the potential reader. This is a book that will be most useful to someone with some background in trading, but not beyond intermediate experience. In addition the title and book jacket may promise the reader more than the book delivers, a common failing in this genre of literature.These caveats aside, this is a solid development of trading techniques. Recognize that Tharp does not solve your trading problems for you, he simply gives you some tools with which to develop your own trading style. All in all, a pretty wise approach."
3,Some solid concepts,"Update. I have re-read sections of the book, and I get it now. While this will not give you a specific stock-picking system the sections on risk management are very good. I am making this a solid 3 stars as a good read.----Original Review: The book provided an overview of what a system might consist - an evaluation of your beliefs and expectations. No detailed steps to get there, just some references to the need to develop a aystem, and some plugs for Dr. Tharps study courses on his website - including references to his supertrader program that might cost $40,000 to $50,000."
5,Hype vs Reality,"If you are a wishful thinker searching for the holy grail to riches in the financial markets and enjoy falling prey to con people after con people who out of sheer altruism want to share their great secrets with you, and who promise you that if you buy their invariably expensive systems/books all you have to do is work half an hour in the evening to gain incredible wealth, then do not buy this book.If however you are willing to accept that there is no holy grail waiting to be discovered, are serious about wanting to earn more than you lose in the financial markets over a relevant frame of time, then you will absolutely have to buy this book.Van Tharp tells it the way it is."
4,Good read for biginners and those already burnt.,"If you're a biginner or have already been burnt in the markets then this should be a very good read for you.There is nothing magical about the book. The points stressed are comon sense. They are mainly two points, cutting your losses short and learning how to size you positions in the market. The thing is you don't find much talk about comon sense now.Because the point of the book is pretty simple (and couldn't on its own provide material for a full book) the author tries to add some trading methodologies and techniques used by other successful traders to fill the space. These are only helpful for biginners as pointers to more detailed readings later on.Overall, its a good read that can serve as a very good starting point to trading. Don't take the title of the book literally though ..."
5,A great Teacher,"I'm commenting on the first edition, though I have read them both and own the first. For me Dr. Tharpe is a great teacher. These are fundamentals that are sound. Many of the negative reviews reflect the individuals biases, as mentioned by another reviewer. The best part of the book, you have decide for yourself. I was reminded of when I was in college and the professor made us really dig and stretch ourselves, because that is how learning occurs best. The fundamentals are covered in a way that is intended I believe not to introduce any certain preferences for this or that system. Learn the fundamentals and make them your own. In the markets there are many different ways to ""skin a cat"". What makes profits today might not tomorrow. But when you know the basics really well you can adapt, improvise, learn and improve. And survive the battle to win the war."
5,THE book for mathematical systems traders,"I've read a great many books about trading and investing, and in my opinion this book is the most informative and educational book on the market for traders who trade non-discretionary systems, or would like to learn the proper methods for doing so. His discussions of risk management, position sizing, and obtaining a real edge in the markets are second to none. Discretionary traders and investors will also benefit from this book, though systems are his focus.I don't understand how some of the other reviewers could call this book nonsense. It is not nonsense. As a trader who trades every day, I can tell you that you will learn and improve if you read and understand this book.Until you clearly understand risk management you do not have a significant long term edge in the markets. This book is one of the few out there that can teach you this."
1,Just read 7 habits,"This book is repetitive and monotonous... Just read seven habits.. it seems like a knock of it.It is more of a self help book than a traders book, and even though it focuses on investors.. making the name misleading in my opinion. Van does not trade... Enough said?"
1,Poor content,"I learnt much more reading books from Ralph Vince and Chuck LeBeau. This book is all about theory... If you like philosophy... If you don't, read Joe Krutsinger's books for instance."
2,20 pages of substance.....not really worth it.,"If you take away the parts of the book in which the author:...describes what is coming up next...summarizes other author's work...tells us how important this info really is...summarizes each chapter...and engages in endless and unnecessay verbosity, then your left with a solid.... but sadly 20 page book. I found this book to be lacking in both substance and clarity...It is clearly written by an academician not a trader......The irony is I recently heard Van speak at a seminar and was impressed with what he had to say...go figure."
2,A little bit for everyone and not enough for anyone,"Based on the overall excellent reviews, I was expecting to learn quite a bit from this book. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. Tharp doesn't say anything new, and talks at length about a lot of things that are really not helpful. And the helpful things are much better said by other authors.The book is full of contradictions (e.g., he advises the reader to sell all their stocks when they take a business trip, right after he talks about setting stops), as well as biased models designed to prove his point (e.g., his base scenario for position sizing is ridiculously naive).As with the reviews on the back jacket and many of the ""professional"" reviews on this site, I suspect that there is a lot of mutual back-scratching going on. If you're still interested in this book, borrow it from the library."
2,Over rated. Find another book.,"I think this book is over-rated. You can find better information in other books. For example, Alexander Elder's ""Trading for a Living: Psychology, Trading Tactics, Money Management,"" and William O'Neil's ""How To Make Money In Stocks: A Winning System in Good Times or Bad, 3rd Edition."" Both books are good and easy to read."
5,A Great Guide,A great guide to anyone who really wants struggle for his or her financial future through Trading...
1,Title misleading...,"First and foremost this is a book that promises to teach you how to Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom from a guy who does not trade himself but relies on second-hand information from those who do (supposedly) many of whom are referred to by first names only. Its like learning to fly from someone who is not a pilot - sure his observations may be interesting but what can he really tell you or show you what to do when the going gets tough or when you need some real, in the trenches advice?Why buy this book when there are so many much better books, newsletters and/or seminars out there by far more qualified authors, namely real traders with real track records? If you want books about traders, Jack Schwager's Market Wizards is a far better choice.Disclosure - Review copy provided free."
1,Useless. Cut your losses short and avoid this book,"Just like you are doing right now, I read the reviews posted here and bought the book (couldn't find it in the library). The author reviews some vague trading ideas used by others but doesn't describe any concrete method. In fact, it says ""You should create a system that works for you"". If I had that system, I wouldn't be buying the book in the first place. Be wise, cut your loss short and don't buy this book. You'll save time and money."
2,Overrated,"Very vague and scattered presentation of general trading theories. Most are just mentioned -- over and over. E.g., general types of stops mentioned as being ""good"" or ""useful"" with no statistical evidence whatsoever. The author is a solid writer, which disguises the fact that there is almost no useful content in the book."
5,All-Around Great Book!,"I have read many, many books on investing and trading, and this is one of the best. I use Investors Business Daily and O'Neill's method of stock selection and trade entries. This book is the perfect compliment to O'Neill's work. Tharp emphasizes the importance of money management and exits. His chapters on exits, setting stops, and money management are among the best investing pages I have ever read. In the past I usually made good entries using O'Neill's ideas, but I often let too much of my profit slip away once a stock started to decline. Now I feel confident about when to exit a trade. I am trading with less emotion and making more profits because of this book. It will also help an investor or trader develop a good system. An outstanding book!"
1,NUTS AND BOLTS MISSING,"Great theory, a stock that goes up 15 points will cover losses of 14 stocks that go down 1 point so control your losses and come out 1 point ahead. No practical information on how to set up a trading system, only generalizations. This is the same book this guy wrote 10 years ago.Great suggestions like be like Warren Buffet. Don't waste your money."
1,Not for trader,"The authors tried to cover many aspect of trading, from technical, fundamental, psychology,... he comes with a lot of information that bring nothing to your trading. He explain very simple thing in a complicate manner, sometime not easy to understand. I think he doesn't know much about trading and all his writing is from the conversation with others (limited) trader. If you are looking to learn about trading and want start to trade it is not a recommendation, you may try to read what Alexander Elder wrote for example. Anyhow, you don't need to buy them, you can download for free the E-Book using P2P such emule..."
2,"Advertisement for his workshops, letters, software etc.",He knows some stuff but you are not going to get it for 20 dollars
2,this is an advertisment for mr tharp and his friends,The book does have some interesting points.. But sometimes I feel like I have bought into an advertisement for Mr. Tharp's friends and his course. Albeit they maybe useful to you ... but please...I did not drop 20 bucks to get a 10 page ad trying to sell me more books.
3,Somewhat interesting.,"I found this book to be somewhat interesting. It did have some interesting facts that you may not find elsewhere, but there was lots of info that I did not find of any use. This may be one of those books you get the library to order for you before you decide to buy it for your personal library."
3,Slightly above average,"I really had mixed feelings about this book. I agree with some reviewers that 1) this book is biased towards long term investing and fund manager type of affluent investors. 2) there are many quasi-promotional messages for books and courses of Tharp and his friends. However, I must state that in the early chapters, Tharp had given lively illustrations of how people try to search for the holy grail (an invincible trading system/formula) in the market, the destined futility of such, and the importance of market timing and selection. It's a pity that only the beginning part is in place. The interested readers got to find much of the content and the ending elsewhere."
1,Will not lead you to financial freedom,"I bought this book based on the positive reviews, but found it to be disappointing. The author's writing style is difficult to read and he contradicts himself. He tries to appeal to a large audience by illustrating how some successful investors/traders (e.g. Warren Buffett) will do things. However some of these superstar investors implement strategies that are the antithesis of what Tharp is trying to promote. For example, Buffett never uses stops nor position sizing. He skims through some areas superficially. If you want to find out more, you need purchase additional products on his website. At the end of the day even Tharp has had only limited success in his teachings. Forget it and save your money."
5,great book,"Seems like most of the complaints about this book have to do with the idea that it doesn't lay out some perfect trading system. No book can do that. It does, rather, what it's supposed to do and help you develop the proper mindset to develop a system of your own. I think it does this very well. I truely think it's in a class by itself."
5,A Rappin' Great Time - Party Game,"Just had to pick this up when I saw the song list...it's got All the heavies, Dre, Tupac, Biggie, Snoop, Missy, on and on. The game did a decent job of scoring your performance, while it can't figure out which word you're saying (neither can Karaoke Rev.) it can tell if you're rapping in the right place. Apparently you can cheat by mumbling or rubbing the mike with your hand, but if that's your thing then maybe this game isn't for you. If you DO WANT TO RAP though, this game shines in Party Mode. There's nothing better than gettin your gangsta style on with your friends watching, and it's even better to laugh at your friends doing the same. We had a room full of people with all different ages, kids to young parents, and everyone knew at least one song....Great time."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"This game is garbage. I can't believe I thought it would actually be good and I bought it, but that's just my own stupidity. Half the songs on here could be replaced by much better, classic rap songs. The game is terrible at judging the words you say and even if you're on beat or not. Maybe it's more fun and better to the average music listener, but you'd think in order to make a game like this, they would have gotten real rap experts' input. Another thing, WAY too easy. I beat it in 2 hours, and there's not much more you can do after you beat the game in career mode. LET DOWNNNNN"
3,Charming little book,"Faint praise you say? Ok, maybe my ruffly apron is tied too tight today. The history and the cultural sections were excellent but the numerous recipes were unwelcome, mere space fillers. In fact most of the contents were fillers, neatly boxed items you could cull from a rural calendar or a few copies of Country Living. Great book for short attention spans and folks who have no trouble falling asleep. You won't fall asleep in the middle of anything in this book, nothing's that long. Which reminds me, the hardcover version is not 288 pages as stated on amazon. It's 276 pages, and that includes 54 pages of: afterword, acknowledgements, five appendices, sources, permissions, index and ""about the authors."""
5,A fascinating adventure,"This book is a treasure trove of information and well crafted tales of modern day adventures. While one reviewer here seems peeved that the author has enjoyed such travels, I for one found his stories fascinating. This book would make an excellent gift for anyone with culinary leanings or an interest in the history of nature's sweetest treasure."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this product, knowing that of course it was inexpensive and not meant for a party of 300. I was very disappointed when I used it for the first time and discovered how extremely LOUD it was. My friends asked, ""Can you turn that thing off?"" It was a fun novelty and it did have the fountain appeal, but the motor (even in a large group) is too loud. I contacted the Helman Group who manufactures this item and they said that is just the way it is. Apparently, it's no lemon. I'm going to try the Rival next and return this one (hopefully)."
3,chocolate fondue fun,I'd give it 3&Half starts for fun. i paid $46.95 elsewhere for this. we used it for my daughter's sleepover party and will probably use it for the holidays as well. easy to use. follow directions for melting chocolate with oil.. we needed to add a bit more to make it flow...It is a 2 person job to clean it up though as you need to pour out the excess chocolate after it cools....
2,Please Be Quiet!,"We used ours for the first time in February, during the Olympics. We had some friends over for a viewing party and decided against putting it in the TV room with us. It is just way too loud. I've sort of lost my enthusiasm for using it now. The Rival one I just noticed said it has a ""whisper quiet"" motor. Truly? I may have to check that out. I'd recommend not getting the Nostalgia one, if you like to be able to hear your guests and background music."
4,Great conversation piece,"I bought this fountain when I first had seen it on TV. I wanted a commercial fountain but couldn't justify spending so much money on one. I have enjoyed having it at showers, birthday and cookouts. The Key to melted chocolate is not to heat it over 104- 113 degrees anything higher and it will burn. I use merkens chocolate melts for melting and molding chocolate. It takes only a small amount of MELTED CRISCO to get it thin enough. Merkens chocolate can be bought at any cake decorating supply store. You can also use chocolate from AC Moore or Michael's Crafts. You will find that it melts much better than chocolate chips! I have also used it for cheese fondue. Make a cheese sauce starting with white sauce and it works great!The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because you have to be careful when cleaning not to get the bottom wet.Other than that I say EAT CHOCOLATE EVERY DAY!"
2,it was ok,This product is great if you boil your chocolate and add A LOT of oil to thin the chocolate. It's a good product but I was disappointed to find that the unit doesn't keep the chocolate warm while it's circulating through.
3,"Overall, it's worth buying.","My family and I love our chocolate fountain. It's pretty simple to set up and use. Clean up was a bit more difficult, but nothing hot water and a sponge can't fix. It takes 24 oz. of chocolate to run, so plan on having quite a few guests if you don't want to waste chocolate. We used the fountain for about an hour and the chocolate was warm the entire time. Overall, I'd say it's worth the money."
1,chocolate expolosion,"The chocolate would not melt properly. The motor is very loud. And when a piece of solid chocolate tried to enter the auger, the tower dislodged from the motor. The motor responded to the decreased load by instantly increasing the rpm's. The liquid chocolate could not contain itself and began to fly off the spindle in a perfect circle pattern, with a 2 foot radius. An explosion of chocolate showering two people, several bottles of wine, a bottle of Baileys, a decorative tray, the countertop, and the floor. Clean up was easy, only requiring 6 people and 30 minutes. Great for a gag gift, but I do not recommend using it around small children or pets."
2,don't buy,We bought two for a party (for a vienese table). One was not working at all. The other worked well. So 50% chance that this purchase will work for you.
2,Rare music,"I picked up this two-disc set because I am a fan of Dvorak's music. Having listened to this set, I am glad I got it on sale. These four tone poems are nowhere near as enjoyable as the nine symphonies, and the orchestration itself is somewhat bland. Overall, not that great a purchase except for the die-hard Dvorak fan."
5,Priest,Really different take on a vampire movie! You really have to watch more than once to take it all in.
3,I've seen better Vampire Movies,This was to short and to the point. It wasnt enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. The graphics were good and I got the whole bad ass thing but it still didnt feel like enough
4,priest,"some people thought fast five is five star ,yet this is a two star no way osund like some kind of prejudice. this is a four for action"
4,Great comic adaptation,"I haven't read the graphic novel (and probably won't), but this movie has everything I look for in a comics-to-movie adaptation. The post-apocalyptic setting works well, and the evil hierarchy that controls the population, and the vampires (just scary monsters, really, but cool in their way). And, of course, the little band of warriors. Their loyalty betrayed by their leadership, they go off and do the heroic Right Thing anyway. There's a teeny bit of romantic tension, too, creating yet another kind of divided loyalty.Visually, this has a dark and somber look, borderin on monochrome - a good match to the monastic tone set by the heroes. Although the director didn't leave us dangling with obvious sequel-bait, I can see this turning into a successful franchise. Unlike another unfortunate comic-based movie out at the same time, I'll come back for more of this one.-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters"
2,"How'd you like to get this priest in the confessional? (""Say 800 Hail Marys, then go slay 97 vampires."")","PRIEST (2010) is the initial offering in what may become an endless ""kill the vampires"" series.Has everything I hate about modern movies: shaky camera work, bad acting, too much CGI and constant violence in lieu of dialogue, character development or any semblance of nuance.A cinematic sledgehammer that's geared to teen boys of all ages (13 to 83)."
4,CGI Extravaganza,"It seems like Paul Bettany can play about anybody and bring life to the character. In the future Priests are vampire hunters and the council has descided there are no more vampires so the Priests have been disbanded. Not to give too much away but the council is wrong and the meanest vampire of all has kidnapped ""The Priests"" neice in a ploy to confront him for personal reasons and restart the slaghter of mankind and the vampries domination of earth. The story is good and there is plenty of action, not too much gore so don't let the fear lof blood splatter scare you away from a fun film. The film has a great cast with Maggie Q, Karl Urban, and a brief appearance from Stephen Moyer from ""Tru Blood"". The movie is a fast 87 Minutes so cook some popcorn, grab a soda, and have some fun."
4,Why don't they make an unrated dvd version?,"This is a good movie,full of action..they should have it available in all versions,it is simply ridiculous....make all all versions available for everyone"
3,Priest review,"Overall an interesting premise, but a little scant on backstory. Good casting - Paul Bettany and Karl Urban as adversaries in a futuristic world where vampires run amuck in a barren wasteland, and people live in dank, dark , industrial polluted cities run by a dictatorial theocracy - Catholic church to the extreme."
2,Not so good.,"Boring, over-glammed and not at all engaging. Paul Bettany is great when he's not a dark action hero. In this and, particularly, Legion, he is disappointing. It might just be me, but graphic novels do not translate well to the screen. Maybe its because they almost always get crappy directors and poor actors. This movie is average for what it is, which means its not that good. Whoever made the trailer deserves the credit because they made it look good."
1,Horrible,"This is the WORST movie I have ever seen. I mean come on, a post-apocolypic, religious, cowboy, action, vampire movie?? Are you freaking kidding me? How stupid. My IQ dropped within the first 10 minutes of this dvd. Terrible acting, and terrible everything else. Rediculous and a waste of time. I wouldn't watch this movie again if I was paid to."
1,What a waste...,"The first 10 minutes or so I was thinking this movie wont be too bad, maybe the critics got this one wrong as they do with many films, but nope they were right this movie flat out stunk. The acting was awful, the script...was there a script??? was flat out lame and the special effects were not impressive. I cant believe they actually shot this in 3D, ouch. I personally started to fall asleep towards the end. If you want to see this flick just hit up the local red box. Forgive me Father for watching this film, have mercy on my soul."
4,Better than thought!,"Same Vampire concept but with ""FUTURE OLD"" twist. Buy it you'll like it. Short but sweet with a good ending."
3,"Nice effects, but the story left me wanting","Nice effects, but the story left me wanting. The lead up to the final battle was great, but then it just ended. Sure it left room for another movie, but still I would have expected a bit more."
3,Entertaining movie,"I liked the story, and it was a decent movie, but there was a huge technical problem that really made the movie much less enjoyable than it could have been. Ive tried it on every player in the house and have the same problem. The soundtrack is louder than the actors, so you can barely hear whats being said-at some points i had to turn on close caption so i could follow the story:( Other than that, it was a decent movie."
4,Very cool movie & action packed!!!,"I have to admit, I watched this movie twice before getting the whole theme. However, it's definitely worth seeing even purchasing if your're a vampire and martial arts fan. The story line is consistent and I think Blade(with Wesley Snipes) would have performed better if it had some of the church cover-up like in this movie."
2,Over before it started,Be warned......this movie is only 1 hour and 20 minutes. When it actually started to get good....the credits started to roll. It was more like a trailer for the next HBO series.Overall it could have been good had it been twice as long but yawn........ what a disappointment.
1,horrible,"How this movie has only a PG-13 rating is mind boggling. Proof that morals have slipped even further. Viewers beware, this is an extremely violent movie, one that should have been rated R."
1,Not Impressed,"After all the hype about this director scheduled to do the Mortal Instruments movie and how well Lilly Collins did in this, I was disappointed. I'm not a film snob, I know the value of entertainment for the masses verses the critics. I was expecting more. Collins' was subpar at best. Cam Gidandet wasn't much better. The script was terrible and overall acting OK. I think it takes a truly awful director to get such poor performances out of actors like Karl Urban and Paul Bettany. Do yourself a favor in this tough economy skip buying a hardcopy and wait for it on cable."
2,Are a few good visuals worth the list price???!!!!!,"I was considering the purchase of this movie for the few interesting visuals it has.....but then saw the price. What's going on with SONY? When most recorded music and movies are dropping in price, they're releasing a single-disc, bare-bones film at $30.99!!! You just know that this one will be in the $5 bin within a few months...and THAT'swhen I'll buy it! If they had started off with a $20 list, I would have gotten it now. It's not like this is a hot movie that everyone is raving about!"
1,No No Nooooooo !!!!!!,THis movie is not worth your well earned money and time.Please please do not bother or join me in the ranks of people who think this money should have gone to charity instead.
1,Bad,"When this film was screening at the local cinema, I had to choose between Hanna and this. I'm glad I chose Hanna. This movie has nothing to do with the Korean manhwa, which is awesome. Storyline is loose, and unconvincing. Everything is bit and piece, here and there, a lot of posings and not enough real acting. Main characters are dead stiff. The CG vampires are actually more fluid than real actors. One star for the CGI, zero star for the flick. The last time I saw the big-screen film failed this epic was Star War III. Well, to be fair, Priest is way worse."
3,Priest,"This movie started out with a bang, but fizzled quickly. The special effects kept the movie a little interesting. The movie seemed as if the writer got tired of writing and decided to quickly cut it short."
3,Agreed: Meh.,"While there was nothing wrong with anything in this movie -- everyone involved did a solid, competent job -- there just wasn't very much to it. I am sure that as a comic book, the two-page splash panels of Priests riding their turbine-engine motorcycles across trackless wastes of desert leaving long dust trails in their wake were glorious works of visual splendor. However, there are no splash panels in movies. There are just long tracking shots of Priests riding turbine-powered motorcycles across a wasteland, which go on just a bit too long -- long enough for you to get slightly bored and start to wonder how the hell anyone thought it would be a good idea to stick a turbine intake duct on the front of a motorcycle that is driving through blowing sand and grit. Everyone is grim and relentless and badass, which sounds good except that if everyone is cool, then no one is. I didn't feel like I had wasted my time seeing it, but I was glad I had waited for the Amazon rental."
1,Makes you appreciate...Twilight(shudder). That is the horror of it all.,"Vampires are back. No says Vampire Killing Council. Yes says Young Priest. No says council head and dont mention it ever again. Young Priest heads out to save neice or whoever she was. Vampire killing council sends killers to kill young priest. Vampires that are not back kill Vampire killer council flunkies.Young Priest kills boss Vampire. People trampled in mad rush to leave scene of tasteless, talentless movie."
1,This priest CANNOT SAVE the soul of this movie,"- The special effects are terrible. In many scenes, I can see clearly that they're drawings.- The fighting scenes are boring.- And the acting...I'm not sure if there is any acting here.- There is no suspense, horror or excitement.In short, this film fails both on acting and directing.No wonder, it flopped at the box office. Boxofficemojo dot com said this film grossed $29,136,626 domestically."
2,"Writers, Directors and Producers - STOP IT!","I absolutely cannot stand what current Hollywood producers, Directors and writers are doing in regards to their version of what Vampires are and what they can and cannot do. Vampires don't walk around in the DAYTIME - period!! (TWLIGHT SERIES) And they do not live in HIVES! (PRIEST) I mean, are you kidding me! The films may be entertaining but please get back to the basics - which could be a really fun and bloody entertaining!"
2,History got snubbed w/ this 1,"Purchased it w/ playstation on discount ~Unless Ur download was completely ""screwd"" or U ordered the wrong formatSony is reluctant 2 cut ya a break :( w/ a wallet refundIf the movie wasn't sooo heavy handed w/ it's attitude w/ catholics (which I am not) just enjoy sound history :)If a movie insists upon pushin' this issueI don't believe the catholic church has ever been the equivalent of 1984 or the soviet empire or 3rd reich ~ come on now ~Cory Goodman ~ pick on the muslims ~ c how that goes :)However ~ if it playd more like a jedi order vs vamps ~ campy yes ~ improvement @ least :)Personally ~ I thought ass~asins creed did a bettr job w/ the issue ~Even though it's pro-jihad-ists attitude ~ isn't exactly praise-worthy :-PAs for vamp films ~ I recommend the blade series to this sneaky ~ pop-corn ~ propagandist film :)"
2,Priest,"I didn't care for this movie.It had bad dialogue,no character develepment,bad CGI and the vampires looked like something from Resident Evil and to think they left it open for a part 2."
4,Pretty good,"First off I would like to say that I am not a fan of vampire movies, but this one really made me want to see more as the movie went on. The fighting scenes are the best parts. I was disappointed by the fact that the movie ended kinda quickly. It seems that somehow you know the boss vampire is not dead, but anyway I wouldn't mind seeing a part 2 in the future. Overall if you like the movie Blade you should definitely check this movie out."
3,"Was pysched out when I saw previews, now let down.","Was pysched out when I saw previews, now let down. I'm glad I didn't waste my money going to the theater to see it. It was some what entertaining, I expected more blood or more contact fighting skills. But all in all it was just okay."
4,Brain candy with an interesting plot.,"This movie is a pretty good watch for what it is, a 90 minute look at vampires through a different lens. The church is cast in a rather medieval format, which seems to lend this movie something of a unique story line. Its not as terrible as some recent releases, like skyline, and I would recommend it to anyone with 90 minutes to kill."
4,unrated version not different from regular version,This review is only to comment on the unrated version of this movie. It's not really any different from the theatrical version. I didn't notice any new or different scenes. Don't pay more for the unrated version.
4,I enjoyed the movie.,"The movie was good. The basic storyline was similar to many vampire movies in a lot of ways but it kept me interested. There was a good amount of action, not too much gore, and the characters were well portrayed. It could have been better but I don't have any regrets about purchasing it."
4,PRIEST,THIS IS A GOOD ACTION MOVIE WITH A PLOT. I LIKE IT. ITS NOT THE BEST BUT IT WILL KEEP YOUR ATTENTION.
3,Boring...,This movie was sadly underwhelming the blu-ray looked pretty good but there wasn't much to look at in terms of graphics to many bland scenes. Also the story just dragged on the putrid plot. Sad...
2,priestP,"a post apocalyptic mix of Vampires- James Woods, The Search- John Wayne, Time Machine- Rod Taylor and a host of other... a pletheura of been there, seen that. Special effects looked expensive but were either to long in duration or to fast to see clearly. Disconnected seque's and a real dissapointment. The only redeeming quality was the lead actor."
2,Priest didn't live up to its hype,"Priest had its good moments but it never took off for me. Being a huge fan of vampires, the plot was promising....a new and improved group of vampires attacking an already demolished world and only fighters who were actual Priests had the strength to fight them. However, somewhere along the way the director missed his mark. The dialogue needed revision, the vampires weren't shown attacking innocent people enough, and the Priest lacked in being a good action hero. I found myself greatly disappointed at the end of the movie."
3,Meh,"I really had hopes for this movie. Can't really fault anyone's acting; everyone was trying really hard, but there just wasn't enough THERE there."
3,Special Effects First Rate,"Technically, the film was awesome, but the story was only okay, and only if you like this kind of film.It wasn't a bad film, but the subject matter was a little too dark for me. I doubt that I will watch it again."
3,Could Have Been A Smash Hit,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. But in the end, all the awesome graphics/effects, actors, scenes, motifs, and moods are all overshadowed and washed out by a terrible script/plot/dialogue.I don't know if it was the director, the writer, or a combination of both, but they fell short in making this one a definite keeper. Sad, because this theme is definitely in ""style"" now too. If anyone was to ever remake this movie and fix the shallow plot and dialogue I have no doubt it would be a mega hit that could even turn into a series.I guess the only thing I can say is, it is worth watching, because depending on how you view movies, you may really enjoy this. Basically it is one of those movies that I think you just have to see for yourself, because it is hard to describe how it's great and bad at the same time without you having seen it."
3,Alright.,"This movie was OK... not the best, but not the worst I've seen. Like most vampire movies... it was dark and depressing... but it wasn't bad. I like the actors and the acting was fine. It was a different kind of vampire hunting movie, but I can't say I was thrilled with it. If you like vampire/vampire hunter movies I'd recommend that you watch it... but don't go all out of your way to do it."
3,Vampire western?,"This was a solid film. A mesh of a few different genres: sci-fi, horror, western. I say western because of the environment as well as the whole revenge/hostage part of the story. Mostly though this was just a good escape film.My initial interested in Priest was the cast, which included Madchen Amick (Shelly from Twin Peaks) and Stephen Moyer (Bill from True Blood). It was cool to see those two worlds connect, but sadly they were only in the film the first five minutes. However the Priest and the rest did fine in their roles. The vampires looked much more demonic than any I've seen in other movies. Monsters really. However the main vamp was half human, and looked it.In closing remember this, ""when you go against the church, you go against God""."
1,crappy cgi over crappy no sense story bleh,so tired of really fake cgi even if it is video game detailed looking liek somethign from doomcrap storyrent only
1,Pure dribble,"McKiernan's Iron Tower Trilogy was completely stolen and plagiarized from Tolkien, but the books are still a decent read albeit at a very childish level and worth three stars, barely.McKiernan writes at a very amateurish, childish level. All his characters are completely scripted. The bad guys always lose, the hero's can all jump tall buildings in a single bound and and always win and get that girls.McKiernan is also horrible at foreshadowing or having any twists whatsoever in his books. Everything is completely scripted and you can predict every before it even happens.While the Iron Tower Trilogy was decent at a very childish level The Silver Call Duology, however, is just pure garbage, pure dribble, and worthless from the first page to the last.I judge books on how quickly I want to read them again and how good they were the second time through, but these books aren't even worth reading completely the first time through."
2,Not impressed,"Keep in mind this book is 10 years old. It alternates color and B&W pages and the B&W pictures aren't high-quality. It gives a decent overview for each variant, but by no means a comprehensive walkaround for any of them."
3,Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever book,The book had a lot of basic dog information and not enough on the breed it was supposed to cover.
2,Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever: Special Rare-Breed Edition,A rather generic book that pastes a few ducktoller specific pages in the front and inserts ducktoller pictures throughout. 90% of the content is general info about dogs.
1,Not enough jasmine aroma,"I love Jasmine Green tea, hence I wanted to give this Twinings Jasmine Green Tea a try. I am disappointed. Yes, there are some jasmine petals and there is a weak jasmine smell when you open the tin, but the jasmine aroma is very very weak in the resulting brewed tea. Yes, one can use more tea than the usual amount trying to get some jasmine flavour, but this time the resulting tea ends up very bitter. I have had far more flavorful jasmine green teas from tea stores, or even the jasmine green tea I recently got at a Peet's Coffee & Tea store was far more aromatic.If you like your jasmine green tea with 'jasmine' flavour (like me), I would not recommend you buying this tea. On the other hand, if you are looking for a jasmine green tea with very very weak jasmine flavour, then this tea might be a good choice for you."
5,Twinings Jasmine tea,"This is very good tea from a reputable tea manufacturer. Since it comes as a six pack, you can share it with other tea loving friends."
4,More good space at last,"The link at echoes.org was for a different CD, but I got this one instead, so I ordered it anyway. Well written tunes, full of shifts in tempo and rhythm, effects, etc. The rhythm synthesizers sound tinny or harsh at times. Thought I might blow a speaker, but didn't. A very good listen all-around, tho. Really enjoyed cooking while listening to it. You can listen to it for hours before you ask yourself if you've heard a particular song before. The true mark of good space music."
5,Old but Cool,"Found this just noodling around mp3s, Old electro but I had never heard before, like it when on highway, good background on highway driving."
1,SILVER PALACE,"For real Airstreamers, this video was a big disappointment. The video contained too little Airstream footage, and too much about rallys and interviews with trailer owners, who offered no real insight. The price was steep for much frustration, as I fast forwarded through useless footage to view Airstreams. I do not recommend this purchase for Airstream owners."
5,A resource every wedding party needs.,"When it came time for my own wedding, I was probably like most men whose focus wasn't on the details. Mine wasn't until I was given a copy of 'I NEED TO DO WHAT"". Immediately I changed my attitude about our ""big day"" and followed the guide which Mr. Van Deusen has prepared so well. This book helps divide up the responsibility so that everything that happens is supposed to happen. Nothing was left out...before, during and after. When my bride saw that her ""men"" knew what we were doing, her stress level went down and so did her mother's. Thanks to this book, I enjoyed my wedding day more than I ever could have imagined. I think this was mostly because I did more than show up, I helped make it happen."
2,I Need To Do What?,"This book reads like a high school term paper (i.e. 50 pages of courier font). For example, ""If a bachelor party is planned, it can be held at the Groom's house, in a club, hotel, restaurant, or possibly in a back room of a nightclub . . . ."" Real helpful. I doubt that anyone would pay more than a couple of dollars for this book in a bookstore."
4,Great book by a great man,"What a great Bible teacher. If you like McGee, let me make another suggestion. If you want to understand prophecy (specifically the Premillennial/Pretribulational model) within the context and flow of the Bible, I suggest you check out the book ""The History of the Future: A Commentary on Revelation and Matthew 24"" by Marvin Blackburn, Timothy D. Blackburn. This is an excellent book for the beginner and more advanced student."
5,FANTASTIC,"This is a terrific reprint of the first edition. Very fine binding, crisp text, great illustrations!"
4,Music with which to flatten dancefloors,"If your ears aren't ringing by the end of this album, you didn't have the volume high enough. Turn it up and try again. This is music that you have to physically FEEL to fully appreciate.This is some of the best hard minimal techno that I've heard in a while. There's not a trace of melody - just layers of stiff, atonal sequences that fade in and out, in lockstep to the relentless stomp of the kick drum. It's a little cleaner and a little more calculated than most hard techno, but every bit as tough and uncompromising.The album is a continuous mix, which works quite well with the style of music; the joins are so seamless that I was unable to tell when one track had ended and the next had begun without checking the CD display. The mix starts out relatively subdued and gets harder and faster as the disc progresses.Highly recommended to any fan of the genre. (I'd give it five stars, but the first half of the disc is weak compared to the harder second half.)"
4,seeing is not believing and believing is not seeing,"I found the story to be geographically interesting (because it is Moscow), imaginative like Dante's Inferno, politically relevant (from a historical perspective), and just plain weird. It is so strange and twisted that I would rarely recommend it to someone. On the other hand, if someone has already read it, it would be enchanting to speak with them about it. In addition, if Russian literature and history thrills you, then this is a must read and an enjoyable read. Buried inside all the wonderful illusions and hideous acts, woven amongst demented and scandalous characters, and set against biblical allegories I only partially understand, is a beautiful and haunting romance, a couple of true soles and some diabolical mysteries that captivate. Sometimes, seeing is not believing and believing is not seeing."
2,Not the best translation,This translation does not read well in english. It is too literal. My russian wife say all the humor is lost. The best translation is the Michael Glenny.
1,Description fails to name translator,"This book was just referred to me.However, I find it unacceptable that given the following comment, the Kindle description does not name the translator, though one can figure it out...""Without a doubt, the book in the original Russian is incomparable, but if you don't read Russian I would recommend the Burgin/Tiernan O'Connor translation. The first translation I ever read was Mirra Ginsburg's - although it is very charming and enjoyable, certain bits of conversation as well as almost an entire chapter are omitted from this translation. I have also read parts of Michael Glenny's translation, and I don't feel that his translation accurately relays the depth, rhythm and richness of Bulgakov's style. Burgin/Tiernan O'Connor has given the most complete and accurate translation of this work.""Folks! There's an easy fix for this!Tks"
3,"Good, but...","I've read a bunch of Russian literature, but I have to say, this one just didn't do it for me. For a dedicated reader willing to invest the time to research all of the biblical references and study Russian history, it could be a very rewarding read. For the sophisticated but casual reader, though, I found it too unfocused and rambling. The core themes and ideas are clear and present, but at points they become obscured by long, sometimes irrelevant tangents."
2,Gruelingly Repetitive,"After hearing the same story repeated for the fifth time, I skimmed through the pages. You could have cut the book by 300 pages and gotten your story across. There were some good parts here and there. But, this was one of the most gruelingly repetitive books I've ever read. I'm glad the author found solace. I finally ended the book thinking, I wish you would have confronted your mother. I'm sure she would have denied and not given you what you wanted, but at least you would have confronted her, and could say, you tried. I'm glad that's over."
3,You get a hit and your mind goes ping!,"First, let me say this : Rocky Horror Picture Show is a great movie that everyone - of any age - will enjoy. I bought this Cd because the movie had such awesome music. But, upon listening to this Cd soundtrack, I was disapointed and realised this Cd is only worth 3 and 1/2 stars.The good things about this Cd is that it has the speaking parts from the movie that lead up to the songs. It also has the lyrics to he songs, which is ALWAYS a plus!But, as with most things, there are also cons. 'Once in a While' is a song, sung by Barry Bostwick(Brad), which didn't appear in the movie. This song is horrid and I don't know why they bothered putting it on this soundtrack. Also, songs are not how they were in the movie. For example, in 'Time Warp' it is sung differently than how it was in the film.But, over-all, for a RHPS fan this Cd is a must have."
4,Fond Memories,"This CD is great. It includes more than just the music from the movie. It has some of the dialogue as well. It also includes a song that was not in the actual motion picture, but it is a nice addition. Anyone wanting to be able to remember going to this midnight movie would truly enjoy owning this CD."
2,Still a mess,"Why is it so hard for someone to just release all the songs from this movie on CD?!?The movie version of ""Time Warp"" is STILL not here. It is ridiculous that in 2004 you can't buy the entire version of the Time Warp on CD. If they wanted to include the edit, they could have included both versions.And record companies wonder why people have to download music from the internet."
3,Not The FULL OST,"Yes I agree, I was disapointed to find that this did not contain the ""Hot Dog"" song (right after ""Plant, Chmanet, Janet""). And to find that the songs that they did include (Sword Of Damocles and Once In A While), were yanked from the movie. But I am one for soundtracks, especialy Rocky's..s."
5,great resource,"took me a while to find a copy. if you are climbing in the canadian rockies, this is the guide."
5,Simple Concept,"Gary Chapman is 100% correct. The concept is so simple it makes me wonder why I had to read it in a book. As I was reading the book I kept saying ""of course"" to myself. I have put this on my yearly reading list so I don't forget the vital information Gary Chapman has shared. I have also given this book away many times as a wedding gift."
5,A Must For Every Marriage,"My husband and I read this book with several other couples during a marriage enrichment class. It helped us tremendously and we didn't even think we had any communication issues! I have recommended this book to dozens of people, and they all say what a positive impact it has on their relationships. It's definitely a must read for anyone interested in learning how to truly communicate with and express the right ""love language"" to their spouse."
5,language of affirmation,"I really appreciated this book's perspective that to get your message of love across, you have to be speaking the right language. It's not about just doing your same old thing harder, it's about understanding how your partner takes in things and communicating how they need to hear it. This book helped me see that my partner needed more Words of Affirmation. If yours does too, I strongly recommend you get a new little book called WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU (by Kate and David Marshall) and give it to him/her as a gift. It will make him/her very, very happy."
2,Great Concept - Too many words,"I love it. Five love languages. Each of us has our own value placed on each one. That's it! - that's the whole book in two sentences.It's awesome, but you don't really need to read much more. Here they are... all five:1. Words of Affirmation2. Quality Time3. Gifts4. Acts of Service5. TouchNow, you have the whole book. There's not much more to it, except that he basically says the same thing over and over again with different words. I think maybe if he distilled it down to about 20 pages, this would have been an awesome book!"
5,Enlightening book,"The five languages of love is a very enlightening book. I found it very helpful because I now am able to recognize how people have different ""love languages"" in which they express themselves and if one becomes ""fluent"", there is less miscommunication and more harmony when relating. It was fun to find out which is my personal love language!!Another book that I found helps transform relationships in a magical way, is ""How to Create a Magical Relationship"" by Ariel and Shya Kane. With humor and compassion they guide the reader thru the pitfalls of relationship, and like magic, one starts experiencing more fulfilling and passionate relationships - including the one with yourself. I highly recommend it."
5,The Best Book I Have Ever Read,"This is, without a doubt, the best book I have ever read. Dr. Chapman writes at the very end that he wishes he could give a copy of this book to every married couple. I have to agree with that statement wholeheartedly. The concepts as he presents them are so simple and basic yet incredibly profound. I cried as I was reading when Dr. Chapman described couples with problems that sounded almost exactly like my marriage. My husband is reading the book and we are once again beginning to communicate our love for each other. We still need counseling to work everything out, but Dr. Chapman's book may have almost single-handedly saved yet another marriage from the brink of divorce. I think everyone with a loved one (and I certainly hope everyone has SOME loved ones - children, parents) can benefit from the simple and understandable concepts in Dr. Chapman's books."
5,productive and positive approach to building relationships,"I was impressed with the positive perspective in this book. Yes, relationships are hard. But with some work, they can be great. This book was helpful...without the psych-babble or the lame gender excuses. Provided a helpful framework for understanding yourself and your mate better, and some good discussion questions to get conversations started. Finally figured out the secret to what makes my current relationship challenging. Now my boyfriend (who also enjoyed reading this!) and I feel positive about how we can build a better future together."
5,The Five Love Languages,"This book is excellent and I would recommend it to all married couples, couples thinking about marriage and anyone in a relationship. It breaks down our communication preferences in laymen terms - This is definitely a book that will make you go - Hummmmmmmm. So that's it! You will find that your relationships will improve if your practice the suggestions. My husband and I have both read it and purchased 15 additional copies for our church members. My husband and I had an excellent relationship before reading this book and The Five Love Languages has now enhanced it. Thank you Mr. Chapman!"
5,Marriage After Adultery,"Gary Chapman has presented his insight into healing broken marriages. Both my husband and I are learning to ""speak"" each other's love language to heal our marriage that was corrupted from his adultery. This is a must book for marriages in trouble."
5,"I liked the book, so I guess I'm not your average guy...","SEX!Now that I've got the attention of all the other men out there, let me continue my review...This book is a definate 10 in my opinion. I learned a LOT about myself I didn't realize. The relationship with my girlfriend grew a lot faster than before I read this book.I chalk it up to knowing how to ""speak"" her ""love languages"", and how to interpret hers.Every guy out there should read this book, even if they're not in a relationship or married. Yes, for the average guy that loves hockey, fixing cars and watching action movies, the book may seem like a waste of time. But give up a hockey game some night to read this book.I can't guarantee results, but boy, you'll sure learn a lot about why she acts the way she acts, and how you can rekindle the spark in your relationships."
5,I reccomend this book all the time!,"Really, this is one of the best books out there. We all have different ways of communicating, and this book makes it clear that one person's way of expressing love may not feel like love to another. If we can speak our mate's ""language"", and them ours, we're all set. Enjoy!"
5,recommend for anyone who wants to show love to your mate,"This book is not just theoretical, or case study material, but practical and useful information on showing and receiving love, as given and received by people. The author explains and then gives advice on how you can show love so your mate will feel loved. Great book !"
4,The 5 Love Languages,"I am really looking forward to reading this book! A very close friend recommended it very highly. Just the title alone captured my attention. I've learned a lot in life, but this is definitely new territory for even me! Being able to communicate to the one you love, and understanding their responses is critical to making the relationship work."
1,The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment,"This is an excellent book everyone should read it. It will help any relationship, and even gives tips on how to define you love language. This is a must read for the younger generation as well as the ""mature"" generation."
2,"good book, not great shipping","This is a good read for any Christian who is about to be married. However, when it arrived it wasn't in very good condition. It was mailed in what looked like a brown bag that had been folded over and taped. Not much protection on the corners, so when it arrived it was bent pretty badly. I wouldn't have cared had it not been a gift. May have arrived a bit nicer had it been in a bubble wrap envelope or a hard cardboard envelope. I would probably order from them again if it was just for myself to read."
1,Totally useless,My ex (note ex)and I went to a marrage counselor and she recommended this book. It resulted with him buying me things (gift giving) and asking if I needed anything at the store (acts of service). My ex was very content thinking he was following the book and making things better and it gave him the excuse to avoid the real problems. Neither the counselor or my ex listened to the real issues and couldn't understand why things wern't getting better. People should raise their standards and not marry anyone who doesn't know the ridiculous basics in this book....be nice. It kept us from getting to the real issues but I had nice gifts by the time I'd had enough and left.
1,INCOMPLETE PRODUCTION,I ORDERED MULTIPLE COPIES FROM AMAZON. THIS BOOK IS MISSING AT LEAST 35 PAGES AND HAS DUPLICATES OF APPROX 40 OTHERS!!!
3,The book looks very cheap with large print,"It's a very good book. But, I was buying it as an engagement gift. The large print makes the book look very cheap. It may be OK if I am keeping it myself. But, as a gift, it is bad."
5,"If you are getting married, read this book!","This book was recommended by a friend. I would recommend it to anyone getting married, married, or just in a relationship."
4,A fun book to read and apply,It was fun to read this book and think about my own love language as well as figuring out my husband's.
4,This is great if you are really in love!,"I think this is a very good perspective and brings up issues that are not normally thought of. I feel that I could fall into any of the catagories depending how I am doing spiritually and emotionally that week.Another key to this is you must be deeply in love with the other person and be selfless enough to meet a need that is very hard for a person to meet naturally. If I like buying gifts, but my spouse just wants quality time when I an trying to bring home the bacon... we have conflict!I read ""Why Singles are not Married & the Married are Single"". This will make sure you end up with a person for the right reasons and then I think it would be easier to infiltrate the Five Love Languages into a solid relationship."
4,"Excellent, helpful book","I recently bought this book for my fiancee for Valentines Day because I thought it would be good for the both of us to read although I wasn't sure he actually would. He did read it, however, and found it very helpful and informative. I am now in the process of reading it and am enjoying the insights into how to truly express your love for the person you love. I would highly reccomend this book to couples!"
3,Good in Theory...,"This type of breakdown is good in theory and sounds so simple, but who is actually just one of the five? I certainly need/use all five of the love languages and have yet to determine just one love language in a partner. I suppose it is helpful to realize you may be not using one language, but I haven't noticed any difference in my relationships as a result. It's a fun (sort-of), self-indulgent sort of read and is definitely well-meaning, but like the king-warrior-lover-joker theories, and the essentialist Venus/Mars stuff, it is overly simplistic and fails to decode the complexity of human nature."
5,The Five Love Languages (Book),"Service was great, book came on time scheduled, will use this seller again. I recamend this seller if you are looking for good product.Books come completely protected and baged for cleanlyness."
5,A must read for any couple,If you are dating or marrried 50yrs this book will give insite on your relationship that you never had... A must read and share with friends and loveones.
4,Very Helpful,"I bought this book for my significant other and me to read together. Since we have both been married before I thought this would help our relationship start off on the right foot. I think the information is so practical and sounds so simple, but often we don't think in terms of what our partner considers acts of love. We often give love as we like to receive it, not imagining that they may not feel the same way. It is a good way to begin a meaningful conversation."
4,Not For Courting,"You can read about how wonderful this book is from everybody else, and I'm not discounting the book at all from what they said, but if you're Christian and courting your future-spouse, this book probably won't be too helpful. I'm not going to get into any religious debates, but I believe any serious Christian would court before marriage and that includes little to no physical contact before marriage. One of the most important things in this book is the quiz at the back with a bunch of questions that let you choose one method of affection over another. If you have never experienced physical affection, it is difficult to answer these questions and you'll find you can't accurately determine your love language(s).Good book if you're married, not so good if you're courting."
5,Great book - very helpful and easy to read,"My husband and I read this book on the advice of our marriage counselor. We'd been having trouble communicating and had both run out of patience not only with each other, but with our relationship. I think this book served as a great resource. It helped us to approach each other more thoughtfully and to have a better understanding of how and why we operate and react the way we do/have. Regardless of where you are in your life, be it happily married, dating, having marital problems etc., this book offers much needed guidance in managing your relationships with others - especially your partner. It is a quick read and totally worth the investment."
5,One of the most valuable tools I have for building a better relationship,"This is a very important subject that I feel every couple should look into. The ideas discussed in this book are simple and so basic. I bought this one for myself and the men's edition for my husband, so he would believe that it is really speaking to him. I hope he reads it."
5,The Five Love Languages,"This book was recommended by our pastor at church. My husband and I both read the book and refer back to it often. He actually finished reading the book before me. And while I was reading, he was over my shoulder reading along with me (his second time). Reading books like this open up communication in a relationship and in turn, opens up your heart to one another. Friends of ours were asking how and why we seem so happy these days and I would tell them it was because this book helped us become a happier couple together. Since then a number of our friends have borrowed my copy, read the book,and then bought their own copy for future reference. What a wonderful book this is! I'm now working on The Five Love Languages of Children and I love it as well. My 10 year old daughter reads it with me. Both of these books have been 'bonding' books; you read it with the one you love and it brings you so much closer! You can't go wrong with that!!"
5,"Brilliant! (And in plain English, too.)","This book is without a doubt the best resource available on communication in relationships. I was given the book by a good friend soon after my divorce two years ago, and I'm a changed person having read it. 'The Five Love Languages' is a must-have for couples whether or not you're experiencing problems in your relationship. To all my friends out there, you now know what you'll be getting from me for Christmas this year."
5,Great,"Great book. I highly recommend it. One of the best relationship books out there. A must read. It is a short, quick read."
4,Unbelievable simple yet so logical!,"Having trouble understanding your partner? Who doesn't? But Gary D. Chapman comes to the rescue and explains us how: The five love languages. It will help you understand why things are so cocked up at home. Simply because you don't do the things that the other partner want you to do. This book explains how you can identify what that mysterious thing is! And understand what it takes to please yourself as well. Finally I get proof for not being self-indulgant for always saying ""I only do the dishes because I love you"" (ok, that was before I bought a dishwasher, but anyway...)A much simpler theory and approach than the Mars and Venus books - a worthy complement. And easier to follow. It will not solve all your problems (like when we guys want to dig deep into our caves and run away for some time) but it is one hell of a good start!"
5,Good for Healthy and for Struggling Relationships,"I originally bought this book on a whim, and I'm really glad that I give into my impulses sometimes.This book is really helpful and easy to read. I didn't feel that my fiancee and I had any major issues, and I still don't feel that. But we still benefitted from this book.We found that we actually have the same love language. Though I doubt he'll ever actually read the book, I've discussed it with him and he said that he likes the ideas in the book as well.So, in my opinion, even if your relationship isn't in trouble, it's still a good idea to get this book. It might help you understand your spouse (and yourself) better."
3,Fake science,"This is a good read, but definitely not good science. If you're looking for an extended cosmo article, this is a good bet. My wife liked it more than me though."
3,easy reading,"this book was well written, easy to read and quickly gets to the point. With Christian fundamentals it's a bit hard to believe any love language is black and white which is sometimes how you feel when reading, but one should always look past the words and stories of others."
3,"""Helpful but Unromantic"" is right.","I agree with the reviewer who says this book is ""helpful but unromantic."" I can't express it as well as that review does, but I agree that Chapman is too critical of romantic love. He is also unrealistic about the ability of any two people to create it between them, simply by choice. I read recently the book that review recommends, Solomon's Song of Love, and find, too, that it is a healthier approach to romantic love. I intend to read C.S. Lewis' The Four Loves, too, which was also recommended."
3,More helpful to the very religious,Others will probably find as much or more in Deborah Tannen's You Just Don't Understand or in the relationship and communication sections of Richard O'Connor's Undoing Depression. Both of these have been lifesavers in our couples therapy. Maybe four stars for those who are not put off by so much message.
4,makes sense,Opens your eyes to things you should already know. If you listen to your spouse they will tell you their love language without even knowing about the 5 love languages. Reading this book just helped me to realize if you speak to your spouse's love language it will actually work. Good to refresh your memory and reaffirm what you already know.
4,A great read!!,"I enjoyed this book immensely. It provided me with realistic ideas and goals I could use in my marriage, AND with friends. It's an easy read..."
5,great book!,I really like the way this book is written. Good info on how to start paying more attention to your surroundings and identify the love language for yourself and your loved ones.
5,A book most often recommended to my marriage counseling clients.,"The basic premise of this book -- that people express their love and commitment to one another in different ways, which can easily be misunderstood -- is a most important realization. It's a simple concept, but to really apply it, to try to view your spouse differently and break-out of over learned patterns, especially in the ""heat of the moment,"" takes a concerted effort. The book is one to read and re-read in staying on-track, whether to replenish or to enhance feelings of commitment and intimacy in your marriage. I most highly recommend this book."
5,So much you don't know but should.,"My only regret is not having this book 39 years ago. My wife and I have a good marriage, but I expect the next 39 to be even better. Should be a must read for all newlyweds."
1,Restating the Obvious,"How someone get a book published in which he simply states what everyone already knows is just beyond me. For instance, Chapman tells us that some people (our partners, specifically) like to get compliments, like to have us do helpful and loving things, etc.So I'm skimming it, occasionally reading one of the examples of couples who misunderstand each other's ""love language.""But there's really not much work reading and certainly little that anyone with any awareness doesn't already know in this book."
5,Love your spouse the way they want to be loved!,"All of us who are married promised to love, honor, and cherish our spouse until ""death do us part"". The problem is that many of us do not know how to love our spouse the way they want to be loved. We naturally (and often incorrectly) presume that they want to be loved the same way that we want to be loved. This book, filled with practical advice and real life examples, will help you and your spouse to find out how each other would like to be loved. Reading the book and putting its advice into action is a great way to have a lifelong loving marriage!"
5,Best book on relationships I have ever read!,"This is a great book, both for evaluating how to improve your relationship with others (especially your spouse) and for improving your understanding of your own emotional needs and how to fulfill them in a healthy way. We have bought a lot of friends copies of this book!"
5,Wonderful and Enlightening,"I highly recommend this book to anyone, not just couples. It has helped me understand my friends and my friends to understand me. I have learned to interpret other languages so that I can see when my loved ones are telling me they love me, even when it's not my language. My parent's marriage was reformed by this book. My dad was speaking Greek and my mother was speaking Chinese. After reading this book, they started talking in the others language and it is wonderful to watch them love each other. I give this book to all my friends as wedding gifts now. Thanks Gary."
2,Nice stories but is it promoting dysfunction?,"It's nice to read about the experiences of others and find out that what we all go through is so similar (I guess!). However, I'm concerned that while the book gave me a nice fuzzy feeling, it didn't practically help me to get down to my own real issues. Meeting your partner's needs surely means that you're also catering to any existing dysfunction and failing to really address your own issues. Up to a point, this book is valid in terms of getting the balance right - enough quality time, appreciation, etc - but it's dealing with fairly superficial stuff. I still find that Olga Sheean's book is the only one that really cuts to the chase, and helps me deal with my own issues rather than simply observe and sympathize with those of others who have their own path.Fit for Love: Find Your Self and Your Perfect Mate"
5,book,"This is the fourth time I have bought this book. I was giving this book by a friend 4 years ago when my marriage was in a rocky period. Now I have giving this book to 6 different (sets) of friends, needed another one recently and all the others are either out on loan or forwarded onto others who enjoy it. Helped a great deal for myself, knowing myself, my other as well as many people I deal with, the concepts work everywhere. Highly recommend."
4,the five love languages,"Gary Chapman's theories and practice FEEL right. We can all benefit from using his ideas, what harm can it do to think about what your partner needs to feel loved and try it? Love this book and have bought copies for my friends and family (who also love it)"
4,I hate self help books. I'm not Christian. I love this book.,"It's a fast read and most importantly, it's a fast remember. Just when I'm about to assume that my boyfriend knows how much I care about him because we are CONSTANTLY together (I'm Quality Time) I remember that he's a Words of Affirmation Guy. So all I have to do is open my mouth and SAY what I'm thinking. We even jokingly ask how each other's love tanks are. I'm happy to report that they frequently overflow. It's an amazing little lesson in daily relationship maintenence - if it is too hard to use this system, you might want to rethink the relationship and find someone who naturally complements your language."
2,Cliche,"While the book did offer a few common sense statements about listening, communicating and interacting with your partner, it contained very few true insights. I found the writing to be full of cliches and general platitudes. Very ""dumbed down"" and almost insulting to the reader."
2,"Some good ideas, but too simplistic","The idea of love languages (basically, ways of expressing love) is useful, but in typical self-help style, the author makes it sound like this issue is the root cause of all marital difficulty. I think the book could have been condensed to article length... to sum it up, realize that the ways that you want to show love to your spouse may not be the ways that they want you to show love. Some people feel most loved when they get quality time, others feel most loved when you do acts of service (fixing things around the house, for example), and still others feel most loved through physical touch. Enough said."
5,"If you only ever buy one marriage book, buy this one!","I have read/bought a lot of of self help/marriage books, but this is one that I truly believe changed our marriage. We bought both books (this one and the one especially for husbands) and read through it together. It really changed our relationship (for the better) and made us understand each other in a completely new light. I give my HIGHEST recommendation for this book!!"
5,A must read for couples,"This book is a great book to understand other's view on how they percieve love. It explains there are basically 5 different types of love languages and gives examples of how to show love to a person with a particular love language. It is a short and easy read, divided into chapters making it convinient to reread any chapter/love language that pertains to you or your spouse."
4,"Great concept, but lots of fluff.","This could have been a feature article in a magazine with the test at the end, but it's a book with so much fluff that I ended up scanning a lot of it. Anyway, the idea of the ""love languages"" I believe has a lot of truth. I'm glad I read this book and I suppose if it will save some marriages it's worth going through the fluff."
5,Great Book!,Great way to increase communication with your spouse. Very useful insight that we really hadn't considered as ways to better our marriage. Awesome book!
5,I have a new marriage!!!!!!,"This book is wonderful!!!!! I have recommended it to so many women and i'm going to purchase it as gifts. I also recomend ""The 10 comandments of marriage"" Awsome!This book teaches me how to fulfill my husband needs without putting out so much unecessary effort:)"
5,GREAT book!,"This book is amazing! We received it as a wedding gift, and have since bought a copy for each of our friends getting married. You'll have so many ""ah-ha"" moments it's ridiculous!"
5,This book changes lives! For you AND your loved ones!,"Did you ever know in your heart that someone loved you, but you just didn't ""feel"" loved? And then he/she would do or say something that just made you feel like a million dollars!This book has happened upon a secret of the ages. Each of us ""feels"" love in different ways. We intuitively ""give"" love after the same fashion we like to ""receive"" love. Once you know each other's preferred style, you will glue them to you forever! It's an absolute guarantee!"
4,A lot to think about.,"This book gives you a lot to think about.You live with someone day to day but may never really think about what you are doing and the affect that it has on your loved ones. This book helps you look at your loved ones and decide what things that you could be doing to show your love. If you are thinking about getting married, it may help you to see the person in a new way that will stop future problems before they occur in your relationship."
4,Great book for couples,"My husband and I are going through this book with other couples. It has been very helpful! The copy we got did not include the study guide so if you want one with the study guide, make sure you look closely if you are buying online."
5,Simple yet definite truths that will help any marriage!,"I have seen constant demanding and condemning destroy our marriage. Although I know we still care a great deal for each other, we have done little to fill each other's love tanks. I now begin the experiment discussed in chapter 12 in hopes that the tide will be turned. I do this prayerfully and in hope. Regardless of the outcome of our marriage, I will continue to advise this book to my friends and relatives. These truths are just too obvious."
5,Men and Women CAN understand the Opposite sex! Wow!,"This book has changed my life and my perspective on all relationships! I used to wondering why I had certain responses, now I can figure things out! I have used these principles to understand my father, my mother, my finance, other family members and co-workers!What a book! A friend of my fathers recommended this book and my father (in his 60's) is recommending it to everyone. This is definitely in my top 10 list of books that have impacted and CHANGED my life. EVERYONE should read this book!I finally understand why I have the feelings that I have and why my friends and family respond and act the way they do! Wow! I can hardly wait to see all the wonderful blessings this book is going to bestow on everyone.Please read this book. It could save, salvage and improve every close relationship you have."
3,The Five Love Languages,So far so good. I'm still reading the book. It's taking me a long time b/c i don't want to breeze through the chapters. I'm putting into practice the advice Mr. Chapman is giving. Some things are hard to accept but i think it's worth it.
3,The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate,Very similar to men are from mars and women are from venus. This book is slow and I found the writing to be very elementary.
4,Great for self-reflection..,"I like learning more about my personality type as well as others' types. I am not currently in a relationship so I couldn't test this book out ""real-time"". However, the book contains a lot of thoughtful information that I will certainly keep in mind for future relationships. (Note: this book is helpful for familial relationships and friendships, too.)"
3,Unimpressed,"It's pretty simplistic, though logical and exactly what you'd expect by the title. I was hoping for something that would inspire me to think and perhaps teach me something new, but the points made in the book are just setting outlines/limits/definitions on anyone who was raised to respect the Golden Rule already knows."
5,Terrific advanced set!,"Compared to the rest of the Creator range, this set is more complicated, and considerably less forgiving of minor errors. It doesn't much matter if a brick in your Model Town House is one peg off spec, but an error in this Dino will either render it inoperable or cause it to fall flat on its snout.Once finished, this set is awesome! It amuses small children for hours, and completely freaks out pets. The core of the model is a very sturdy torso-and-legs structure which looks hilariously like a headless chicken. The dinosaur tail, head etc are essentially just cosmetic additions. Small children and small nervous dogs can tear off bits of the dinosaur shell, and the underlying chicken will keep right on going, rather like a Lego Terminator."
4,Great LEGO set.,"It's a great LEGO set. Had plenty of fun building the dinosaur and alligator forms (didn't try the spider form yet)!It looks pretty awesome once built. My only problem with it is the fact you can't really make, at least, the dinosaur and alligator form steer - It always walks or runs straight. But still had quite a bit of fun making it roar and walk around.Recommended."
3,Cool lego but remote doesn't work,"I bought this for my 8 year old. With a lot of help from his 13 year old sister, they put it all together and had a great time doing it. The end result toy looked really cool and moves smoothly. BUT, the remote control and/or robotics doesn't work! Very disappointing to the kids after spending two days putting it together. I tried everything I could to figure out the problem (double-checking new batteries, connections, etc) to no avail. Since it was so pricey largely in part because of the engine, I don't feel we got or money's worth with this lego.Also, they have three different toys you can make with it... which sounds cool, but once you build one, it is *very* difficult to pull apart all the little tiny pieces to make the next one. The kids said no way were they going to do that."
4,Great Lego Set for Older Kids,"This is a great Lego set for older kids. I think the age recommendation (9-12) is appropriate. Not so for some other Lego toys, like Bionicles. My kids were putting those together at age 4. This one is much more complicated to assemble, and my 12-year old asked me for help on a couple of sections.The only downside to this is that after all the hard work to get it put together, you don't want to take it apart to build something else. You almost need two or three to build each of the options!"
5,Ended my congestion woes!,"Since I've been pregnant the last couple of months, I've apparently developed a permanently stuffy nose. Not sure if it's swollen nasal passages, more mucous production, or both, but the end result is that I can't breathe through my nose at night and I'm always waking up with a sore throat.I was skeptically browsing for vaporizers (since a humidifier didn't help) and decided to try Breathe Right. Most people associate them with snoring; I had no idea of whether or not it could cut through congestion.Wow, does it! I can't believe how I'm breathing deeply through my nose again at night. No more sore throat, no more breathing discomfort. It holds my nasal passages open far enough that I'm able to breathe fine, despite the effects of the pregnancy.Out of all the nighttime pregnancy discomfort that I have to look forward to over the next several months, I'm completely thrilled that breathing difficulty won't be one of my issues!I highly recommend for nighttime congestion!"
2,Doesn't stay still,"I used this since I got it. it works( my husband said I didn't snored when I worn it, but it doesn't stay still to the morning, and it always peels off at midnight sometimes I have to change three times before I go to bed. I thought it was my night cream caused it. but it wasn't. My husband bought one of other brand, and they never ever peel off during the sleeping. So I am going to return it when got the postage from this buyer. I don't think I would pay the shipping to ship back,because it didn't stay still.May"
4,Good.,"Good, but if you live near a Kroger, their generic brand is considerably less expensive and I like them much better. They don't stop snoring for me but allow for much easier breathing at night."
5,Top of the line !,Best realtor book I've read so far ... Andd I've read 5 ! He goes into details about everything . I would recommend this book to anyone looking in to go into real estate ! ( :
5,A Handbook For Any Realtor!,This book is worth every penny! Should be part of any agent's required reading. Darryl has a unique view on how to help agents become less dependant on personality and more focused on how to help clients achieve their goals. It's fresh and a very easy read. I am buying a couple more so I can give them to agents I work with. Don't let your experience stop you from reading this book. Good for all! Thanks Darryl for this great tool and business workbook.
2,manipulation,"This book is full of salesman scripts and manipulation. I was disappointed in the book. I dont think the days of just being honest are totally gone and I dont think you should have to have a script to answer your clients every questions, Why not just tell them the truth??? The book had a couple of good prospecting ideas and was somewhat motivating, but all in all it's a good book for a used car salesman."
5,How to Become a Power Agent in Real Estate,"Great Book, a must for seasoned and new agents. The dialogues are invaluable for knowing how to talk to prospects and clients. Buy it, will be the best money you have invested in yourself."
4,New agent info,this is a good book for a new agent to read. it has the basic fundamentals needed to earn an income in our real estate industry.If you have been an agent for the past year of more and are not doing these things you better read the book.
2,Meh...,"I got this for my wife. Over a year ago. She hasn't made anything out of it yet, so I can't judge the quality of the projects. So if you are looking for a scrap quilting book for your wife that will really suck her into the world of scrap quilting, I can't really recommend this one. Buy her a copy of Skyrim instead. It's awesome."
4,Silent Giants,"Twins, Quest and Quaysar Ramsey head the Ramsey Group in Seattle Washington and are known among their female employees as ""the gods"". Quest, 3 minutes older than his brother is considered the stick in the mud and protector of the family secrets. Michaela ""Mick"" Sellars is sent to do a book on the family; however, once Quest sets his sights on Mick, the book is almost forgotten until Mick is asked to investigate a murder that might involve Quest and end their growing relationship.Quest and Mick's story was an enjoyable read and although I am looking forward to reading Quay's story and hoping to find out what happened to Sera Black, I also hope that Ms Washington will keep up the good work and keep them coming."
2,FRESH AND NEW APPROACH,"ALTONYA, I HAVE TO HAND IT TO YOU GIRL. I HAVE BEEN READING ROMANCE NOVELS FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. I LIKE HOW YOU HAD EACH MICHAELA AND QUEST INDIVIDUAL STRENGTHS WORKING BEFORE THEY MET. FOR A MINUTE THERE I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HAVE STRANGLE ""MICK"" BUT YOU LET THE READER KNOW WHERE SHE WAS COMING FROM AND UNDERSTOOD HER VEWS. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE QUAY'S STORY"
4,Loved it!! - Reviewed by Cassandra Durham for 3RW- Real Readers Real Words Facebook online bookclub,"Wow, I loved it. This book was recomended by the members of 3RW- real Readers-Real Words an Facebook bookclub, who were surprised that I had not read this series. Michaela `Mick' Sellers, goes to Seattle to meet with the famed Ramsey twins ( who have been described as chocolate gods because of thier sexiness) to discuss writing and autiobiography of thier family. Once she gets there she finds resistence of some of the family members. She winds up staying in Seattle for quite a while and falling in love with Quest. I loved how this couple built a relationship instead of just falling in the bed together. Cant wait to start on the next one."
4,Team Quest and Quaysar!!!,"I must say that I'm a huge fan of series... for one, I hate to see a book end...This is definitely one book that i can't wait to indulge in..and I will be adding this to my favorites...Quest and Quaysar Ramsey...Hottness! To give you an idea of how good this book was...I started it last night and just finished...this was the first thing on my mind after getting a little over 4 hours of sleep lol..."
4,good true crime book,I really did like this book. All I read is true crime. This book is very interesting and I could not put it down. I highly recommend it!!
4,Real Greek Cooking,"I bought this little book while in Greece. It truly is Greek cooking, not altered. The recipes are authentic, exactly as done in Greece. Being a small book, look for quality, not the quantity of recipes!"
1,The True reveiw of Bratz Dolls,I don't like the Bratz tresures because there wearing REALLY skimpy clothes and they are teaching kids to dress like that and possibly the kids will act like the Bratz look like which ISN't good.
4,I love it!,"M'kay. First off, I would like to make a point to all ye Bratz bashers/Bratz basher bashers. This is a place to give your opinion. This isn't a place to argue and take sides and get spastic. I admit, there's always that user that gets in your face, just let it be. Believe me. I've had countless stories of mean, disrespectfl people. I promise, keeping a zipped lip pays off. =)Now, I'm (finally :P) going to talk about the doll. This is prolly one of the best Bratz out on the market. It may be *kinda* exposing, but it really isn't over-the-top. I loff playing with it. The colours contrast perfectly, and she's got that hint of daring (that can be found in most pirates :D). I gave it 4 stars, with no doubt in my mind. Enjoy it!"
3,Essay,Nothing special - needed it for class.Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
1,riding Dave's coattails,"This book was horrible. Well written? Are you kidding me? The book written by his brother Dave was a success and it was an incredible book... this book; however, was just a literary train wreck."
1,TOTAL DISSAPONTMENT--DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!!,"All Richard Pelzer is doing is hanging on his brother coat tails. Yes, he was abused, but not at ALL, OR EVEN CLOSE to the extent of his brother Dave, in which he took extreme pleasure in and caused much of the abuse that took place. Then he has the audacity to say 'poor me'!!!! His poor account of his own so called abuse sounded like he was making up the accounts up as he wrote the book. Reading this book nauseated me and I am disappointed I spent any $ purchasing this piece of trash. His 'abuse' was minute in relation to David Pelzer. These two men should not even be compared, then or now! He is only trying to gain notoriety off of his brother. What a poor excuse of a man!"
3,"Very good book,",I thought this was a good book but just kinda ended no expalnation or the rest of his time or present life.
5,Great book,"I read other reviews before buying this book, which made me hesitate. However, I thought the book was well done. I did not compare and contrast the book to his brothers which I have also read. If you can read the book for the story he tells and take a lesson from it and not judge or compare this author to his brother you will hopefully find it as moving. I applaud the author for being able to tell his story. Hopefully it has helped him heal into a spectacular adult. I would not hesiate to recommend this book."
2,Following his brothers footsteps,I read all of David's books and was very moved..however Richard's seemed to hit alot of the same incidents..in either case I can't believe no one ever spoke up to help..I do feel David's books were better written .. I feel bad anyone would have to go through life as they did.. I wouldn't pass this book as I feel it almost reads the same as David's
1,Not a good read,"I was interested to find this book, to see what the author had to say about his childhood after I had already read the 3 books that his brother Dave Pelzer had wrote. And this book basically was crying out for readers to feel sorry for him, although his brother Dave who was treated like an animal by his parents and his brother who mind you wrote this book. I was not impressed with this book or his writing. I do not recommend this book at all, but I do recommend you look for his brother Dave Pelzer books, A child called It and 2 others."
4,Different perspective than his brother David's,I have read all of David Peltzer's books. This was different even though it talks a lot about the abuse the brother suffered after David was removed. It also talks about his understanding of his brothers abuse and his roll he played in it. Just a personal note; as a foster parent myself I don't understand why all the children were not removed from this women.
3,Slow,Half the book seems apologetic towards Dave pelzers a child called it. Overall I don't think I'd run out to buy the book again...
5,Excellent book for your grill learning!,"This book is well done. With very good layout on tips and information, leading to a successful learnig experience for your barbecue and grilling chores in the back yard. Chef Mike, adds loads of recipes.The book covers everything from tools, tips, cooking times and plenty of information for you increase your knowledge in this cooking art.Book covers alot of grilling info, not all about smoking, but still a good book."
5,No fancy pictures Just endless recipes.,"Hey why do you buy a recipe book. The recipes! This has them... Bunches of them.Sure sometimes a picture is good to show you how a fancy dish is to be presented, but hey we all know how to present a slab of ribs - right!Great list of rubs, sauces and short explanations. The only BBQ book you'll ever need. Wish I would have bought this one first. It will be the last bbq recipe book I'll ever need."
4,Good reference book for smoking and grilling,"When I first purchased my smoker grill I found I needed plenty of ideas for seasonings for various types of meat. The price was right, it had good reviews and I found it helpful for my needs."
4,Happy with book,Bought the book and the wife read it. It appears to have a lot of good information and recipies. ?(spelling)?
2,Did anyone test the recipes?,"Looking at the recipe for honey mustard sauce, it's just 2 cups of each ingredient. Seems a little suspect. I tried it in a smaller quantity and it's terrible. And I like honey mustard.2 stars for giving an overview of types of BBQ by region."
2,Did not really like ...,"Book lacked excitement.... Did nothing for me... every once in awhile I'll look through it, but better books are out there."
5,This book is so cool!,"Ok, I don't say this about too many, but this book is simply awesome!Describes the ministry of Jesus through one of His closest disciples, Peter, the fisherman.I've often wondered as I read the Bible how Peter felt when he did things like walk on the water or denied Christ. We always think of Peter as ""The great Peter!"", but he was as human as any of us and this book brings that out in an unforgetable drama. I wasn't able to put it down the first time I read it, and it's still holds a thrill for me.Makes a great gift for all ages!"
5,Amazing!,This book is amazing. I enjoy Biblical Fiction but this book has forever changed my view of Christ and his interaction with man. Thought provoking and poignant. I plan on buying several copies and giving them away especially to my Lay Pastor group.
2,way too small,"Be aware, these figures come apart in several pieces and the pieces are incredibly tiny. We have had them for about a week and both have pieces missing already. For the week we had them, i spent all my time putting them back together as my son was able to pull them apart by himself but not snap them back together. Now, he is just upset everytime he tries to play with them because Rodney's leg fell down a heating vent and the location of Fender's arm is unknown. I would recommend one of the action figures that do not have interchangeable parts over this. And, i think the price is unreasonable for the size and quality of the toy."
4,Cute little handheld,"I bought this for my nine year old at Christmas. She loved it. It is easy to learn the controls and to play. They can personalize the outside with included stickers. And of course, if you buy the TV console, it shows up on the TV in color. Cute!"
5,It's great but having problems,"I bought this game for my daughter's 8 year old birthday..in March 07 the golden retriever. She loves it and plays with it everyday. But not until we got the chiuahua for my son did we discover that my daughters game is defective.. the sound effects don't work.. the t.v., radio, squeaky toys etc. don't make any noise. My son's game does these noises. We sent it off to the manufacturer and they responded rather quickly we got a new game within the next week but it too is defective. So we have shipped it off to them again in hopes that we will get one that works. Or else its just a bust... get the Chihuahua not the Golden Retriever. My daughter is ver disappointed."
4,"I think it's more of a young adult, grown up thing",It's a 'virtual pet'. It's cool that you just pick it up for a few minutes whenever you want. Kids may not like it as much because they can obsess on a toy until they quickly get bored. Grown ups can dig it's Irony. It's silly and fun. I use it while I'm commuting on the bus in silent mode. The console is kinda cool and worth using occasionally. You can do few more things with it.
1,Short term novelty-don't bother!,MY KIDS LIKE THE COMMERCIAL. ASKED FOR IT FOR X-MAS. GOT A BETTER PRICE THROUGH AMAZON BUT STILL THINK IT IS NOT WORTH IT. IT IS A GIFT THEY PLAY WITH FOR A WEEK AND NEVER LOOK AT IT AGAIN!
2,Ready to Use Chidren's Bookmarks Review,"Although these bookmarks depict scenes significant to childhood, I do not think their presentation is very kid friendly. The colors are not bright or cheerful, and the pictures have an old fashioned quality to them. These bookmarks are definitely more appropriate for an adult audience. Nonetheless, a booklet of 30 is certainly a bargain for the price. In addition, the format of the book makes for easy use of the bookmarks thanks to the perforated pop out edges."
5,Robert Larsons oil and sharpening kit.,"This item was impossible to obtain in the Central Florida area. I needed to sharpen and lubricate several Swiss Army Knives that I collect. It was wonderful to be able to obtain it from Amazon.com. Now I have my knives well sharpened and lubricated to use. The servicefrom Amazon.com was great and the product was great also. Thank you from a satisfied customer, [...]"
5,Gracioso pero sobre todo inteligente.,Gracioso pero sobre todo inteligente. Cane es una escritora virtuosa. El libro tiene cualidades muy graciosas que lo hace muy entretenido. La parte más importante y fascinante del libro es la sabiduría. La sabiduría practica de cómo pasar por la vida siendo perezoso pero sin fracasar es magnifica.
5,Not really a toy -more for collectors or decoration,"This is really a neat idea for those Justice League fans. I suppose you could use them as toys, but they're really more for just sitting on a dresser to look ""cool."" They're quite heavy and very detailed, so you wouldn't want one thrown at anyone! Be sure to get the set to decorate a child's room, or for the collector. Very high on the coolness factor! Recommend!"
5,Insanely Funny. Also just insane.,"After watching Hamlet 2, I now feel 100% less raped in the face. Sexy Jesus is rocking me, and I'm working on my swimmer's bod.I got this movie for $4. How can you go wrong? Even if you just get it for the sing-a-long, it's worth it."
4,Random!,"This movie was extremely random, I watch it when my mind is destroyed after finals. Random laughs but other than that the movie was not too clever but very funny and stupid."
4,jezuz efing christ!,"At first, as the movie developed i thought, not gonna happen....It almost started to look look even worse, like most teen flicks....Then it immediately got cool thanks to Mexican actors who broke through the stereotypes to make fun of the racism that exists in minds of the white minority in modern day arizona.The authorities do their best to destroy the musical within the movie, and of course the authorities are white.The irreverent attitude toward christianity should not bother most of the folks that would watch this movie because you probably are at most, agnostic anyways and probably have seen a lot worse....and enjoyed it.It works, it's funny but had been cut up in such a way that it jumped forward too quickly, leaves me wanting better development of characters.by the way, roller skates, not roller blades....2 thumbs up, 8 of 10 starsworth your time"
4,funny irreverent comedy,"Not one for the kids or for anyone who takes religion too seriously. Steve Coogan is hilarious and the musical numbers will leave your sides hurting from laughing so hard. Catherine Keener, Amy Poehler, and Elizabeth Shue are great too."
5,very funny,Good humorous movie especially if you are a English or drama teacher. Steve Coogan is quite funny and the story almost seems plausible.
1,Stupid in a bad way,"The Bottom Line:Hamlet 2 is one of those movies that you watch expecting to laugh but end up waiting anxiously for the laughs that never come, faking a chuckle here and there but just getting more and more disappointed; by no means should you EVER spend money or time on this terrible piece of filmmaking that boasted a clever title and winning trailer (enough to get me into theatres) but delivers nothing at all in the way of laughs.1.5/4"
5,Hilarious movie!,I am a comedy movie person and watching this I have gotten to the point that I have the signs memorized. GREAT MOVIE!!!
2,It was disappointing.,"It was fairly boring. I watched it nearly to the end, then gave up. I didn't watch it all at the same time, either. It just didn't hold my attention."
3,Hamlet 2 - Audience 1 - A Close Call,"""High School Musical"" was never like this.Drama teacher Dana Marschz aims to avert school budget cuts in the arts by staging his self-written play, ""Hamlet 2"" using his polyglot class The movie is campy to an extreme.It makes little sense but, if you can suspend your disbelief for 90 minutes, you may be rewarded with a few chuckles. The latter include the show-stopping tunes, ""Raped in the Face"" and ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus."" Local authorities protest, the ACLU steps in and the movie has a farcical climax during the play's production in an abandoned warehouse.The Bard might have been bored by this sequel. It's so bizarre that you may not be."
2,Ridiculous -,"Dana Marschz, a failed actor, who is now a high school drama teacher/coach.Dana still has the ambition of doing a success and comes up with a plan to do sequel to Shakespeare's Hamlet ""Hamlet 2"". However, this is a musical and is to be done on a grand scale. Dana becomes creative and casts a wide net to recruit transfer students for key roles. Rehearsals soon cause school officials and community members to object to what he is doing. Dana will not let his dream die and goes on despite the roadblocks.Dana keeps going on, he will not be denied the freedom of artistic expression, ""to thine own self be true."" Support from the ACLU sprouts, and ACLU attorney Cricket Feldstein (Amy Poehler) works with him and his favorite actress Elisabeth Shue (plays herself).Overall the film is so ridiculous; it does get a few laughs in the last scene. It is a story of optimism and focusing on a goal, however nutty."
2,I bought this movie because...,"This really is a bad movie, although kind of fun in a schodenfroid sort of way. I bought it to do a mini-doc on it as parts of it were filmed in my friend's home. I really love Steve Coogan, he's a comic genius, but his talents were wasted on this wacko character. Oh, and theAlbuquerque Gay Men's Chorus was a hoot too!"
5,The truth about beautiful Kate,"Beautiful Kate is a film that starts innocently and progresses towards discovering shocking family truth.The Australian cast in this movie is first class with Bryan Brown, Ben Mendelsohn, and Rachel Griffiths.The cinema-photography is superb, and Rachel Ward provides a carefully constructed film that may challenge some viewers with themes that are immoral, but these past deeds must be addressed to provide closure.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
5,review of Beautiful Kate,I think this is the best film to come out of Australia since the heady days of Gallipoli and Breaker Morant. Ben Mendelsohn is in his best role ever and deserves more international recognition.
2,Disturbing,"Very sad situation. Definitely filmed to show a family isolated, but I'm sorry - isolation does not mean that you can't leave."
4,Memory Stick Reader,The product works as specified. Makes it really easy to load images without having to hook up my camera and run down the batteries. Great value.
4,The State Of New York VS Derek Murphy,"My only complaint is that this wasn't a full length LP. It left me wanting so much more. I would and still continue to, play this a couple times back to back. It never sounds dated or played out (to my ears) and its everything you can expect from one of Hip Hops Finest. A+"
4,gift of gabber goes hardcore in style,"Somehow I have never been able to feel artists, who sing about the hard knock life. I have always preffered The one Love, Mos Def, stuff to the Big L stuff. But some how this album works REALY well. The whimsical sound of this artists voice (featured on SoundBombing 2) combined with the DJ Preimire like soundtrack makes up for the gangster flavor. This album has depth rarely heard in 90s rap music. If You like hardcore, underground or any Rawkus stuff, Buy this album right now !!!!Peace"
4,It is an OK book,"For those who have money and live in a castle, they will love it. For people who love a relaxed atmosphere I recommend English country style by Julie Fowler. It is no a bad book, only the cover page is more promising than the rest of the pictures in the book. It is all very Victorian."
3,Great for the beginner,"If you are just starting to decorate the small places in your home like table tops etc.. and need some help with great ideas this is the perfect book. That is if you love antiques and the classic type things. If your stlyle is modern, woodsy, etc.. this book would not be of help."
5,Outstanding!,"If you have gotten the idea that this is a 350-page frolic of tall tales, then be assured that it's much more than that. This first-person account tells of the last days of the open range cowboy, the great blizzard of '87, racial hatred, and a diabolical plot to start a second Civil War. That's not a spoiler, as you find it all out on the first page! A page-turner deluxe, with great insight, humor and ultra-smmoth writing. Plus, there's a nice loose end that could (I hope!) lead to a sequel. Absolutely A++."
3,"Pacifiers are okay, but...","My son has been using these pacifiers since he was born, and he enjoys them. There are a couple of exceptions:#1) My son had a tendency to push the pacifier out of his mouth with his tongue quite often, resulting in him being very frustrated an unhappy.#2) Just recently (my son is now 25 weeks of age), he inserted his own pacifier into his mouth incorrectly (cock-eyed) and the pacifier wound up STUCK INSIDE HIS MOUTH. He could not close his mouth and the pacifier was very close to the back of his throat.These are just a couple of things to consider."
3,"Okay, but Not Quiet","I bought this humidifier for my son's room, primarily because my Voronado was having a qlitch (fixed - LOVE my Voronado!) and it was less expensive and said ""quiet."" Now, I am not sure who thought this was a quiet humidifier, compared to turbine engines it could be considered quiet, but nothing close to the quiet of my Voronado.It does do the job of humidifing the room, and I like the digital setting for the percent humidity. It is easy to refill, and it does make a great white noise machine for sleeping - if you don't mind the loud noise."
4,Serves its purpose,"This humidifier works quite well, is easy to operate, and not bad to clean. It comes apart easily enough and cleaning takes very little time. We go through a tank full of water each day on the lowest setting. Unfortunately, it is a little noisy, so its turned off at night. The noise isn't so noticeable during the day. We're all breathing easier though, so I'm glad for the purchase."
3,Reasonable choice,"Agree, it's not that quiet, but not as noisy as a hunter humidifier I tried. Easy to take apart & fill. Have to soak filter in sink full of water every day for a few seconds, which is a nuisance. But otherwise a low maintenance item. Base never seems to get dirty (unlike my Hunter), & the filter lasts 2-3 months. As far as capacity, it's adequate for my very large master bedroom (about 12 x 22) with a cathedral ceiling."
1,Don't buy this product,"After about a week of using the humidifier..the fan stopped working.I tried to return it to Amazon but their buyer would not accept it back because I openend the package. I called Honeywell and they tried to help me fix it over the phone, but could not. I ended up having to ship it back to Honeywell and paid $20.00 for shipping! I am still waiting to get the replacement after a month. Also, you can not refill in your bathroom sink becasue of the way the water tank is designed. It goes on/off during the night depending on the humidity in the room, which would wake us up.We will have to see how the replacement is...From now on, I will only buy products that are ""fragile"" in a store where I can exchange or return it directly to the buyer without having to pay shipping cost."
4,"Not quiet, but otherwise quite good","Although the ""QuietCare"" name is a joke, the HCM650 is a good humidifier, and we have found that it's benefits outweigh the noise, especially if you turn it down to low or medium at night. The tank is large enough to keep it running for about 24 hours, and we highly recommend using filtered (or distilled) water instead of plain tap water to keep the filter from getting clogged with mineral deposits. Even so, you should expect to replace the filter every 3-6 weeks, so be sure to buy some HAC-504 replacement filters so you won't run out."
2,Broke within 6 months; hard to fill & move around,"I am very disappointed with this product. It is less than six months old and has stopped working (and we only used it occasionally, usually when someone in the family had a cold). I will now have to send it back to Honeywell at my own cost and wait 4-6 weeks for a replacement - not brilliant.It worked fine when it did work, and I liked the different settings which helped to ensure that the room was moist without being overly damp. However, it is also hard to fill and/or move without getting water all over the floor (and yes, I do follow the instructions and empty it before moving etc!). It's also quite bulky."
5,Great Buy!,"I already had a 3 gal Honeywell for my bedroom and needed something a little bit bigger for my living room. This unit is wonderful! I can fill it up with water and set the fan, humidity and time and walk away. And it came with a cool little cleaning ball. I love both my Honeywell's and would highly recommend them!"
5,Honeywell-HCM650 4 Gall QuietCare Cool Moisure Humidifier,"Love this product. I use a 2 humidifiers year round, 24/7 due to asthma triggered by hot dry air. Many reviewers have complained about the fan noise. It is not ultrasonic so it does have a fan. However, the fan is a smooth noise with three settings, and the humidistat works 100 times better than the one on my former Bionaire humidifier. It is much quieter than the Bionaire and it works quickly. That means the fan comes on, puts out needed moisture and then turns off as soon as your desired humidity setting is reached. It doesn't turn off and on every 15 seconds like the annoying Bionaire did. Very little cleaning required with Protec and filtered H20 (no minerals) water. In short, It is much quieter and MUCH more efficient than other top brands I've used. Also less expensive. As soon as my other Bionaire goes, I will buy this one again from Amazon."
2,Only lasted one year,"Had many humidifiers over the years, and this one was OK, until the fan just went out, and I discovered that it only lasted for one year."
1,"Horrendous, inaccurate digital controls","The digital controls on this humidifier went haywire. One second, it read the room humidity level as 65%, the next second it was 85%. This humidifier will not turn on if the humidity level is more than 65%. The air in my apartment is so dry; there is no just no way that the humidity level is anywhere close to 65%, let alone 85%. There is no way to manually control the humidity output. I had throw this piece of junk out along with the multiple filters I purchased for it. My suggestion for you - buy a humidifier without filters and without digital controls. Buy one with only manual controls that you can adjust. Sometimes ""sophisticated technology"" is not necessarily a good thing, and it's true in this case. Simple is better. The humidifier, when it worked, also had invisible mist. I just prefer the visible cool mist, so that's what I will buy next. I already threw this junk in the trash."
4,nice lil humidifier,"For the pricing one, would be hard pressed to find as good of a fan based humidifier in the same price range. I have long been a fan of the honeywell brand, and when our older model humidifier gave up the ghost, I certainly wanted to stay with Honeywell. Yes the fan makes noise...but it is a fan and that is generally what they do. I did not find it overly louder than a small desk fan on low."
3,"It works, but it is really, REALLY, R E A L L Y loud","If you're accustomed to the heating/steaming variety, you'll find this to be incredibly loud. I don't have a decibel meter but even on the lowest ""quietest"" setting the fan is extremely loud. This model has what is essentially a big sponge that soaks up the water, and the fan blows over it. The fan is really loud. Did I mention how loud it is?"
2,works well when it works,"I had this humidifer for 2 years and the motor went bad w/ the bearings. It started slowly making screechin noises and than went bad finally one day. I was going to buy a different kind but found the upper part for $55 and for that price thought just get it again. Well here I am today ordering another one for the same price and it's been bout 2 years again or so. Same story w/ the motor happen. I would buy a different kind but figure for the price of it to get again, WTH. Filters are $8-10 each and that isn't that bad I don't think. All in all it works really well when it works, and i'm constantly filling it which is good cause that says it is working."
4,Honeywell Humidifier,I did a lot of research before buying this and I feel that it is a good buy. I love the variable speeds and adjustable levels for humidity. It is also very quiet running. The only thing that I would complain about is that it blows out the front instead of top. You have to place it where no one is in direct line of air flow. The air is very cold and you can feel it a good 10 feet away. I just have to watch where I place it. The tank holds plenty of water and usually lasts 2 days. I am very happy with it and would recommend it.
4,Humidifier Review,"A quiet, efficient piece of equipment thus far. It's MUCH too soon, however, to comment on it's durability and thus as to whether it was, or was not a wise purchase. I would have liked to have had more information on this latter point (durability) prior to purchase."
4,Solid Choice,"Definitely not the quietest unit, however, it puts out much more moisture than three other humidifiers I own (I believe the 4 gal per day output). It will empty it's tank in a night if it's really dry. That means the humidity control is doing it's job. As far as mold goes, I just douse the filter with water when I'm filling up the tank and I have had no mold issues. The specs for all my humidifiers (Honeywell, Holmes, Vicks) say change the filter every thirty days so I don't think this is necessarily a knock on this unit. You may get 6 weeks out of it but I would want to change it anyway by then."
3,wet and not quiet,"I have high hopes for Honeywell products. This model is not a model i would buy again. 1. it is not quiet 2. if you need to move it, it will leak 3. mold starts to grow on the air filter within the first month."
2,Quiet... NOT! Stopped working after 1 night,"This was fortunately a present and a gift receipt was enclosed. QuietCare? My 2 month old wakes up when it starts running. Cool Moisture - well it's cool alright to the point where it's freezing in my room. In fairness, air quality in the room improved and I know the water in the tank has been dispensed in the air. I was willing to work with this then it stopped working!I'm sure lucky this was a gift and a receipt was available."
2,Noisy & cold,This was a replacement for my warm mist humidifier. It is soooo noisy. You can't sit anywhere near it as it send out a jet stream of cold air. It's like sitting in front of an open window on a winter day. I would have never bought this product. I don't recommend it to anyone.
1,Beware of Mold!,"I just threw this item away after finding the filter clogged with hairy, dirty, black and green mold again! I changed the little bulb that is supposed to prevent mold and the filter often. Each time I changed the filter, I found it clogged with mold!I have never had a problem with mold with any of the warm mist humidifiers I have used for years. This was just plain awful."
1,Need three hands to fill,"The water tank is poorly designed. One can not set the inverted tank (thats how it needs to be to be filled) on any surface as the tank's top surface is not flat. So one has to hold the thank w/ both hands or prop it up somehow and fill the water. As the water fills, the balancing act becomes more difficult because the center of gravity rises. Stay away."
3,So-so,"It's a bit loud but seems ok for it's price. Haven't had the need to change the filter till now, but when it comes time to change the filter I may need to reconsider continuing to use this humidifier."
2,Too noisy ....,"I bought this humidifier after looking into several review and several options. I read that this model is laud, but cant believe that so much.I will never buy those type of humidifiers and suggest everyone to look into devices which work using ultrasound."
3,leaky and moldy humidifier,"I agree with the other reviews I have read concerning this Honeywell humidifier. We have to replace the filter much more frequently than we had anticipated, and there is a pervasive moldy smell after only a few weeks of use. I have noticed that if I soak the filter in water everyday (as the manual recommends) the product works better, but I feel that mold is growing too rapidly anyway. We live in Queens, NYC, and have hard water and crazy heat in our apt. We need the humidifier to keep out kids noses from drying out, so we use it daily. Thankfully, the filters on Amazon are much cheaper than on the Kaz website. We bought the product at Bestbuy and they don't even stock the filters! I do feel that the humidifier is noisier than promised, but that doesn't bother me. The mold growth bothers me-and I even use the Protec antibacterial cartridge!"
1,Noisy,"I've just bought this product less than 2 weeks ago. Did not use it that much because it's very very noisy and that's the lowest level. If you set to high level, you won't be able to hear anything. Plus, it blows very strongly. Feel like you sit in the car with window open."
1,Too loud for bedroom!,Don't get it if you are using it in the bedroom. There are others that operate almost silent.
4,Big Bow Case,"This case is great for packing all your hunting equipment and clothing. The construction of the case is not as strong as other cases, but for the price this is great for people that do not want to spend a lot of money. This case is the same size as the single plano bow-max bow case. The only difference is that both sides are fully padded with a corrugated plastic board to divided the bows. The case includes a small plano organizer case which is secured inside and has the ability to hold another plano organizer case. This is not the most secured and padded bow case. You get what you pay for."
4,Great For Younger Girls,I bought this for my 4 year old niece and she likes it a lot. The price was right when I bought it (about half price). It is very big and has a lot of pages of blank paper and paper with barbie scenes to be painted and/or colored. There were even pages with barbie pics that could be colored and cut into paper dolls. I gave this four stars intead of five because the scissors were very cheap and because I don't think this would be very entertaining for the age range listed. I wouldn't purchase this for any child over 6.
2,freebie,"I've always loved a good animal story, but this is a so so read. Being a childrens book, I found the wording difficult to follow and the characters unbelievable. Basic plot of doing good no matter how hard it is, will benefit in the end. Good thing it was free!"
3,Just like other standard. Nothing special.,"Most student have been exposed to QM at the undergrad level through Griffiths text. If you are one of them, then I do not see a reason to buy this book. I bought it then returned it a couple of days later. I think this text is just as Griffiths one but still more verbose at many points and with less examples. 3 stars because it is OK and nothing more."
3,pepcid,"It works better than Tums, but not as well as pepcid complete, but for some reson I am unable to find any Pepcid Complete. So I will continue to use Pepcid and Tums together for heartburn until I can find Pepcid complete again."
5,Pepcid...,"I ordered a box from this company and at that time I initially reviewed that I was very pleased with the the shipping and service I received.After 22 days, I can say - the product is exactly what it is (no mis-package representation)and the product is the ""real deal"". It saves me trips to the local store (which is 1 mile away) but the price is too much and it saves me a trip to a local ""big savings discount store"" which they don't carry the larger box size anymore at an equitable price.If I can continue to receive the timely shipping, good service and good pricing - I'll continue to order from them."
3,It's ok but not has good as zegerid otc,If you have mild heartburn fine but if have severe heartburn i would go with zegerid otc it is much better and works right away
3,Can a generic be inferior?,"I had been mostly using PEPCID AC max (20 mg)for a few years. I did also use, off and on, a generic from CVS but thought it didn't work quite so well . . . could this be? I recently bought a generic at Walmart's for a terrific price. I've had off and on some GI problems in recent months, and rather a lot over the last couple of weeks. Currently I'm looking at lactose intolerance. Looking at the labels I see no lactose in the PEPCID product but some in the generic (in the inactive product section). I'm surprised that the small amount that probably is in the generic product would cause a noticeable problem but in any case at the moment I'm doing some experimenting. Have any other users of PEPCID had a problem using the generic?"
5,"I gave this product to my mother, who ...","I gave this product to my mother, who suffers from heartburn almost daily. She says that Pepcid AC is her favorite product on the market. It gives her quick relief and she can take it anytime, before her heartburn sets in or after it's already started. Knowing that it's helped her, I'd definitely recommend it."
3,Cute plate,"I purchased this plate for my grandson, and it is very cute, but I think it was way too expensive. I would not spend so much money again for this item."
5,Emily Green,"These are the most well made, darling plates I have ever seen! Durable as they are cute, this makes the perfect first birthday gift! Make sure you get the Imagination Mat as a follow up for their second birthday!"
1,Why didn't someone warn me?,"When I picked up this book, I was looking forward to a good book to read. My first impressions are obviously wrong. I seriously wish my friends didn't recommend this book to me, because I didn't like it at all. It's sick and so detailed that I wanted to hurl. Normally sexual themes don't bother me as much, but when she describes a form of incest...I wish someone told me earlier, and that people didn't recomment 5 stars for a book knowing that other people wouldn't enjoy it as much."
3,Not up to McKinley's standard...,"Robin McKinley's book, Deerskin, is not up to her usual standard. It does not have as much appeal and allure as the plots of ""The Blue Sword"" and ""The Hero and the Crown"".The book focuses on Lissar, a beautiful and motherless princess. Her father, the king, rapes and beats her. She then flees into the woods with her dog Ash. She escapes into another city, where she hides among these people.It was more written as a rape recovery book than as a fantasy; however, it gave a realistic view to Lissar's traumatic experience. McKinley did not seem to make an effort to give depth to Lissar, which made it extremely hard to get into the book. Even through the bad parts, you could still tell it was McKinley's writing. At times it was even interesting. The only thing that made this book into a fantasy was the appearance of a dragon half way through the book and Lissar's many transformations.All in all, disappointing. Still worth the read, but please also read her other books."
2,Very disapointing,I really enjoyed 'Hero and The Crown' and 'Blue Sword' so I was really looking foward to reading this book. It was a big let down. I kept hoping it would improve but it never did. The writing was lifeless and dull. The plot was depressing and confusing and dragged on. She throws in a somewhat happy ending but the book still seemed dark.
3,Haunting faerie tale with a twist,"I have always been a fan of stories that retell well-known faerie tales. This one, although the story isn't well-known, is bound to become one to anyone that reads this book. It is vague in parts, but all in all, if you haven't ever read any of Robin McKinley's books, this one will get you hooked!"
5,A stunning book for grownups,"I've recently finished reading Deerskin for perhaps the fifth time. I find I need to re-read it every year or so, to re-charge my soul and my imagination. I'm not an incest survivor -- just a survivor of life, and this book speaks to the courage we all must summon to get through our personal adventures. The writing is stunning; the character development subtle and convincing, and the plot is seamless, with the rhythm of a fairy tale and the details of a fine painting. I've read as many of her books, now, as I can find, and my fervent hope is that she keeps on writing for the next hundred years! We need her work."
4,A compelling fantasy for people who read serious fiction.,"As an incest survivor, I have read many books which attempted to address the issue and did so flatly or exploitatively. This is one of only two books that spoke truth to me, and did so within a lush, intricate, completely involving story.I was changed by my reading of it, and I am irked by the online reviews that complain the book is ""too"" dark,especially the one that rants about ""pseudo-psychology"" and ""victimhood."" As someone who has experienced this kind of pain, I will vouch that there is not a grain of trendy incest exploitation here.I do not normally read fantasy; I don't consider the best quality writing, But this book stands out."
5,a GOOD book,"i would deffinitly have to say this is one of my faveorite books, it has romance, adventure, and much more!"
3,It was OK,"I have to admit I wasn't impressed by this work of Robin McKinley's. She has done much better things such as Rose Daughter and Beauty . I skimmed quite a bit of the text as the descriptions went on and on. Not much conversation takes place in the novel either (which can make it seem extremely long at points). Some have criticized the main character saying she is flat and that the romance in the book does not have any dynamism. I, however, would disagree with this assessment. Lissar changes a great deal throughout the traumatic experiences of her life--her neglected childhood, being raped by her father, her near death experience, and the time that she spent in Ossin's kingdom. However, with the slow pace of the novel I think this book is less likely to attract first time readers to her work."
2,Not McKinley's best. . .,"I was not pleased with ""Deerskin."" Like all of McKinley's novels, the fantasy element was well-developed, but I disliked the dark side that she showed in this novel. Her other books were excellent fantasy that could be read and recommended to younger readers, but still held the interest of adults. Fantasy doesn't have to be ugly, but it definitely shows an unpleasant face in this book!"
2,"Boring, modern psychobabble","For a so-called fantasy setting there sure was a lot of modern day psychobabble. Superficial and tedious writing, and contrived turns of plot (oh, amnesia as well as a miscarriage!). This book isn't entertaining and it's a poor account of recovery from rape."
4,Initially frustrating; improves on second reading,"Lissar is annoyingly insipid in the early going; this improves later. McKinley's characterization of Ash rings far more true than the depiction of Lissar (I still can't connect with the early Lissar!) and the book becomes more and more engrossing. On the second read, the flaws are more easily forgiven"
4,"Well, I'm not Kirkus Reviews","""From Kirkus ReviewsA first foray into adult fantasy for the author of such well- received children's books as The Outlaws of Sherwood (1988), etc... Turgid, lurid, soporific fluff. Might have made an adequate fairy tale at a twentieth of the bulk. McKinley will have to do much better than this to capture an adult audience...""...just an obscure voice on the InterToobs and a guy that used to get paid to write stuff- a ""perfessional writer..."" I like it well enough that I'm still reading the paperback and sent a request for a Kindle edition. The lady has a nice way with words.-30-backhoe"
3,"Not too good, but not bad either.","While I wouldn't go so far as to say this book was excellent, I would have no qualms about giving it to children just because of the incest themes. Stories like these can be very helpful to kids who've been molested by a parental figure. Children who are fortunate enough not to have had this experience should still know that it exists, and a folktale is an excellent way to bring it to their attention."
4,worthy of attention,"This book is thoughtful and effective. The story is heartwrenching and the plot is straightforward. There are a few instances when the author's wording makes the story a little confusing, but overall the storyline is clear. This book is not outstanding, but definately worthwhile."
1,"I wanted to like it, but...","...I just couldn't or didn't. I am a long-time fan of Robin McKinley, as I began reading her books in the mid-80s, and always wished she would write just a little faster. Her book BEAUTY remains one of my favorite novels. I bought DEERSKIN with expectation of loving it as much as all of her other books. Instead I thought ""yuck!"" and only finished it to see what happened in the end. For whatever reason, the language did not enthrall me, I did not connect with the characters, and the story-line bored me. I have since sold my copy of DEERSKIN to a local used bookstore."
2,Caution,"As an educator who reads books normally with the thought of sharing them with children (i.e., purchasing them for my classroom library), I found this book to be unsuitable for innocent consumption.Morbidly fascinating, yes. Uplifting or enlightening, no.It should at least come with a warning on the cover."
1,Awful!,"This book is about a horrible subject and gives no enlightenment. I looked to Robin Mckinley to give a bit of escape and was left with such a horrible feeling that I doubt that I will read her again. She was a good writer, but seems now to be getting into the darker side of life. Read her earlier works and leave this one alone!"
5,TEENAGERS! DO NOT BE TURNED OFF!,"I read Deerskin for the first time at the age of 14. Yes, it was disturbing and my heart beat quickened at those certain parts, but I still found it the best of McKinely. Sure, it deals with topics that people would call Rated R, but just because you are not an adult I do not see any reason that it is not fit to read. It is reality. We must learn that the world is not a sugary sweet faery tale! It is my most favorite book, all of my friends who read it also found it theirs. It was a compelling, stunning book and I would recommend it to any teenager looking for a book that they will place in their special library. It is dark but has beautiful messages that are exciting to find. NO, it is not for your 9 year old daughter. But anyone over 13 who is mature enough to deal with these topics, read and enjoy! You will not be sorry!"
4,A fairy tale...but not for the kiddies.,"A re-telling of Perrault's ""Donkeyskin,"" with elements of the Grimms' ""Cinderella""? If only it were so simple. ""Deerskin"" is sick, twisted, and disturbing; it is emphatically *not* for children (or even less mature adults). But it's also deep, gripping, and beautifully written.McKinley obviously likes animals every bit as much as her protagonists; the ubiquitous dogs are strong supporting characters in their own right. And although the characters may seem at first glance like fairytale stereotypes (the evil king, the exiled princess, the honorable prince), they break the mold in original and intriguing ways. (The prince, for example, is shy, pudgy, not particularly handsome, and would rather spend his time romping with puppies than attending a royal ball.)"
5,A Tragic Story....,"I am a big fan of McKinley works, especially The Blue Sword and The Hero and the Crown. But this book has to be one of my favorite books of all time. Contrary to many other reviews her actual lack of personality is what makes me feel so sorry for Lissar. The way she was brought up in her parents shadow never actually allowed her to develop one. I loved how the only reason she kept on going was because of her love for her dog Ash. I am 18 now, and first read this book when I was 12. I know this book is not for everyone, some people like to read perfection and happy happiness (not that I am adverse to it, I like to read a happy happy story sometimes too!), still, all in all, it made me cry, it made me feel, which I think is the point."
4,Deerskin by Robin Mckinley,I thought the book Deerskin was good very well written and not the typical book you normally read. It was very different but a good different but then I am partial to Robin Mckinley books. It had a good story line and though confusing in parts very good i loved it!
2,Where was the editor?,"This book should have been sliced down to approximately 1/3 of its length. Why make a bloated, plodding novel out of what might have been a tight, compelling novelette? There were 100-page long sections so uneventful and monotonous in tone that reading them was a punishment. I skimmed the last third--picking out and reading the pages upon which something actually happened took less than 15 minutes. And what happened in that last third was artlessly overdone melodrama. Even if you are a connoisseur of re-written fairy tales (as I am), you would be better off skipping this one. However, those who are obsessed with greyhounds and enjoy reading endlessly repetitive paeons to their beauty might find the book unexpectedly satisfying."
2,Not worth it,"If you're looking at this because you're a fan of the other McKinley books, I'd skip it. It has a disturbing rape scene at the beginning & is definetly not for children. I am willing to read things like that if the story is worth it, but I didn't think it went anywhere or was interesting. I'm a huge fan of Robin McKinley but I threw this book away."
2,Boring and Dull,"I read this book because I have read several others by Robin McKinley and loved them. The only way to describe this book is bizarre. The ending makes no sense at all, and in fact, none of the book makes any sense. I don't understand it all. The story line doesn't capture the imagination. It became a chore to read the book. She has white hair after the ""Moonwoman"" changed her hair color, why? Then she regains it after she confronts her father, why? Why does she even confront her father? Then there is about ten pages of blood, light, crying, etc. After the end, I had no clue what had just happend. .... Ms. McKinley was trying to make the book interesting to adult readers and failed. Stick to the books she wrote for children!"
3,Are you sure McKinley wrote this?,"I adore McKinley but I wasn't overly fond of Deerskin. If you have read other McKinley books, tread softly here... her writing style is completely different in this book.There are WAY too many loose ends and not enough substance in the story. I had to keep re-reading paragraphs because they didn't make sense. This book is not ""dark"" as a lot of reviewers claim. In fact, I found it rather dull and lacking.I read all the reviews prior to ordering the book... I wish I would have paid closer attention to the negative reviews."
5,Beautiful and Haunting- A lucky find!,"I randomly bought this book at a used book store and wasn't expecting much of it. The beautiful cover art grabbed my attention, and after the first few pages, I couldn't put it down. I've never read a story quite like this one. Beauty and tragedy never seemed so perfect together, in the literary sense. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a sweet and short fiction novel. Deerskin is well-written and surprisingly captivating for a book that is less-known. There is a nice balance between the development of the plot and character. The story is also graced with fantastic plot twists and a satisfying, if not perfect, ending."
2,Don't let the title fool you,"This book verges on scary in its heavy reality-based content designed to help you decide to have a baby (or not). If you already know you want to get pregnant, and are just looking for guidelines on the healthiest, smartest way to do it, stay away from this book. It will not psych you up or make you feel good."
4,Useful for considering pregnancy,"I have been looking everywhere for a book that covers issues you might want to consider when just thinking about ""do I have a baby or not?"". Although, like many conception books, this focused heavily on the how to conceive part, almost half of it discussed issues to be aware of when trying to decide ""should I have a baby?"" and ""if so, when is best""."
2,No new info,This book didn't really give me any new information...The way it's written is VERY boring. Never finished reading it all the way
1,A rip off,"I strongly recommend AGAINST buying this book.At 9x6, 110 pages, this is an awefully little book. It contains about 21 pages of text, and in the rest of the book are 162 black and white photographs.The text is over simplified, with only seven references listed at the end. While this may be good enough to pass as a chaptor in a more comprehensive textbook, its merit doesn't justify as a stand alone book.The photos are of very poor quality. By ""poor quality"" I mean both unclear (low contrast, grainy) and lack of illustrative value (what man with his right mind would demonstrate ""cherry red"" color in black and white? But the authors apparently think that's a good idea).I would classify this book as a $3.99 ""pulp science"". Buy it and you'll regret it. You have been warned..."
4,Another stellar offering from Polyphony Press,"With ""The Thing About Second Chances Is...,"" the folks at Polyphony Press prove that the excellence of ""The Thing About Love Is..."" was not a fluke. Comprised of another diverse group of writers, ""Second Chances"" explores the universally appealing ""What if?"" factor. There's no fluff here; instead you'll find a fascinating combination of anguish and joy that is utterly human. As it would be inappropriate to point out my personal favorites from the book, I will say that some pieces held a stronger appeal for me than others, but that each piece has something to offer. The second chances covered are suprising in their creativity, and with a mix of poetry, short stories, a screen play and a stage play, there should be a little something to meet every preference. I invite you to find your own favorites."
3,Ehh,"The product does exactly as its suppose to do. Sticks to the wall. The bunny part has no controls so its a one setting fits all. On top of that, its a turn on by closing , no button start. When you put it on the wall you have to line it up with the bunny. Wouldn't buy this product over again."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this toy thinking it would be fun. It didn't stick to anything for very long, ESPECIALLY when I tried to use it. It would just pop right off and fall down. I tried several times and several ways to use it, looking up different sites just to be sure I wasn't using it incorrectly, but it still killed my orgasm or made it really dull every time I tried using it. I wouldn't recommend."
4,Remixed,"Single to Beck's popular 'Where It's At' from Odelay. A great song with some fun remixes, my personal favorite is 'Lloyd Price Express' mix. Hard to find so if you stumble upon it and it's not too expensive, give it a try.Warning note: If buying this single used online from Wherehouse music, be careful. I tried to order it and they just sent me a copy of Mutations. When I tried to give it back to them and correct the problem they never actually sent me the single I ordered."
5,Great collection of poems,"Stephen Dunn is a wonderful contemporary poet. His poems are witty, sublime and sometimes humorous. This is a quick read, but a also a must read."
3,"Sturdy gun, broke after 10 shots","The gun itself is pretty strong, but it must have inner parts made of glass because after 10 or so shots it completely stopped working. not only that, but the spring in the one clip they sent with the gun stuck at the bottom and wouldnt push any bb's out. hmmm.. i think 75 bucks is a little too much for this one."
4,BE Sniper Rifle,"This gun is very high quality, with a solid feel. If the extended barrel is attached, it is only supported by a thin piece of plastic on the inside (just a warning). The iron sights on top can be removed easily to make room for a better scope. The gun only comes with a 40 round clip, but high capacity magazines can be easily bought. The one problem I ran into was with the gearbox. On of the contacts was bent downward so that the gun wouldn't fire. Once this was fixed, the gun ran like a charm. Take good care of it, and it be a worthwhile investment."
1,don't buy this product,It worked for about 60 shots. some system on the inside broke. don't buy this product. I had it for a day before it broke. to all airsoft players out there. this is a warning. do not buy Chinese made products. They generally work as well as any 3 dollar airsoft gun you buy. I stopped playing airsoft. because I spent over 400 dollars on airsoft guns. wouldn't suggest buying airsoft at all. paintball would be a better route to take. if you have a problem with your weapon witch generally doesnt happen unless you have to replace an o ring (25 cents to replace). you can get them fixed. unlike airsoft. dont get me wrong. if your not looking to spend much money on ammo for a shooting sport airsoft is the route. but make sure to buy a very expensive airsoft gun or c02 airsoft gun for as little problems as possible. make sure you can return them also.
5,AMAZING!,"I got this for my 2 year old daughter, in a size 2 color white, and it fits perfectly on her!! The item got to me in 3 days! Fast shipping and such a beautiful dress! She will be wearing it for my wedding and I AM so happy with the dress. The price is great and the dress is even better. It looks like an expensive dress and I can't wait for our guests to be surprised with the price!"
3,"Too much sex, not enough mystery",This is one of Tami's earlier books and she really hadn't got the mystery genre yet. The whole story was too wishy washy.Book was received in good condition.
1,Lucky's Lady,"Tami Hoag used to be good writer. Over the years I have read and enjoyed 8 of her books. They had suspense, intrigue, and intricate plot twists, with a reasonable amount of sex and passion thrown in for flavor. This book, unfortunately, is just the opposite. It is all lust and sex with barely enough plot to hold it together. Then she tries to give it some cultural value with a handfull of cajun French phrases and a few paragraphs about the difference from European French. So, if you are looking for a Harlequin-type formula romance with an unfulfilled woman who is rescued and bedded by a super macho man, this is for you. If, however, you want a spine tingler suspense novel, you might want to go elsewhere."
1,Claptrap,"Tami Hoag has written some well-crafted mystery novels and she should stay with this genre. I read Lucky's Lady after reading Ashes to Ashes and Guilty as Sin, both of which I enjoyed. Sad to say, Lucky's Lady is the kind of book one would expect a sex-starved housewife to purchase in a super market. The plot is shallow and predictable form the start; the sex scenes seem to occurr every other page to the point of complete boredom."
1,Trash from a Great Mystery Writer,"I picked this up at a book exchange because I have thoroughly enjoyed Tami Hoag mysteries such as ""Ashes to Ashes"" and ""Dust to Dust"". Luck's Lady was just trash. It is cliche-ridden, with a totally predictable plot. The stereotypes of the silent, troubled, macho, hero and the beautiful, smart, good, educated and successful blond with an evil twin are trite and hackneyed. I almost thought this book was a joke by a good suspense writer. There is no suspense or surprise in this. The love scenes are more funny than erotic. There is no redeeming value to this book!"
2,Like watching a soap opera...,"This is the second Tami Hoag book I've read and most probably the last. To be fair, I am not a romance novel reader, so my review may be slanted. Lucky's Lady was recommended by a friend so I bought it.It was very difficult to get past the first few pages because of the really laughable lines, but I stuck with it to give the book a chance. Amazingly enough, I finished the book. Sadly, it was overly predictable, with a bit too much ""lust"" in it. Every time Lucky and Serena got together, I thought ""oh please...not again...just get on with the story!"" Had Tami Hoag left out some of the ""manly essence"" stuff and concentrated more on the story, it could have been a good book.Bottom line, I felt like I was watching a soap opera with really corny dialog. And the last two lines of the book actually made me LOL. I've given it two stars because I was able to finish it quickly, and overall, the silliness of it all made me laugh. So I guess there is value in that."
2,Not as good as her other works,"I have read many of her other books and enjoyed them. This was just a romance novel, not much plot. I enjoy her detective novels and find the relationships in those to be more compelling because the characters have common interests and goals to bring them together. This time it just seemed like the 'kissing parts' were the reason for the book and the sibling rivalry plot was there to facilitate the kissing."
2,a complete disappointment,"Let me start off by saying how much I enjoyed Tami Hoag's other books. I have bought and read almost all of them now, and kept them .... except for this one and Magic. I gave both away (with appropriate warnings) immediately after I finished them.The main female character Serena is a psychotherapist returning home to her family. We see her deal with various characters and situations and she comes across as very weak emotionally, awful at dealing with other people (especially her family), and wonderful at deluding herself. The tortured hero is just too tormented and appears only as a cliche. Unfortunately he comes across as just this side of sane (and that's only if the wind is blowing in the right direction). Lots happening in the story but much of it is predictable, rather like watching a B-grade movie.A disappointment from such a talented writer. I can only imagine that this was one of her very early works."
5,Best Love Story Ever!,"I am what you would call a ""hopeless romantic"" and despite the fact that I always said I would not read trashy romance novels, I somehow managed to get into them. My friend gave me this book and I have to say out of all the romance novels I have read this is by far the best....I love all of Tami Hoags novels and I think this work is her finest. I would reccomend this to all the hopeless romantics out there...its a great beach book!"
3,My Review: Lucky's Lady by Tami Hoag,"I picked this book of at a ""free to a good home"" pile at the Ronald McDonald House. I picked it up to read while sitting at the hospital with my sister. I enjoyed the book, and quickly got to a point where I couldn't pit it down. It went quickly, and was a great book."
5,Still my favorite,"I've read Lucky's Lady at least a dozen times over the years and it's still my favorite. Just the right amount of romance, suspense and a Hero to the rescue. It maybe old but it's a classic romance that I will cherish always. Side note: This is my second copy of Lucky's Lady my first book has been read so many times its falling apart!"
1,here's my issue with this book,"I know the area that she writes about in her book, and the description of it is completely made up. She writes about the african american people like they are aliens from outer space. No one talks like that or looks like that. It was offensive. I wasn't crazy about the story but after reading it I decided to become a writer because if this lady can make it as a writer, I know I can. But it's basically crap."
3,It's ok ...,"I have read almost all of the ""series"" books that Tami Hoag has written. Lucky's Lady was more of a romance novel rather that Tami's usual murder/thriller. It was an ok read, but I would rather read a thriller instead of one that is so ""mushy""."
3,Entertaining,"Lucky's Lady by Tami Hoag is a mystery within a love story or a love story within a mystery depending on where you are in the book. The story wraps around the Bayou, or the bayou wraps around the story, again, it depends on how far in you are. The characters grow along with the tale and love blooms side by side with a multitude of nefarious plots.Even though this is one of the author's early suspense novels, it has some of the same riveting qualities that permeate most her later work. There is a steadily building sense of tension though out and though I enjoyed the love story I was unhappy with the mystery's ending. It was not a question of justice, but of endangering innocents that could suffer in the future. Being caught up in a bad situation and making poor choices is different from setting out deliberately to do something bad."
5,"Beautifully written! Exciting, intoxicating, suspensful!","I could not put this book down! I felt like I was in the story myself. Tami Hoag always does a super job with descriptions. It has suspense, romance (great romance), greed, etc. I will probably read this book again. I wish she would write some other books like this one. Of coarse, I love every book she has ever written."
2,"simply more ""dumbing down"" of literacy.","An obvious pot-boiler, this ""Meg""-a-flop uses every poorly contrived method in the author's grab-bag to grind out a 200+ page piece of trivia.At least Kirkus Reviews correctly names the site of all the breathless action...it's Marianas Trench, not Mariana TrenchHey, if the author could not even give a correct location then I suppose he can be forgiven for not giving us something more than mediocrity"
2,MEG: A novel of unintended laughter,Much to silly and the author is way too green. The plot is so far out that you can't get into it because you can't believe it. It's more like a goofy short story than was puffed up to a novel size with large print and plenty of chapters
4,Not bad but the writing needs to be improved,"Very creative but the writer could be more careful not to repeat the same or similar information again and again in dialogues or most paragraphs. Readers who liked this book, for advanced and more mature readings, please check out No.205 of Amazon.com 500, THE UNIVERSE BELOW-Discovering The Secrets of The Deep Sea, and most of Clive Cussler's deep sea adventures, such as NIGHT PROBE! and others"
2,The writing is very raw;Disney might transform it better?,"If you could read it not so blindly with just a little bit consciousness, you might find this book's plots and scenarios leaked like a sift! This is a very green writer not only short of consistancy and talent but always struggling even in dialogue writing. But this book's editing and printing were pretty smart: Dividing a not-so-long story with many chapters and balooned it up to 277 pages for a higher sale price! Such editing also made it very easy to read. Very very Smart editing! If the publisher could do so, no wonder the writer could make a 20 tons Megalodon sink a 8,000(+-) tons sub, and shot all the print-outs around him by a Megaprinter"
4,A Thrill ride that will keep you reading.,"What happens when man discovers a prehistoric Shark living in the deep ocean? Well, what else, we try to catch it and put it on display! But that cannot be an easy task can it? Of course not. That is what makes MEG such a fun read.There is a thrill a minute as this book unfolds and there are some great action sections that are described in great detail. All in all MEG delivered on all fronts, an exciting easy read that makes you want to keep going.I will highly recommend this book!"
2,I Need Glasses,I was a few pages into this when I realized Steve Allen didn't write this! What a mess! I can't believe how silly and poorly written this is. Brain-rotting junk. I'm going to get glasses and a copy of Mr. Allen's latest!
1,Un-original with poor creativity!,"(two half stars- one for the un-originality, and one for the repetitiveness!)No doubt a first time novelist here! Interesting beginning and some good gore, but it's straight downhill from there. Very predictable, ""hollywood"" action with a struggling plot and frustrating disbelief. Oh, by the way- one terrible ending! I wish the damn fish would have eaten Steven Alten (do not stray again from physical therapy, or whatever your professional career is)! It made me sad to see such a great creature destroyed by such a poor author."
3,needs suspense!!!!!!!!!!,"As with most first books, its fairly lame. The only good guy eaten kills it! Plus megalodon only apeared 20 million years ago, not 70! However, it is a good book for a starting author. Entertaining, but not a ""novel of deep terror."""
3,"dislike it by all means, but for the right reasons!",So what if Alten doesn't know jack squat about marine biology? There's nothing wrong with novels being the product of one's imagination. The only problem with Meg - unfortunately a big problem - is that Alten can't write. Amazing (and sad) how the in-flight reading crowd considers this to be a completely irrelevant flaw!
3,predictable yet entertaining,"I enjoyed this book for a couple of reasons. First, I considered a ""quick-read""--not laden with gobs of research or anything. It didn't take long to finish. Secondly, after reading the first couple chapters I basically predicted 90% of the book's later events...and that's good and bad, I guess. If not ruined in screenplay form like Michael Crichton's ""Congo"" was, this could be an entertaining movie."
5,A fantastic book that keeps you gripped in its jaws!,This book is a great read foer all thriller lovers. It is full of suspense and what makes it all the more interesting is the thought that it could happen. The characters are well developed and although the ending is over the top it doesn't let you down. It should be made into a film as it would crush Godzilla and have the same excitment as Jurassic Park.
4,"Good book, not a great book, but it was a good book.","I have to say that I did enjoy reading Meg. I know that years ago when I first read Jaws I turned the last page and felt that I would not be able to go on if I did not find out what happened next. That was not the case with Meg. Jonas was not the most likeable character in the world. How long was his mourning period over his recently eaten wife? Ten minutes...maybe. However, the story moved quickly and the theory of this prehistoric shark actually existing gave me something to think about for a few days. I will probably read The Trench. Having read some of the other reviews for it on Amazon, it appears that some people think it was better than Meg."
3,Jurassic shark? not exactly.....,"Despite the fact that the novel has a fast-paced and somewhat exciting plot, the factual information is made up or stretched from page one. Carcharocles megalodon was never alive during the Mesozoic Era and evolved only about 30 million years ago. The teeth didn't get 8 inches long, the jaws only got about 7 feet in diameter, etc. The technology was misinterprated with incorrect info just as much. It seems as if the author did absolutely NO research into the topics he covered, making this novel a very uncredible read. Maybe if the information was CORRECT and the characters were developed more this would be a good read, but don't think you can throw away Jaws or Jurassic Park."
5,The Best Shark Novel Since Jaws,Excellent book it was gripping and powerful. The writing was fantastic and the suspense was as real as any I have ever felt reading a book. Disney must be crazy to pass up an opportunity like this. The movie would do killer at the box office ( no pun intended.)
3,What are you going to do??? Its his first book.,"Well as for a quick read, it sure is. As for interesting, possibly. As for making any major influence on me, definitely not. But it was interesting and kept me reading just to see what happened. Alten seems to have taken a good first step on hopefully a promising career, but if not there have been more shameful ""one hit wonders."""
2,Alten's Meg should have thought twice about surfacing,"Meg by Steve Alten is not very good. I give the author credit for his accurate information about the Carcharodon Megalodon and other undersea interests, but the problem comes from the fact that the characters are not very entertaining. I didn't find too much difference between this book and Jaws by Peter Benchley. However, for a first novel, Alten makes a fine attempt."
3,A good summer time read.,"I thought MEG was a decent book. If you want to read something that is entertaining, and nothing more, than MEG is the book you want."
3,What do you expect?,"I don't see why so many people are critizing this novel. It's not Steinbeck, it's not Shakespeare, it's a freakin' shark novel. You don't buy it to observe the author's masterful characterization (which, I have to admit, is a little lacking), you buy it to see a gigantic shark rip people apart! That's the purpose of any novel like this, except Jaws. That was good. But this, however, is a light, quick, adrenaline pumping ride best read at the beach. I recommend it only if you make sure not to take it very seriously."
2,Reads more like a comic book than a novel.,"Who wouldn't want to read about a giant shark thing. The plot had potential but was ruined by horrible writing, lame cliche's, and weak shallow characters. This is one of those books that relies on trite gimmicks to appeal to the masses. If you are in the mood for simple, mindless entertainment with no substance, then this book is for you."
2,Needs work.,"I liked this book a bit better than my husband did, but I felt the author had a problem with women. It starts out pretty good--at least as believeable as some of the others in the genre, but the end is awfully hard to 'swallow'. And Mr. Alten shouldn't try to put any romantic interest in his writing. It was weak to say the least. But I work the graveyard shift, and it was a good middle of the night read. It went fast and kept me awake. It's currently making the rounds at work, and once my unofficial personal opinion poll is complete, I'll let you know"
1,I hope the screenplay is better.,"I understand the author wrote this with the moviealready in mind. A movie about a very old andbig fish would make a great satire of the ""Jaws""movies, but they can't seriously use this story."
1,A serious suggestion to Disney & Doubleday,"Reading not only should give you fun but also should help improving your logic, common sense, and widening your knowledge. By reading scientific novels, it widens our vision for the future, and the fantansies would also make our imagination become more vivid. While the former also is a work of imagination, it won't give you an impression of absurdity, 'cause its premises would all be based upon somewhat logical and reasonable imagination. But not this book! If a 60-ton shark (called it a Meg simply not feasible) could push up the 3000 tons Kiku (chrysanthemum) in Monterey Bay; Jonas and DeMarco could crash the reinforced metal rails of the Kiku (a modern battleship made in USA), then Disney should only make this movie into a CARTOON! And the 2nd Edition of this book should be changed into a COMIC book! Then everything would be fine and more fun"
4,Recommended summer reading!,"I enjoyed this book very much, however, I would not recommend reading it at the beach as I did! A great read, couldn't wait to turn each page, the suspense mounting with each turn. It did seem a bit fantastical that Jonas could be swallowed whole inside his submersible, cut out her heart and survive, but hey, it's called FICTION! I highly recommend the book and look forward to the sequel, Just Imagine the MOVIE!!!!Cindy Smithprofiler1@msn.co"
1,are you people insane?,"After a couple of days of mind-numbing reading I had to put this book down for good last night with 50 pages remaining. I purchased this book based on the number of positive responses on this message board, and now I wonder what in the world so many of you were thinking? This book was terrible, hands down! Very unimaginative, predictable, and poorly written. I thought I was reading something written by a junior high student. Even outside of the shallow character development and unrealistic shark behavior, the shark sequences weren't even exciting. Shark reaches warmer water by swimming in other shark's blood; shark prefers eating puny, bony humans over large, fat whales (which were apparently very easy to kill); shark propels itself many feet out of water to get helicopter. Come on, please!"
1,"From the depths of the ocean, comes a novel so shallow....","In all honesty and sincerity, this is the worst book that I have ever taken the time to read. Sure, I knew it wasn't going to be a literary masterpiece that would endure time, but you've got to be kidding me. I am suprised to say the least that someone at the publisher signed off on this book and gave it the go ahead. I'm not sure if the characters in this book could be any less developed or shallow. The plot in MEG is really reaching even for those with a willing imagination. If this book is any indication of work to come in the future from Alten, I'll never read another one of his books."
1,Worthless crap,"Possibly one of the worst books I've read in a long time. It reads like a screenplay not because the author is obviously dim and talentless, as everyone seems to agree, but he is shrewd: the real BIG bucks are in the movie rights, and this one will probably break records. This story is written for people with limited minds and imagination -- and to that end I suppose it serves its purpose."
1,Biggest rip-off ever published,"Fortunately, I didn't buy this book with my own cash, but somebody gave it to me as a gift. Still, even for a free book, I couldn't believe how bad it was. When the major character carves his way out of a Megalodan stomach using a shark tooth I exploded with laughter. Talk about stupid, talk about unbelievable! I notice there is no paperback version forthcoming so for anyone wanting to read ""Meg"", check your local dump, because I threw mine in the trash. There should be a consumer rating for this book, only children 5 years and younger."
1,Mr. Alten can't write,"This is exactly the kind of book that makes some snobbish people think that thriller-horror & sci-fi books are trash. I was enticed by the idea and I aknowledge that the writer is genuinely in love with it, but, after all , this is a book and not a made-for-TV miniseries, so should be something more than a bunch of random action scenes with no real characters or substance. And the final part is totally ridicolous ! Above all, everything is presented with total absence of writing skills (the prologue! ) .I'd just save the part with the shark chasing the helicopter . You can read this early morning ,on a crowded subway car....."
2,"""A Novel of Deep Terror"" or DEEP ERROR?","Very attractive cover. WOW... Another proof not to judge the book by its cover. I must admit, the descriptions of the shark were somewhat amazing and we must at least give credit to the author for his outstanding job on researching the prehistoric shark known as Meg.Interesting beginning...that's all !!! Jurassic shark?? Not even close. The plot was terrible. A long extinct shark that for some reason stayed alive, gets to experience what it's like to be on the surface of the ocean, got the hang of it and kills everything in sight??? Possibly creative but I don't buy it. Very unrealistic. And how do you kill this tremendous, invincible Carcharodon Megalodon? Go inside it and rip its heart out. Ugh. Please!To make the book worse, the characters weren't developed, very predictable story line, and is fast paced. But if this is your kind of book, go ahead and see for yourself."
1,"Instant novel, just add water. Waste of time.","Computer software wrote this book. Add good guy name, add bad guy name, add vindictive wife name, add love interest name, add emotional interest name... etc. Hit CREATE ME A NOVEL! and in 5 minutes you would get this waste of a good concept.The Teletubbies are more mentally stimulating."
4,"good book, but the ending was weak","overall the book was good, but the ending was a bit weak... but hey, if you like sharks and suspension of dibelief... it's good for you. i'd recommend it."
5,The most exact book on sharks I have ever read,This book clearly had thought and idea placed into it. This was a new idea that seemed to catch alot of attention on readers and non-book readers alike. The tone of the book was dark and gloomy and how Steve Alten made the characters interact was just genius. I hope that the idea for Meg the movie can and will happen and that the same action and tone from the movie are done so that it will scare more people than Jaws ever did and ever will.
2,MEG short on plausible details...,"Good premise and fascinating subject, but was ruined by very poor research/advice about Navy operations, submarines and even something as simple as rank/rate for Navy characters. Too bad. One hour of conversation with a Navy veteran could have saved the author from a lot of mistakes."
1,Amateur Writing (being charitable),"MEG was a fast read, thankfully. The plotline has great potential that is never realized. The book is filled with characters that you never get to know, because the author never creates them in depth. It is filled with scientific and other errors of fact . . . errors not necessary to the story. The errors are very distracting and after awhile, you just read over them with an ""oh well"" attitude. It has been characterized by other reviewers as a good first book: I disagree. It is amateurish from page one, poorly researched, poorly peopled, --- well you get the idea. Compare this to Grisham's First Book and then say it is a good first effort. And it does not compare at all to Crichton (not even on the same scale with him) or Benchly. (If you really want to read a GOOD book about creatures from the past, read ESAU.) MEG is not worth your time unless there is nothing else. I have read worse, but I never finished them."
2,IT BITES!!!,"I was all set to write a scathing review, but after reading all the other nasty comments I almost feel sorry for this book. Almost. I gather that a movie is in the works, and the book reads exactly like a second-rate novelization of a cheezy movie. I would recommend it only to those trapped in broken elevators with no other books."
4,Exceptional plotline,"Meg is a very good idea for a book. Most of the theories behind it are pretty sound. There were a couple of necessary technical errors regarding some of the animals in the story [tyrannosaurs swam rather well, actually], but it's otherwise an intriguing concept. That's the main plot. The secondary plots were a bit weak, and Alten's writing style and I just didn't get along. For a first book, it was better than it could have been. I'd recommend it in any case. --Gremlin, www.gremlin.net"
5,#1Favorite,"This novel is neck and neck with Raptor Red as my favorite book. It is the PERFECT prehistoric terror since 65,000,000 years ago! Its true when I write it is full of the most realistic fealing in any book I've read. It deserves 6 stars! Signing out I am the #1 fan!"
3,Mind Candy with a Really Big Bite,"Alten keeps the origin of Meg in the story realistically possible. This was a fun Summer read with stock characters and a fish that would make Benchley blanche (or become totally translucent)! Part of the near ending is ""hard to swallow"" but I'll save cutting remarks for others. It was a fun book, definitely worth a ""fin."""
3,Alten's book is fun to read.,"The idea is great. A giant white shark a monster from the depths with great hunger and bad manners. Even thought the whole book is predictable and the story has big errors (the shark shouldn't glow in the dark, It doesn't need it. It's prey would escape at the sight of it) you can read it on a couple of hours and you can expect a great blockbuster from Disney. Just imagine a giant shark eating a T.REX!"
3,Great until the end,I really enjoyed this book for the most part. I loved the premise! I loved how it started off! I thought the characters were pretty well established. The book moves along at a great pace and the great shark is frighteneing. I would have given this book a solid 4 stars if it had a better ending. I won't ruin it for anyone but I just found the ending far fetched and a little silly. If this was a movie and it ended the same way I think people in the theatre would be laughing. Exciting fun book undone by a goofy ending.
2,Exciting. Silly ending.,"When I go on a long drive I look for a book on tape which is action oriented. That way, when I miss several paragraphs while looking for my turn, I don't really miss anything.This fits the bill nicely. It has a great monster.If I had bought the book I would have torn out the last twenty or thirty pages. The ending was totally ridiculous."
1,This book is an intellectual insult to all readers.,"I approached this book with great anticipation. I was not expecting first rate writing but I thought the story's premise was intriguing and anything had to be better than the latest Danielle Steele trash. Wrong. The story's premise was intriguing, the story line was not. The writing was unbelievably bad, the character development was non-existent, the dialogue was beyond stilted, the science was poor, the ending was...there are no words to adequately describe the sheer silliness of that ending. I cannot believe this guy got published. And where the heck was his editor? Readers should have the right to sue a publishing company for malpractice. Throw this fishy tale back"
4,Thriller,"I first read MEG: Primal Waters because I found it at work and it looked interesting. This compelled me to read the rest of the MEG series. I started with the download, which had a nice prequel story. I am only about half way through Deep Terror, but it's a page turner."
5,WHERE'S THE MOVIE?!?!?,"Excellent book, a real page turner. The thought of a 60 foot White shark in our modern day world wreaking havoc on unsuspecting people who have no idea of it's capabilities. I have to see this on film, talk about JAWS 2001! This would scare a whole new generation of people out of the water again! Very exciting book."
1,Doubleday got in my pocket,"Meg is a fine example of the publishing industry's trend towards apealing to the lowest common denominator. I don't know what scares me more, the fact that Doubleday reportedly paid 2.1 million dollars for this dog, or the number of people that rated this book over a 2 in Amazon's on line review. It will be some time before I consider buying anything published by Doubleday. Fool me once shame on you. ect."
1,Even the Japanese name was not correct!!!!!,"Dr. Simidu? What kind of Japanese name is this? In Japanese, there is only ""Sh"" instead of ""Si"" and ""Do"" for ""Du"". We should treat every book like a product that could be returned if it got too many defects. And this 'MEG' is just like one of the Black & Decker lousy products, once you turned it on, it suddenly burned out! There were so many defects on every page, I just could not totally melt into the story(if there is any). A published book is just like a consumer product, I should have the right to return it for a refund"
1,This book should be printed on more absorbent paper!,No doubt the factual errors sprayed throughout this work will pass right over the heads of the masses. A way out plot made unbelievable by an infantile author still struggling to understand simple constructs.A complete waste of time. Great for reading on the toilet
1,MEG,"This is the most ambitious and flawed book I have ever read. The plot is ridicoulos and the ending more far fetched than I could have ever possibly conceived. Surely, should this be translated to film then it will be a suitable companion to Jaws - The Revenge! If you love monster stories then you may enjoy this, but for me it lacked any real depth, pardon the pun. The charactertisation is practicaly non-existant, pretty much like the fish itself. This is on a plain with the vampire flick 'Fright Night' in that the character names - Peter Vincent - Jonas Taylor, being reminiscent of Jonah and the Whale and perhap Jon/Valerie Taylor , et al? One final point: Ok, when they die,sharks don't float but whales do: Testiment to how unplausible the author's theory really is. Afterall thats a HUGE bite radius! - But let's not spoil the fun."
1,Pure trash.,"I will keep it short and simple. This is the worst book I have ever read. Terrible dialogue, one dimensional characters, and the stupidest climax ever to grace paper. A waste of good trees."
2,"Interesting, but shallow.","I received this book as a present, and found it interesting. I wanted to know the fate of the meg, and learned about sharks and depths. The drawback for the book are the characters, that are shallow and based on stereotypes.This reminds me a little of some books by Science Fiction writer Stephen Baxter, with the good science and bad characters (Baxter's science AND characters are better than Alten's, though).I'd suggest you read the book as I did: When I had absolutely nothing else to do (or read). It's an average book."
3,"Great Idea, Little Suspense","This book has a great plot: a 60 foot version of a great white shark has surfaced from the Mariana Trench, and is eating everything in sight. Unfortunately, the book comes up a little short in creating a realistic approach to the story, and there's a lot of predictability. An example is that the hero searches for the Megalodon with a stolen helicopter. And the book seems to be poorly and sloppily put together, with almost no plot twists, which gives the book its predictability. And the ""utterly amazing climax"" also falls short of expectations. (The hero, named Jonas, goes into the sharks belly with a mini-sub and stabs the cardiac muscles to death. I dread Disney's recreation of this scene.) There is almost no suspense throughout the story so I have no idea how they got the idea of comparing it to Michael Crichton's thrillers, such as ""Sphere."" Despite this, ""Meg"" is a good read for those that like sci-fi and don't mind a lack of suspense."
4,A fun and quick read,This book is a quick and fun read. If you like sharks - this book is for you. Most chapters are only a few pages long making this an ideal read while waiting for the metro or before going to sleep. Get this book. Get books 2 and 3 because you'll want to keep reading.
3,"Dead, dead, dead","After only reading 2 of his novels, I began to realize that it seemed like in every chapter (I know this is pushing it) someone dies. It began to be funny. I knew not to trust anyone to continue thru the story. I did enjoy them, however, not that much of a turnoff. Give us a break, Steve."
3,It's ok; excellent story though,"This was a good story, and it did keep me interested throughout. However, when compared to other authors, Steve Alten is just average. He doesn't develop characters well, nor does he do a great job of telling the smaller stories within the main story. I'll probably get the sequels despite this."
5,"Better than JAWS, more action than Jurassic Park:","THE new action author. Buy the book, take it to the beach, and enjoy it for what it is, an action-packed page-turner that doesn't let up until the last page. Alten's weaves his yarn with suspense intermingled with intriguing facts. Not only did I love it but my 15 year old son, who hates to read picked it up and finished it in three days, a major accomplishment! Matt Lauer of the TODAY Show was right! BUY THE BOOK"
1,"""Meg"" is a crock","I am a scuba diver and shark fan and also like Chriton, Clancy, and Ludlum. I approached this book because it seemed like an obvious match for my tastes. Boy, was I dissapointed. The gross factual errors, the poor poor writing, the ridiculousness of the plot, it was like reading a really bad saturday morning cartoon. You can learn more about sharks or megalodons by watching re-runs of Jabberjaws, the cartoon. I am baffled that anyone at all liked this book and can't believe that anyone gave this a 10 rating! Come on! Is this the first book you-all have ever read? No one in their right mind could possibly give this book anything higher than a 5, and that would be an incredible act of generosity! ""MEG"" is a waste of trees"
1,Complete rubbish with awful writing.,Plastic writing that looks like a screenplay (and a poorly written one at that). Alten keeps up the pace but the writing is truly wooden - I've seen teenagers write better. Ludicrously laughable science and unsympathetic characters litter the book. Give this book to your worst enemy. It sucks. Bad
4,A Great Book for the Summer!,This book was very well done. The ending was cool. I really hope there is a sequel and a movie soon
2,Too preposterous to be believed,"I love a good adventure story, be it science fiction, fantasy, or even a murder mystery. So I started MEG with high expectations. The monster in this book is pretty far-fetched, but I thought ""Oh, what the heck!"" and did my usual suspension of belief. The hero of the story goes through the usual travails with great pluck in his pursuit of the monster shark. So I stuck with it though my suspension was stretching pretty far. The final part was so preposterous, though, that it became laughable and totally, but totally, unbelievable, no matter how far I stretched my unbelief. If the author intended this to be made into a movie, he can forget it. A big disappointment"
4,A great guy book!,"I picked this book up on a whim, and couldn't put it down. Not great literature, but plently of action. Going into the belly of the beast was a bit too much, however"
3,"Don't laugh, it worked for Crichton...","Yes, the characters were one dimensional. Yes, we could all see the biblical metaphor coming from page one. Yes, Alten's place research might have been as scanty as his characters' dress (shorts and bathing suits out at the Farallons? Yikes!) But never forget that when faced with a choice between a great story poorly written, and a mediocre story brilliantly written...publishers will take the great story every time. Besides, this formula works quite consistently for Crichton. The main character is the beast, and her character is just about as developed as she is"
5,"Steve Alten's first book is a must read, NY Times bestseller!!!",Meg is an hugely entertaining book with non-stop thrills. This book grabs you and doesn't let go. Its terrifying climax is superb. You just can't beat the ending of this book. Great start to a fantastic trilogy!
3,Jawdropping fun but flawed,"I loved reading this book. I've been putting it off for a few years but finally gave in and was glad I did. The action never stopped and the twists at the end were pretty fantastic. I can usually guess the endings, but Mr. Alten was one step ahead. However, I was annoyed at some of the continuity problems in the copy editing and the lack of character development and certain cliches created a flawed book. Other problems that bothered me was the simple writing style and lack of detailed descriptions in places I felt needed more of it. Regardless, I'm in for another read with the sequel, The Trench."
5,Gripping page-turner!!!,"When I first saw this book, I thought, ""A takeoff on 'Jaws'. Ho hum."" I was very wrong. This is a fast-paced, gripping book with nowhere to put it down. A believable title character, the Megaladon is a terrifying creature. This book keeps you going until the very end. Well done!"
3,Great setup .....weak ending....overall fun....,"I loved this book and enjoyed every chapter right up until the ending. I felt that the way ""our"" hero defeats this creature was a real let down. The entire book shows in fantastic descriptive ways how unstoppable the Meg is and then is defeated quite easily and most unbelievably. I have high hopes for the sequel ""The Trench"" and hope that the climax will not be as much of a let down. If anyone out there has read the sequel please write me and warn me if the ending is as ""hokey"" as the first. Or write me and encourage me that the sequel ending is more creative. Here's hoping for a much better conclusion."
4,Megged,"In his first novel Meg, Steve Alten writes a tale of a giant killer shark (Such Originality!!!!). But serously, Meg is not a disaster, well it is a disaster (story) but not one in the form of words on paper, it keeps a person reading. After a short slow start Alten places some recycled characters into short chapters in a recycled story. But the length of the chapters and reused feel does not matter. Meg is action, and Alten prevents a reader from his or her attention to wander elsewhere. Also, I must commend Alten on his research on the Megaladon's (Big dang sharks.) which winds up as very interesting reading. So to sum things up, Alten creates a world wich action and suspense lovers will embrace and enjoy not worship but enjoy none the less. A very good first work."
3,When it comes to sharks BIGGER is not always better,"Reading MEG is a double edged sword. It is easy to gulp the book down, the pacing is fast and the style so visual, but when you finish it it's like...yeah so? Besides this reads more like a film novelization than an actual book. Still it's fun in an unpretentious B-movie kind of way and, heck, I'm game for the sequel."
2,"Big on fish, short on story","While the basic idea for this story is fairly bulletproof, several things got in the way of it really being good. (1) When writing about a theme we've all seen before (big fish, big dinosaurs, big monkeys, etc.) the basic story is really has to be more sophisticated. (2) Even though it's fiction, the research needs to be better. Alten's brought a prehistoric fish into modern times. Note what it can and cannot do (be more realistic). (3) Now, let's work on that dialogue.."
4,"Quick-read, exciting non-stop action","This is a good book for what it is. A quick-read full of action and suspense. True, that somes scenes are predictable and maybe unbelievable. Tell me, could a person actually survice inside this giant sharks belly for that long? Hmmm..."
1,MEG should have stayed Extinct!,"This book was full of food!(corn and cheese)I feel sorry for someone who feels this book compares in the slightest with Peter Benchley's, JAWS. The suspense slowly peaked to a sputter, and came crashing back down again with a very dissapointing finale! If you want a good shark book I suggest you read JAWS, even if you already read it!"
5,MEG- A Brilliant novel of Deep Terror,"I first got Meg for Christmas & read It that day. A truly enjoyable story with fantastic and realistic characters. If you're interested in Sharks and all things underwater or just enjoy a good book, you'll love Meg. From beginning to end, you will not be able to put it down as Steve Alten takes you on a fantastic journey from the depths of the Ocean to the depths of fear. In my opinion this book is for everyone and I urge you to buy a copy today..."
4,but the cover is not the same,"i got this book for my mother, who enjoys the meg books.for a pre-owned book, it is in good condition considering age and all.its a little worn, but no pages are torn or anything like that.the only thing is that the cover picture is not the same as in the photo on amazon.i had to double check to make sure the title matched to make sure i got the book that i ordered.it is the same book from what i can see, but the cover has no shark or anything, just the word meg.all seems fine though because if you search for meg in the books, both the one shown and the one i got shows up."
4,And then he saw the circling dorsal fin-as tall as small sail boat,"I began this series by reading Meg:Origins , which I enjoyed quite a lot. While I still enjoyed Meg..horror the writing was certainly better in Meg... origins. This story for the obvious or what ever reason had a comfortable 70's feel , not a bad thing by any means, while origins was more timeless. I undoubtedly will read the rest of the series but probably not with the rapidity prompted by Meg:Origins."
1,I could not finish this book...,"I picked this book up based on the rave 5-star reviews. Each character, each plot point is ripped off from some earlier book or movie script. I am not surprised Disney would option this stuff, since it is aimed at the lowest common denominator of reader. It should suit the masses just fine. I even tried listening to the audio version: Stephen Lang's fine narration is wasted, and the producers even added a synthesizer rip-off of John Williams' Jaws music!"
5,Two words: Jurassic Shark!,"This book is great. I read it all in one day! It's about a sixty foot long shark that comes out of it's hiding place deep in the Challenger's Deep and starts wreaking havoc on sharks, whales, and-you guessed it-people! This book has been getting alot of negative reviews which it totally doesn't deserve. Suspense, a few laughs, action, and a great monster make this book a must read for fans of sci-fi and adventure. Ok, so some of the things in the book were far fetched, like the part when the Meg jumps completely out of the water to catch a helicopter. Do you see great whites jumping out of the water to catch flying birds. Also the part when the megaladon attacks the sub (wich was more than twice it's length) and sinks it! But all in all, it was a great book. I applaud the first time author Steve Alten who wrote this book for all the research and hard work he put into it."
1,Can I give -5 stars? Please?,I cannot possibly describe how bad this book is. It has gone beyond the realm of words..... sad. I pity those who pick this book as their first ever science fiction. Trees are wasted for the worst ever reason.
1,"Seedy devices, lousy book","This book isn't interesting, its only virtue is that it's a very quick read. The story is completely implausable, and there are a huge number of factual errors. The characters aren't very interesting, and the Meg isn't very scary. My main reason for rating it one star instead of two is the cheap marketing tactic used on the back cover--the part about the book being the summer's best read (I don't have the book in front of me at the moment) is in the same color and font as the quote just below, making it appear to be part of the quote. The reviews must have been truly horrible to merit such a tactic--""'Two words--jurassic shark'"" is not a good review, especially if the publisher couldn't find anything better written about the book in that review."
2,"Meg is a fun, albeit trashy, read.","If you're looking for a guilty pleasure, there are worse ones than Meg. Its premise is interesting, and it moves along at a fairly rapid pace. The novel's strong point is the vividly realized gigantic shark. It has plenty of weak points, including far too many lines that end in exclamations, together with some dialogue and action that can only be described as ridiculous. But if you're buying a book subtitled ""A Novel of Deep Terror,"" you should know you're not getting War and Peace. This isn't one to buy in hardcover, but it's worth a few hours of your time."
2,"Fast, exciting, entertaining, BUT.....","I had no trouble believing the premise, or even the wild ending. This is fiction after all, and as fiction MEG works for me. Certainly the writing is lacking in sophistication; the characters are shallow and flat -- especially the female characters who are completely unbelievable. In fact, the subplot about ambitious Maggie was unnecessary. It added nothing but more mayhem to the plot, and it kept the story from becoming an engrossing man versus beast fable. Too bad Alten didn't pursue the real potential here. I believe this will make a good, exciting movie and look forward to seeing it. As for those reviewers who enjoyed bashing MEG, I have two pieces of advice: first, relax and see this as the late 1990's entertainment that it is. Second, before complaining that someone can't write worth a lick, please review your review and check for spelling errors and grammatical lapses."
3,FILLED WITH ACTION! A LITTLE FAR-FETCHED,"Well, it was full of suspenseful action and I believed the first half of the book was great! But it is quite similar to Jurassic Park and the part where Jonas carves his way out of the stomach had me cracking up. But ah well, it was a fun read with some very scary scenes. Not as good as Lost World, White Shark & The Relic, but still nicely done!"
3,"Its ""Jaws"" bro.",The plot is simple and quite entertaining but lots of improvement needed on plausibility of someone getting in and out of a shark's stomach alive!
4,"GIGANTIC TERROR, ALL CRAMMED INTO ONE NOVEL!!!!!!!!!!","I just recently finished this book and it was great, Steve Alten really captures the essence of power this massive predator would portray. Jonas Taylor as the main character was a very likable character for me, he seemed to be going through a lot and you can't help but fill sorry for him. However when the mighty Megaladon rises up from the depths he and numerous others must face it's awesome power. Alten truly decribes the way people are filling in this story. The day after I finished this book I started on the sequel THE TRENCH, you can expect to see a review for it when I finish it."
3,So much potential,"Now, I loved Jaws, and I have always been intriqued by the ideas put forth in Jaws by the mere suggestion of Megladons existance. This book starts out extremely well, and ends not to shabbily. It's somewhere in the middle that it gets TOO unreal(the whole scene with the Nautilus...made my skin crawl.) If you read this one, then you need to read Extinct also...if the best parts of both books were combined, then they would be an excellent novel(much like their grandfather, Jaws) instead of two mearly 'entertaining' novels."
5,Meg,"For any of you fascinated by sharks, the reality and the myth, this book is great reading. Very compelling and linked to actual fact with some healthy fictional items thrown in. Great to see a trilogy, haven't read The Trench yet but the reviews are good and looking forward to Primal Waters"
3,In-flight Novel,"Interesting novel, but it was repetitive. Shark would surface, grab a bite, move on. Attack anything that moves or gives off sound or electrical vibrations in the water. I would think that although the shark was a little more primal and considered long extinct, it would have a little more strategy when trying to attach its prey.Otherwise, a good read, the type of book that gets you through a flight."
2,A reasonable yarn but the science is awful.,"I write this as a comment on all those who believe Alten did research for this book. I'll concede the book is a good page turner (although the plot and characters are one dimensional) but I find it difficult to believe Alten did any in depth research for this book at all. Otherwise extinct sharks trapped in the Marianas trench? Megalodons were open water feeders there would be little for them to feed on in a trench. The most productive parts of the ocean are the sunlit regions. Indeed it is well known that there is a general decrease in body size as you get deeper. Trapped by cold water? Possible but unlikely, their sheer size would give them thermal inertia. Whales changing their migratory routes in response to one predator? They didn't do that in reponse to whaling pressure. Scary book? What is really scary is that I read somewhere that the author took *years* to do the research."
2,Decent beach reading,"Pretty dumb book story-wise. I think the author did TONS of research, but came up short when it came to writing a meaningful book, but it's entertaining enough weekend fodder."
2,Mr Alten has an amazing talent...,"Mr Alten has an amazing talent....to write drivel. Rarely have I read such poorly executed fiction. ""MEG"" represents all that is misguided about contemporary fiction; where commercial objectives (MEG is so blatantly contrived for the silver screen) prevail over substance. Sadly Mr Alten, with his mechanical prose, fails dismally. MEG isn't even remotely entertaining. AVOID THIS ONE."
3,reads faster than a charging white shark,"This book reads amazingly fast, of course, it isn't all that big. But it is a fun summer read that will keep your attention. Alten researched both sharks and whales extensively, and it shows.His main character, Jonas Taylor, is well written, as are a few other characters, but some of the human interaction is slow and forced, such as the romantic development between Taylor and Terry Tanaka. The complete carnage toward the end of the book is a bit much, and while I don't want to ruin the ending, Taylor's final confrontation with Meg does stretch believability.However, the action moves very quickly and hardly ever misses a beat, and you will want to get to the end to see how it all turns out. Alten mixes known science with great imagination to provide a great story which reminds us that what we don't know far exceeds what we do. And what we dont' know can hurt us."
1,So bad I couldn't finish it,"I honestly tried to stick it out. I really hate to stop reading a book, but it was too painful to go on. I'm a big fan of horror and suspense and picked this book up on a lark.The characters were flat. The Smurfs have more textured personality than the characters in this book.That aside, there was no real suspense. Every bit of bad luck, horror was always preceded by so much obvious set up, one could easily guess the outcome of the situation. It actually made me angry.If you want a truly mindless read, this may be a book for you. It's simplistic, and quick to read, but an absolute insult to your intellect."
1,"Meg, mega bummer","Meg may be the worst book I have ever read, it's between it and Extinct, which is basically the same plot line. There is not a character in this book I can find believable. The main character is supposedly a washed out deep sea scientist with every conceivable problem in the world in an overdone effort to make us feel sorry for him. Right down to his wife sleeping with his best friend! The menace is a 60 foot long shark that the author has tried to sell as plausible... Jurassic Park had more believable biology. I won't start to bore you with the facts but suffice it to say that it is ridiculous. Then the end? I won't even try and ruin it for you but it had me laughing with the thought! If you want a more realistic, scary fish story get ""One Fish Two Fish, Red Fish Blue Fish"" by Dr. Zeus."
1,AMAZON.COM = CENSORSHIP,"Meg was a lousy paperback. I felt that the characters were poorly developed, and what potentially could have been an excellent read degraded into a very predictable plot which was further degraded by a series of very unrealistic events (i.e. the mere sight of the giant shark causes a bunch of choppers to collide). I would avoid this one and instead dust off my old Peter Benchley novels."
4,"This book ,swallow you whole.Tenderize ya.Down ya go.","This book has something.If they made a movie of it, it could be edited differently.Just like Jaws was.I see a future in it.They can change the end a little differently,making it more realistic.People like mystery.Not subs going into a shark.I can see maybe biting into the sub.Also get someone who can conduct great music for it.NOT SOME UNKNOWN.Music helps in a film alot,and acting"
2,"Disappointing - interesting premise, bad delivery","Disappointing. ""Jurassic Shark"" said the Los Angeles Times, succinctly summing up the plot, the discovery of a prehistoric giant shark in the depths of the Marianas Trench that finds its way to shallower waters to wreak havoc. Two-dimensional characters, most of them unlikable, trite and boring. Showing occasional flashes of promise that kept petering out, it nevertheless captured my attention long enough for me to want to find out what happened in the end. The author is obviously not a scuba diver himself, constantly referring to tanks of ""oxygen"" and ""air"" in the same paragraph, which is really annoying. Pity, because the premise is fascinating but the author fails to deliver."
3,good,this one was pretty good --unfortunately I read Hell's Aquarium first so I already knew a lot about this story
5,MEG rules! It is such a good reading,"Jonas Taylor, a paleontologist, finds himself face-to-face with a carcharodon megalodon, a prehistoric shark and possibly the biggest predator ever to live on our planet, and escapes alive. No one believes him until the horror starts to appear at the ocean's surface. Meg is extremely angry, hungry and pregnant and goes on a rampage. Taylor and other scientists try to capture the beast, but find out they are dealing with Earth's most powerful and vicious killing machine. Non-stop action, full of great reading, this book makes Jaws look very small. A classic."
2,"OK, but the sequel sounds better . . .","You don't really expect much from a book like this, which is good considering all you get. Another big hairy monster is prowling the seas, eating people and wrecking ships. This time it's a previously supposed-extinct prehistoric shark, and Only One Man Knew It Was Still . . . OUT THERE! Yawn. Two dimensional characters, a silly plot, and zero tension/excitement/suspense/fear. Perhaps Mr. Alten should name his second novel ""Watching Paint Dry""? It would be more exciting than his first.Seriously, though, his sequel, ""The Trench"", does sound like it'll be quite fun. From what I gather he's finally dropping everything else and going down the same road as ""Godzilla"". Good for him.I'll be looking out for ""The Trench"". As for ""Meg""; I wouldn't even bother."
2,Good beginning ... then just silly.,"Very good beginning. Well written prose, good scientific detail, characters with potential. then it started to get shaky near the middle. the characters did not develop reasonably and became simple cardboard cutouts. then the action at in the final chapters was so implausible I wondered if the author was making some kind of joke. In the end I was left feeling like someone had just told me a hairy dog story."
3,Good book but basic technical errors,This book was basically very good but could have been great if the author would have had a better knowlege of submersibles and diving. He made some major technical errors which killed the realism. Since this book is very similar to Peter Benchley in style it should emulate him in accuracy as well. The basic premise of the main charactor having been involved in a sub accident which killed two crew members due to not decompressing is a major error. Sub crews do not get pressurized on descent so they do not decompress on accent. Also divers do not breath oxygen they breath compressed air. It seems strange that these errors could be made at this point in time considsering how exposed the general public has been exposed to undersea exploration. These errors just seemed to undercut the underlying story line.
3,"Its good, but not creative","The while the story is entertaining and suspensful, there is nothing that this book offers after the shark surfaces that has not been seen in a JAWS movie or any other work of Peter Benchly (Such as WHITE SHARK or THE BEAST). For example there is even a cage incident, but I guess you can't have a shark story without one. Steve Alten does do a decent job making the reader believe that such a shark could still be in existence."
3,Reads like a quickie novelization of a movie.,"MEG begins with what might be the most awkward prologue I've ever read. The writing utterly fails to convey the excitement and danger of what in concept should have been a thrilling scene. After these early pages, however, the writing quickly improves and ultimately the book proves to be an engrossing, if somewhat cliche, thriller. One interesting point: This reads almost like a treatment for a movie. It's as if the author first wrote a screenplay then turned it into a novel. In the entire novel, there are literally about two sentences devoted to the internal thoughts of the characters - everything else is performed or spoken out loud! Still, MEG is an entertaining book and would make a good movie."
3,A real page turner. Very exciting.,"Wow, I was wanting to read this for awhile and finally did last week. I was not disappointed, it was a real page turner and very exciting. My only complaint is that some of the action seemed fuzzy and I had to re-read a paragraph or two to figure out what happened. If you like Jurassic Park then you should love Meg."
5,Move over Jaws!,Great monster book! Steve Alten is a great writer. I can't wait to start on the next book in the series. If you liked Jaws you will love this book!
2,Cartoon with bad editing,"I found the story in this book enjoyable but every time I came across another editing issue, it pulled me right out of the suspension of disbelief. And the editing issues are frequent. I mean, seriously, how hard is it to edit a book and make sure ""the"" is not spelled ""tge""? Ridiculously amateur in the writing and editing.Fun story, not particularly original. I got it free and read it on my kindle. Glad it was free. Won't be reading the next two in the series.Steve Alten: learn how to write man. And hire an editor. Please."
3,Perfect summer reading...,"No, it's not Shakespeare. No, it won't make you re-think your deep-seated convictions about human nature. No, it won't even tell you that much about sharks.But man, this was fun to read! (As was the sequel, which I found slightly more involved.) Written almost as a script, Alten foregoes endless paragraphs of exposition by substituting minimalist narration and well-staged action sequences. As a result, you can almost see this on the big screen as you're reading it. It's not a long read, but it is a fun one!"
3,Not bad for a 1st book,"... I felt the shark was relying on emotion more than instinct in certain areas of the book. Of course, with the main character named ""Jonas"", it was easy to predict his ""close"" encounter with Meg."
3,It's not the worst book I've read..................,"MEG is a fast-paced entertaning book, and that's all that should be expected of it, if you're looking for great literature just keep on going, but if you want a little excitement and nothing too heavy, MEG isn't too bad.. although a little character development wouldn't have hurt."
3,A QUICK READ BUT NOT A CLASSIC !,"I found ""MEG"" to be exciting and entertaining. I was not expecting to read a book like ""JAWS"". I did not enjoy the contrived romance between Jonas and Terry. There was no need for the characters to become ""involved"" in a romantic relationship. Jonas inside MEG? -- TOO FAR FETCHED!! I gave it to my father, who from the beginning pointed out all the inconsistencies, but we both agreed that it was an interesting idea. It made me think about swimming in the ocean... I don't believe the author was trying to write the next ""GREAT NOVEL"" and his purpose seems to be to simply engross his reader with action and adventure. I must at least credit the author with capturing my attention and writing about an idea that's scary to think about."
4,Better than Jurrasic Park and Jaws but some flaws!,"This book was good I wouldn't have bought it if it was not for the fact the author is from my area.(so i was told)I don't usually read books like this but i was supprised at how well it was written. Even though there are flaws such as other reviewers ponted out (ex. Oxygen in stead of air in the tanks, and misspelling of names that don't exist in japanese) it was well reasearched and written. For those of you who say it should not have been published dont say that, lets see you do better."
4,"An excellent first novel, based on an original idea","I picked up Steve Alten's book ""Meg"" at 4.25pm, and couldn't put it down until I'd finished it shortly after midnight. The central idea, that a 60-foot-plus, biologically superior shark could be cruising the oceans gripped me from the first couple of pages. It wasn't a perfect book - I thought a couple of elements could have been handled slightly better, but it was an excellent first novel, and with the possibility of a sequel, it's hopefully a sign of good things to come."
3,to all the detractors .. loosen your JAWS and relax,OK its not the best thing on the rack .. but it was quick fun and entertaining ... a great afternoon on the beach type read ( which is what I did )I thought the premise of a 60 foot shark was farfetched ... that was until I saw an actual pictureof 8 scientist sitting inside the skeletal mouth ofone of these things ...I subsequently did some research via internet searches and found out that they grew upwards of 100 feet ..... glad they're still not around ...So as for the book ... it was light reading and enjoyable .... take it for what its worthSteve Ferguson 11/11/97
2,"Check it out from the library for a quick, fun read.","MEG was a bit of a disappointment after all the ""hoop-la"" in the promotion of the book. But, looking back, it was a actually a break from any heavy reading. You just kept in mind that this was fiction, not fact. Best bet is to get it from the library, though, this is not a book to keep in your collection of classics and ""I will read agains."""
4,"If you like Jaws movies, you'll love this...","Once the story gets going, this book is literally impossible to put down. The ending had a couple of nice twists to it, also. And the last 140 pages or so... Awesome!The character's were a little shallow, but the action made up for that!"
1,book is bad egg...,"They say this book be for bad reeders like me, but i don't like it. this book is not exceting or interesting. Steve Alten III is a very sexy man, but he cant write."
2,Alten will get better.,"Steve Alten's first book is everything you would expect. The total premise of this book is good for a laugh, and I only purchased it off the bargin table.The idea of a prehistoric 70 foot white shark is intersting. It is a very quick read with likeable characters like Jonas Taylor. The action is a bit choppy like the ocean it is set in, but once the reader gets going it does show some flow. This book is not for those who have nightmare about the deep, or those who don't like a lot of blood.I enjoyed the book until the ending which was a cross between Fairy Tale and Jurassic Park, But then we are dealing with a prehistoric shark so let your imagination take over when reading the last 30 pages.Alten's no Benchley but give him some time and see what ""The Trench has to offer."
1,MEG's not a GEM,"Having read a lot about Mr. Alten and his books, especially MEG, I decided to try it out. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. While anticipating something similar to ""Jaws"", I had no idea that it would be deja vu all over again. The overall theme of the book is simply worn out. But that's not the worst. The 8th grade writing style, and choppy structure is why this book fails. Character development is nonexistent; and relationships somehow spontaniously combust, or with Jonas and Terry quite unbelievably ignite. Poetic Justice becomes passe, with the only true enjoyable scene being Maggie's demise."
2,"Good book, bad point","It's unfortunate that the author felt it necessary to make snide remarks on belief systems within a decent story line. The story was well written and actually entertaining. BUT, by repeatedly including lines such as ""miracle of evolution"", the author caused a distraction from the story line by making fun of evolutionary beliefs. Yes, their are ""miracles"" necessary for evolution to be true, but leave that for scientists to deal with, not fiction novels."
4,Lots of fun,"A great, quick, summer read. The characters could use a little more fleshing out, but who cares - there's a big, mean shark in the water! REad it, it's fun."
1,The reason the illiteracy rate is so high.,"MEG - a novel of deep terror.A novel of unrelenting tedium.A novel devoid of originality.A novel astonishing in its lack of depth.A novel remarkable for its inability to create characters to root for.A novel undeserving of praise of any kind.A novel written because the idea of a really big shark is 'cool'.A novel that makes one weep for the trees that dies to create it.A novel that makes one want to plunge a finger through their eyesocket into their brain, and swirl it around.A novel that, if the choice were given, will cause a person to choose the agony of electrocution rather than read it again.A novel that is a complete, utter, unending waste of time."
3,Meg,"Okay, so heres the deal for me on this one...I'm a huge horror/sci-fi reader and I read alot so originally I was kind of excited aboutreading a novel about a prehistoric shark entering our era of existence.I had read some of the reveiws expressing what a talented author Mr. Alten is and howaction packed this particular novel is so I decided to give it a shot.But I pretty quickly found out that although the Meg. scenes are entertaining, therest of the characters are painfully predictable.I figured out way in advance most of the things that happened and for me thats a biglet down.Not only this but also they are almost entirely unbelieveable, like for one small example,the dialogue is one thing that kept stabbing me like a thorn in the side.These are like hardcore military men and there's rarely any cursing throughout the novel,I know a few military men and women and they are rather profane individuals.So thats just my opinion on things."
1,The worst book ever.,"This book is easily the worst book I have ever read. I have read and watched enough science fiction that I am able to used my imagination or suspend my disbelief in order to enjoy a book or movie, but this book is simply ridiculous. I am no marine biologist or ocenographer, but I simply could not believe 90% of the ""science"" in this book. The poor science coupled with cookie-cutter characters and an oh-so-predictable plot(oh, gee, the ex-wife got eaten, what a surprise!) make for one lousy read. You can defintely tell that this is written as as a screenplay with all of the expostional dialagoue. It reminded me of the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation when characters needed to explain their roles to fellow crew members for the audience's sake. Do not buy this book. Do not believe that it is a great summer read. There are too many other page turners out there to waste your time with this garbage."
1,Worst book I've read this year,"A moronic plot, thin characters and page after page of bad writing. My recommendation would be to skip this one and read something else. ANYTHING else."
2,And I Thought 'Jaws' was bad,"There has never been a succesful giant shark novel written, and the pattern doesn't break now. The characters were poorly sketched and had few personality traits, and before I had read the first 100 pages I found myself hoping that they would all be devoured by the overgrown Jaws. Descriptions were boring, and the end is hopelessly ridiculous in which the lead character, a retired deep-sea diver, saves the life of his young love by entering the shark's stomach and sawing her heart off with a fossolized Megalodon tooth. The only reason this literary failure got two stars from me is because the plot seemed exciting (if not already over-done), but bland characters and awful descriptions failed the book."
1,Amateurish,"I struggled to finish this book. I realize it's popular fiction, not meant to be taken too seriously, but COME ON. So many of the plot devices were unbelievable, characters were cardboard, dialogue was idiotic, the writing was just crappy. The author for some reason feels the need to use exclamation marks (!) during the narrative throughout the book. As if he couldn't generate enough excitement, so he'll say 'The shark jumped out of the water!' Where was the editor! This book should not have been published!"
5,Bought as a gift.,Anything that will bring us closer to understanding the great love of God is a plus. This little book meets the criteria.
5,ABSOLUTELY GREAT BOOK,"THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE NOVELS THAT WAS VERY HARD TO PUT DOWN ONCE YOU BEGAN TO READ. THE CHARACTERS WERE EVERY DAY PEOPLE, SOME OF WHICH HAD SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS. I LOVED THIS BOOK AND LOOK FORWARD TO READING ANY FUTURE BOOKS BY MS. GELLER."
3,Not That Exciting,"It's not that the book is terrible, it just loses energy when the focus turns from the crimes to the personal lives of Rebecca, Jack, and Tom. The soap opera aspects of their relationships detract from the suspense plot that only picks up when they all go into court near the end.While the author is described as an attorney who later worked with sex offenders, her trial scenes lack a certain feeling of versimilitude. The ending relies too heavily on the killer losing control. It was really lucky for the police that they never had to take their last case to court because all of their evidence would have probably been thrown out for lack of probable cause in obtaining the warrant... published."
3,bratz? Pirates?....,"This doll is beatiful with her lovely doesn`t tangle wavy hair that`s soft i might add. But there problems with the advertisiments and the ""image"" it gives young girls. I mean come on! Look at how short there skirts are and shorts are! And that shirt and sweater that she wears i mean i think bratz dolls never really get covered up and young girls who sees these dolls might want to dress up just like them now or when they grow up! Who in the right mind made these pirate idea for bratz what`s the benefit for girls to dress up like sluts when they grow up? The more and more i see bratz dolls the more i don`t want them . Once i liked bratz before they became what they are now i hope you know what i`m trying to say. Stick with myscene or barbie at least they have some diginity for girls futures."
4,Naughty Navy !,"Here is a typical little English comedy, of those Sellers did before he was an established international star! The film is enjoyable, has a good hearted humour and was loved by the audience (that's why there was a sequel made, but unfortunately without Sellers). And what a brilliant idea-some navy people in an almost forgotten ship, have turned their ship into a very profitable shop! When some official finally visits them, they have to ""disguise"" their business and keep it going! One of the funniest versions of corruption! sellers' is great, teamed with other well-known English character actors such as Wilfrid Hyde White and David Tomlinson. Recommended!"
3,"Bratz karaokee machine, could be better","Bought this for Christmas. It's not too bad, but the microphone tends to cut out often. Unless its right up against your mouth, you cant really hear them sing through it. Other than that, its pretty easy to use and the kids have fun."
5,A Dark Tale,This book is a must read about a conspiracy to murder President Lincoln. It reads quickly and keeps the reader captivated. I highly recommend.
4,MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY MADE EASY!,"I just started taking a medical terminology class last month and I was sure that learning all of these new complicated words would be extremely difficult but the Medical Terminology (A Programmed Systems Approach) 8th Edition is so easy to follow and actually fun to do. I've found myself fascinated with the idea that one word can have so many different meanings behind it. The way the book is set-up it has sort of an elementary school appeal to it because you work in it frame by frame and instead of skipping from one term to the next the book is constantly re-introducing you to terms that you've learned in previous units and intermingling them with the new ones.The only disappointment in this book was that the paperback version did not include the terminology tapes that accompany the hardcover version, but other that that this book is a good investment if you plan to go into the medical field or if you just want to learn for your own personal knowledge."
5,Great,"I was a bit skeptical because the price was so great, but the book came in a timely manner, the CD was included and works great. I would highly recommend anyone get the CD with this book because you learn more than what's in the book. The minimal writing in the book was accurate.I would recommend this seller."
5,fast shipping!,The class had started so we needed the book fast! We received it in just a few days and it was in great condition. Thanks!
1,Too Small,"I bought my wife a Notre Dame pillowcase and when hers arrived it actually looked good and was big so I decided to get a matching Georgia one, well when it arrived we put them on our pillows and the Georgia one was a lot smaller even though it is the same damn pillowcase."
2,not good,this text is too superficial on all topics and i wouldn't recommend it. go with the consumer report guide on dental health.
1,Samsung speakers for the flat monitor,"The product description sounds like an engineering success, but the speakers sound like a bad AM radio. Very little bass, tinny sound."
3,Liebling for Soprano,"It is a very useful book. The exercises are a great addition to the usual vocalises I use with students. The criticisms I have are of the texts in the book, which were written before pedagogy took a turn to the scientific and diction professionals started using IPA. I tell my students to ignore the text part of the book or to take it with a grain of salt."
3,Kind of small,I thought the puppet was kind of small. I have small hands and it was kind of snug on my hands. I think that a child would have an easier time manipulating the puppet. It is very cute though.
5,Adorable!,"I love Folkmanis puppets, and use quite a few of them in story time at our local public library. This little porcupine is my newest addition and has quickly become a favorite! He is very easy to manipulate, with plenty of room for my hand. It's easy to take on and off, which is key when you are making those transitions in story time. His hair is in two different colors, making him look like he has spikes. He is built so he can curl up pretty easily, with his paws covering his eyes, which only makes him that much cuter! Kids are surprised when they find out how soft he is - they love to come up and investigate his ""quills"". A wonderful story time addition or an excellent purchase for any child's personal collection. Folkmanis puppets are high quality animals that are built to last, and this porcupine is sure to withstand lots of little hugs and cuddles."
5,Great Porcupine - Love It!,"A few friends and I have an inside joke concerning porcupines. I was trying to find a stuffed one for a gag gift for Christmas, but plush porcupines aren't the easiest things to find. Most of the ones I did find were very ugly and looked more like a hedgehog. When I found this porcupine, though, he looked so much more realistic and I went ahead and bought him.He was a huge hit and is absolutely adorable! My friends love him to death and he was a total success. He's very realistic looking and extremely cute. If for whatever reason you need a stuffed porcupine, I'd certainly recommend this one. :)"
4,Power Pop Rockin' with Myracle Brah,"Buy this album now!! The latest offering from Myracle Brah delivers twelve super-delicious tracks, including several POWER-pop rockers such as the lead track, ""I'd Rather Be,"" and the Shazam-like rave up ""Going Crazy."" All the tracks feature Andy Bopp's amazingly pure vocals, memorable melodies, and powerful guitars.This album shows a more mature song-writing style and blues-influenced composition than previous MB efforts, in my opinion. The guitar work and boogie groove on ""Hey Now,"" for example, harken back to the best rock-pop of yesteryear, recalling (but not reproducing) songs by Rod Stewart, Cheap Trick, and others.The album also includes several dreamy ballads to offer a moment of relaxation between the more driven numbers. Fans of The Shazam, Sloan, Todd Rundgren, and Mott The Hoople should enjoy this album. Buy it today!"
4,Works,"Although the drive doesn't look anything like the picture shown on the item page, and I mean, it doesn't even have a cap, it works well and serves it's purpose."
4,brings back fond jayhawks memories,"this is the first time i have heard anything from the ex lead singers of one of the best ""alt-country"" bands ever. when i put it in my cd player the music and his voice brought back memerios of the hollywood town hall. this album is plain and simple with nice melodies and great lyrics."
2,Not up to par,"I have great respect for the talents of Mark Olson, his wife Victoria Williams and the other players who make up the Original Harmony Ridge Creek Dippers. In fact, their first two albums (released on their own label), S/T and Pacific Coast Rambler are among my faves. One would think that this Hightone release would mark a step up, but instead, My Own Jo Ellen seems a bit flat to me. The melodies aren't as sweet, the lyrics aren't as, well...lyrical, and the whole effort sounds a little tired. Maybe my expectations were too high."
3,"Dualist heresies, anyone?","Another so-so book about the medieval developments of Eastern European dualist heresies. The first part of the book, which I enjoyed the most, traced the origins of Christian dualism to Zoroastrianism and Manicheism. Then the book went into a detailed description of Eastern European Bogomils and briefly touched upon Catharism and Albigensians. After reading the book I am still not sure about the content of the doctrines of these dualist heresies, though in the last five or six pages the author discusses the Bogomil Christology and biblical hermeneutics. I cannot believe how ridiculous these teachings were. I loved the quote from the Yashna (45:2): ""Neither our thoughts nor teachings nor intentions, neither our preferences, nor words, neither our actions nor conceptions nor our souls are in accord."""
5,works well,These came with no instructions but they work SO well in our home. It was easy to figure out and install.
5,Cabinet Repair,"We installed our kitchen cabinets 12 years ago and now the door hinges are no longer closing properly so I am slowly replacing. I started with locally purchased hinges from a cabinet supply store and paid about 3 times as much for this same item. When I finish installing the ones that I purchased, I'm sure that I will purchase some more hinges from this source because most likely the old hinges will continue to fail. I also purchased Blum 110 Degrees Knock In Self Closing Compact 33 Hinges as part of the set."
5,Unsettled settles many questions,"It has been a long time since I have read a book which does such a good job covering such a large topic. Many of the questions I had as to how Jewish history and outlook ""fit together"" were answered. I would recommend this book highly for anyone trying to obtain a clear and objective history of the Jewish people and what makes them ""tick."""
2,It ain't anthropology!,"One looks here in vain for anything about the anthropology of the Jews, or indeed for anything not found in thousands of books already. What we get instead is a prosaic account of how the Jews have been mistreated for centuries (they have!) and how much they deserved better (they did!). This doesn't really contribute much in any case.If one read fewer publishers' blurbs, one would buy fewer bad books."
2,Textbook thinking,"Topic-wise this book is fascinating. Unfortunately it reads like a very monotonous textbook.Example: ""Practicalist reject a recurrent philosophical fantasy of finding a langage free from the limits of any language in which to speak of the limits of all language. Limit and perspective are intrinsic to language and to thought, not a deficiency of them. In particular, practicalists have been suspicious of attributing to science a priviledged relation to reality and making scientific knowledge the paradigm of intellectual accountability against which all other ways of knowing are tested.(pg. 15)""Not for light reading."
2,While the topic could be interesting...,"This book is clearly written on a extreme biased point of view. While I understand most writings tend to be biased, good writers are able to engage the reader who may even disagree with the author's point of view; this fails."
1,Can't adjust position of light,"The sphere that holds the bulb is attached to the base by a fixed length, fairly stiff, electrical cord. Because of this, there is NO way to position the light so it illuminates what you want it to. This makes it useless as a spot light or as a light that you want to position. I returned it."
4,Skip Bo Deluxe,"The only thing I was disappointed about in the Deluxe Skip Bo game was the fact that no words are printed on the playing board. I noticed on the box that it is in English as well as French -- I would have preferred to have the boxes on the board designated as to what they are for -- especially for someone just learning the game, such as my husband."
4,Great but...,"This box set is great, but some of the content on these CD's is different from what was originally released on vinyl. Not bad but in my opinion, the original stuff was better. Nonetheless, whether one is a veteran or new to his comedy, this anthology of Richard Pryor's work is well worth owning and a joy to listen to again and again."
5,Richard is King!,"By far, THE most talented comic I have ever heard. This had me rolling, especially the bits collected from That Nigger's Crazy...my all time favorite Richard Pryor tape! Wino Dealing with Dracula is absolutely THE funniest thing I have ever heard! Buy this, believe me, you will not be disappointed!"
5,THE GREATEST,The Comedians of all Comedians.THis Man SIngle Handly forever changed the face of Comedy as we know it.i have all of His Recordings&then some.He was a Voice that caught my Ear very early on.He Broke The Rules Of The Game with His Honesty.Very Direct Vibe that made Him Take On any Subject Matter.The Brother is Deep&On Point.He is a True Artist.You Can Feel His Pain&Isolation.there is no one Like Him.He is a True Ground-Breaker&Innovator.these Discs will Remind you of the Depth Of This Genius.MUDBONE Rules.Madd Props To Paul Mooney as well.Richard Pryor is in a Class all unto Himself.
3,Good as Gold? Close!,A trip to the bookstore and Goldie was coming home with us! Acolorful and entertaining look at the age-old comparison betweenolder/younger siblings. Expressed in an age appropriate voice for veryyoung book fans. The illustrations are a real treat--bright and humorous!
3,Good as Gold? Close!,A trip to the bookstore and Goldie came home with us! An entertaining look at the age-old comparison between older/younger siblings. The illustrations are a treat!
5,Excellent,"Most of the time, to have a good knowledge about something doesn't mean you can teach it properly. Because to teach something requires a lot of different abilities. To play basketball very good does not make you a good coach.That's why most of the tecnichal books about computers, even for the beginner ones, are so confusing. Because most of the writers are professional programmers but not teachers. They don't have the ability to make communication with readers (students), and understand their needs. They don't have the ability to teach something they know. They don't have the knowledge of the educational psychology.But Dubois is different. He is a writer, instructor, teacher, professional programmer. He knows every question you possibly will ask, and have answers and examples for everyone of them.This is the best technical book I have ever read, even for me (I am not a native English speaker).Highly recommended for MySQL beginners"
3,it is basically the mysql free reference,I found all the information are there in MySQL reference which is free if you download from mysql web site.It is OK to have but the instruction was wrong if you install the windows version of MySQL server.
4,Great as a reference / advanced text,"I was already developing mysql & php sites and apps when i purchased this book, so it was a good buy as a reference text, but if you intent to learn Mysql, there are better books than this one.It is deep, slow to read, with rather small text size. For the beginner, i think it's not a good starter. But on the other hand it has almost everything you would want to know about Mysql, with lots of examples and quite well explained.I learned Mysql and PHP from Sam's ""Php and Mysql web development"", and i couldn't recommend that one enough. It's a GREAT text for the beginner. I found myself writing Php/Mysql web sites in less than 3 months, starting from nothing."
3,Good for other games,"I did not buy this miniatures to play Dreamblade but to play D&D 3.75 (Pathfinder). There are some fun miniatures that can but used in D&D game. It is easy to rebase them and some monster are just too similar to D&D monsters in the most of the monsters manuals (Ffrom I to V). If it does not exist, well, just create a very fun monster."
5,Perfect,"I ordered this for my daughter's dorm room. It is perfect! Great size, great shape and exactly what she wanted."
5,Great pillow,"I bought one of these years ago elsewhere for my husband, and his brother has been trying to steal it ever since. We were so happy to find this here, so it became his birthday present. He was thrilled. Great for sitting up watching tv or reading!"
5,Old school club music,Great buy if your looking for this old classic club music . It great memmories. The decription was everything that ewas told
1,Deeply Disappointing,"It's hard to write clearly about ideas, so it's no surprise that Rawls fails. His book is worse than dense, it's nearly impenetrable, and does not do justice (ahem) to his subject. Far better books exist, and I recommend any of them before this one. Only buy it if it's required for a class -- otherwise you'll feel that you wasted your money."
1,Poetic Review of an Irrelevant View of Justice,"John Rawls would feign professThat over power his does not obsess,And that his first principle,(if he is to have principles at all)Is most exstensive equal liberty for all.But I doubt this is really true.For what he wants for me and youIs to be veiled, simple botsAnd see ourselves as just have-nots.For in that placid state of ""dumb""Ambition(Pink Floyd, forgive me)Would grow comfortably numb.We all would cheerfully chooseThe beating of the socialist drum.The welfare state would grow immenseAnd cradle us in its kind hands.And if you missed this poet's brew,I will explain in prose for you:Rawls imagines that all of us have to imagine ourselves being both ignorant and have nots. And having imagined ourselves as such we would adopt a socialist public policy. His philosophizing is absurd and irrelevant. ""A Theory of Justice"" is one of the most overrated books of the twentieth century."
1,Collectivism + Material Equality = Oppressive Morality,"Even if Rawls' theory of determinism was true, it doesn't give others the right to deprive me of the fruits of my labor.If one man likes to work from dawn to dusk, and I like to lay on the beach drinking rum and coke, economic inequality will occur. It would be precisely as unjust to compel me to work as it would be to compel the worker to surrender the fruits of his labor to me.Liberals complain about conservatives legislating morality (a valid criticism), and then they turn around and legislate the most oppressive morality in the world today."
3,Not that bad,"My fellow reviewer overstated Rawls's failings. Rawls must be given credit (perhaps more than I give him-- four stars for effort) for producing something almost unique in political philosophy: a robust, complete theory that he derives from as few premises as possible. Nozick argues against Rawls, but he doesn't disprove him.That said, the premises he does assume are questionable. The veil is a neat trick, but not convincing. Rawls never pretends that anything like it historically takes place, but even as an heuristic model it's hard to imagine anyone making important decisions with NO information. He assumes that people are risk-averse (try as he might to sweep that under the rug). Most damning of all though is his own determinism: if nobody deserves anything anyway, what's wrong with inequality?"
2,The Original Edition isn't for first timers; get the Revised Edition,"Rawls significantly revised his book after its initial publication, clarifying points and answering criticisms, and he considers the Revised Edition to be the definitive version. But the Original Edition is what comes up in Amazon searches, with no indication that there even is a revised edition, so use the ISBN to do your search to find it:0-674-00078-1or9780674000780In the introduction, the publishers of the reprinted Original Edition said they wanted it to remain in print mainly for Rawls scholars, to trace his thought.Rawls says in his introduction to the 1999 publication of the Revised Edition, ""This revised text includes what I believe are significant improvements...(and is) superior to the original."""
2,"COPYCATS, RECIPES COPIED EXACTLY ,NO NEW RECIPES","This book was a big dissapointment for me! I love cordon bleu books, have most of the ones they have published, and use them very frequently. When this book came out, I immediately bought it, only to FIND OUT THEY COPIED THE EXACT SAME RECIPES FROM THE BOOKS IN THE HOME COLLECTION SERIES (the series broken up into subjects like chicken, seafood, italian, etc. with a total of 24 volumes). The book even has the same pictures!So, if you are just buying books from cordon bleu, buy this book, it has wonderful recipes. But if you already own the books in the series they published in 1998 or 1999, then do not waste your time or your money.Maybe cordon bleu and whoever is responsible for their publishings should be a bit more serious and quit recycling photos and recipes. If they are planning to publish a book, they should do much more than just copy, paste and change the font and the background!"
4,Pretty useful.,"I picked this book up at a used book shop some years ago and it now is probably my favorite cookbook in my collection. I just even like flipping through it. It has a lot of great recipes. Seafood Paella... yummm. Although it appears that you do need to modify some recipes. The baguette recipe not only stripped gears on a KitchenAid Artisan mixer due to being far too dense, but it also came out like a bland brick. So I will be looking at other cookbooks for bread recipes.Overall I am very pleased. I would spend $20 on it, but highly doubt that it is worth the $80 as Amazon is listing right now for a new one."
1,FAKE REVIEWS - at least the first 6 or so,"The first several reviews were written within a couple days apart - certainly raises a suspicion. I don't have time to figure out if the rest of the glowing reviews are fake, too."
3,A lot of fluff,"Much of this book is fluff. He spends a lot of ink on things a reasonable person would never say or do at an interview. Also, many of his ""serious"" question seem ill advised."
5,A must-have resource for the job seeker!!!!,Excellent resource for the job seeker!!! Offers great tips and balance tilting questions to ask your recruiter or hiring manager. I much appreciate the focus on the actual questions CANDIDATES should ask vs. what we should say to a hiring manager in response to THEIR questions. Easy to read as well.
4,Absolutely Worth Reading,The book was full of practical and extremely useful examples. Easy to pick up and put down and digest in short bursts. Easy to focus on specific areas of concern -- not a textbook. It generated ideas and provided insight about how the interviewer thinks... well worth the investment.
5,A Seasoned Recruiter,"I read the book from cover to cover, in one sitting and found it profoundly comprehensive and entertaining. I didn't want to put it down. As I read, I kept saying, ""Yes, uh-huh, that's true, that's really good."" As a recruiter, I know my candidates would be more successful if they took greater responsibility for a successful interview through asking appropriate questions. The question is an invaluable tool to communicate something to me that hasn't been covered during the interview; when done well, it's one more chance to help me see the fit of the candidate to the position.John Kador's interviewing insights and list of questions enable the job seeker to think more strategically, promote their strengths, and communicate more professionally during the different stages of the interview process.I'd definitely recommend this book to even the most experienced interviewers! (and even a few recruiters!)"
4,a fun fast game,"I have just purchased this game and played a few times. The included rules are worthless. Just go to their website and download the strategy guide and play a few times.The game is lots of fun and requires dexterity and strategy. the concept is very clever and engaging.Not something I would play all the time, but a good filler."
1,Garbage,"This piece of equipment is a huge waste of money. As soon as I tried to use it the handle falls off and it won't go back on. I had to use it without the handle, all of the attachments began to bend and became useless! Buy some other dent puller, because this one is trash."
3,not as good as it is,"- The handle is pulled off when I try to pull it. The hooker is not hard enough. It is bended when I used it to pull. Overall, not recommended!!"
1,Waste of money,"When used for the first time,the threads in the handle stripped off rendering the puller useless.Save your money and buy a better quality puller,this one is worthless and could be dangerous in the wrong hands."
3,"needs reengineering, then it works","After reading the comments checked it out and sure enough the handle is poorly designed. It only has 1/2 inch of threads on the plastic shaft and was very sure with any hard use the handle would break off. As a result I used some epoxy, JB weld, and completely coated the steel shaft and handle with it and then screwed it back together, I let is set for 24 hours, and then used it to pull a quarter panel and part of a door with no problem at all. The sheet metal screw was of poor quality but easily replaced, fairly sure the flange attachment is weak, but for the money this puller works, it's not a 5 pound puller but for most dents it will work if you correct the problem with the handle."
5,VERY Interesting,"***How do flies walk on the ceiling?***Why does the wind blow?***If you sold your entire body, how much would you get for it?I think I'd get a lot more than the books says on this last question!!!?? It's really a fun reading book of interesting facts. Wish the Author would come out with another one!! Good stocking stuffer or for the book rack in the ""Reading room with the porcelain seat""...AKA...the bathroom!! :o)"
2,In Conversation........,"Unfortunately this is NOT the best interview of Tori. It is from ""little Earthquakes"" - there is some interruption within the interview - kind of a back yard job. But nether the less if you are a die hard Tori Fan, I guess it is worth adding to the collection. But don't expect to be enthralled with this one!"
5,"Love it or leave it, I love it!","As a child I hated black licorice with the best of them but now as an adult, I absolutely adore it.This is some of the best I've ever had. The size is nice (not just one bite but also not a whole foot of licorice).Definitely will get it for my personal treat.This is the one treat I can have that the kids and my wife won't eat."
2,about as good as the original xbox version,"Brought Moto Gp 2006 on the strength of the review over on Ign. I totally agree with what Sierra Whisky has written in his review of Moto Gp.Moto GP on the 360 is the same as the Xbox version with a few tweaks here and there without nearly enough improvements to make the game worth while. For an Xbox game it is ok, for a 360 game it is not nearly as good as expected.The game feels rushed, maybe in hurry to cash in on the release of the 360 for which not nearly enough good games are available for it."
2,Moto Gp 2006 has Issues,"Hello all, i'm from spain,In addition to all the defects of which already they have been spoken other exist that do not allow to catalogue this title of ""next gen"", for example:Cockpit view: Simply it is an insult to the intelligence of the buyers.There are no commissioners in track.The public in 3D is little, and badly distributed.The TV cameras do not have operator.The Wall (pit lane) is absolutely empty.The old trick to put a noise in the middle of pit lane, for example in Losail, is stupid.The wheel chain of the bikes does not have movement.The particle effects are seen only in certain circuits and certain types of grass.The slicks are not stained.In rain you have only tyre slicks.Surely that you still find more things...Of course which they are not things that perhaps matter for a race game, but had created an immersion sensation which now the game lacks."
3,MotoGP Xbox 360 is shiny new paint work on the exterior and rusty old bolts on the interior,"1st impressions were favourable, the sound of engines, imagery of motorbikes it all looked very professional and led me to believe I was in for a real treat. Bike selection was straight forward enough even for a game novice like myself. Next came the bug bear. Once into a race it became clear that the set up of the bikes was wrong, the movement was wrong, the weight shifting of the rider was wrong, I would loose control in areas of the track I felt safe in. Fury set in all too quickly."
2,Eye Candy With Sour Center,"Great graphics, yes. Gameplay BITES. In addition to bug mentioned in other reviews, it is very difficult to control your bike. I mean, ""somebody greased the track with shortening"" difficult!I played the free demo, and admittedly it was tolerable. What do you expect from a pre-release demo, right? Then MotoGP06 hit the shelves and (thankfully) I RENTED this title for 5 days... I PLAYED it for 1 day, and it collected dust on my shelf the other 4 days (I think at one point I actually decided to mow my lawn instead).Very disappointed with this lackluster effort in gameplay."
3,Control Control Bike Control,"I think I'd have better luck pulling a I dream of Jennie head bob to get the bike to stay on the road. This game takes the fun out of the first time open and play factor b'cos you can't keep the bike on the road. This one takes a lot of practice and isn't on of those games you can have your friend play with you if he/she hasn't played b'4, so that kills the fun aspect of the multi player game. Believe me when I say if your the type that gets upset when playing videos games this one you might wanna skip. The only reason I learned to control the bike is b'cos after buying the game and getting frustrated after several days of trying to keep up with 15 other bikes, I had a choice.........either use this fine 360 game as a beer coaster or force myself to finger out how to control the bike and get my $60 worth out of the game. If I could have done it all over again I would have bought Quake 4."
1,"This is just crazy, I'm seething!","MotoGp 2006 would be acceptable if it were not for all the bugs. Screen tearing is not a genuine bug and does not cause my 360 to crash, so I can live with that. Not being able to see other riders artwork while online seems strange but again does not cause the game to crash so I can live with that, besides which I`m not into designing my own art. What does bother me though, is loosing saved data. When MotoGp loads and goes into demo mode, should the player press start it does an auto save and saves over all your previously saved data before it has a chance to load your original data. This is just crazy, I'm seething!"
3,Exercise DVD for seniors,"I found this DVD to be too slow and boring. Though I am a senior, I needed something to pump me up, and this did not."
4,exelent light strip,"The led lights are bright and easy to install. I would have prefered that the leds would have been closer together, but the worked as advertised."
5,One of the best I have ever read,"I just finished The Bear Comes Home and I really loved it. It is so wonderful to be rocked out of reality while reading about a talking, sax playing, sometimes sensitive, sometimes bearlike bear. I laughed and I now look at the world in a whole different light. The jazz theme was new to me but I enjoyed experiencing music through words."
5,Don't be put off by the fantastical premise,This is the best evocation of what it feels like to play jazz that I have ever read.
1,Impenetrable and boring,"Probably the first problem is that I'm not a musician. And while I like jazz, I'm not consumed by it. It seems being a jazz musician is a requisite for enjoying this book. I wanted to read a book that propelled itself on plot, on character development and on some sort of emotional connection. Instead, I found a book whose writing mimics a jazz riff -- technically dazzling but self-absorbed and cold. I couldn't get through it."
5,Great travel rollers!!!,"I use full size Vidal Sasson rollers for my ""every day"" hair care. I have been looking for months for a nice set of travel rollers to take on a cruise this past month. I needed the large rollers only (and most sets come with a combination of sizes) . I tried, in the past, the velcro rollers and they do not even stay on my head.These Windmere rollers are great - very compact, quick to heat (within 3 mins) and the clips really do hold. Highly recommend!!"
5,Windmere Hari Setter Quick Heat - Beyond Excellent,"This was one of the best purchases that I have ever made from Amazon!! The curlers heat up and are ready to use in minutes and although my hair is very thick, my curls lasted two days -- longer than when I use my regular set of curlers. Easy to pack, it took up very little space/weight in my suitcase. Well worth the money."
3,Good yet very hot,"These rollers are the perfect size/amount. Two issues, the rollers do not heat up in one minute like advertised, takes around 3 - 4 minutes. They also are extremely hot to the touch but do not burn your head once in. Curl very well."
5,Arkon SR-88 15-inch Flexible Gooseneck XM radio Mount,This is great for XM if you don't want to drill into your car. I purchased this for $29.95 at another website (so this is a good price) and I used it in my Lexus RX-330. It works great as I bolted it onto the bolt for the passenger seat closest to the driver. I did not want to drill into my Lexus to install XM satellite radio. It was really easy to remove the seat bolt and install. My Lexus has a cassette deck so I run my XM through the cassette adpater. XM says this is the best reception for XM (as opposed to the tuner which works as well). I have the XM Delphi SkyFI2 which easily installed into this goose neck radio mount. It is adjustable so you can tilt it to the driver for easy viewing. I recommend this for XM.
3,Found some incorrect information,"Although it was an interesting topic to me personally, as I lived in Saudi Arabia for 12 years, once I saw the glaring error that named Lujean Al-Iman as the Ambassador of Saudi Arabia, I really found it difficult to believe much else written in the book, although I'm sure much of it was true. Lujean Al-Iman is the former wife of Mohammed Al-Massari who has lived in London for years fighting against the Saudi government. I can only imagine that the author must have interviewed her, got his notes mixed up, and then named her as the Saudi Ambassador as making a comment. It was such a over-the-top error that I was shocked. First of all, there has NEVER been a female Saudi Ambassador appointed, and secondly, Lujean is an outspoken critic of the Saudi Government, certainly is not one of their representatives. The publisher/author needs to correct this as quickly as possible..."
5,No problem with this CD,Plenty of Helen Reddys good songs! Only a couple I didn't recognize and don't care for. I'm 57.
4,Great collection from the 1970s vocalist,Helen Reddy is not appreciated for her catalog of songs. This collection will bring back many memories and have you singing her songs after you stop playing the CD.
2,THE WOMAN I AM,THIS ALBUM JUST DOESN'T SEEM UP TO HELEN REDDY'S OTHER WORK. IT SEEMED FLAT LACKING HER USUAL VOICE QUALITY AND PRESENTATION.
5,Dandelions,"This beautifully illustrated(Greg Shed) picture book tells the story of a pioneer family settling in the Mid-West. Mama, Papa and their two daughters, Zoe and Rebecca have left the security of home in Illinois to settle on the Prairie. Papa and Zoe make a pact that they will help Mama feel better about living on the Prairie. After Zoe and her sister plant a patch of dandelions on the roof of their sod house, Mama agrees that their family is hardy and will bloom just as the dandelions are sure to do. This book, told from Zoe's viewpoint, is a touching recount of the feelings of the sodbusters. Would be very useful for primary teachers and media specialists in the mid-west states."
4,Dandelions Rule! :],"My favorite book buddy book is called ""Dandelions"". I like it because alot because it really makes me realise what i have.It's very touching story to read.I realise that how much I really have! I need to be greacous,I need to spend more time with my family,too.It teaches me I need to work and play less.I don't need to ask for everything I see.Now I realize how much I have and that I need to love my family more and more,also appreciate them.This book is great.I love this book.By:Gracen Kerr"
5,dandelions,I picked DANDELIONS because it taught us about the 1800's. And how people lived back then. And how bad it was then. And how hard they tried to get there.The people had to build sod houses. And how people died on the way to the prairie. But when they got there nobody was there. Some people went back. That is what I thought about DANDELIONS.KieDME
3,depressing mother,"If it were not for the beautiful illustrations, I would give it 2 stars. It features a family (Mama, Papa, two girls) leaving Illinois for a new home on the Nebraska prairie. The Mama complains and sighs and chides her husband and makes a big issue out of how lonely she is. Mama is a bummer.The illustrations are heavenly. More Greg Shed, please.Try ""Sod Houses on the Great Plains"" by Glen Rounds instead of this book -- it's more positive."
3,Nice quick intro to the basics,"As the title implies, this is a ""basics"" book. Actually more of a workbook than a book, it quickly covers the basic concepts of inventory management. A little forecasting, a little lot sizing, a little accounting etc.This little workbook could be very useful as part of an in-house training program for workers unfamiliar with inventory management."
1,Not what I ordered,The picture of these tailight covers are not what I received . I received a pair of $30 tailight covers but I didn't feel the need to spend more money having to ship them back at my cost and deal with the headache of trying to get the correct ones. Totally unsatisfied!
4,"Fun game, bad graphics.","The basketball aspect of this game is a little more fun than NBA Live 2006 just because the refs do not constantly interupt gmaeplay. But graphic-wise, this game has the worst graphics than any other sprts game since 2003, I'm talking about the PS2 version. But the close-up graphics are very good. My faveorite part of the game is that you can even do a fantasy draft on play now mode. But if you are a basketball fan you really should get this, it is extremely fun."
2,Still stuck wondering why i bought it :-/,"When i saw this called ""Air Conditioner"" i figured ..YESS.. cool air.. til i installed it and noticed it doesn't make any difference to the pc cooling... it basically sucks air out from the front opposed to the regular fans that suck in from the front and side and let exhaust from the rear of the rig. This is no better than installing a front panel fan facing outward to blow air out instead of in the case. You're better off jst leaving the space open for free flowing air."
1,Too Bad...,"1) The tables arrived several days earlier. Normally this would be a good thing, however, I was out of town and had picked the delivery date I did so I would be home when FedEx came. The large heavy box was left at the front desk of my building. Which was encumbersome for the office staff.2) The tables were alot DARKER then the picture posted. Didn't really match my decor.3) The largest table had a scratches and dents on the table top.4) Needless to say, I returned them. The return process was fairly easy though and I was given a full credit."
4,i like it!,"got it for my daughter's birthday. size is just right, though the bag is darker than the ones posted here. it comes with a tie and really cute as giveaways for the kids."
4,Cross Stitch Garden Motifs,A truly wonderful book for cross stitch lovers. The motifs are easy to stitch. The graphs are also easy to follow.
4,Medieval town to death camp to tourist spot: Auschwitz,"An in-depth study of a Polish town, infamous for the Nazi death camp. The authors place this dark history within the broad context of European history. The focus is of course the camp itself, and the terrible acts committed there, but the inclusion of the town's history certainly rounded out the story."
4,Corbin's Fancy,"As with all of Ms. Millers novels, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and as always with her books it is one that I will keep for re-reading at some future date."
1,Misled,"I was so disappointed by the quality of this book. The starred rating was very misleading. Perhaps all reviews have been made by adolescents. Although the author may have promise, the plot is undisciplined, the characters undefined and the conversations are childish to say the best. I have been taken in by reviews of another book of similar quality. They obviously are not to be trusted."
2,Early Books Not So Great,"Once I got in to this book, I could easily tell that it was written (very) early in her career. Thank heavens her plot and writing style got better as she went along. I have no plans to buy any other titles in this series."
5,Corbin's Fancy by Linda Lael Miller,I've read a lot of her books and especially like those set in the old western times. This one held my interest and was easy reading.
1,Not worth reading,"I am a LL Miller fan, but this book was a huge disappointment. If I hadn't known better, I'd swear it was not written by her, but a ghost writer helping her to meet her quota. The characters were shallow, the story riddled with strange information that was not relevant at the time it was written. The characters have sex almost immediately after meeting and Fancy is suddenly in love with Jeff after a mere 48 hours at best. Totally unrealistic. He threatens to expose her to her nemesis and in the very next sentence, she is agreeing to marry him. What happened here?? I was so disgusted, I stopped reading it and put it down. This author has MANY other well written stories. Skip this one and go for one of the others. You'll be glad you did."
5,An enjoyable read,"I love this author and read every book she writes. This book is no exception. Iknew from page one that this was my kind of book. She never fails to entertain meand I can hardly put her books down. Amazon always offers the best books, not always by authors that I have heard of before, but I have enjoyed every book I have purchased."
5,I thought that this book was absolutly touching!!!,"If you like Linda Lael Miller and even if you didn't like ""Banner O'Brien"" you'll absolutly love this book! It's sweet, sensitive and it'll make you cry. Jeff is such a manly man, but has a sensitives side that women long for. Fancy is so sweet and you just want her to get everything she needs. The book is wonderfully humorous! A must read!"
1,Fifty Shades of Grey - Frontier Style?,"What a mess of a ""novel"", and I use that term very loosely. What's with the sex starting almost immediately between the two main characters? Good grief, it was horrid. And not even enticingly written. I skimmed over almost all that boring drivel. And, if I had to read the word nipple described as a ""nubbin"" one more time, I was going to scream. Yes, I understand it's a historical novel, but still. And the pacing of the book was horrendous. One minute they are in a house, the next they are ""ravaging"" each other on a train. Huh? When did they get on a train? No segue whatsoever. I would never read another book in this series. Awful."
4,"Good, quick read","If you enjoy historical romance, Linda Lael Miller's book are for you. This is the second book dealing with the Corbin family. The characters are well-rounded. She leaves you wanting to know what happens next with this family."
5,The Restorative Powers of Love & Nature,"this is a lovely book about a woman and a man who learn that even late in life, and under the most improbably circumstances love can happen.Maggie Welles is the widow of a Boston Brahman, who is recovering from a stroke and mourning the deterioration of her garden from lack of care. Tristan mallory is a renowned landscape architect who has been hired to ""recreate Sissenhurst"" by the neaveux riche neighbors next door.through a chink in the garden wall they view each other until Tristan sees Maggie struggling to do her rehab exercises on the uneven gravel garden walk. He secretly builds her a new walk the next night, and from there their relationship grows.The book is a testament to the restorative powers of both love and nature. Just make sure to have a box of Kleenex nearby for the last chapter."
2,A Let Down,"I live and breathe for my next chance to garden and I also enjoy reading so I thought this book sounded very interesting. I was sorely disappointed. The development of the garden image was wonderful. However, the character development was severely lacking and the story was extremely unrealistic. The book might be worth reading simply for the descriptions of the garden and the main character's love for and connection with the garden. If you are expecting a story that is any higher quality than one of Harlequin Romance style, this is not the book for you. Also, beware of the ending - it is very anti-climactic."
5,A Garden Lover's Love Story,"I thought this book was a beautiful love story!! About two people who share their passion for gardening and much much more. Just like the garden that came to life once again, so did the passion they both had hidden in their souls. The author depicts Maggie's struggle with her disabling illness, her children's alcoholism, and her own doubts of being a failure raising her children. Many of these struggles are what women go through at some point in their lives, and one that I can I identify with. Sometimes we need to weed out and discard the bad stuff in our lives, so that we can grow, flourish and blossom in all our glory. I couldn't put the book down. Better have the tissue box handy for this book! Hope to read more books like this one by Kathryn Lasky (a.k.a E.L. Swann)."
5,My favorite read of the summer!,I missed Tristan and Maggie as soon as I closed the book. I told all my friends to buy a copy!
3,Irish American memoir of bootlegging 1920's milieux,"Little known, a memoir of growing up a bootlegger's daughter, and the bootlegger being your mother (the father having absconded back to Aran, where daughter joins him at end of tale), in 1920s on the East Coast. It reads easily, moves quickly, and while it does not add up to a whole lot in terms of literary or sociological significance, it does record the experiences of the 1920s as seen from the other side of the speakeasy door. Despite for its time (1937) what may have been daring tales of carefree rumbuctiousness now tamed by the passage of many more liberated decades, it serves as a useful reminder of a now-vanished ethnic enclave, a scrappy feistiness that it fostered, and an appealingly near-innocent placed within quasi-Dickensian perils."
3,A good read but lacking excitement,"This book is basically an expansion on the underground realms for TSR's Forgotten Realms AD&D campaign setting. As a veteran gamer who probably has more supplements than should be healthy, I found this book to be readable and a good addition for any GM who plans to take his players into the Underdark.While the essays, descriptions and artwork are perfectly functional, the style is a little dry and lacking in excitement. It would probably have read better if the author had adopted a first-person perspective - after all, the title is 'Drizzt's Guide to the Underdark' - and doesn't quite match up to R.A. Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy.I really, really wanted to like this book (being a Drizzt fan) but feel a little dissapointed. The best gaming supplements are those that are written with such enthusiasm and passion that make gamers all want to explore the new locations at once. Sadly this book doesn't do that, although it is still a good read. Just not great."
5,True to its description,... I think it in is nicely finished! the eyes of the miniature cocker spaniel shine when the sun light is on it!
1,"Good for IT, not for Law.","This might actually be the worst book I've ever read. The upside is that there are 22 pages of bibliography, which took the reading pages down to 176. If this book is how the technology world is trying to get ""conservative"" lawyers to update, then they might as well give up because I'd rather read my Con Law book twice than this book. This book is good for IT people wanting an understanding of AI in the legal field, of which there is almost none. A lawyer who desires to implement IT into her firm will have no use for this book. It seems that the editors got to the end of their research and decided to go ahead and put something together that they could charge ninety dollars for."
1,Too Fragile,"This unit is too fragile for use as a traveling laptop. My screen cracked when I moved the unit on my desk (a $699 repair). The attitude at Sony was ""you shouldn't move it by the screen"".... The Sony repair service experience is a horror. I'm going back to my older & sturdier Fujitsu P series."
5,Another Masterpiece by Steve Alten,"Steve Alten's latest book continues to show his talent to write a thriller that will keep you reading until it's finished. Steve has once again shown how he can combine Comedy, Suspense, Action and Horror and master them wonderfully.The Loch has a excellent plot and character diversity. It seems like alot Research has gone into the book. I highly Reccomend this book to anyone who is a Steve Alten or Horror Fan. You wont be disapointed, Trust me."
4,A Great book on an old subject,"Being a monster ""junkie"", I was a bit skeptical to pick up the newest offering from Steve Alten. As a kid, I loved to read about the Loch Ness monster, ect. I was not dissapointed at all in The Loch, it put a new twist on an old legend.The Loch has the feel of Alten's other works while dealing with a fresh new subject, for him that is. The only slight hang up on the book is the Scottish accents that some of the charecters have. Once you get used to reading them though, they go by without notice.Overall, The Loch is a good summer book. Great to have as you are at your local lake. Just watch out for the shadows."
4,"Alten is good, not great but getting there","I like Steve Alten because he does his homework. Similar to Dan Brown, Steve researches and incorporates historical fact and lengend into his novels. I like that a lot.Loch is a good read. If you are on vacation somewhere, this would be a perfect book to read. I would say this book is worth the hard cover price, definitely a bargain at paperback price so pick it up and enjoy."
5,Doesn't get any better than this!,"Steve Alten has outdone even his Meg series, which I never would have thought possible. To have spent my entire life being intrigued and facinated with the story of the Loch Ness monster, seeing this book that was written by one of my favorite authors was beyond exciting. The ability that Steve Alten has for weaving a story of fiction into a story of something that's (real?) rivals James Cameron's efforts to do the same with Titanic. If you're interested in the sea monster genre, then you will absolutely love this book. It easily became my all-time favorite novel before I even finished reading it."
5,Great book..... I read it twice.,"This is a really good, well thought out story.It had me thinking, ""hey,this might actually be possible"". He must really do a lot of research before he starts a book. It's a thrilling story while at the same time not being to far out."
4,John's Comments,"Interesting and compelling. Kept me intrigued and tested my imagination. Lots of interesting subjects; Templars, Monsters,love story, it had everything!!! I liked it...but did not believe much of it....it was good fiction."
3,Will satisfy teenage boys - could've been better,"Steve Alten's ""The Loch"" has an interesting plot going for it and not much else.For centuries people all over the world have been wondering exactly what lives in Loch Ness. Some think it's a dinosaur; some say it's a sea serpent; and still others say it's something completely unknown. With this book Alten has given us his theory and combined it with a story straight out of ""The Da Vinci Code"", resulting in a story that's just as unbelievable as that book.I suspect Scottish nationalists will love this book - if they can get by the horrible phonetics Alten uses for all of his Scottish characters. I had to sound out each sentence to make sure I understood what was being said.This would be a good introduction to horror stories for teenage boys, but true horror fans know that there are much better books out there. Still, I can't help wondering what Stephen King could do with this."
3,"About 50 pages too long, but still a good read","I found the ""diary"" part to be totally unecessary and quite a distraction. I ended up skipping over those parts too. The plot of the book is a good one, but it gets bogged down by too much information about the history of the Knights and the description of some scenes. Still once it gets going it is a pretty good read and like other reviewers have written the main character, Zach Wallace, is quite funny at times. It ends very lightheartedly which surprised me, because I thought for sure one of the main characters was going to get killed. If you are a fan of the Meg series I recommend this book, if not I recommend the Meg series first and then you can move on to this one."
5,Terrific page turner! Does the legend wonderful justice,Great incorporation of fact and legend makes a non believer believe and a believer flip and jump up!
5,E61i Nokia Case - Fit Great,"Cellet case worked great for my Nokia E61i - and fit snug - so it is not too large. I also tried both Krusell cases - but this Cellet is my favorite. It does NOT show the keyboard and screen while on your belt, and the phone is worn horizontal. Phone is easily removed by pushing phone up from a slot on the bottom of the case.The Krusell (Classic 89251) with a clear plastic front, fit very well - but displays your phone face and is worn vertically. This classic would be my choice for a back pack or purse, but my use was a belt - traveling via city train stations - and I did not want the phone on display. The Krusell Pictor (94115) was disappointing as it was overly Large. The E61i swam in the Pictor case and then there was additional space for accessories, etc.No problems with Cellet so far, after 3 weeks of traveling with it."
2,too small for nokia e61i,"It is too small for the nokia e61, it fits but very tight, it needs two hands to put it in or out. I ended up using it for an iphone, it fits well on it."
4,Better than I expected!,Nifty little case case for a Nokia E61/E62. This is my first belt-clip cell phone holster and I was surprised at how well it worked. It can swivel horizontal (where I keep it) or vertical. The magnetic clasp is also a nice touch. The glove leather is better quality than I expected. Good value for the money.
3,ok,"Didnt fit my e62 , as it was supposed to but once ya stretch it out alittle it fits ok, just alittle snugger than I would like"
4,VERY GOOD ITEM,"The construction of the product is excellent, I own a Nokia E61i and was looking for a pouch to hold it. I saw this product and bought it. The first day my phone didn't seem to fit into the pouch, but a couple of days later it was working very well. I am very happy with it and highly reccommend to everybody.Agustin Lopez"
5,Still the best,"Published in 1996: Eight years later, this is still the best book on the subject, and will continue to be for a very long time.This book is excellent. Regarding the final two chapters, that some find out of place and rushed, I have to disagree: it is the only place in the literature where I found a meaningful and reasonable explanation of the questions of evil and ultimacy, which are the essential issues where the debate ends up every time.Of course, anyone opposed to the concept of being under God's sovereignty will find this book abhorrent."
3,Not the first book on Free Will to read,"While I enjoyed Wright's book and consider it a reliable resource for understanding this deep topic, I would not recommend interested readers start their intellectual journey there. Wright deals with an overwhelming amount of technical information the average reader may not be able or...""willing"" to digest. Hence, it would be wise to first read a book like Sproul's ""Willing to Believe,"" which broadly surveys the historical and theological development of free will theism, before embarking on a more specialized work like that written by Wright. I would have enjoyed ""No Place for Sovereignty"" more had I taken my own advice."
1,Broker Rhetoric,"I rate this book a 1 star because I am a lender... this book is a basic promotion that all brokers are good and all lenders are bad. I will put it simply and hold everyone's hand like a small child in my review; if you are by chance a Broker, you will love this man's philosophy, however, if you are by chance a Lender/Loan Originator, he will come off insulting and distasteful, and if you are a new consumer looking for advice as to how to get the best loan program, this book will lead you down a path of ill information. Either way, he does not approach the subject of mortgage lending in an objective way to educate, but rather in a stance to promote those in his field (ie brokers) and slander those in the opposite side of the ring (ie lenders). Disappointing to lead innocent and unknowledgable borrowers the wrong way just to promote your business/field."
5,Even Better Than Their First!,"Though I loved this choir's debut album, entitled ""It's Gonna Be A Really Good Day,"" you can definitely hear musical growth with this CD! Especially in ""The Lord's Prayer,"" and ""Isaiah 48,"" which are my favorites... they have most certainly matured in their vocals! This is an amazing album! If I were you, I'd pick up or download a copy as soon as possible."
4,"Pronouncing Guide to French, German, Italian, and Spanish",The price was right and this item seems easy to use and is very compact.
4,Eddie Bauer Lifestyle Carrier,This item was purchased for our daughter-in-law to carry our new grandchild. Our son and daughter-in-law both seem to find this item easy to put on and to adjust for either of them to carry their baby. They say that it is very comfortable to wear while carrying their 2 months only and the baby seems very comfortable in it.
4,I love this scale,This scale is awesome...large display so it's easy to see. What I love most is I step on with my user number and it tells me my current weight then how much I have lost or gained since the last time I checked then how much I lost or gained since I first began. Then lets me know how much more weight I need to lose to reach my goal. Basically it tells you everything in detail just as if you were weighing in at a weight watcher meeting. It's easy to operate and understand.The only thing I didnt like is I cant seem to erase a users history and start a fresh one. So the 4 users you chose thier information is there to stay. Can't erase cousin betty and start aunt matilda.
5,Best toddler christmas gift,I got this for my 2.5 yr old daughter for christmas. She loved it from the very beginninf. It was difficult to put together but worth it. 6 mos later and she still loves it.
4,Toy Great but company isn't,I don't know of any company that would mail things out without boxing them but this company does! The first trampoline arrived with many parts missing because the box was ripped open. The second box came in a LITTLE better condition BUT at least all the parts were there. IT was for a birthday gift and could not give it to them because of this issue. They need to take lessons in mailing items out!
5,fun exercise,"This equipment is well contructed and my granddaughter was delighted to find it Christmas morning. She has been jumping since before she could walk, she just loves to jump. She had a round heavy duty trampoline, which I found at a yardsale, and used it a lot, but needed someone to hold on to for ""big jumping"". Now she has a built in hang-on handle plus the addition of responsive sounds enhancing the experience. Continuing her physical strength developement and balance skills. Money well spent."
1,Love it...but it broke!,"My daughter loved this toy! It was a pain to put together (my husband and I both needed to do it) but it was worth it because my daughter had so much fun! However, 2 months later (not even, really) and the red cord broke while she was jumping. I realize that this wasn't the most expensive toy around, but it should last more than 2 months and it could've been dangerous!"
5,Great physical fun activity!,"I am glad we had a head start on assembling the jumper. Threading the trampoline took two of us and a little sweat, but the result was well received! Total joy!"
4,Great... with the sound off!,"My daughter has a lot of energy so we needed something that will help her get that energy out. This was the perfect fit. I did take the batteries out, it is way too loud and we don't need another noise maker in our home."
4,Great entertainment and indoor exercise for kids!,"This was a great Christmas gift for my 2.5 yr-old daughter. I did not realize how much fun kids have just jumping up and down, but this toy really keeps her occupied and gets her to use up some of that extra energy of hers :). She could not get enough of it on Christmas. I was a little worried about the durability and safety, but it's been a few weeks now and so far so good. We've even had a few other kids over and no issues at all.Only downsides have been that the sensor to detect the number of jumps did not work at first and we had to play with it a little. Also, it took two guys over an hour to put this together...it takes quite a bit of brute strength.But all in all, it's a great product to entertain kids and provide them with some indoor exercise during the winter."
4,Not bad,"My kids (7 and 2 ) received this for Christmas, and couldn't wait for us to put it together. It took 3 adults to do the job right. I love the fact that it's one ""bungee"" and not springs. I would like to hear from anyone who has this as an outside toy (how it holds up to any weather). I don't like the assembely instructions (very vague), and I don't like the volume....but my kids can't get enough. Let's see if it will stand the test of time."
3,Super fun...for about 10 minutes,"I purchased this for my son's 4th birthday. I hand never seen anything like it until we were at a play group that had one. He really seemed to like it so as soon as I got home, I ordered it from Amazon. The pros and cons are as follows:Pros:- Easy to put together- Sturdy...my son constantly sits on the handle bars and it doesn't tip or break- Fun for short periods of timeCons:- takes up a LOT of space. Would be nice if the handlebars folded down for easier storage.- The music function is useless. It has bad sound and is always coming undone under the trampoline section.- only fun for a short amount of time - usually gets bored after about 5 minutes.All in all, for the price, I would say don't bother."
2,Beware of bouncing over the handlebar,"My son nearly bounced over the handlebar on this. It is a great toy, however, depending on the child and their level of energy and fear of nothing it could be dangerous. My son is very tall and skinny, full of energy and a thrill seaker. When i first got this toy, he didnt show that thrill seaker side and it was great for getting out lots of energy inside the house. Then as he got a little older I had to move up to a different trampoline with a net around it. The Airzone, for indoor use."
4,jump smart for spect need child,"I like the shape and ferm base, but the music sensor on the bottom is to far down for a light weight child. I love the way my child with down enjoys using it."
5,Jump safe trampoline,My 2 year old granddaughter enjoys this very much. She jumps and it helps get a lot of excess energy used up! I recommend it. Quality is very good.
2,It is a shame this toy is such bad quality,"My mother bought this for my 3 year but my 5 year old and cousins loved it. We made sure no one over 65 lbs used it but maybe the older (still light) kids jumped too high on it. Within 2 months the material had frayed to the point that I am afraid to let anyone use it. It is a great concept, and the bar is a good plus, but it was incredibly poor quality."
4,Wonderful but broke after 3 months!,"My kids and their friends all adore this trampoline. It is great indoors for rainy days or evenings too. Santa brought it for Christmas this year and Mom and Dad put it together. It was a chalenging job but we did it together in about 45 min. I wouldn't want to do it myself because it is difficult to attach the elastic cord. Like the other reviews, you do have to make minor adjustment here and there but it's no biggie.Our complaint is that the whole thing just broke! A friend was jumping on it who weighs 70lbs. and the elastic cord pulled apart and broke in the middle of her jump.We are looking for the contact info for the company and hoping that they will replace the cord and maybe the mesh that the kids jump on. The riveted holes may be too sharp and caused the elastic cord to break?I gave this product a 4 becasue over-all it is great and the kids love it.I hope the Co. will replace the parts!A Mom of a 3yr & 5 yr old."
4,...worth it cause I love my nephew!,"Bought this for my nephew who loves to jump on/off of beds..figured he should learn while he leaps. He couldn't wait for us to put this together (a lil complex, but worth it) He loved to see just how high he could get, and I felt better knowing that he had the safety of the handle-bars to help. My lil' niece could barely reach the handle-bars, but she already showed an interest in jumping on it herself. Overall, it was worth the money spent to see the smile on his face. Loved it!~Alneka~"
4,Great Toy,I bought this toy for my 3 yr old for Christmas. It did take 2 of us to put it together but it was definitely worth it. It has been 6 months and my daughter is still playing with it frequently - I can't say that for many of her other toys!
4,My kids LOVE this - my husband HATED the assembly!,I have 2 boys - a 2 yr old and 3 yr old. They both really like this and are on it every day. It is entertaining b/c of the music it plays and it is good exercise for them. I feel it is a safe item - neither have gotten hurt on it yet! I would highly recommend this to anyone w/ small children. Only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is b/c of the difficult assembly.
3,bungee cord broke in 6months & was really hard to find a replacement,"My 5-yr daughter received this for Christmas & she used it almost every day, but after 6-months the bungee cord broke while she was jumping. She got hurt a little but was more scared. It has taken me a long time to find a replacement bungee cord, but I found one by this company. http://www.1800trampoline.com/jumpsmarttrampolinereplacementparts.aspxI am including this to save some time for others. I am hoping now she will not be too scared to get back on it.I have not received the bungee cord yet, but I will try to review back to see if it works."
3,"Fun, but quickly broken","My kids ages 3 and 8 both love this trampoline, indoors and out, until the bungee broke after less than a year. I had to email the company and send the broken bungee to get a new one which took several weeks."
4,Fun read...,This was my first Geralyn Dawson book. It was a fun read. I enjoyed the characters and the story. I couldn't put it down and read it in a few hours. I would recommend this book and plan to purchase some of her other books on Kindle.
4,Bad Luck turns Good!,"Trace and Jenny are great together! Then add characters like the Menaces and Monique and you have a wonderful read! This story was very heartwarming. Trace and Jenny really work as leading characters. They have alot of chemistry. The ""superstition"" storyline was a little weak, but other than that it was a book worth reading. The best part was the Epilogue! Too cute! I will for sure read the rest of this series!"
2,"Good potential idea, but this is a lust book, not a romantic one","I wasn't looking for a book that took a lot of brains to read. Just something light hearted. This starts out with a good idea, but it doesn't take very long to see that while the main character thinks of love, it is lust on her mind. Her mom (character is an adult) even tells her to look for lust and then love comes. I gave up less than a third of the way through because I wanted a good story, not a story where the characters constantly have a hard time thinking because they are lusting for each other."
5,wonderful book,"I enjoyed this book, it's a great read! I read for my own enjoyment and I don't pick books apart based on how I think the book should have been written. Worth getting!"
4,cute story,"This is a really cute story line. Combining the wild west, romance and high fashion!! I think anyone in the mood for light romance and a bit of adventure will enjoy this story. It's not going to be winning any major literature prizes but it is an enjoyable read for the train or traveling."
4,Enjoyable Frontier Historical with a suspense twist!,"Good characters and quick pace in the plot. This book has mayhem, romance and a dash of suspense! I enjoyed it, hope you will too!"
5,The Bad Luck Wedding Dress,Very interesting and good book to read. Enjoyed every bit of the book. Will continue to read all the books in the series. Kept my interest and would recommend reading to everyone.
5,Bad Luck Wedding Dress,"This is a ""I can't put the book down"" book. I will look for more of this series. I really like this writer, Geralyn Dawson."
4,A fun and interesting read,"Not being too familiar with romantic novels, I found this to be fun and entertaining. The author has an easy style that keeps your interest from beginning to end. A good read when you need to unwind."
3,Typical Love Story,"To me it was a typical Love Story. I've read about a million of them. Didn't say that I didn't like it, because I did. Nothing earth shattering or surprising in this book. I did guess the correct ending. All in all not a bad book."
3,"OK, but the studio versions are better","Probably the best bit of these sessions is the marriage of Nuclear Device and Genetix. But I have to say, these aren't nearly as good as the studio versions (especially Goodbye Toulouse). One the other hand, the liner notes do put the sessions in an interesting context about what they were trying to convey on John Peel's show. Still, I would suggest looking at the songs listed here and getting the studio albums on which they originally appear."
5,Great for paninis,I bought this product to spice up my paninis. And it does the job!When the use date gets close - I start using it to zest up tuna salad - YUM!
2,could be better,"I ordered this a sa gift for a friend and when it arrived I was a bit disappointed with the product. The actual paints were very nice and fair quality. The amount of the paint supplied was too little considering the price tag. The tray that held the paints was very flimsy too. I feel for the amount of money spent on this, it could have had more paint and had better packaging."
2,Rollers are terrible,"I have had to replace the rollers numerous times. Quality of rollers are terrible, they will flatten out after a while and will make it hard to go up and down. Do not leave any weights on it when not using. Otherwise it is a very good product when rollers are good."
4,Very good introduction to classic tales,"Maybe the title will get you a little mixed up. This book is noit a deep, scholar-like study of myths and legends, it is an easy to read compilation of classics from early northern europe. From Irish to welsh, to celtic myths, the stories presented here are retold by the author in a modern way, and I feel no omition has been made, from a non scholar point of view.I'm sure there are deeper and more intricate books about Celtic Mythology, but this one is a must for starters or fans alike.Included are many, many tales about kings, castles, quests and magic, and the author remains true to the spirit of the time, and you'll be surprised to read the original telling of the classic Cinderella.In all, a very good read, (More than 600 pages, dozens of tales) for kids or adults alike, and a good introduction to Celtic Mythology."
4,a fun read,"I enjoyed Ellis' tellings of these old tales very much. He has done a good job of collecting and collating them, and his style is clear and concise. I particularly like his tellings of ""Bran and Branwen,"" and ""the Quest for Olwen."" Also, Ellis' introduction is very informative."
1,A waste,"I am disapointed that this... author... is so biased. It puts a damper on the book. The introduction is long and winded to say the least but I trudged through it all. I was so eager to dive in to the pool of knowledge contained within this work but I am not so eager now seeing how biased this person is.This person refers to the original writing of the tales as ""glossed up"" and attemps to delete the ""gloss"" in *his/her* retellings. Who does this person think he/she is?I didn't pay for someone's hacked up, mangled and mutilated *version* of celtic myths and legends."
3,History seems to be the very first thing which wants debunking,"A stuffed world is sure to exist And charming outlook,devoid of real thoughts I see a bloody sword brandishing in the midst Divine,I say, and cursed who deplores."
4,Simply the best description of the training scale around,"As a relative new-comer to dressage I have struggled to understand the so-called 'training scale' and how I can apply it in my training program. This book was the ""ah-hah"" moment for me - it really explained what the training scale is about and how to obtain the qualities we are looking for by doing classical dressage.What I really love about Von Ziegner is that he is prepared to subject the training scale to proper scrutiny and criticise it (or its manifestations) where it does not work. He has developed a 10 point 'training tree' which to my mind makes far more sense than the 5 level scale. It would take a more advanced rider than me to fully explain the differences, however this book is equally useful for advanced and novice riders who want to improve their riding and training.This is a book to read and re-read, to gain more each time and revise your training program accordingly."
5,"Timeless, a Must Have for any Dressage Library!","This excellent book is one you will leave out on the end table & refer to many times. Timeless, written so riders of any level can understand, but with great depth that will have even the aspiring FEI riders refering to it time & time again."
5,Wisdom Applied to Basics,"This is an excellent book. Every horse presents a unique situation, and it's easy to forget the basics of the discipline of classical dressage. Von Ziegner presents a clear model based on the German Training Scale or the Pyramid of Training. He suggests changes in the Scale based on his experience and offers a rationale for each change. His changes and rationale ring true to me. I have ridden the test designed by this knowledgeable man, the Prix St James test, and loved it. I am sorry that it is rarely offered in shows today. Sometimes sequence matters, and training a horse is one of those times. Von Ziegner has the sequence right."
5,Fabulous Book!,"This is a wonderful book. I bought a copy for myself, and liked it so well that I bought one for a friend. Neither of us rides dressage, but want to apply the principals to our general riding. The writing is clear and very informative. It has certainly helped me relax my horse, and it has also helped me become more focused on lightness for both of us. Highly recommend!"
5,Superb!,"I finally understand the exercises and reasoning behind them! This is an excellent, and fast read. Not long and boring at all. Lots of diagrams that show proper bend and foot falls. Concentrates on the basic training necessary to any equestrian sport! I will refer to it for many years to come."
5,Fill in the gaps of your horsemanship,"I am very enthusiastic about ""The Elements of Dressage: A Guide to Training the Young Horse"" and will be recommending it to my friends and students.The author's instructions are written clearly and are plentifully illustrated with diagrams and photos.As well as dressage riders, Western Pleasure and Western Horsemanship riders will find this book to be amazingly applicable to their favorite events. All riders will find that this book is both a wholistic and a specific guide to good horsemanship."
4,The Elements of Dressage: A Guide for Training the Young Horse,"This is a book that should be mandatory reading for all aspiring Dressage riders, as well as those who train and start youngsters! This book provides detailed descriptions as well as a thoughtfully laid out format. Kurd follows the German training tree - with one exception that makes sense and gets results quicker! Read the book to find out what it is!"
2,NOT as pictured and NOT for Sirius Starmate 4,"I bought this item for the Sirius Starmate 4. First, know that the pictured item is not the actual product you will receive. This product DOES NOT have a gooseneck design. Second, the mounting plate blocks the audio out and power ports on the rear of the Starmate 4 car dock. Therefore, this product is useless for this particular Sirius receiver. Needs a universal mounting plate that does not interfere with radio connections on the rear."
1,Real problem with Monte Carlos,"The Arkon Satellite Radio cup holder works well, but not in a late-model Monte Carlo. In the forward holder hole, it interferes with the shifter. In the rear cup holder, it keeps your hand away from the factory armrest."
5,Not just for satellite receivers!,I bought this item hoping it would be suitable for mounting the control head to my ham radio (Yaesu FT-7800 with YSK-7800 separation kit) in my SUV (2004 Ford Escape). It meets this need perfectly. I'm thrilled with the result.
4,Works as advertised - inexpensive but a bit flimsy,"This cup holder satellite radio mount works as advertised. With an adjusting screw to expand/contract the base of the unit it even fits well in a the strangely-shaped cup holder of the center console of my 1999 Ford Taurus. But the cup holder is made entirely of plastic and just snaps together, so it feels a bit flimsy to me. Then again, it was pretty cheap, so I can't complain too much! Much easier than installing a permanent satellite radio mount in my dashboard for my Sirius radio!Please note that the center 'stalk' of this mount is about 6 inches tall - so depending on how the cup holder is shaped in your car and the thickness of your radio, the top face of your satellite radio might end up 7-8 inches above the face of your cup holder!"
4,Cup Holder Works Well,"Since my 2000 Grand Am has very limited space for mounting and/or sticking anything to console/dashboard area, the cup holder was my last hope. It's still a bit crowded, but if I position it just right, I can still get to my heat/ac controls. Working out well, but needs occasional adjustments."
3,Good idea if you have a lot of cupholders.,"Great way to mount your XM radio, iPod or other product if you have the spare cupholder. I have used one of these for a GPS years before and bought this one for use with an XM receiver. Holds securely, tightens into the cupholder and is the correct height for my vehicle. Shaft allows me to wrap extra cables around it and make for a cleaner look in the car as well. Decent price, have seen them cheaper in the past but still worth it to have less clutter hanging off of your dash."
4,Horrid Henry Strikes Again,"""Horrid Hentry invents a time machine and promises to send his brother, Perfect Peter, to the future (as soon as Peter puts on one of Mom's dresses). But when Peter gets there, it isn't exactly what he had in mind In fact, everything kind of looks the same ...""In the continuing tales of Horrid Henry, this second book contains the following stories: ""Horrid Henry's Hike,"" ""Horrid Henry and the Mega-mean Time Machine,"" ""Perfect Peter's Revenge,"" and ""Horrid Henry Dines at Restaurant Le Posh.""Following the tale of Horrid Henry's little brother, Peter, I was laughing out loud at both boy's antics in ""Perfect Peter's Revenge."" Poor Perfect Peter, having to put up with a brother like Horrid Henry. This time he swears Henry will never trick him again."
1,useless,"This is the most useless thing I've ever bought. If it were free, I wouldn't be able to find a use for it."
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED,"The reason this review is getting ONE STAR is because I can't give it NO STARS. It has nothing to do with the product but rather the seller. The picture is of a HOYA filter and nothing in the amazon advertisement said this would not be a HOYA filter. Then when it arrived it came in a scratched up case that looks like it's been banged around on a shelf for 30 years. Then on my invoice the seller puts the following comment ""Please read!!! Made by Hoya for Calumet, with Calumet Labeling **Price Slashed**"" The seller can say what they want after the fact on an invoice, but this is not what I ordered and the Amazon seller info is VERY MISLEADING! Buyer beware of this seller!!!"
3,Beautiful but Disappointing,"This is an attractive and useful book and worth the price.However, for those hoping to get anything even vaguely approaching the detailed and absorbing AIA Guide to New York, which meticulously notes even fairly minor old buildings, be ready for disappointment. This is more akin to a tourist picture book than the AIA's New York City effort."
2,WHAT ABOUT THE GOLD COAST,"I have read many of these AIA Guides and I normally love them, but this one is a huge disappointment, honestly it is the worst I have come across. The buildings chosen are bewildering, I mean how many hideous 50's style buildings does Long Island have? When I think of Long Island architecture I think of Oheka or Planting Fields or Old Westbury, the grand Gilded Age mansions so beautifully described in Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, not some tract home in Levittown. I really would not recommend this book to anyone, the American Institute of Architects should be ashamed of this incomplete, lazy guide, they are so much better at these kind of books, if you want a great AIA guide, look at the one on Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, New York, and Detroit, now those are great guides to be proud of, it really makes you wonder about the quality of architects on Long Island..frankly their idea of what constitutes architecture worthy of being in an AIA guide is just totally perplexing."
5,Intense,"I heard the song ""ten signs you should leave"" like 3 months ago or more, and i'm not gonna lie, i hated it. I hated the weird talking that he does. It was so out of the ordinary and weird. But i loved his scream and everything else about the band. I had kinda forgotten about the band until the other day when i was browsing around in best buy. I thought ""ah what the hell, i'll give it a listen"". I first heard the song ""ten signs you should leave"" again, and was still a little annoyed by those vocals, but i listened to the rest of the song and realized it was awesome other than that. By the time track three had finished i was stunned. WHAT AN INTRO!! The tremolo effect on the scream in the beggining is killer. I listened to the whole album and was just amazed. Its nothing groundbreaking, but its just damn good. Very heavy metalcore/hardcore/deathcore stuff. My new favorite band at the moment. I recommend it to fans of I killed the prom queen, and stuff along those lines."
3,Decent. Sound like The Acacia Strain too much.,I was a bit disappointed. its a great album but sounded waaaaaayyy too much like the acacia strain. The vocals are what set them apart. The songs are good but a bit on the short side. not much in this review but just buy acacia strain. theyre better and it wont upset you that these guys are copying them.
1,"JUN JUN JUN JUN JUN JUN JUN, etc.","This album sucks. Don't get it. It's a disgrace to hardcore. If you want hardcore, look for something by Bad Brains, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, etc. Or if you want something by more modern bands, an album by either Paint it Black or Ceremony will do.This, however, is crap. Nothing but breakdowns. No speed, no real ""intensity"". Just cookie-cutter metalcore we've all heard a thousand times before. Hell, there are even good metalcore bands out there who can actually make decent music, if this is what you're looking for instead of normal hardcore: Every Time I Die, Shai Hulud, Between The Buried And Me. Get something by these bands, or the ones listed in the first paragraph instead.But not this garbage."
4,Nightmare On Iwo,"I found this book to be very readable. It has an easy flow from beginning to end that keeps your attention. The author is a good story teller. He includes rich details of his memories of individual personalities he met along the way, as well as vivid descriptions of the battle as he experienced it. This is another good memoir of the struggle for Iwo Jima. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this campaign from the perspective of the soldiers who were there."
3,decent little primer,"nothing really new here. Adapted newspaper article. Its basic and is easy reading. If you are looking for an in depth study of Iwo, this is not the book for you. If you are looking for a very basic understanding. You might enjoy this."
3,Practical Camera for size,Decent Camera for the price. It also charges with cell phone chargers. I found out that my friends cell phone charged my camera (which is good because I use a lot for my son). I bought a memory thing (the ones you put in camera) and it hold MANY pictures like 200 plus I dont remember. I take medium pictures because I dont like the large gigantic ones.
2,"Not impressed, neither were my children","This game was a waste of my money. Luckily I bought it when it was dirt cheap here on amazon before Chrismas last year. The handheld console is hard to see on the screen. The children did not enjoy it one bit. When you have products like the Wii, playstation 3, nintendo ds, etc. kids do not find these games any fun."
4,VMigo,"Vmigo is everything is promises to be- a virtual pet. I bought two, one for my 6 1/2 year old daughter, and one for my 11 year old sister. They both LOVE them. Very simple set up, very simple to learn to use. My only complaint is the handheld piece is not very easy to see the screen, and not easy to turn off.That being said, I am happy with this purchase!"
4,Stone Soup Magazine,"Stone Soup Magazine is a really great magazine. It features work from kids all over the country. I really enjoy the colorful illustrations and exciting stories, and like how it's written by kids just like me!"
5,It's a hat,"What can i say? I keeps out the sun, and it fits great. Non-otaku think its stylish, and those who know bleach think its cool; win-win!"
4,blockaderunners,"this is a great mid length book. its a quick, fun and suspenceful story. perfect for a weekend read. i will definitely read again very soon."
2,"This is gorgeous, but was delivered broken","I purchased this as a Christmas gift, but it was delivered to me broken. When I tried to exchange it, there were none left in stock. I was pretty disappointed since it's a beautiful mug."
4,GREAT!,"THIS MUG WAS FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO IS INTO MUSIC AND HAS A LOT OF STYLE. THIS WAS RIGHT ON POINT IN EVERY WAY. THE MUSIC NOTES AND PIANO KEYS SAYS ""SING""! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS ITEM."
1,can't support it,"This guy's ideas are half-baked, and I was encouraged by my spiritual father to stay away from his teachings. Ask respected clergy whenever you undertake any readings."
1,fundamentalism at its worst,"I keep this little gem of a book on my shelf so that I may refer to it whenever I feel even slightly inclined towards fundamentalist or exclusivist thinking. It effectively snaps me out of it every time. This book is testimony to the fact that fundamentalism separates and creates disunion amongst people and not the opposite. A narrow-minded, paranoid, finger-pointing read."
3,Mediocre,"Father Seraphim, an orthodox convert, dismisses out of hand anything that is at variance with Orthodox Teaching. Unfortunately, he also rejects much Patristic teaching (a rejection, which, of course, is characteristic of Orthodoxy when that Patristic teaching concerns Rome). His position on the Charismatic Movement is not only wrong, it ignores clear patristic evidence to support it. At the very least, I would recommend ""Charismatic Gifts in the Early Church"", ""The Charismatic Theology of St. Luke"" and ""A Pauline Theology of Charismata"" to counter his false teaching. May God forgive him."
1,There are much better books out there from Fr. Seraphim,"Fr. Seraphim introduced many westerners to the Ancient Apostolic Faith during his earthly life.I do not believe that this book, however, reflects that reality very clearly.He draws from questionable protestant evangelical sources (like Constance Cumbey and Dave Hunt)and the book reflects their works in both content and style.If you're interested in Fr. Seraphim there are much better options."
2,Solid Writing with One Great Error,"In His book Fr. Seraphim does a great service in warning New Age people about strange cults and other issues. However, despite being a wonderful writer and warning about many real dangers, he writes strongly against fellow Orthodox Christians, as well as Pentecostal/Charismatic Christians. Strangely Fr. Seraphim attributes the charismatic movement to the devil.Other Orthodox Christians disagree with Fr. Seraphim's assessment:The following links are two sites explaining views contrary to Fr. Seraphim's[...]Pathway to Orthodox RenewalLike many things if you can chew the meat and spit out the bones, I recommend this book. In other ways its highly relevant."
1,Another clunker...,"I've come to see Fr. Seraphim Rose as the radical far fringe Orthodox analogue to far fringe Roman Catholic traditionlists like Fr. Feeny. I'm not speaking to many wonderful and spiritual adherents to the Latin Mass, or to deeply mystical Orthodox brethren, but the hyper-rigid and narrowminded xenophobic radicals that populate the fringes of all religious groups. This book has very little to offer, it is quite uncharitable and Fr. Seraphim betrays a shocking lack of true knowledge of the trends and spiritual traditions he attempts to take to task. There are a few nuggets, ergo the single star, but mostly this is the musing of a hyper-rigid radical, cranking off rounds from a theological bell tower."
1,No ability to cancel,The product was not canceled after a request was made minutes after ordering. My wife had already purchased it as a gift and I wanted to cancel it after she saw that I had purchased it.
5,The Most Spiritually Enlightening Book of the 20th Century,"Blessed Seraphim Rose acquired the Patristic mindset of the Holy Fathers during his lifetime, and therefore was able to understand what was happening in the world around him. This book is an explanation of the greatest heresy of our times, Ecumenism, and how this heresy has already led well-meaning Christians into collaboration with the demonic powers that have been attacking the Orthodox Christian Church for centuries; only now, these powers are appearing in a much more subtle and seducing form. For the most part, this book is a warning of what began decades ago, what is happening now, and what is still to come, and a call for all Orthodox Christians to remain true to the 2,000-year old Holy Orthodox Church."
5,excellent book on the spiritual chaos going around,"The teachings of Father Seraphim Rose are always undoubtfully based on patristic teaching and literature. In this book he is showing that only Eastern Orthodoxy has the true answers for all the spiritual chaos going on all around the world. How right he is ! In his book he is discussing the assaults of all the far eastern religions on Christianity. He writes about the influences of eastern meditation, yoga and zen on the western mind. He explains how all these religions and techniques are incapable of solving man's problems and his need for salvation, because they are satanic.This is one of the best books ever written discussing new age spirituality from an orthodox christian point of view. In this book he shows that not all the ways lead to God, and that salvation can only be attained in the Orthodox faith."
5,A book to keep an orthodox christian on track,"This book is so helpful. When any Christian looks outside the doors of their church, there is so much influence from various religions and spiritual movements. This book accurately depicts an Orthodox Christian view of these influences. From Yoga to UFOs, Father Seraphim keeps a Christian on the right track. This book is incredibly inspiring. It's a well written and informative book needed for the time we live in!"
2,It could have been better..,"80% of the other reviews are well stated at what and why this book is lacking. I stress that you 'jump' around alot and that grammatic and sentence structure rules (deep rules) are not explained. You are expected to just accept (?) and memorize. There are not enough reference pages or appendix to aid with lessons. There are way better books on the market to challenge and (most importantly with language instruction) to motivate. Unfortunately, this text is required for some Canadian universities. If you (the student) are required to purchase this text, I highly recommend the use of companion books to explain grammatic points that this book simply doesn't explain well enough (ie. Japanese for Busy People). Gambatte ne!"
4,not bad for a beginner textbook,"Having taken quite a number of language courses, I think that this book is fairly well done for beginning learners. It explains the grammar fairly good and has a nice amount of vocabulary.My only complaints are that the ""dialogues"" in the book force you to keep looking down at the bottom of the page for English translation. Also it gets wordy with its ""grammatical"" terms like ""past plain non negative polite tense."" Geez.. Why not just say ""past tense polite"" it can get a bit confusing..but its much better than other books..."
2,"""Getting Started"" Took a Whole Semester","This book is poorly organized and gives little independent feedback. In our 100 level class we spent a whole semester just on the introductory section (some 80 pages long). These authors believe that you can't do a thing with Japanese until you've learned kana, but meanwhile they expose you to a myriad of other concepts without explaning anything. The glossary in the back is in kana also, making it impossible for the beginner to find anything."
3,Not really for beginners..,"The good thing about this book is that it gets the student reading hiragana in a short amount of time.The bad thing about this book is that there is not enough grammar support or explanation to understandthe basic sentences. I think it's a difficult book to use without a teacher, and even then, theteacher has to do a lot of explaining, hopefully. Again, this book moves very fast without enoughexplanation. I only bought it because I'm tutoring someone who has this book for a college class.The workbook for it, however, is very useful."
1,Yookoso! An Invitation to Hell,"If you want to learn Japanese, watch anime. But do not buy this book! I've seen better written Japanese instructions on the back of chopsticks. If you're taking a class that uses Yookoso! drop the class, run away, drop out of school if you have to. Any fate is better than learning Japanese from this book. Any half-witted Japanese instructor will know better than to use this paperweight to teach Japanese. If you find yourself in your university bookstore buying this contraption a better alternative might be burning down the school and labeling it, ""not fit for education"". If you have any interest, and more importantly respect for the Japanese culture do not buy this book!However, if you enjoy tedium, monotony, poorly written explanations, learning about 10 grammar rules a day, and take pleasure in reading fictional linguistics then buy Yookoso! It'll be the best waste of [money] you'll ever spend."
3,"Good looking and well made, but difficult to install","I ordered these shelves ready-to-paint and they turned up quickly and as expected. They look and feel well made and go great with our decor. They are not, however, easy to install. The way they attach to the wall is via 5 screws that need to be a) precisely spaced and b) level. This means you will have quite a bit of work to do getting them exactly in-line or the shelf will not attach to the wall. I'm also quite suspicious as to whether this will create a really firm connection. It would be nice if these attached via some sort of bracket anchored with two or three points (instead of five)."
1,No Haitian creole,"I bought this for Haitian creole but there is none on the cd, despite it saying so in the product description. It may be good for the other languages, but since it didn't include the language I bought it for, I can only give it one star.If you want to learn creole, try Languages of the world, Creole made easy or Ann pale kreyol."
5,Beautiful watch.,"I received this beautiful watch as a wedding gift from my in-laws (they let me pick it out actually). This watch is very unique due to the Omega 1270 Caliber Swiss hybrid quartz movement with mechanical chronograph mechanism. The main time is based on a quartz movement, while the chronograph is based on an automatic movement. This is perfect for me as I only wear the watch for special occasions, so I did not want one that is fully automatic (since you have to wind it all the time).The watch is very elegant and classy, and a pretty good value compared to other upscale watches."
4,Nice hydration pack - could hold more water!,"Great hydration pack - very sturdy with excellent features. Very comfortable to wear on long runs. However, it does not hold that much water - if you're going on a long run, make sure there is a place to stop along the way for refills. It is easy to refill. I am glad I purchased the Alterra and just purchased another CamelBak with greater capacity (holds more water)."
2,Just okay,"This hydration pack is only okay. It bounces around at first, but once you tighten it appropriately to your running you don't even notice it. My biggest concern is that it leaks constantly. As soon as you put it on your waist, it starts leaking out the external access. I've used other camelbaks before and I have never had a problem with other bladders. External access is not a good thing! I'm returning this ASAP!"
3,It's Okay.,"I found it hard to fill. I was looking for something small to run with, but a hip-mounted water-bottle holder seems to work better for me."
3,Field & Stream Watch set,"My husband's watch stopped working so I decided to try and replace it with the same brand watch. Field & Stream very hard to find but a very dependable watch. I found it on line at Amazon!!!! It was a great buy and a perfect replacement. The flashlight works great too. Anyone could not go wrong buying here, I know I will."
3,how a democracy can beat two dictatorship,"this book shows how the little democracy of Chile was able to defeat two aggressive dictatorships, despite their secret pact of military alliance against Chile, and how the chilean people could, at great cost, destroy their bigger armies, and thus recover its northern provinces. Its remarkable see that a well organizaced society can defend itself from the aggression of bigger countries greedy for the opportunity to abuse of their neighbours."
1,A closet Klanner speaks out again.,"Now that Strom is dead, the only remaining KKK member in the US Senate is Robert Byrd. A racist for all of his life, who occasionally slips up and uses his favorite terms for African Americans, as he did last year, he now shares with us his observations about George Bush. If you have ever talked to this man, or even worse, seen him in action on the Senate floor, you can only pray that Afghans or Iraqis don't watch him since they'd welcome dictatorship back in a second.This book is so silly that it should come with crayons to keep his admirers occupied. But as the saying goes, there is no fool like an old fool, and Grand Kleagle Bobby fits the bill with this book. I don't think there is a single chapter in this book that rises above the level of a 6th grader, but i'm sure he made a bundle in writing this nonesense, as he has done his entire career."
1,"Okay, I read it!","I am amazed that this longtime senator found a publisher that would publish this laughable peice of literature (and I'm being kind). I would suspect my 18-year-old could write a better thesis than this waste of time. Byrd, who is obviously disillusioned from age, has created a masterpiece of what NOT to do when you want to bash a sitting president. His accusations seem to be hollow, and his arguments seem nearly idiotic. I thought that Senator Byrd would offer a thought-provoking manuscript. Instead, this book has no continuity and sounds like a jealous Mountain State leader whining over someone stealing his thunder. Being that I am a Democrat, I have no reason to slam anything that comes across as anti-Bush. Yet, this does more to help the otherside. I suspect that Byrd's employees have written this book for him, and they made him sound like a 105-year-old goofball. Trust me, this book is really bad! Bad! Bad! Don't waste your money or your time."
1,"Interesting, but is it hypocritical?","A month ago, I might have rated this book in the four star category. However, the author is confronting a reckless and arrogant presidency and looking to regain the constitution. Despite this claim, and primary focus of the book, the author is on the record in the Senate in July 2004 as voting, in the minority, to write discrimination into the U.S. Constitution by voting for the Federal Marriage Amendment. It truly begs the question of credibility for this author on his ability to criticize others about defending the constitution and the rights of others. Therefore, his rating, in my humble opinion, drops for lack of credibility."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this card for the same reason others did - to upgrade from the PC5740, which has been fantastically reliable but could be faster. Unfortunately, the unit kept losing the signal - in areas that that 5740 handled with ease (for a while I was commuting from RI to NJ on the train, so it was a great apples-to-apples test). Try as I might and with Verizon support (they mostly suggested I do the same things I'd already tried), I simply could not get it to hold the signal, and getting the signal back was a buggy, bothersome process. So I gave up and went back to my 5740, which works even when traveling by train through the Great Swamp in RI and below ground in Penn Station. I will switch to an faster card when I am convinced I can get the reliability of the 5740 at a faster speed."
4,"With the PC5750, Verizon service beats anything ATT has to offer","I tried using an ATT USB 881 modem AND an ATT Option GT Max 3.6 card for my train trips from Morristown NJ to Grand Central and in the building I work in near Grand Central. Of the two, the GT Max was slightly faster. But the ATT network was like an intermittent dial-up connection; real slow, and lots of drops.Before closing the ATT account, I opened a Verizon account with a PC5750 EVDO Rev A PC Card. It's almost like a cable connection; 10x as fast as the ATT network, and a good connection ALL THE WAY from Morristown to Grand Central, although signal strength varies. I'm writing this in the tunnel as we approach Grand Central, and I still have 4 bars. The ATT network was long dead by this point in the trip. I'm going to return all the ATT equipment and close that account before my 30 day trial runs out! I have no experience with any other Verizon cards, but I have no complaints with the 5750!"
1,Poor Performance,"I live in the Midwest. I ""upgraded"" from the 1xRT Serria card to this card to get the higher speed data rates. I travel a lot in my job and have yet to see anything greater than the 1xRT speeds I had with the last card. I have contacted Verizon in the past and they are not helpful.. All they are interested in is getting you to extend your contract. My advice is to go with the Sprint service, my coworkers seem to have good luck with them."
2,WARNING: MONO RECORDINGS,"I have this same exact CD (at least the artwork is the same), but NONE of the songs are in *stereo*. 0. Zilch.I don't know what disc you got, but mine appears to be a silver CD (NOT a CD-R rip). Black label, ""The Crystals"" in red font, ""Marginal Records CDMAR063 A.A.D. Digitally Remastered. SABAM 1997 ISO9002. Inside ring: ""Disc made by Imation NA21340A 970422"". (Does Imation really master CD's in addition to manufacturing cheap media? Or is this really a bootleg/CD-R w/a painted color label?)Tracks 16, 19, and 25 might have some EQ or echo to give them a sense of narrow separation, but for all intents and purposes, they're mono (by definition, the same exact information coming out of the left and right channels). The mono generally sounds clean, and none of the cuts are obvious ""needle drops"", but I bought this based on your review that it was ""real stereo"". Thanks a load, pal. Another Amazon waste of my hard-earned $20 for something I already have."
3,Not fun for kids,"My 8 year old really wanted this when he saw it. He opened it up, set it on the shelf, and forgot about it. To be sure, it's fun to look at but it's meant to be admired, not played with."
1,Lyrics,"I was very disappointed in the quality of the lyrics on this album to say nothing of the fact that ""Wabash Cannonball"", the title item had no lyrics at all."
2,"Good picture, but ...............","I used watch Sabrina and The Archies back in the 70's like many other kids and eagerly waited for this dvd to arrive so I could enjoy the show again. Well, this purchase is somewhat of a disappointment. The picture is good and clear BUT, the audio is very shrill. It's not distorted, just high pitched and unpleasant to listen to. I tried it both through my stereo system and plain old tv speakers and the results were the same. I'm surprised no one else mentioned it in their reviews. It must be a result of a sloppy transfer job from tape to digital format. I've rented Archie videos in years past they sounded equal to what I heard from the cartoon on tv back in the 70's. The bad part is I've ordered three other Archie dvd cartoons. I hope they don't have the same problem."
4,"Disturbing, thought-provoking, unforgettable","Not too many likeable characters in this movie, but it was a poignant portrayal of finding and losing opportunities for redemption...and in some cases, making one last desperate try just to do something good."
2,SHIPPING AND HANDLING IS A RIPOFF,I ORDERED 4 SETS OF THESE BUTTONS. THEY ARE OKAY FOR THE PRICE AND ARRIVED PROMPTLY. THIS IS MY COMPLAINT. I WAS CHARGED OVER $17.00 SHIPPING AND HANDLING ON A LESS THN $6.00 ORDER. THE POSTAGE ON THE PACKAGE WAS $1.39. HOW CAN THIS SELLER JUSTIFY THIS OVERCHARGE? I CERTAINLY WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS RIPOFF COMPANY AGAIN. IT IS DISAPPOINTING TO KNOW THAT AMAZON.COM ALLOWS THIS PRACTICE.
4,"Great scale, wrong color","We already own one of these scales and have been very happy with it. Great battery usage (haven't had to change them in 18 months), simple operation, easy switching between metric/English weights. We also love the ability to switch between more/less detailed displays, for both metric and English weights. We use this scale for shipping as well as kitchen weighing. Excellent product.We ordered a silver one as a gift and were excited about the color (our black one shows every speck of dust, flour, etc.). However, when it was delivered, it was black. No comment or apology, no prior contact, just shipped a different color. Obviously, the color does not change the product, but we were disappointed that there was no customer service."
4,Digital Scale - Spiffy,"Excellent for use in the home or office. Easy to use, flexible and the options are so practical.Great buy - Thanks."
3,Ultraship 55lb,The actual function of the scale works great and has paid for itself in the amount I have saved in shipping accuracy. That is the plus!The negative is that the screen is very diffuclt to read. It is very blurry! Also the feature for bigger boxes where you pull the front out is not very easy to access. I would recommend this item to someone that uses it for smaller heavy items. Nothing to large in size. Oh and must have good vision.
4,Good product,I needed a scale to help me keep my pack weight down for a long 500 mile hike I am planning. This did the trick. I now use it in my kitchen and it works great.
5,Great Scale,"This is one of the best scales I have ever used. accurate, easy to use, built well. i highly recommend it! And the price is great!"
5,Highly functional low cost postal scale,"For the money, this seems to be a really good value. It appears to be accurate, and unlike other more expensive scales, it covers a wide range of weight. It's small, which I like, although if you want to weigh a big box you'll have to be careful to balance it properly on the platform. The ""Hold"" key is nice for recording the weight of a larger item when you can't see the screen. The manual is badly written, but you can figure it out. Keeping in mind that it's cheap, it seems to be reasonably sturdy. I would not recommend it for a busy mail room. For my purposes, doing a few eBay mailings, it's great."
4,Affordable and great way to avoid post office lines,"I bought this to help with the onslaught of holiday package shipping. It's sturdy and does a great job for weighing absolutely everything. With this scale I was able to use the self-mailing websites of UPS and the USPS (Click N' Ship) and skip the long lines to mail things. For that alone this thing paid for itself. I also like that it can run on batteries! It doesn't give you the price of postage, but you can figure that out with the weights via those websites. They're always changing their prices anyway.A great time saver, I will definitely continue to use this after the holidays for mailing things."
1,Does not work at all,"It doesn't work. It doesn't even hit zero when turned on. The display keeps showing random numbers. This is brand new, out of the box and it doesn't work at all.First the adapter came weeks after as the vendor said that he had run out and would I like to go and get one from somewhere else! It did come eventually.After trying to figure out what could be the matter with the scale, I understand that to recalibrate it requires having specific, heavy weights to get it to zero itself. Who has this kind of equipment? It is still randomly flashing numbers, has never managed to stay still at zero and, when something of known weight is placed on it (1 lb) it keeps flashing between .78 and .65 and (it seems) every number in between.What a waste of time and money. Ordered a USPS scale as a replacement."
1,ultraship makes shoddy product.,"I bought a defective scale from a supplier. I shipped it back to UltraShip for replacement. At first they said they were out of stock on their own product. What kind of manufacturer is out of stock on their on product? Then send back the same defective scale back to me without fixing it. They do not stand behind their product at all. What good is a 30 year warranty if they send back the same defective scale back to you? I used an accurate 10kg weight to calibrate the product like they ask in the manual and the numbers keep jumping around. Their LS-30 model is better (even with the annoying auto-off), but I will never buy an UltraShip model."
1,Junk.,Had it for two weeks and now everything weighs .14 lbs. Won't work. Tried everything and don't have 3 weeks to wait for repair or replacement. SOL.
5,Excellent Product at an Excellent Price,"For several years I have used the PELOUZE model PE5 scale not by choice as it was the only one I could find at the price I could afford.My PELOUZE only goes up to 5 lbs.; and if the box you wanted to weigh was to large, you would have to try to peek in between the box and the scale. The hold fuction on the PELOUZE never worked properly. The PELOUSE would ONLY last about 2 years at best.I just purchased the ULTRA SHIP and am impressed with the features. which is like comparing night with day.A removable display that detaches from the body and lights up (I had to use some Petroleum jelly on the back of the scale to remove it more easily). You can weigh up to 55 lbs, has a TARE, HOLD and auto off feature. Uses 6 C batteries or an adapter (make sure the seller has this feature).I am unable to find any fault the this ULTRASHIP scale which is a different story with the PELOUSE.Bottom line, you can't go wrong with the ULTRASHIP."
2,Defective Scale,"This was to be a second scale for my natural foods buying club to use in weighing bulk items. We already have a Weigh Max shipping scale 150 weight with which we're quite happy.The Ultraship was defective on arrival: One of the digits did not display properly, and thus weights could not be read.Thank goodness for Amazon's easy return process.I would not purchase the Ultraship brand of scale again. I recommend the Weigh Max."
5,Weigh cool!!,"This is exactly what I wanted, an accurate scale that has the capacity to weigh any package I'm ever likely to ship anywhere, but is sensitive enought to weigh a single letter so I can penny pinch on postage. It's compact, readible, accurate, and dare I say fun to use. Finally, the price it right! Who could ask for more?"
5,ultraship scale,"great product so far. Compact, but can handle large weights. Allows for a container to be tared to 0."
4,great scale for the price,"This one comes with the AC adapter. Whoever uses a battery-operated postal scale is beyond me, but in any case the next higher model than this one(the 75 lb scale of the same company that is also here on Amazon) uses batteries as well and does NOT come with the ac adapter, and i never ship anything that heavy so this was the right choice for me, and probably is for most people who have home weighing needs. Sorry to see that other people had bad experiences with this but for me it is working great. Just a reminder that this scale doesn't come with preprogrammed rates and that sort of thing, but if you print postage online with paypal all you need is the weight and they calculate the rest, the same as if you would go stand in the ridiculously long USPS line and go to the window. It also has the following units of weight: Grams, Pound-ounces, Kilograms, Pounds, and ounces. Great product."
4,Review from Long Term User: Reasonably Accurate,"The trick to using this scale is to weigh the item, write the weight on the package, and drop it off to USPS or UPS and ask them to confirm the shipping weight. I found it to be accurate from .6oz - ~45lb. Anything more/less will have a slight variance in the weight of a few ounces. If you are a low weight shipper, then I suggest looking for something else with closer tolerances.Most of my packages weigh in around 3-16 lb. and the scale is very accurate regarding those ranges.I've been using this scale since 2007 and it still hasn't failed me."
1,Not what I expected,"We thought this would be great for measuring out food portions (it is described here as a ""kitchen scale"") and for shipping packages. However, the actual item is not designed for food at all, does not mention it on the packaging, and is not accurate down to the low ounces. Also, it does not come with a power adapter so it requires several C batteries which are not included. The plastic seems very lowgrade and cheap. We sent it back!"
5,Great scale,"When my husband started selling some of his old hobby items we needed a scale to weigh boxes as they were being prepped and shipped. I was also looking for a scale to weigh letters being mailed to family in another state. This scale does both very well. It's easy to read and easy to operate. I like the range this scale can go between. From 1 ounce to 55 pounds it covers a lot. You can also change the units; ounces for letters, pounds for packages, and a few more. We've used it several times already and it's worked great every time. Keep in mind that it doesn't come with a plug."
5,55LB ELEC. SCALE,EXECELLENT PRODUCT WORKS WELL RECOMEND GETTING THE AC/DC ADAPTER GOES THROUGH BATTERIES VERY QUICKLY USES BATT EVEN WHEN UNIT IS OFF OTHER THAN THAT GOOD PRODUCT
5,Fast and easy,"When my other postal scale went out on me, I had to get something quickly. I read several reviews and settled on this scale. I was a little leery about the cheap price but so far it has fit the bill! Time will tell if lasts."
4,Good Price for a Multi-purpose Scale,"This is a nice product for the paid cost. Its multi-range, and multi units, are convenient for dealing with weighing various items. However, you have to manually select the proper range. It would be more practical if the scale adjusts it's scale automatically to suit the item that we are trying to weigh."
4,Good Scale.................so far.,"After considerable research and even more procrastination, finally committed to MyWeigh Ultraship Scale. The price? excellent. The function? excellent. And, it got to my door the 2nd or 3rd day after ordering with Amazon SuperSaverShipping. So dear Reader, please explain how I can complain?TheThriftstoreMountaineerHollywood CA"
1,Item did not work.,"I don't know how this has 5 stars at all. When I got the package, I wish I knew it would not have AC power.When I placed my 1st item it would jump between .1 or .3 oz. It wasn't that bad. The next day I tried again, and it was off 2 to 3 oz. Then when nothing was on it, it would jump between -2 oz to 5 oz. Nothing was on it! I didn't have anything to calibrate it. Sent it back on 7/22/2010. I bought the Escali and it came today. Works perfectly so far. Get that instead."
4,Nice Scales,"Very satisfied with this product. Accurate weights, nice accessories for odd-ball sized packages, fast shipping. Recommend for anyone looking for a small scale for shipping purposes."
5,Review of Scale,This product is absolutely fabulous! Weight is accurate. Very easy to use. And the best part is: no more nasty grams from the post office due to inaccurate weights for postage!
1,RIPOFF! Never worked properly / wanted me to pay shipping!,"If I could, I would give this scale (and this entire experience) ZERO stars. This scale never worked from Day 1. First, it wouldn't even turn on. I had to keep playing around with the batteries in order for it to do so. Finally, when it decided to turn on, the numbers were jumping around all over the place. I had to keep turning it on, then off, then taking the batteries out, and putting them back in....and even then - the weight was off by a number of ounces each time! What a waste of money, time, and energy. There's no way I could actually USE this scale for my business!Worst of all, the supplier (QUICK SUPPLY) wanted me to pay return shipping for their DEFECTIVE PRODUCT, and I refused. WILL NEVER BUY THIS CHEAP PIECE OF JUNK AGAIN, and will never buy from this supplier again!"
1,Not accurate or consistent,"The weight reading drifts on this scale, WELL beyond the supposed 2g accuracy.Example: I put it on my living room table, away from cell phones, microwaves, TVs, and any other electronic device, and turned it on. It zeroed, but within a couple of seconds started fluctuating up and down between -4g and 6g. I left it there for 20 minutes, at which point it read 18g.The manual doesn't say anything about fixing this problem. I haven't tried getting it fixed or replaced because it probably isn't worth the time and shipping expense.I got the model with the AC adapter. Maybe this wouldn't happen with batteries for some reason."
1,Don't throw your money away!,"Bought this scale for my ebay business. It worked for about a month the way it should. Then, I had to ""play"" with it everytime I tried to use it. I'd weigh something 3 times and get 3 different weights. Then it died completely. My brother (who can fix anything) could not get this scale to work. You get what you pay for!! Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,Ultraship 55 lb Electronic Scale,"DO NOT BUY unless you want to ship the unit back at your own expense to the vendor for replacement when yours doesn't work. Our unit was dead on arrival. The displayed values varied widely, would not maintain a stable value, and the backlight display flickered randomly. The vendor refuses to refund shipping charges even though their product was dead on arrival. Their quality control is what you might expect of a fly-by-night operation from an unnamed far eastern country. Our replacement unit shipped was a different color and the backlight still flickers randomly. At least the weight indications seem to be stable for now. We can't justify the cost to ship this one back yet again for who-knows-what in return so we'll live with it. The replacement unit took several weeks to arrive after they received the dead unit."
3,"Good features, defective display.","This scale had all the features I was looking for, and was a very good price and had mostly good reviews so I tried it. When it arrived, I realized that the numbers in the display were only visible if you were looking down from directly above it or up from below it. If you looked at the display straight on, they were invisible!I assume that that was a defect, since there would be no way to read the scale with something on the tray with the display like this, so I sent it back and am not going to try an exact replacement.The scale weighed things comparably to my smaller digital kitchen scale that I have used for years. I think there was maybe a variation of .05 to .1 oz, which is certainly acceptable.I would have kept this scale had it not had the display problems, but because it did I plan to look further for a similar product from a different maker."
1,DOA,"This scale was dead on arrival. Thank goodness for Amazon's easy returns, although the documentation in the box explicitly said NOT to return it to the vendor. Yeah right. Only works with expensive C batteries or an AC adapter (not included, of course). Avoid."
3,pleased,We have had absolutely no problems with this scale. After reading some other reviews I was hesitant to buy this but am now glad to report that ours is problem free.
2,Well you get what you pay for.,Can't say much about this scales it was cheap an you get what you pay for. Over all it is made very cheap an not easy ro read. The indeglow lite is very week an not easy to read. Made of all thin cheap plastic. Not worth the money.Think I'll send this one back.
1,Piece of junk,"Hate to be so harsh, but in my brief experience with this skill I found it to always be inaccurate, difficult to work with lousy instructions. I wouldn't recommend this."
4,"It's a great scale: wide load range, cheap",This scale does the job and it has very good range. The surface finish can be more luxurious but it does the job well. The only issue is that you have to find an A/C adapter for it.
5,Great Product,I bought this scale for my ebay business and I am so satisfied that words alone can't express it.
1,ULTRASHIP 55 lb. DIGITAL POSTAL SHIPPING & KITCHEN FOOD SCALE BLACK,"One day I got it out of the closet to ship a some earrings, and it was completely dead. It simply didn't come on with wall power or batteries. I have used it about 5-6 times. I purchased 4 years ago from Ebay. I received a adapter and it work great. I don't ship much, so I got maybe 3 uses out of the thing total. I paid $15.00 plus FREE shipping. Packed professional. So I am thinking maybe after returned fees I probably just invest in another name brand of scale."
2,Would not recommend,"This scale does not work very well; it worked the first day, after that it gives me wrong weight all the time. I would not recommend"
5,Excellent product!,"This is a great product! Easy to use, easy to read, easy to store. Better than any other scale I've used at work or home for my shipping/mailing needs. Good, quality product, and you can't beat the price! I highly recommend this scale."
5,Great Value,Very accurate - I have never seen a scale with these capabilities anywhere near this price. I use it for UPS shipping and it will do everything I need.
1,This thing really is a toy,"I had to ship things quickly so i order this scale since there were alot of reviews i was like what hell. took forever to receive so i just took it to the postal office. when i finally got it i had to buy freak batteries, no ac adapter. put it the batteries but when i turned it on there were numbers on it. so i look in the manual. it said wait a couple of second for it to warm up, i wait several. looked online, youtube, nothing. then i read that you have to recalibrate it with 10kg weights. where the hell do you get 10kg of weights. sigh.... i hope they give me a new one that works. if not a full refund.This is a update. 05/13/11So i got a e-mail today saying that they are going to give me a full refund cause they don't have any in stock. i think thats bull because they still have the item up for sale. LOL. anyways they also told me to keep the scale trash it keep whatever i want with it. lol i can't stop laugh."
1,BATTERIES AND AC NOT INCLUDED,"They don't even include batteries or an AC adapter. I have never bought a product that does not let you power it on as soon as you buy it. I finally found an AC adapter and the scale was dead on arrival. I would stay away from this scale, seems very poor quality with high rates of error."
1,This Scal Is Not Accurate Or Dependable! Don't Waste Your $$$,"I purchased this scale and it never did weigh accurately,as much as 6 ounces off. When you need exact weights, this is not the one for you. How embarrassing to go to the Post office and them weigh your prepaid pkg and show you it is not accurate, or even worse it comes back due to insufficent postage. It's Cheap in Price and quality. Back here looking for a good scale today. Only rating a 1 star because something is required. Hope the trash diggers at the dump dont find it and think it is worth something."
5,Good product!,I received this about a month ago and I haven't had any trouble with it yet! I run it off battery because everyone says it works better that way so if you are not going to be running it constantly I will really recommend it for you small business shipping needs!
4,Great product!,"I love this scale, we have found so many uses for it. It works great and is easy to use. The only reason it did not get 5 stars was that is does not ship with an AC adapter. I had to purchase that separately. If they came together it would definitely be a 5 star product"
2,Disappointing,"I was also perturbed that this scale does not ship with an AC adaptor. But I could have read more closely, and C batteries are easy to come by. Got the thing up and running and now I see that the last digit of the LCD display does not function. Nice. I just get the impression that this is a cheap product."
2,No AC Adapter,"I am shocked that this didn't come with the AC adapter. Plus, the seller sent the silver one rather than the black one (which is what I specifically ordered)."
1,Don't,"I ordered this scale which came from Quick Supply. It didn't work at all. Not a beep, or a light, not even an error message. I sent it back and wanted my money back, including the shipping charges both ways and got back ""We do not refund return shipping charges"". My advice is, keep looking."
3,Make sure you get the scale you ordered,"I ordered this scale but inside the box for the 55 lb. scale was actually a 35 lb. scale. Clearly, the quality control at this company is not great. So be sure you are getting what you paid for."
2,Misleading Ad,"The product is fine, the ad is misleading. This scale is available from many vendors, many offering it at a lower price. I purchased here because the Ad title said Ultraship 55 lb Electronic Digital Shipping Postal Kitchen Scale WITH AC ADAPTER. When it arrived there was no AC Adapter and in reading the advertizing more carefully I see that it was never intended to be shipped with the scale. When I called the company to talk with them I could only listen to a recording repeating their business hours -- I was calling during their stated business hours -- and suggesting that I send an email. I found the ad misleading and the experience distressing. The same scale is available elsewhere for half the price and the customer service could hardly be worse. I recommend buying elsewhere."
3,"Good Scale, some flaws","This scale seems to operate very well. I've had only one problem with it, and it is a big problem. The instructions are poorly written, obviously written overseas. When trying to interpret the instructions in order to turn off the backlight, I ended up entering calibration mode. To correct this, one would need an accurate 10 Kg and 20 Kg weight. There is no way of exiting ""calibration mode"" once you are in it. You will need to locate some weights and reset the scale. I did the best I could with the weights I had at my house for weightlifting. They are not accurate, and so my scale will never be accurate. FOREVER. unless I find some accurate 10 Kg and 20 Kg weights. Why should I have to go to all the trouble to find or buy these weights? Why can't they have an ""exit calibration mode"" option. And why can't they write decent instructions that make sense and use correct English. That would be step number one for the manufacturer."
5,great value,"this scale works very well for many uses, i use mostly for the kitchen, appears to be very accurate and you can't beat the price."
5,Great Kitchen Scale!,Perfect size for a kitchen countertop and I love the ease of switching from ounce to pound increments and the tare feature. Very accurate! Vendor provides excellent customer service.
5,Excellent product! So far so good!,"Nice scale! Compact enough, light-weight enough, accurate! Weighed a couple of boxes then checked the weight at the post office and it was right on! Easy to use and easy to read. I recommend it highly!!!!"
1,You Get What You Pay For - Pick a different Scale,"I bought this scale about 3 years ago and had great success for the 1st year. After that, every time I turn on the scale it stays on the Hello screen and never displays the weight. I have managed to get the weight display to come on by taking out the batteries and putting them back in or trying new ones. This is a big pain and I do not recommend this product to anyone. If you already have it, Good Luck!"
1,Don't Buy,"Scale didn't work when received. Requires purchase of very expensive weights to recalibrate. Also didn't include electric cord - have to buy that separate, too."
3,Black is not Silver,"Ordered a ""silver"" model from ""rarehonest1"", received one that's either very very dark silver or just plain old black (yeah, it's black). But it works and is accurate. Also purchased the AC adapter option, which works. Items were both shipped from Tuscon AZ very promptly. Except for the color, I'm happy with it.I'd give it 5 stars if it was the right damn color."
5,The Price of Privilege,"Excellent reference for many of today's kids. Author gave real life accounts of how doing too much for our chldren robs them of necessary life experiences to aid in their social, intellectual and moral development along with alternative suggestions on how to let them experience growth in the safe environment of home. I really enjoyed this book and feel that I learned a lot from it. I've already put some of my newfound knowledge to use with my 11 year old twins."
4,Lots of interesting information,"The book was filled with interesting insight into how affluent kids are being raised. I appreciated the referenced facts and statistics, and the breakdown of what kids are going through by age. It definitely caused me to re-think the reward-based motivation that I have been using with my children, and re-focusing more on the joy of the activity for it's own sake. I also thought the last chapter for mom's was thought provoking - mom's usually don't have the time to think about ourselves. The book definitely lags in places, and there are a lot of chapters that are obvious and/or redundant."
5,The Price of Privilege,"This book enlightens parents to the consequences of pampering their chidren monetarily and with lack of discipline. The topic crosses the affluence boundary and affects all families in this day and age, to some extent. Chidlren are growing up with less of a spiritual core which parents fill with 'stuff', playing into the consumer culture of today. It's not only a great parenting book, but an excellent profile of our need to succeed in order to feel worthy. She is a great writer and I highly recommend this book."
3,"good premise, but redundant material","I am neither an educator nor in the mental health field, I'm simply a parent who tries to read widely. I think the premise of this book is quite interesting, it's certainly an easy read, and the book does articulate a set of problems that privileged kids are faced with. But as is typical with social psychology books, it's overburdened by too many anecdotal stories that describe similar problems without explaining the underlying issues. The parents are universally painted as self-centered and too busy yet expecting the best for and of their progeny; is this really the cause, or are there other downsides of privilege tied to larger social phenomena?This should have stayed a magazine-length article but has been padded to be book-length, with the price tag adjusted accordingly. Borrow it from a friend."
3,Clearly I'm in the minority here..,"This is a very good book with many valuable insights and clinical observations. The problem I have with this book is the same problem I have with the psychological and psychiatric communities in general. Psychotherapists like Dr. Levine have effectively removed religion from their professional discourse and thus their diagnoses, both personal and scoial, are inevitably incomplete. In my opinion, there is a clear link between affluence and secularism/atheism and between secularism/atheism and depression. Statistically, impoverished, less affluent peoples are far more likely to attend religious services on a weekly basis and to hold the religious life in higher esteem. Perhaps it is this lack of a religious orientation that causes or helps to cause those issues which Dr. Levine does consider at length; depression, materialism, perfectionism, stress etc. Unfortuantely, in today's psychiatric climate the question of religion is off the table."
3,For the more intellectually-minded parent,"An important book for affluent parents, with some outstanding content. I think the text is sometimes a bit challenging to read, and would only recommend this book to parents who are comfortable tackling a more complex writing style. But for readers who can navigate that approach, the content should be highly rewarding. I've heard this author's lectures and would recommend her in-person talks especially."
3,"A long book, but has some good info.","The book is worthwhile and has some excellent concepts in it. My only complaint is that most of the important concepts could be explained in a fraction of the pages used, and the book gets long. I'm glad I read it and I learned some things that will help in parenting, but it felt like work to finish the book."
2,"Repetitive and not very ""meaty""","The author of this book spends a great deal of time repeating herself. The result is that you start getting bored and going ""yeah, yeah, yeah, you said that,"" as you're reading. Also, it would have been nice if she'd have given some more concrete examples on how not to end up with kids that aren't ""empty."" For example, she said parents should not be ""overinvolved""--so what specifically does overinvolved with a toddler look like? Or what does it look like with a seven-year-old? She gives a few short examples but they are just kind of brushed over. There are other, better books out there that provide self-assessments that are definitely much more helpful for a parent than this one. She spends much more time talking about the problem than solutions."
3,Car Charger Review,"The cord is a bit short for my situation, but other than that the charger is working as expected. The price was great. I have used it to charge my cell phone twice with no problems."
5,Kahuru:The Making Of An African Legend,"A gem! I liked this novel set in late 18th century South Africa very much. The story starts with a super warrior Tladi(Lightning) who is selected by the village elders to be the leader of his regiment, an unprecedented achievement for someone so young, but Tladi has intelligence and greatness way beyond his years and seems destined for greatness and thats when the blow strikes. I could not put this novel down, it flashes brilliantly like lightning and reflects an author of great promise. The story is told in straight forward and effective language, and the introduction of the human leopard known as Kahuru is nothing short of dramatic; something from out of this world that would surely impress some of hollywoods finest producers. I look forward to reading more work by this author."
1,tree boo,died in three days and a bonsai expert am I...I brought it to a gardening store and they said the soil was ALL SOIL!!! No Peat Moss etc. If you plant a plant in all soil it might as well be CEMENT!
3,Not a lot of Instructions...,"I'm a little disappointed with Glassman Roshi here. Its useful if you're considering a new endevour in business, but as far as personal practice it's not. It's more a bio on Glassman ans his successes, tooting of the horn , I feel. The ""instructions"" were vague an dalmost always applied only to business or corporate functioning. If you're not in this world, don't expect too much."
1,Awful Book,"This is simply an awful book. It is not helpful or in any way informative. Someone wrote that this book should be an article not a Book. In my humble opinion it should not have been published. Read anything by Dr. Alexander Elder, Mark Hulbert, William O'Neil, Edwin Lefevre, Nicolas Darvas, Fosbach, Zweig or anybody that can help the average investor. There is more than one way to skin a cat but none are presented here."
1,One for losers,"In 175 pages all Mr Ellis really said was ""buy index funds"". John Mauldin's ""Bulls Eye Investing"" is 100% better, and after reading it you will understand why this book is for losers."
1,Timeless Stratigies from the Land that Time Forgot,"If you are interested in a well written, easy to understand and a book filled with the fruitful ideas for today's market, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! It was written by a fund investment advisor for fund investors. Dry antique investing methods that are totally outdated. If you are planning on taking control of your finances and successfully investing in today's markets, try something different."
3,"Dissapointed...This should be an article, not a book","Actually all the information in this book can summarized into a short paragraph (read this and skip the book):You can never beat the market so invest in index funds. In the long run Taxes and Inflation will erode your investments and only stocks can safeguard you against it, so invest in index funds which have low taxes. Think long term (20+) years. Short term you will lose money so invest in index funds and dont go checking the stock quotes every day, or even every year. And did i mention index funds :)"
3,Pithy but repetitive,"As someone just beginning to read books about finance and investment, I found this book interesting but repetitive. Perhaps it is important to keep drumming in the same messages: (1) the odds of beating the market by timing purchases of individual stocks are very low; (2) the asset allocation of your portfolio has more impact on your ultimate success than which stocks (mutual funds, whatever) you choose. While I did find the arguments compelling, I also heard them the first time and didn't need to see them again on every page. Fortunately, the book is short (certainly price per page quite high), therefore the repetition comes to an end before too long."
5,One of the great minds,"I don't remember if I read this book, but I read his original article by the same title which other great minds like John Bogle refer to as ground-breaking. Mr. Ellis makes a subtle point which many of the reviewers here -- not surprisingly -- have missed. His point in a kind of plain-speak is you can't beat the market, in the sense that you win, and this guy over here wins, and the other guy wins: it is a zero sum game; if this guy over here wins, then there is less for the other guy to win. He makes an elegant point. In an interview, he gives the example of a tug of war with 5000 people on one side and another 5000 on the other side. Each side can not win at once. The other example he likes is tennis: when two tennis hackers are playing, the one who makes the least mistakes wins."
2,Time Changes Facts?,"Index Mutual Funds worked in the high growth era of the 1990's, but have been bad news since. Therefore, the theory that an investor wastes his time by choosing a manager-run mutual fund is no longer valid, and probably never was. The 2000's have allowed truly great stock pickers to emerge and be in the spotlight. They are easier to find now and the phonies of the 1990's are fleeing the scene."
5,"Brief, clear and wise","Learning how to invest successfully is a challenge because there is so much mis-information in the published literature. Once you find the gems, and this book is one of them, you realize that investing is not that difficult. Other gems include ""Random Walk Down Wall Street"" by Malkiel, and Bogle on Mutual Funds by John Bogle."
2,A tad boring....,I got through half the book. It is a small book but I guess I was bored with the fact that it either stated the obvious or it seems other investment books cover this information better...was disappointed in the way it read.
3,well written and sensible book on investing,"The basic idea of winning the loser's game is:* Institutional fund managers are 90% of the market volume, they *are* the market.* institutional fund managers, as a whole, on the long term, underperform the market* the stock market is a loser's game. it's characterized by the behavior of the losers. (ie. all those professional fund managers)* if you can match the market, you're beating 80% of fund managers.* Therefore winning at a loser's game involves using index funds to match the market.The book's forward is written by Vanguard's CEO, and Vanguard is famous for its index funds. Overall, it amounts to well-written sensible advice for investors, although it would be best to take it only on face-value, with due consideration to other theories out there."
3,Winning the Loser's Game,Generally good. Repetitious at times. Good companion book to others. I wouldn't use it as a sole source. I would recommend under these terms.
1,weather & Climate,"I NEVER RECEIVED THE PRODUCT AS PROMISED. THE BOX WAS EMPTY THE FIRST TIME IT ARRIVED. CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND THEY RE-SENT ITEM. AGAIN THE PACKAGE CAME EMPTY. THIS HAPPENED THREE TIMES, FINALLY I GAVE UP AND REQUESTED A CREDIT. WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO RECEIVING THIS ITEM AND PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A 5 STAR RATING, BUT I CAN'T RATE SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT RECEIVED."
3,Essential reading for the history of the RN in the 1980s,"Barker's account of the naval side of the Falkland's War is fascinating reading, but more so is the telling of the backstairs campaign to save HMS Endurance.Barker, captain of Endurance in the build-up to and during the Falklands War, tells how military cutbacks led to the proposal that the ship be withdrawn from the South Atlantic and how that decision contributed to the Argintine invasion.Barker's campaign to save his ship brought the severe displeasure of Whitehall onto his head; displeasure in no way decreased when he was eventually proved right. He pulls no puches in laying out the mistakes made during the war and in his criticism of the war that Endurance and her drew were treated during and after it."
2,Not one of my favorite needlework books,"I was not impressed by this book. It didn't have very many charts to choose from. If you like floral patterns, you might like this book, though. There is a chapter devoted to how to graph flowers and leaves to make your own charts for needlepoint. The floral and leaf pictures/patterns are quite realistic-looking compared to many modern floral patterns that I've seen. But I was rather dissappointed. I would never spend more than 5 bucks on such a book. There were some pictures of finished needlework but no charts to go with them. There was a picture of 50 thumbnail pictures of all the flowers of the U.S. states, but the only chart included in the book was Kansas' sunflowers. So much for Danish stitching. I was looking forward to seeing samples of traditional Danish stitchery and having graphs to go with them, if I wanted to stitch any of them. But I was not inspired by this book at all."
4,Great Product for Tall Ceinling Fans and pipes,"I would have ginven a 5 star only that the WAND,kept loosening up at the connection point. Being a short person and not much strength to really tighten the pole, I was frustrated in having the connection to the long pole come loose. However, it certainly reach my 9 ft ceiling fans and those industrial pipes that are in my apartment. I would recommend this product for high celings and I almost for to say that you can Bend the wand to clean under those books shelfs, couches, tv stands and more. All those dust balls were kept away with my weekly cleaning. The cloth is washable, but I prefer to air dry the cloth, stays soft. Highly recommend this product."
5,Makes cleaning easier,If you have ceiling fans or hard to reach places (like under furniture) this is the tool to get. It works awesome!
2,Won't last long..,"Originally bought this monitor in 2008. It broke two years later, just wouldn't turn on. HP replaced it free of charge. Went to turn on my computer this morning and the replacement monitor is now dead. This one only lasted a year.. Exact same problem. Just dead and won't turn on, no lights, nothing. Called HP and they were zero help. They said the warranty didn't renew when I got the replacement.. only the original warranty.. which is now expired. They couldn't even direct me to an authorized repair center. They basically said sorry.. So guess I have to find someone to fix it on my own.. Just don't feel like dumping a $1500+ monitor in the trash.Since I've owned this monitor I bought two HP laptops for my daughters.. both broke right after the warranty expired.. Also have two dead HP printers. I swear this company doesn't make anything but junk. I seriously doubt I would buy anything from HP again."
2,large screen but defects,"I purchased this from amazon. one day shipping. Resolution is amazing but at certain brightness levels i see noise in the white areas on the desktop. For example, the white backround of word showed noise like a grey glimmering particles at certain brightness levels. If I am spending over a grand on a monitor, it should not do this... I ended up with a 27 inch Acer B273HU monitor from tiger direct, as amazon does not sell this yet, it works great."
1,WARNING: this monitor will not work with DisplayPort.,"As several others have pointed out, you need a dual-link DVI port to drive this monitor and then only in its native 2560x1600 mode. It will not work with DisplayPort-to-DVI adaptors because they only support single-link DVI. If you use one of these adaptors, the monitor will display at 1280x800."
3,USB Deal Breaker,"Three DVI inputs is great, but there is only ONE USB input. Without USB input switching ability HP should have just left off the USB entirely.Inclusion of USB hub input switching feature wouldn't be earth shattering. The Mitsubishi 2020u from 1998 had two upstream USB ports and could automatically flip the USB input when the video input was changed."
3,Color too Saturated,"Overall a good monitor but even after using my monitor profiling system the colors are excessively saturated. The Samsung 305T 30 inch monitor has much better color.If you are doing color critical work I would be concerned. However, if you are doing general work, surfing, or gaming this is a great product."
3,Works but not like original,"I bought this dust mop head to replace the original. Although it works, it is about half as thick as the one that came with the dust mop. I returned a replacement dust mop head purchased at Lowe's because it was so skimpy. It was similar to this one so I'm not sure you can purchase a quality replacement."
5,Cool gift for grand child,Teddy knows your name is a great interactive gift for our granddaughter. We know she'll get a kick out of it when she hears the bear say her name.
5,Enligntening,Where would the church you attend be if persecution came knocking at the door? What if the government declared your churches doctrines unpatriotic and politically incorrect? How could a Nazi kill Jews all week and go to church on Sunday with a clear conscience? These are the deeply probing questions Erwin Lutzer tackles in this book. When one must choose between church and state where would YOU be at the side of Christ or on the side of the government? This book is enlightening to say the least!
5,"If you are a Christian, you need to read this book.","This book was written in 1995. It is amazing how much of it has already come about. It has been said that if we don't learn from mistakes of the past we are condemned to repeat them. If you are a Christian, you really need to read this book."
3,Very informative but hard to follow,"I usually stay away from any books that talk about Hitler, but this was recommended by a friend who had read it for a discussion group. As I read the book, I realized how little I actually knew about Hitler and Germany prior to and during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Reichs. It was very informative, but I had a hard time following the format. Time sequences seemed to bounce around a bit and it was just frustrating enough that I didn't finish reading the book."
4,Eye Opener for the Lord's People,I thoroughly enjoyed pastor Lutzer's book. He did a masterful job at making a sometimes dry subject (history) interesting. Be advised that this is a book written by a Christian pastor to Christian people but the history and spiritual truth in this book would be a worthwhile read for any who look at the world around us and see a situation ripe for another Adolph Hitler. There is always hope when the one true living God is in control. I encourage you to read this book if that statement intrigues you at all - pastor Lutzer addresses it well.
2,Historical interpretations by a calvinist,"This book does a reasonably good job of showing how Hitler hijacked the church for his own purposes and the complicity of many in the church. Not that this was a total novelty in the history of organized religion mind you.Lutzer really goes off the proverbial deep end when he attributes all of the horrors of that time period to God's will and as a means of ""purifying"" the church. Tens of millions of people (mostly innocents) die because this ""God"" of Lutzer wants to get the church back on the ""straight and narrow""? My what a wicked God this God of Lutzer is.Furthermore Lutzer's attemps to find parallells between Nazi Germany and present day America is fundamentalist fear mongering par excellence.I will help this book be recycled into a new and more useful paper article."
4,Hitler's Cross,"The book was very well written, easy to follow, and historically accurate. I found especially interesting the parallels drawn between society in Germany in 1933-39 and society as it exists in the United States today.Dr. Lutzer does an outstanding job of basing his comments regarding what happened in Germany on both on Scripture and historical fact.While not intended to be an historical text book, I do feel the author could have gone into a little more detail giving specific examples of how the Nazi Party used the church to promote its own agenda.All-in-all it was a very enjoyable book and is highly recommended."
5,Hitlers Cross,"Loved it. Insightful revelations into incremental Nazi schemes which ultimately destroyed Germany and brought disgrace on the Church. A small number of unknown citizens and pastors withstood Hitlers encroachment into religion, and were belatedly exposed for their genuine heroism and martyrdom. This book forces the reader to examine the inner self, and his cultural world, in hopes of recognizing and avoiding similar violations of moral compromise."
4,A solid primer for help in overcoming racism wherever you live,"I am involved in a coalition to overcome institutional racism and I found this book very helpful. It had solid background information/history and a sensitive analysis of the problems confronting all people in the U.S. in the struggle to overcome racism. It gave an excellent basis for doing the work to overcome racism and included enough detail and examples to be both helpful and inspiring. Any white person interested in realizing what is really going on for people of color would benefit from reading it, as well as all people working to overcome institutional racism and struggling with how to proceed will appreciate it."
4,Eclectic and original all around,"Overall, this is a pretty good CD to add to your collection, as it's pretty original. Most of the songs are interesting, sort of ""moody"" background music. Some of them have a bit of a funky tempo, sometimes with a bit of rap added, which I think takes away from the songs. Some of the rap seems a bit disingenuous, and comes off like they're trying to be funky, but somehow they don't quite don't succeed on these particular tracks, because of the rap. An ""instrumental"" version of this CD would be alot better IMHO. But it's still pretty good."
3,First Listen,"Okay, this is my first listen of the album... so my opinion can be different in few days... But now... I like and don't like... Too much beat for me lol! And I don't really like when MC sing... anyway, I will give up more listen... now I give 3/5"
4,Typical Feynman,Interesting to follow the feelings of a man in his objective approach to existance. So many socio-political problems seem trivial when viewed from a detached objective point. Should be required reading for all government employees.
4,More Feynman Gems,"While this book isn't quite on the same level as its predecessor, Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman, fans of the first Feynman autobiography will still find plenty to enjoy. With a considerable chunk devoted to the investigation into the space shuttle Challenger tragedy, there is a little less lighthearted fare here. But there is certainly no less intrigue.Bottom line: read ""Surely You're Joking"" first. If you find that irresistible, this book should be next on your list."
1,Still Not My Cup of Tea,This book portrays the humane aspects of Feynman. It is good for Feynman-fans and historians who want to know Feynman.
2,Hero worship can blind you to reality,"Yes, Feynman was brilliant. Yes, Feynman revolutionized the teaching of physics. Yes, he seems to have been a delightful, charming, handsome, womanizing, fun guy to hang out with. But the Feynman cottage industry ran dry a long time ago. I expect his grocery lists to be published any day now to feed the insatiable hunger for anything that he touched. The essays and articles in this book are bland and nearly worthless. One is introduced as ""uproarious."" Uproarious is defined as ""provoking hilarity."" If you think anecdotes about Feynman running up a stairway to bring his heart rate up are hilarious, you are easily amused. This book was a complete waste of time and money."
3,"Interesting book, but perhaps self-contradictory...","What do you care about what other people think? Well, after reading this book (and Surely You're Joking ...), I came to the suspicion that Feynman cared a hell lot about what other people thought of him. I found this book entertaining, but I believe one of the main goals really was to convince the readers how much smarter he was than the rest of us. I understand that it's in fashion for physicists and grad students of physics to rave about anything Feynman. But then, physicists aren't unlike teenage girls who worship rock stars. There are groupies. There are physicists. And then there are groupie physicists.It'd have been nice if there were a book called ""Surely You Are Joking, Mr. Schwinger"", and the like."
4,What do you care what other people think? Further adventures of a curious character,"Richard Feynman must have been a very interesting fellow! Too bad we all didn't get a chance to have a conversation with him in person. However, reading his books is the next best thing...he writes like he's in your living room."
4,Not as entertaining as SYJ,"This book starts off pretty interesting, but gets bogged down in criticism of NASA management. While I agree with Mr. Feynman on this, I kind of got tired of it after a while. Still, this is a worthwhile read, and if you're a Feynman fan I'd say get it. If you've never read Feynman before I'd strongly suggest Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman!"
3,Not as good as the other one,"I bought this book right away after reading Surely you are joking... and find it not as good mainly because the second half is somewat boring description of investigation of NASA shuttle crash. On the other hand if that is what you are interested in, go for it, because he describes it in great detail. Other than that book contain sad story about the death of his wife, speach about science and couple of stories which would fit nicely in Surely you are joking."
4,No diminishing marginal returns here !,"I just can't get enough of this guy !Still in the spirit of the first book 'Surely you're joking', but a slightly more serious follow up with some repetitions. Here the reader sees Feynmann dealing with the love of his life- his first wife Arline, the Nobel prize and much later the investigation into the Challenger tragedy. This time the hero is better developed and we get to see a more human side of Mr Feynmann in addition to the curious character. Given that he is no longer with us, this book will be treasured as much as the first. Readers unfamilar with the first book will still be able to enjoy the adventures of this remarkable scientist."
4,A Wonderful Treatise,"I have always liked reading about Dr.Feynman! Infact it all started with Surely..Mr.Feynman. This book goes out to show that any guy, can split his time between love and work(which is most often missing from these high profile Scientists/Physicist).His desire to know the root cause of Challenger mishap, and how he goes on to demonstate what transpired the failure of Challenger mishap is very inspiring.All in All a good buy if you are an ardent fan of him!"
4,Good perfomance from blaze,This album is as musically brilliant as all the others before it. The only criticism is that there is no real 'theme ' as previously and as a result the lyrics are not as good as in earlier albums
2,Don't choose BalegoOnline for this item,"The item itself is fine. The problem is when you purchase from BalegoOnline, they charge a 30% restocking fee if the item needs to be returned, as was the case for my purchase. After opening the package and finding out that I needed to return it immediately, I sent an email to which it took several days to get a response. I also phoned the company twice and left a message and finally got a reply on how to send the item back.After they received the item, they only issued a ""partial refund"" and I was told it was because of the restocking fee. Normally it is 30% but they only charged me 15%, like this is doing me a favor. I would understand if the item had been worn or something, but I contacted them basically immediately after I received the item to return it.Bottom line: don't purchase from this company if there is even a SLIGHT chance you'll need to return your order."
4,Good Enough,"It does what it's supposed to do. I am unsure of how long it will last, though it is very cheap and IMO is worth trying if you've never used a back support before."
1,Waste of Money,This product is nothing more than a piece of cloth with some velcro on the end. The whole wrap only stretches about 3 inches and offers absolutely no support what so ever. I would strongly suggest NOT buying this if you are looking for back support
5,Who decides who we are?,"This book is a gift. For people with a sense of humor, it catches us at our most vulnerable. For people with a sense of history, it gives us perspective about the contemporary venture of faith traditions. For people who like accessible poetry that challenges their imagination, there's nothing mushy here or esoteric. The poems are about dirt, blood, food, the mysteries of love, the confusion of faith, the will of companionship, and the probe of identity: are we who we think we are or are we something more?"
5,Cow fan,The hat needed a little molding and adjusting but what fun to wear for Halloween or for a fun night of country line dancing!
2,Great-- until it starts to rip,"Like all decent quality silk bedding, these pillowcases feel very nice and are wonderful to sleep on. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, these are relatively quite lightweight when compared to other silk bedding. Most suppliers list the momme weight of the material (denoted as M/M)-- the higher it is, the thicker, more durable and luxurious the silk. Empress doesn't list the momme weight used, which leads me to believe it is not very high. After less than a year of use, these pillowcases are tearing down the seams. (It's important to note that I currently have 3 sets of bedding that I rotate between, so they each only get washed about once a month.) The sheets I've bought from Empress are also starting to rip, but not the sheets I've purchased from other suppliers. Think ahead, but higher quality sheets and pillowcases."
1,Unhappy,"The quality of this pillow case was terible and did not do as stated for keeping the hair ready for the next day. If I could return it I would, but what is the point since I would have to pay both shipping charges coming and returning.[[ASIN:B00024NW3Q Silk Charmeuse Pillowcase - Ivory - Queen]Can you help?"
2,Not what I expected...,"I ordered this pillow case a few months ago. I found the seller's ad very misleading, as it looked as though I was going to get two pillow cases for the price listed. When it arrived there was only one. ( It only mentions in the "" fine"" print / details that only one is included ). It is very expensive for one pillow case , and I have seen many of similar quality for much less, not to mention it is made in China, and very thin. I followed the care instructions EXACTLY and now it is falling apart, literally. All the seams have come apart and there are holes in it. In my opinion, this is a very poor quality item for the money. Although it was comfortable to sleep on, I noticed no difference in my hair or skin."
4,Soft as - well - silk!,"Pretty and seductive. They are thinner than some, but they seem well put together. I'm getting another pair."
2,No Bed Head?,"Not true. The case is silk, but very thin. I don't know about the claims of fewer wrinkles and no bed head...still get bed head. Go figure."
5,The best!,This is my second time of using this company's excellent silks. The first set lasted for years. I can't imagine putting my hair or skin on anything else.
1,Don't waste your time on this.,"Read ""Ambush Alley"" by Tim Pritchard instead. A book that is chosen by the U.S. Marine Corps heritage foundation for the General Green Award is probably not a very objective book."
4,"A little ""truth""","I served with Suicide Charley, 1/7, and knew many of the people in this book. I just want to say that ""Answitz"", as he's referred to in this book, was full of B/S. He was never in Spetz Natz. We think his Russian accent was a lie too. He was a compulsive liar, and we realized this has he gradually topped each lie he told with an even more out rageous lie. But this is no discredit to the writers of the book. We believed him at first too."
5,An outstanding account by men who were there,"As the commander of a U.S. Army Psychological Operations company assigned to the 1st Marine Division during and after the Iraq War, I can attest to the truth written by Mr. West and MajGen Smith. Their no-holds-barred account of what our Marines, soldiers, and sailors experienced in Iraq is a must-read for anyone interested in understanding how the Iraqis really reacted to their liberation. They accurately depict the extreme sacrifices made by our young men and women, and remind us that all Americans and Iraqis owe a great debt to those who died to make them free."
3,More of a struggle to read than the taking of Baghdad was.,"Though the authors clearly had excellent connections, the telling of the story is rather sophomorish. The book lacks gripping suspense, interesting stories, and drama. It's a shame, too, because the U.S. Marines are a great outfit, and they deserve to have their story told professionally, with candor and color. I found this book hard to finish, though I desperately wanted to finish it--to get it out of my reading pile! There is a false leadup with Corporal Ferkovich that never seems to see the light of day. The book begins as if he is going to figure prominently in it, but in the end he's just another name to fill up pages with.Do I recommend, The March Up? Not at this point. This is the second combat narrative I've read on the Iraq War, and neither one has been sterling. The other was In the Company of Soldiers by Rick Atkinson. Both books lack a real connection with the actual soldiers and both concentrate too much on officers."
2,What an awful album,"Even as a die hard John Prine fan, I've been disappointed with his efforts over the last 10 years. When Souvenirs came out, I thought it was redundant. Anybody can re-record their own stuff. I was afraid I'd think it a pale comparison of the original recordings. Boy was I right! I bought this album finally, to finish off my collection and what a stinker it is. Most of the selections have already been revisited on Live on Tour - where they were excellent. Even though it can be fun and interesting to hear the artist play the same song a little differently, Souvenirs doesn't do it for me."
4,Wall Niche,"the product is of good quality. Not much variety of sizes so mine is little oversized, but acceptable in our Master bath.Bernie"
3,Adventures of a boy and his horse alone in the Adirondacks,This book is a a real page turner. I first read it as child and recently reread it to my own son. He loved it! The story is about a boy coming of age and seeking adventure in the wilderness with his horse.
3,False advertising in the online synopsis.,"I was very excited to see this book listed. For a day and a half I was struggling trying to create a Frame 5.5 template that would satisfy print and html viewing using Frame 5.5's conversion feature. The book stated that it had an entire section devoted to this process. Alas, the book covered a pre-release version of the utility and provided no more information than the sparse Adobe documentation and online help.The title didn't give the reader a true understanding of the document. I thought they would go into some detail regarding the process. Instead they provided a 1,000 ft view point of four utilities.I hope I can return the book. The book spent a lot of space on HTML reference and web design. Hopefully, someday specialty writers will realize that a lot of comprehensive, easy-to-use HTML reference documents already exist and spend there space focused on their speciallty."
2,"Good, but a bit disappointing","Lego Ferris Wheel is not a bad toy for the price ($70) considering how much some items can be. My 8 year old and I had a couple of fun days putting it together (we haven't attempted to make the bridge or crane). Looks really neat and really visually appealing. Our problems 1) there was only ONE rubber band that came with the kit (!) and even that wasn't strong enough or provided enough tension to make the thing work. Without the proper rubber band, the motor runs, but nothing happens. We substitued our own rubber band 2) the cars bottoms fall off - it's fairly flimsy 3) when it's actually running, it's tricky to keep the wheels from scrapping against the sides of the frame, and when that happens, the wheel won't turn 4) mini figs can't fit in it -- Lego give you little tiny ""pretend"" people. Sort of disappointing.Overall we give it a 2 (or 2 1/2)."
4,Fun to build,"My 7 year old had great fun over three days building this project. - and after playing with it for a week, he put it away (it was taking up space).A month later he built his own imaginary structures - but finally followed up by building the moving bridge - he liked that, but unfortunately the motor had stopped working by then, so he was left with manually moving it.Lego blocks are good because you can always re-use the pieces, but this one the pieces are a bit specialized and don't lend themselves to building other more solid projects."
5,A fantastic Book for a fantastic exploration,"I belive that this book let's you travel in the past, in a world where go to the north pole was like go to the moon today. Amundsen was a no fear man, he went where no one went before him and his expedition were the unfortunate victims of bad luck and bad weather. This is the history of that man, and this book let's you live tha experience"
3,Horrible,"Nothing like Monster party, At all. You will need the Walkthrough online just to figure out where you are. Game is Too hard, Too difficult, and first time your killed your back where you started. Its really just a joke."
2,"Wife think they suck, as does the husband!","I know these blades are meant for women. My wife was complaining about them and gave to me saying she was sick of how they didn't work. I was out of blades for myself so I thought I'd try them for my face. Man, they are horrible! I would recommend SCHICK TITANIUM blades. These are meant for hairless people."
4,Decent Introduction to Metropolis Records Artists,"This is a compilation of songs from 13 different Metropolis Records artists from the year 2000. Fans of Metropolis Records can expect to hear some tracks ranging from EBM, electro-industrial, and Futurepop. I enjoyed all of the songs on this comp to varying degrees but my three favorite tracks are:Rheas Obsession ""Between Earth and Sky (Maximum Tabla Mix)""Front Line Assembly ""Retribution""VNV Nation ""Rubicon""There is also a previously unreleased track by Funker Vogt on the compilation that I am sure their fans will want to complete their collection. Its titled ""Horizon"" and is one of the stronger tracks on the album."
4,A good intro to EBM and Industrial,"Not a lot to say about individual tracks because, save one, they have been heard before. Yet that is part of what makes this album a good choice to the fan, casual listener, or curious. The selection of tracks is suitably mild and danceable. Even the Wumpscut selection is one of the more mellow songs they do. As an addition to a collection, this grouping makes for good listening or dancing. For the un-initiated, think of NIN, but not as guitar heavy. Stand out tracks - Wumpscut - ""Hang Him Higher"", DIN_FIV - ""Through the Looking Glass"", VNV Nation -""Rubicon"", and Apoptygma Berzerk ""Soultaker""."
5,Cutest Toy Ever,"This is the cutest little toy ever! He is absolutely adorable and I play with him every day. I have had him for a little over a year now; he has been through the washer and the dryer already, however he is holding up fine. I would definately recommend this toy to anyone."
4,Works but instructions inaccurate,"It says press/squeeze/hold for 30 seconds, thats only valid if both pieces are flat. If they tend to bend you need to hold it much longer, a minute atleast and add a whole lot more of this stuff. Point is it messes up your fingers and the surface you are working on, I needn't say it, but watch out. Otherwise it works grest. Tip--wear cheap gloves and work the stuff over aluminium foil."
4,It works like it says it does,I used this krazy glue to repair a small tear in a leather jacket. It worked fine and I am pleased with the results.
3,Nothing special,"I just had this glue , it's work like a regular glue and the bottle too small it's not enough to use something bigger .....but anyway it's strong glue"
2,"Nice, but way too big!","I bought these in size 0-9 months for my 2-months old daughter, but they are way too big! They are so long that they probably won't fit until she is at least 18 months. Too bad because they are nice cotton tights."
3,"Nice quality, but sizing is off","These tights are cute, soft, and thick, but they are much larger than I expected. My daughter is an 18-month size in everything (Carter's, Ralph Lauren, Baby Gap, Columbia, Savannah, and Circo), but these are absolutely way too long."
3,interesting combo,"between history and scifi. It taught me a lot about the time period, and had an intruiging plot. Confusing ending. Overall, it's hard to classify this book exactly."
4,Deep & complex,"This book is not for the average reader. It's geared more towards the reader that grasp the concept of time travel. Also the respect of a man's devotion to his life's love. I also recommend that you listen to Living Colour's ""Time's up!"" as you read, it complemments the story."
4,Review of Modern Epidemiology,"The book was in excellent condition as far as having no marks. However, given the way the pages stick together, it appears the book may have been exposed to moisture, either in shipping or before it was shipped. However, given the great price, I give it 4 stars."
5,"Buy ""Epidumbiology Without Numbers for Dummies"" Instead!",This is the wurst ridden epidumbiology book I ever red.Us epidumbiologists don't need to know all this hard stuff. We need more ez 2 read books with short wurds and no equations and no Greak letters. Buks that tell us in simpleton terms we ken under stand some wrong weighs to do our studies and sum wrong wheys to annulize our data and sam wrong waze to interprut our resultz.But most of all we need bigger pictures to color with our crayons. The only gud coloring pictures in this buk are those stoopid Rothman's Pies. But I keep going outside the lines.
2,oy,"didnt care for this book. Good information, but presented poorly. I think there are better textbooks out there now that present information clearer and in less words and without crazy equations."
2,unnecessary details on statistics subject,"I agree with many reviewers here that the book is great, but poorly organized and put too much on statistical methods. I have read through it from cover to cover for my exams. Nevertheless, the first part discussion is very good, but you need to read other books before reading Rothman's book. Acutally, I really hate Greenland's writing, it is too obscure. I would not recommend this book to students."
1,WORST epi book for students!!!,"This text is not suitable for students at all. You will get more use out of this book as a doorjamb. Very disorganized and poorly written. Takes straightforward epidemiologcial concepts and overly comlpicates them. Don't believe the 5 star ratings. They are highly suspect and appear to be written by the authors themselves or their groupies. If you are a student trying to learn epidemiology, avoid this book at all costs."
1,Poorly written with poor thought process,"This is a poorly written book.Definitely it is not for students.It's jumping from one subject to another, then turn toothers all the time. You could easily get lost andfrustrated to follow.Usually this sort of thing happens when the authors do notknow what they are writing."
3,A good reference on shelf,"It is a good refence-type textbook for epidemiology. I first used it in my introductory course of epidemiology at Harvard University's program of Master of Public Health. Even Prof. Rothman came to classroom in person for several lectures. It was a good book but accompanying books were needed for better understanding of the topic. Now I am in my PhD program at National Taiwan University, Taiwan and using the book for the 2nd time. There are still new things to discover from the book. For a reader who uses the textbook twice in graduate studies, I recommend it as a guide or outline for further exploration into the field. Advanced studies require lots of reading, aren't they? It should be on your shelf, for future reference, but not the only one."
3,Not that cool but all right,I got this thing as a gift but the first time I opened it i tried out the spider power flix and the legs got bent and it looks like it is going to break. Don't get this toy if you have little siblings because they can break it easily. That is what happeneds to my thing my little cousins messed up the legs.
4,Excellent,I really appreciated the readability of this book. In a field crowded with overly-technical jargon Michael Kirwan lays out the theology of Rene Girard in a way that anyone can grasp and appreciate. An excellent introduction.
4,Good overview of Girard's thought,"Fr Kirwan's book is a good introduction to Rene Girard. Reading Girard's theory on mimetic contagion and scapegoating and its application to the Old and New Testament is a revelation. Girard sees the revelation of God in the Old and New Testament as not just another myth but rather the process by which God unfolds what has been going on in Human Culture since time began. For Girard, all human cultures are founded on a scapegoat who has been ritually murdered. Myth tells the foundational murder from the perspective of the vitimisers. Girard discovered that, by contrast, the Judeo-Christian scriptures do the opposite: they side with the victim.However, having read Kirwan, it is always best to go back to Girard and let him speak for himself."
4,Perhaps this is their best effort...within a ProgMetal genre,"Perhaps this is their best effort so far...a mature work, whose definition within a ""metal progressive genre"" is becoming narrow after a repetitive listen!! They are influenced from US Bands like Kansas or Mastermind, but also from the classical excerpts by Jethro Tull (listen to ""Counterpoints"")and ELP (listen to ""Confessor's Overture"")..a couple of ""aggressive"" and quite skillful musicians, such Gardner brothers (already famous within our preferred ""progressive genre"")... in particular the track ""Halluncination Suite Part 1 - Uppers and Downers"" is their best instrumental, with good ambient keyboards and a drum solo as well!!At the end I can not recommend this work as an original and particular creative work, but it's a true ""Magellan trademark"", that is a typical US Metal Progressive sound, influenced by such symphonic progressive rock in the vein of ELP...make your personal choice!!"
2,Too predictable,"It's amazing how some bands just don't understand what 'feelings' are all about. Music is a personal expression yes, but it also has to be fun to listen to. There are several metal or neo-metal bands I listen to occasionally, but Magellan is really boring. There is no 'spark' about it, no inspiration behind it. It's more a mish-mash of styles they try to emulate but it comes out gray rather than colorful. It's worth maybe a couple of listens but the bad news is you'll start yawning, then reach for CD's by beaucoups of other bands that are far better. Best advice is to just skip this CD entirely and move on to something you KNOW you will enjoy."
1,NOT a Tribute,"This CD was a true disappointment. If you're a true Van fan, then this hill-billy version will not soothe the soul but will incense one's inner Irish - even if you're not Irish. This is not a tribute but an assault on his style and someone's way to make money on Van's coat tails. This CD is now with all the free AOL CD's I get in the mail . . . now does that sound like a tribute?"
1,Serving Size,"I don't understand how this is 60 servings when one serving is a teaspoon, which is 4.2 grams, and there is only 93.5g. Can someone please explain this to me?"
1,A-B CALM Instant Calcium Magnesium Drink,"Was hoping the A-B Calm freeze dried Instant Drink would be paletable. But it really is not.Also, having to boil it first before drinking is a hassle. Would not buy again."
5,Great manga!!,"This is one of my favorites because of my love for Norse mythology, and the game Valkyrie Profile. It has a lot of action, some humor and really nicely done art work. Ragnarok has some awsome images and material. Very well researched. Highly recomended!!"
3,"Great, insightful, witty....to a point.","Lucky Wander Boy was the novel I'd been waiting for for awhile. When I first heard about it, I was psyched there was a novel coming out about video games. Little did I know that LWB was the TurboGrafx of new literature.The first half of the book is truly commendable. Weiss has a great writing style and an intelligent way of writing life through a gamer's eyes. We want to like Pennyman, and do, until he completely loses grasp on reality and spirals into this selfish, self-pitying stupor. It's even difficult feeling sorry for the guy, because he's so ridiculously hung up with his past. I can be overly nostalgic too- we all can- but there's a line.I don't regret reading it, because there is merit to the story. Thoughtful insight may be taken away. Some of it's actually very funny. It just could have ended a lot sooner."
2,NOT The Great Videogame Novel,"After hearing unending praise for this new piece of ""gaming literature"", I certainly was interested. However, I came away pretty disappointed.Yes, this is a novel based on gaming. And, yes, this aspires to literary heights. But it fails - I don't want to get so excited that gaming is now ""literary"" that I ignore the quality of the work itself. This feels derivative of any number of GenX novels, tracing back to Copeland's ""Generation X"". The characters are shallow, the social commentary bland, and the ending ..... nonexistent.This is an utterly mediocre attempt, and the fact it concerns videogames shouldn't matter at all. The Great Videogame Novel still is waiting out there, somewhere. ""Lucky Wander Boy"" sure isn't it."
3,"I love video games, but...","Okay, so I actually do what the main character in this book does, I catalog obsolete entertainment on a rather large ""coinop"" website with a "".org"" at the end of it. I'm also a fan of Japanese culture, so this book at least probably targets me a little bit, right?So I should probably love it.But.It had some real momentum and some real character development happening, then it suddenly took a left turn. The left turn it took was into an unwritten Kobo Abe novel, some kind of an attempt at a surrealist ending, or rather an attempt at many surreal endings. In my opinion, it just didn't quite work.So, regretfully, I give it 3 stars."
4,Great!!!,"WWII has always fascinated me. I generally prefer war novels like THE NAKED AND THE DEAD or THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY to histories, but the better written nonfiction books are well worth reading. I though Bando's ""The 101st Airborne at Normandy"" was terrific, very informative, especially about the courage and initiative of the paratroops themselves to salvage the situation after the scattered drops of the night. Very good book!"
5,NUFF TALKIN!!!!!!!,"THEM BRITS MUST HAVE THE FORMULA!!!! HOW THIS SONGSTRESS ISN'T GETTING MAJOR SPINS BAFFLES ME. THERE ISN'T ONE WEAK/WACK CUT ON THE CD. JUST PUSH PLAY AND CHILL. HARD TO BELIEVE SOME OF THE BEST MUSIC NOW-A-DAYS ISN'T BEING HEARD. NUFF TALKIN, GO GET THIS NOW!!!"
5,Cute and Convenient!,"These little pans are the best! Instead of making one large pie, I can make four mini-pies that serve one person very well or two people nicely. The nonstick coating works well at keeping stickier pies (like pecan) from getting too stuck-on. I've also made mini chicken pot pies in these and they turned out fantastically!"
5,Good for home made pot pies,I bought these so I could make my own pot pies at home. They are just the right size and I love them.
3,Not what I expected but will do,"I was looking for some of this sized pan for quite some time. Our kids love to have cookie monsters for their birthday treat, and these make perfect individual-sized cookies. However, these particular pans are NOT the color of the picture. They are darker, which I was hoping to avoid since dark pans tend to burn whatever I put in them. I would have loved to have found stainless steel ones, but no luck so I settled on these. If I had known that they were going to be almost black in color, I would have never purchased them. Nevertheless, I can make do - I just have to keep a closer eye on the oven when using them."
1,Not a quality item,"These pans were the size I was looking for but the non-stick coating was flaking off right out of the package. I was also sold an opened item, and there were deep scratches on almost every pan. I was able to find a much better set of glass mini pie pans at bed bath and beyond. These were just a waste of time."
5,Nice Pie Pans,I wanted these so I can make individual pies for my Dad. These will also work great for my husband so he can take them back and forth from work. Nice heavy duty pie pans. Great nonstick finish on them.
3,pot pie pans,This order was sent fast but I wish that the pans were alittle bigger but they are okay.They are the size you get when you buy a standard size frozen pot pie.
2,NOT WORTH IT,"These mini-pie pans are really too small to even bother making a pie. I thought it would be bigger....I suppose I can still use it to make INDIVIDUAL pot pies, but for dessert pies, it should be bigger. Was dissappointed."
1,Disappointed--Not as Pictured,"The pie pans are a very dark metal color; the picture by the seller is not representative. If you are an avid baker or cook, then you know that dark metal absorbs more heat and will cook the dough or contents of the mini pie dish with more intensity, therefore increasing the chances of burning / uneven cooking. Additionally, since the pie pan is small, you have to watch the oven very closely to make sure it doesn't overcook. I guess you could lower your oven temperature by 25 degrees with these, but I'm pretty set on finding a lighter colored mini pie pan because I have seen them around in stores. My next task: Return these and purchase the Wilton mini pie pans as they look like a lighter metal color.Follow-Up:I ordered the Wilton mini pie pans and I am thrilled with them. I made several mini pies that did not burn; the temperature was just right and they were a hit. I recommend Wilton over this product."
2,far smaller than expected,"The pans work well, but are the size of one of those tiny pies sold in the bread aisle. I was looking for something that would serve two, and this barely serves one. More trouble to return than keep, but will give them to my grandkids when they are old enough for mud pies."
5,These mini pie tins are perfect for gifts,"I love these little pie tins. I make mini-shepherd's pie in each and then freeze them. After freezing, I take the pies out of the tins, and give the pies as gifts. They're perfectly sized for personal mini-pies, both sweet and savory. I've used these several times and have never noticed any problems. Also, the price ($10) is just right too."
2,Not so great,We have Huffy liners in our truck and I thought these would look nicer for our SUV. I was very disappointed and wished I would have purchased the Huffy liners.
5,"Forbidden Doors, Great books for ages 10-100!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Hi, I'm Stefanie and I want to tell whoever is reading this, Read The Decieved by Bill Myers. It is a great book about the dangers of hypmotism, satin, and teaches the bible and about Jesus at the same time. Young pre-teens can even read it! I am 11 and Strongly recommend it for almost any age. If you don't believe me, read the other reviews and check out The Decieved and other forbidden doors books by Bill Myers."
5,GREAT book!,"This is a beautiful allegory that is life-changing. It's not a quick read, but something to meditate upon and soak in as you allow God to show you areas of your own heart that need to be healed or transformed. Highly recommend it!"
5,An incredible journey into the NW Native culture.,"I have read and looked at many books about Northwest native art and culture but this book quickly overshadowed all the others I had read. It is a book filled with incredible photographs and a thorough explanation of this ancient culture. This book is history, beauty, a visit to the past, a visit to the future... a visit to now....it is a visit to extraordinary talent, it is a visit to a people whose imagination and reverence for nature and life could be an example to all of us in today's fragile world.This not just another coffee table book..this is a must have for every person who loves art, who loves nature and who loves beauty. It is a walk with Northwest Native artists who talk to us through the words and photographs of Ralph and Karen Norris."
3,.,"This book is like if someone told you they could s--- a rainbow. It sounds great and you're going to stick around to see it but you wont be standing too close because rainbow or not, you don't want to be s--- on."
3,"Structurally sound, but not detail oriented. :(","Like the title says, it is perfectly structurally sound. Aesthetically, it is (mostly) fine too. I prefer the bronze with a little copper color in it. This rack is more brownish black and completely uniform in color. But the thing that really bothers me is the company (Gatco) did not include BRONZE SCREWS. The screws SHOW and they are SILVER. I had to get a brown marker to cover them up. It looks tacky. You'd think for $60 odd dollars, you could spend a cent more per 1000 screws to make it match.But that is my only complaint. Oh well."
2,Minor Scratches and Dents,"My rack from the manufacturer was scratched and dented. Its not obscene, but noticeable. Definitely what could have been a 4 star product now gets 2. I installed it anyway... maybe I can live with it..."
4,Very good value for the money,"Just the right size and really quite good looking. I did not want to spend a ton of money on this and was able to pick one up used in the Amazon Wharehouse. A cover plate for the screws would give it a more finished look. We installed it using Home Depot's 1/8"" x 3"" toggle bolts(2"" toggles were too short) Sturdy as can be!"
5,just perfect,"second time I have installed one of these. Perfect for keeping the towels handy. Came promptly, in excellent condition and is very good quality and easy to install."
5,great product!,i thought it might be a bit heavy or was afraid of over heating but no! it works like a charm! and it looks just like the rest of my titanium laptop!
2,Could be much better,"I bought this book because I was interested in the idea of being able to read at an ""ultra fast"" speed. Even though I have a basic understanding of the information conveyed in the book, it was a difficult read because of the apparent translation issues. The layout of the book was at times confusing and the sentence structure was often awkward. This book was obviously meant to be used to help young people develop the ability to read at a ""quantum level"", but the author did make the attempt to explain how an adult could apply the techniques to him/herself. Still, the attempt did not nmake up for the lack of coherency that occured throughout the book. The idea behind it still intrigues me, but I'll wait till I find a better book that will inspire me more than this one this did before I actually try it out for myself."
2,Disappointed,"Item arrived in a timely fashion, but damaged - chipped and scratched. I thought at first it was poor packaging, but the damage was not where the package was effected. Won't be returning it since the cost was not much more than what it would cost me to return it. Also very disappointed with the weight of it, expected it to be a bit more hefty. I'm old enough to remember what they used to feel like. Positive notes, I like the 3/4 cup capacity and color. Hope it holds up since the damage is exactly at the attachment point where cup meets handle. Should be nice for batches of hearty winter soups."
1,Stinks!,"So thoroughly refuted by scholars like James Valliant, it should be listed among works of fiction. Poorly written fiction, but still fiction. Even the author had to do this over, but it got no better."
2,Too hard for little ones!,"This toy seemed like a great idea, but as another reviewer said - it takes a decent amount of force to get a ball through the mouth. So much so, that I don't anticipate my [...]really using this too much. Definitely a let-down."
2,toy needs improvment,"I bought this for my son for christmas. It is a nice idea and looks very cute but has a lot of problems. Most importantly is the balls don't easily fit in the mount you have to really push them in. This is to hard for my 11 month old son to do. Secondly, it only has one song which is anoying after a while(it also goes wee, and another noise when you get the ball through his mount). Finally, sometimes the balls don't come out of him and you have to tilt the toy to get the m loose. He losses intrest in a few minutes. It does have a sturdy base which allowes for standing which is I think it's onl plus. I would not recomend this toy."
5,Must Read!!!,"First off, I almost purchaced this item for my daughter for Christmas today from Walmart, but decided against it due to the fact that it did not have many different sounds and my daughter is still a bit small for it. So I will not sit here and say whether it is a good or bad product. I just wanted to inform anyone who bothers to read these reviews that Walmart is selling this exact same product for only $15! I mean think about it... Amazon almost $50 and Walmart is $15 currently. Please check your local walmart before you spend this kind of money for it on Amazon. :)"
4,Lot's of fun! Purchasing this Giraffe is no gaffe.,"My son recieved this as a gift on his first Christmas. He's two years old now and he still likes to play with it every once and a while. It's cute, it's colorful. The sounds and jingles are cute. My son loves feeding the giraffe or just pressing the button on it's forehead. He also gets a kick out of watching the balls slide down.While the name says ""Sit to Stand"" I wouldn't buy it for the purposes of having your child lean on it as he learns to stand. But, the good news is that a child can play with it while sitting or standing. If you want you child to learn to stand, just have him rest up against the couch.I think that your child will enjoy this toy just as mine did."
1,Choking hazard,The screws that are supposed to connect the feet keep falling out. A huge choking hazard! The head of the giraffe is very hard and heavy. Another dangerous feature since this toy tips if a child pulls up on it.
1,A Waste of Money and space,This is a boring waste of space. My son got it as a Holiday present and he never plays with it. It seems like it should have come with 4 balls since there is 4 shoots but it only comes with 3. There is very little you can do with this toy and it takes up a fair amount of space. The balls are flimsy and if stepped on they are dented and done. STUPID TOY
2,Dangerous!,"I was really excited to receive this toy for my 9 month old as an early Christmas present from my cousin. She said it would aid my baby to learn how to stand. However, this can be a dangerous toy if you leave the child unattended. My baby boy tried to stand by pulling from the giraffe's ears and he felt on his back and hitting his head. The whole giraffe was on top of him. He was crying like crazy and very scared. I took the toy out of his room for the moment to see if it is more appropriate when he grows older. He doesn't seem to be interested in the toy anyway. Sometimes the balls get stuck in the mouth of the giraffe and it only plays one silly sound."
3,Easy to lose balls,We bought this toy for my daughter. She lost the balls within days and we've had a hard time finding affordably priced replacement pieces.
5,A Winner!,"My Grandson loved this toy. He couldn't stop playing with it, and even to this day, this is one of his favorite toys. He is developing his motor skills by playing with this toy. The colors are fantastic!"
5,Awsome,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. I love to watch her learn how to place the balls in the hole and stand. She loves to sit up and dance to the music.
5,My daugther loves this product,My daughter loves this toy. She loves just making the music play. If anyone needs the replacement balls go to Fisher Price web site because it is so much cheaper.
2,not so great,"The biggest disappointment is that the ball often got caught in the track, we had to install an additional screw to force the track to the right place so the balls would not get stuck. It would be more fun if it played more songs. For what the toy does I feel it is quite bulky."
4,This price is ridiculous,"Don't pay $50 for this- we bought it for $15 at Wal-Mart a few days ago.It's worth probably $25, but there's NO reason to pay $50!!"
2,"Disappointing, & difficult to assemble","First off, this thing was particularly difficult to assemble, even by the standards of children's toys. The guide holes that the screws insert into don't line up properly without some good bending & twisting of the plastic. Since no one else has mentioned this, it may be that there was a manufacturing flaw in the unit we got.As for the toy itself, I agree with others: the balls stick more often than they should, and the toy isn't as stable as it ought to be. Most importantly, our 10-month-old got bored pretty quickly.Also it's curious that there is a ""under 3"" small parts warning on the product description, when the product is designed for 9 months and up.All in all, I'd say give it a pass, there are much better things out there from Fisher-Price and others."
2,not a safe toy,"I bought this for my son for Christmas and although he loves pulling himself up with it, it is very unstable and will tip over with the weight of the baby. Not only that, but the head pops off!!! It is not latched on or connected to the base at all. I also can't stand that it only makes one sound. Save your money and buy the crawl and cruise musical jungle, best investment ever."
3,Perfect for our infant,"I read the previous reviews about how difficult this product was to use but had a friend that had one and their infant loved it. I bought it anyway and had no problems with having our 10 month old use it as well as being able to get the balls in to the giraffe's mouth without any problems. As my son has grown though, there is a tipping issu with the toy. Our son is 20 lbs and if he leans in the right direction it will go over with him so don't expect it to hold up your child."
2,1 mislead mom,"THE DESCRIPTION IS VERY MISLEADING!!!! HOW CAN THIS BE READY TO PLAY IF IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE CO2 CARTRIDGE?? WE LEARNED THIS ON X-MAS MORNING, A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT. THE KIT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT, IF NOT FOR THE MISSING ITEM."
3,Before Buying suggestion,"My name is Zac Cable. I have a friend who bought this kit and said it was very good. But he said when it came in, there was no co2 tank. And when it did come in, it only gets 150 shots. He suggested to me since I am looking to buy it to buy a 20 oz. tank a few days before. Isuggest the same to you."
2,"Not ""Ready-To-Play""","I bought this kit for my son for Christmas. It was advertised at the time as ""Ready To Play"". Well, it wasn't.The CO2 cartridge was missing. Instead, there was a postcard from the manufacturer stating you had to send the card to them and then they would ship the cartridge.There was a cutout in the foam for a cartridge, so it looks like they've shipped them previously with the cartridge. Perhaps they ran out.Needless to say, my son was sorely dissapointed he couldn't play immediately.The kit is fine otherwise. The marker and accessories are sufficient for the price paid."
3,Missing a CO2 Cartridge,"This was supposed to be a ready to go package by the box and the pictures even show it. But when I got it there was no CO2 cartridge. Then I called to get the cartridge sent to me and then they wanted me to send the whole thing back to them. It was ridiculous!!!! Plus i intended to use it in the next few days. Total BS!!! Other than that evertything else was excellent, plan to get a 20 oz canister anyways."
1,NO there are better deals,"Dont buy this, there are way better guns for better prices like the Piranha R6 Player pack that is way better and it's cheaper!!My freind has the vexor and I have the piranha he agrees the piranha is way better!! so get something else.The Piranha I mentioned is on amazon."
3,Can't use it without the tank,"Shipping was fast, however when we opened it, instead of an air tank it had a postcard we could send to receive one who knows when. It was suppose to be field ready when we received it but now I'll have to go out and buy a tank at Walmart to use it. If I had known that it did not come with a tank, I would have added one to the order and saved on the shipping costs!!!"
3,MInes ( Co2) not in their either !!!,"I noticed a previous review after we received our order for Xmas. We were also fairly happy with the product, but it was very disapionting, that the Co2 cartridge was not included with the original package. Why even have the ""foam cuttout"", which is where the item is packed if your not going to ship the darn thing. We feel somewhat slighted by the product information and will not be ordering any supplies from this site in the future......can anything be done to restore our confidence?"
3,"Nice item, but no CO2","The description is very misleading. It states it is field ready and has everything you need-but it doesn't! You can not use this gun without the CO2, which doesn't come in the package-so how can it say it has everything it needs and be ready to use??? The description should much clearer. The kit is very nice and I still would have ordered it-but I also would have ordered the CO2 had I known when I placed my order."
2,No CO2 tank,"I thought the package lists everthing I need but when we opened the box and found there's no CO2 tank. If I knew earlier, I will buy CO2 tank and now I have to buy as a separate item. The ad is misleading consumers."
3,Christmas Gift,"I received the item quickly, however was disappointed when the CO2 tank was not included."
1,Very poor technical knoledge,"The content of the book is quite poor, the technical terms used are rather ""peculiar"", like for example ""semi-anechoic far field"" or ""noise path"" referring to transfer path analysis (TPA) problems."
4,Great Carrier - Great Price,"I love this carrier. I use it almost every day. It's super simple to put on and take off and my daughter loves it. This carrier was the most comfortable one I tried on in the store and it also fits my husband perfectly.My daughter loves to be held close all the time, but that makes it hard to get errands and housework done. This carrier is the perfect solution. The carrier padding is very soft and machine washable (a wonderful feature as my daughter tends to spit up a lot).My only complaint is that the straps do tend to slip so I have to readjust them a lot. This is not a big hassle though, the straps tighten easily and I've gotten so used to doing this that I don't even think about it anymore.Overall, this carrier was a wise investment. We have especially enjoyed using it at baseball games and in movie theaters."
2,I don't feel confident with it,"I have a 2 month old and I just do not feel comfortable using this carrier. I bought it because it was cheaper than baby bjorn and I thought that it would be the same, but I just do not feel that it is that sturdy. My baby is 14 pounds now and I just cannot use it, he does not like it, and I feel like it is going to rip or I will hurt my back using it."
3,Good for my stroller that does not have a parent tray...,I do wish the bottle holder was a little bigger to fit a sippy cup. Graco quality/sturdy.
1,Don't buy this one,This book was a waste of time and money. There was very little specific information on the breed except on probably 3-5 pages. Almost everything else should just say canine.
2,Good Basic Beginners Book,"As a first time dog/Amstaff owner, I found this book very helpful for the first couple of months of ownership, but would highly recommend following it up with The American Staffordshire Terrier by Jacqueline Fraser ASAP."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,"If you never owned a dog before, I might recommend this book, but now that I think about it, NO I wouldn't..The pictures are even bad..Don't buy it!"
5,Restores my Faith in Quality Fiction,"The Yellow Rose is the first novel I've read in quite some, but I'm delighted to say that it was well worth the wait! Gilbert Morris has done an excellent job weaving an exciting tale of action, adventure and romance. He's created a wonderful balance between historical fiction and romance, a nice blend of narrative and just enough facts to set the tone of the story.Hosting a radio show for Christian living doesn't allow me much opportunity for reading novels, but I'll be sure to make the time to read more of the Lone Star Legacy series. I'm looking forward to reading book 3!"
4,Good reference book for writers.,"There is a lot of good information in this book for anyone writing in the paranormal genre. Actually, a lot more information than I needed! It's not easy to find this much folklore and legend in one book, so I'm glad I found it."
4,A wonderful book for beginner's...,"I do believe there are some aspects of this book that seem a bit farfetched, and there are topics that I feel the author makes up a reason just to bring them up and relate them to faeries, such as Harry Potter, stargate SG1 (wormholes) and a few others. However I have often been asked by people, since I've been studying faeries and celtic and irish mythology and folklore for many years, where to begin learning about faeries? I always recommend this book. It outlines all the basics of the folklore and how stories originated, as well as the history of faeries. It gives an excellent overall picture of faeries and elves so that any novice could comprehend it easily. Towards the end there are guides for meditation and inviting the fae into your life, and I feel the author gives a simplistic outline of instructions for those who believe in the faerie realm to follow. And for those who don't believe, the book is still an excellent source of information for any beginner."
1,I can't seem to read this book,I kept opening this book and reading a few pages at a time but never found myself wanting to read further. I kept thinking surely I'll get more interested if I read just a bit further. For now I've quit reading it and am not even done with the first book in this set.The story sounds and starts off like something I think I would enjoy. A man gets transported to another world where Witches exist and has to adjust and find his way. Sadly though the premise is more exciting to me than the actual work.Perhaps if I'd just read a few more pages..
3,3BYRDSLANDINLONDONTOWNE,good sounding recording. as big of a fan of rogers that i am my reason for buying this set was for the gene clark tracks. gene's solo from 77 was his first since 74's masterpiece no other. gene never got his due. the mcguinn/clark/hillman record came out after this. that disc had some nice tracks but was way to cold. anyways grab this its so nice to have it on cd now.
4,Southern Manners review,"Listening to Southern Manners, you might not guess that it's the Watson Twins' debut album. It's very polished, easy on the ears, and the music stays with you. I'd recommend this even to people who don't normally listen to country / folk music.Get this one before Fire Songs. It may be because it (Southern Manners) has only acoustic songs but it feels more personal and sincere than Fire Songs, where it's songs sound like they sing just to sing. In other words there is not as much of a connection.P.S. Nothing against Fire Songs. I have it and I think it is good but not as much as it's predecessor."
4,Pepto-Bismol has always helped with my heartburn. I ...,Pepto-Bismol has always helped with my heartburn. I really didn't find any difference between the regular and extra strength but would highly recommend it.
3,Not for the gardener,"This book is magnificent - as a reference work for a rosarian. Unfortunately, it fails to give the clues a gardener might wish for in terms of how a rose will adapt to climates, etc."
2,Lost in time,"My main problem with this book was that the main character didn't seem to fit into her setting at all. I simply couldn't imagine her as the first century Jewish woman she was supposed to be. I know that Mary Magdalene was a social outcast, but I have a hard time believing that she acted like a 20th century woman lost in time. Nonetheless, Miriam was a believable character, if a bit misplaced, and so I read the book through to the end.If you're looking for believable historical fiction, look elsewhere (I recommend ""The Bronze Bow"" by Elizabeth George Speare). But if you're interested in a the story of a girl tormented by her inner fears and struggling against society, you'll find the right book in ""Song of the Magdalene."""
2,Sad,"This movie had so much potential, it really did make me sad. Unfortunately the audio was off, the filming was off, and the narrative was off. Ultimatly I was left confused and a little irritated. A movie really shouldn't make a person irritated. The confusion stemmed from poor script writing and an outright disbelief in the character's actions. They completly ignored human nature and our tendancy to ignore/destroy boundries. And what community isn't complete without its conspiracy theorists? The wall would never have stood unquestioned for so long. I must also question brothers killing each other for getting in the way. Why not help each other out? Its not as though this society has done anything for them. It was all too much for me, though I wish it had played out better. All I could think throughout the movie is what a great book it could have been. And ultimatly, loads of potential does not make for a good movie."
1,"Bad... Super-bad... Aw, fugetaboutit...","They really tried very hard to make a bad movie. They did everything right: bad actors, bad script, bad dialogue, bad lighting, poor sound, worst cinematopgraphy, confusing action, booring stuff. They could have succeeded if they had skipped the knife fight at the end, but that fight was good. Wait a minute. It was unrealistic and too long. So they got even that one wrong and made a bad mutt of a movie.Amazon's critic got confused and gave a good review to something else, that's all I can think about."
5,Zucchini,"A wonderful book. Even though some of the facts are wrong about ferrets in this book eg. fer's don't eat carrots,grain and don't befriend birds. Its is a wonderful story and it shows great character.The second book (Zucchini out west) is more fact true and is more suspensful. A real page turner. It has a surprising twist at the end, and leaves the whole story open for a trio of Zucchini books ( three). I hope there is one, becuase i hate to make up my mind what would happen next.Erin"
1,It Looked Good,"When I received the luggage rack I was very pleased. However, after my first house guest left, I discovered that one of the wooden supports (that the luggage rests on) was broken all the way through.I was disappointed and amazed. By this time I had discarded the box it came in so returning it became difficult and expensive. I would not buy from this maker again."
2,ONE BROKE THE OTHER WAS OK,I ordered two of these and wished I had ordered none. One was broken in the box and the other I had to fix after 1 week. The manufacturer could do a better job with quality assurance given the condition of the racks. I wont go down this path again.
2,Not what I expected,Not what I expected for the price I paid. They could have put some tapestry strips to upgrade to be worth what I paid..... Material doesn't cost that much !
4,Great Indie Discovery in Kyle Davis!,"I first bought Don't Tell The World from a recommendation online and immediately liked it. I just got Raising Heroes, his debut album, and I'm really loving that one too. I can't understand why this guy's not saturating the airwaves. His lyrics are far more honest and intelligent than 90% of the formulaic crap that makes up most of what every stinking mega-station plays... get a clue, all you Programming Directors, and stand up a be the person you dreamed you finally would be in this job! Play this man's music!"
4,Good Research - Terrible Organization,"I've had this book in my library for many years. It is an excellent source of reference material that you don't get in most prophetic books that cover the Book of Daniel. It is a complicated subject. But this book by John Saxon is one of the most poorly organized books I have ever read, with the same information covered over and over throughout the book. It would have been half as thick if it would have been collated properly, and would have been easier to understand."
5,"The fantastic ""Other Nunos""","This is the Nuno Mindelis project I have been waiting for. This is a radical departure from the wonderful 12 Hours CD. All the songs are in Portuguese this time, and the styles wander from track to track. Not to worry, there are blues influences to be found -- and much more. Nuno's playing is tasteful throughout, whatever the genre, and the lyrics of the self-penned songs are pure Nuno. Tenho Medo is funny and clever, the acoustic Sao Paulo is simply gorgeous. On the track Siglas (Acronyms) Nuno sounds like he's doing Polish Hip Hop. Check out the lyrics. Chove Chuva? Be there.Even if you don't know a word of Portuguese, if you love Nuno, you will want this CD. Every track will be a surprise for you, and as others have noted, Nuno Mindelis knows how to put together a coherent whole. My only regret is that before you know it the CD is over, and you are wanting more. If you've never heard Nuno, you can't go wrong with this CD."
4,Good purchase- only one minor issues,"I bought these earrings as an alternative to diamonds because I felt like I was definitely getting more carat weight for my money. They really are beautiful and unless you have jewelers scrutinizing you, I don't believe anyone wouldn't assume they were diamonds. They arrived promptly and in a white leather hinged jewelry box- very nice presentation if you were giving them as a gift. I only wish they had screw-backs or better backs in general. The backs to the earrings slide down the post to the end so the stud ends up drooping in the front. I haven't had a back come off yet- but I'm definitely going to see if I can get some better ones from a jewelry store. Honestly though- that's my only complaint and it's easily fixable. I would recommend these earrings to anyone looking for an alternative to diamonds. You can't beat the price!"
4,Good value,"Not very expensive and does a good job of covering the basics. If you are looking for in depth explanations, this is not book that you want to buy."
2,Praxis,"I used this book to study for the Praxis II Earth and Space Science Content Knowledge test. I have never taken an earth science class in my life and I am confident that I passed the test. This book has a lot of good diagrams and charts that I memorized and used on the exam (they were very useful). It also acted as a nice guide of what topics I needed to review. Unfortunately, a large portion of this book explains things very poorly. I had to refer to different websites to understand a LOT of what was going on in this book, particularly in the area of weather."
4,Good Book,"As a fan of the series, I have a bias and loyalty to the books, but I truly do think that anyone reading them will enjoy any of these. The characters are representative of their television counterparts, and the plot is good. Yes, there are a few editorial goofs, but those are easily overlooked since you know what is meant. All in all, a good fun read."
2,richards ego trip he cried!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"these books are getting worse the more i read them the more annoyed i become what happened to the writing it just seems to meander abit and go nowhere surely richard has a better concept than this either that or he needs money badly. As for apollo screwing cassie well , in real life that would end most friendships between best friends since she is stabucks ex ,obviously richard has a few fantasies where laurette sprang is concerned and wants to fufill them in the pages of this book myself i perfer maren jensen and a big tub of water and soap and sponge where i wash her down like in old playboy magazines ,however i digress we should be glad that richard never got to make his tv series if this is anything to go by ,sad he cried and roared im starting to think these books would make great paper weights, onto book five cant see it getting any better he sobbed ,but i hold out hope he cried ,that i get proven wrong ."
1,Battlestar Galactica 1980 was worse....But not by much!,"This collabration was horrible. It lacked the rhythm of the other three books, the plot was poorly written and extremely hard to follow. It brought back bitter memories of Battlestar Galactica 1980, and I'm still scarred from that.The characters seem to be weak shadows of their former selves,doing things completely alien to their TV show counterparts, like Baltar turning good? I can only blame those who worked on the book Alan Rogers and Richard Hatch and urge them to improve the quality of the story and characters in order to bring those disgusted with the current turn of events back into the fold."
1,Poorly written,I've been a fan of Battlestar Galactica since its beginning and I've enjoyed the last three books by Richard Hatch. This latest is a major disappointment. The story line was an interesting one but sorely short changed. The whole story felt rushed. The worse was the editing of the book. I had to re-read sentences to try and make sense of them. This detracted from the story and was very frustrating. I won't buy another Richard Hatch book if he collaborates with Alan Rodgers and I regret buying this book in Hardback.
1,Went from bad to worse,"As a long time fan of the television series I looked forward to this series of books by Richard Hatch. The first was o.k.. It got progressively worse with each book. Too bad Amazon doesn't allow for negative stars.Those who are familiar with the series stay away!. Otherwise be prepared for characters who have not matured in the past twenty yahrens, major mistakes in continuity and a commander with Kobollian 'super' powers. If that's not enough try just plain bad writing.If you aren't familiar with the series please, please, please do not judge it by this book. Instead check out almost any of the fanfic written by people who know the series and have actually watched the episodes; something Mr. Hatch appears to have not done since 1979."
