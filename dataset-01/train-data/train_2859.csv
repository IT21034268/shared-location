2,WASTED!,"I wasn't happy at all with this item because when I tried to burn movies into this blank DVDs, some of them did not work! I completely wasted about 4 blank DVDs. They did not work properly. I would recommend others to use different DVDs."
3,MPLS for Advanced studies but objectivity required.,"I must admit that I was quite perplexed by this book. MPLS is not my strongest area of study - this book did not help my advancement of knowledge. This is not a book to read from cover-to-cover, but best read as the requirements arise. I think the author was particularly biased towards 'pro-Cisco'. I did not see any mention of the performance degradations that can accompany MPLS implementations. Also, I think the book needed a 2nd grammatical editor, as the overall 'flow' of the book was nonevident.I give this book 3 pings out of 5:!!..!"
5,Perfect Mask,I bought this mask to compliment my Obama Mask and it is perfect! the detailing on the face resembles Clinton exactly as well as an excellent paint job.
1,good thing it was on sale,"One day is all this toy got for attention. My girls were thrilled when they got them, then annoyed when they found out that the pedals fall off constantly and that only the totally jointed hot nail Barbies can bend to fit on the bike. I'm glad it was a sale item, full price would have been a total waste of money for something that sits in the Barbie toy box."
2,Don't buy it!,"This is one of the worst toys I have ever seen. First, Barbie won't stay on the bike. Second, the wheels don't stay on the bike. Third, the pedals don't stay on the bike. Fourth, the helmet won't stay on Barbie. I can't think of anything good about this toy. It would be cute if it was made better."
2,"ultimately, it's just rubbish","I found this book on a library shelf, bascially in stacks, not in the display libraries sometimes put up to entice people to read. I'd never heard of the author and wouldn't be surprised to never hear of him again.The book actually started out kind of promising. It was hovering in category 7 for quite a while (on a scale of 1 to 10) before it began to move south. I made it to the actual middle of the book before I couldn't take it and jumped to the last chapter (which chapters, by the way, were EXTREMELY long). And in glancing through that, I discovered the same tired sophist nonsense and ""clever"" descriptions of people finally balling each other that began appearing first, it seems, in Tom Robbins novels way back when."
2,Injustice to Savatage,"I'm sorry to say that this album does not do justice to Savatage. Except for the track done by Cage, the singers are of mediocre calibre. If at least they would of stuck to the time of the original music instead of trying to improvise on the vocals too much. Being a hardcore fan of Savatage when Cris Oliva was still alive, with my loyalty diminishing after he died I think that if you really want to see what Savatage are really about, buy their original albums, don't buy only the ""Best of"" because every song on the album is the best in my book. Sava forever!!!! Cris Oliva you were a god amongst guitarists, we love you, and you will always be with your loyal fans!!! Hail to Jon Oliva too!!!"
3,"Classic text book. Good content, but buggy.","It's a classic. Pratt put a lot of work and detail into it, and it does contains the basics. It also has typo's on some (bunches) of the formula's, transforms, etc. that are annoying if you know about them (hazardous if you don't). Due to the bugs, this would not be my first choice in a DIP book, but I don't know which one would, either. If you are forced into it, find an errata for this book and mark it up, then the book will serve you well."
3,Stamping from premade stamps or originals,"I liked the book, but had hoped for more information on carving my own stamps. There was some, but I could have used more help in that area. There were some good designs that were available for people to use copyright free."
4,The whelps loved their warm nest,"The nest easily accomodated our 10 puppies for the critcal first weeks. They spent all their sleeping time huddled on it and it meant we didn't have to fiddle with heat lamps or heat that part of the house to 90 degrees. Would have been 5 stars if more reasonably pricedThe installation instructions were easy to follow, and the thermostat worked just as advertised."
2,Pretty good but not the best I've ever heard...,"I had high hopes for this album, from reviews here and also a little promotion from David Elsewhere... and it is a smooth bit of glitched-out percussion and big flowing synths.It left me feeling cold though. The tracks build up, but they never break through into anything really engaging; one of the other reviewers mentioned Ambient, and that's what this album is. When I listen to IDM I expect there to be some moment in a track that makes you nod your head or at least pulls you into some sort of rythm, and I didn't get that from this. ""Formless"" is an apt title, as the tracks kind of swirl around without taking you anywhere.For anyone who wants to hear ambient synths with good beats, I'd recommend ""Condensed"" by Lusine, on the Hymen label, or just about anything by Clark (formerly Chris Clark)."
2,Let Down,This product quit working after six months. Trying to get the company to honor the year warranty. Will let you know how this works out for me.
5,the best heating pad!,I am a massage therapist and I use this constantly! I love the fact that it will cover the whole back and that it is self moisturizing (grabs moisture from the air so you get warm moist heat). I also appreciate the auto shut off for safety. Great product.
3,misrepresentation of color,Croscill Key largo Shower Curtain appear to be white in the picture and is actually blue.
1,Helmet communication intercom,"Please don't waste your money on these. They are cheap, but then that is what you get, a cheap product. I used these Nady intercom once and put them away in the drawer then went out and bought another set (Cardo), I paid a lot more but they are so superior, highly satisfying, and I am delighted with them."
3,"Somewhat Convoluted, 3.5 stars","I am a Jeffery Deaver fan having read many of his novels. This story, like most of his others, was a page turner. His ability to make characters life like (feelings and desires we can all relate to) is certainly another one of his attributes.I believe however, the ultimate identity and goal of the Watchmaker is so deeply embedded within the plot that I found the story to be somewhat convoluted. As one reader points out, there are too many twists and turns. Initially the Watchmaker is an obvious bad guy, then maybe a good guy, no he is a bad guy. Finding the connection between Amelia Sach's case and that of Lincoln Rhymes, in addition to the discovering roles of all the various characters, at times was difficult to comprehend. Once understood it became somewhat unbelievable."
2,"Not bad, but Doubt I will read another Deaver novel.","My first and likely last Deaver novel... 1 star because I read the entire novel; a second star because some of the technical details such as kinesis, ie reading the body language of suspects was interesting. The actual storyline, with its ridiculous twists and turns, should have ended 150 pages sooner...the novel borders on pure camp. Perhaps Deaver actually meant it as such...want to make Pulp Fiction 2, Quentin?"
2,Disappointed,"It took too long to get to the point. The story didn't hold my interest. After the tenth disc, I stop listening. Not his best."
2,Condition,This is a hard back. The book is in good condition but it is missing the paper cover. It doesn't look as nice next to the others that have covers.
3,New Editor needed!,"The book was good, but dragged on and kept changing plots far to often. I usuallyl devour a book in 3 days max, but this one took me 8 days. I kept WANTING to like it and persevered. I won't be buying anything else from this author though. :( The number one distractor in the digital edition, was the MANY editing mistakes. 2 words ran on together multiple times a page. It got so if I didn't notice one I would re read the page to see if I missed it. It was incredibly distracting and something I would expect from a free e-book, not one I paid 10 bucks for. I wish I could get my money back. Oh well live and learn."
1,Pulp Fiction is Better Than This,"The most over the top, convoluted nonsense this reader has ever read. The plot twists were so implausible at the end there I was laughing out loud. My wife did a double check when she saw that I was reading a thriller and not some funny memoirs. The story's two sub plots coming together is ludicrous enough (what are the chances?)but the reader surely has to not suspend but shove all disbelief out the window when trying to swallow the layers of tricks the villain weaves just to carry out one mission.How this author can be well regarded is beyond me; are his other books slightly more realistic? I wont be finding out. One bomb is enough for me. Do yourself a favour and read some Shadow or Spider pulps from the 1930s. They are easier to swallow than this stinkeroo."
2,Got a little crazy,"The first 3/4 of the book was an absorbing mystery that unfolded in a fairly straightforward way. Then something happened. Everything went wild with more convolutions and twists, reversals and double crosses than were at all believable. It became just ridiculous and stayed that way. I actually laughed as things got more and more far-fetched. It's too bad since the author has writing talent and could do a more credible job if he only would."
3,A Bit Over the Top,"Don't get me wrong - I'm a HUGE Jeffery Deaver fan; he's one of my favourite authors. And I have a background in forensic chemistry, so I love the Lincoln Rhyme novels. But this one is probably my least favourite to date. I normally love all the twists and turns - just when you think you have it figured out, Deaver throws in another zinger - but I just feel he went a bit too far with it in this one. Still a good read, though - better than most. As much as I love the Lincoln Rhyme books, though, some of my favourite Deaver books have actually been non-Lincoln Rhyme novels (A Maiden's Grave, The Devil's Teardrop, The Blue Nowhere, Garden of Beasts). Some of his earlier works (Manhattan is My Beat, Death of a Blue Movie Star, Mistress of Justice) are really excellent, as well. Hey, Mr Deaver - how about another Parker Kincaid story???"
4,Entertaining Read,"I'm a Jeffery Deaver fan and have read most of his novels featuring Lincoln Rhyme. The Cold Moon is right up there with his previous works -- the story was entertaining and kept me engaged throughout. I enjoyed the twists, but perhaps the reader would be better served if there weren't so many. Too many twists and the storyline becomes somewhat confusing, believability gets stretched too thin, and the reader becomes overly conditioned to wait for the next big surprise to occur. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the story which had an interesting plot and featured the typical brilliantly devious criminal. The new character introductions were strong, as was the further development of previously introduced characters. I recommend this book as well as The Stone Monkey, which is my favorite Deaver effort."
2,Enough twists!,"I was disappointed in this book. It's not completely bad, but enough twists already! Lincoln Rhymes novels are interesting enough on their own (for fans of forensic and those of us who are interested in the actual main and usual characters). It doesn't need that many and sometimes outrageous twists! Leave that for the ""Twisted"" book series."
5,LOVE THESE BOOKS,I REALLY LOVE THIS SERIES OF BOOKS BY JEFFREY DEAVER. HE IS A GREAT WRITER IN MY OPINION AND HE HAS ALOT OF TWISTS IN HIS BOOKS THAT KEEP YOU GUESSING EACH STEP OF THE WAY. I ALSO LOVE HIS OTHER BOOKS THAT HE HAS WRITTEN.
4,Deaver if you dare...,"Awesome book. What a great follow up to the 12th Card. Left me hanging and had more twists and turns then any other Lincoln novel, I couldn't put this book down! Totally left me hanging, BUY IT NOW!! You won't regret it."
2,About 5 plot twists too many!,"I really enjoyed the first half of this book, a taut and riveting account of a sadistic serial killer but when the plot twists started rolling in and wouldn't let up, I pretty much lost interest. I enjoy an occasional plot twist but this borders on the absurd. This is one of the most convoluted, outrageous and unrealistic novels I've ever read. This is the first Jeffrey Deaver novel I've read and will probably be my last."
4,Fan of Deaver,"I thought the book was excellent, chilling, suspenseful and thoroughly spell-binding. I've read most of Jeffrey Deaver's books, and he is and excellent author! So happy to be reading another ""Lincoln Rhyme"" book! Keep them coming!"
3,Not So Good,"I have always enjoyed Deaver's books but this one not so much. It was slow at the start and then ended up towards the end with too many twists. It all made for an overdone, unbelievable story. Maybe he has just run out of the good stuff"
2,"Same book, different title",Will publishers please stop paying Deaver to write the same book over and over again? The characters are getting bland. I think it's time to retire Rhyme and Sachs.
2,"Great start,but unfulfilling and cheesy ending!","I am an avid fan of the Lincoln Rhyme/Amelia Sachs duo. But this story left me feeling disappointed. It started out with a bang, and made you keep the pages turning. I even survived the first AND second turn.(the rest were predictable!) But, the ending! Enough with the domestic militia and the Ted Kascinski types. Plus, the ""perp"" gets away. Left a big fan with a big disappointment. I hope the follow-up book serves it's readers a better plate of satisfaction. :)"
4,Cold Moon,This was a typical Jeffery Deaver novel. It had a few twists & turns but the ending was totally unexpected.I would recommend this for any fan of Deavers.
4,Clever murder mystery,"This is my second Lincoln Rhyme novel. The first one was ok, so I tried another. I was impressed with Cold Moon. There were twists upon twists. It kept me guessing. It's too bad that you can tell how much is left in the story. A couple times, I would have thought the story was done, but I knew there were more CD's to listen to, so something else had to happen. It stayed interesting right up to the end.The narrator did a good job slightly varying voices and accents enought to differentiate the characters and putting emotion into his reading."
3,Deep,"This is the second book of his I have read. He is very descriptive, therefore, it takes about a third of the way to really get into it. It was good, but not sure I would buy another one of his. I really dislike (in both of the books) the pages where it lists the players and what they know on each one of them, I already know this because I am reading the book duh?"
3,A real maze..,"If this book was a maze very few would get through. I love Deaver's stories and was so excited to get this before we went on vacation. Looked forward to a great read, but ,was a little disappointed. As another reader said, it does stretch credulity.Not just a little, but a lot!The introduction of Katherine Dance is brilliant. Her character is a wonderful foil for Rhyme.The relationship between Rhyme and Amelia is growing, albeit at a snail's pace. What happened to the hints of a future baby Rhyme? That was several books ago. What happened to Rhyme's slightly increasing sensations? The last book left us hoping for a little more progress.One learns that with Deaver the end, the climax of most books, is not really the end. A little twist, a little turn, and wow, the story shifts. In The Cold Moon, the shifts are unbelievable."
2,Too formulaic !,"Great disappointment. Too much detail, too little action, too much mental manipulation. I didn't bother to finish it."
5,"Intelligent, complex thriller with great main characters","Detective Amelia Sachs and Lincoln Rhyme are a formidable team on and off the job. They are called upon to help track a possible serial killer who uses the pseudonym the Watchmaker. Seemingly unconnected, Sachs is working on a supposed suicide case based out in Westchester. Sachs, Rhyme, Pulaski, and their team work in their usual methodical way listing and examining all the evidence. Kathryn Dance, a single mother, and a cop from California lends her assistance in kinesics to the case. Her interviewing skills are intriguing and she has astute cop instincts. I see the potential for a spin-off series. One suspect is caught, and their case seems to lose its gravity of importance. However, there is much more to be discovered and their main killer seems to be always one step ahead of them. A captivating addition to the Rhyme-Sachs series; it does not let you down!"
2,Tries Too Hard,"This book is like a Russian matryoshka doll. There is an initial story that seems to be wrapped up when we find it was just a smokescreen by the master criminal. That was fine but then the same thing happens 3-4 more times before we get to his real master plan. After awhile I just stopped caring. In the end the bad guy gets away so there is no real climax. Oh and as anyone paying attention for the last 10 years knows the biggest threat to the US comes from (wait for it) the religious right. The people behind the bad guys are right wing nuts. How do we know? Because one of the characters says ""they were into home schooling"". They should have been locked up just for that. The author according to his bio is a former folksinger, that fits because to me he looks like every little defenseless dweeb who got his lunch money stolen until well into college."
2,The Cold Snooze,This book starts with great promise about a sadistic serial killer but becomes so unbelievable I could not continue and gave up 3/4 of the way through - and I am glad I did after learning the ending. Deaver's need to literally 'info dump' massive plot twists is a damning testimony to the ridiculous and unworkable plot. Do not invest your time in this unbelievable story. I should have learnt my lesson after the epic snoozefest that was 'the bodies left behind'.
5,First Time,This was the first Jeffery deaver book I've read.It's a nice surprise. He keeps you guessing with twists and turns until the very end. I'm adding Deaver to my lists of writers to watch.
5,Another Great Lincoln Rhyme Book,"My husband and I are great fans of Jeffrey Deaver - and a little happy we were ""late"" in discovering the books by this talented writer. That means we have been able to read seven in this series without having to wait! His twists and turns are impossible to anticipate. The Cold Moon is well written, full of interesting characters and is well-paced. This author does his research and his books are always full of facinating information outside of the forensics. In this one he takes you to an exploration of clocks and time. I highly recommend his books - but if you are new to his Lincoln Rhymes series, start with the Bone Collector and then read them all in order. You won't be able to put them down once you start."
4,Another enjoyable novel,"I always enjoy reading Jeffrey Deaver and ""The Cold Moon"" was yet another page turner by this gifted thriller writer. Much, much, MUCH better than the dreadful ""The 12th Card"", which to be honest, I did not care for at all. Great plot, truly evil bad guy (The Watchmaker), the usual Deaver fantastical plot twists - how the hell does he constantly come up with them? - and of course, our two forensic detective superheroes, Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs. I enjoyed the addition of new character, kinesics expert, Kathryn Dance. I recommend ""The Cold Moon"" to anyone who lives the crime thriller genre. A very good read."
1,Contrived and implausible,"Filled with fairy tales of ideology. Unrealistic good guys, stereotypical bad guys (white Christian right wing extremist). I am sick of pampered entertainers trying to force their political views into my entertainment. All that aside, the story looses all credibility with the fantastic abilities of his super hero cast."
5,More twists than a WV road!,"I want to make a point but first, this is as good as it gets for mystery and clues. Typical Deaver with complicated plots, but more turns than I've ever seen in one story. He is true to his characters so character changes don't confuse the real story. Over 600 pages but you hardly notice while involved in the tangled web!However, I get annoyed by writers when they include their personal opinions on subjects not directly related to the story. In this case, Deaver makes several negative references to the death penalty. I understand the liberal philosophy of ""better to spare all criminals than execute one innocent person."" If I need a lesson in political correctness I'll read the newspaper.I'm already looking forward to the next Lincoln Rhyme book."
4,Very Enjoyable,"Chock full of great ideas and wonderful plot twists. And like a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle, it all fits together. Added to that -- three dimensional characters and many interesting thoughts, reflections, observations, and byways into interesting subjects. Perhaps marred a little bit by Deaver's tendency to build the main characters to mythic proportions and to omit shades of gray."
5,Rhyme & Sachs face their most cunning killer.,"Having read all of the Lincoln Rhyme novels I feel that this is one of the best. Rhyme and Sachs face their most cunning killer yet. Sachs is working on two separate cases. In addition, a retired cop shares some information to Sachs concerning her father. This book also involves cops on the take, more murders and clocks. Also when something goes wrong on the case that Sachs is the primary on, she finds her self being the scapegoat and endangering her career. Lin gets help from a detective who specializes in reading body language. Linc is skeptical but eventually finds her help invaluable. This was a page turner for me. I am looking forward to the next book which comes out in June. Get this book, you wont be sorry."
3,Tick Tock,"The plot changes so fast toward the end of the book, what you thought was going to happen does not happen. Deaver's plots are astonishing. I often wonder how he comes up with some of this stuff. There is no thriller writer like Jeffery Deaver. The Cold Moon will give you what you want in a thriller book. Read it tonight!d_may"
3,The Cold Moon,Not Jeff Deavers best with his favorite hero and a bit long for the available action but a good read none the less. I enjoyed it.
4,Mmmm good,"Awesome texture, not a traditional strong honey flavor...more subtle and a nice anmount of sweetness...you WILL find yourself with a tablespoon in hand just licking...guaranteed! This is nothing like honey you grew up on...unless you grew up on a bee farm. super good."
1,Dissatisfied,"Honey did not seem to be fresh, it was hard and dried out. I brought organic raw honey from another company and it was smooth and creamery. I was very disappointed in this product and want buy again"
5,finely crafted magic,"Once again, Handke tackles a difficult issue with masterful language. Upon its publication, the book received numerous negative responses by many critics who clearly had not read the piece. This carefully constructed book never ""sides"" with anyone, instead it attempts to seek out questions rather than answers. It is a dense difficult piece that is made very accessible by Scott Abbott's fine translation. I strongly recommend it and urge you to read it with an open mind."
4,Very Good Effort,"It is hard to wipe off all the mud while the mudslinging takes place. Mr. Handke should be given a lot of credit for his effort. Although sometimes tiring, his understanding of the Serb, Croat and Muslim actions and american/french/german/british arrogance (or is it ignorance or both?), offers to the reader, specially in countries like united states that have been infected by the CNN/ABC virus, an opportunity to see the other side.Unfortunately, following some points requires a better knowledge of the events, players, and history -- which is not as common nowdays.The translation made the ideas a bit confusing at some points, but overall, this is a good book to read."
1,Truly a joke,How in the world could someone given all the clear and irrefutable evidence of the Serbian war crimes and genocidal actions could someone with any common sense write such nonsense. I hear his next book will be about how the Jews were responsible for their fates in WWII.
4,If you like Risk but can't find people to play with...,"This game is a good video version of the classic board game. It not only has classic risk but also a cool ultimate version that really holds up with the best of the strategy genre. The other option for choosing your map (Classic, Europe, Western Hemisphere, Asia) really spices up the game as well. The levels do challenge you in every way. This game is very fun, challanging and finally allows one to play risk alone."
2,hmmm,I don't get it why it is not as good as the PC version. I don't like the fact that you can't see the entire world map with all your countries and armies at once (just like the Risk2 PC game) but instead have to move from one continent to another.
2,They really should have easy and difficult ratings!,"The only thing I really didn't like about this game was the difficulty ratings. The computer is extremely hard to beat in the multi-player games, even when the ""easy"" setting is at its peak. That made it discouraging to continue with. They really need to make those settings match, or why bother having them?"
2,NT/UNIX whatever.. It ain't funny..!,"Ok.. I read the rave reviews, and as a Windows/UNIX long-time user, it sounded great and i got the book.BUT, geek or not, Windows/UNIX man or not, it simply is NOT funny. I'm sorry to break it to all the fans, but this book is NOT funny even to a techguy like me. Not to mention Computer newbies that will through this book away after a few pages.So, techie or not, I simply found the humor to be NOT FUNNY!"
1,"Boring, unfunny rubbish","I work in the IT industry and the reviews of this book made me go out and buy it. What a complete waste of time and money. The so-called 'in jokes' are more or less all about the fact that Windows has the tendency to crash every now and then. Wow! we didn't know that, thanks for the info. The characters are boring non-entities that you just can't form a connection with. The strips are completely humor free and poorly drawn. I actually found the book quite depressing. I know humor is a very hit-and-miss subject where something makes you role on the floor laughing hysterically but your friend can't see the joke at all. This book, however, I find impossible to believe that anyone could enjoy. ... Stay well clear of it and buy some Dilbert instead."
1,Didn't do it for me..,"Nope, not funny at all. Nowhere near the likes of Dilbert. Being a computer professional and unix user, I've heard so many Microsoft-is-evil kinda jokes that its not funny anymore. But I never thought someone would actually write a 122 pages book repeating the same idea over and over and over and over again. A pathetic excuse of a comic book."
5,Worth the money - easily,"Out of all the cartoon books I've bought in my life, this is the only one to ever top Calvin and Hobbes on my list of favorites."
4,Good Solid Shooter,This game is a very generic shooter as most were in the time of the snes. Most of them though were very entertaining and a staple for anyone of the time. D-Force is a good stable shooter for anyone to enjoy and I highly recommend it considering how cheap it is now.
4,Desaster in British submarine,"This film is a good addition to one's WW2 war movie collection. The film is about a submarine that is damaged by a floating mine and the following rescue attempt. After this film was made a real and similar event took place.Not everyone on board handles to frightening situation well. Hopes are raised and dashed, raised and dashed again until the end of the ordeal."
5,Very easy and effective for full-figured people of all ages.,"The people in the video are of varying sizes, but all full-figured, which makes a full-figured person more comfortable in following along. It's pace is easy to keep up with. It includes warm-ups, cool- downs, floor exercises, stretches, and a guide that helps you see if you are exercising in your fat burning range based on your age."
5,Better Than I Expected,"This video is great! It offers 5 sections: Warm up, Cardio 1, Cardio 2, Cardio 3, Cool down, Floor stomach and leg exercises, and stretches. Whew! I thought I could do this video with no problem but I underestimated it. This is a complete workout and I'm VERY happy with this purchsae."
2,Disappointing series,"So it's pretty obvious this series (The Prodigal Project) is riding on the coat tails of the success of the other Christian apocalyptic series Left Behind. That was why I initially checked it out. I read the first three books, discovered the fourth could not be checked out from the library, so I bought it here on Amazon.The shipping and actual product I received from this seller were fine, but if you want my opinion, don't bother buying this book or reading this series. Why?1. It's a knock off of a more popular series2. It's characters and their development strain credulity, even for apocalyptic sci-fi3. This is the LAST BOOK published, even though it is not the end of the series. What that means is that you will get involved in a storyline and it will abruptly drop off here (there is no book five), presumably because the books stopped selling.Waste of time."
4,Dramm makes the best,"This model is not nearly as good a quality as the made in USA forged model, but is still far better than those breaker nozzles found on wands at Lowes and other big box stores. While I have not used this nozzle long, I can tell by its construction that it will outlast the more competitively priced ones. If you like really top quality tools however, pay the extra and buy the Dramm 400. That nozzle should last a lifetime and more!"
4,Very Good CD,I recommend this CD to all of you who wants a well recorded cd with several great songs.
2,EARLY BIRD ALERT - DON'T CATCH THESE WORMS!,"THE WORMS CRAWL IN THE WORMS CRAWL OUTTHAT'S WHAT THIS MOVIE IS ALL ABOUT...Too bad it's not all that frightening. This addition to SyFy's prolific amount of giant creecher feechers offers nothing new and even durable Sean Patrick Flanery bombs. The rest of the cast is downright awful. Producer/actor Andrew Stevens pops up out of nowhere in a who is this guy role and gets sucked up by a killer worm!! WTF?I've enjoyed a lot of these SyFy ""originals"" but this certainly isn't one of their shining moments."
1,Don't bother,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's low grade can be attributed to a marginal plot, and poor acting performances throughout. Even the flesh eating grubs or so called death worms leave alot to be desired. Don't waste your time on this one!"
3,Maille Originale Squeeze bottles tastes different than glass jars.,"I ordered the 12 pack of the Maille squeeze bottle mustard. But was pretty ticked to find that the flavor in the squeeze bottles is different, not as hot as the glass jars. I assume this is because they need to be thinner in consistency. Before writing this review I went and bought a jar of the Originale mustard and compared it to one of the many squeeze bottles I have left. There is a clear difference in taste. The jars have a hotter mustard flavor, and better in my opinion. Now, even the squeeze bottles taste better than any processed mustard out there, but this review is to let everyone clearly know, what the seller of the cases of squeeze bottles should have kindly told their buyers:Maille Originale MUSTARD in the SQUEEZE BOTTLES TASTE LIGHTER THAN THE MAILLE ORIGINALE in the JARS.The sellers need to do a little better on the disclosure."
2,If your not an *Absolute* Beginner,"If your not an Absolute Beginner... If you have at least some background with programming... This book probably is not for you.I'm only through the first 9 chapters of this book and I'm having a hard time staying awake while reading it... Perhaps if I was a true beginner I'd appreciate his methods, but to me it seems like the author was paid by the word. Which is to say he uses three paragraphs to say one sentence of meaningful information. And he repeats himself several times (at least in the first three chapters of the book)I wish the guys who wrote the PHP manual could do one for VBScript."
4,"Not perfect, but useful","I had done some programming 20+ years ago and wanted an introduction to VBScript. The idea of a review of current programming practice seemed like a good idea, too. There were some interesting errors in the code in a few lessons, as I found. They provided practice in debugging, for what that was worth. The lessons are pretty clear and I found some interesting ways of modifying the scripts as given. It worked for me."
5,"Without question, the best book for practical application of vbscript!",This book is chok full of learning projects that solidify the concepts presented. The cd that comes with the book includes an editor tool that has proved invaluable. I'm getting a second copy as mine has gone missing.
2,not what I had hoped for,"The examples are wrong which is making things harder to understand and the web site for the book doesn't have an amendment section but it does have the scripts which seem to be working, so far anyway.I know just enough about scripting to steal somebody else's working script and get it to work for my needs but I was looking to get a true understanding of VBSripting.I have not yet completely finished the book but I feel I have wasted my money.I'll update when I have finished but want to give others a heads up."
1,Nixon Politically Incorrect Adult Halloween Mask,"I purchased this product on line 3 weeks before Halloween and it never showed up. The charges were processed on my credit card and one day before Halloween still I had no mask. Halloween came and went but still no mask was ever delivered. I tried contacting the seller and post office, but had no luck. Finally I contacted Amazon to get a refund for my purchase. This year I had no Halloween costume!"
4,Great!!,"The mask is high quality, just as good (if not better) than anything I would've gotten in a local Halloween store.It isn't very good for wearing a long time - and the eye holes suck to your face and can be extremely uncomfortable. Once you cut out the eye-holes a little to customize it to your face, and tuck the chin under a little it's fine."
3,Hilarious and reasonably realistic,"I rate it a 3 because of the fit. Very difficult to wear due to the eye holes - actually hurts. Suspect that's my anatomy, but a ""unisex"" item that's only limited to a small subset of folks seems rather pointless."
4,Wow!,"Very elegant and good-looking dress watch. The absence of markings is not important since one does not need to know the time upto the exact minute on normal occasions. Otherwise, cell phones can be used to tell the exact time. With its black and golden color, it can be worn with virtually any outfit. Caution for those who follow current fashions of oversized dials - this dial is not very big."
2,A mixture of confusing genre and style,"Although I have enjoyed books by Roger Elwood in the past, I found this one to be confusing in both style and storyline. The characters talk and behave as if they lived in medival Europe. There are even knights on horses; yet, this story takes place in modern times and supposedly deals with biological warfare. A biological threat is the crux of the story but Elwood weaves subplots throughout the novel revealing very little about the main idea. Because of the clashing styles and the scant attention given to the main plot, this book has a sense of ""unreality"" that makes it hard for the reader to enjoy or understand the story."
3,mysteries,Cam Jansen is a clever girl. She is raising money for chariity by doing a play. She gets the money by the tickets people pay for to watch the play. When the play started the money was stolen. With her mental camera she solved the problem.
5,"Industry standard, or at least should be....","What can I say, I think $50 is a little high but the quality is very good. Would buy another without hesitation.."
1,Not Good,Installed it correctly and it leaked where the bottom clear plastic attached to the filter. Possibly the rubber o ring or gasket was defective.
2,Having problems with leaking,"everything hooked up great except for the lower unit, it started leaking so i siliconed the gasket, and now the water screw on the bottom leaks."
4,"Lots of tractors, some trains, few trucks","If your child likes trucks, he or she won't find many in this video. The primary emphasis is on an incredible variety of farm tractors, with a secondary emphasis on passing shots of passenger and freight trains. Trucks finish a distant third on this tape. Having said that, my four-year-old son and 2.5 year daughter really like it -- which surprises me because my son has always shown a keen interest in trucks, not tractors. They also like the soundtrack quite a bit, which features a catchy song. Bottom line: I have found other kids' videos more interesting, but I don't have a vote here -- my kids do. And they vote an enthusiastic 'Yes' for this one."
3,Truck Tractor Train video,"My 2 year old nephew Christopher enjoys this video. Glare distorted views of the trucks, which were not in abundance. There could have been more close up and better quality views of trucks, showing interiors, drive trains, connecting to trailers, etc."
1,Wish I could return this one,This might be a good video if we could see it. My VCR auto tracks so we saw the tractors but not the trains or trucks. this one will collect dust on the shelf.
5,"Thank you, Clay!","This CD is a gift from the heart. Beautifully produced and joyfully sung. It's one of those albums that will never go out of style. Nice mix of Christmas songs and carols. Love it, love it, love it!"
5,Such a Lovely Christmas Album - Gives Me Goosebumps!,"I was expecting this to be an outstanding album but it's even better than I thought it would be! First class production, wonderful arrangements, and of course Clay Aiken has the most mesmorizing voice. The insert includes the lyrics to all the songs so you can sing along but I don't think you'll want to - you'll just want to lean back in a chair, close your eyes and bask in the beauty of this album. This album contains all my favorite Christmas songs: O, Holy Night; Mary, Did You Know; The Christmas Song; Sleigh Ride, etc. oh and it also includes Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas which is better than Judy Garland's original. Honest to God! Clay Aiken makes every song he sings his own and after you hear him sing these Christmas songs you will discover that everyone else's version will pale in comparison."
3,Not overly impressed,"I don't know... I was expecting something else. I mean, undoubtedly, Clay has a voice that is synonymous with powerfully melodic, so I think it was a fair expectation that a Christmas album would be nothing short of delectable to the ears. Yes, his voice was beautiful. But the music didn't mesh well with his near-perfect Broadwayesque sound, so the overall emotion died. It was like an AWESOME singer doing karaoke to an elevator-music-styled Christmas carol. Needless to say, I'm a bit disappointed; even my all-time favorite tune, ""O HOLY NIGHT,"" just didn't do it for me because of the lack of a cohesiveness between his magnetic voice and the dull instrumental background. It's not a horrible album. But it just barely increased the jolliness that usually peaks when I hear good holiday tunes."
3,uninspiring,this is really uninspiring... boring... i really liked Clay's debut album and expected that he would perform well with x'mas songs... but he seems to lack emotions when singing these songs....
1,Overblown,"Clay Aiken is a Aight Singer,but the kind of dap he gets is way too much to me.middle of the road already without having even a halfway decent cut to roll with is a bit much too soon to me.if He makes a Album like this in say 10 years if anyone still cares then I'll know where he is at as a Artist,but as of now I ain't heard anything halfway decent that merits all the hype.then again it's typical American Idol Smoking mirrors.time will tell."
1,Oh Brother,"In the words of ""Simon"", I'm sure you all know who he is:, this album is absolutely ghastly. I felt like i was listening to the exact same song, over and over and over and over...well you get the idea. I wouldnt suggest you buy this cd, you want Christmas music, go ahead and Amazon-Up a little Christina Aguilera...now that is talent."
2,Better than some not as good as others.,"I actually think this guy should have won American Idol when it got down to him and Ruben ( although I thought Kim Locke was the best that year ) but I digress. I openly admit I'm not Clays biggest fan so should you buy this cd? hey they are christmas songs and you can never go wrong with that. So I say... go ahead and purchase it. No it's not some steller cd that makes you go wow but it's like I said... ""it's a christmas cd so go for it. Heck, even the chipmunks had a hit christmas album :)"
2,"Uhh, What was he thinking","Caly Aiken, disappointed me in this CD. He did not do a good job singing the songs. He makes great classics boring and dull. Clay, you didn't win American Idol, and now I know why. Nice try, Clay, but my advice to you; is to show more energy when your singing the songs, put some character into in. If your into nice and soothing music that is kinda just nothing, this CD is right for you. But if you like exciting music, don't bother with this one."
5,A Claymate's Opinion,"As a Clay Aiken fan I adore anything he sings! But when he sings his Christmas songs he is just breathtaking! Nobody in the music world today touches me the way Clay does! All anyone would have to do is listen to him and if they were honest they would have to admit, he is the greatest!"
5,Beautifully Done,"I love Christmas music. Normally I listen to either Perry Como or Bing Crosby because, for me, nobody does it better than them.So, one night I'm dial surfing and stop at someone singing Mary Did You Know. No vacal gymnastics just straightforward, sincere and true. When the announcer said Clay Aikens I was surprised. That guy from American Idol? No way!Beautifully done. I am now a fan."
5,My favorite so far!!!!!!!!!,My daughter reccommended this CD as her favorite Christmas CD so I bought one and I agree. Love his voice
5,Absolutely Amazing,Clay Aiken keeps topping himself with his music. The album is terrific--very soothing--very classic--very pleasant listening. His vocals are fabulous. Don't Save It All For Christmas Day and Mary Did You Know are incredible. This album is a must have.
5,Wonderful Holiday Album,"Clay Aiken's Merry Christmas With Love is one of those albums you don't just listen to during the holiday season. I know my family and I will listen to it year-round and will never get tired of it. Every song is sung with such passion and love that it will reach into the hearts of everyone, from children to senior citizens. Clay's voice is born to sing these great holiday classics and and I know this album will be played and cherished for many years to come."
5,A classic,"This is how Christmas songs are supposed to be sung. Beautiful classical orchestral arrangements, beautiful instrumentation and great production values topped by a gorgeous, clear soaring voice. O' Holy Night is simply the best version of this song I've ever heard. Hark The Herald Angels Sing/O' Come All Ye Faithful and Mary Did You Know are two other outstanding versions, although it is hard to pick favorites when all the songs are so good. This CD is destined to become a perennial Christmas favorite."
5,The Very Best!,"Clay gives me chills. I love every single song. My top three are Dont Save it All For Christmas Day, Oh Holy Night and Merry Christmas With Love. His voice is like nothing I have ever heard and I can't get enough of him. His voice makes me laugh and smile every day. I only hope that you will give him a try to see what I mean. He is not going anywhere but UP! Thank God For Clay!"
5,Perfection,"I am 52 years old and have been listening and prefer classic Christmas songs for many yrs and I have to say, I have never enjoyed or appreciated them like I do now. Clay's voice is simply put perfection. You feel it in your heart and soul with every note he sings. Thank you Clay for such a wonderful gift to us."
5,Classic Perfection,"I have been looking for a classic Christmas CD for years now. Here it is. The incredible vocal talent of Mr. Aiken, accompanied by an orchestra, delivers a Christmas album that is destined to be a favorite for years to come. My father and my daughter purchased this CD, and they both love it. This is truly a holiday music collection that bridges the generation gap. My personal favorites are Mary, Did You Know, Don't Save It All For Christmas Day, the title song, Merry Christmas With Love, and What Are You Doing New Years Eve? The vocal performance and arrangement is unequaled on Mary, Did You Know?. The CD also has the traditional songs that we all love. Hope everyone loves it as much as we do. Merry Christmas!"
5,My NEW favorite Christmas album!!,"I was so psyched to get this home and listen! As all of the 5 STAR reviews say, this is a winner! They actually did quality mixing and vocal adjustments that make Clay sound like he should! These standards do have a few musical variations, so it isn't boring to listen to. My favorites include: Mary Did You Know, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas and Merry Christmas With Love - what a great title track!I do have one complaint: Couldn't they have done a classy cover? The CD cover is not up to par for a Clay release. Shame on you RCA!!Get this CD! You'll love it!"
3,Don't let the stars fool you!,"It's not for the entire CD -I haven't heard it. I just saw him do a televised version of ""Mary, Did You Know?"". I'm giving this one song 3 stars. This song will become a standard for this season: simple, subtle arrangements; vocals that enter in as softly as a whisper used to rouse a sleeping baby; and lyrics that give you pause and cause to inwardly reflect. I would love this song alone as a CD single."
5,Merry Christmas With Love,"Clay has a wonderful voice and he sings better than anyone out there.Since i brought Merry Christmas With Love I just can,t stop listening to it.I love all the songs on this cd.And Clay,s voice really shines on this cd.B.FORBES Baltimore,MD"
5,AWESOME!AWESOME!AWESOME!AWSOME!!!,"I've only been listening to clips of this Album and I already think it is the best! I pre-ordered it AND I CAN""T WAIT TO GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!He has more variety this tim, i find, even though its on the same topic. Anyways, I love this Album and if you are trying to find if it's any good..well..let's just say you'll love it. I LOVE IT!!!!!!"
4,A Must Have Christmas Album,"Clay Aiken once again displays that ever-so-unique voice that catapulted him to fame in the first place. Though this CD lacks the incredibly moving ""The First Noel"" that he performed on the American Idol Holiday Special, nearly every song on this album is worth the buy. The traditional songs are definitely the best, while some of the new songs take a few listens to grow warm to. Still, this is an album that certainly makes those cold winter nights curled up by the fireplace with a cup of cocoa all that more enjoyable."
3,Not what I thought,"I brought this CD for one particular song and was happen with that, but the other songs did not sound so hot"
5,CLASSIC CHRISTMAS CD,This is an INCREDIBLE Christmas CD! Definitely a CLASSIC! Perfect for Christmas presents. CLAY IS AWESOME ON THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!! It is SO beautiful! Amazing!
5,SUPER-FANTASTIC!,"HOW CAN ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO THIS AWESOME CHRISTMAS CD GIVE IT ANYTHING LESS THAN 5 STARS? ""MARY DID YOU KNOW"" AND ""DON'T SAVE IT ALL FOR CHRISTMAS DAY"" ARE NOW MY FAVORITE CHRISTMAS SONGS! CLAY HAS AN INCREDIBLE VOICE AND PEOPLE WHO THINK OTHERWISE DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT! CLAY AIKEN BASHERS ARE JUST POOR, PATHETIC SOULS WHO ARE VERY JEALOUS OF HIS POPULARITY! GET USED TO CLAY'S PRESENCE BECAUSE HE'LL BE AROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME!"
5,This is the Best,"I have quite a few Christmas CD's. I love Christmas music. This is over the top my new favorite. I don't think I've ever heard Christmas songs, sung with such real passion. Most Christmas albums by my favorite artists are good. Just nice music to get you into the holiday spirit. Some beautifully sung, some just fun. This album embraces the real spirit of Christmas. Songs like Mary Did You Know, Oh Holy Night, Silent Night and Don't Save It All For Christmas are not only beautifully sung by a very talented singer - they bring a Christmas album to a whole new level. Plus a few of the songs are just lively fun like Winter Wonderland and Sleigh Ride. This one will be around for a long time."
5,Not just for Clay fans,"Although I am a Clay fan, this Christmas album is for anyone who likes Christmas albums. Unlike many other artists, Clay doesn't mess with the classics. He plays it straight and the result is beautiful. The traditional O Holy Night is spectacular. I had never heard Mary Did You Know before, but it has now become a favorite. Definitely a Christmas-music must-have!"
1,I was soo dissapointed!,"I am a huge Clay fan and this was a step down for me. I love Measure of A Man, but this Christmas CD is seriously bad. His voice is not showcased as well as in prior CD's. Also, the quality of the music is not THAT great. Please Clay.. never make a Christmas CD ever again!"
3,good voice as usual,"Clay's voice is great, there is no denying that but in listening to CD I'd say the CD is wholly uninspiring. The first three songs blend together. There ARE however exceptions, Mary Did You Know is awesome as is Hark the Herald Angels and Mary Christmas with Love! Clay's rendition MDYK is probably the best I've ever heard. I'd say if you're a huge Clay fan you'll love this CD without question, if you like Christmas music, which is usually pretty bland to begin with, you may like this CD also. However if you're looking for Christmas music with a kick to it, this CD falls short. Clay's voice provides what it has always provided, technical perfection without much emotion behind it."
1,More Christmas songs?,"Clay's rather bland singing style make this album quite boring. None of these are very memorable Christmas carols... the album could have been better, much better."
3,meh..i'd give it 2 1/2 stars if there was that option,"Not too bad. Vocals are a little weak and screamy, but I have heard worse. I would recommend Mariah's Christmas album over this one though."
5,"Moving, Encouraging, Wonderful","Clay Aiken urges us all to love and encourage each other so much more this Christmas and holiday season. His singing moves me and brings encouragement to my heart on any day. Because his renditions of the songs and vocal performances are astounding, you get a Christmas CD that ranks with the best. People like Clay Aiken make times so much more bright and caring through both their singing and character. I am thrilled that I have this album and encourage everyone to look in to purchasing it."
4,Very Good,I was very impressed with his voice. He didn't try to change the songs to fit him which would be bad because they were all classic christmas songs. Very nice.
5,Not Just For Christmas!!!,"What's great about this album is that it's not just for Christmas. You can play it anytime. It has the feel of a regular album, but with Christmas spirit. You can enjoy it with the same enthusiasm as your other CD's. Clay's voice lifts all of the songs to higher plateau. If you didn't get his first album, then this CD would be a good place to start. And if you have his first CD, then I would highly recommend this sterling follow-up. Don't miss out."
5,Clay Deserves a Standing Ovation!!,"WOW! Clay you are Wonderful! This is a MUST buy! Fan or not you like Christmas music you will LOVE this CD! ""Don't Save It All for Christmas Day"" and ""O, Holy Night"" are Must listens you will we be amazed! ""Mary Did you Know"" is very chilling and haunting and just plan beautiful! There are no bad songs at all! In this day and age it is wonderful that we have Clay Aiken to just listen too and relax too. Dance to this CD, eat dinner listening to this CD. Play it and buy it for friends. I have a feeling they won't be disappointed! =) Thanks again Clay for your amazing gift and being a wonderful NORMAL humble person and your God given voice! Merry Christmas! =)"
5,BEST IN THE WORLD!,I don't think it can get better than this (if it's not Clay of course). I've been listening to this album and reading Learning to Sing and i dont think i could be more than satisfied! CLAY I LOVE YOU! It's absolutely breath taking and never have I loved something more! ANOTHER CD TO THE CLAY COLLECTION!! WOOO HOOO! I LOVE YOU SOO MUCH CLAY! THANK YOU!! This is recomended to all who love traditional X-mas music!
5,AMAZING,"Clay has done it again. I am never ceased to be amazed by how he could stunn us week in and week out on American Idol, then his summer tour was flawless, and Measure of a Man -- need I say more. I love this Christmas Album. Don't Save It All for Christmas Day is so great. He has made his place in everyone's hearts and this album will continue to do so."
5,Clay does it again!,"I have been a Clay fan since I first saw him during the AI auditions. His voice is amazing and I love his morals. He is truly a humble person, something rare in Hollywood and the music industry these days. All that aside, this CD is amazing. I have to disagree with the reviewer who claims he ""falters"" on O, Holy Night. I think he nailed it. The whole CD rocks!! I highly recommend this CD. I can't say enough good things about it. Became my favorite as soon as I heard it!"
5,Clay Aiken Christmas,I love this... I have always enjoyed Christmas music and have quite a collection of great cds. This will definitely be one of my all time favorites. Beautiful! Inspiring! Touching! Buy one for yourself and all of your friends...Mary Did You Know really touched my heart...
5,Merry Christmas with Love,Merry Christmas with Love est tout simplement fabuleux! Clay Aiken a une voix d'or. Il interprète ses classiques de Nol d'une faon sublime. Merry Christmas With Love est définitivement un Classique a se procurer que vous pourrez écouter années après années.
5,Merry Christmas With Love Shines!!,Great Christmas album. Songs are all well produced and beautifully sung. Marvelous first Christmas album effort!!
2,GREAT CHRISTMAS CD,THIS IS A GREAT CHRISTMAS CD.I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE SONG MARY DID YOU KNOW SUNG BY CLAY.I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.TRY IT YOU'LL LIKE IT!!!!!!!!!
5,Excellent!!!,This CD is more than I ever hoped for. It's an excellent holiday album for the entire family. Please give Clay a chance and check out this awesome collection of Christmas songs. You will not be disappointed.
3,Amazing,"I've listened to this album quite a few times through. There's a few songs I don't like (Joy To the World, What You Doing Near Years Eve,O Holy Night and Herald/Faithful) but Clay's versions of songs like Don't Save It All For Christmas Day, The Christmas Song and Mary Did You Know (basically the rest of the songs) are amazing. Great job Clay."
5,Merry Christmas With Love,"I love this CD. Clay again shines with his wonderful voice. The orchestra behind him compliments his voice, so powerful and pure. Thank you Clay, for once again giving to your fans.Duckie"
5,Clay's CD will touch your heart and give you joy!,"Clay's voice is front & center on this Christmas CD -- the way it should be. OHN is soaring and SN is sung as a lullaby -- it will take your breath away. MDYK is so beautiful & haunting; MCWL will bring a few tears; and DSIAFCD is so amazing -- I have not words for that note and key change --it touches the heavens! All the Carols on this CD will take you back to Christmases of years ago as you remember family & friends, decorating your tree and wrapping presents. Merry Christmas with Love is a CD for the ages, a classic that will remain so -- just like the music of Bing & Frank. Thank you Clay, you have created a beautiful and special CD for all of us."
5,Decided to finally listen to a Clay Aiken CD,"Yup. I get it now. Great voice. Just great. I listened beginning to end twice before I could stop. Sleigh Bells, Silent Night, What are You Doing New Year's eve turned my world black and white with memories of the old movies at Holiday time and my Michigan world covered in snow. I particularly liked Don't save it all for Christmas Day. The message is almost""urgent"" as he belts and begs for love year 'round. He lets it go at the end of the song with a glory note to rival anything I have hard on a Christmas song. His Oh Holy Night and Mary Did You Know are beautiful, hauntingly beautiful.I will be picking up his singles and his debut CD. Curious to hear more."
3,Very Simple,"I am currently taking the full organic chemistry sequence over the summer. Although, these movies were helpful during the first few chapters. It was disappointing that they did not cover the entire course sequence (I had expected that they would). Honestly, the material they present are the easier topics in organic chemistry. Basic addition, elimination and substitution for (alkanes, alkenes and alkynes). If you need help with your first term of o-chem then these movies might help you but be aware they do not cover anything more advanced than that. Also although there are some cute ladies teaching this stuff the humor in this video is rather sub-par.Specific to this video: This first video was the least helpful and was more of a broad overview of stuff covered in general chemistry."
2,unhappy,was unhappy that I received a vhs movie when I could have gotten a dvd copy for a couple dollars more and amazon never sent me the return info
4,Pine Nuts,"Good quality; arrived on time. Only wish they'd have a set of 3 or 4 packs too, apart from the 6 pack"
1,Totally Frustrating! A real bust!,"I bought this toy for my granddaughter ... it slips and slides all over the place ... the console portion of it kept falling down. You play your own music and the beat of the music doesn't match the beat of the Dance Maker. She is 8 years old, loves to dance but was so frustrated that in less than an hour we decided it was a total bust and returned the toy ..."
2,dancemaker make it stop,"the concept is fun and you really can get a good physical work out, but there is no way to stop the sequence of lights on the dance pad until the cycle is complete. That's frustrating the cycle last 3 minutes if not longer. There is no on/off or pause switch. There is no information on what the dance sequences are suppose to look like. It reminds me of the game simon as a floor mat I guess it is ok."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I received this game for Christmas 2003 and even the person who got it for me thought it was rubbish and said so. I coudn't beleive there wasn't any music until I had spent 10mins looking for it. The levels were rubbish too. one level was really slow, the next level slightly faster and the last level way too fast. If you tried putting music to it the dance doesn't fit to the music.I spent 5mins playing with it and then put it away for good."
3,Rare Soul,Vol 1 was by far the best. Seems the more volumes come out the less exciting they get. Vol 6 was pretty boring. We will see what vol 7 brings later this month.
1,Valis IV,"I enjoyed playing this game up until the last level. When I got to the last boss character, I discovered that he's impossible to defeat because you lose all of your health for no apparent reason. I didn't appreciate this ""joke"" the game played on the player. As a result, I dismantled it and am donating the circuit board to an electronics recycling center so no other gamer will feel my frustration."
1,These will NOT fit MSR Evo Tour Snow shoes,The web page fails to mention what styles of Snow Shoe this will fit. It only fits the Denali line of MSR. Evo Tour will only accept 6 in. tails. Do NOT buy if you have EVO TOUR style.
3,Great Starting Point,"Looking for a used BMW? Start here. While not uber-detailed from a technical standpoint, the information is well- organized and well-presented with fine photos. I refer to the book often as a memory refresher and ""what to look for"" reminders. That doubles its value in my mind: A buyer's reference and later a model reference -- a keeper for me! Remember -- it's current only to the early 2000's."
3,Not part of Disassembled,"Right off the bat I want to make this clear: this story has nothing to do with Avengers Disassembled. Captain America is prominent, and Iron Man as well as a few other heroes, including the X-Men, show up towards the end, but that's where the connection ends.As far as a Spider-man book goes, the story is so-so, focusing more on new villainess The Queen, a human-bug hybrid, than on our Spectacular hero. When he does make his costumed appearance it's nothing short of spectacular, it's just that those appearances are found only in the beginning and briefly in the end of the book. Far too few for a Spider-hungry fan.Of main importance here is Spider-man's transformation into more arachnid than scientist when he's given the ability to shoot webs from his arms rather than from ingeniously created web spinners.If you are following the Spectacular Spider-Man books, pick this up. But if you're interested in The Avengers Disassembled, stick to the main arch."
4,Not just for teenagers,"Although Amanda's book was written for the teen audience, the info here is so universal a non-teen, like me, can enjoy it and refer to it over and over. Amanda's strength is her ability to make complex topics very clear and to communicate so everyone can understand their chart. This book found me out of the blue and I am glad it did."
2,Ness does tend to exaggerate a bit,"I've read this book and I think that Elliot Ness did exaggerate a bit. Yes, he may have been in the team set out to capture Capone, he may even have been the group leader but in the book he does exaggerate his bravery and the risks he took. I would not recommend this book if you don't like reading lies."
3,Great Game... BUT>>>,"I really liked this game compared to earlier video game versions. I dont like the write you own name feature... Im not at all fond of how dark the board is.. and how much we have to adjust the color and brightness on our screen to see the board, then adjust it back when we are finished. The questions are difficult and exactly what we hoped. Answering is rather difficult at first, and the auto complete is nice, except you have to be really careful... learned that the hard way... I would have given it 5 stars, but the dark screen and S---L----O----w loading of the game decided against that..."
4,come down special,"I first heard this album after a heavy night of psychadelic insanity. The music is mellow but not bedtime material. Perfect for kicking back, smoking a bone and retrospect over the night. I can't hear this album anymore without chills running up my spine. No organic sounds, all computer/keyboard generated, but a bit different from his other electronic works. Check it out."
3,Bonide Rotenone,Must not be a high percentage of Rotenone. Does not kill potato bugs like previously purchased Rotenone.
2,Disappointng quality,"We purchased Magnetic Mosaics for our 6 year old daughter, thinking it would be similar to Fractiles which we have all enjoyed for 3 years. We were very disappointed to find that it was just cheap craft foam squares with a weak magnetic backing and that the board is a flimsy cardboard. (Fractiles are real magnet pieces with a stiff, metal board)It took our family of 5 a half hour to separate all of the tiny foam squares that were scored but not cut apart. The foam mosaic pieces slip out of place or off the board easily if not laying flat. The cost of the product far exceeds the value of it due to its very low quality."
2,Not much fun!,"My 6 year old daughter received this as a gift. Just want to warn parents that the over 2,000 pieces need to be separated by you! They are tiny foam colored magnetic pieces that the child can use to create scenes. Looks fun but she got frustrated. Comes with examples but she is to young to try to make most of them. The backdrop is solid black or white and there are no templates. Really makes child use their imagination which is good, but if they want to recreate ones in book it is more difficult. Also, make sure they are done on a table. If you let your child make them on the floor they can easily be messed up. Magnetic pieces are so small they move easily. Maybe better for an older child."
4,Good Shoes,"I bought these as a gift for my fiance. At first I was not sure of the design they had, but he said that they are very comfortable. Than is what is most important to me."
2,order bigger!!!!,Nice looking skate shoe but way too samll. Ended up giving them away rather than hassle with the return. Order at least 1 full size bigger
3,Wheel of Fortune Review,"I bought this game to replace the one I had that got damaged from wear and tear over the years. I don't play it very often, but when I do I enjoy it."
4,Renee Fleming...somewhat out of her depth,"While it's not the most thrilling Renee Fleming album in the catalogue, her interpretations of Handel pieces is quite an accomplished feat, but when compared to her earlier efforts, rings hollow with it's lack of emotion. As other reviewers have noted, Ms Fleming does not sound like she is in complete grasp of the material, and her performance lacks any real depth or dramatic weight.Perhaps the pieces of Handel aren't completely flattering to her style, or the mood in the recording studio might not have been exactly right...a million things might have happened to dull this album's power. I have listened to this album a couple of times now, and I'll keep it in my collection, but this one is for the die-hard Renee Fleming fans.[Decca /Universal 475 547-2]"
3,"Stellar singing, but historically inaccurate","Ms. Fleming's voice is clear and colorful - gorgeous as always. Unfortunately, she has not made good use of musicological discoveries regarding Handel's arias, particularly concerning the use of embellishment in the repeated A sections of da capo arias. This is Baroque music, and Baroque means ""ostentatiously and elaborately ornamented."" (Schulenberg) Given that the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment specializes in music of this era, I would have expected better."
2,"Okay, But Not Great....","At the risk of accusation of heresy, I find Fleming's voice beautiful and creamy, yet profoundly boring. I hear little difference in characterization from one aria to another. Everything sounds the same to me - lovely yet complacent. She has undoubtedly a very beautiful voice, but there is no risk, no vulnerability, no challenge, no agony, I hear nothing in her singing but placid self-satisfaction. Buy instead Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, or Viveca Genaux, or Marilyn Horne, or Beverly Sills, or Robert White, or.... There is emotional heart and heat in Handel's arias, but here I hear only a creamy coolness."
5,Simply Marvelous,"My review of this album will be short and sweet. In listening to the tracks on here, I sat there just overcome by the sheer beauty of Ms. Fleming's voice: there are so many colors and so much dynamic control. Though it may sound odd, before I bought this, I listened to the Xerse aria- a standard to all those who have ever sung in even a slightly classical style. In that aria, so many incredible moments of music occured. I found myself wondering in how she takes even the most basic music and finds the smallest details to create a shining new jewel of an aria. Truly, this is how Handel would want his music sung. And for anybody who says that her ornamentation is over-the-top: there are several manuscripts signed by the composer where he writes out how performers of the time ornamented his music- and it was to the point that his original line was almost unrecognizable (far more than Rossini's or Donizetti's melodies were ornamented). Mannered? Not this CD, folks."
4,SHE CAN HANDLE HANDEL,"I was surprise to find Renee Fleming covering Handel. In general I equate Handel with a more simplistic style of singing. Fleming adds a lot to these pieces and many times creates a beautiful fullness rather new to the Handel repertoire. I think one this has to do in part by her conscious efforts to stay light and not lean into these songs with the same intensity as she would with her ""Rusalka"" or ""Countess"". At the same time, there are a few pieces specifically the arias from ""Semele"" that while, beautifully phrased just have too much richness for my liking. I prefer Emma Kirby a very underrated singer who has made Handel her specialty and really captures the clarity and sweetness that role begs for. The arias from ""Semele"" are beautiful just the same and the rest of the album is definitely worth listening as Renee Fleming shows that she can handle Handel."
3,"When Renée Fleming sings Handel, you can tell she loves...","... Renée Fleming. This highly anticipated disc starts with a wavering study in tone and dynamics that-if anything-sounds self-conscious and after repeated hearing probably annoying. The quality of the voice, though, is to be marveled at. Grating as ""Oh Sleep, why dost though leave me?"" is, ""Endless pleasure"" is far better-if not yet true to the name. Surprised, given the hype about this disc (NYT) and the unquestionable artistry of Fleming, I waited for supreme joy to come. It never did. The music is glorious, of course, but the singing sounds stretched, tried, shrill even and effortful. In short: the worst example of the usually sublime Renée Fleming that even her fans may not be entirely convinced by. In Handel she lacks the fleet tone of Bartoli or Hunt-Lieberson's natural expressiveness. Try and compare..."
5,The best of the bunch,"I had an other make 42"" plasma good but the Pioneer 50 is much better colors are much better and the picture is also sharper and clearer.I am glad with my choice.Great TV somewhat pricy but if you want better you always have to pay more. Leo-K"
5,Wonderful!,"The delivery service called to schedule a delivery time a day in advance. They assisted in unpacking the unit and making sure there was no damage in shipping. Superb service. I subscribe to HD service through Charter cable. In our area nobyd knew anything about the cable card option so I just settled for them providing me the standard HD set box....which works fine. Charter's website does state if you have a unit that can accept a cable card, the monthly charge is a bit less, but then I also undetand I can't get their channel guide and extra info that the setbox gives. HD is as big a difference as going from a black and white tv to color was in the sixties!The picture and color are magnificent!"
5,Absolute Best Plasma Around!!!,"I researched several models including the Samsung, Philips, Panasonic, and LG. The Pioneer just topped the stats, but you paid at least 1G more. I wasn't sure how the actual performance would be, but the Pio surpassed all expectations (even on broadcasting regular channels...). Pio's TV Guide function works great, along with the way it picks up all channels (even HD) without a box is amazing! I highly recommend it if you have the extra cash, in the long run it's really worth the extra 1G.ShippingI had an awesome experience with Amazon's shipping - it's first class all the way and it's completely insured. They make sure you're happy when it arrives and unpack it too! Highly recommend it.Thanks."
5,Great TV,"I do not have much to add to all the good things other reviewers commented on. I purchased this TV from Amazon two months ago and am still amazed at the overall picture improvement over my previous unit (a 57in SONY rear projection). No regrets at all. Incidentally, I went and got an upscaling/up-converting DVD player, connected it through HDMI and am very satisfied with the result."
1,very disappointed,These are obviously a copy or at very best seconds that were not up to baggallini standards. Baggallini is spelled out in lower case letters but with regular g's instead of their signature lower case with the wiggly g's and their signature a's. There is no registered trademark sign next to the name which further indicates a copy. The squares on the ripstop fabric are all crooked. I have many baggallini products and this is NOT the level of quality that i expect from baggallini. I would rather have paid full price and received a quality product. I am VERY disappointed in BOTH baggallini and Amazon. NOT AS PICTURED
4,Genuine Leather with Large Print would be nicer....,"Pros: These two versions are, in my opinion, the best two English versions of the Bible on the market--the NASB for close attention to the word-for-word aspect of the translation (like the KJV, but in modern English), and the NIV for still unsurpassed clarity without sacrificing accuracy. Having them side by side is a great help.Cons: The text in this edition (and in the hardcover edition) is quite small. If you're under 30 maybe that's no big deal, but for some of us it is an issue. Also, look twice--this is BONDED leather; i.e., leather pieces stuck together with glue, and less valuable, durable, and comfortable to hold than 'genuine' leather."
4,Great study Bible,"I have been wanting a parallel Bible for quite a while. I originally wanted a version that contained the NKJ and NIV. I was never able to find it, but this to me is the next best thing. This is the first NAS I have owned, and I really am enjoying it. My only complaint would be the cover which is bonded leather. It does not have that rich feel to it."
2,Not so great,"I bought this product thinking I would make a one time purchase and have all the necessary gardening tools in one accessible case. However, NONE of the sharp tools, i.e pruners and trimmers, were sharp enough to use. It's all made of cheap plastic and the pieces that go on the top part of the case always fall off. Additionally, I had the trimmers and the ""L"" shape tool break in its first use. And I was doing some light cutting, it's not like I was using it to cut down tree branches or something. To me, this is more like a child's gardening set because it definitely doesn't contain any hardy tools. The only items I use are the little shovels and spray bottle. You definitely get what you pay for, but it would be more worth your while if you spent a little extra on some sturdy, long-lasting tools."
5,PERFECT REPLACEMENT,PURCHASED ON AMAZON FOR OUR COLEMAN TENT TRAILER. IT WAS A PERFECT REPLACEMENT FOR OUR 18 YEAR OLD TRAILER. PERFECT REPLACEMENT. GOOD PRODUCT.
5,excellent product,Perfect solution to an area where space is limited. Craftsmanship appears very good. Used once so far with excellent results. Very satisfied with product.
4,decent product for the price,"we will see how long it holds up.. the last faucet was a hundred bucks.. so for the price of THIS one, I expect it to last half as long -- but I bet it does fine! : )"
5,Perfect replacement,This item is exactly the replacement for my item. So was very pleased with the easy changeover. Done in no time.
5,great thing,"Our camper was built in 1994 and we have used it extensively. When the pump broke, we had no idea if we could replace it. Well, Amazon has everything. We replaced it very quickly and it works great."
4,excellent replacement,Fit perfectly and was able to replace in less than 10 minutes. Item recieved as as described. Great value verus local camping store
4,Useful resource material for coaches.,"A useful resource material for mentors and coaches. The author has valuable 'gems' and useful insight in developing and facilitating people to 'grow' to meet challenges. Put simply, a useful book to have as a reference on motivating people to attain greater heights."
2,Cute but UNCOMFORTABLE!,"These look really cute on and I thought they would be comfortable, but the soles do not bend at all. I've had them a few months so they are broken in. After a few hours my arches ache. Cute but killer!"
2,Ouch!,These shoes are very cute but the straps cut into the tops of my feet. The soles and straps did not have any give. I thought I just had to work them in and they would become comfortable. Unfortunately they didn't and I was literally limping in pain after wearing them one day.
1,Doesn't fit,Beware that this charger does NOT work will all Blade Runner series helicopters. I have the Blade Runner Interceptor R/C from WalMart and the adaptor on this charger was much larger than the adaptor for my helicopter.
1,it is 6V charger NOT 7.5V!!,"universal adapter which is not exclusively made for Micro Mosquito. you can get same similar type adapter on ebay a lot cheaper. Micro Mosquito requires 7.5V adapter, sticker on this one shows 6V although measured with multimeter shows about 9.5V ???? WEIRD!! as soon as I charge my toy couple of times with this adapter I'll write again to tell you how well it actually charges the mosquito and how are the flying times. I'm not happy so far with this product. WAY to expensive."
5,New Burlesque Represents!,"I may be biased, since I appear in this book, but if I weren't proud to be a part of it I wouldn't recommend it!Michelle does a wonderful job of describing the energy and glamour of the New Burlesque scene, with tons of color photographs to emphasize the passion this rediscovered art inspires. While striptease, even retro striptease, is nothing new, the current New Burlesque scene brings it into a fresh environment where the performances take on a new meaning and a new sense of pure joy. Whether you're a fan of girls who make you wriggle or girls who make you giggle, you'll love the performances of the ladies in this book--and the gentlemen, too!"
4,love it,"well, the handle does seem to feel a tad 'lightweight', but it certainly is not lacking quality.very sharp out of the boxlooks greatworks greatdeducted 1 star simply due to how the handle feels, but i'd by this knife again in a split second........so should you....."
4,never ceaes to amaze,this is my second knife of the same model because I lost it at the airport when i was working and i loved it so bad I got another one only this time it wasn't green. other than that the only time I was dissapointed with the knife was when one time the very tip chipped off but this was a very minor chip and didn't affect the performance of the knife by anymeans. The blade stays sharp for ever ever even after a summer of alot of abuse and use this knife held up great. the handle feels good in your hand and have never felt like it would slip out of my hand. the speed safe is always a nice feature never had any problems with it. you get more than you pay for with this knife!
2,Returned this product,"I have always been a fan of Kershaw folders. I purchased this one to replace an earlier model Kershaw knife which ""slipped"" out of my pocket while horseback riding- It was fastened with the clip. This knife, while being of a similar overall length, seemed less substantial than the one I lost. I did not feel I could get an adequate grip on the handle with my (larger than average) hand. Thanks to Amazon.com, for a very customer-oriented and uncomplicated returns process."
4,a good every day knife,"I carry this knife as my daily use knife. I wear it with dress pants and with jeans, and it does not draw attention to itself. I work in a professional environment where carrying a knife would be looked at askance- but this slips into my pocket and is unobtrusive in a way that a knife with more tools on it would not. It is sleek, black, and subtle. Until I take it out to pop open a box or something like that, no one even notices it.The speed stub is reversible, which is good for me as a left hander. What is not reversible is the clip- so when I take it out of my pocket, I still have to flip the knife over. That's the only real draw back of this knife. That would move it from four to five stars if they had just drilled holes on the reverse for me to move the clip.The blade holds a edge, and sharpens up well. The tooth edge I haven't had much use for, but I am glad it is there."
2,Quality Blade...Below Quality Handle,"The reviews seemed good for this knife, so I ordered it. The blade is excellent. But, unfortunately the knife has a poorly designed handle. It's too light of a plastic; I can squeeze the plastic with my hands and it gives sightly. The plastic handle needs to be much thicker to make it quality. If all you intend to do it open boxes, the knife is fine. If you work on a farm or go on adventure hikes or camping; I suggest another knife. I think if the knife was stepped on with work boots the handle would crack. I returned the knife."
2,Kershaw could have done better.,"This is my second Kershaw Ken Onion knife. I also own the tactical blur. I love the blur and wanted a marginally smaller knife of a similar design. Have to say I'm really disapppointed with the black out. The blade is great, just like my other Kershaw but the handle feels like cheap plastic. The blur feels so much better in my hand that there is no comparison. The pocket clip is reversible on the blur, not so on the black out. The blur also has a thumb stud for opening on both sides of the blade so you can open it with either hand. The black out allows you to place the single thumb stud on either side but then you can only open it with your strong hand. The thumb stud itself has a different feel. The blur has a flat side that allows the thumb maximum leverage. The black out thumb stud is round and is harder to push open.Do yourself a favor and pass on this knife. Get a tactical blur. Much nicer and I actually paid less for it."
1,At least I didn't pay money for it,"And you shouldn't either, unless you want a knife with no lock that opens in your pocket and slices the crap out of your finger. This knife was re-gifted to me from someone who said they had no use for it. Even though I am not a big fan of Ken Onion designs, I do like this one. It looks good, locks up solid, and is comfortable in hand.The problem is that the assisted opener sucks! There is absolutely nothing holding it back. I dropped this thing one time on my hardwood floor from about 2 feet and it sprung open. At the time I didn't think much of it until about a week later when I had it in my pocket and it opened. When I get the 4 stitches out there will be a nice 2 centimeter scar on the side of my pinky finger.I destroyed the knife and discarded in the steel hopper at work."
5,Awesome,Just got this bad boy in the mail today uber excited about it. Kershaw makes some real quality blades will definitely be buying some more in the future
5,Excellent little knife,"What do we expect, it is German made. Very sharp little knife, perfect for tomatoes. Love the little protective sheath. Nice size for small hands. Prompt service, pleased with purchase."
5,Wonderful knife!,"This is a very sharp, well designed knife. I use it not only for tomatoes, but many other fruits and vegetables. I like the sheaf it's in and the color red makes it easy to find in the drawer. The price is very reasonable."
4,Pretty darn good!,OMG. How did I ever get by without one of these...the only wish I have is a sharp point to remove the stem.
1,Uncomfortable to use and Sound is awful!,"This phone is going back. We bought it about 4 days ago, and have come to the conclusion, that we'll cuss it everytime we have to use it.<br /><br />The sound is awful. Lots of echo. And no matter how high you turn up the handset volume, you still can't hear the other person in the call clearly. You have to press the handset to your ear, and the poor design of the earpiece is very uncomfortable.<br /><br />Don't let the cheap price fool you, you get what you pay for with this phone. :("
2,Poor Battery/Cheaply Made,"I have owned this phone system for 5 months. The battery began failing on one handset (the mainly used one) after about 3 months. It does not hold a charge very long and constantly needs recharching. The ""Talk"" Button has completely worn off down to the plastic and is no longer readable. The sound is good and have not had reception problems or interference. Mainly I am dissapointed with the battery issue and the build quality."
4,hard rock,aberdeen's suburban is different from it's first release. Variations of rock styles with classic rock influence. Hard rock songs with fast solos. good stuff....dave
1,sucked!,"there was only one song that i was remotely entertained by. percussion can be awesome, but this was not."
4,nice bike,"This bike is a nice bike for the price. It asorbs shocks from the road well, and it picks up speed quickly. It makes a bit of chain noise in speeds 1,2, and 3 but gets quite in later speeds. The handle shifter is easier to use than the thumb shifters are. It shifts smoothly. The one coaster brake is easier to use than when there are two brakes to deal with. The seat is wide and comfortable, well as comfortable as any bike seat can be after a winter of sitting inside. Overall, this is a nice bike for short rides around the neighborhood. I wouldn't want to try it on a long ride as it is heavier than a road bike."
4,Supercute and a great price!,"I bought this bike yesterday as a birthday gift to myself!I was set on finding a cute pink beach cruiser and after shopping around online, I went to a nearby Target store and picked this one out.So far, I love it! At $150, it's a great bike for how much I paid... the mud flap/protector things on the tire are made from a very flimsy metal that I can envision getting many dents in... but like I said, for $150, this bike rocks.The seat is comfy and I love that it has another (altho flimsy) piece of metal that covers the bike chain. I agree with another reviewer that it does make some noise while shifting but that doesn't bother me.I was debating between this model and the Clear Creek Comfort bike but opted for this one based on aesthetics and the bike chain cover. Great bike - I love it! Now I just need a little Hello Kitty license plate and I'm ready to roll....."
2,Happy and Sad,"I was happy with the bike when I 1st got it. But found many little disapponting things wrong with it. I couldn't find saddle baskets that would fit in the end I had the one I bought modified to fit bike (I work at a machine shop so guys here were very helpful with that) 2 months later my brake system broke, took it in to repair and the mechanics in side were broken ($30 to fix), I can not put store bought reflectors on it must modify those. NOW after 8 times of riding it my Handle bars broke, right in the middle of the neck. So even though I work at a machine shop they can't fix that. Maybe it is a lemon. My bike shouldn't have to be in the repair shop so early in its life."
4,"Great for getting around, and CUTE!","Money is tight for me, (as it is for most people in this economy!) so getting a car for college was out of the question. I decided to ask my parents for a bicycle for Christmas; a healthy, efficient alternative to a car.I knew I wanted a vintage-looking bicycle. Upon searching Craigslist and Google, I found that most vintage/vintage-style bikes cost an arm and a leg! I lost hope for finding the perfect bike... but then I saw this bike in a Target ad and was immediately attracted to the fun appearance and LOW price! My parents ended up buying it for me, and I have had a lot of fun riding it.The only flaws I have found with the bike were the size (but I lowered the seat, and it is much better!), weight and paint (it chips easily if rubbed against a sharp edge). I would also like to attach a basket, but the design does not easily allow for that."
2,Huh? What does that say?,"I am a long time fan of these public domain movie collection. So, I am not really expecting restored prints and remastered sound for such a low price. I was very happy to see that most, if not all of the movies in this collection are widescreen. This is a great thing, especially for martial arts movies. I was very unhapy to lean, after going through each of the disks, that more than 1/2 of the movies are subtitled and have no english audio track. This wouldn't normally not bother me, but these subs are hard coded into the movie and appear over the actual picture and not in the black area at the bottom of the screen that most movies use. They are very hard to read. I have bad vision and I find myself having to pause or back the video up just to reread lines that I couldn't see the first time. If not for this, the collection would have been 4 or 5 stars."
3,Philosophically preposterous,"Frankly, I find the central thesis of this book an outrageous nonsense. It's not the grandeur of the Bard that is debatable: it's the very notion that someone, within a brief span of a few years, has undergone innumerable protean personality-transformations and projected them into vivid, flesh-and-blood characters ( true ), and that this feat represents the final dictum and stage in evolutionary ladder of human consciousness ( false ). As I recall, Bloom claimed in his ""The Western Canon"" that Freud was essentially a prosified Shakespeare. Good. But, prosified or not, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche or Jung are worlds quite beyond Shakespeare's reach. If we define ""the human"" as something intimately connected with ""the physical/temporal"", then Bloom is not entirely wrong. But, if ""the human"" encompasses also ""the numinous"", or ""pneumatology"", not just psychology, then Dostoevsky, Hegel or Jung are inhabitants of the universes Shakespeare knows nothing about."
2,Two Shakespeares not necessarily alike in anything,"Imagine if you will two Shakespeares and you have a dinner date with each. One is a pontificating blowhard, in love with his own admittedly formidable fortress-like intellect, convinced that the female ear was made for listening and the female mouth for...well...certainly not expressing her own viewpoint. The other Shakespeare is a delightful companion, full of merry wit, with an intelligence that is at once flexible, sexual, wide-ranging and sinuous. For him the female ear is to be enticed with good humor, good verse, good talk and the female mouth for...well...among many things, engaging with him in stimulating conversation and repartee.The former is to be found in Harold Bloom's Shakespeare: the Invention of the Human. The latter awaits you in Jonathan Bate's The Genius of Shakespeare.A Shakespearean Lover"
2,"Nice Idea, but No Evidence","Bloom posits a number of interesting hypotheses but fails to support any of them with actual evidence. (E.g., Claudius was Hamlet's biological father? Brought up and abandoned within the space of a paragraph. Shakespeare himself wrote the Ur-Hamlet? Bloom firmly believes, as Peter Alexander argues, that this is true. Why? Because he believes it.) Perhaps this is because, as a Yale professor for over fifty years, Bloom has become too accustomed to vast audiences hearing his every word without question. I don't have any justification for this speculation, but, following Bloom's example, I don't need to."
2,"Ultimately, a failure","This book is an interesting read, but it fails in its state aim of establishing Shakespeare as the inventor of ""Western Man"" as we know him. I suspect that this is because the book is based on a very shaky premise. I'd be the first person to acknowledge the contributions of the Bard to thought but I dispute the claim that he invented the modern human personality.My other complaint lies in the fact that Bloom resorts to pedantry and verbiage to present his tenuous ideas. Particularly tiresome are his long expostulations on Hamlet and Falstaff (two of Bloom's favourite characters).The only reason I give this book 2 stars is that it presents a grand overview of Shakespeare's works. It contributes little to our understanding of the human being or literature. I'd just lump this book along with the countless others that indulge in empty and verbose Bardolatory."
5,provocative,"What a romp to read Bloom's take on the Bard and his art and time. This is surely a must for students of all ages. It's hard to further dramatize current affairs but Bloom does make one yearn for a Bardlike voice to comment on the brazen charm gaining kneed worship as it beckons all attend defense into a darkening world where truth has fled with virtuous light. Forgive me, Will."
3,For Serious Shakespeare Lovers,"This literary analysis of Shakespeare's plays is for people deeply into Shakespeare. It is a fine adjunct to the plays but not a short-cut to them. You can enjoy it (whether or not you agree with its sometimes-controversial conclusions) if you are intimately familiar with each play or, as another review suggests, have read the play immediately beforehand. If not, you will understand little and learn less. (If you simply want a one-volume reference to the plays' characters, plots, etc. then get Asimov.) The author is a professor of literature and, like many such, expresses himself in ways that sound good spoken aloud but often seem to come up just short of making sense; decide for yourself. His thesis - that Shakespeare ""invented the human"" - is a stretch but agreeing with it is not essential to appreciating the book."
3,What Bloom needs is an editor,"There are some fine observations about Shakespeare's plays here. But they're almost lost in Bloom's rambling, idiosyncratic, repetitive, and (ultimately) tiresome excesses.The trouble is he's become a ""great man"" and his publishers didn't have the nerve to say, ""Look, Harold, you've already said that five times, don't belabor the point.""The central conceit of ""the invention of the human"" is never explained or justified. But that wouldn't matter if Bloom really provided a useful comment on each of the plays. Alas, too often he doesn't. But he does manage to work in numerous references to Falstaff whether or not Falstaff has anything to do with the play under discussion.I rather enjoyed some of his complaints about academic politics and criticism... the first time I heard them."
3,Accessible and scholarly,"Unlike much literary theory, these essays are accessible to all, and contain many good insights. Bloom's thesis, however, is completely overblown. Shakespeare was a great writer. Certainly. The greatest genius ever to write for the stage. Debatable, but a reasonable claim, to be sure. But inventing human personality? Has he not read his Chaucer?"
3,Bloom is losing steam,"A better, certainly faster read of Bloom""s is RUIN THE SACRED TRUTHS. This new books is a sum of pale Bloomian generalizations. Of course, his recent book on gnosis would make any further addition to his work a vast Improvement. Bloom should get to work and write a book on EMERSON. Now that would be a contribution."
3,Too Much Bloom; Too Much Shakespeare,"Mix feeling between a compliment and a critic. Falstaff and Hamlet as role models of all western literature? And why not Raskolnikov or Don Quixote? What about Yourcenar's Hadrian? The book is a tour-de-force, but sometimes Bloom let us show (hey Harold, we know) how intelligent he is. Like in the Western Cannon, his opinions are more than that, are inequivocal truths. Reading other reviews, the word ""opinionated"" blurts out, like a critic. Why are someones so afraid to listen and learn what other really think? In my country, Argentina (and in Latin cultures) is a must"
1,Tenured Tedium,"With professional academics like Bloom festering in the ivory tower, it's no wonder that the American educational establishment is a bloody ruins."
1,It's up to BLOOM to remind us to read Shakespeare?,"What sort of dolt needs to be reminded to read Shakespeare? Whoever those people are, they aren't the type likely to pick up Bloom's ridiculous tome. His insight, as usual, relies upon overdetermining some paradigm of the Good, attaching it to a text, and then conveniently forgetting that aesthetics, particularly his own, are always political, rather than touchstones to some inevitably capitalized Human truth."
4,Important and self-important,"Bloom's long, rambling discourse on Shakespeare's plays is sometimes insightful, often pompous, and always readable. His self-styled brand of criticism allows him to trumpet huge, occasionally fascinating propositions, without ever REALLY backing them up (except with various paraphrases of ""Isn't this obvious?"")...his title proposition is not the least of these ill-supported theses. He repeats himself to a ludicrous degree (we are afforded the same observations on Hamlet and Falstaff in just about every chapter in the book), and commits himself to writing entire chapters on plays that he seems willing to discard. Still, we feel throughout as if we are in the presence of a great mind and a piercing eye; Bloom's enthusiasm for these works is infectious. And he delivers courageous blows to a variety of pillars that are in need of some major re-evaluation. We have the sense, by the end, that this will stand as a hallmark of Shakespeare criticism for centuries to come."
3,Endless encomiums to Falstaff and Hamlet--and Bloom,"I at first thought of dipping into chapters of individual plays, but then began at the beginning to trky to understand Bloom's total reading of the plays. It was all too evident from the beginning that Falstaff and Hamlet are preeminent and the only characters that Bloom identifies with. His emphasis on ""personality"" makes one realize that the real personality in the overly long book is Bloom, who can say that a critic is ""always right"" which is to say, that critic agrees with me. And when he finally gets to Hamlet he goes on so long and repetitiously that the reader decides to skip over to the next chapter. It seems that he can't resist mentioning falstaff in connection with any of the characters. Having decided that the ur Hamlet was definitely written by a young Shakespeare, he will admit no dissent. There are occasional brilliant insights and memorable lines."
2,An Utter Disappointment,"While Bloom's ideas are quite interesting here, this work is one of the worst studies on Shakespeare period. The reason is simple:Bloom fails to support his ideas or provide evidence. If you want a wonderful analysis of Shakespeare, read Shakespeare After All by Marjorie Garber."
3,Put down the book and see a play,"Although Mr. Bloom writes a wonderful book and formulates the interesting and likely hypothesis that Shakespeare invented the human, we must not forget that Shakespeare was a playwright AND an actor (with an emphasis on the later). For example Mr. Bloom derides ""Two Gentlemen of Verona"" as work lacking any merit at all and I would agree if I only read it, but I have seen wonderful productions of it. Shakespeare wrote for the stage and not for the page. Therefore any book on Shakespeare as literature (like this book) is based on a flawed premise. --- By all means buy the book, read it then put it down and go to your nearest Shakespeare Festival."
1,Stick to Shakespeare himself,"I have read a few positive reviews of this book, and the other amazon.com readers seemed to have liked it as well. I don't think that Bloom outdid himself in this book; in fact it is a travesty of Shakespeare. The basic thesis, that Shakespeare ""invented the human personality"" of course suggests that Professor Bloom and the rest of us somehow are fully human in a way that Dante or Homer or Sophocles or Socrates was not, something that I find difficult to see anyone taking seriously. Professor Bloom is more deeply human than Socrates and Homer, who lived before Shakespeare? The specific readings are awful: for example, Professor Bloom surmises, on what ground I don't know, that Brutus reached out to stab Caesar's ""private parts."" With such interpretations, Bloom is travestying Shakespeare as much as do the scholars who he says form the School of Resentment."
3,More quality control problems,"The technical details regarding this Mac are available for all to read, and there is no reason for me to repeat them. I will only note that this Mac continues my lengthy experience with poor Apple quality control. It came, as did many of this model, with white splotches marring the screen, and the track pad button was so stiff I couldn't consistently hold it down. Both of these probems existed out of the box and the Mac was sent to Apple for repair. Since 1997, all but two Apple hardware products I've purchased -- and there have been many -- have suffered from at least one substantial defect. One small additional note: the keyboard is rather slick; fingers tend to slip while typing. The unpainted keys of my iBook have a better feel."
4,macbook pro,so far so good. just wish apple had changed the actual design of the product a little to differ from the old. so this new laptop looks just like my old one...kind of takes away from showing off something new when it looks exactly the same.great flat screen though...seems sharper than the older version. and the remote control feature is awesome!
4,Great Information!:-),"In my 9th grade global insights class, we saw the movie Cry Freedom, that I thought was boring. But after reading this book I found out how interesting Biko was."
4,dun miss it!,"it's a good n educational book...i think it's really worth reading it.... at 1st...actually i felt boring reading it....but...when the story really reach the excited part, whick biko was dead...it's quite touching... go 4 it...."
3,McNett Gear Aid SilNet Silicone Seam Sealer Tube (1.5 -Ounce),"This stuff is OK but what I have been using and it was an experiment is E6000 Adhesive for crafts, completely blows anything away.I use E6000 for sealing my Tent Seams it works better than anything REI sells (Mcnett) at half the cost and more than doubled the amount, it dries within 15 Minutes and usable within one day because of this I Cary a small tube for EMG sealing on the trail.It's strong sealing is clear and completely flexible!I have had E6000 on my tents for at least six months now and has not damaged the fabric, dried out, pealed, cracked or discolored and still keeping the seams leak free.I will use nothing other than E6000 for tent seam sealing.Recently mended a hole in my netting worked so fast tent was packed within an hour."
2,A Bland Whodunnit,"I was amazed that my primary suspect in the first third of the book was pretty much confirmed midway through, and I kept thinking ""there has to be a twist here, it couldn't be that obvious!"" There was indeed a twist, which I didn't predict, but it didn't shake me from simply revising my theory, which turned out to be correct.There are some love scenes in the book which certainly don't detract from the overall work, but are so briefly written, it makes me think they are written by someone with no more experience than reading Penthouse Forum.All that said, the book is well constructed, with workmanlike pacing and plotting. I think it simply lacks imagination."
1,"Stone Barrington ""light""",Having followed Stone through his past adventures this was a resounding disappointment !! Woods must have called this one in !!!!
3,Weak Ending,"I am an avid audio book listener and this book was good, with a very weak ending. I have noticed that about a lot of books lately. It is like the author spends a lot of time with superfluous narrative and then has to hurry up and end the book.I will listen to Stone again in hopes the novel turns out to be the engrossing mystery I long for."
1,"Mr . Woods, please pack up your computer!","This is probably the worst of the Stuart Woods novels I have read. The characters are sterotypes, the prose is wooden, and the plot comes unglued. Perhaps the worst sin of all is the occasional perfunctory sex scene, dealt with in two lines at most. It's time for this writer to pack up his computer.What amazes me is that this poorly written tripe ends up on the best seller list."
1,Horrid,"Really, horrible says it all. This is only a fun little page-turner if your mind is already mush from years of television, because that's what this is - bad television turned into a book. The characters are automatons who can summon up whatever they want whenever they want with a simple phone call to their people. Not only do they have no depth to them, they have no reality to them at all. The 'sex' is pointless. The writing itself doesn't do anything more than fill the pages. There's only one bad guy in the book, so that takes care of that. I'm still trying to figure out how this got onto my bookshelf. It's not going back up there though - the library sells this stuff by the pound and that's where this one is going. Avoid it - there are too many fine authors available for anyone to bother spending time on this sort of trash. Doesn't even deserve a star."
2,A Fast Read,"The book is a quickie. It's pretty much a fast read & entertaining. Somewhat predictable, I didn't find much in the way of surprises or twists & turns. I thought the ending to be a bit flat"
4,Out of the city,Tense action and plot and a new location made an always interesting character all the more so. It didn't really matter that is was pretty obvious who the baddie was early on - it was a fun ride.
2,Wow - sophomoric at best,"Ugh. Not one to write reviews on books, but I got this as a birthday present, and while I prefer non-fiction, I do like an occasional suspense/thriller read. This was a lousy book - the pace was slow, the plot ridiculous, and the concluding chapters absurd. Very thin plot, and really, really poor writing.I thought perhaps I was wrong in my original judgment, but am glad to see that others think this book is just as lousy as I do. If this was Woods first foray into the genre, he'd probably have to find another job."
2,As bad as it was good,"Have to say I'm conflicted in describing this one. Those who have said Woods is just going through the motions are 100% right. That said, it's an OK read, something to kill some time. Still, I said, ""Huh?"" so many times. Like why does the killer kidnap Holly in the first place? No reason, let alone motive is ever given or even hinted. What was there to gain from snatching her. Oh, yes...it gave the author the opportunity to describe the kidnapper pulling down her pants and putting a bed pan under her. Honestly, describing this as ""emptying her?"" This was too silly to be tittilating, if that was the purpose at all. That whole part of the story was completely ""delete-able."" Contributed absolutely nothing to the plot.It's sad to see that so many of the formerly fine mystery writers have begun to settle for mediocrity. It seems they're not really trying anymore."
1,Dark Harbor,I usually share my books with friends and coworkers.....NOT this one!!! What a waste of time and paper. Stuart Woods has gotten soooo lazy....this is the last book of his I will ever buy and the last of his characters I could care less about. Does Elaine pay him a fee or give him a free meal everytime he mentions her name? Seems most of the reviewers agree with me so I should have read those first.
3,Disappointing,"Woods really dashed this one off. No new characters and he shoehorned in the two love interests just to give them short shrift. The story was okay, but not really well developed."
3,STONE BARRINGTON ** BOOK TWELVE,"If I wasn't such a big fan of this series and Stuart Woods, DARK HARBOR would probably get less than the two ans a half stars I will offer. I think it is my lowest rating of a Woods' book. Can't we get away from the CIA and Lance Cabot and onto new sceanrios?? This one is about Stone's cousin being murdered. Guess what ...he was in the CIA. Holly Barker is dragged through this one too. Its just is slow, guessable, and has too many characters. Far from a favorite."
2,Don't Bother with this one,"Life is too short to be spent reading drivel. Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book. You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better. I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired. I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story. With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books. The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,WHAT ???,"I'm a big Stuart Woods fan but this book was so bad! It holds your interest but the plot is just ridiculous. The conclusion makes no sense at all, so much is left unexplained. It's hard to believe that Stuart Woods even wrote this book. What a let-down."
1,Dreck,"A friend insisted that I read this book. This is the worst book I have ever read in the last 40 years. The writing is mechanical with only a fill-in-the-blanks style. The kidnapping in the center of the book has no connection to the rest of the story and the motive is never explained. There is no attempt to explain the villain's motives for very real evil actions or even to present a state of mind. The only times the author seems excited about what he has written is in his pro-forma descriptions of guns, locks, or airplanes. If you have a friend who asks you to read this trash, cross that person off your friend list."
4,One of Mr. Woods better reads.,I have read each and every one of Stuart Woods books and I have found this to be very well written with the exception that it seemed to end a little too soon. I am looking forward to many more of his thrillers.
2,Need a New Author,"Boy, I sure wish I had consulted these reviews before buying this book, but I was looking for something in a hurry at the drugstore on my way out of town. As a lover of Patricia Cornwell (in her early days), John Grisham, Sue Grafton and Janet Evanovich, I find myself struggling to find new authors who measure up. Woods seems like a good writer, but what the heck was up with the quick and inexplicable finish? This book ended harder than a mob informant into the East River, as they say. I thought the love scenes were contrived and awkward, and there were some parts that just made no sense. Why was Holly kidnapped at all by Caleb- and what did he hit her with? Why was the older man killed and what did he know-? What was the point of the two other dead women supposedly killed during the same weeklong period? Was this book edited at all? Anyway, if there's anybody out there with similar tastes that can recommend a new author to try out, please do so -!!"
1,"Slow, slow, slow.....","This book is horrible.It moves so slow and just drags on forever.Endless babble and driving into town to buy a newspaper, get an ice cream cone, etc.Someone appears to just be trying to fill pages to meet his quota here.Do not waste your time. Skip it."
5,What was Hollywood REALLY like? Read this!!!,"OK---I am taking the trouble to write a review because Where Else are you going to read a story about Ginger Rogers going to another studio to use the bathroom? Where Else are you going to read a story about Joan Crawford seducing a young Jackie Cooper? Or a wonderful, colorful account of a dinner party at San Simeon, complete with what people talked about. Or why ""Over the Rainbow"" almost got left out of The Wizard of Oz. Don't get me wrong--this isn't full of dirt. It is an intelligent, well-balanced view of the people and doings that make show business the true business it is! It is like meeting an old cameraman or other studio worker who ""knew 'em all"" and lived to tell YOU about it. Run, do not walk to the checkout and get a copy of this book today!"
2,Panasonic's reputation got dinged with this phone,"I too am disapointed in this phone. I've always been pleased with Panasonic products, but not this one. For me, the problems are when I'm too close to the base unit, the other party can't understand me. It seems when I'm further away it clears up. How Panasonic can release a phone to the market with this kind of obvious problem is beyond me. I like the features. I like the speakerphone. I like everything else about it, but if it can't do the basic function of talking to a caller, what good is it?My recomendation is to avoid this model completely and hold out for something else."
4,so far so good,I bought this 1 month back ....I works fineI bought another panasonic phone 2 years back .I had to replace battery after 2 years for my old phone
2,"lots of features, terrible voice quality","I hear the other party great, unfortunately they universally tell me they can't understand a word I am saying. I have tried leaving a voicemail message for myself to check it, and it sounds like a really bad cell phone connection. This happens even if I am right next to the base station, and even if I have the clarity booster on. It is not a problem with any of my other cordless phones so it is not a line problem. I have no other 5.8ghz devices in my home, so I doubt it is an interference problem. Instead of simple quality they have loaded the phone with ridiculous data services that no one is every doing to use. Needless to say, tech support is non responsive."
3,"Nice features, but the first one had problems","This phone is easy to setup, has clear sound, and several good features. The address book is easy to use, and the lighted antenna is a good idea. The range is sufficient, not spectacular (about 100ft), and the battery life seems long.However, the first one I brought home sounded great on our end, but everyone I called complained about distorted sound. This problem was particularly bad when I was closer to the base. I returned this phone for a new one, so far I have been happy with the replacement.I would buy this phone again, if I could be assured of avoiding the problems with distorted sound."
4,It works for me!,"After reading some of these reviews, I wasn't sure I'd be keeping this phone. First, I called someone up to see if they could clearly hear me. Check. Then I brought the handset real close to the base, to see if it worked, Check. Then I operated my wireless network to see if it interfered. Check. The phone feels solid in your hand. The speakerphone is in the handset and not the base. The phone uses NiMH batteries much like a cell phone. The display on the handset indicates how much juice it has left, unlike the phone I'm replacing. It's a shame that so many people are having trouble with this model. Must be some compatibility issue with some phone systems but not others?"
1,"Battery died in 6 months, never got the rebate.","I bought the phone and WAS satisfied with its quality even I didn't get the rebate. (Panasonic is famous for its bad rebate) But barely after 6 months, the battery totally died. I here DO NOT recommend this phone and I do not recommend any panasonic products with rebates."
2,Very low earpiece volume,"My 2.4gz panasonic is far superior. This phone would be good IF you could hear when using it! Don't waste your money,it's a dud. Maybe thats why it was only $17.00 after rebates."
3,Poor sound quality,"We've had this phone for over a year now. The features are great, but, over the past 3 months or so, we continually got complaints from parties on the other end that we weren't audible. We were very relieved to replace the phone so we could stop shouting!"
3,Voice Quality Issues,"I absolutely love the features of this phone, but I have to agree that the outgoing voice quality is not good. It is just like others have pointed out: I can hear the other person fine, but he can not hear me (I, too, am frequently asked if I am on a cell phone -- a bad cell phone). It seems that if I am close to the base unit, my voice gets very garbled. That is the only time it seems to have the problem. If I move away from the base, the voice quality clears up. But I must admit this is still the phone I reach for most often when making a call."
2,listening was good but talking bad w/headset,"I tried using this phone with Panasonic headset which were recommended in the product manual. Amplification of microphone with inadequate so I returned phone. The audio (listening) was very good with the headset, but that's only 1/2 the equation."
2,This is an awful telephone,"I am having all kinds of problems with this telephone. Certain features will not work at all, and my ability to carry on a conversation is next to nil because the person on the other end of the line either can't hear me or I break up all the time. No amount of standing near or on top of the base unit helps, and neither does moving the base unit around my home, away from other devices.I am going to ask Amazon or Panasonic for a refund or a replacement with another model."
2,Very disappointed,I read a lot of reviews of cordless phones before I bought my Panasonic KX-TG5050. Wow were they ever wrong.First there's the range. It's awful. I can't get more than 50 feet from the base before the signal dies. I live in the country on 5.5 acres and this phone won't cover 10% of the area. Every other phone I have owned in the past 10 years has covered the area without a single problem. I had a Sony that would get a workable signal over 300 yards away.Then there's the quality. I've owned this phone about two years. It's dead as of today. My last phone (the Sony)lasted about 7 years. It actually didn't quit then. The numbers wore off the keypad so I bought a new phone and gave it to my son to take to college with him. It lasted at least another year after that.The voice quality was ok. The speakerphone was ok. Nothing was exceptional about this phone which is not how it was billed before I bought it.I have lots of Panasonic equipment. I'll never own another one of their phones.
5,garner the greatest,i have followed errol garner from way back in the 50's.he has a great command of the piano and his music goes on forever. i only wish that i could locate the song dreamy that he wrote.
3,Superman Halloween costume,"Well...my son absolutely LOVES the cape, but the costume is way too uncomfortable, the neck comes up to high and is just too restricting, also there is no padding on the inside just the rough plastic from the chest emblem fully exposed."
3,Seams came apart on first wear,"Got this costume for Halloween 2011 for my 4-year-old daughter. First off, it is absolutely adorable, with built-in muscles. The blue is the correct Superman color, but the red is more maroon. The Superman logo on the chest has no backing on the inside, and may be uncomfortable to some, but my daughter didn't mind. She got it a few weeks before Halloween, and had to try it out. The back seams unraveled the first time she wore it, which was disappointing. I had to sew about a 5-inch fix. It was no problem fixing it, but was disappointed I had to do so on a new product."
1,Really??,"This was a waste of money and time. It didn't touch the silicone, and was truly disappointing since I bought 2 tubes."
4,Great Book For Beginner Runners,This is a great book for those just beginning to run or thinking about running. It really goes over one guy's story and philosophy of running. Very inspirational.
5,I HEART John Bingham,"""Whether we accept it or not, the bodies we have are the products of what we have required them to be."" (pg. 45)I really enjoyed reading The Courage to Start. I can relate to many aspects of life John talks about in the book. Every day, I am amazed by how running has changed my body in the last four months. I've lost 35 pounds and I feel better than ever!I was moved by how John mentioned that running helped his relationship with his wife. I've experienced this in my own relationship and I'm so thankful for it.A must-read for people thinking about giving running a shot!"
3,"Good, but repetitive","I looked forward to reading this, because I too feel like a penguin. The book is very encouraging and enthusiastic, but tends to get repetitive very quickly. If you've read the first 3 chapters or so, you might as well stop, because there isn't much new after that. Having said that, I did enjoy it."
5,He was just like you and me. Read it.,"I had just finished Oprah's exercise book and started jogging. But felt stupid when lo and behold, came upon this book at Borders (sorry amazon). If you're fat or slow or afraid to run in public or look foolish, but still desire to get out there and try it. this is the book for you. See also waddleon.com where you can join a whole group of folks who have read John's book and Get Motivated. Good Luck"
5,A must-read for phys-ed teachers,This book should be required reading for all physical education teachers. I wish it had been there for my phys-ed teachers to read when I was a kid.
1,Bikini Top Problems,I have a '99 Wrangler and the TOP does NOT fit. I couldnt even get it to fit with the Bestop 5123801 Windshield Channel. I even a called Amazon to verify I had the right product.
5,Great little gps,This is the best thing sence sliced bread. I love it.Works great and I dont get lost anymore.
4,GREAT GPS,"I have owned and used a Garmin 12 for years. Unfortunately, the Garmin 12 doesn't provide any maps, so I broke down and purchased a Etrex Visa C. All I can say is WOW! What a great GPS. It took a little while to get all the features setup, and to learn how to use all these features. Then it was time for FUN!. If you are looking for a full featured GPS for outdoor use and some vehicle use, you can't go wrong with the Etrex Vista C.Garmin makes wonderful products. However, their Customer Support SUCKS."
2,Poor reception and maps,"I just bought the eTrex Vista C for a NH White Mountains hiking trip. All in all, it was a disappointment. The hike itself was in moderately tree'd areas ranging from 1,600 up to 4,000 ft elevation. It must have lost reception 40 times over a 16 mile hike. In addition, the trials marked on the Garmin topo maps were very inaccurate, sometimes as much as 400 feet off from where I was actually hiking. I called the store where I bought the device and they claimed that was not unusual (after we spent 10 minutes verifying the device was set correctly). It was a sunny and clear two days, so fortunately I didn't need the device to help find or locate a trail. Finally, the battery life was much less than the advertised 20 hours: I'd say more like 15-16 (I guess actual mileage will vary)."
1,What kind of game is Amazon playing?,"I priced this item less than 24 hours ago on Amazon.com. At that time, the unit was $250 with free shipping and sold by Amazon. Today, the item is listed under a third party seller for $10 more, plus an extra $7 for shipping. What kind of junk is Amazon running?"
5,Perfection*****,"I've used a GPS 72, Legend, Vista and now the Vista C. This is by far the best unit I've used. I love the color screen more than I thought I would and the USB cable transfers data very quickly if you want to load maps or a lot of waypoints."
5,A book that actually works for my life!,"I am so excited about this book, it seems like Dr. Rouse really gets that I can't drop everything else in my life to lose 20 pounds! I like the recipes (tropical pina smoothie - yum!) and the idea of looking at myself with ""soft eyes."" The plan is easy to follow and I really feel like I can finally take care of myself AND lose the weight, while still doing everything else I have to do!"
4,I lost 60lbs in 8 months on Nutrisystem,"After success on the Nutrisystem program, but unable to afford it anymore, I bought this book to try to bring the diet into my kitchen. It was not a mistake, but not as helpful as I'd hoped. Kind of a sales pitch for the diet plan, not as many recipes as I'd hoped."
1,The idea behinf the program is good...,"The program is well balanced, however the food is another story. The food they sell is very inconsistent in quality, sometimes thick, sometimes watery. Forein objects found in some of the foods. Mold on someof the food. Good program, terrible quality control."
3,A quick read,"This book was recommended to me by someone who was very enthusiastic about it. I must admit, I was slightly disappointed when it first arrived.This little book was easy to read, but it almost seemed too simplistic to work...but I am willing to try it if the need arises. The concept of the mind and spirit controlling the pain is quite old...so who knows, maybe it will work."
2,Not worth it,"i'm sorry but the game is not that great. The gameplay and graphics are 'SMASH'! Just don't buy it, cause you may resale it."
4,Very useful,A great tool that everyone should have around the house. I've used Memorex brand CDs and DVDs for years and find that they are a good balance between cost durability. I use mine for .iso files mainly and they've never failed.
1,Horrible,"None of the CDs work I have been burning CDs for years never had a problem , I even tried multiple burning softwares the ones I always use, and all of kept saying they were all used ! I use memorex and never have a problem they CDS ARE A SCAM YOU WILL BE BETTER OFF BUYING CDS AT WALMART DO NOT BUY"
1,Not at all happy,"There is something very wrong with thes DVD-R. Over half of them got half way through buring files and then went crazy, refused to burn the rest and then were unusable. Out of two packages I have had to throw away over 90% of them."
4,exactly what i needed,"Delivery was prompt, and the DVD's were in good working order. the cases were a tad flimsy but perfectly serviceable."
1,Video skips,"These disks are terrible! I've tried half of them and upon burning some video onto them, they all skip! I've used Memorex DVD-R before and never had any problems. Disappointed and would not recommend. Missed the return deadline and am now stuck with them."
2,OMG!,"I wasn't happy at all with this item because when I tried to burn movies into this blank DVDs, some of them did not work! I completely wasted about 4 blank DVDs. They did not work properly. I would recommend others to use different DVDs."
4,Works,I have purchased and burned tons of DVDs over the years. I have found problems with several brands. The Memorex seem to have the least amount of errors and result in less discs being unusable. These work well
2,Did not get what I ordered,"So, I ordered this item, you can see that amazon confirms that. The title and picture obviously say DVD-R, but when I got the item, the box said DVD+R and all of the DVD's were DVD+R (not what I ordered). This is not okay, the correct item was not shipped. Even though it was wrong, I still used them and they served the same purpose for me. None of them were bad, all ten worked. It just bothers me that I didn't get what I ordered."
1,DOUBLE TROUBLE,"I thought price was attractive for $7.14 @ a slim pack} { as it came with jewel case too. SO, I ordered two. AS A RESULT I AM OUT $14.28> as NONE WORK...AND THEY WANT TO ADD MORE RETURN FEES TO COMPOUND THE LOSS...WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD A-Z GUARANTEES HERE? NO MORE BARGAIN HUNTING 4 ME, especially with MEMOREX"
1,Rip off,"I sent this product back with a vidio recorder and I was charged with restocking fee,now I am out about $20.00 Ron"
3,Images transferred well,I was burning a homemade movie from my flip video and some pictures. The images came through perfectly but the soundtrack was all off.
5,One-of-a-kind glimpse into the mind of a Waffen-SS officer.,"A point of view never explored in any real depthelsewhere. Were the men of the Waffen-SS Nazi Automatons, blindly following the Fuhrers' everywhim, or were they, after all, human beings withtheir own hopes, dreams and perspectives?Read the autobiography of this SS-man who servedin the (in)famous ""Das Reich"" Division, and make up your own mind.No revisionist stuff here, the author doesn't seemto gloss over any of the ugly details of war on the Eastern Front or life (and death) in theThird Reich."
3,Revised Review,"I am a freelance photographer who loves his Canon photo equipment. I just recently got into Digital photography and of course, bought a Canon PowerShot Pro 90 and love it. I decided to add the Canon Wide Angle, Macro and Telephoto lenses made for the camera. Well the first two were a big hit, but the TC-DC58 was not quite up to speed as the others. The focus was Ok and photos, no matter what I did, were not as sharp but useable. It is very important to go to the Menu and change the setting to 2X Digital when using this lens or the pictures come out terrible. The camera's max 370mm telephoto can take much sharper pictures, so my recommendation is that if you really need to go out to about 520mm and average quality is OK, then this tele converter will do the job."
4,One Eyed Mack is Back,"I read this book because I loved The One Eyed Mack in ""Kick the Can"". I did enjoy ""Crown Oklahoma"" very much, but I must say that it is no ""Kick the Can"".I was particularly intrigued by the story line, and how timely it is today in light of the Jayson Blair and Dan Rather scandals. It is almost as if Mr. Lehrer predicted such events.It was great to be reunited with Mack, Jackie, and ""Leutenant Dad"", and it was a very enjoyable book. I highly recommend that you do not read this until you have read ""Kick the Can"" first."
1,Scratched and cheap looking!!!!,"I ordered this item based on customer's reviews. When I received it, it was scratched, the top piece doesn't fit securely and it was very cheap looking. I would not recommend this item to anyone."
4,Protective Crystal Clear Snap-On Hard Case Cover with Removable Belt Clip,"I bought this for my LG VX8600 cell phone. It works great and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone.Like other people on here, I also would never use the belt clip. So, I took their suggestions and ripped off the button on the back....easy fix."
5,Awesome Texas Band,"I live in Austin where Echoset was originated and live. Every chance, I see them play live, which is such an electrifying experience. They have slamming stage presence that makes people move, jump, or just gawk in reverence.The talent is definently right there in your face when you see them on stage. I enjoy listening to their CD, always reliving the last show. Beth, the lead singer, can move around on the stage with her original body motions while at the same time playing riffs on her guitar and seeming that any time she might trip on her own feet. But she is NOT clumsy, the girl can just make her body move in her own wonderful style. Rae, the bass player is simply great and rocks like big time. Travis the lead guitarist, he's great as well, such is the drummer. I would recommend this CD to anyone out there. You won't regret it."
4,Killing squishy animals has never been such fun!,"Okay, I have never played this game before on N64 or PC, so I'm a ""virgin"" Worms player. With this in mind, this game rocks, especially when up against another human player. There is nothing quite like using a well aimed exploding sheep to blast your best mate's last worm into the drink, where it sinks like stone (because, as everyone knows, worms can't swim). The single player missions are not quite as good, but especially the further you get the more challenging they become. However, the often dead-eye accuracy of the AI shooting a bazooka into a howling gale and sconing your worm dead on the noggin tends to get a bit frustrating, especially when you try the same thing and blast yourself to oblivion. All in all, though, a great game, especially with company."
2,Only buy this if you don't have a PC,"I would have given this one star, but if you don't own a PC, Dreamcast, or N64 and have never played a Worms game before, then this would be a lot of fun.The worst part is choosing weapons. On the PC, choosing your weapon is a two-second process. On the PlayStation it takes between 10 and 20 seconds, because the pointer moves so erratically. Time is carnage.Almost as frustrating is backflipping. That can be a 20-second process, too. On the PC, you press the button twice to backflip. On this game, it can take try after try.Moving the view of the screen, finely adjusting your angle, and selecting the exact position for overhead weapons can take a long time as well.All of these things are very annoying; however, if you have never played this game before you won't know what you are missing, and it will be a lot of fun."
1,Bad version of a great game,"I have been a big fan of the Worms games for years; it is fun, entertaining, and in every way a fantastic game. We just got the Playstation version, thinking that it would be faster than our computer, and it is just HORRIBLE. The game play is basically the same with some bad changes: you can only have 4 worms per team (with the PC version you get up to 8) and you have to choose a sound scheme per game, not per team. The graphics are a major step down from the PC version: several key animations (like the fire explosions from oil cans, the clouds and stuff in the background) are just not there, and the graphics that are there are just pathetic. The graphical quality is so poor that it's almost funny. So by all means get the PC version -in fact, I can't reccomend it enough- but save your money and don't get the Playstation version, because it's just terrible. I am very, very disappointed."
5,Pure gameplay; excellent multiplayer fun!,"Don't listen to the naysayers! This game has some of the best gameplay of any ever. I can't comment on the other versions as I've only played the PS version but man is it fun. No the graffics are not outstanding but they are sufficient and, to me, are as good as they need to be. It's very cartoonish and any fanciness would spoil the experience for me. Anyone who talks bad about the game for lack of machismo is a toolbag and is missing the point. This game is up on top with N64 Golden-Eye as the best mulitplayer in existence."
1,Terrible!,"DO NOT! DO NOT! DO NOT buy this game! If you want to buy it for a system buy it for N64 or the PC. This PSX version is terrible. The worms are super tiny and are very hard to see, the graphics are like atari, you only get 4 players a team instead of the 8 which you get on N64 and PC. If you want to buy it don't blame me when you see how bad it is. The N64 version is madd awesome! You get so much more stuff. Well thats it... Peace Out!"
1,Terrible,"This was one of the worst games i've ever seen.The computer version was perfect but the play station version is a wreck.The graphics are horrible, you can hardly see th worms at all.The gameplay is okay but the makers killed it by taking out all of the cool features.Do not buy this game for the playstation, if your going to buy it,buy it for the computer."
1,"Awesome PC Game Becomes Sad, Disappointing Playstation Game","I just got the Playstation version of Worms: Armageddon. I have a Mac and was running it on VPC but it was just a bit of a hassle, but now I'm going to definitely put it back because the Playstation version is HORRIBLE! Hands down 100% disappointing. First of all, the graphics are reminiscent of the Atari 2600. You know from the PC version that they have already created fantastic graphics- why would they have to downgrade it so enormously? The flowing water at the bottom is a bunch of jagged rectangles fluxuating, the worms are basically smears and the text is cheap and inconsistent. You can only have 4 worms per team instead of 8, and you cant choose a speech mode for them, only an overall one. It is so monstrously disappointing that I'm going to return it immediately."
5,armageddon rocks!,"This is a game that's hard to describe. You control a bunch of worms who try to kill your opponent's worms. The game was given an editor's choice award by Electronic Gaming Monthly in the January 2000 issue. The best part of the game is using ""sheep bombs"" which hop around untill they blow up."
4,NOTICE TO CUSTOMERS INTENDING TO PORT AN EXISTING PHONE NUMBER,"This is not a review of the product or service, but a heads up to those with a current phone service other than AT&T who are planning to port their existing phone number to their new AT&T plan. Despite the helpful link just below the product price offering advice on how to port an existing number to the new AT&T plan (suggesting that your phone and account arrive without a number attached), when Amazon gets around to shipping the phone (it inexplicably took three long weeks for my order), the new AT&T account has already been activated with a new phone number. While AT&T is ultimately willing to drop the new number and port your existing number to the new account, it took me about 15 minutes of ranting and raving to receive this concession. Since Amazon does not make this clear anywhere in their product description or during checkout, please be aware of this."
3,Just the 12 Tapes,"The 12 tapes were helpful for listening and speaking/fluency practice but the book was NOT. I got so confused with the sound representation and symbols because it was Romanized (except for the dialogues starting on each unit.) It could have been better if the Korean words were printed in Han-gul. If you want to practice your reading and/or writing skill, try writing everything in the book in Han-gul or better yet, buy another book that focuses on these areas."
2,disappointing,"i was pumped to get this book..it came in a set with cassettes..but the printing is tiny, the characters run onto one another in some cases, and (according to my korean instructors) the grammar in some sections is outdated...not a great investment for someone who wants to learn the correct construction of characters or current grammatical techniques.."
1,Terrible!,"I was really disappointed with this book. I've been using the Yonsei University books to study Korean and wanted another series to supplement them. I saw the 5-star ratings and ordered this book sight unseen. Boy was I surprised and disappointed when I received it! All the Korean in the book is romanized. As anyone who has ever learned Korean can tell you, it's necessary to learn han-geul, the Korean alphabet at the very beginning of your studies. It only takes about three days to learn han-geul and then you can read everything. To have a whole book, like this one, written in romanized script is ridiculous and tedious. I find it really hard to believe that the U.S. Foreign Service uses this awful series to train its employees, as the advertisement claims. I wish I could get my money back."
2,not worth the money,"the typing is too small, the korean characters are typed in a font which makes recognizing some letters difficult, there is also some outdated grammar shown...suggestion for barron's: find an editor familiar with the korean language! too much money (especially in $CDN)"
5,Excellent Book But Not for Complete Beginners,"There is no such thing as the one best book and audio program. This book has truly great audio content. However, you should start with the Integrated Korean series and use that for at least a year before using this book. The Hangul in this book is very difficult to read because it is a direct copy of a version produced by the US government 40 years ago. By the way, certainly you should start your studies by learning Hangul because it is easy and will help you pronounce much more accurately. This book cannot teach you Hangul. Again, in spite of its shortcomings, this is a great book, if you buy it at the right stage of your Korean learning."
5,This course kicks ass,"Great course-- really worth the money. The 12 tapes are superb-- no annoying narrator babbling in English, or long pauses that you want to fast-forward over after the second time you listen to the tape. Material is dense and challenging, so you won't just finish it really fast and wonder what to do next. The only drawback is that it generally emphasizes formal Korean, although the informal style is covered as well."
5,Very good for beginners,I think this set is really good and systematic. You learn from the basic alphebets to more complex conversation.
3,Fun but too easy,"I am old enough (32) to remember playing the original Space Invaders in the arcade. This updated version was fun while it lasted, but I won the game on the normal level after three tries. The expert level lasted two tries. The hidden maniacal level lasted two tries also. So, after 4 days, I had won the game. That was somewhat disappointing, especially since I'm hardly an arcade shark."
5,one of my all time favorites,have played space invaders for years (from video machines to the old atari model) and was tickled when I discovered this version for use on my computer. Have made it through all the levels and am now getting my grandson in on the fun. He shoots while I move the tank from side to side and he gets a big kick out of hitting an alien (which is getting to be more often).
4,Rather good but much needed.,"First off, you should buy this game because it is cool and addictive. However, it really needs something more. I would suggest they add a feature that allows you to get better weapons along the way. The last reviewer is correct in saying that it is too easy. I beat it in the exact sequence in which he did. I am also not a game shark. Have fun while you can..."
4,Space Invaders,"I really like this game; however, I just ordered it from you about 2 weeks ago and I still never got my game! I was looking foward to playing that game soon! What's going on?"
4,Good and simply put.,"I had to read this for a class and it was better than I thought it would be. Some parts it was hard to understand what they were talking about, so I had to re-read some sections to make sure that I understood."
2,Better than other garbage Bollywood churns out,"I am Indian and am a big fan of movies made by Shyam Benegal, Satyajit Ray, Deepa Mehta, Meera Nair, and their ilk.DDLJ started the entire genre of India Shining movies. Such movies tyically show very rich Indians or Indians settled aborad. In that sense they are completely unrepresentative of Indian society. In short they are shallowness epitomized.Shah Ruck Khan is a horrible actor - he always has the same expression on his face which he had in his first movie 'Darr' . I have a huge crush on Kajol, hence I am giving this movie two stars and not one which is rightly deserves.PS: Music is not bad, but nothing compared to music of R D Burman, or that of movies like Devdas."
2,Better than Bengali garbage,"This movie is pretty good.Thank god its not made by Deepa Mehta or these Bengali lefty ""intellectuals""! I can't stand Shyam Benegal, Satyajit Ray, Deepa Mehta and their ilk.They would have ruined it"
5,Timeless Classic Film!!!,"This film has been playing in India's theaters since it was first released in 1995. I am not from India, but this is one of my favorite films! The story is beautiful! The music, costumes, and scenery are wonderful, too. This film has given me a great respect for India and the culture and traditons there. Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol are absolutely fantastic in their roles. This film is uplifting and I wish everyone around the world could see it."
5,Adorable,"I just enjoy this movie because of the acting, songs, and genuine playfulness of the plot. Kajol and SRK are my Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Hindi style actors. I enjoy romantic, musical comedies and this delivers."
5,All time classic,"This one, hmmm, starts somewhat flamboyantly but progresses brilliantly to end in a manner that lingers long after you've finished watching. It's a great story - kudos to Mr. Aditya Chopra for sure - it held values any one anywhere in the world would respect. SRK and Kajol at one of their all time best."
5,Good Movie for couples to watch and fall in love with,"This movie was a love story with many twists. The main male character was funny, and truly loveable. The combat fighting at the end of the movie was comedic. It was a romantic film but I think males and females will enjoy viewing this film."
4,Excellent buy,"The quality of the product is outstanding and I really enjoyed the movie itself...it's a very good buy...also, the movie was excellent funny at the beginning, but I enjoyed the more serious portions of it...I think that this is one of Shahrukh Khan's better films and I liked the price that I was able to obtain it at..."
1,Deceptive!,"This is NOT a general book to help children overcome the pain of their parents' divorce, but, rather, a book about using Christian faith as a means of coping. Nothing in the book description, author's comment at Amazon, or any of the reviews printed on the back cover of the book allude to this. Makes one wonder why they chose to be so deceptive."
3,Wood lacing sneaker,"Great idea. As advertised. Shipping timely. Child NOT interested in product. He's interested in learning how to tie, but this product did NOT peek his interest at all. Shipping was timeley"
5,Tying Shoelaces,My daughter was engaged with this immediately. She is 5 and I have finally given in to teaching how to tie the shoe laces as her kindergarten teacher said it was a must. She was excited to try immediately and wanted to do it over and over. We didn't even need to use any of the nursery rhymes to do it. The weight of the shoe makes it easier to learn on than a regular shoe and the laces are very long which helps as on a regular shoe the laces are shorter. Was definitely worth the money for a parent who has minimum patience and needed something more interesting than just a regular shoe to interest the child into learning how to tie.
2,not a big deal,"This toy was disappointing.Little kids keep trying to put their foot inside instead of learning how to lace and tie. Because of the way it's made, little kids have the opportunity to hurt their feet by trying to put it on the foot and walk.It is pretty big, great colors, we appreciated the look and feel of the wood, but the design is simply not appropriate.Overall, it makes more sense as a decorative toy up on a shelf in a toddler's room, than as an educational toy."
1,"Seriously, what was I thinking buying this?","If you really want your child to learn to tie his shoes, just stick with a real shoe, like the ones we learned on as children. This thing sat in my daughter's room (and it's quite big and ugly) and she never wanted a thing to do with it. Learning should be genuine and purposeful(i.e. tying their own sneakers so they can go out and play); kids can tell the difference. Also, my littlest one (16 months) kept trying to put this thing on her foot, which looked downright painful (and could be dangerous if she should actually accomplish getting it on). We got rid of it, and you probably will too."
3,Its okay,Its a great idea but its kind of chunky and hard to hold. I have a two year old and a three year old and they keep trying to put their foot in it and it and end up getting stuck and frustrated. I wouldnt purchase this item again. I love Melissa and Doug products but this one still needs some work.
4,not so fun,"the girl I gave it to, didn't take to it very well. Of course it is not as fun as a talking teddy bear. She is 3,5 years old. She may start using it after a while."
4,A classic,I went to this recording at Gethasemane Baptist Church in Cleveland as a teenager. It was a blessed and anointed night.
4,Interesting,"This is not a book that will tell you the specifics of exactly how the genome is being/has been mapped. If that's what you want, get another book. If, however, you are looking for a behind-the-scenes look at the race to crack the genome, this is the book for you. You'll hear stories pertaining to some of the leading scientists in the field. I read it and enjoyed it, but I am a genetics major in college, so I obviously like genetics. I would suggest that you read this only if you are already interested in the subject, otherwise you will be bored."
3,What's in a name?,"For those unfamiliar with the reigns of the Richards, this book provides some useful points of comparison in an accessible way. Those who want to look at any one of the Richards in more detail will need to read other books.The strength of Saul's book is that while it provides observation and interpretation, it allows the reader leeway to form his or her own views.While I'm not convinced that the name alone is a strong enough thread to connect these reigns, I enjoyed the way this was done. Recommended for those 'dipping a toe' into this period of history."
5,Great!,Still using the product without any problems. Works fine. Arrived timely and at a good price as opposed to buying it locally.
5,great deal,"Our family really loves these bars on the go, pre or post workout. They taste awesome!! This is a great price and they arrive promptly. Thanks."
5,"Delicious, nutritious, and no sugar rush","I love these bars. They have a taste similar to that of a Reese's Cup, but without the sugar rush. Delicious! The main ingredient is soy protein. I have been eating them as part of a balanced diet for about a year. Only 240 calories per bar. A wonderful treat with a cup of tea or coffee. Very satisfying."
1,These bars taste really bad compared to Walker Diet bars,"I was very unhappy with the taste of these bars. Walkerdiet.com has low carb bars that taste far superior and have a better nutritional profile. Futher, the Atkins bars have hydrolyzed collagen, basically ground up dead animal parts in them."
2,Sorry I Bought It,"Well, it looks nice, but again as others have said: poor voice quality and static. Also the features are difficult to use and the manual is worthless. I am stuck with this garbage and that is what it is. I am sorry I bought it. I usually avoid Panasonic, and now I really will avoid Panasonic. Stick to anything Sony, and you never go wrong."
1,"Always has LCD problems, bad support by Panasonic","I have had a problem with the LCD screen now twice going out, no Caller ID or ability to set, no words to look at screen, (but is lighting up)...so definitely an electronic problem. Support doesn't speak understandable English, got me wrong part and wont reimburse, and now replacement doesn't work either. Awfully expensive phone for the quality-DONT BUY!!!!"
1,Worst phone ever.,I had many issues from the start. Could not get repairs or replacement from Panasonic. Awful phones.
1,"Lousy Sound, Lousy Call Waiting Caller ID",I returned this phone because the sound quality is so poor. I had to strain to hear even with the Voice Enhancer on. The call waiting caller ID is super slow so the calls would go to voice mail before the number even popped up. The phones are very small which I did not like also. I thought Panasonic would be better.
2,Disappointed,This phone is easy to use but I could barely hear no matter how much I increased the volume. Panasonic is one of my favorite product lines but I was very disappointed with this phone due to hearing problems.
3,Now I have the static/humming problem,"I've owned this phone for about 6 months, and have enjoyed using it until the last month or so. The voice quality of the other person has degraded and is difficult to hear over a loud humming noise on the phone. I have read a reviewer on another site say that they were able to fix this problem by unplugging/replugging the power adapter -- I haven't tried it yet."
1,did i write previous review?,wow...i thought i was about my own phone. i bought this phone locally and am returning it tomorrow for the identical reason ...static and voice fading. at least i know not to exchange for same phone. thanks
1,Horrible,"This phone is a piece of junk. There is static no matter where I place it and It sounds like people are talking under water. I have never had a phone this bad, the problem is I didn't get around to hooking it up for about a month and a half, so now I guess it will make a nice yard sale item."
1,Disappointing Phone,I ordered this phone with high hopes for clear reception and easy use. I was disappointed on both counts. The reception was horrible; no matter what I did I could not get the buzz out of the phone. The buttons were hard to use and the speaker feature was inadequate.I would not recommend this phone to anyone; I have returned it for a full refund and am looking for a replacement.
4,Well done and very enjoyable!,"This is a charming story of the choices people must make. I loved touring the ""enchanted isle"" through the eyes of Alec and Nicole. It's a fun read and very thought provoking as a lot of issues are covered concerning family responsibilities, job issues as well as matters of the heart.Diane Escalera does a fine job telling a beautiful love story and dealing with some important issues at the same time."
4,One of Pickett's greatest record albums.,"I always have to have a kleenex to dry my tears when I listen to this record. When Pickett sings ""I'm Down To My Last Heartbreak"" or ""Give All Your Lovin' Right Now"", It get's me everytime. This is one of those records where you like everything on it except one or two songs. There is a surprise single version of ""It's Too Late"" which is captivating. The re-mastering for stereo leaves a little to be desired, as this CD does not sound quite as crisp as the original Double L record, produced by Lloyd Price. A valiant effort to restore the sound is evident. I never thought I would ever hear these sounds again but here they are. Four stars!!!"
2,For novice game programmers only,"A good introduction to game programming, an okay intruduction to PalmOS programming. Very elementary information on sprites and sound (actually the sound section was better than the graphics). Was expecting a more serious book on game programming, which would describe how to get beyond the API's - something like the Pocket PC game programming book in the same series (which I wholeheartedly recommend for Pocket PC game developers). This ended up being a nice gathering of information that is freely available on the net (for instance, at the PalmOS developer's site, ...). There are also nicer game engines available on the net for PalmOS as well."

2,Save your money,"This book is all things to nobody. Experienced undercovers looking for a couple new tricks will be disappointed by the very basic and general nature of the book. Unfortunately, it's too general even to be of much use to a beginner. All the material is either common sense, a good deal of myth and BS (particularly the section on narcotics), or material written elsewhere. If you want a real guide to working undercover, read Jerry VanCooks' ""Going Undercover."""
5,Praise and Worship from God's Perspective,"Never has there been a greater time than now to help God's people understand what Praise and Worship really means. In a time where entertainment in the church is at an all time high, we often get caught up in the popularity of something without really understanding the meaning behind what we are doing. This book is an excellent tool for educating the saints and the masses on the real meaning of Praise and Worship. Based on sound biblical principals from the Holy Bible, this book is a must have for anyone who wants to learn how to really Praise the Lord and WHY we Praise Him. To God be the Glory!"
5,Unbelievable!,"As a career praise and worship leader, I believe that this book shows an intimacy with God that brings true revelation. It should be a must-read for any worship team or pastor!"
4,A SMALL BOOK WITH A BIG AND POWERFUL MESSAGE!,"THE TRUTH WAS WRITTEN ABOUT PRAISE AMD WORSHIP FROM THE WORD OF TRUTH AND HAS MADE ME FREE! MR TEAL, THANKS FOR BLESSING ME WITH THIS BOOK."
5,Survey supreme,"John Glynn's survey is a bargain @311 pages for [$$] For comprehensiveness, it covers the same ground as D. A. Carson's New Testament Commentary Survey and Tremper Longman's Old Testament Commentary Survey with the added bonus of about a thousand other recommended resources ranging from the American Civil War to Computer Resources. It also features the introduction, ""Building a 'Must-Have' Personal Reference Library"" which narrows down the most essential titles for a pastor's library. Finally, under each commentary section, there is an analysis of what constitutes the best three or four commentaries on each biblical book. For a guide to which purchases one should obtain for a lifetime of ministry, one could hardly do better."
3,Kindle version is the 2003 edition--not the 2007 update,"This is a helpful survey of resources at the top of the charts in 2003. However, there is a 2007 edition in print which renders this edition less useful in the current market. Hopefully the publisher will make the new print edition available for the Kindle in the near future. (Spartanburg, SC)"
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"I picked this up because I enjoy the occasional thriller and the reviews were so good it seemed like a `can't miss'. That expectation soon crumbled in the face of reading the generic prose. It is just so poorly written I could not subject myself to it for much more than a few chapters.The writing was bad enough, but the unfortunate part of the book is the characters. They are cookie cutter caricatures of people I don't think I could ever bring myself to care about. In terms of edge of your seat suspense, it was more an exercise in silliness than anything that could be considered frightening. Very disappointing, indeed.For those who like Dean Koontz, you may get into this.Please take advantage of the `search inside' feature associated with this book before purchasing."
1,Be wary of the Reviews,"The book is not good at all. If you notice, and read carefully, it is apparant that the majority of reviews and listmania recommendations are done by Jack Priest himself, or his freinds. I bought it based on all of the hype when comparing it to Dean Koontz and other thrillers I like, but there is a reason this book has never made a bestseller list."
2,Save your money.,"Both this book and the ""Red"" book mislead readers by listing ""price values"" that are blatently low,-on the very uncommon items listed, even though the pricing errors were brought to both author's attention years ago. Many revisions later, they remain for the most part unchanged.Shame on them."
2,Interesting but implausible,Good story but the plot is too simplistic and falls together in a way that is not believable.The audio book may well have read better if a different reader was used. The reader pauses as if he is trying to figure out a word and the long drawn out aaannnnddd's is very irritating
4,Dreadnought's Curse,It's a great story with well developed characters smooth page turning suspense tale. Hilton has delivered a wonderful revival of a world war story that captivates the reader in the first pages and just pulls you through to the end. We are awaiting his next story.
5,Excellent OBE book,"Sharply contrasting with tons of other OBE books out there, this one is probably the easiest to follow. I enjoyed the diary entries and the bits about clairovoyance and so on. I've found the exercises to be highly effective. So effective that I've actually experienced some extremely odd happenings since reading this book, so strange it all seems a bit too much (no joke). So this is, undoubtedly, as necessity and the methods DO WORK. A must buy."
1,Save your money,"I can sum up this book in one word BORING! Peterson has an amazing talent for describing every little detail of his techniques for getting out of his body. But once out, he goes nowheres and learns nothing. He gives incredibly limited descriptions of the out of body experience. He states that the most significant thing he has learned is that he is a spirit inhabiting a body. Metaphysics 101 is down the hall Mr. Peterson. If you want to learn about OBEs stick to the real experts like Robert Monroe or William Buhlman."
5,Hey! My book is FREE!!,"Wow! Its very cool that Bob Peterson and Charles Tart have written a book together. I feel a kinship with Bob even though I have never met him and never read his books, because both my and his books on OBE were out in cyberspace at about the same time. Charles Tart is, of course, a legend.Anyway, if you want to learn about this stuff and not pay for it, read my book DO_OBE. If you google it you can find a copy."
5,"This Book Got Me Hooked On Books, After 28ys never reading","Wow...what can I say. I never liked to read books, then one day I was drawn to this wonderfully written book ""Out Of Body Experiences"". Full of experiments and meditations to try & practice, this book has chnaged my life, and taken me further to reading the Celesine Prophecy, The Secret Of Shambhala and many many more. Had it not been for Rober Peterson and his amaising book, I would still be in a dark closet never opening my mind to the ""Real"" world out there."
3,One man's journey trying to get an OBE,"Very much a telling of the author's slow learning how to achieve OBEs - have not gotten to the end yet, where hopefully the juicy stuff comes... where we hear what he discovers."
3,OBE experiences,Journal entries and actual descriptions of the author's many OBE experiences and numerous workbook exercises for the reader to try. Many interesting observations about OBEs. Good bibliography at end of book.
5,Great book,"THIS BOOK GOES DIRECTLY TO THE POINT. LIKE OTHER BOOKS, THEY WRITE THEIR EXPERIENCES AND HISTORIES, BUT THIS ONE IS VERY CONSTRUCTIVE AND SIMPLE, AT THE FINAL OF EACH CHAPTER THERE ARE A SERIES OF EASY EXERCISES TO PREPARE YOUR SELF FOR AN OBE, THEY WORK BELIEVE ME.... THANK'S BOB"
2,Ok,"'Out of Body Experiences' book is fairly good. It contains a bunch of neat diary entries and exercises that are easy to follow. It lacks the New Age hype, which is good for some, and is definitely not as dry as other OBE books out there. And the author is pretty encouraging with his experiences.However, this book lacks important information! There is absolutely little, if any, information on negative entities and a host of other things you can find in the astral. But if you just want a bit of info on the astral for starters, this is your book. But I find this one, for me, is not very helpful in the fact all of the info in this book can be found on various webpages (on the robert peterson website, where you can read the entire book), so I just wasted 13 bucks. But if you want serious, highly effective astral experiences enroll in a Gnosticweb course or read an 8 week course on Astral Projection by bezlebuub."
1,RandyTV,MORE OUT OF BODY /OUT OF MIND: I bought this book with a true interest in the subject. I found the experience by this individual to be in my opinion a fabrication of his imagination in most events. No real reference to facts or reference to other books on the subject. To me this was more of a SiFi story full of entertaining trips. Perhaps books by this author are more grounded facts that can explain the truth of the experience.
1,Not convinced it was a genuine experience.,"I was not convinced this was a genuine experience. It sounded like fiction to me. I think many metaphysical & new age book out there are fluff & distracting to the serious material & honest authors. Judge for yourself, but that was my opinion."
5,Very Good,This book covers a lot and includes Diary type entries of the authors experiences. I really enjoyed it. It has lots of great info and its a very interesting and easy read. All of my friends borrowed it and really enjoyed it.
2,I need more explanation,"While the book imparted a lot of information there was not enough, to my liking anyway, on how to achieve an out of body experience. It's way to fuzzy and I was still left with the impression this guy could have just been dreaming. The author states on several occassions he thinks he was having an out of body experience but he is not sure. When he did try to verify the experiences scientifically they all failed. Hmmmmm.... not that it didn't happen I just think maybe someone else should have tried to explain it."
4,Pretty Good!,"I give it four stars only because there isn't as much instruction as I'd have liked, but there is some and it is enough to get you started. He talks a lot about his personal experiences, many of them are fascinating, and his instructions are pretty easy to follow. There are probably better ones out there, but this is definitely a good start."
4,Honest,Refreshing to read such honesty. Helpful and easy to understand the lessons.I would recommend this book to all people wanting to learn or attempt OBE's.
4,Good introductory book,This book written with lot of personal anecdotes is a powerful introduction to OBE subject...the instructions and exercises are useful.The topics could be arranged in a more structured manner for easy reading...that is why I have given only four stars.
4,"Interesting, quite interesting indeed","I'd have to say that by itself, the book is quite entertaining, although after trying the exercises, but not anywhere near enough, I have met with no success. Granted, with time, I'm sure it will come. The only promble I had with this book, was that many of his explinations only left more questions to be answered."
3,Axman,"Wolves [VHS]Soundtrack dates this watchable movie. Main characters are a little overplayed, nevertheless lovers of wilderness escapades might find this worth watching. The rather brutal and gory scenes might be of concern to parents of younger children and I would not describe this movie as representative of the behaviour of Wolves. However, this adds to the plot where those villainous characters ultimately meet a bloody end at the jaws of the Wolf, suggesting some sense of a 'primeval' redemption, true only in the darkest fears of Man."
3,Investment Policy??,"The book talks about Investment Policy but provides no examples of such. There is mention of stocks vs bonds vs money market, but only a mention. I agree with all the investment caveats that are mentioned and they are instructive. But there is little to guide me in creating and managing my portfolio. The other authors: Jan R. Squires and John L. Maginn are nowhere to be found. Did I purchase the correct book?"
5,How to Win The Loser's Game,"This short book from investing guru Charles Ellis is a gem. For readers who like clearly explained investment advice, this book will win you over. He writes in simple, easy to understand language for those new to investing as well as seasoned investors. Have you ever tried to beat the market? Ellis will educate you! As you read the book you'll ask yourself how you ever got along without Charles Ellis's sage investment wisdom. It's so simple, yet incredibly powerful."
5,Wonderful Intermediate to Advanced Workout DVD,"I loved, loved, loved this DVD. It was engaging enough that I rarely got bored (hard to do), yet left me sore the next day. I'd strongly recommend it to anyone who wants a ""ballet style"" workout that they can do at home."
3,Mixed feelings,"A have mix feelings for this workout. This is my first attempt at the barre and while I was doing it I did not enjoy it. I usually do high intensity cardio and cardio sculpt workouts, and/or the elliptical machine four to five times a week, hence I am not used to most of the movements. Besides the fact that it tends to be repetitive, some of the exercises are a bit too hard and not enough instructions on modification or proper form are given.However, after finishing it, I felt good, and after a few days I wanted to give it another try. Still dont enjoy it, but I do feel the work."
1,Be careful,"I am a reasonably fit person. I do exercise videos by Chris Freytag, Phsique 57, P90x, etc. I injured my back and neck doing this video and haven't been able to work out for over a week. I'm a physical therapist and understand the body and the importance of good form. This video moves too quickly and doesn't offer many modifications. I think it might also have happened because I was trying to watch her and do the moves which , as I said, move along a little too quickly. I recommend Physique 57 for this type of exercise."
5,My favorite Barre workout,"I've tried all the major barre videos and even studios, and by a long shot ... Tracey Mallett's Booty Barre is my favorite. I am a distance runner, and have never had any dance in my life, but Tracey's cues are consistent and descriptive so even I can do them with ease after the first time through. This workout is challenging to the fittest but the modifications enable anyone to do this workout and face the challenge of building.Thank you Booty Barre and Tracey Mallett for a great home workout!"
3,"Eh, okay....","Absolutely not my favorite workout, however I have zero dance experience and a lot of the moves were just too odd for me, I have yet to actually completely the entire workout for two reasons - 1. I get bored because it's not as fast paced as I prefer and 2. the moves are too difficult for someone without a dance background. With that said, the workouts that I have done were difficult and I definitely felt the burn while I was doing them, but was not sore the next day. It's also really long, like an hour and 20 minutes long, and with two kids, I don't have that kind of time. Maybe an hour, max, and that's on a weekend when my husband is home. So, would I recommend this....not really....but then again each to their own. I'll probably throw it into the mix a few more times to see if it grows on me, but thus far, definitely not my top purchase and I'll probably pass along to my sister who is into the ""dance"" workouts."
4,Good cover,"This is a nice cover for cloth diapers. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the fabric is somewhat bulky. There are thinner ones on the market--try Thirsties, which come in colors and are just as nice and in the same price range."
5,One of our fave diaper wraps,We have several different brands we use (helps fill in when she's in between sizes) and the bummis are definitely one we'll stick with. They fit my baby's fat thighs and (usually) keep the big poops in. They also bleach better when we need to run a bleach load to spruce things up a bit.
3,Not super impressed,"With a newborn I think everything is trial in error, but I have found these covers to ""leak"" often. When they are wet around the legs they seep onto the cloths. As he gets bigger it happens less, and I'm sure it has to do with the diaper I am using, but I feel the cover should contain more moisture. I feel it's an alright product for the price."
3,Body Painting Kit,"This kit includes small paints, transfers and a 'how to' book. The areas of the book include, getting started, stencil motifs, tattoo transfers, freehand decorations, and the use of ink and crayon. The body art displayed covers small areas of the body, such as, the face, eyes, belly button, shoulder, ankle, etc."
5,Very good,"The presentation of the different parts of the muslim world and the meeting of the people from there, to go to Meca, makes this movie fantastic."
3,"Started out promising, but...","The video started out very promising, with beautiful images n compelling interviews. However, perhaps due to the time constraints (just 1 hour), it began to feel rushed n turned out a little anticlimatic in the end.I think the concept was good, but the video tried to achieve too much - talking about the 5 pillars of islam, introducing us to 6 pilgrims n bringing us to 7 different mosques around the world and explaining the historical significance of each. In the end, however, the video felt a little choppy, n the audience wasnt able to properly connect w the characters enough to lead to the climatic moment of reaching the ka'aba. I think, had the video been 2 hours long, it could have achieved all the ambitious objectives it had set for itself. But as matters stand, apart from the gorgeous images, it fell short."
5,I had the chicken and dumplings,"I went to Shields Tavern and had the chicken and dumplings, it was the best I had ever had, so I had to have the recipe, I order the cookbook and I love it."
3,good bio with some misgiving,"First off, I didn't receive the A&E; DVD shown. I was sent a cheap DVD-R knock-off from someplace called ""Bio.com."" Have complained to Amazon. We'll see what they do.Second, being a Patton admirer even before the movie with Scott came out, this was an excellent bio of a great leader. Where it falls down are in the use of poor quality films of the World War 1 period plus some idiot throughout reads Patton's quotes with a gravelly voice that is a very poor impersonation.Let's hope someday A&E; or the History Channel remake this tribute to the best American leader of the war with more than cheap, washed out film and a better reader."
5,Excellent Read!,"Gerasimou creates vivid characters with real emotions and problems. This is a great book for Christians and non-Christians alike, as all people struggle with similiar thoughts and questions. The dialogue is believable and fast paced, making for a fast, enjoyable read."
4,For Cash fans only,If you collect Elvis on DVD. Then you better pas on this one. I've seen better picture quality on other releases. But for Cash fans there are great performances to see. But if you've got the DVD from the old TV shows: At Town Hall party. Then you've got the most of what is on this one. Only the other rare TV show clips are great to see. Only for the real Cash fans and if you can get is cheap.
3,CASH AND PRESLEY,"A NICE COMPILATION OF VIDEO CLIPS FROM JOHNNY CASH.DITTO ELVIS CLIPS,BUT THE VIDEO QUALITY ON THEELVIS CLIPS IS INFERIOR.OTHERWISE,WELL DONECOMPILATION."
4,A Fresh Face For A Fresh NEW Sound,"Charity invests alot of passion in this album. She reminded me alot of a cross between a younger sweeter sounding Sheryl Crow to the sounds of Garbage, No Doubt and Sarah McLachlan. To say the least I was very impressed to the core with her musical presence and varied styles presented on the CD. It seems like everything is covered here from piano tunes to harder mainstream rock fare. In my opinion if Charity doesn't become a star then radio has a deaf ear."
2,Gordon Korman is running out of ideas,"While there are a few inspired moments in this Gordon Korman book, it doesn't come close to his masterpieces such as The War with Mr. Wizzle, I Want to Go Home! or Who is Bugs Potter? While Korman can write for younger readers, this story doesn't have the necessary flair to keep even the most beginning reader's attention. Very predictable and lacking the creative humor of Korman's other works."
4,"Nice, but missing stones","The product is nice and my son is happy to have it. It came in the mail within the time frame stated and was packaged nicely. The only concern is the fact that there are about 20 missing clear stones ""diamonds"" on the belt. Now I have to try and find someone who can send me more to glue back on. It did come with extra stones, but not nearly enough. I need 22 clear stones."
1,Not made of real gold,"If you buy this, then you must be a retard. Why not save the 225.00 to buy a handgun to end your life, you piece of trash."
2,chilton's repair manual:nissanpickup 89-96,"if you cannot wait 4 wks for delivery,you could try your library until yours arrives"
1,W 30 GB skin is too big for the unit,the product arrived and it said for W 30GB but when I put it on my unit it was too big so I sent it back to the seller for exchange and up to now I never heard a reply so I don't know what's going on.
4,The prefect second PL/SQL book,"This is a great book to test your PL/SQL knowledge no matter what level you are at. In fact each chapter is devided into 3 sections: Beginner, Intermediate and Expert. This is an excellent book to get after you have worked through a PL/SQL course and want something to give you the extra edge on all the various PL/SQL topics. There is some very good hard to find information in here."
5,Great Book with Helpful Learning Exercises,"I thought this book was great. If you like getting into specific, real-world programming tasks and figuring out the best solutions then this book is for you. He provides helpful explainations along with his solutions. There are a lot of top-notch, practical techniques that you learn as you get into the nitty-gritty of working on small pieces of pl/sql code. There are also questions that test your conceptual understanding of different facets of pl/sql programming --- questions that you could face on a job interview. Even though I've been a pl/sql developer for a few years, I found this book very useful."
3,Format is that of one large Quiz,This book covers a wide range of material. In this sense it is good for someone of every level but it also means you will only use a part of the book. Each chapter is structured like a quiz - answer the questions and then review the answers. It does not work you through problems but there is a lot of useful material in here that you will not find anywhere else.
4,Industrial user,These Jet screwdrivers are a good value.Only thing missing is a padded handle grip.... they tend to be Cold.
1,I can't believe it,I can't believe that Amazon expects anyone to spend 38 dollars on a video with such a lousy incomplete description
3,Johanna 5 Stars Sound engineer 0,"I LOVE JOHANNA GRUSSNER! Her voice is great, her arrangements are tops, her style is superb; but on this album her sound mix is awful. The sound men made the mistake of thinking her sidemen (who are only so-so) are as important as she. They are not.Johnanna's name is the only name on the album, and it is deservedly above the title. But this album is mixed so badly that the instruments are most of the time as loud/louder than the singer. Unfortunately, I have heard this mistake made so many times, and it sickens me every time I encounter it. Another thing, she doesn't sing enough on the cuts vis a vis her sidemen. I hope that this wasn't her fault.It seems Ms. Grussner has been mistreated by her engineers, and by her sidemen. I hope she did not have final say on the mix. I would love to hear this album properly mixed and re-released that way. She deserves to be completely front and center on this, and on all her albums."
2,Not really jazz,"This was the first time I heard Johanna Grüssner. Nice voice and talented, but while she sings jazz standards (and some pop) she is not really a jazz singer in terms of improvisation and individual expression, even when just singing the head the second time around - it's the same material. Little originality - It's more like a cover or wedding singer. If you want more jazz go for people like Jane Monheit or the masters like Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, Carmen McRae, Nancy Wilson, Jimmy Scott, Shirley Horn, Billie Holiday . . ."
5,Don't get rid of your beloved Mac,"All the printers currently on the market have dsl or parallel port connectors. PowerPoint allows you to hook a serial port (the round Mac printer connection) to any printer. I use PowerPoint to connect my old Power Mac to a brand new (HP 900C series) printer. It works beautifully with all my programs (wordprocessing, internet, pdf files, photos, etc) and even accomodates various layout settings. It is extremely easy to install. You just attach the enclosed cable and pick out your printer from the list on the CD. Also I have found this a good company to deal with for support and upgrades."
3,Be Aware,"I bought the e-trex Legend C and have only used it for driving to and from different locations in my work truck. I work at new neighborhoods alot. You have to use a recent map if you don't update your software. Garmin stated that they are not providing updates any longer for the Legend C. So if you buy anything, buy the Legend CX or something else. I have City Select. Maybe another program is better."
4,Depends on what you use it for.,"I am comparing this to my old etrex Venture. This is not a mapping grade GPS, meaning that there is no NMEA output. Typically, this does not mean a dang thing to the typical user. If you are a bicycling, hiker, fisherman,hunter, then this will be a great choice. The display is easy to read. Right now I am sitting in my house with the unit plugged into the computer (which uses the computers battery source) and I have 6 satellites. There was no way I could have used the older models indoors. In other words, the satellite reception is great. For the money, it may be worth choosing a different model, as this one is now discontinued. Makes me wonder if that is a sign from Garmin??"
2,etrex Legend C GARMIN,"Being new to GPS for GEOCACHING. I find this unit very hard to use following the instructions in the user manual.This is not FUN !!!THUMBS DOWNI am 63 a retired Firefighter IAFF LOCAL 788 Camden, NJ"
4,everything I expected,"Everyone probably knows the positive sides of this GPS unit. The few negative sides I experienced were:1) unit sometimes shuts off when used on a motorcycle (perhaps vibration causes batteries to lose contact)2) hard to press ""enter"" button, especially in riding gloves.I also highly recommend RAM gps mounts.===Edited after a few months of use===3) I solved the shutoff problem by using a 12V cigarette lighter adapter.4) To anyone who considers this model I would recommend looking at gps receivers by Lowrance. I had a chance to test Lowrance iFinder Expedition Color and I was very impressed with its usability and features."
5,A 'must read' for pet owners,"A friend sent me the Plechner book, ""Pets At Risk"". It went with me on vacation to Puerto Rico, where I read it cover to cover. There I was by the pool, reading avidly about canine endocrine disorders.This is an absolutely enthralling read for anyone who cares about their pets' health. Vets have significantly improved their abilities to diagnose diseases, but are still grappling with treating the result versus treating the underlying cause. As an owner who has dealt with issues ranging from cancer to skin allergies to Addison's disease, I found Dr. Plechner's observations and insights providing ""Aha!"" moments.I've already ordered books for each of my vets, in order to discuss whether this treatment could work with some long-term issues in some of our pets."
5,Excellent book-has helped my dog !!!,"I loved this book. Vet (Dr. Churchill - Atlanta, GA) shared it with me. We took blood test of my dog only to find she was not in the normal range. We raised all her levels (cortizone and thyroid) and she is doing great. No more itching, allergies. She eats Royal Canine hypo-allergy and takes meds. Much better than going thru symptoms every 3 months and just getting a steroid shot !! Her coat is even coming in more and she looks healthly. Go get the book and share it with your vet !!! Good luck. Karen and Dominique"
4,Flatt & Scruggs DVD #10,"I ordered both #9 and #10, #10 wouldn't play on my dvd player for some reason but it would play on my laptop. But just watching Flatt&Scruggs (especially Earl Scruggs), is always incredible."
3,not what I was looking for,I was kind of disappointed in this book.I thought the title was misleading.I was looking for a book that would help people who had been hurt by other Christians to recover. The preview chapter gave that impression.But it more a book about how badly Christians behave and the impressions they give to society by their behavior.
3,"Well-Intentioned, But...","""When Bad Christians Happen To Good People"" makes many excellent points - that Christians need to be a part of the world and not cloistered, that how we convey our message is as important as the message itself, and that we need to focus on grace more than militancy. I understand his choice to use a casual, conversational tone for the sake of accessability, but on occasion he came across as flippant about rather important subject matter.Unfortunately, Burchett loses all credibility when he feebly attempts to derive Christian lessons from the 2000 US Presidential election fiasco. His inaccurate and incomplete recounting of events leads him into the same trap that he (rightly) accuses other Christians of falling into - just as some take Bible quotations out of context or become very selective about which parts of the Bible they choose to follow, he similarly recounts selective events while losing sight of the Big Picture."
3,Great book in parts...but not as a whole,i really related to alot in this bookand also didnt relate at all to some of the pointsas a whole its gooddissapointing in that i felt like i had to go alongand admit i was guilty of stuff i wasntlike we all have been therewhen i actually hadntso i skipped over thata good readbut no need to read all of itor pretend to relate to any of it if you dontif you dogreatfunny at timesothersnot so muchoverall i am happy i got the booknot just happy with the book as a whole
1,The title of this book is deceptive.,"The title of this book gave me the impression that there would be more real life examples...but the majority of this book consists of lecturing on how ""the Church"" seems to be, and how he thinks it should look like.The author doesn't address the main issue enough.The book isn't relevant to those he calls ""unchurched.""And his writing style and analogies are a bit too simplistic.This book did not help me at all. Two thumbs down."
5,A Must-Read for All Christians,"Just what is the problem with Christians? Why are some Christians and non-Christians so turned off by religion? Dave Burchett spells it all out for you in direct terms.Christians are their own worst enemies. From not catering to those who did not grow up in the church (and do not know the lingo) to those who have a conflicting view and are attacked for it. It is really no wonder why many choose to be ""spiritual"" rather than ""religious"". To be religious now often has a negative connotation. Sad. Honestly, I can relate. I continue to attend church because of my children, but I have experienced the mean Christian attack dogs that fill each and every church.This book is easy to read. It is short, and it is enjoyable. This is a must-read for those Christians who are genuine in their faith. It is the best Christian non-fiction book I have read."
1,The Last Star at Dawn,"Unbilivebly horrible conclusion to a grea trilogy! The begining starts a bit strangely but it starts to get good. In the middle of this book i thought that it was going to turn out just as well as the others. But soon to my astonishment it started to get worse and worse and worse and worse and so on and so forth. It looks like it will be a good ending when one of the main cherecters dies, the Baron dies, all of the worm suddenly die and Lord Faran dies in a way that he could have gotten out of after living through so many unescapeable traps. Not only that but Urthred is blinde and Oliver Johnson loeses his touch for great description and good writing!READ THIS BOOK AT YOUR OWN RISK!"
4,Listen to the sound bites!,"This is one of those rare instances where I listened to a sound clip or two, then ordered the CD. Love it...the songwriting is great, and for a country CD, this album rocks! Listen to those clips and I would wager that you might feel the same way!"
4,Loving Evangeline,"I have always loved Linda Howard. She is a wonderful author and her books always interest me. This one in particular caught my attention because I live in the town in which it is set. Linda Howard describes my town wonderfully and does not make it out to be a ""hick town,"" which it has been called. She catches the beauty of the lake and the sense of the town excellently and, even though it is not one of her best, I enjoyed seeing my home through another's eyes. It is descriptive and accurate, and I would like to thank her for choosing Guntersville as the setting for her novel."
5,One of her best,"This book and ""After the Night"" are my two favorite Linda Howard novels. The Unabridged ""After the Night"" was recently released on [...]. Now if we could just get an Unabridged audio of ""Loving Evangeline"".... I live in hope."
3,Enjoyable,It is a little predictable but her determination is great and adds to the book. I did enjoy reading it
5,Highly rated. Well written,I really enjoyed this book I could not put it down it was so romantic and suspenseful at the same time.
5,"Great book, sucky movie","I looooved Duncan's Bride, and so was happy to read dear Robert's story. In case you feel tempted to hunt down the TV-movie: DON'T! It is nothing like the book. I seriously hope that if Ms. Howard allows any other of her books to be made into movies, she gets the movie to actually resemble the book. The plot was changed, the characters were changed, ugh, the has-been actors sucked..... you get my drift. The book, however, ROCKED. Sweet, innocent Evie is someone who will not accept the scraps of affection Robert wants to throw at her. She wants it all, and boy, does she get her wish."
1,Alpha hero goes way too far,"A topic in the Romance Forum brought this book to mind and I looked it up again. I still hated it as much as I did the first time I read it. Robert is a hero in the loosest sense of the word. He's domineering and manipulative and does horrible things to the heroine, Evie, who is resilient in life, but lacks a backbone when it comes to him.Even the ending is less than an HEA in my mind. Robert is still all about domination and control and not about love. There's no giving in him, it is all about taking from her.Such a disappointment after Duncan's Bride, which I loved."
2,I did not like this book,I tried to like it. I kept reading hoping it would get better. Sometimes I'd get to a good part. After a while I decided to stop wasting my time and delete it.
4,Loving Evangeline,"I thought this was a good story. Linda Howard writes good, strong male characters, even if they are over the top, but hey they are stories, so why not? Evie (dumb name) was a good character. A hard-working Southern woman who owns a marina/boat rental service. Robert Cannon is a rich tycoon trying to find out who is selling company secrets.The whole espionage theme was really weak because the story was more aboutRobert's pursuit of Evie. His interest in the espionage was sort of after the fact and you didn't care about it one way or the other.At any rate, it was an enjoyable read, but then again, I usually like Linda Howard."
3,lots of detail but hard to navigate,"This book is chock full of details, with history and facts impressively presented for sights throughout the Czech Republic and Slovakia, places small and large. The dense pages are hard to navigate as they are formatted, making it difficult to find information quickly. Also, the author seems to have traveled by car and the book lacks practical information on public transportation, such as how long it takes to travel from one place to another and how much bus or train tickets cost. This book will provide you with great background information once you are already there, but for practical trip planning, I found I needed to refer to the Lonely Planet."
1,Not A Good Product!,"I just gotten this product and I'm not satisfied with it. It doesn't have a good reception to all the channels. I'm sending this product back and I'm going to try Lilliput 8"". I saw the reviews on the Lilliput 8"" saying it's a good product."
1,no good for regular over the air reception,"I purchased on of these sets from another store. I could not receive anything using the attached antenna. Exchanged for a new one, the same results. Returned for a refund and the lady doing the refund for me commented that many have been returned. I live in White Plains, N.Y. about 10 or so air miles from most of the big Manhattan stations. If you can't make it their you can't make it anywhere. My 20+ year old Sony handheld Watchman TV does OK under the same conditions. Save your money and look for a better unit."
1,Dead after only 4 months,"This TV was OK while it lasted, but at just under 4 months the screen went completely dead. Coby said the warranty is only 90 days and they will not do anything for me. Pay a little more and get a quality brand."
3,You didn't really expect HDTV in a portable,"Screen not as sharp as one would like. Reception mediocre, color balance so-so. Device gets warm easily. But small in size and not too expensive."
2,"Poor antenna, otherwise it's a nice product","I suspected the TV was damaged, so I tested the device with the cable TV antenna and the image was nice, and good sound. Then I unplugged the antenna and things changed. You must turn the antenna to find signal and have an acceptable image and sound every time you change the TV channel. I recommend an external portable TV antenna with signal amplifier to have better results. If you find one, please let me know because at this point i cannot return the product."
1,coby tv,"It was a nice size tv, but there was no fine tuning. the color was bright but what good is it if you cant get a clear picture. I returned the product."
2,New version available in UK,This version is now redundant as Vanguard has released a version in 2005 with the original album cover for the first time and with new sleeve notes. The sound is also better. I purchased it from amazon.co.uk.
3,"Lots of good information, needed an editor","I got the feeling as I read this book, which I highly anticipated because of the great reviews, that it was written with thesaurus in hand. I found the incredible, awesome, inexplicable use of superlatives to be distracting. The book was chock full of good information (circa ten years ago) of the places that were visited. The early promise of introspection following the loss of his son, I felt was relegated to the back burner and the occasional line at the end of a chapter that the author was learning to leave the past behind, but not forgotten. I enjoyed the book but do not feel it worthy of 5 stars like the other reviewers."
5,Riding the waves...,"A treat read at the end of each day.Imagine Rick Steves channels Hemingway with a Jimmy Buffet soundtrack. Much more than just another sailing story; a captivating journey and a ""must read"" for any sailor who dreams of ""the big cruise."" Moreover, a lesson for the rest of us landlubbers on the big cruise of life as we learn to roll with the waves we see coming, or recover from the ones we don't."
4,High Energy Cookbook,Good explanation of low glycemic diet. Recipes are not that great but the explanation of the type of diet is good.
3,great gift,"I received this as a gift many years ago. Only recently have I started to make the recipes. There are many really healthy and tasty recipes that don't disappoint. I am giving it 3 stars, because there are just not enough recipes. I came online to see if there was an expanded version or a volume II."
4,They started it all,Some of the reditions are stilted and do not have the polish of subsequent arrangements. But it is a pleasure to hear how some standard folk classics sounded before all the hooplah.
4,Get this CD with Vol. 2 (5 stars) and you won't be disappointed,"I listened to the Carnegie Hall Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 LPs as a child and was not disappointed in these recordings as CDs. Vol. 1 has a more ""folk music-y"" flavor, no doubt from the influence of Pete Seeger, who tends to channel ""pure"" folk music in all its variants, from raw to rollicking. Vol. 2 songs are more typically melodic in their arrangements, although still definitely folk, and feature the musically interesting, husky yet pleasing voice of Eric Darling, with amazingly high-quality sound."
5,A classic,"This is a classic from a bygone era. The playlist and the sound are impeccable. Shipped and arived quickly. Price was great.I'm a "" happy camper "" once again. Thank you Amazon and sellers."
5,Great Album (nothing here to be red-scared of),"The Weavers at Carnegie Hall: Recorded live on the day before Christmas in 1955 and this recording still holds up as the foremost example of group folk singing. The influence this album had on the folk groups that came along in the 1960's is undeniable. The 1950's `Red Scare' put an end to this wonderful group just when it was about to become the biggest group in the country, which is odd because this recording is as non-political as any Folk performance will ever be again. Highly recommended."
5,great show,"The Weavers are a great group of folk singers, sibnging a fine selection of songs. I particularly like Pete Seeger's banjo playing and the singing of the group individually and as a group."
2,The Weavers,"I was already acquainted with this album as a child and was delighted to see it was still available. An ""oldie but a goodie""."
3,So-so,"I think this is a case of ""you had to be there"". If you remember the Weavers, and remember the influence they weilded, and remember them being blacklisted during the McCarthy era, you'll probably impose a lot of memories onto this average quality recording and enjoy it immensely. I don't remember any of that. I grew up when folk music was popular, not a dangerous political statement, so this just seemed like any other recording of people singing folk songs. I forget how much it cost, but I definitely got my money's worth."
5,Cool,This cd was a gift for my sister and her baby. They love this cd and is perfect for the baby to go to sleep!
1,Big disappointment,"You'll like this CD only if you like the tin can sound of Baby Einstein. My husband and I love Coldplay; this CD is NO introduction to good rock music. We'll just play the real stuff for our kids, thanks."
5,just as listed,The product came just as described. Still wrapped in original packaging and shipped quickly. Gave as a gift with rave reviews!
3,Not the best Lullaby Rendention CD,"We have two pre-elementary aged children in the house and regularly have to switch to mind-numbing kids music. We hoped that this CD would give us a chance to hear non-kid music without offending any little ears. The music was passable, but not great. The real Coldplay CD is much better."
4,Very nice music,This is a very relaxing album. Nickel Creek is a Bluegrass group whose melodies are soothing and a delight for all who like bluegrass.
4,Great album - sound quality not as much.,"Anyone who loves Nickel Creek will undoubtedly love this album. I listen to it on a regular basis and love it more and more each time. The only complaint I have about it is the sound quality. I catch myself constantly maxing the volume out and still not hearing it at the level I'd like. It just isn't meant to be a ""rock out"" album, I suppose."
3,"Not bad, but not exceptional","I am a huge fan of Nickel Creek, have enjoyed them live, and own all their albums. Because of this, I would buy this set just for the live versions of ""move that mountain"" and ""the fox"". I already owned all the other songs on various albums, and was hoping for more live material. However, the DVD music videos are just okay, and the lighthouse song is truncated severely in the video. I was hoping for concert footage here too, rather than VH1/CMT videos. Oh well. The smoothie song video is a fun idea..."
5,Work Great!,"The lifts were easy to install, Fit perfect and work great. Now I don't get hit in the head everytime I open the glass on my Jeep!"
4,After-Market part - that says it all,"First, and most important, the product works.Issue: the connector(s) to the ball(s) use a retainer clip, and being universal, they're loose (there's play between the ball and connector) compared to the OEM equipment which used a 'locking' cap - couldn't find this type in an after-market part. Does it matter? It appears that it doesn't. Only time will tell. Suggestion: put a little lubricant on the ball (not a lot) before pushing the connector onto the ball. Someone mentioned they're stiff initially, which I found to be true, but after a break-in period (lifting and closing the hatch, the stiffness subsides/disappears)."
4,"Great game, but not worth money as it is legally free through open source","This game is great but should not be paid for because on http://trilogyrelease.bungie.org/ they are avaible for free on windows/mac/linux. also this download is free because in 2005 Bungie (the copyright holders)made them open source which means that they can be distributed for free. i would recommend this for collectors who want the packageing and what not. Hope this helped, and again, the game is a blast and for sure worth checking out, but maybe not worth the price when it can legally be obtained for free."
2,Disappointed,"I received this DVD as a Christmas gift and was very disappointed. There was very little of Dean, a not at all funny, and very lengthy Jonathan Winters skit, and the cover was misleading -- not all celebrities listed appeared in the DVD. All in all, a real letdown."
4,Dirty Red is Scandalous....,"This wasn't a bad read at all. Vickie Stringer created the characters really well and they all were realistic. Ms. Stringer has good imagination, especially, the part where Red put the dookey into Blue's enchilidas. Straight up disgusting!!! I supposed he deserved it after the way he took Red's innocense away.Anyway, the book was a trip along with the characters, and had my emotions on a rollercoaster. One minute, I felt Red was a genuine, caring, free hearted young woman, and the next minute, she was scandalous and cold-blooded.I felt sorry for Terry, I didn't see why she was the one that got the short end of the stick. Maybe, because she was an unfit mother?I didn't quite understand why Bacon was tripping over a $25,000 book deal when he was supposed to have dough stashed. I thought he was a baller?I will probably buy the sequel, because I want to know if Red got her revenge against that bastard Jerome and Mom or did she get dealt with."
4,I hate the ending,The book was good until the ending. I hate when books leave me with a question mark...Now I have 2 buy the next 1...If it dont end in that book Im leaving it alone
2,Waste Of My Time.....,"Ok all i really got out of the book was that ""Dirty Red"" was jus that a golddigger I mean to me the story seem like it was rush and wasnt well put together..i read the book in a day cause i thought since the beginning started off slow maybe toward da middle thing will begin to pick up...BOY was i wrong!! It had alot of drama but hummm idk...I dont wanna read the 2nk r 3rd part this book jus lost me!!!!"
4,RED IS SO DIRTY!,THE TITLE SPEAKS FOR IT'S SELF AND RED IS DIRTY! THE BOOK IS A GOOD READ AND WILL HAVE YOU ENTERTAINED ALL THE WAY THROUGH
4,Dirty Red,"Im surprised that this chic had any friends. Seems like everyone was dirty in this book, including Dirty Red's Moma.... The book was a good read.... Keep up the good work Vickie"
4,Low Down and Dirty,"I read this book in one day. It was a page-turner, but the end is very disappointing. I'm sure there will be a sequel.Raven ""Dirty Red"" Gomez lived for revenge. Dirty Red's heartbreaking childhood paved the way for her vengeful acts and the absence of a soul. When Dirty Red finally realizes she actually fell in love with someone, it's almost too late, and her fate winds up in the hands of just one person that she ""screwed."""
4,One of The Best,This is actually one of the best books i have ever read . Red had a hard life but she treated the nicest people wrong . I love her and Q's relationship !!
1,Not a Good Read,I'm not exactly sure why this book got so many positive reviews from other readers. This book was not a good read. It actually took me 3 months to read it and the only reason I actually did finish it is because I was in between books and decided to pick this one up and finish reading it while I was at my doctor's appointment. The story doesn't even flow and is VERY choppy. The story also has waaaaaaaaaaaay too many insiginifant characters as well. I'm not sure what the author was thinking when she wrote this. I would not recommend this book at all.
2,Average,It wasnt the worst I have read--I did get through it. But it was just average and predictable.
4,Sequel????,"Dirty Red was all right. I thought there would have been more action. Bacon chasing Red and Q in the airport with a gun; yeah right. Obviously how the story ended there should be a sequel. I do believe good books end with strong endings, either making you think or crave for that sequel. I will read the sequel out of curiosity; hopefully it won't take years to be released."
3,it was nice at the beginning BUT,THE ENDING WAS HORRIBLE... I WAS SO MAD THAT I WASTED MY TIME WITH THIS BOOK... IT WAS A SLOW READ ALSO BUT BY THE MIDDLE OF THE BOOK I LIKED AND THEN THE ENDING JUST MESSED UP THE WHOLE BOOK!!!
3,Dirty?,"Red was beyond dirty..she is filthy and grimey, but so are the other characters in this book. Everybody has hidden agenda and out to get over on one another, (even the ones who are supposed to be friends) No one is to be trusted! It was an ok read, took far to long for me to finish especially since it is under 300pgs. Towards the end it picked up a little..now I have to read Still Dirty to see just what happened."
4,RED!,THIS BOOK WAS GOOD I REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE. I WAS SURPRISED AT THE OUTCOME. RED IS A TRUE DIVA WHO WILL DO WHATEVER SHE NEEDS TO DO TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS! A GOOD READ
5,She's a bad Mutha Shut Yo Mouth,Dirty Red serves up some dirt in this novel. She lives by the true meaning of keep your friends close and your friends even closer (I wrote it right). If you cross her wrong she was out to get you back by any means necessary. This is a must read book.
1,Ewwwww....,"Based upon the reviews here and the fact that this was on Essence's best seller's list, I made certain assumptions about the book. i.e. that there would be a decent amount of GOOD writing. The characters were fluff, the plot thin, and the overall writing sketchy to say the least. This book has depth of a high school student writing a piece of fiction. I couldn't get past the 5th chapter. Maybe I'm missing something."
3,That's it????,I not a big fan for her books (we had to wait damn near TWO years for part II of Let that be the reason) but i decided to give this one a try. It's not as a exciting as you would think. Every one wants a piece of Red blah blah blah. She's 18 and pretty much has everything and everone wrapped around her fingers. The books seems alittle bit rushed along. I didn't really find the the main point of the story other that Red is a golddigger.I would say this book is alright if you are into immature ghetto books. Oh and b4 I forget.....I HATE THE ENDING. But then again that's how most of her books end.....with a question mark. ENJOY!
3,What a Downer,"After reading the reviews in Essence and on this website, I was really excited about reading this book. Boy was I in for a letdown. This is not the fast-paced page turner that everyone touts it as. As a matter of fact it took me almost two months to finish.As with a lot of these urban tales (and I hate to generalize) you can safely hypothesize the outcome about three chapters in. Even so, I was not impressed with the story line or character development. I have really grown weary of authors doing a very poor job of trying to re-create The Coldest Winter Ever."
5,She has redeemed herself.....,"When I read her first two novels I was impressed and intrigued by what she did to survive and feed her son. I was not impressed w/the stories in themselves, however DIRTY RED!!!!:) was off the hook, line and sinker. I must say this here is a read you must read and a book you will ENJOY!!!!!!"
4,Great Read!! Disappointing Ending!,Red is the dirtiest woman I have ever read about! It was a captivating read I could not put it down. The end was not good to me but to the author's credit I will pick up the sequel.
3,Red Red Red,"I hated Red at first, then I changed my mind. So whoever wants to read this go a head. But don't pay more then 10 bucks for it, because its only worth 5."
2,VERY DISAPOINTED,after reading all the reviews online i thought this would be a good book. boy was i disapointed the beginning started out good but as i continued to read it got boring. i couldn't even finish the book.
4,Pretty Good but not great (at least for me),"Ok, I bought this hoping that the editions of the movies where in fact the special editions, with all the same features, and when I got it and watched it I found out that there was no Spanish subtitles, just audio. This was a little disappointing for me, I live in Venezuela and the people I watch movies with doesn't speak English... that's why I give this product 4 stars, all the other features of the dvds are excellent and the extras are really cool."
2,Star Wars Prequel Travesty,"I tried liking these movies. When consensus was they sucked and I felt they did I wondered if folks were being too hard on them. Unrealistic expectations. Nah, they suck. There are these new Star Wars prequel video reviews for The Phantom Movie and Attack of the Clowns. These 70 and 90 minute, detailed, brilliant and hilarious reviews have proven once and for all that the prequels really are bad movies and vastly inferior to the original trilogy. They're available on YouTube and are must see to all interested in Star Wars and decent film making and story telling and for those that just want to laugh a lot. Better than Mystery Science Theater. George Lucas is a businessman first, a (poor)(soulless) film maker second. Watch the reviews and tell me what ya think. See Red Letter Media."
5,"Crap films, but even at its worse Star Wars can't get less than 4.99999 stars","Lucasfilms did everything in their hands to ruin the Star Wars saga. A clown, a sugary romance, a couple of crap actors in main roles, a couple of ridiculous scenes and excess of computer generated images that make it look like a playstation game.But they failed. Just Ewan McGregor's acting, seeing C3P0 meet R2D2, Obi-Wan meet Anakin (the circle begins) and have the emperor-to-be tell anakin that he'll watch his progress with great interest is worth 5 stars.Watching these films is not pleasure, it's homework for the original trilogy fan."
1,This Is The Evidence That George Lucas Hates His Fans.,"If you are a fan of Star Wars, George Lucas hates you. These prequels are a giant middle finger to GL's Star Wars fanbase. I know it's been said a billion times before, but I am reiterating here. One of the worst movie trilogies of all time. George Lucas should be sued for this."
1,Stop giving Lucas your money. Stop the insanity!,"Just gonna echo the sentiments of all the other prequel and ""Special Edition"" haters: Stop giving Lucas your money. Seriously. He's bled us all enough. The prequels are flat-out bad movies that won't stand the test of time. The Special Editions of 4, 5, and 6 are embarrassing mockeries, but not simply for artistic reasons. Lucas has gone on record claiming that it would be ""too expensive"" to restore and remaster the original versions of Star Wars for Blu Ray release. Pretty hilarious, coming from a billionaire who's about to get a billion dollars richer after this dog turd in a box comes out. This hypocrite is all for keeping black and white movies black and white to maintain their purity, preserving films for the good of history, but when it comes to his own work? Nah, it costs too much. Don't give this guy your money. Trust me, it's better spent on a slot machine."
5,What I wanted.,"This is not a review of the Star Wars pre-trilogy as a movie. The item came quickly and was in perfect condition. 3 disks fit neatly into a standard container which helps save room on your shelf. No movie previews upon playing the films, which is always good."
2,Third film was ok...,"The first film was an embarrassment... I was shaking my head in wonder when that idiot kid was having trouble reading the cue cards. How the heck could they have cast someone so bad?? And that Jar-Jar Binks thing that was begging to get shot in the head by a 20 gigawatt mini-gun blaster... One of the top ten biggest disappointments in film history...No. 2 was Ok. The terrible acting was of course second only to the abysmal acting in the first one. The only redeeming quality was the yoda light saber duel at the end.No. 3 I actually enjoyed a little bit. Was neat seeing Darth Vader in all his glory at the end. While the acting again - they should have cast Obi-Wan as the lead - wasn't so hot, the cool story made up for it.I would buy no. 3 in blue ray, but I don't think I could stomach watching the first two again, especially not the first one."
4,Star Wars Blu ray,"The thing about the original trilogy is that the picture quality has been maximized to its extent considering the quality of the original footage. The audio can be replicated and enhanced, but the video quality would not be up to our standards of high def picture."
3,why can i juz get episode 3,"i hate episode 1 and 2 because the acting is absolutely horrible and you will quickly grow tired of seeing these horrible movies. episode 3 is not that bad the acting is descent compared to 1 and 2, i just wish i could buy episode 3 seperatly because episodes 2 and 1 are unwatchable and yes there that bad.episode 3 is good but 1 and 2 arent."
3,"I like it, but didn't love it","I grew up with the original 3 star wars and though these were fun to watch, I wasn't super excited like I get with the originals"
5,great movies,loved the movies - even though I watched them in 'real' order so the better FX is at the beginning..then the old school FX
4,Star Wars lives,"It has been a while since I have seen the movies and the ones I have are on vhs tapes. There are no bonus features on the vhs tapes, so the dvd is a must for them. The behind the scenes stuff always interests me and commentary. These are great on this format."
4,Got my son hooked,"My son loves these books, he wasn't much of a reader till I got him a few of these. Now all he wants is more ;-)"
4,2nd disk skips / freezes - not pleased with the editing,"I'm very happy to have the last 3 pieces to the puzzle, however, I'm VERY displeased with the editing.The 2nd disk skips / freezes and the other 2 disks make you think they've frozen, but it's just a chopped up scene.Hollywood apparently doesn't care anymore except to get your money for the DVD's.Disappointed in that respect, but otherwise, they're ok."
1,Who doesn't already own this on Standard DVD?!!?!?!?!,"Please boycott this repackaging of the same product over and over again. We want BLU RAY! George, give it up man, I'm not buying the same six movies again. Well at least not on Standard DVD..."
1,Really?,I can't believe that people are actually buying this. These movies were a freaking travesty. Even more so on blu ray. Don't support Lucas!
1,Good grief....,"A new box doesn't make these films any better, George. Nice try. There is nothing new in this set folks, so don't bother."
5,star wars,"What can I saw about a movie trilogy that's been out for a while and that pretty much every American has seen, that hasn't been said before? Well, probably not a thing... LOL. This trilogy shares the story you don't don't see in the first three movies, but see what's hinted at. The first one is a bit slow, but after you watch the next two the dots are connected & you'll enjoy the whole series."
4,Just What I Needed,These 3 DVDs were exactly what I was looking for to complete my Star Wars collection. It was well worth the purchase.
3,Skip,"The cost is great, the three movie package is great, but my disc for movie I skips!! I did not expect this out of a brnad new product. I have bought a lot of merch. from Amazon, but this is the first item with a flaw. Do not know if I will by movies again."
3,Good Not Great,Great at being able to own all 3 Prequels at an affordable price then buying them individually though as far as Great DVDs go this one is lacking in terms of encoding and packaging! Still if you don't any then this the way to go unless there is a release in Blu-Ray which does not seem to be happening anytime soon.
3,DVD bundle,"Only two of the three DVDs worked. The third one didn't play at all. I ordered a new product but there was no wrapping paper around the case, telling me that it was not new."
1,Pure garbage,These movies are absolute garbage.How can anyone stomach watching this? The dialogue is torture. The acting is beyond bad.The prequels are awful; you know it and I know it. Stop pretending they're good. They're not.
1,Don't give in... that leads to the Dark Side,"I have long hated the Prequels and their painful acting, blunt plot, and ape-like storytelling, UNTIL... I found them perfectly realized in a new form.Lego Star Wars (Part I - Prequels) is a fun game. It tells the story of these prequel without the heavy-handed, fake drama. Let's be honest: These are movies about explosions and ninjas with laser swords. Shakespeare it ain't. The Lego game fulfills all that the Prequels were meant to be: Light on plot, heavy on collecting action figures.Do yourself a favor: Don't burn forty bucks and 6 (plus) hours of your life slogging through these movies. BuyLego Star Wars: The Complete Sagafor less money and more fun. That item, you'll go back to... these movies, they'll just collect dust."
2,Mediocre Sci-Fi,Just not a very good effort from Lucas. I'm not sure why anyone would watch one of these three films over one of the old three films.
1,The Force is not strong with these ones,These prequels were a monstrosity. No need for them in any format. One big CGI nightmare filled with plot holes and morning wood acting. No soul. Lucas should have moved on. Worse day in the history of cinema was when Georgie boy discovered a computer.
1,Nothing can redeem these films,"The ""prequel trilogy"" are probably the most disappointing films of all time. No amount of spit or polish (aka 1080p, re-mastering, up-res-ing, etc.) can make these films even slightly good. Each film has a nonsensical plot, horrible dialog, lazy cinematography (most soap operas are better than this), and even the bad special effects, which were clearly the only thing that Lucas cared about. It often seems like a 5 year old wrote these films. The CGI doesn't hold up, and looks extremely synthetic, especially Ep. 1. In all, each of these films are an unmitigated disasters.I've bought the DVD's, and I have to say I'm completely done with these terrible and unwatchable films. These are actually films that get worse the more you view them, as the plot holes become more and more glaring. At the very least, Lucas decided to sell the originals separately, which is about the only thing this box set is good for."
1,Greedy Jedi!! Greedy Jedi!!,"Lucas is a very greedy man and has not written or directed anything even remotely decent since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which he ruined by making scooby doo and the mystery of the alien heads(aka the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls. Everything since the Last Crusade has been awful which includes these three embarrassing movies. Both Anakins are horrible Horrrible HORRIBLE actors and the Chemistry between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman is terrible, which you really have to try for because Portman is very sensual (see closer). The dialog is garbage the movies are garbage and I doubt that they will look better in HD!! Thanks Lucas for being such Bantha poodoo."
2,No Original Version!,"Lucas can really be a butt. Yes, everyone wants the Blu-Ray version, but they also want a version without all the meddling new edits and butchery added to the original version that made Lucas famous and rich. He thinks he knows what we want better than we do, he ignores our pleas and does what he wants regardless. To claim the original negative was DESTROYED to make the new versions is like saying they destroyed the Mona Lisa to do a modern-art version of it (that no one really wants). But Lucas knows ""best""... the BUTT!"
5,May the Force not kick you in the face,"My boyfriend got these and LOVES them. Skinny cases take up less room, they're shiny and new, and well, he's a guy and it's Star Wars. He'll probably get all new ones now."
5,My hubby loves this,My hubby was happy to get this trilogy. He loves Star Wars and now he can watch them whenever he wants.
5,Worth the upgrade,We had the DVD versions of these movies. But it was very worth the money to upgrade to a Blu Ray. The biggest difference that I noticed was with the sound. The surround sound on the Blu Ray is a big deal. It makes you feel like you're in the action and it's someting new you haven't experienced with Star Wars since you saw it in the theatres!
4,Good BUT not great set rating for films NOT package,"Well, we all know George. This is the 1st release of the films to blu ray & it will NOT be the last. We know he will release them numerous times on blu ray.This set is for episodes 1, 2 & 3-Menace, Clones & Sith. No where as good as the original trilogyThe only extras are commentary.So, this is you bones bare set-if you just want the three films then this is for you. The nine disc complete set is better BUT not perfect.Rating for films NOT for package-package would get a 3."
2,Misled,"Pretty mad about this product. I'm sure somewhere in the details it may have warned me, but I saw the displayed product image and it shows the ""I II III"" of the episode trilogy box. But instead of getting the trilogy in a nice little box, the first three movies were simply taped together. Pretty cheap and unprofessional. Won't be getting my business anymore."
4,Looks amazing! but.....,"The movies themselves look amazing!! Absolutely Stunning! My biggest complaint was that on my sony blu-ray player the load times were unbelievably long!!!! My firmware is up to date, so i don't know what's going on, but out of my entire blu ray collection these movies are the longest loading hands down. By longest loading, i mean it takes literally MINUTES before the the menu loaded up and i could start the movie. I honestly didn't think the movie was going to start. Now, once all that loading is done, everything is zippy and chapter searching and what not is fast. I'm curious what others have experienced with the load times."
4,Star Wars Prequel Trilogy,What a great way to lead in to the main game of the real star wars. Story lines are a little thin but adequate for their purpose. Great watching for a fan.
5,The saga is complete,"in 1999 star wars episode 1 was released. it was an ok movie it showed darth vader as a youth as anakin skywalker, it showed how he was discovered it was a kids movie, episode 2 came out 3 years later it was too mushy but it showed the back story to how anakin began his fall to the darkside and it lead up to episode 3 the fall of anakin skywalker. they were good movies but now that the clone wars tv series has become a hit and now has left many holes in the prequel trilogy they may have to redo most of episode 3 and maybe the entire star wars movies. if they ever do that they should go the way of how the clone wars is. all in all i still give these series of movies 2 thumbs up"
1,Prequel Trilogy has no bonus features or extra's,"there are many reviews intermixed with the reviews of the 9 disc box set...this review is about the 3 blu-ray prequel trilogy with the Yoda face on the cover: THERE ARE NO EXTRA'S OR BONUS FEATURES ON THIS 3 BLU-RAY SET...i was terribly disappointed...no deleted scenes, no making of's, nothing...just a lousy commentary...(i hate people talking over my movie, this isn't Mystery Science Theater 3000 y'know)...movies are fine, but all the extra's are ONLY on the 9 disc box set (with boy Anakin on the cover on Tatooine)Lucas has robbed me again."
1,"GRANDKIDS LOVED IT! ME, NOT SO MUCH?","This was purchased as a gift for the grandkids (6-1/2 & 4-1/2 years of age)and they loved it. I, on the other hand (69 years of age)thinks George Lucas should have stopped with his original effort!"
2,not what was expectd,Does not have deleted scenes & that was not in the description. had to return it for the other box set
3,for the most part great,The item was what I expected. The problem is the Revenge of the Sith DVD skips from track 20 to 22 and amazon.com 's return policy requires me to return the entire set in order to replace the defective item.
1,Because Lucas must not be rewarded for his actions,"Lucas destroyed the original trilogy with his manipulations, Han shoots first, Vader says ""Nooooo""? I boycott all these releases until the original versions are restored for blu-ray."
3,All's well that ends well.,"The original product was missing a disk, although after contacting the shipper it was replaced and returning it was easier than I had feared."
1,I have some suggestions for the Special Edition.,"Hey George. How about instead of messing with the ORIGINAL TRILOGY, you change the movies that need changing? You can start by replacing Hayden Christionson and Jar Jar with new characters.Even that sadly would be like putting a band aid on the stump of a decapitated head."
5,Star Wars Prequel,"Star Wars: The Prequel Trilogy (Episodes I - III) [Blu-ray]. I recently watched these movies and I was simply blown away. There is no flaw in PQ or sound. Yeah these are not the original cuts of the movies, but if all you want is the movie, this is a good deal. No special features aside from a commentary on each film."
4,Good!,This star wars set is great. I had never owned any of them before and so I bought this and it's great. The price for it was even better.
5,Another impresive release!,"Another impresive release from Lucasfilm for a very reasonable price.A Beautiful collectors jacket and artwork you'll probally find yourself displaying in your entertainment room. Now just too clarify , this is not a new Big Defintive 30th ann. box set edition , that were all waiting for. This is simply a repacking of the movies too keep them in circulation. Now , I'm not entirely certain if these movie's have been further remastered or not. But It looks incredibly beautiful from the quality we have come to expect from Lucasfilm Ltd and THX. So my advice to the movie collector is if you want to update your Libary or you have need to purchace these picture's because of whatever reason as a collector , for yourself or as a gift , you can do a lot worse. But if you already have all the chapters and are just waiting for the big Bluray movie set , than your better off just passing these bye for now."
5,Amazing,This product was perfect and came early. It was exactly what i wanted the frst 3 starwars just great movies
4,Good Buy,"The discs came in excellent condition: a few ligt scratches, but the movie didn't skip at all. The DVDs did not come in a boxed set as pictured, but in separate DVD cases, one of which was mildly torn. Each episode also came with a bonus disc, of which I have yet to watch any. Overall, a great buy."
5,Lookin' good...,"The high definition is very good and im so glad I got it. Episode I has a little extra footage in it and master Yoda has been ""upgraded""! Episode 2's HD is a bit better but I didn't see any new stuff that wasn't already on the DVD release. I could be wrong but I doubt it.I haven't watched Episode III yet because im waiting for my next day off so I can do it right! ""What does that mean"" you ask? Im going to watch it with my Definitive Technology, 5.2, surround sound system and my Epson 8100 projector on my 106 inch screen.....Also, I can't wait for the theatrical 3D re-release of all three movies!"
2,Well the shipping was fast,"This was listed as a new product, when I got it in the mail and opened the package it was definitely not new. The disks were heavily scratched and I didn't even bother trying to play them, I just sent them back for a refund."
4,Star Wars Prequel,"It took them long enough, but they finally put out the first three Star Wars movies in a boxed set. No surprises here, but I wanted the complete set. The movies are better than they are given credit for. There can't be too many surprises when you know who has to survive and what the general situation is at a later time. But on their own, they are enjoyable and it is nice to see details in Episodes 1,2, & 3 that portend events in Episodes 4,5, & 6. George Lucas is consistent. Still, while there are few surprises with this set, the whole story is laid out, and we can go back to it at anytime. Too bad he gave up on episodes 7,8, & 9. I have no idea how the third trilogy would have developed."
5,What a Trilogy,"Not a review of the moive, just the product. All come separately packaged in their own case, with a big case for all of them. Looks good, THX, widescreen. There are extras, but haven't watched them yet. May the force be with you."
5,The Rise of Anakin Skywalker to Power,This boxset is so cool it has the three prequel films that chronicles Anakin Skywalker to eventually become Darth Vader also how it all began the phenomenon known as Star Wars great introduction to the Star Wars Saga.
4,A great star wars dvd pack,"Pros:great dvds cons:1 scrached dvd. I would reccomend it to everyone. It was great ordering this pack of dvds. Overal,loved it!@"
4,new to cloth diapering,"This is the first cover I've tried and it's great. I don't plan on trying others. It leaked the first time I used it because I hadn't adjusted it properly but since I check the fit, no leaks!! I use cloth while at home to cut down on costs. I don't recommend them for overnight...but if you want something affordable for during the day this is a winner."
1,Fabric wicks moisture,"While this cover is easy to use and fits well, I've noticed the fabric seems to wick moisture to the outside. I had my baby in the cover overnight last night, with an insert, and woke to find her soaking wet with a huge wet spot where she was lying. The diaper was totally tucked into the cover, and the whole back of the cover was wet. This is not the first time I've noticed this problem with the cover, and this morning I just threw it out. I don't know if it's the detergent I use or what, but get the Thirsties covers instead. They're much more moisture-resistant."
4,These were okay diaper covers,"I haven't used these in a while, but I remember that they were pretty good. Not my favorites, but good for the price and the weight range is pretty big."
3,It gets the job done,"When I decided to start cloth diapering my 14 month old, I bought some prefolds, fitteds and four covers of different brands. The Bummis Super Whisper Wrap was by far my least favorite.This diaper wrap is very sturdy and well made. It washes up beautifully and dries quickly. However, it is stiff, bulky (yes, cloth diapers are bulky, this cover is extra bulky) and fits awkwardly. The leg openings lack gussets, which means that you must take extra care to tuck and retuck the diaper to avoid wicking.My personal preference is for a softer, stretchier cover, such as the Imse Vimse Soft cover.Imse Vimse Bumpy Soft Cloth Diaper Cover - Large (20-26 lbs)However, friends of mine rave over the BSWW, and I can see for myself that the quality really is very good."
4,Good quality product,"I have a bunch of these covers and they have held up well. Some of them have been used for a couple babies and the velcro still works. The leg openings are a bit large for my daughter, but she is slender. It would probably be ideal for most other babies."
3,"Good, but incomplete","Fine choral and solo work, especially Teddy Tahu Rhodes, but this should be titled 'Messiah excerpts' as many choruses and so solos are missing.Where is 'And He Shall Purify''His Yoke is Easy' 'All We Like Sheep''Thou Shalt Break Them' 'But Thou Didst Not Leave His Soul in Hell' to mention a few? I bought this because it features Teddy Tahu Rhodes and am glad I did, but others may be disappointed at the above omissions."
4,This game rocks!,My 11 year-old daughter loves this game. It is a challenging race game. It even has a story to go along with the game.
3,worthwhile,"Good for non-profit managers and board members who are not familiar with the subtleties and possibilities of income earning opportunities. Also, those with some knowledge and experience of having partnerships with businesses can validate what they are doing and get other ideas. The book has many vignettes to illustrate the authors' ideas and suggestions. Most of these are real life examples, not hypothetical. The title, however, can turn off people, sounds almost greedy and tacky. If one persists though, I think the authors give a more respectable twist to the phrase, ""Filthy rich"", somewhere in the introduction, and dont mean what it sounds. In contrast, the title of Steckel's other book, ""Making Money While Making a Difference"" is more appealing. Steckel has academic and consulting experience, so I would give credibility; however, the title makes you wonder if it is overstated. Read with caution but enthusiasm, which is perhaps what the authors really intended."
1,Please remove my review -- see below for explanation,"Upon checking for my review just now, I realized that I erroneously reviewed this second edition. I assumed that I was writing about the first edition only. I have NOT READ the second edition. So please remove my review from the panel of reviews for this second edition. I could not leave the rating item blank, so the rating of 1--has no relevance. I apologize for the inconvenience."
1,useless,"The title should have been a warning. The information given is a general summary of the usual semantics found in Marketing 101 and Management 101. I have never seen a book with nothing but generalizations (239 pages in large print - it could easily fit into half that size) and no useful material. Whatever you are looking for, you will not find in here."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought 4 of these. At first I thought they were all broken. After careful testing with other batteries which were known to be good it turned out that out of 16 batteries, 7 were no good and had to be thrown out.The chargers themselves are fair. They can be a little sensitive about contacting the battery so make sure when you load them, that they light up properly.I do like the AC/DC part of it as I am a location sound recordist and sometimes need to charge the batteries in the truck."
2,How bout putting out a product that works straightforward.,"Just out of the box I put the batteries into the camera, the camera would not start. I figured oh maybe they need to be charged. Threw them into the charger, charge light wasn't on... Figured what the hell I guess they're already charged. Back to the camera and it wouldn't work. I just stuck them into the charger now and the charge light went on. It seems the charger is extremely sensitive. Theres too much space on either side of the battery and they're not held in snug so rotating the batteries will break the circuit unless they're in the right spot. Not the best charger at all. Hopefully it will take 90 minutes to charge up these 4 batteries, then I can review the batteries themselves.But the charger... terrible. Might as well buy a separate 4 pack of batteries and and a better charger."
2,"Old subject, new language","There's no real new ground breaking stuff here. The wit and eloquence mask work that is rather shallow. While the language is first rate and provocative, a careful analysis of the factual information presented shows a glaring omission of so many more facts that most of his premises are undermined when viewed in a larger, more realistic context.The best way to put this in perspective is that this author is a black man from poor, humble beginnings who's trying to make a case for how it is impossible for blacks to succeed in the very society that has made him into the wildly successful multimillionaire, author, speaker, professor, radio personality he is today.And the reason is the usual cop-out: it's someone else's fault.Two stars for wonderful use of language."
3,Fine storytelling and commentary,"The video does a fine job of giving a biography of Rembrandt. The analysis of his art is also admirable particularly the commentary by van Wetering. However, there really is nothing new here and it is primarily an introduction to the topic. If you are looking for something deeper you will need to search elsewhere."
3,The Thousand Plane Raid,"This movie is similar to COMMAND DECISION where their is more explaining and lobbying for the raid, than raid action itself.The movie was enjoyable and I will keep it in my collection and watch it several more times."
1,Not Happy With It,"When I opened the outside box, I couldn't lift the small box out. The description said 17 pounds, but it felt like 50 lbs. When I took the pen out of the box, it snagged my fingers and made them bleed. The edges were like metal slivers and I couldn't let my puppy cut its mouth and feet on the bad welding or cutting. It was well made, sturdy, but with the cuts I received trying to open it, I had to send it back."
3,very heavy item,This is an okay product.. It was just too heavy for my needs. My dogs are very small and I did not need this type of product.
1,"Rough edges, metal pieces and patchy 'gold zinc'","Fast shipping from Amazon as usual, product arrived ok packaged. Assembly was easy, but using cheap, not adequate hardware. Plastic 'stabilizers' fell of as soon as puppy jumped up against it.The biggest problem however is the bad welding job on the metal mesh, parts are just rough whereas in other areas metal pieces/ particles come of the product, both defects can be damaging to animals imo. The gold-zinc coating is also patchy and comes off on certain spots - rust will likely occur soon!Going to return it to Amazon and trying to find a better product.HE"
3,Good xpen for the $ but snaps are garbage,"Like the walk through design. Prefer gold as the rust doesn't become so obvious as on the black pens (and they all do eventually rust). Have purchased probably a dozen midwest xpens over the years and have had a few of the connecting bands fall apart but other than that, they are fine. My only complaint with this shipment is they have gone cheapo with the snap clips...light weight metal and very hard to open. Will likely chuck them and use larger, smoother snaps."
5,Great Price!,"Awesome price, and works like a charm!!! Great way to have your pet do their business in one area, or for whatever your intended purpose. I like the several ways it can be set up. Very easy to change or move."
1,not quite up to par,It just wasn't what I had hoped. The edges are very rough. Very easy to scratch yourself on or snag clothing. It isn't as sturdy as I had hoped and my puppy managed to climb right out of it even though she's very tiny. (she's a pomeranian puppy and only weighs 2 pounds)
5,Great pen for puppy,"Bought this pen to keep my then 3 month old Corgi/Chihuahua in a specific area in my apartment when I left for work and school. Went ahead and got the 30 inch height fence and I'm glad I did because now my puppy jumps a lot and the height is still too tall for her. The pen folds flat very nicely, only complaint is that it is a little heavy. But that's what you get when you're getting heavy duty pen. My dog (5 months / 6 lbs) pushes up against the sides and jumps, but has never been able to knock it over. Great pen to have!"
4,Pet Pen Expands,I wanted to enclose a rather large area in a semi-permanent way....I purchased several of these pet pens and they work just great! Just tall enough that my little dog can't get out and yet lightweight and easy to put up and down. The gold/zinc makes them rather disappear into the landscape as well.
5,Great,This item helped me out alot .... My puppy loves being outside but with no fence i couldnt let her run free.
3,OK for what I needed......,"The pen came in handy for my 8 week old pup while we camped for 5 days....however, the ""stabilizers"" did anything BUT stabilize the pen. It was really wobbly. Also, the stakes never wanted to stay in the ground....not sure why. But like I said, we only used it for 5 days, so it was an expensive purchase but we needed it nontheless."
5,Excellent way to manage your pet,"I have a nine week old Dachshund puppy. He darts around the house and usually positions himself at my feet, cleaning the house is nearly impossible. The exercise pen is perfect way to detain the curious puppy while doing household chores and providing your pet a same enclosure."
5,Great Quality,Very good quality and easy to transport. We use it both at home and for travel. Vaery durable and good looking.
4,Comfortable Haven,"This product is affordable, good quality and a wonderful solution for a dog that is being house trained. It keeps them out of danger and getting into trouble when owner/owners are not home. There is plenty of space for any pet to sleep, play and eat during the confined time. I am very pleased with my purchase."
1,A mediocre one-handed read,"Like Tyler's other books, this is yet another batch of smut stories that all sound as if they were written by the same person. Not much imagination going on here. Just repetitive sex with repetitive characters. Dull dull dull."
1,A Bore,Each story has a different author...however they all use the same verbage. Their either all friends or the same person. I do not like this book nor does my husband.
1,Silly stories from A to Z,And that about sums it up -- silly formulaic [stuff] for people whose VCRs are on the blink and can't watch their fave porn video. Not exactly intelligent erotic reading. There are far superior collections of erotica out there. This happens NOT to be one of them. Save your money and don't insult your intelligence.
3,not that [exiting]!,i bought this book thinking that it was going to be [exciting} and hot. It seems as if the stories start and end fairly quick like i was disappointed!!!
1,crude not interesting writing,I was disappointed with this book. Was expecting well written erotic tales not this stuff.
2,too much homoerotica,I appreciate that there has to be some of this to cater to the various tastes out there--but this book has way too much. I read 4 stories in a row that were either about lesbians or bisexual men.I am going to stick to books that have more balance or emphasize hot sex between men and women. The other stuff just doesn't do it for me. I got bored and started turning the pages fast. Disappointing!
5,Whew!,Make sure you have a big glass of ice cold water with you when you read these stories! Because your body heat will definitely rise when reading this book. I enjoy erotica stories and well I wasn't disappointed with this book. I don't think my husband was either. Good to read to get the juices flowing before being with your significate other! Worth the pennies for this book I say!
2,A to Zzzzzzzzz,"OK, there might be a place for this mainstream-type erotica -- nothing too ""dark,"" as other reviewers put it, but unfortunately nothing too terribly hot, either. Nothing surprising, nothing thought-provoking, nothing literary. Sorry. The stories DO all sound like they were written by the same person -- the work of a ham-handed editor, maybe? For that matter, many of the reviews, including most of the five-star ones, for this book sound like THEY were written by the same person. That's suspicious. But nobody else has pointed out the recurring editing problem in this book: so many of the stories have gender pronoun mistakes! It will be a story about two women and a sentence will refer to one of them as ""he."" This happens almost a dozen times throughout the book. What's up with that? Did we convert some hetero- to homosexual stories, or vice versa? And why didn't anybody catch this before it got into print? If other readers noticed this too, please speak up."
3,Okay but nothing great,This book is okay. But not nearly as good as some erotica anthologies that I have read. Save your money on this one and spend it on the His and Hers erotic anthologies.
5,hot erotica,"This book is full of hot stories and it's so cute! I highly recommend it for quality, realism, great characters and very imaginative fantasies."
2,LITTLE BOOK OF HORRORS,"NOT a serious scientific study nor a very mature work. Quite an easy read, with lots of pictures and brief descriptions. The chapter on ginseng is somewhat informative. Some rather (unintentionally) amusing grammar."
3,"Good pictures, bad information","This book served the purpose I was looking for - Pictures of different Firebird and Trans Am models through the model's 33 years of life. The pictures and layout are great. All pictures are full-color, and feature some beatiful cars.However, the downside to this book is the faulty information this book contains for those that do more than just look at the pictures and captions. The author did very poor research on the changes through the years, especially in the 4th gen era, and in several cases, incorrectly identifies the year of a pictured model. Also, the book contains several glaring typographical and grammarical errors. It's a shame more attention was not given to the text, as everything else is well produced."
3,Good Pictures,"I bought this as a christmas present for my husband even after reading the other reviews. I looked at it myself, it does have good pictures but that's about it my book had 2 chapter sixes and I think some of chapter 5 printed in chapter 6 it is poorly put together not sure if the pictures are worth $15.00 but my husband seems to think so, I'm happy."
1,Not a very good product,My husband and I bought this product when I first got pregnant and waited till about week 20 to use it. NOTHING...We again tried to use the microphone every few weeks but heard nothing but static. The microphone picked up every sound so we were unable to hear our baby's heartbeat. My suggestion is to wait and see your professional doctor then to buy this product....
5,Does what it's supposed to,"I use one of these to plug into my macbook pro so I can get surround sound/optical out of it.Does exactly what it's supposed to do. A little bit flimsy, but so long as you don't beat it up, won't be an issue.Can't go wrong for 2 bucks (though the shipping + handling costs more than the product)"
3,It is what it is,Hard to rate something that once installed just is. It works but then again it has no moving parts so.....
1,Bait and Switch,"The item received was not the item pictured. I received the item sold as a ""Recoton"" mini toslink adapter--which costs a lot less.So, this is a classic bait and switch move--but revised and updated for the online world."
3,Great Product The worst Shipping!!,I ordered 4 of these. The product worked as stated. The shipping and handling was OUTRAGEOUS!!! The total weight was less than one ounce and was sent by first class mail for 41 cents and the company had the baXls to charge $6.95 for s/h!!!! I saw the s/h charge and expected overnight but no four days later it arrived. This company should NOT be part of Amazon!!
5,A classic book on mineral deposits indispensable in every private and university library on geology,"This was one of the first books in USA to integrate in a modern way, at that time, the theory of formation of ore deposits with hundred of examples from different parts of the world. It set the need to use field work coupled with laboratory work to study the origin of ores and established the theory of hydrothermal processes in the formation of many mineral deposits. The hydrothermal theory has been used widely ever since with a very orthodox view by some geologists which was not a proper stand of W. Lindgren, one of the most influential geologists on genesis of ore deposits in the 20 century. He was one of the founders of metallogenesis and of the Society of Economic Geologists. A classic book on mineral deposits indispensable on every library. See the Society of Economic Geologists publication ""Economic Geology"" for the description of the Waldemar Lindgren Medall."
5,Perfect,"The meditation is deep, I use it with myself in the begining and now I let it play for my daughter all night. No better way to tell her how grateful I am for having her here, and that she has a place here for her. Beautiful."
2,Poorly written,Not what I expected. I wanted more recipes. Not enough pictures or well written enough to do without pictures. Wish I had not ordered.
3,Decent workout,"Not as good are her Breathless Body DVDs 1 & 2, but good for a reasonable workout. Full disclosure, I am a hard core workout buff so this was a bit easy for me, but might be better for beginners or intermediate level."
5,Challenging Workout,"I did everything back to back, and I was surprised at how challenging this workout was. Definitely expect your legs to hurt from all the squats! It is an incredible workout at a fast pace, yet easy to follow, and Amy changes things up enough to keep things interesting. I didn't feel like I missed out at the gym, either, and that is really rare."
1,not as described,set incomplete from what i can tell. NO INSTRUCTIONS for my girlfriend!!!!! a booklet with detailed intsructions should be provided for someone unfamiliar with ben-wa balls. a waste of money!!!!!!!!!!
5,Amazing debut album,"LUX's debut album, Seeing is Believing, is a really amazing song cycle. It is unfortunate the group split soon after its release leaving their work in relative obscurity, for they had excellent studio chemistry. I was fortunate enough to stumble upon their music early on and highly recommend this album to all listeners. It is a true gem."
2,The Madness that was....Madness,"This was your random slasher B list movie. I believe this was a Swedish movie, but it supposedly took place in America, where 2 teens were headed to a Cheerleading competition, met two other dudes who had a broken down car, that hitched a ride with the cheerleaders until that car broke down, and yer classic murdering hillbillies with too much land come pick `em up, and Madness ensues.. I think a problem was the random mix of Euro and American license plates. Anyway, they all had Swedish accents though they were supposed to be American. They were all supposed to be teenagers but appeared to be like 29 or 30. So, I'd skip this one.. and yell at someone Swedish for making this one. I wouldn't consider this a 'gay bondage movie' as there was one scene of a male being victimized by the hillbillies that lasted less than 5 minutes, i think it was 5 minutes too much for certain other reviewers who may not be so comfortable with their own.. movie watching experience."
5,great gas can,"This is a very good gas can much easier to use than the new safety cans.I would highly recommend this product,this is the second one I purchased and will get a third one soon."
5,Does the job,I love it because it does what it's suppose to. The price was right and so was the product. I recommend this to anyone how needs. That's anyone who drives!
5,Great Gas Can,This is a great gas can with the vent hole. My only regret is instead of buying just 2 I should have ordered at least 5. To bad they are discontinued.
2,It's not the great test.,it does the job but it doesn't look that strong that it not last to long. they have better ones for the same price look around.
3,Just in case,"Purchased it for contingency in the even there is gas shortage from another ""Sandy"" like storm in the future. A little expensive though."
5,"Moeller Scepter Vented Gas Can (5-Gallon, Military Style) Is awesome!","I bought two, they are awesome and the price is unbeatable anywhere else. Seven more words required, oh three, one."
5,Great Product This is the one to get!!,"Sturdy, solid, well made. GREAT DESIGN. I know its a gas can, but I've seen some cheap cans in the past. This one is a must if you need quality."
5,Finally one that works!,It's great to finally get a vented gas can that you don't end up spilling gas due to some anti-emission valve thus causing more spillage.
3,does the job,"The filters do the job but need to be changed very often. Since the are not cheap, the cost of running the machine really adds up over the winter."
3,OK CD,"The cd was good, but Joan Baez does better music than this cd shows. But all in all, still a good cd."
3,Incomplete,The CD does not cover all the songs of the original double album. How could Joan (or the editors) drop Silver Dagger?
3,Good but not great c.d. transition.,"I had the original album and was dissapointed by the omission of Will the Circle Be Unbroken. This song, which can be found on David's Album has a great group of background singers to give power to it. Also lackng was Green Green Grass of Home. It does start off nicely with Ghetto. Also Dylan's With God On Our Side which to this date I feel is the only version that I like."
1,Very bad sound quality,"One of the worst doo-wop / vocal groupo compact discs I've heard for a long time! Every other CD might have the same tracks in better sound quality, this is just the worst quality soundwise - avoid it!"
2,Zork Grand Inquisitor - disappointing follow-up,"I thought that the previous adventure, Zork Nemesis, was one of the best puzzle/adventure games I've ever played, compelling storyline, atmosphere, mystery and challenging puzzles - took 6 months of intensity to complete. I couldn't wait for Zork Grand Inquisitor, rushed out and bought it as soon as it hit the shelves, but was disappointed by the lack of depth and simplistic puzzles. Nice graphics, great humour but only 18 hours total gameplay to complete wasn't worth the $$."
4,very fun,"This is exactly the kind of game I enjoy. It has a story line, a goal for the user and I didnt have to kill anyone to play.The puzzles were pretty easy but it just gave the game momentum."
2,was not to Crazy about his one,"was not to Crazy about his one, I think Zork Nemisis was much better. This one has this most Annoying voiced lamp that guide you through your journey. I was not too impressed with this one, the puzzels were too easy. Zork Nemisis was much better."
5,Ave Maria,"This is a wonderful warm & charming movie.A very original way of seeing Paris,and one of the best scenes ever communicating the relationship between music & passion.Highly recommended ,I'm sure any sensitive viewer will be seduced by this film's innocence."
5,"Celestial, yes!!","I saw this movie in the theater three times in a week and when it was shown on the Sundance Channel I made a video tape of it.I really don't know how many times I've already seen it. All the actors were great and believable within this unbelievable silly and delightful movie.I just love ""Armand's entrance""!and what about Professor Gregorieff?If you like this type of quirky, funny art-house film, this is a must.You'll take it out and view it as many times as I have.P.S. If you like this movie get this filmaker's (Fina Torres) other gem:WOMAN ON TOP with Penelope Cruz at her most beautiful."
5,Really seals dirt and rain out,"I used this on my Ranger after putting an Extang Encore tonneau on it, and it really seals good. I did have to remove the factory flaps on the sides of the bed that are supposed to stop dust to get a better fit, but I am happy with the fit and the seal"
4,Lund 30002 Genesis Tailgate Seal,"After installing a tonneau cover, driving down a dirt road, and then later trying to get all the micro dust out of my Rhino bed liner - I decided I needed something to prevent this from happening again. Application of the seal was easy. So far it's held up but there are still two gaps on either side of the tailgate (top and bottom). I don't blame the seal but rather the design of the bed and tailgate of my truck (09 nissan titan pro4x)."
2,tail gate seal,The product does seal the back of the truck but parts of the tailgate are peeling the gasket off along the bottom of the truck box
4,Baez shines on her own songs,"I first had this on album and then on 8 track. I especially like""Outside the Nashville City Limits"", which she wrote about a trip with Kris Kristophersen to visit the writers of ""The Long Black Veil"". Also the haunting song ""Thee Horses"". This c.d. proved that she was not only a gifted singer but a prolific songwriter as well."
5,Why two CD's,"When this album came out in 33rpm, the extra two songs were on an inserted 45rpm disc ... hence the seperation today I suspect. This too got me started with Joan although it was almost 30 yrs later before I saw her live in concert .. and that is an unforgettable experience that I've enjoyed twice now."
3,Very useful,"If you are studying Romania, in any way, this book is very useful. But, there could have been more information easily put in this book to specify ""Historical Dictionary of Romania"" much better. It would be great if this book was updated. This book also has many things taken from it and used in Treptow's Vlad III Dracula. I am just stating this, if you are intending on buying more of Treptow's book's."
5,Excellent read,"Great book. It's a thriller with deep dive into human and 'non-human' psychology. From beginning to the end keeps the reader glued to the story line. Have many delicious discussions on meaning of life and death. Great style, enjoyable metaphors, true Zen spirit."
3,mediocre at best,"if you are a big fan of these movies and dont already own them on VHS then grab them, otherwise there is nothing to really entice you towards the DVD releases."
1,OBVIOUS AND SENSATIONALISTIC,"Of course it is essential to be informed about this and any industry in which one plans to become involved. But this book is intended to be sensational, to scare poor parents into fearing for their daughter's (or son's) safety and psychological health. All good parents already fear this. Some step-by-step instruction and real information on how to find your place in the industry, how to deal with agents and clients and sensible advice on communicating effectively with your teenager (who wants to model) would be far more helpful"
1,Not worth it,"I could tell you everything that I learned from this video in about 30 seconds, and I didn't know much before."
2,Too expensive,It would be nice if you could pay actually pay less for the Kindle copy than the printed copy. I can just read the most important news on my iPhone. I would rather be able to read it on the Kindle by its not worth it.
2,should be included w my subscription like the ipad,i hava paper subscription and was surprised to learn that the kindle edition was extra and cant be linked to my account like the ipad app can at no addtl cost. thats a disapointment for lesser quality graphics too.
2,Way too expensive,The subscription fee of $28/month is just way too expensive for electronic copy that not even include the whole paper or pictures. The text reads great but it's hard to get a glimpse of every section. The NYT app for Ipad just looks way better and more practical. I like reading on kindle but the price should reflect the quality. NYT probably wants reader to get on their time reader subscription instead....and it is still cheaper than kindle edition.
2,Disappointed with NYT in Kindle DX,"I got the Kindle less than a month ago, and I am considering returning it. My main interest has been to read the NY Times in it, which is quite easy to do in the Kindle when I ride the subway in New York. However, whole sections of The Times are missing. For example, Wed. June 17, 2009, the Science section did not appear in the download. Also, pictures are missing. It is very disappointing. I downloaded one book thus far and that has been good. I copied an audiobook bought from Amazon from my computer to the Kindle. I placed it in the ""music"" section, as the Kindle instructions suggest. Yet, there is no evident way on how to access it and play it. Not pleased."
1,A NEWSPAPER WITHOUT SPORTS SCORES,"A newspaper without sports scores is ridiculous. I just canceled my NYT Kindle subscription because of this. And Amazon doesn't warn subscribers--Amazon says box scores may not come with the subscription, but it does not warn that in fact no sports scores at all come with the subscription, unless there happens to be an article about a sporting event that includes that event's score. What a waste--great concept, great technical execution, but then a glaring and stupid content lapse wrecks the whole thing."
3,Sunday edition Kindle,"I enjoy the Sunday Times and the price is excellent...that's why I buy it. The problem with the Kindle version is the Texas based news is prominent. The magazine and other sections cut the photos and illustrations, which can be central to the article. The front page, opinion section, book review are great."
5,My Sunday Treat,There is nothing better than reading the Sunday Review and the magazine and all the op-ed in the Sunday Times. I love it on my kindle.
4,The best written news anywhere,"The New York Times just has the very best writters/reporters in the world. It is simply put, a joy to read. I only wish my amazon reader would give me more photos. They would be the one thing that would move me to give a 5 star rate."
1,Nothing for print subscribers,"I have been a print subscriber to the NYT for many years. Now I can also read it on my computer and almost any mobile device EXCEPT my Kindle where my only option is to pay an additional 240 dollars a year. In response to this, I reduced my print subsciption to weekends only. It was the only way I could penalize the idiotic marketing department of the newspaper I love."
1,More cost less quality,How do you justify the digital edition with all the corrections day after day? Are your writers as uneducated as the population you always write about? My Times started at 6.99 and is now 19.99. Don't tell me I have purchased an increase in quality. I feel like I'm buying plastic from China. I will continue subcription for a short time because from my zip code I can't get delivery. I would rather pay for the print edition than to contend with the lack of good reporting in the digital edition. You usually have three front page stories then a page of corrections. Your national and international sections are more like the daily rundown of the States in the USA Today. Sorry! This is not the Times I've always loved. FYI: I am 78 years old.
4,It's all about single issues,"The NY Times is a bargain for a one-off purchase, not for a subscription. The sunday issue is a bargain at 99 cents and the daily issue is a good value."
3,"Love it, but...","I loved reading the Times on my kindle during my trial period, but $28 a month is outrageous for an e-version of any paper. If it was 1/3 to 1/2 the price OR if I could just get the weekend papers, I would likely subscribe immediately. As it is, I can't.But, about the product, the paper is fantastic."
1,Fragmented Content for $20 a month? No Thanks,"Let me see if I have got this right.The journalists and editors write these stories on computers and same them to files. Those files then go to the print shop to be converted from digital to printed media at an incredible cost in paper electricity ink and equipment.Next they go to the Digital Publishing department (emailed to Amazon) or at no real cost upload it to amazon who then distributes the content for them from servers that amazon pays for.First they devalue it by only providing a portion of the printed copy, then they jack the price up to $20. In an age where a TV or Radio can transmit information for free, not to mention in a world where I can ""Google"" from just about any phone...Why in the WORLD would I pay this much for devalued/fragmented content? That's like watching a movie and NOT getting to watch the ending.On the high-end, the most I would pay is $9.99 a month."
2,confusing,I wanted to get the sunday paper but all I saw was the add for a subscription. I had to click on the subscription button to access the daily only button.
2,20 Minutes to unsubscribe feels like theft,"It's sad that I have to give this another bad review. I love the New York Times and loved it on Kindle. It was easier to manage and I could speed read it on the Kindle unlike the print. Then there is the guilt of no trees left behind after too many years of print.But if you are going to sell a subscription on Kindle, we should be able to end that subscription on Kindle. Moreover, it shouldn't take my web savvy partner 10 minutes to figure out how to do this after I have spent 10-15 minutes myself. This is default theft. Shame on you Amazon-New York Times."
1,Where's the Gray Lady,"Feels like all the journalist have left to get real jobs. Too much opinion by the ""reporter."" I want the total story and not the personal bias of the reporter/editor. I don't buy it in paper form any more and certainly not on my Kindle."
2,If you want a Liberal slant to all news,"I've been getting the NYT on the Kindle for several months. It is formatted well for the Kindle. I overlooked the many Liberal editorials because of the Kindle experience.But, today was the last straw. A very negative slant about Mrs. McCain on the FRONT PAGE. If you wamt to put this trash in an editorial fine, but, to disguise this trash as news.....not for me.I immediately canceled and subscribed to the Washington Post."
1,Radicalism in crescendo,"It was a good independent newspaper for years. Is now a radical powerfull media serving to liberals, radicals, leftist and extremits. Is going down specially because it reputation go very bad every single day. People look for real news, the true, the independence from lobbies, but NYT is going far left that the old readers do not respect. Changes in the paper are in progress but the damage is there already, loosing tremendous numbers of suscribers. The full media group TIME-Warner is falling apart."
1,Sorry Newspaper,"I would not accept a subscription to this newspaper if it was free. Some of the things they have informed the people have bordered on traitorous. When you read between the lines, you can see this is one of the most biased newspapers in the country. I hear they are going broke and I for one am glad to see it."
3,No iPad support,"I used to be a big fan of the Kindle NY Times subscription and didn't mind the lack of pictures, since the price was lower than other tablet or online subscriptions.Now that I use both my Kindle (keyboard) and iPad to read books, magazines and newspapers, I am quite annoyed that I have to choose between reading the Times on my iPad and reading it on Kindle. I eventually opted for the iPad subscription, partly since I get photos/videos/charts/etc. for the same price since the subscription rate went up.If I could read the Times in my Kindle app on my iPad (as I can with other periodicals), I wouldn't hesitate to give this 5 stars, but as it stands anyone with an advanced tablet is better off with one of NY Times' other digital subscription options.Also, note that no crosswords are included with this subscription (a crossword subscription is a separate offering)."
5,Best way to get news on the Big Island of Hawaii.,"I can turn on my Kindle Saturday evening and start reading the Sunday New York times. Otherwise, I would have to drive 30 minutes to the nearest store and pay $12.00 for the paper and then drive back to the house for another 30 minutes. With my Kindle I save time and money."
4,"Comprehensive, Well Written News",There are many ways to get the news these days. In fact it barrages you through all the media all day long. But I choose to read the New York Times on my Kindle to get the facts and opinions. It's like an anchor in a storm.
4,bunjosreveiw,i like the paper very much but i also receive usa today and two papers plus the local is a little much so i must deceide which ones to keep.
5,Sunday New York Times Kindle Edition,"The New York Times Kindle Edition is well organized and easy to read, plus an excellent value to get all the content for 99 cents on Sunday. It has everything except (sigh) the puzzles."
3,paid obits please,"COMPLAINT! We older folk depend on the obituary notices to tell us who is the latest friend gone to receive his or her reward, but only the obit articles about notables appear in the Kindle edition, not the paid notices of lesser mortals. Otherwise I find the Kindle NY Times a great boon, and easier to read than the print edition."
5,Love reading NYT on my Kindle!,"For my use, the content on the Kindle edition of the NYT is perfect. I love the Arts section and the Science section (on Tuesdays). Price is pretty fair, although it could be a bit cheaper (hint, hint). I've never had an issue that was not delivered or any problems with delivery via wi-fi. Now, if I can just get my husband to stop stealing my Kindle to read the newspaper..."
2,NYT Auto delivery feature - Not as promised,"The Kindle's auto delivery feature for the New York Times does not live up to its description, at least not in Brazil. The Times does not arrive to my kindle overnight or in time for my morning coffee, as promised. Unless I decide to have my first coffee in between the hours of 10am and 11Am Sao Paulo time."
1,Disappointed,"One of the reasons that I got a Kindle was as a convenient reading device when carrying a laptop isn't practical. I have a weekend print subscription to the NY Times, and I thought that would extend to cover the Kindle version. However, unlike what I thought I read on the NY Times ""Digital Subscription"" web page, it turns out I have to pay for a second subscription if I want the ""e-reader"" version in addition to the print version.I thought about switching entirely from my print subscription to the ""e-reader"" subscription, but that would be a significant downgrade since the ""e-reader"" edition (a) is missing a LOT of articles that I enjoy (e.g. Science, Technology, David Pogue ....), and (b) is only updated daily. I've decided that I'm better served by keeping the print subscription, reading the NY Times website when I can, and canceling the Times subscription for my Kindle.In summary, the Kindle version of the NY Times is a complete failure for me."
2,missing too many sections,Why pay for a newspaper that is missing key sections? I will subscribe when the entire paper is on the Kindle. No science section and the absence of David Pogue's articles is a deal stopper.
2,Where's the Health and Science News?,"I'm very peeved that the Kindle edition has seen fit to exclude the most interesting parts of the newspaper to me, viz, the science and health news. As far as I'm concerned, keep the business and sports sections, give me the science and health sections. Please, Powers that Be at the Times, take this plaint seriously, and include health and science in the Kindle edition"
2,Price still to high,"I like the NYT - I had subscribed for 2 years - but the kindle edition is too overpriced. With no printing, no delivery and no graphics, why are they still charging $20 a month?? In my humble pinion, it is a bad bad bad business model - make it $10 a month and they can more than double their kindle subscription."
1,"$19/month, forget it...",I'm sorry NYT but you can't keep jacking prices up like this. It's totally out of line. Time for me to switch to another paper.
3,good not great,"I have 3 days worth of the NY Times on the kindle. I love the convenience of getting it every morning no matter where I am. It reads well on the kindle. I also like paying about 25% as much as I did for home delivery. The major problem I have is that the kindle edition does not include any standings, tables or boxscores in sports. That is a major shortcoming"
2,Kindle New York Times costs too much,I'm not willing to spend over $200 for a newspaper. The NYT needs to drop their price closer to $60/yr.
1,Way over priced,"They are charging $19.99, which is more than it costs for the print edition and it isn't even the entire paper. This is over priced."
2,Unreliable service,"I signed up for the free 2 week trial and I'm glad that's all I did as I have now cancelled it. My problem is not with the New York Times itself; the articles are well written, cover a wide range of news topics and are well presented on a Kindle. However, I only have WI-FI Kindle so I need to be at home to do the downloads. Three times in the first week, when I switched the WI-FI on, nothing happened. I tried to manually resynch, but again, nothing. So, three times in the first week I left for my commute to work with nothing to read on the train. It definitely wasn't my home network as I was able to connect to the internet just fine. If I'd had a 3G Kindle I could have tried the download later, but I don't so I need reliable and instant downloads. Without it, the subscription would be a waste of money."
2,Grossly overpriced,"I would like nothing more than a fairly priced NYT subscription for my Kindle. But $20 per month is absurd, particularly without the entire paper. Halve the price, and we're in business."
1,wtf $$$,I'm no formatting specialist but this pricing is absurd. I live im Maryland and the kindle version would be just as expensive as having the paper delivered via snail mail.
1,Price hike is laughable.....certainly not worth it,Just saw that the price for the NYT Kindle edition skyrocketed to $19.99! It was barely worth it at $13.99. I enjoy some of the content of the NYT and certainly love the Kindle....but will choose a more sanely priced newspaper for my daily enjoyment.***Update 9/8/11: Now the Kindle version is a laughable $27.99. My only thought is that the NYT wants out of the Kindle market. It was not worth the earlier pricing and is certainly a joke at the increased pricing. How sad for them as it appears the Times is in a freefall and desperate to stay above water. This pricing is not the answer for them.
3,"Great on Kindle Device, but does not work on Kinde for iPhone or iPad.","I like to read the NYT on my Kimdle device. I would also like to read it on my iPad and iPhone using the Kindle App, but it is not available. Other newspapers, such as the WSJ, are available and I read it on all of my devices that support Kindle content. Please add NYT to Kindle for iPad and iPhone so I can download the entire issue and read offline. Thanks!"
1,more political agenda than news,"Besides the high cost for a partial newspaper, much of the so called news is directly tied to the editorial pages with a resounding agenda in most articles. Objective journalism would be nice."
3,the new york times,"i have read the new york times for many years, mostly on sunday. the paper is becoming more liberal in my opinion. i do not enjoy reading it as much as in the past. the well street journal is taking its place in some of my reading."
2,"Great format, same old views",The best of the Kindle newspapers with a great format. I could not stay with it because of its editorial stance.
2,Good!,I like reading NYT on my kindle much more easily. Thanks a lot and I hope to enjoy NYT everyday. Hope the service from Kindle can be better.
4,Last Resort in Changing Times,"The New York Times is a great newspaper, always was, always will be. Yes, there have been troubles, but they strive to make certain that they deliver what they can in a direct, informative, honest way. I wish, though, they would improve their electronic paper that is sent to Kindle. My B & W somewhat older Kindle is adequate, but the paper seems lackluster, as the photos from the articles are not available."
4,Lamestreet ?,"One seems to hear a lot of criticism of ""lamestreet"" media so I read the NYT to find out what all the fuss is about. Sure, it has a political point of view, but on the other hand there is some attempt at fairness and the Sunday Times does give a good synopsis of the week's news. Mostly I get this from the section that shows the previous week's most emailed stories. When the Dick Cavet column is included it makes for some enjoyable Sunday nostalgia."
2,New York Times Must get BETTER,How can the New York Times put out a Kindle edition without the crossword puzzle.? Absurd!! and the Book Review Section without all the reviews? The mystery editors who are abbreviating the electronic edition have to rethink....!! It's wonderful to have a nice comfortable way to read the paper in all tight places but not when the stuff you love is let out... Please rethink this. Please...
2,Not enough content; price too high.,"I tried the trial for almost two weeks. While it's nice to sit and read articles without going on the computer, there just wasn't enough content compared to what I can get online. Mine did not always load until later in the day, which would not be acceptable on a regular basis. If trying the trial I recommend checking each morning to see if it loads for you. I was not concerned about the photos so much in this edition, although I always enjoy them, because I can always do a quick look online for them while still reading the articles in the comfort of my favorite chair. But for the price I would expect more content, AND I just can't justify the price when I can read it for free online. I'd probably subscribe if the price were somewhere between $5-$7, but not $14."
4,Quite Impressed,"I've definitely noticed that a lot of things early NYT for Kindle adopters complained about have been remedied. I ordered the Sunday NYT yesterday for the $.75 single-issue price and was quite impressed. The articles had photos. There was a lot of content (including the Magazine, book reviews, classifieds, etc.)...more than I expected. I think one just has to concede that newspaper content for Kindle (like the Internet versions a decade ago) is evolving. I didn't expect as much Sunday content as I got for $.75, so I was pleasantly surprised. I don't expect to subscribe (I don't have the time to keep up with a daily paper), so I love the convenience of grabbing a virtual copy of the NYT on an as-needed basis from anywhere I might be. Well worth it!"
2,Not the poroduct that I expected,I expected that I would get the entire Times. There is only part of the articles and none of the advertisements. It is way too expensive for a part subscription.
2,major sections are missing,"The downloaded version does not provide access to the entire newspaper. Some sections like technology, style etc are not provided in the drop down menu tab. Why must one fiddle around searching for it. If data size is a constraint then provide a solution to customize the paper. Disappointing on the kindle fire."
2,Price increase makes this a bad deal,"I have had the Kindle version of the paper for a year or so and have enjoyed having it on the road. However, it is an extremely abridged version of the paper. So if you need some information like theater schedules, you need to use the free online version. Now that the NYT people have increased the price 50% for the Kindle version even I will stop getting it. Since I need to use the free online paper from time ti time anyway to get items missing from the kindle version, I might as well just go there and get the whole thing. This price increase not seem to make a lot of sense to me."
2,Price hike makes this not worth it.,"I like the kindle edition of the NY Times, I really do. I get it whether I'm at home or on vacation, I don't have a lot of papers lying around the kitchen taking up space, and I can take it with me on mass transit without lugging something huge around. And I love reading this sort of medium-length content on my kindle screen.BUT...the price hike (from thirteen ninety-nine to nineteen ninety-nine) makes the price way too high, especially for something I can read on my iphone for free. It's not quite as nice an experience, but the difference isn't worth 19.99. I might subscribe to a cheaper local paper, though...sigh. I want to have the NY Times, but it's just not worth it. I have a feeling that the NY Times is just trying to kill off electronic editions, to preserve the paper edition. Good luck with that..."
2,Just too much!,First it was $11 then $14 now it going to $19. Time to move on. Wash Post here I come.
2,improvement needed,"Big issues. Can't access all sections of the paper. For example, the Technology section is not in the kindle version. Doesn't include access to nytimes.com and for the price, it should."
2,A STRIPPED DOWN VERSION OF THE NEWSPAPER,This paid subscription in many ways is less satisfactory than the experience I was getting from the FREE NYT app on my iPod touch. My main complaint is the lack of editing functions like cutting and pasting and especially no way to email an article...except by going to the main website which does allow sharing an article via email. Also very disappointed by the scarcity of photos. Otherwise a pleasant reading experience but I was expecting a FULL SERVICE subscription for my money. I will probably go back to the Ipod free app if the editing functions aren't restored in a reasonable amount of time.
2,Incomplete,"I have been getting notification on my computer of NYT headlines for some years (and then I can view the entire article and others), so I thought I would try the Kindle edition.Pluses: downloads to Kindle automatically; it's there each morning; it's easy to read successive articles, and easy to skip ahead or back to the next article.Minuses: virtually no photos and no graphs/maps; missing the tech and other regular sections; missing the crossword (okay, maybe not important); expensive at $20 per month.While nothing is as good as the physical newspaper, I think the NYT Company could have done a better job with this Kindle edition."
2,NYTimes for Kindle - Disappointing,I recently tried the NYTimes for Kindle but I am pretty disappointed thus far. The cost is $19.99/month however I already have a NYTimes monthly subscription for the weekends and online. This does not make much sense to pay both subscriptions so I will not renew my kindle edition once the 60 day free trial ends. Another major issue is the fact that the Kindle edition does not include headlines. This means that I must scroll through every article in each section. This is a pain.I hope that both issues will be fixed soon. I love the NYTimes and would rather read off my Kindle so hopefully things will improve soon.Seth
2,Book Review Section Incomplete,"I bought the Sunday NYT for the book review section. This Sunday, December 12, 2010, the lead article is Choosing the 10 Best Books and boy did I feel like I had struck gold. It starts out ""This week we present our 10 Best Books of the Year..."" followed by a couple of paragraphs of introduction and then it ends. There was not even a list of the books. Most disappointing."
2,missing article,"There are differences between internet edition and kindle edition. I read all articles yesterday, then I saw another journal, quoting an article in internet edition of NYTimes, I checked it out and the quoted article was in internet edition but it was not published in kindle edition. It hurts its reliability. I think I'll not continue my subscribtion after the free trial period."
1,"Good paper, Bad price. I'm out!","Dear New York Times, Thanks for pricing yourself out of my market!Good paper, but they keep increasing their Kindle price and at $19.99/month I will be canceling when the price hike goes into effect.I don't live anywhere near New York and I don't have to have the paper; I just enjoyed reading about world events. I will find a new less expensive and probably free news source! See ya!"
3,Ureliable,Even with a full battery there are days when the NYT does not arrive at my Kindle. Yet I am still being charged on my credit card the full amount of the subscription.
3,"good rendition, erratic paging","This review is not about the content, but the form. The content is the NY Times, my favorite newspaper (which gets 4 stars in my book).The kindle edition leaves out a few things. The only thing I miss is the best seller list in the Sunday Book Review. But that will be personal. Most of the articles are here. I would give it 4 stars except...There is a problem, page flipping often fails. It regularly goes from the first page of one article to the second page of a different article when I touch the right side of the screen. Often pressing next page will bring me to the correct page, but sometimes not. This is very annoying.Don't know if this is the times problem or a kindle bug (BTW, I have a paper white kindle).At first I thought I was using it wrong, but then I thought about it, there is no reason anyone would want to jump into the middle of another article."
3,Please lower price,"Despite its American establishment bias, NYT content is very informative and comprehensive. I do think, however, that the price is too high. For Canadian Kindle subscribers, the current monthly cost is US $27.99, which is $8.00 higher than rate offerred to American subscribers. Why the big discrepancy? NYT would greatly increase their electronic subscriber base if they lowered the Kindle price to $15 a month for everyone. Surely the electronic distribution costs must be much lower than the hard-copy distribution costs.Unlike other readers, I don't mind that some articles are omitted. During my Kindle trial subscription, I was quite satisfied with coverage of American and international issues. Nonetheless, I just wish they would open up the paper to anti-establishment writers (e.g. Noam Chomsky, Robert Fisk, Nomi Prins, Norman Finkelstein, Tariq Ali, Bruce Cumings, etc.). It would make the paper so much more interesting."
1,".....booo, get with it!!","You lost me at $20.00 a month, come on NYT thats just greed!!!You could at least offer a weekend sub. for the Kindle"
3,Looking for Objectivity,"I have always liked the NYTimes but am considering not renewing my subscription. I find the ""news"" accounts sometimes so obviously slanted to the progressive side that the news becomes less informative and more argumentative. I can understand that on the editorial pages but not in the reporting. Please just give us the facts and circumstances and let us make up our own minds about the politics and implications. Give the readers the benefit of the doubt in that we really do think and do not need to be led to conclusions."
1,Just too expensive when I out of a job.,I can't afford it. Used to read Chicago Trib daily. Cut back to 3 day a week. So I will keep looking for a good low cost/free Kindle solution.
1,Love the Kindle - Hate the New York Times,The Times used to be a respected newspaper but no more. If you care about fair and balanced reporting then stay away from the New York Times.
1,NYT Sucks,"Regardless of the format, NYT SUCKS. This isn't any real newspaper. It's Leftist propaganda that would make Pravda blush. I wouldn't allow it on my Kindle if they paid ME the $13.99 a month."
1,how do u stop the subscription : from a desperate house wife who doesnt want to pay the price for a subscripton,i mean i sighned up for a 14 day free trial because i love the news paper but i dont know how to stop the subscription so if anyone who reads this and knows how to do it i ask you to please write a review telling me how to do it i would much apreciate it
1,Twenty dollars monthly price?,"Oh it's like buying a new cell phone plan, only it's media content. I guess there's not much of that around?"
1,No thanks,"I can do without the left-wing rhetoric. I am just interested in straight news, but thanks anyway. Not for me."
2,Too Expensive and Pesky DRM,"This is it, the big kahuna of newspapers delivered right to your Kindle. You do not even need to get out of bed or off the throne to retrieve a soggy paper version from your snowed in yard.Just read it right there on your beloved Kindle.The problem is the high price for what you get and the pesky DRM content that you have to put up with.All the Kindle content is like this. This is the evil DRM inherent in the Kindle. It only lets you view the content on the Kindle. No printing articles, no emailing articles to a friend, no using it in presentations. You are stuck. Very evil is it not !So, if you can live with the price and restrictions of DRM then go for it my friend."
2,Good read...too slow of a delivery,"Like the ""paper, but always seems to be delivered one or two days after the paper is on the rack. No need for yesterdays news in my world.Emile"
1,No way! Not even close to actual paper for content,"Let's start by saying that this is just NOT the same as the daily paper's content.It isn't.You don't get:1. Crosswords2. Box scores3. Letters to Editor4. Classifieds5. Full articles in any section (you get some, not all).So I take offense to the suggestion that this is a savings. It's not. It's a different product and twenty a month is not worth it for me; it's not even close.I'd do 12 a month probably, but otherwise, no sale."
4,Fantastic BUT way too costly,Just an awesome kilndle paper. The content cannot be beaten. Great writing and all around coverage of the news. Just way too costly at $20.00 per month. $5 more than the next costliest paper. I wanted to continue my subscription but there are way too many other papers out there from $6 to $10 per month. Would give it 5 stars but for the cost.
3,Way too expensive,"I subscribed basically because I have trouble reading the low contrast type of the print edition (grey letters on lighter grey paper). The letters on the Kindle are nice and black against a white background, and the font size can be changed at will. What a pleasure! But I'm going to have to be pretty thrilled to keep paying the $19.99/month, especially since I already pay for the Sunday print edition."
2,I am disappointed with the abbreviated content.,"It killed me when the Seattle PI closed. I love the NYT too, but where we live we can't get daily delivery that's reliable (USPS). I bought my Kindle 2 thinking that for $14 I would be getting the whole NYT. Not true. I'm just a couple of days into my trial subscription and it's just a shell of a paper. Someone asked how I liked it. I told them it was the TV version of a newspaper. They show you what they think you want to read. One of the things I like about a print newspaper is that you may not want to read everything, but at least you have a choice. I'm going to cancel this trial and try the WSJ. But, I dislike their opinions about as much as I dislike the Seattle Times.I really thought this was such an efficient way to do a newspaper that I'd get everything ads and all. What a disappointment."
2,Just the basics,Only the pictures of lead articles are available (no diagrams or charts either). After the lead articles in each section there is no synopsis included after the title. Well and good except that the title is often insufficient to determine if the article is of interest. I would be much happier if these were available on the kindle version as they are on the NYT web site.
1,Too Expensive,"I can get more content from the NYTimes online for free. Paying more for less, now that's not a very good model."
2,uncertain,"The missing content is very disappointing. I subscribed to the Kindle version when NYT began requiring a subscription to their full web version. I prefer reading the Kindle over a PC.I am very pleased with what I can read and I am reading more of the paper. But, the missing articles, content, and truncated pieces leads me to consider dropping the subscription.I do not understand why all of the text cannot be delivered. If this were corrected, this would be an outstanding product."
2,"Not enough content, price too high","After reading the reviews for this subscription, I was doubtful about wanting to pay for it, but gave it a shot since it came with a free 14 day trial. I canceled the free trial after 2 days, because I found it so useless. At least half of the sections present on the nytimes website are missing, the most glaring omission was the technology section, which I particularly enjoy.I also feel that the price is far too high, especially considering the missing content. If all of the content were included, it might be close to worth it, but even then $20 is a lot, especially considering that article on the website are free. I find it much more useful to copy and paste some articles that interest me into a text document and transfer it to the kindle. It's a little more work, but worth saving $20 a month."
1,"$13.99 mo., REALLY?","I just got my Kindle...love it! I was shocked to see that the price is so high. I have subscribed to NYT via computer for years. They used to charge for it, but it is now FREE, so why is it so much via Kindle. I can see a nominal fee for the transmit, but $14mo. Yikes! I'll stick to my free subscription, thank you."
1,Price is CRAZY!,"The price increase to $19.99 is nuts. The digital version is a subset of the print edition, it was too expensive at $14.99. This price increase makes this subscription just ridiculous. I have had the NYT and Wall Street Journal on my Kindle for some time and read them both almost every day. I'm going to cancel the NYT, keep the Journal and look for another paper that is more reasonably priced. Somebody over at the NY Times needs to wake up."
1,Loss of a long standing NYT reader,"I've subscribed to the NYT for 25 years in the paper version. Having purchased a Kindle primarily for reading the Times, I love the accessibility--plus, even though I recycle, there is less paper in the landfill. And, though others have been concerned regarding the content, I have found that for the most part, the Kindle edition is very similar to the paper one.However, as others have already stated, a 40% increase is ridiculous. Certainly it is cheaper than home delivery, but I just spent $250.00 six months ago for the Kindle and don't want to return to a paper newspaper. So, like many others, I will be canceling my subscription when the price increases. Hopefully there is another quality newspaper that I can find.To the Times: consider a Monday-Friday edition, along with a stand along Sunday paper."
1,Delivery is poor,The download is very inconsistent. Many times the paper does not come for a few days. Because of this I am cancelling my subscription.
1,A Feeble Facsimile,"No illustrations charts or diagrams and only a few token photographs to demonstrate that they are possible. Missing or truncated articles. I find myself going to the NY times online edition to make sense of the omissions on the Kindle edition. What's the point of paying $14 a month when you get more online for free? I don't know who is responsible; Amazon, NY Times, or Sprint. In any case this is a bizarre and useless product."
3,No Technology Section,I think it is bizarrely ironic that the Technology section of the NYT is not included in the Kindle edition. What the what??
1,Of no use uless you take full subscription,"For two years now, we have been downloading and reading the sunday NYT on keyboard kindles. It alone is better than a weekly magazine. I was looking foward to the improved version on a kindle fire. However, on Fires, there appears to not be any way of purchasing/getting individual editions. The apps only works for current subscriptions. Other magaines now do this too. I guess they want you to buy full subscriptions. I can not possibly use (or afford) a full subscription, so its back to the Kindle keyboard for NYT."
4,NY Times is a great newspaper,"As far as content, I think the NY Times is one of the best in the country. I only purchase the Sunday edition. The price is great when compared to the paper edition at the store. Since I don't live near NYC, I don't care that the advertising is gone. The color pictures look great on my Kindle Fire HD. However, there are no wedding pictures on the Fire HD, but they did appear on my black & white Kindle."
4,times is always good,the Kindle is an easy more organized way to read the Times. But one missed the ads and the listings of best selling books on Sundays and I don't know what else. Also unlike the paper Times one cannot share it - even with other Kindle readers in your sharing group
4,Keeping In Touch,Nothing like the NY Times while I am over seas....Love it on Sundays... I do this at least once a weelk
5,Great option for travel,The Kindle version of the NYT is a great alternative when you are traveling. It is almost as good as the real thing and only 75 cents even on Sunday!
1,Skipped the headline news???,"I've been a print NYTs subscriber for 15 years and switched to the kindle edition a year ago. It's not been perfect, but it's been ""good enough"" until I was horrified to see that the kindle edition for March 21, 2012 had NO news whatsoever on the Mexican earthquake. I was in California and saw that the LA Times and the Wall Street Journal in print both had the earthquake as headlines. I didn't see the NYTs print version so I'm not sure if this was just a kindle problem or not. However, the earthquake had happened during the day on March 20th, so there was plenty of time to put in SOME sort of article about it. I am so discouraged by this particular oversight, and am now wondering what else I am missing. Thinking of canceling and switching to the Wall Street Journal ..."
2,just give me that days stories,It annoys me that the same stories are repeated in subsequent day papers. I do not zed that in print and should not in kindle version.
2,Not complete content,I love the New York Times it is the best newspaper in this country but for the price I pay for the kindle version i want it to have all the sections and pictures i see in the actual newpaper I will continue to buy the Sunday kindle version but that is it until content is complete
2,Less than expected,"The current issue when purchased here in Asia is a happy opportunity for those of us accustomed to reading it hot off the presses in the city; however, it is somewhat disappointing in several respects. Although sold by Amazon as ""current,"" it is not as current as one could wish with the coverage of ""breaking"" events at least two days old. Also the inclusion of the Texas Times articles, while sometimes of mild interest, are more a convenience for the publisher, one suspects, than an enhancement of the New York Times itself."
2,Why extra 8.00 dollars for int'l subscription?,"Many people are complaining $19.99 NYT monthly subscription is overpriced. However, paying for reading kindle NYT in a foreign country is more expensive. Amazon may say that it includes free international wireless delivery via Amazon Whispernet. Well, I have a 3rd 3G kindle. But I have been using my kindle only for wifi networks in my office and home. Thus the Whispernet never works for me. Yet another extra $8.00 for this, which I have never used? Over the Internet, there is no difference between domestic and foreign environment. Especially just reading newspapers! So I do hope amazon will provide $19.00 NYT subscription for foreign readers who only use their wifi networks. Also I wish amazon and NYT will provide lower subscription for people who pay their subscription fee in advance, such as half a year or year."
3,can you no longer purchase a single issue?,"perhaps there were too many single streams for the server, but the Purchase Current Copy choice was not available."
3,unavailable overseas?,"I got the NYTimes for my new Kindle specifically because I was traveling to Australia and New Zealand and wanted to access it. I was surprised to find that it never updated after I left the US. I just spent 20 minutes trying to figure out how to cancel the subscription, and if it is there someplace it is well hidden. I liked reading it on the plane, really convenient, quiet, no bulk. Annoying to be unable to cancel it."
5,Todats NY Times LATE AGAIN,I dont know why my NY Times is not on my Kindle at least 2 or 3 o4 times each month Does anyone take responsibility for this Someone is asleep at the switch
2,Should be better,I have no problem with content but the app should be better. No bookmarking. No emailing/commenting. No ability to organize content based on interest. Many other options would be nice. This bare bones app needs some attention (especially at $20 a month).
2,Too expensive,Not willing to pay this price for partial news... NYT must lower the price or make the entire news copy available. If advertisements were included it would also be a added-value.
3,later than free content,"I like the whole idea, especially since I live in Hong Kong. People like me would represent a new revenue stream for NYT, but unfortunately it seems like their content is posted to Kindle about 6 to 7 hours after it is posted free online. So I end up reading it online instead. You have to wonder if it is a commercial decision to delay posting content to Kindle or just difficulties in production. If they can make kindle a premium service vs a delayed service it would definitely be more attractive. Would also be nice to get charts and pictures. Feels very much like an experiment or work in progress at the moment."
1,delivery unreliable,delivery used to be quick and reliable. lately it is a struggle to get my kindle to retrieve the paper. the dog was more reliable.
3,$9.99 Please,"UPDATE 2:Still, I only can pay nine dollars and ninety nine cents for it on the Kindle. Take it or leave it nytimes.UPDATE 1:I can read it for free on the web and the ipad and on [...]; so I am still only willing to pay nine dollars and ninety nine cents for it on the Kindle.ORIGINAL:Given that the kindle edition is missing a few things I am only willing to pay [...] for it."
4,new york times,just a note toagreed with the review that talks about pricint. the main reaon i will not subscribe is i get NYT alerts and free readings on my cell phone. a cheaper price and i would subscribe.
1,Where's the integrity?,"The NYT digital subscription is like the old roach motel - you can get in but you can't get out.First problem they hit your credit card every 28 days instead of once a month. Sneaky. After a while you have no idea when is the end of the billing cycle (which is when you want to cancel).Second, to cancel you have to call, on a telephone. WHY IS THAT??? Believe me, the wait is long, looong. When (if) they finally answer, the struggle begins.Third, the reps are such liars. Mine said, ""Sir, you are cutting out, I am going to have to hang up..."" and she did. I was calling on a land line! It was infuriating. What am I to think of that company's reporting truth if they have such little regard for it while talking to a person?The 99 record clubs of my teenage years had more integrity than the NYT!"
3,"Discount Subscriptions for Students, Educators, Seniors","The New York Times, for example, gives discounts for Students, Educators, Seniors when you subscribe to the print editions. I can't find whether there is a similar discount for the Kindle version. Is there? If not, why not?"
1,Way too pricey,"I like the NYT but it's free on-line...$9.99/month is too much for any paper and this one is $14/month. Granted you can tote your Kindle around easier than your laptop, but come on. It's waaaay over-priced for what you get."
2,poor service,where is my times. two days in a row there is no paper. i expect that i will be credited. if it continues i will cancel.
3,$$$$$?,$170 a year for the (partial) online version of a newspaper?I don't think so.I'll check back in a few months when there are more kindle titles and prices have come down ;-)
2,"Great product, but expensive","Would love to keep the NYT coming to my Kindle, but can't do it at this price. Needs to be 50% less imo."
3,"Overpriced - just get the ""Latest News"" blog","I have been reading the (free) AvantGo version of the NYT for years, so paying $14 a MONTH (that's $168 a year!) is a little much. Who has time to read the whole paper every day anyway? The blog has most of the articles from the front page, US, and International sections for a much more reasonable price. I'll switch back when they bring the price down to $5 or maybe $7 a month."
1,"GOOD-BYE WSJ, and HELLO FT!","I have just bought my Kindle 2, partially to get the WSJ subscription. I used to subscribe to the paper edition, but despite of only living from 10 miles of NYC delivery of the paper was terrible.I was impressed with my Kindle reader and I thought paying 9.99 for the WSJ was a good compromise. Although the navigation was a little bit cumbersome, I have found most of the content, and the whispernet delivery was great.As I just started my trial subscription I have found out that the price went up by 50%. I am hugely disappointed, and as soon as my 2-weeks trial is over I will be canceling my subscription. Although I have loved the WSJ, this price just does not make sense. So GOOD-BYE WSJ, and HELLO FT!I am disappointed with Amazon too, the pricing structure of its products just seem to be too unpredictable.I thought I was going to be a life-long Kindle reader, but I am not so sure of that anymore."
2,missing articles,"Today's Sunday NY Times on Kindle review: It is easy to read, but lacking many of the articles. It's only $0.99 and not worth the cost for a partial newspaper."
3,"Nice, but too expensive","I have subscribed to the adobe online version with full color, which I love, but stopped it because it was just too expensive. This kindle version is pretty nice, but it too is much too expensive. I will cancel at the end of my trial. If it were say, 9.99 I might keep it up, but at 19.99 I cannot justify it."
2,"I WANTED to love the NYT on my Kindle, but...","It was always a day, sometimes two days late. That was very annoying. I ended up canceling it as I hate ""day-before-yesterday"" news. Too bad, I loved the idea. Might go back when the execution is better."
1,what time do i get today's paper?,"i thought the n.y. times was a morning daily. i'm on the west coast. in new york, it's nearly noon. i haven't received today's paper yet. i left wireless on all night, and have been reading other kindle content all morning. is this standard?"
3,Where Are The Box Scores,One big downside of the Kindle edition is that it doesn't have the box scores.
4,Reacting to electronic format,Having not previously subscribed to paper copy I had no expectations and with experiences with electronic version of Newsweek am delighted. Old habits with regional paper in serious decline add to my motivation. Finding I read more thoroughly rather than skimming.
3,Needs more National Content,"While I do enjoy what is offered in the Kindle version of the NY Times, I find it lacking in the number of stories, both Front Page and National. Also, the price is sort of high considering this is a digital format which costs them much less to provide."
2,Too expensive for an abbreviated version,"I just got my Kindle a week or two ago and I really like it. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the NYT on the Kindle. First of all, the subscription is too expensive, so I will cancel my trial subscription. The Kindle version seems to have all of the major stories, and it is easy to browse around, but for $15 per month, it is simply too expensive. The content certainly is not exclusive, and most of the time I just check out the NYT on the Internet. The kindle is more convenient in the morning while drinking coffee, etc.... but for $15? Come on! If they dropped the price to about $5 per month, I would subscribe for life. But $15 is just too much."
4,News,You want news? you'll find them here. And with Kidle it is easy to zoom out and still have all the page in one wondow. It is an enjoy.
1,3 months old,it has been 3 months and i can not delete this newspaper. i wish the price would go down. i dont use this newspaper anymore.
2,Missing Articles,"The Kindle Edition is pretty good, except that you don't get the full paper. Its frustrating - I don't want to be frustrated by my newspaper.For example, the cover story for the magazine was missing last Sunday, a great article about the GOP's use of technology, something that would be interesting to many people who read news on an electronic device. But someone decided that the only way to read that article was on the dead tree version. Weird.And we wonder why newspapers are failing?"
5,Excellent In-Depth Reporting,This is one of the world's great newspapers. The liberal bias in the reporting is not as intrusive as many people claim it to be. The science times is always worth buying (Tuesday).
1,What would someone pay so much for an epaper when one can access for free on the Internet?,I don't get it? I can read the New York Times and numerous other papers online for free. Why would I pay $20/month for the New York Times on the kindle?
1,Wanted to love it,Wanted to love the NYT on my Kindle. The economics and greeness made me really want to love it. Just couldnt do it. I need the dirty fingers and the crossword
1,$14 kindle vs. $0 web,Throw in some ads and charge me a nominal fee($3.99/mo maybe). I'd rather spend the $14/month on 2 Kindle books. Newspapers should make their money on ads not subscription fees.
3,News that fit to print,Very good app for poeple on the go.Helps you keep up with what's happening now in a forever moving world.
1,Dear NY Times:,"Honestly, what are you doing? $13.99/month for a digital newspaper? You have cut all costs associated with print and delivery, and I do not even receive the benefit of the entire paper (the crossword as one example). It is no surprise - although it is a shame - your paper has financial issues. Consider allowing a person that actually wants this medium to work to run your digital deptartment. Good luck in the future."
3,Coudn't get used to the format,"I really did try. But I miss the photo, the crossword, national weather map, and miss holding the paper. I do love my Kindle for books, but until the NYT goes out of business I will continue to buy the paper version."
3,"Not as good as their ""Skimmer""","The web app ""Times Skimmer"" is much more complete and gives quick access to the entire paper. Unfortunately the NYTimes blocks Kindle access to the website so I guess they can charge more for less. I only purchased a single edition to see if it had improved ... it hadn't."
3,Crossword,Try as I might I just can't find the crossword puzzle. It isn't really the New York Times without one. What's up with that?
5,It's expensive but...,"It's the highest priced newspaper. I don't like that part. But I love the coverage and the in-depth reporting. So instead of thinking about $20/month or $240/year, I'm reminding myself that it's the best news coverage I've found for less than $1 a day.I agree with the reviewer below who said that full access to the online site should be included with the price, especially since it's being offered for iPad subscribers. Maybe we're next?"
1,impossible to cancel,"look, its the times. its good, but it's not worth $20 a month and the trial turns into a non cancelable trap. here I am, 30 minutes into trying to cancel and am paying $20/month because the trial period lapsed as I kept putting off canceling because it was so difficult to cancel. - I think they made this practice illegal with paper magazines."
2,Still too expensive,"At $13.99, it's simply too expensive. Now, is $14/month going to break me? No. However, add two or three newspapers, four or five magazines, and 2-3 books and before you know it, you're at $100/month.Too much."
4,Pretty good,For the price this is a great way to read the paper but it takes me almost twice as long as normal to read an article. It is however an extremely conveniant way to read on the go.
1,I loath the NYT,"Loath it, yes loath it i said. Don't believe everything you read, you must do your do diligence and get the whole picture."
2,iPad?,"I'm trying to replace my kindle with my new iPad and this isn't available with it. Sure seems like they are missing out on a huge potential audience, myself included."
1,New York Times = Un-journalism,"This is the worst pile of biased, un-journalism I have ever read. What a complete was of time and energy. Shock journalism. No integrity at all when you need to print more retractions that actual news stories every day.Papers are dying, and the only thing the NYT can think of is to print lies as to shock unsuspecting citizens into reading their garbage columnists. Stay away, at all costs - unless you like to be blindly misled."
3,Not willing to pay for partial NYT,"I'm considering purchasing this device, but won't be subscribing to the NYT. I can't see the reason to subscribe to a subset of the newspaper."
3,C'mon....,"My sole reason for wanting a Kindle is to read the New York Times while I commute. If the Kindle Times is incomplete, that kills it for me.....NY Times, wake up and smell the coffee. I will wait to see if the Times corrects this. I'll bet there are many others doing the same. (We need our Science, Health, crossword and Ken Ken!)"
2,"Was great, until iPad-induced price hike","Great paper, great content, but totally unjustified price hike from 13.99/mo to 19.99. This fell in line with publishers renegotiating with amazon over deals with apple and iPad content, but the content on the kindle remains EXACTLY THE SAME as at the old price. No new features, no new content, no new interactivity, yet I'm paying an iPad price. I'll be canceling when my grandfathered-in 13.99 rate expires.** Update **Just cancelled the paper. Even with the grandfathered grace period, this forced me to look at other options for getting the news. NYT: Fix this pricing mistake before it's too late!"
2,Was skeptical at $13 a month $20 a month is laughable,I am not happy that the New York Times has decided to force Kindle users to subsidize the Ipad version of it's free paper. The Ipad version is far superior to the Kindle version. The Kindle version is barely acceptable but $20 a month it is ridiculous.
2,"Removed Android accessibility, removed my use for it","I was perfectly satisfied with the newspaper itself, and would have gladly paid $20 per month for it from here on out, until one day I attempted to open the paper on my Droid only to find out that accessibility on Android had been suddenly shut off. While I have a Kindle, I always have my phone with me, and enjoyed reading the articles on both while commuting and in downtime. It's no longer worth it. If they bring back Android accessibility, I'm on board."
1,When the product is ready I will buy it,"I buy books monthly, I would like to buy & read even more, and reading 2-3 newspapers daily you would think the Kindle is the perfect match; but it is not.I check the Kindle every month waiting to see full content of the 3-4 newspapers I would like to subscribe (NYT, WAS, USA, WP) but none offer full content.Still not buying."
2,Subscriptions are very inconsistent compared to a day by day download,"I used to download the NYT 2-3 times a week to read with my morning coffee at Starbucks. I figured a subscription would be cheaper so I signed up. The subscription version rarely downloads in the morning and often downloadas a day late. When I bought it day by day, it downloaded within a minute. Stay away from the subscription. As for those reviews complaining about missing editorial content, c'est la vie. The NYT is a much better paper than either local paper here, especially on world news. Additionally, reading the NYT on Kindle is not only cheaper, but better, imho, than the paper edition. With the Kindle you start the article and there is no turning of pages or going to other sections to continue the story. What you may lose in content you gain in ease of reading."
2,No Front Page,"I really have been disappointed with the New York Times for the Kindle. It lacks the iconic front page of the New York Times and starts off with the first article. It's just not the same thing, even the iPhone app is better designed.The DX is begging for a beautifully designed front page for a newspaper, so let's see it."
1,Fatal flaws,"1. I'm on day 2 of my trial, it's 7:30 on the West Coast and the paper hasn't downloaded yet.2. On principal, as a print subscriber which supposidly includes all digital subscriptions, I shouldn't have to purchase a seperate subscription for my Kindle Fire. An iPhone is included, an iPad is included, but not the Kindle Fire.3. The Fire edition doesn't include all of the content of the print edition."
2,"Come on, waiting 3 months for promised website access","I am generally pleased with the Kindle subscription to the NY times but some articles are missing and, just as maddening, some articles were cut short in the Kindle edition, so access to the website is important. It was promised on March 29th, it's June. Come on, how hard is it to verify with Amazon that I have a kindle account? Don't promise and then not deliver, better to just keep your mouth shut."
4,Good content,Can't question the content and Whispernet is perfect for the traveler to start the day with the morning's paper. Was expecting the cost of the digital version to be lower.
4,Good value,I like being able to buy a paper and read it thoroughly before purchasing another. I like The New York Times because I get good articles over a range of subjects both national and international.
1,new kindle format not acceptable,I do not like the new kindle format for the times at all . I will no longer be buying it . It worked before why change it ?
2,Kindle Times,Poor layout. The Kindle version is inferior to the PC version. It lacks looks and ease of reading available of digital offerings such as Newsweek.
4,For those interested in farming or tractors,"Takes you through the process a farmer goes through from preparing the land, planting, harvesting, to boxing the product and placing it in trucks for transport to the grocery store. Strong emphasis on where big tractors fit into these processes.Any young child (2-7) who lives on a farm, and many others that don't will like this video. It's can stand up as an instructional video, or simply as a moving picture book of various tractors -- whatever your child prefers. My four year old boy likes this video a great deal, and he doesn't live on a farm.Runs about 30 minutes; video quality is good, not great."
3,No Attachment to Characters,This book was something that I didn't feel attached to the characters as I do the ones I do in the Dear America series.To me the character Virginia never really changed throughout the story. Maybe that is why the story is more then one part. She seems to try and change but instead just whines through the book.The way it was written did not seem to connect to me as a reader. Yes the little girl is writing to amuse herself as her brother taught her but it should be a flowing story as well. I just do not feel that it did flow freely as it should.In the end I just felt it was a generic version of the Dear America series.
3,A Short History of Western Philosophy,"The contents of the book is too short. Buy the bigger books by the same author, vol. 1 and 2."
5,One of the best first generation playstation games,I first found this game as a rental back when the PS first hit shelves and I found it was more in depth story wise than many of the others at the time. While it looks very dated by the current standards it was a really fun game and was very challenging. It was hard to find for a while in used game stores and I've only seen a few. If you're into old PS gaming i suggest this and x-com.
2,Disturbing image ruins it,"This book may be well-written enough, but one thing keeps me from ever recommending it to children. There is a picture in this book with a racoon in the foreground and a masked surgeon in the background looking at the raccoon while holding up a knife. The raccoon is in clear focus and looks very sad. The caption for the picture reads ""To test this raccoon for rabies, a researcher prepares to remove some of the animals brain tissue."" I just don't see any reason why this picture should be in this book. It's fine to talk about it since it relates to the brain, but why should we have an illustration of a raccoon who is about to get his brain cut open? Children may be very upset by this image."
2,"pretty clock, ugly chime","I bought this clock to replace what appeared to be its predecessor from Seth Thomas, which I received as a gift 11 years ago. The older one had stopped working, but once upon a time, it had an hourly strike and quarter-hour chime. This new clock has neither - its only audible feature is an hourly chime - and it sounds like a cheap doorbell. We hate it. The clock looks really pretty, but if you're looking for an appealing, old-fashioned chime and strike, you'll have to pay more for a better clock."
3,Nice Clock,The clock is very nice. The chimes are a bit lame sounding and they have no volume control. You must choose to hear them at full blast or not at all.
1,Not as described,"Okay, so I have found customer reviews extremely helpful in making selections and typically review them carefully. I guess this time, I somehow didn't read the reviews because the clock definitely does not function as the description states. While I don't agree the chimes are obnoxious, they are very loud and there is not a volume control. What really irks me is the description specifically states the chimes will automatically stop overnight. They don't. The only way to stop the chimes at night is to manually turn them off, then turn them on again each morning. On top of this, the clock this morning has decided to chime every minute rather than every hour. Boy did it get turned off in a hurry. This clock is definitely going back!"
5,A perfect gift!,The seller was very professional and shipped in a timely manner. The product was new in the box at an excelent price. My wife was very happy with the choice.
4,"Beautiful watch, but. . .","I bought the Movado Moderna because I had seen one displayed in a retail store and thought it had such a striking look. And don't get me wrong, the watch face is beautiful, but the band is a piece of junk. I have had mine for a little over a month and only worn it a few times on dress up occasions and already the band is beginning to show signs of extreme stress. Now I wish I had spent the extra money and bought the same watch with a metallic band - which is probably what I will wind up doing when the band breaks - and it will break!"
3,Needs some improvement,"my one year old son loved this toy in the store. The music had him dancing and the giggle made him laugh. I think it's a great toy except for that it runs out of battery VERY quickly. This might be the reason for the previous reviewer saying it wasn't loud enough. It runs on 3 button batteries which are hard to get in and out of the toy and they only last about a week tops. As for the ""pop"" being bad for your heart I think that sounds just plain ridiculous. There is way more ""pop"" in lots of other toys like the jack-in-the-box. I honestly don't see how this toy would cause health problems. All in all not a bad toy but, as I said earlier, it needs different batteries that last longer."
2,Be prepared to spend $$$$ on batteries,"This is a cute toy, and our kids like it. But it takes button photo batteries that don't last long and are EXPENSIVE! It'll cost you almost as much as the toy is worth to replace the batteries just once."
3,Dirty Merchandise,"I bought this for my niece for X-mas. She loves the toy, however, it was filthy. It needed to be washed before she could play with it. Something that shouldn't happen when something is bought new."
2,"Well, its ok, but its not that loud","I bought this for my son, not from TRU but from a shop on Main street. My son never really was interested it b/c it was so low in sound that it wouldn't keep his attention. I'm not sure if it was the product or the place i purchased it, but I do think it should have been at least a little louder!"
3,pops too soon,"i would not reccomend putting this in front of someone who has heart problems because the ""pop"" feature really works"
3,Village by the Sea,"This is a story of a poor Indian family who are being torn apart by illness and alcohol. The children of the family work and fight to keep there family together. On the way they have to deal with change and tragedy. This book had a typical ending which is very easy to predict, and had no real surprises. However the characters in the book where strong and determined, they keep the reader reading by the way they got through life on so little. The book shows that if you want something bad enough it is possible to get it."
3,The Village By The Sea,"This book, amongst the many i have read, is outstanding in the way it creates the scenes and imagery in our minds. Allthough i am not familiar with the works of Anita Desai, i was impressed with the quality and degree of potential this book produces. Village By The Sea takes us through a journey of a small town in india adjusting to modernisation and the introduction of factories and industrilisation. They also deal with the major factor of poverty which is illustrated to us superbly. Allthough this is not the best book i have read, i strongly reccomend this to anyone who has spare time to read an informative yet enjoyable book!"
4,A vivid book - about how to move on,"This book is a vivid story, about how happiness can flourish even among the poorest of people. The children in this family are not only struggling to survive, they are trying to be happy at the same time by adapting to the new things that come into their lives. Life is truly a rollercoaster - it has its ups and downs but this novel shows that there is always some way out of misery. The contrasts between city- and countrylife is also very vividly described by the author, she has captured the spirit of Bombay, India, in captivating words."
4,"Great Knife, but...","The Kershaw Whirlwind Folding Knife by Ken Onion is a great knife and a great EDC in most situations. I have carried my Kershaw Whirlwind every day that I have worn jeans for the past 3 years, but when on occasion I ware dress pants this knife is just too heavy. That is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 stars.It is very sharp out of the box and will hold an edge with very little maintenance.I love the ability to open it with one hand and it has a good feel in my hand.A great looking knife also!!"
5,Sheppard Method: Best of the Best,"Risa Sheppard's Method of Pilates is by far the best interpretation of Joseph Pilates' system. This DVD is simple, easy to follow and gives me the best results with minimum stress--and no pain! For those who hate stressful gymnastics and other not-so-gentle forms of exercize, this DVD is for you."
2,Maybe It Will Work for Another Purpose,It wasn't what I expected although that is probably my fault for not understanding the purpose. I was hoping to use it for myTOPS group and I will have to see what I can do with it.
5,Great idea,"This is just what I needed to get me off the couch. When I opened the box, I loved how they thought of everything to create a friendly competition over 8 weeks. If you need more games, Amazon also sells them.The Fitness Challenge Board Game"
5,Really got us moving,"My husband and I were trying to get in an exercise habit, but it just wasn't happening. We had our first child last May and made excuse after excuse. Finally, with us being so competative (in a fun way), I looked online for motivational/fun ways to get ourselves to commit. I found this game and convinced my husband. I think he was a little unsure but after we started (and had some fun trash talk) we realized how effective it was for us. The days we would have skipped in the past (weekends, after work), we wouldn't because we would want another star. We have been averaging 7 points per week and have sooo much more energy. We both have a ways to go but at least with this new habit we know we will get there eventually!"
2,VERY used,"To say this CD was ""used"" is a gross understatement. The case came in 2 pieces and was split and cracked repeatedly. The other CDs that came in the box were fine."
2,Repeated broken shipments,"I ordered this as a gift for my nephew, and the product was broken when he received it. We returned it, received a new one that was also broken. A third try got us a broken one again. The only reason we kept it is because my nephew wants it. Hopefully, we can patch it successfully."
2,Too much plastic,"This is a disappointing kershaw knife. The black on black gives it a stylish and rugged look, but that's the only good thing about it. The handle is way too much plastic for my taste. It makes the knife feel cheap, and after a little wear it makes it look cheap. This knife didn't last me too long in my line of work. This knife is just a cheap tool, and not worth the money."
5,Great Knife.,"Got this knife on sale, ended up about $45. As I expected its a great knife, I've owned Kershaw knives before and have always been satisfied. Knife is extremely sharp, easy fast one hand opening. Great overall and great build. Would definitely recommend this knife."
5,Great Knife! Made in the USA!,The knife holds its edge well. Blade sturdy and tight. Opens like a charm. Comfortable handle. Removable belt clip and switchable thumb stud (for left or right handed opening). This knife is a quality product and I would recommend it to anyone.
5,Kershaw 1550 folder,"Awesome little knife, great gift idea for a soldier or outdoorsman/woman. Im currently deployed overseas Im sure this knife can handle anything."
5,Cool knife,"I bought this for my Dad and he loves it. The ""blackout"" feature is more stealthy looking and he likes it."
2,Does not provide helpful hints for coping.,"I was disappointed with this book. While it is an entertaining biography of Mr. Roberts' experiences as a teacher to the blind, it does not provide much useful information regarding how to cope with blindness. It does demonstrate that blindness can be overcome with proper training so that a blind person can live a ""normal"" life. Most of the examples sited are quite dated."
4,"Ummm, dark chocolate","Tasty, and satisfies my chocolate jones while having some nutritional value. A bit pricey, so I'll have to give them up when I retire."
4,The other flavors are better,I love this company but I don't love this bars flavor. The almond and dark chocolate ones are fantastic and I do recommend them. This one though (the pomegranite)has a unpleasant taste that gets a bit better as you get used to it but not worth buying again.
2,something important is missing,"This is a modest little biographical sketch of the turbulent life of Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. The details of his life are too sketchy to justify a really thorough biography. Granted. My problem with Prose's book is that too little attention is given to the paintings. There are a few paintings reproduced in small color plates, but even these are not analyzed properly. Big fans of Caravaggio will be disappointed to find that 'Supper at Emmaus' for example is missing entirely. Also missing is an annotated index of the artist's works. Equally reprehensible is the mention in the text of paintings that are not represented in the plates at all. An artist's legacy is not his life, but his work, and it is his work that should have received more attention in this volume."
3,"Well written, yet unsatisfying","I have recently visited Galleria Borghese where a few of Caravaggio's paintings are on display. I thoroughly enjoyed them; however, I wanted to gain some deeper insights into his paintings, so I purchased this book.Francine Prose's slim introduction to Caravaggio is, by and large, unsatisfying. Caravaggio's life is mostly unknown, and even the parts that are known are questionable. Naturally, I wasn't expecting a comprehensive account of his life. However, to my disappointment, too many pages of this slim book are given over to speculation about his life instead of focusing on his paintings. Moreover, most of the discussion on Caravaggio's paintings was too short, and oftentimes, was not accompanied with a picture of the discussed painting, making it fairly hard to follow. The author's writing is fluid and enjoyable, but, considering this book's flaws, I can't recommend it."
4,A good book.....,This was a good book because it made me curious about Caravaggio. I subsequently bought another book that was a much more thorough biography of Caravaggio.
1,Blames the victim,"I wish I would have read Lundy's book (Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men) or Evan's book (the Verbally Abusive Man; can he change) first. Those are excellent books. They explain how the angry and controlling man's mind works. This book teaches you how to stay in an abusive relationship and make the ""best"" out of the situation. These men are sick and need therapy. I've been in a marriage for over 6 years with a verbally abusive man. Understanding their thought process is the key to knowing whether to stay or go. This book in no way addresses their sense of entitlement. It doesn't address why they try to control. I feel like it still blames the victim. It blames the victim for taking the abuse to ""heart"", but unless you've lived through how vicious the abuse can be...not taking it to ""heart"" is easier said than done."
1,Not helpful at all... Please don't get this...,"I have read several books on verbally abusive relationships and I had to put this one down half way through, because like a previous reviewer stated it really does put too much blame on the victim. I would not recommend this book to anybody who is trying to get out of a verbally abusive relationship."
1,Couldn't read any more!,"I wish I had heeded the negative reviews here before buying. I've been in therapy for quite a long time, thank goodness, this helped me realize what a mess this book is. It's ending up in a recycling bin, ripped apart as I consider the views and advice (from the little I read) to be along the ""blame the victim"" lines and potentially dangerous. I recall the author(s) suggesting just not letting the abuse bother you, then things will change. I think this leaves readers/women who read this nonsense and take it seriously open to possible harm, as often abusers move from verbal to physical violence. Please don't buy this, check out the other one star reviews for other titles!"
4,Have not fully read it yet,but from what I have read its certainly gives insights that help one to deal with those occasional situations that are upsetting.
1,DO NOT READ THIS INSENSITIVE BOOK.,"An absolutely horrible book, I was sickened by its slant on stopping verbal abuse by behaving equally badly; it distorts the true pain of verbal abuse, and blames the recipient. I suspect it was written BY an abusive man. PLEASE AVOID THIS BOOK! I've been there, if you're hurting, my heart and love go out to you. If you suspect you're in an abusive marriage, MUCH BETTER BOOKS exist, including The Verbally Abusive Relationship: How to Recognize it and How to Respond -- by Patricia Evans, and Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men -- by Lundy Bancroft. When you see ""your relationship"" in black and white, you will suddenly see what he is doing to you, and it will be a relief to know you're not going crazy!"
3,Hard To See For Legally Blind,I bought this item for my legally blind mother in hopes she would be able to read the display. She could not. The contrast between the alphanumeric display and the background color is not great enough to make the numbers and letters pop. Even holding it up to her face she was unable to make out the display. The font style was a terrible choice also making it hard to read. It worked as advertised but the green background and black alphanumerics is a bad combination.
3,"Ok, but worked only 8 months","The backlight is 3 green LED's at the bottom of the screen, but they aren't bright. My message LED and new call LED did turn on (you must call Verizon to get the message data sent; it's off by default. Otherwise, message waiting won't turn on). The display's contrast is adjustable, and very readable after adjusting. The delete button sometimes did not pop out after use. About 30% of the time it will disconnect the call I'm on when a incoming call is displayed. It worked semi-OK, but I will not buy it again."
2,Leaves Phone Off Hook,"This caller ID is terrible. Really can't read it right, and it will about once a month somehow automatically leave your phone off hook until someone tells you about it. It may be days like me before you figure out that people are calling but you are not receiving the calls because of this unit... Complete junk."
4,Great Display,"Easy to connect, display is large and clear. Ability to display call waiting ID is a huge plus."
5,A great review of the Indiana state high school basketball tourney,"I have referred to this book many times when visitors want to know facts about the Indiana high school basketball tournament which started in 1911. Amazingly, the book gives box scores of state final games and other facts and figures that interested Hoosier basketball fans will cherish. Even attendance figures are included.I don't know how any Hoosier cannot have this book available to settle arguments and promote discussions about the basketball state. Norman Jones, Ed.D. author of Growing Up in Indiana: The Culture & Hoosier Hysteria Revisited"
5,Excellent bio of a great musician,"Beefheart's music remains one of the few experiences that has successfully remained as exciting today as when I first encountered it in 1969. There is nothing like his music, nothing like his voice, nothing like the Magic Band.Mike Barnes' book is an excellent introduction to the man, his music, and his times. For those who don't know his music, it will intrigue you enough to get an album or two, if not all of them (start with Trout Mask Replica, his greatest, and don't listen to anyone who says it's the least accessible: great music will always find a way into a receptive ear). And for those of us who love his music, Barnes' book will get us to drag out those lp's/cd's once again and listen to that glorious, joyous, extraordinary music.Highly reccommended reading."
3,A Fair Biography of a Great Artist,"Thorough and informative, but unfortunately Mike Barnes is only a mediocre writer. This is a must have for fans and, for that matter, anyone interested in the milestones of American music. But prepare yourself for a less-than-satisfying literary experience."
4,The Beefheart,"The two bios of Beefheart, ""Captain Beefheart"" by Mike Barnes, and ""Through the Eyes of Magic"" by John ""Drumbo"" French when combined, paint a pretty fascinating picture of a pretty wild dude. Good stuff..."
5,"Great,informative bio on the legend that is the Captain.","Brilliant.I hope the technology soon allows soundclips of relevant songs embedded in the text of an ebook about musical subjects.This would have increased my already huge enjoyment of this book by 100%.The man Beefheart was underrated and exploited,a musical phenomenon with a wide,never-repeated and ageless output."
4,Good Critical Analysis,"This is an exaustive account of Beefheart's musical legacy with a small portion of the book, covering the latter years when he just painted. Lots of interviews with ex-band members provide insightful commentary on his unorthodox method to writing music, and often dictatorial way of getting music from his musicians. The relationship with Frank Zappa, a childhood friend, is also covered here.There is still uncovered territory as to his personal life, as most of the attention is directed toward his albums and tours. Given Beefheart's tendency to privacy, that is no surprise. This book is recommended for both the novice Beefheart fan and the ultra afficionado."
4,The Captain's Log,"An amazing book. Beefheart comes across as tempremental, devious, perhaps even mad. The architypal 'Difficult Genius', in fact. The book contains very detailed descriptions of all the songs, most of which I was unfamiliar with, but that I now want to check out.The real heroes of the book are the many seemingly faceless musicians who were in the various line-ups of the Magic Band and who actually played his material. These dedicated men (and a couple of women) put up with the Captain's bizarre and gruelling recording methods in order to replicate the magic in his head onto record. That they mostly have only good things to day about him today is a testament to the high esteem in which they hold his art. And the author did a fine job in interviewing them and getting the most out of them story-wise. All in all, a very fine read."
3,Van Vliet's Harmonicats,"I like Captain Beefheart's music and painting. As with most significant rock and roll artists, just about everything that's ever been written about him is totally worthless. Lester Bangs did some good stuff and Langdon Winner's essay on ""Trout Mask Replica"" in a book of essays on desert -island records is excellent. There are a lot of tedious exegeses of Van Vliet's poetry and some decent analyses of his music here and there. This book is all right but lacks depth. For example, Van Vliet is married; who is his wife? Family? Barnes displays familiarity with the music, which is great. Lester Bangs was right thirty years ago: Beefheart is more important than the Beatles or even Dave Matthews. Although there are times I can't listen to it, his music makes everything else sound pretty lame. Anyway, the book is worth buying despite its faults, although it needs more pictures."
2,Heating Component is Worthless,"I don't know whether my car's cigarette lighter is somehow different from those in other cars, but it seemed to ""burn out"" the cord to my mug. The cord stopped working after only two weeks of use. They sent me a replacement, but it stopped working the very first time I used it! The mug looks great, and it does keep liquids reasonably warm, but the unique aspect -- the plug-in heating element -- was a complete failure for me."
1,Good Luck,I wrote this review earlier but I'm not sure it went through. I want to spare you the return shipment on this item. I tried 2 one lasted 3 weeks and one lasted 3 days.
2,"Some Good Things, but Too Many Bad Things","I got this set and 1 extra handset for a total of 3 phones. For the price, the voice quality just isn't there. It's not that it's terrible - just not as clear as my old 900 MHz phone. It also doesn't have the range that my old one did.There is also a ""Feature"" on this phone that will be the reason I send it back. When you have multiple handsets the phones only recognize that you answer a call on the handset you use. In other words, if you answer a call on one handset all the other handsets display that you missed the call. It doesn't know that you answered the call on the other handset. If you don't use a handset for a couple of days, you go to pick it up and it says you missed 15 calls... What? Oh... I just missed them on this handset. I called Panasonic and was told that this is a ""Feature"", and they could not change it.There are some nice things about the phone, but there are also some ""Features"" I can do without."
2,garbled,"Great phone if you are away from the base. If the base is located on a desk for example, your voice will be ""underwater"" on the handset untill you move at least 3 feet away or more. Panasonic is aware of the problem and they will repair or replace the defective phone...if you send it to them."
2,Disappointed,"Consumer Reports gave this phone system a good rating and based on that we made the purchase. Rarely have I ever experienced such problems with any electronics purchase. We've had the phone company out 3 times to check the line and 3 different service reps have said it's not the line. The reception (intermittently) is terrible. Tried reprogramming the handsets, changing the location of the base and switching the handsets to different chargers. Nothing works effectively. We really thought we were getting a quality phone system and this has just not been the case. My wife and I discussed sending it back to the manufacturer ... but then what do we do for a land line while they take there time in checking it out? It's better just to toss it when the next generation phone (from another manufacturer) proves itself worthy enough to take the loss."
1,Lousy,"Panasonic used to be one of the best electronics makers bar none. Now everything they make is extremely watered-down using the cheapest parts available and shoddy labor.I bought two of these phones based on the best buy salesman's recommendation and sure enough it was pure junk.The reception is terrible! People could not hear me whenever I got within 5 feet of the base. That is not something that should happen for $150 phone that is supposed to be ""state of the art."" My advice is buy the Uniden and you will be much happier."
2,Sound quality is garbled at times,We just purchase this phone over Christmas and the phone has some great features. But it fails at times in the most important feature a phone should have which is sound quality.At times the sound quality is so garbled that both parties can not understand each other. This occurs when standing within feet of the phone or in another section of the house.My old 900 DSS phone had better sound then this new phone system.I expect we will be returning the phone.
1,Not worth buying,I have had this phone system with two handsets for over 6 months. The sound quality is horrible. All my callers complain about it. The display on one handset already does not work.I am very disappointed in this phone system. I have always had a very high opinion of Panasonic products but not anymore.
1,defective game,"I am not happy with this game simply because is defective. This is the third time i have complained about this matter but i've been ignored cuz anybody have not replied me yet. The game is defective and i asked for my money back. This guy ""alphonse 221"" or whatever is not reliable. Not a good thing to sell other people defective merchandise. I really want this game for my collection and i ended up buying it again and more expensive. It is on its way right and hopefully this copy won't be defective. I feel frustrated firstable for not receiving my game in good conditions and, in second place, for being ignored. Don't do that people. I'm a good customer of yours cuz i'm always buying from you and is a pity if i decide not to buy from you anymore because you don't even care how am i feeling about this. I'm still waiting for an answer??????????"
2,Meidocre at best...,"Persona attempts to be an original, creative and interesting RPG game...but it doesn't quite succeed. Yes, the story line is original but the diagloge is LAME and the battle scenes are downright BORING. You spend alot of time wandering around town and during these scenes, your character party is reduced to a green blob. They're called graphics...why not use them? It's also really tedious to wander aimlessly through schools, hospitals, etc. checking each and every room for some form of action. The music gets real old fast and it takes awhile to get used to the controls of the game. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was for the original gameplay. Rent this game before you buy."
1,An RPG for kids,"I got this game for my birthday, I played it all night and I almost threw it away after about 12 hours of it. I know this was an attempt to make a game for kids and it almost did well but there were several flaws in it.The dialogue is lame. During scenes like when you're in a classroom, or in the nurses office or wherever you are the dialogue is lame. It doesn't catch the attention of the player and sometimes it goes completely off track. Another thing is the music, it is TERRIBLE! I couldn't stand the store music with that teenager singing! And the background noise in the hospital while the zombies are attacking sounds really weird and it's hard to tell what's going on. The charactors were also bad. but I don't think I should complain too much. My advise is to stay away from this and check out the Breath of Fire or Final Fantasy collection."
4,Claude Debussy: Piano Music (1888-1905),"I actually opted to buy this book as I had borrowed one owned by my piano teacher. As my sight reading is weak, what really appealed to me was that the notes and bars are very well spaced out and to me this makes the piece less intimidating to read. However I must point out that I find it a little disappointing that the quality of print is not consistent. A few pages, noticeably the first, suffer from slightly poor print quality. The treble clef in bar 5 is poorly printed and some of the quaver stems also suffer. The rest of the book is well printed.A small quibble other than which this is a really good book"
4,Beautiful but difficult music,"This book has a collection of Claude Debussy music for the advanced piano player. The music has many instances of two-against-three patterns with triplets in the right hand and eighth notes in the left hand. That said, this is a beautiful collection of music, with sweeping melodic lines, and beautiful harmonies that one can only expect from Claude Debussy. I give this four out of five stars for the difficulty of the music. One needs to be very proficient to be able to play these daunting left hand passages. Debussy originally trained to be a virtuoso piano player, and it shows in these works."
3,Good Approach to Software Documentation,"This is a good manual on software documentation and could be used as a beginning book for the job. However, I do believe that there are better books available on the subject. It is an excellnt starter book for individuals who are new to software documentation. Finally, the book is easy to read and follow."
2,Just a shadow of her former self...,"If you're looking for a sequel to ""Relish"" this isn't it. Joan's passionate portrayal of brazen romantic decadence and shameless sin that I so loved in the appropriately named ""Relish"" is completely absent in this new CD. It is as if Joan repented, sacrificed her inner spark, and become a rural country housewife. The only song that remotely echoes the good old days is the title cut albeit done gone countrified. I miss the old Joan. I want my money back. ""Relish"" still kicks the pants off all her other CDs."
2,A bit too country,"I am a big fan of Joan Osborne, but this CD is a bit too much country for my taste. It is only for die-hard Joan Osborne fans. I myself probably wouldn't have bought it if it would have been by another artist. It is beautifully played and sung, but the style just is'nt for me. I like her other stuff, but this one I probably won't play as much as her other CD's."
4,Pretty Little Stranger,"Powerful singing on personalized treatment of some classic songs. ""Who Divided?"", ""Broken Down Palace"", and ""Don't Tell ME How The Story Ends"" are favorites."
2,Tepid set from stellar artist,"I hate to give this a negative review because by many standards this is a decent recording. The songs are adequate, the arrangements are solid if uninspired, the song choice is at least thoughtful, and Joan can sing out of the phone book and still sound good. But...this is so far below what she's capable of and what she excels at that it is a serious disapointment to fans of the swampy back woods blues of ""Relish"", still one of my favorite CD's. There's nothing here to rival ""St. Teresa"", ""Ladder"", ""Spider Web"", ""Right Hand Man"", or even ""One of Us"" which I never need to hear ever again."
4,Very good first novel,I am looking forward to the next book.I read this book in one day. It was a page turner.
5,Love it!!!!!!!!,I loved this book. I was swept away to Argentina with Julia. Can't wait for number 2 & 3!!
2,Did not meet my dimensions,"I picked purchased one of these to hold flyers. According to the specs of the flyers should have fit but they did not at all. Very disappointed. In terms of quality, the product came in great condition with nice smooth leather. The smooth slippery type, not the gripping type."
2,Don't see the point,"I just don't see why I would use a book that recommends NOT doing some hikes. Why reading about why a hike is NOT good? For a reason NOT to go hiking on a day I feel lazy? I always supposed that hiking guidebooks in general contain hikes that are recommended by the author. The book has a lot of upsides, but a large portion of it seems useless to me."
2,"Okay, but there are better books","The writing is lively and informative, and the color pages give a good idea of the terrain covered by these hikes, but this book lacks maps and is very expensive - around $15 higher than a book called the Canadian Rockies Trail Guide, by Brian Patton, which is what all the locals recommend (as I found out after I'd already bought this book)."
1,Total piece of garbage,"This NIC card has horrible radio reception and only works for about 3 minutes after the initial connection is established. It says it's connected, but I only get 5KB/sec download speed on a 3Mbit/sec connection. I plugged in one of my usb stick wireless adapters and it works fine, so this interference claim my ASUS is garbage. Only buy this card if you are look for an interesting paper weight."
1,Are You Kidding?,Over $200 for a mail slot and cage? I don't care if it's brass or solid gold. That price is crazy.
5,Absolutely great. I play it all the time.,"I have been playing this CD regularly since buying it three years ago. Salamander Crossing is an amazing group, and this debut album combines great bluegrass harmonies with great instrumentals. Also includes some beautiful a capella singing in the bluegrass tradition. The songs are above love and life as you would be feeling it at 20, 25, 30, maybe later if you're young at heart... male and female band members, if you've ever felt the wind blowin down the canyon, if you've ever burnt a bridge or been burnt, this is an album for you. Listening to this album brings tears to my eyes almost every time."
1,Very dated,"This set of movies/TV shows was a perfect example of ""bad"" melodrama from the 1970s. The acting is, at best adequate, the plots ""so-so"", the musical accompaniment overdone, and the episodes were at best boring and overly drawn out."
2,Doesn't work properly,"One of the disks doesn't work properly. The others do, but I can't return the bad one. If I could get a replacement, I'd be happier."
3,Expensive,A high price for the item. but they work as you would expect. nothing special about them. Wouldn't buy them again. Just like the ones that come in the box.
3,How tame. What a shame.,"Go ahead and bite my head off, but this great jazz violinist sounds like he's accompanying movie sound tracks for Lawrence Welk on this album. If you like that kind of thing you'll like this album. If you think Jazz should be a least a little loose and raunchy and you want to add some Stephane Grapelli to your collection you'll want to try some other album."
1,I really wanted to like this.,"I really wanted to like this, but the language is archaic and rambling. I made it through the first 20 pages, but couldn't handle anymore. I am familiar with his amazing story, and I had hoped his prose would carry me through, but alas, no."
4,Just for fun,This CD was not suppose to be taken seriously. It was actually pretty good. Lilia can really sing. Austin's skits are comical and just make you laugh. Don't You Wish You Were Me soots Chris Jericho perfectly. Cena can rap pretty well. Crossing's borders was pretty good and I got a kick out of it. Angle's song was just awful. The Duley Boyz weren't to bad along with Los Guerreros. The worst track is Can You Dig it. Rikishi's song Put a little A$$ on it is pretty funny. All in all the CD is pretty good. Just skip Angle's and Booker T's tracks because they are the low point of this album.
3,Good.,"Good music, but Stone Cold is on there too many times two should be enough but John Cena Rocks!"
2,"WWE---Oh, it's original, alright!","Some of the songs on the CD are painful to listen to, even diehard WWE fans such as myself. Rikishi tries to sing, Kurt Angle tries to rap, and it's pretty pathetic. The best song is by far ""Basic Thugonomics."" That's the only reason I would buy the disc."
1,what the hell happened?,"wow all i can say is, what the hell happened?let me explain my review. i have been a huge wrestling fan for the better part of 25 years.i love to watch it, and i love to listen to the music.i have every single album\cd that has ever been made.this is by far the worst.the only two tracks with potential are lillian garcia's(great voice but the song truely sucks) and john cena's. to tell you the truth john cena's is the only one i can listen without thinking vince mcmahon has lost his mind.this cd isn't even worth downloading.next time, why don't you guys(cd producers) just make another entrance theme album.those always seem to be cool.this crap just makes me wretch."
4,An entertaining enterprise,"Ok I had some misgivings about this CD when I ordered it through Amazon.com. I had gotten this CD for my favourite athletes' theme songs and was surprised how well made this CD release was. I absolutely loved and enjoyed the Stone Cold skits, they were hilarious. Disc 1 is the songs and Disc 2 is a bonus CD full of the Making of the Originals.A must for any WWE fan."
4,Its Great,My name is John madigan and this is a great cd. this has good songs and a dvd that shows how they made the songs.its Great!John Madigan
1,WWE Original piece of Crap,"I love to watch wrestling especially when the story lines are good but I'm not going to defend this piece of trash just because Im a fan . Lilian Garcia is a wonderful singer and her song is the best on the cd but her song sounds like it belongs in an 80's Van Dam Movie (Jean Claude not Rob).StoneCold has 5 annoying talking tracks and not 1 where he actually sings, which he might as well have because he couldnt have been as bad as Booker T or Rikishi . Stacey keibler may have the absolute worst track on the album which is completly synthesized to cover her entire voice . Jericho and Cena were both tremendous disappointments especially Jericho who I thought because of his band experience would have a cooler song . Most every other track is just wrestlers yelling with a back beat. Watch American Idol and record all of the reject auditions because most of them are better than what you'll hear on this cd. I give it a D-, I would give it an F but it's just so darn entertaining."
3,Yes....They're singing,"WWE Originals is orginal alright with a few minor flaws.Dudley Boyz, Rey Mysterio, Chris Jericho, Lilian Garcia, and John Cena makes this cd worth checking out. All the Stone Cold Steve Austin skits along with Los Guerreros and Kurt Angle is your cure if you need a good laugh. One more thing, with Stacy Keibler's track, it sounds like shes having sex instead of dancing! The rest...judge yourself...."
1,Holy crap this is bad,"I am a huge wrestiling fan and this is by far the worst cd ever. All the women's except Lillian Garcia's song sucked. They sucked because all of the girls voices were so badly dubbed with the music, that you couldn't tell if they were singing. John Cena's was ok, as was Chris Jericho's. Thats it. The rest were so bad, that I don't even listen to them. The WWE is going downhill, and be smart and save your money. Don't buy this crap!"
2,WWE Originals,"I paid $20.00 for this album and it sucks. I am a big fan of WWE and the only 2 good songs are John Cena and Lita. I'm sorry, Trish better keep her day job. I'd never buy another WWE Cd if it was this quality. Kurt Angle song is the worst. Nastiest white rapper EVER!!!"
1,It sucks,"This CD SUCKS! The only good tracks out of the 17 are ""Don't you wish you were me"", ""Crossing borders"", ""Can you dig it?"", and ""we've had enough"" the rest are like nails on a chalkboard."
3,Ok,its ok just ok oh and the BLink 182 is the absolute worst thing i have ever heard. It was so bad im deaf in the left ear now.
4,Great CD,This is a great CD for people who like wrestling and music. Stone Cold is awesome. So is Lilian Garcia. She is the best singer on the CD.
1,"This is a joke, right? Right?",I feel real sorry for any deluded wwe fan that buys this embarassment.
1,Static City,Everytime i used the phone anywhere in the house all i got was static. i had to consistantly hit the channel button and still that did not solve the problem. for a 5.8ghz phone i think it is really poor. i have a uniden 900mhz which is so much better. i returned this product and continue to use my 900mhz phone. wouldnt recommend to anyone. that is at least anyone that wants to hear the other person clear...
2,Missing functionality,"Got this phone as a Christmas gift. The clarity is fantastic. However, you can not use both receivers at the same time. For instance, let's say ""Grandma"" calls and your kids want to use both phone extensions to talk to Grandma at the same time. It can't be done with this phone. The active extension blocks out the inactive one. You must physically transfer the caller to the other extension. We are using an ATT wireless system which is around 4 years old and it offers this capability.Also, this system does not appear to be expandable. So, you can't simply buy additional receivers to add to your system.Overall, I do not recommend this system."
1,Terrible,"I have two phone lines, and one has an expandable phone system by Panasonic (2.4 gHz). I wanted to have another line in just two rooms, so I thought this would be good. Plus, I thought that the 5.8 gHz offered by the Uniden phone would be really clear... THE 2.4 gHz HAS MORE CLARITY THAN THE 5.8 gHz!!! Plus, I heard clicking noise and static. The Panasonic 2.4 is crystal clear, while the Uniden 5.8 doesn't even register. The moral: Buy a __trustworthy__ brand."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this phone. I too had the VERY LOUD clicking noise, not only when I walked around, but when I was in the same room as the base. I also picked up my neighbors conversations, which never happened on my other cordless phone, an AT&T. I will be returning this phone to Target ASAP. Big waste of money."
2,Not the Best Uniden Phone,I purchased this phone and was very dissappointed. I have other Uniden phones for my business that are great but this phone is terrible. When I am talking the phone goes completely dead. The batteries life is null as this happens when I pick up the phone from the charger. The coverage is also average in comparision to my other uniden. I haven't even used the answering machine or the other features as I plan to return the phone.
2,At least it doesn't kick me off my wireless network,I hear static not more than 30 feet from the base. Ugh...
3,Pretty good basic phone,"We've had this phone for a few years now and it's been working just fine. Zero problems with signal or static or battery life. For your basic making and receiving calls, it's been flawless.There's a few changes I'd make to this phone:1) battery backup in the base unit so you don't have to re-set the time. I have way too many things to reset the time on after a power outage.2) Allow using both handsets simultaneously3) Add speakerphone4) allow it to work with additional headsets5) share speed-dial settings between phones so you don't have to program them twice"
2,Great Price but too much interference,"I really wanted to like this phone. Unfortantely the static was so bad that I had to return it. It really doesn't matter how great all the other features on the phone are if you can't hear when you are talking. I have a 2.4 Ghz Vtech phone that works great so I know the walls, wireless router, baby monitor and distance are not the problem."
3,WHAT'S THAT CLICKING NOISE,"I PURCHASED THIS PHONE A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. I NORMALLY USE THIS PHONE IN MY BEDROOM BUT I WALKED AROUND MY HOUSE YESTERDAY WITH IT AND IT MADE THIS CLICKING NOISE IN THE BACKGROUND.BUT ONCE I RETURNED TO MY BEDROOM TH CLICKING STOPPED. I LOOKED IN THE MANUAL TO SEE IF THERE WAS A QUICK FIX FOR IT AND IT WASN'T. I THOUGHT THE PURPOSE OF A CORDLESS PHONE WAS TO BE ABLE TO WALK AROUND WITH IT. THE PHONE THE UNIDEN REPLACED WAS AT&T PHONE (HAD IT ALMOST 5 YEARS) BUT THE CALLER ID WAS GOING OUT ON IT, AND I THOUGHT WITH ALL THESE FUNCTIONS IT WAS A GOOD PRICE (39.99). I THINK IF I DON'T FIGURE OUT WHAT HE CLICKING IS BY THE END OF THE WEEK I WILL BE RETURNING THIS BACK TO TARGET."
2,Not what I expected,"I have used other Uniden cordless phones and had very good results. This phone has a very small range for being 5.8GHz plus lots of static. The battery life on this phone is very short, not what I expected from Uniden."
2,"Color not accurate, thin","As mentioned by a previous reviewer, the material is fleece-ish on one side and a knit jersey on the other. It's thin and feels flimsy, not ""sweatshirt-like"" as I would expect from its title. I can see my hand through the fabric.Also important to note: the color ""winter white"" to this company apparently means ""ivory."" The robe is not a pure white as I ordered and expected but an eggshell/ivory color, so potential buyers, please take note of this. Sizing appears to be accurate."
2,I should have paid attention to the others,"I should have paid more attention and not ordered this item, color is not right, the material is not soft, I am not happy with this item and will NOT give this to my granddaughter for Christmas ,I will not send it back but I will trash it,"
2,Shame on you Kreator,"I understand that Kreator has changed its sounds somewhat over the 20yr period that they have been together, but this title just isn't that good. In fact, I wasnt even that thrilled with Extreme Agression when it was first released, yet it grew on me, it was just a bit slower then the previous lighting fast albums before it. Unfortantly, the vocal style just doesn't seem to go with Kreator's music on this effort. Since the Vocal is high pitched shrill, and the music just doesn't go in sync. I dont mind that its slow, but its to tuned down for his vocals (I forget the Vocalist name at the moment..UGHHH) This isn't a piss poor album, and I won't get it 1 star, since I save 0 and 1 star reviews for s**t like My Chemical Romance and Blink 182, yet this is pretty bad, with only a few bright spots, and shame on Kreator, a powerful leader in Extreme Music, for trying to experient with this"
2,Not Kreator--Coronator,"I just picked up this disc yesterday and I had to get in here to stop anyone who might think that they are buying a Kreator disc from buying this!! When I buy Kreator disc, I expect to hear Kreator, not Coronor. Granted, Coronor used to be awesome, but they play two different styles of metal. Coronor kicked out the grinding hard melodic metal, whereas Kreator has always been known for the ""Extreme Agression"". Play it the way it should be played, or don't play it at all!! Bring Back the ""Lost"" sound of metal and stop trying to change. Fans listen to Kreator for a reason, because they like that sound, and if you like the Kreator sound, pop ""Cause For Conflict"" into your CD player and turn it up! Whatever you do, don't pick up ""Outcast"" unless you really didn't like the Kreator sound to begin with!! LONG LIVE METAL--LONG LIVE THE LOUD!!"
5,Not an album for thick headed fans,"Sure I loved Cause For Conflict. It is one of Kreator's all time greatest. But you can't expect a band to play the same damn thing forever. You have to be open minded to listen to Outcast. You won't be disappointed. Kreator stresses melody and not technicallity. Well I also believe that another band is doing this as well. They go by the name of.....Dream Theater. If you consently just play to sound intellegent, you'll lose the soul. And Kreator shows a perfect example of keeping soul in their music with Outcast. Kreator plays not nearly as fast as Cause For Conflict. Bu.t still keep the gain up on their amps. You have to give Outcast a try and not listen to the bad reviews. You won't be disappointed"
2,I'll pass on this one,"I've been a Kreator fan since 'Pleasure to Kill' and I like all forms of metal (fast and slow), but I just can't stomach this from Kreator. It is mid-paced, boring and forgettable. The only song I can stand to listen to is 'Phobia'. When Mille tries to sing it is just plain awful. Avoid this release and 'Endorama' and buy EVERYTHING else - that's my advice to you."
4,stronger than before,"This is the first time I listened to the whole album, and must say I am satisfied from the music magic by Kreator. True hard, heavy metal sound (phobia, nonconformist, enemy unseen) except the ballads Outcast and Black Sunrise which somewhat ruin the impression. The sound effects are awesome too.One of the best albums around...."
3,I like this.,"For some reason this is their only experimental album that I actually thought was pretty good. Don't get me wrong, I'll always prefer their 80's and very early 90's heavier Thrash, border-line Death Metal sound over this, but this isn't as bad as others are saying it is. Tracks 1-4 alone are worthy of a 3-star rating.Give it a chance. It may grow on you."
4,"It's not the opening, it's ENOZ.","This CD is not what I was under the impression I was getting, but it's still great. It's the two songs Aya Hirano sings for the show's Arts Fest episode, and Mikuru's song from episode 0."
4,MARRIKAS Lightweight White Goose Down Comforter,"I was impressed with the high quality of this product but it is warmer than I expected. However, overall, I am please with this purchase."
5,Short but wonderful,"Can a male saviour save women? This question has been hounding me for a long time. I've read big fat books by Ruether, Elizabeth A. Johnson, Schussler-Fiorenza, but this little gem of a book gave me an answer. It's written in very understandable English, and addresses very tough questions without lapsing into anger (not that anger is wrong, but it gets in the way). Schneiders answers the question ""can a male saviour save women?"" the answer is YES. Not only that, she shows that in order to do it, G-d >had< to be incarnated in a male, so as to bust patriarchy from the inside. Made a lot of sense to me. I will read all other books by this author."
2,Arguments Presented Weak,"""Women and the Word"" is a very short work. I read it in one sitting, and while parts of it had value, they were few and far between. Whenever Schneiders presents anything controversial, such as that it is equally valid to refer to God as she instead of he, her arguments fail. She doesn't respond to the common reasons given against her position but takes the time to refute strawman arguments.This book is something that can be skipped."
1,Half The Songs Are Mastered Horribly,"This is a review of the sound quality only.Half the songs on this disk are mastered so hot they clip and distort. Also the amount of dynamic range compression on that half of the disk is unacceptable. This is primarily a Jazz release, and therefore sound quality should be an important imperative int the production of the disk. They obviously did not care about giving their customers/fans the best product they could. Instead they went down the road of trying to increase the average volume level as much as they could so as to assault the ears of their listeners. 1/2 of the record sounds like a crushed rock release.In terms of sound quality, this record is a cynical sonic mess. Avoid.look up 'loudness war' at wikipedia or google 'pleasurize music' or 'turnmeup' for more info."
4,Demoniac!,"Second out for Groundtruther project. Guest DJ Logic's messing around with turntablism allows Previte & Hunter to ride free in continuous sound hints and sparkling solos. Previte is powerfull and heavy-beating on acoustic drum; Hunter turns distorsion on and plays lots of dramatically-bare riffs for high moments of interplay.Less 'jazz-like' than Latitude, maybe difficult to listen to for predictability-bound ears, but fresh and stimulating if you approach music by the what's-going-to-happen side."
1,Useless,The adhesive was useless and went in the trash...perhaps in hot weather it could work ok but that would be the only scenario. I tried using on a clean surface in 50-60 degree weather and wouldn't stick at all.
2,Poor adhesive on second roll.,"I was able to install the first roll of 1033 weather striping with good results, however, the second roll ordered a week or so later was lacking in adhesive and keeps failing and coming loose when opening the hatch."
5,"Works great, saves the environment",I normally use Seventh Generation dish soap but I have found this to be a more affordable and just as effective solution.
2,Ecover Contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate,"I purchased this product through Amazon a few months ago trusting the description of the ingredients list, but if you go to [...] you will see this product contains SLS, fragrance and other questionable ingredients. I liked this dish liquid because it was gentle on my skin and safe to wash baby bottles... so I thought. I've learned (but not with all products, fortunately) it's best to go to the actual website for a ""complete"" ingredients list."
2,Not worth it,"I LOVE that this product is ecofriendly, but it's so thin that it feels like squirting water onto my dishes...and with a BIG squirt of the dishwashing liquid, it only bubbles for a few inches. Meaning, I squirt almost a tablespoon onto ONE plate and after three seconds, it feels like I'm just swirling the wash rag on the plate with nothing sudsing and cleaning. I MUCH prefer Seventh Generation, which I bought at the same time as Ecover. It's thicker, bubbles like traditional soap, and makes me feel like my dishes are actually clean."
2,Not so great,"Have to use 1/4 of a bottle for one sink full of dishes. Will go back to 7th gen. I love Ecover products, just not this one."
4,Ecover Dishwashing Liquid Review,"Overall, I have been very satisfied with this dishwashing liquid. It cleans well, is very gentle, and smells great. It has a pleasant lemon scent that does not overwhelm you. According to Ecover, the product is made out of natural substances versus chemicals so you might be doing the environment a favor.However, the reason I give it 4/5 stars is that more dishwashing liquid is required per use. Because it rinses so well, the liquid comes off the sponge and more needs to be applied. At the price Amazon is selling it, this is not a problem. It makes for a great hand soap as well unlike conventional dishwashing soaps."
3,"OK, but gets used up too fast!!","I tried this after being disappointed by 7th generation dish soap and the ecover is a step up in my opinion. however, it doesn't suds very much and doesn't seem to clean that well with just a little. Forget about it when my husband is doing dishes -- he goes through a ton of this. It's hard to find locally and the s/h is expensive if I buy online. I ended up trying Trader Joe's and liking that. Palmolive and Clorox also now have ""eco"" dish soap that is free of petroleum based products and the Clorox one is okay. Haven't tried Palmolive. they are available at grocery stores and big chain stores.We use ecover laundry soap, fabric softener, dishwasher powder tablets, as well as floor soap, 7th generation all purpose cleanser spray, method hand soap, so it's not that I am anti-ecover or not used to environmentally friendly products."
1,Film of a yoga conference,I wanted a DVD that would be a yoga workout video. This is the filming of the yoga conference and is long and boring. You listen to Iyengar teach the students harshly and then watch the mobs at the conference file into positions. It was not helpful for my intentions.
2,iyengar,"If you are a yogi, I would not recommend this book. Has information you already know. Waste of money!"
5,I Am Happy With My Purchase,"This item arrived before the scheduled delivery date, and it was in pretty good condition when it arrived. The packaging was great and I was very happy with my purchase."
1,Purchase an extended warranty with this TV,"I purchased this TV on August 1, 2007. A year later, the TV would not always power on. The instructions advise resetting the TV by holding the on/off button down for five seconds. This generally took care of the problem. Last week, the TV would not power on at all and would not reset. Repairs to the TV are $484, over 75% of the cost of the TV. Like others who have written about this TV, the TV has a faulty power board, apparently a problem with this TV. If you purchase this TV, you should also purchase an extended warranty."
4,Regaza 26,"I had to return the first one as it did not want to turn on, so I thought I would try another as I really liked the looks of this unit. It is being used in my kitchen-dining area & I have it hooked up to a Dish Network high definition receiver. The picture & sound are very good. I had a previous Toshiba console 35"" crt for about 10 years & never had 0ne problem with it so I felt confident in Toshiba. Also have to give Amazon customer service an A+ as they handled the replacement very well. Also remember if you hook this tv up to a high definition source to use an hdmi cable as this will give you the best sound & picture."
3,Great picture quality - but it stopped working after 1 month,"I bought this TV a month ago. I had a 42"" Samsung TV but it was too large to take to my new place when I moved so I left it with my family. The picture on the Toshiba LCD is superior to the larger plasma. However, the TV just stopped working one evening, no power going to it. The authorized Toshiba service centers in the Washington, DC area will not pick it up because the size is too small for them to do an in-home repair (like the warranty says they should). This has been a pain so far.Update - the TV is now repaired and works great. The service center could have been better as I just had the TV shipped back to Toshiba for a replacement."
1,Disappointed in Delaware,"Amazon did a great job. The product arrived quickly. We set it up quickly and got it to work. On the second night, the product ""died."" In working with Amazon, we were able to return it for credit (except we didn't get shipping cost refunded, even tho we put the shippin receipt in the box). We haven't rec'd the credit yet, but have rec'd confirmation that the product arrived at the receiving point.)While it was working the 26"" Toshiba set worked fine. We were satisfied with it.Jerry Martin"
5,David Hawkins a beautiful soul,"When I first read this book, i was almost completely frustrated because i did not understand a single thing he was talking about with consciounes or what the term enlightenment even referred to. I now after exposing myself to this book just by skipping around to various chapters have found myself completely intrigued. My life has completely taken a new spin after reading this book. Highly reccomend. Changed my life for the forever in my search for truth and understanding. I can't wait to read his other books."
5,how to help save the planet... read this book...,"This is probably one of the most powerful modern-day books in print. Everyone should read this. It explains how we can all tell who's lying and who's telling the truth very simply, in a matter of seconds. This would put an end to lawyers, judges, police, etc. Most of us have no clue how powerful we are. One very important point he makes is about kids and their addictions to rap and hard rock music. These types of music contain subliminal messages, can cause future health problems, and may actually be the reason behind a ssenseless crime committed by your child later on. Sound familiar? You know, that nice, quiet kid? All your food and water can be tested, too, to see whether you should eat that Big Mac, which I'm sure would score near the bottom of the scale... Please read this book and pass it around!"
5,Consciousness confirmed with muscle testing,"The discipline known as behavioral kinesiology/muscle testing deals with the theory that muscles react differently to positive and negative stimuli. Muscle testing is the bridge between two worlds- the physical one and the world of spirit, the part of all of us that is in touch with ""the vast intelligence of the universe."" The future is subject to change and under most circumstances cannot be tested. Everything else can be tested for truth."
1,Bunk,"I started reading this book which echoe'd a lot of other books in this genre, but partway through the book something seemed off. I went online and started to look more into David Hawkins and Kinesiology, which is used as a basis for all of his claims.Pretty soon the entire world of woo and pseudoscience that this book is based on came crumbling down and I realized just how misguided books like this are.It's ignorance and prejudice masking itself as enlightenment, with Hawkins as the self-appointed arbiter of good vs. evil (but cleverly hidden behind the practice of kinesiology).The only redeeming thing about this book is that it precipitated the undoing of a lot of unfalsifiable and erroneous beliefs that I had accumulated over the years that has been based on bunk like the kind Hawkins peddles to the unwary."
3,Psychology rules determining behavior,"I thought of this book in terms of physics. Power has more influence over physical world then force does, simply due to it definition. It affects greater area of space than force does. I tried to understand how this notion trancends in the world of psychology. I was pleased to learn that analogy is very simlar as well as overall meaning of it. Althought I was never able to fully understand grading points for various human behavior as defined in the book, on intuitive level, it was easy to understand noble human behaviour including spirituality and enlightnment to the ones on the oposite side of the spectrum. This book is easy to read and has some very interesting observations."
5,Outstanding read on human behavior,"I couldnt say enough about this book when it comes to understanding human behavior. It is tough to read at times, a little scientific but the last half of the book where the author talks about the results of the science behind the work and I find it fascinating. He talks about power and sports, consciousness, spirituality and much more in a way I havent understood quite like this. Great book"
5,A book to help you become more enlightened...,"I actually went to my local library after reading Dr. Wayne Dyers book ""Power of Intention"" in that book he mentions this one a few times. Anyway, I re-newed Power v Force 3 times, and then decided I want to own it. So I bought it, it's that good...It's a little tough to take in all the information in one reading, plus you will be drawn to re-read it as it explains so much (sometimes a little technical too) and will open your eyes to why it's critical to think positive instead of negative. The documented facts it reveals are amazing.There is so much in this book, no wonder Dr. Wayne Dyer says it's one of the best books he's read in the last ten years. I totally agree.Bottom line, great book for people searching to become more enlightened and more spiritual. Solid information. Eye opening too."
3,Borrow from the Library,"Like most of the other reviews, my opinion is mixed. Besides some of the obvious contradictions others have mentioned, there was one that really jumped out at me in the early part of the book: If people's energy really affects other people's, shouldn't you take one of the people (the tester) out of the equation and standardize things so there's no experiementer bias? Scientific method requires eliminating the bias of the researcher.I did enjoy the book, although I'd read enough about muscle testing elsewhere and been the subject of it.I did, indeed, borrow the book from the library and am glad I saved my money. I appreciate Dawkins' research, but his preachiness was tiresome and bordered on the dogmatic. His absolute assurance that this was THE method and that he could PROVE it, violated that most basic of scientific method tenets--you don't prove anything; you show correlation."
5,Power VS. Force,The book is fantastic. Everyone should have it for reference in their library for life.
5,Comes with GREAT understanding and Growth!,Comes with GREAT understanding and Growth! I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand anything ! Great book
2,Hawkins is VERY dualistic,"I am writing a review on ""Power vs Force"". I have also read ""The Eye of the I"" and ""I Reality and Subjectivity"". I wanted to give Hawkins a fair chance so I also ordered some of his seminar tapes. He goes on and on about ""nonduality"" yet his teachings are very much about ""spiritual work"", ""do this work and you will eventually become enlightened. It is about ""getting somewhere in the future"". If you read his books and listen to his tapes you will find them bogged down with Christianity. He cannot get away from ""good vs evil""."
4,A Powerful Book!,"As a spiritual author myself, I often write about the true power that comes from higher states of beingness -- such as love and compassion -- and how the accomplishments that come via the ego are really just matters of force. When we FORCE things to go the way we want them to go, it requires a lot of energy, a lot of effort, and a lot of attention. That is not my idea of ""power."" When you have true power you manifest effortlessly!I applaud Dr. Hawkins for demonstrating in a scientific fashion the difference between power and force. Thank you, Dr. Hawkins!Steven Lane Taylor, author of Row, Row, Row Your Boat: A Guide for Living Life in the Divine Flow"
1,Poppycock,"There is nothing in this book that is worth reading. The author must be certifiably crazy. I have an open mind about a lot of things, and am seldom skeptical because I believe life is more mysterious than we think. But this is too much even for me."
2,"The ""science"" in this book makes me go weak","I had very different reactions to the two main components of this book. Hawkins' musings about new age philosophy I often found compelling and even convincing. But his attempts to quantify truth through kinesiological science are presented in such an unscientific manner that it drags much of the book down. Even if you wanted to believe in the method he describes, Hawkins doesn't bother to address any of the obvious challenges that would come to the mind of any thoughtful reader. Instead, we are supposed to believe that his method works every time, perfectly. I would have enjoyed the book a lot more if Hawkins had presented this research as a sidebar of intriguing new experiments instead of trying to claim that there is a foolproof method for answering every great philosophical question and using it as a framework for his entire discussion. I give the book 4 stars for philosophical intrigue, but -2 stars for it's ""science."""
5,The single most important book I own,"The title of this review says it all. I will read, re-read and read again and again this title. The title of the book does not do it justice in terms of the profound nature of its contents. If you read only one book a year, this is your book for this year."
3,Unexpectedly insightful,"I don't know anything about Kinesiology or the validity of the claims in this book. Never tried it. However, some of the passages were highly insightful as to simple steps toward awakening and experiencing the deeper ""spiritual"" levels of awareness that have been very enriching to my experience. Just as one can develop a deeper appreciation for fine food or wine, or a greater sense of exquisite music or art, the way one actively percieves the world can be enriched and refined, sometimes to an immeasurable degree that takes one far far from the ordinary. Dr. Hawkins books are of value to those seeking enlightenment."
2,Satisfy your curiousity by checking it out at your local library,"I rushed out to buy this book based on an endorsement by Wayne Dyer. What a disappointment! Dr. Hawkins promises to keep things simple but they were anything but. I had so much difficulty following the author's train of thought that I quit before reaching the end of the book. It was boring with a capital ""B"". In addition, Hawkins consistently uses research from 20 or 30 years ago to back his theories making his book seem instantly outdated. In short, it's not the caliber ""enlightenment/self help"" book I had hoped for. As much as I admire Wayne Dyer's beliefs and his writing style, his promo of this book must be kept in context. Dyer's newest book, Power of Intention, was published by Hay House, the same publisher of Power vs. Force."
2,"Not to nit-pick, but . . .","My MD uses muscle testing to prescribe. I do qigong. I'm a groovy guy. I love Abraham-Hicks and Ernest Holmes. However . . ., twice Dr Hawkins states that every sentence in the book was tested by his techniques for veracity. The problem that kept eating away at my suspension of disbelief was the statement that trees are not as robust at higher altitudes due to a lack of oxygen. This is untrue. Our plant brothers and sisters use carbon dioxide in their metabolism and not oxygen. The effect of altitude his comparable to a change of latitude. There is not less oxygen at 5000' Alaska than at 15000' Kenya, yet they have the same alpine climate and tree growth.It just bugged me. Every sentence was checked by these methods then the method has some failings on a very simple, checkable fact.I am predisposed to agree with the content of the book but you could spend your time more prophetably playing Wild Divine."
1,"Beware any author who praises the ""humane"" WalMart.","This book was recommended to me by my employer. Imagine my surprise when I read in the chapter dealing with business practices about how you can tell that Walmart is such a good and humane company by how motivated and helpful the employees are. Whoops. Guess this chapter which ""calibrated"" highly in the author's ""truth"", must have been written before the other ""truths"" about Walmart started to become known: namely that Walmart employees tend to live in poverty and are eligble for public assistance in many communities. Better than thisquacks hockus pockus attempt to quantify and sanitize something as relative as ""truth"", I'd recommend ""Nickled and Dimed"" by Barbara Ehrenreich. A more truthful look at the subject matter."
4,Masterpiece littered with unnecessary verbal acrobatics,A truely fascinating book ! Dr. Hawkin's work has shaped my destiny and perception to put it mildly.My only criticism is Dr. Hawkin's unnecessary use of twisted words and jargons. Books of this nature must be written with a simple format where words only serve as a vehicle to get the message across. minus 1 star for that reason! The wisdom does deserve 5 stars though...
4,Nice Try,"Reads best starting from the last chapter and progressing backwards. This exhibits the spiritual qualities of the work much more clearly. The kinesiology claims are quite suspect. The work is, as presented, scientifically worthless and spiritually valuable. One would like to reframe the whole technology more along the lines of a systematic and rigorous study, even if that resulted in less powerful claims, then proceed with the exposition of the values scale as a well documented spiritual intuition. As it is, the book remains wishful thinking from a scientific standpoint, while it offers an inspiration for the holy way for the more heuristically inclined."
2,Skeptical,"Search the World Wide Net and see if you can locate one good study that has been done on the efficacy applied kinesiology. The problem with this method, although it looks very impressive, is that the consciousness and effect of the administrator is not taken into consideration. Therefore, people will get different results from various practitioners, which I have witnessed. By the way, the body (including muscles) does sometimes lie, although it does remember nearly all events in our past, but muscles testing is not the best way to access them. However, muscle testing can be an effective tool in the hands of someone who is intuitive. Be very careful of erasure techniques (tapping, literally, into the subconscious) as they basically treat symptoms and do little to truly empower an individual."
5,Power vs. Force,"Believe this is life-changing information. Knowledge that I wish everyone had.I will be buying all of Dr. David Hawkins books, CD's and any other information of his that is available. He is a rare gift to the world & I'm grateful to learn from him.Thank You,Elaine Morgan"
1,He is over the edge,"There is some truth in the book. Enough truth to make you want to believe it. However it is full of nonsense and when you Google Hawkins you find out he has somewhat of a cult following. He has been drinking too much of his own Kool Aid.I have heard it said that man worships his maker. This is true for ""self made men"" like Hawkins too.This book can be misleading to people and I think it is unfortunate that he ruined the good in his book by going too far into believing his own, unproven theories. I do not recommend this book."
2,another bible to rule and judje...,"it seems to me another bible or rule to judje. even the so called devil is god, god is everything, even if we judje it to be the bad, bad or good only is in the eye of the beholder, what we see we get what we beleive we create. it is time we get our own opinion,ideas, we are gods..do not forget it. read something about Lester Levenson or Ramtha. we get to see with our own eye..."
4,Good but not completely convincing,"I really like the ideas presented in this book. With various types of research, Hawkin's discusses the mysterious side of our psyche in a ""scientific"" manner. The conclusions he makes are very interesting but not completely convincing. For a better and more convincing explanation of our how our mind works, I'd suggest, ""The Ever-Transcending Spirit"" by Toru Sato. The ideas are not the same although there is some overlap. But Sato has a knack for explaining these things in a way that makes a lot of sense to a wider variety of people. This book is definitely worth a read though!"
2,An Unwaranted Conclusion,"Since I have been using kinesiology in a way very similar to the techniques advocated by this author and have found it to be a valuable tool, I was interested enough in the subject to read the results of his testing. I will only say that I was totally ""non-plussed"" by the naivete of the author's conclusions and by the subjective nature of the responses that the author wishes to call ""truth""."
1,Didn't finish.,I have better things to do with my time. Ya lost me. Seems like a lot of metaphysical mumbo jumbo. Snake oil.
5,THE NEW BIBLE,"I know it sounds crazy at first, but only a fool would read this book and pretend that the information inside is not the bottom line for a new era of enlightenment. I have bought ten copies to spread them around and in my city alone i can already see and feel a change in the way people act towards each other and themselves. I was deep into drugs, consumerism, and was spiritually hollow before i read this book. In the course of two months i have become a teacher and a student...You will not be let down if you approach this book with an open mind and then use the techniques inside. This review is the only one you'll need to read. I PROMISE WHOLEHEARTEDLY!"
3,Not overly inspiring,"Tends to be tedious and difficult. Lots of references, not inspiring and I had to force myself to finish. Mundane, interesting, but not inspiring. I expected much more especially with Dyer's glowing endorsement."
3,Interpreting the Database,"There's been a lot of discussion about Dr Hawkins' book. Whether you buy into ""attractor fields"", the science of kinesiology or such I have to state that I did enjoy this book. I won't endeavor to substantiate his findings but I did learn from his perspective on the relationship of awareness, consciousness, experience and the mechanics of perception.The book can lean to a bit of clinical talk now and then but it's kept to a reasonable level. I didn't get distracted by the testing and the rating scale of energy levels as I really was more interested in Dr Hawkins' explanation as to what is behind the curtain in respect to human behaviors.Dr Hawkins illustrates how the implementation of power supports and nourishes while the use of force consumes. That topic will make you consider how humans approach the stewardship of government and planet."
5,I liked this book,This is a very interesting perspective on the world and reality. I highly recommend it. It goes along with a companion volume called The Eye of the I.
5,Powerful - but not for everyone!,"This clearly is the most powerful spiritual book I have ever read; however, this book is not for everyone. If you have not developed a spiritual discipline - at best, this book will simply be confusing or foolish. If you are ready, this book is a mindwalk."
1,"Laughably poor science, and offensive too.","As other reviewers have commented, the use of mathematics in this book is unbearably bad. And the ""science"" is, at best, pseudo-science. He uses his own methods to assess those same methods. His results don't hold up to double-blinded experiments, and require the researcher to be specifically seeking out the outcomes that will support the theory. In general, you should be suspicious of any theory which specifically states within it that only evidence in support of it should be considered, and that contradictory results should be ignored.And perhaps worst of all is the deeply offensive way in which these results are then applied. He uses his methods to rate the relative enlightenment levels of different religions, so that he can ""prove"" that Islam is a lower level of humanity than Christianity.Bad science is bad enough, and shouldn't be encouraged. But bad science being used as an attempt to intellectually justify bigotry is just disgusting."
1,Absolute Nonsense,"A quick search on PubMed will reveal that ""Applied Kinesiology"" has failed every attempt at scientific rigor. No double-blind study has ever supported his conclusions and even the most cautious reviewers opine that there is no scientific basis to believe any of this man's claims.More digging only yields more questions - Hawkins received his PhD from the never-accredited, now discredited, Columbia Pacific University - an institution characterized by the California Attorney General as ""a diploma mill"".In short, there are serious doubts as to the majority of the factual claims presented in this book. The metaphysical mumbo-jumbo is past my pay grade (I'm just a scientist, after all) and is untestable at any rate (although I have my doubts on that too)."
2,There are better options...,"After having tried the Thirsties covers, Proraps and the Bummi Whisper Wraps, the Thirsties win hands down. I've found that the Bummis tend to leak more because there are no gussets around the legs and the layer of cloth that is on the inside actually seems to wick the moisture outside so I end up not only changing the diaper but also my baby's clothes (and sometimes sheets!) whenever I use them. While this may be ok during the day, it is definitely not fun at night! The cloth on the inside also stains easily with poopy diapers so reusing the covers are just not an option as they are with the Thirsties (you can just wipe down the inside and they're ready to go) which means more washing. After only about 2 months of use, the Bummis also seem more worn and old-looking. Overall, I would say--spend your money on another cover. For the same cost, who needs a cover that makes it harder, not easier, to cloth diaper?"
4,Great product,These are one of two brands that my daughter does not soak through in the night. They wash up nicely and seem as good as the day I bought them. My only wish is that they had fold back laundry tabs for the velcro. They stick to other things in the wash. I think this puts extra wear on the velcro too.
5,Great Size for Newborns,"We have a cloth diaper service but the covers they sold us are just too big for our 7 pound newborn. We bought two of these covers to tide us over until she fits into the other covers. These Bummis have a small pocket in the front of the diaper for inserting your cloth diaper and this makes placement of the cloth easier. They are quite silky--all polyester--and wash very well. No style seems to contain all the baby poo or keep it on the diaper and not on the cover at all, but these fit well so are doing ok. The velcro tabs allow you to vary the size of the leg hole. This newborn size does fit our baby and I recommend it if your child is tiny or ""normal"", or just to start with."
3,Gaps at legs,"This diaper cover is very well made. But the leg holes are huge! And since there is no leg gusset, it has no hope of containing my baby's messes. My daughter is 95th percentile for height, so she is a long skinny baby. I believe it would work much better for a chunky thighed baby. Proraps are what ended up working for us."
1,I hate these!!!!!!!,"I really don't understand why these are even being sold as waterproof. They literally leak through to my son's clothes 9 out of 10 times. They are not waterproof AT ALL, not in the least! I am THOROUGHLY disappointed with them! I'm ditching them and buying all-in-one (AIO) covers from a Chinese manufacturer on eBay. I have one of their wraps, which are made for an insert, though I just use it as a cover because it wicks away the moisture much better. I would NEVER recommend these to anyone!"
5,diaper cover,"This is an excellent product. I have never used a cover before, as I always used disposable diapers, but this is great."
4,Princeton-MIT,"The book was reasonably well written and comprehensive, but had two flaws. The footnoting could have been more presented with actual numbers referenced to corresponding entries in the footnote section as opposed to just having the page numbers. Also, the author kept using the first names of people Sarton knew. A more rigorous approach and one that would have helped keep better track of her associates would have been to occasionally use the last names as well."
2,Confirmation of Ms. Sarton's total self-involvement.,"This book confirmed to me what was always apparent for the fan willing to read between the lines of Ms. Sarton's ""journals"". She was a totally self- involved woman, as well as an intellectual and name dropping snob. My instincts were correct; both she and her journals were a fraud!On the other hand, I found most of her novels delightful and her poetry touching. It's okay with me she had feet of clay. At one time or another, don't we all? The disappointment: hers were constant.By way of explanation--the 3 rating was for Ms. Peters' disjointed writing, and at times, introduction of a character without giving the reader a clue to who she was. Particularly, Judy.She just dropped in by way of a new paragraph. Might be others too, but I rather gave up trying to adapt to the author's style of prose."
4,Who was the real May?,"I enjoyed reading this book. Of course it was very negetive, but I think May had a very low self-esteem that began in childhood. I enjoy her books, poetry& journals. I feel the real May was inside herself and reading between the lines of this book made me see that. She really felt bad about all the people she hurt but she couldn't change. I hope in the end she made peace with herself and realised her talent."
5,"Peters' biography reveals truth behind ""Myth of May""","For fans who have been drawn to the healing balm of May Sarton's novels, poetry and journals, this biography may be hard to take. Many readers of Sarton, myself included, had fallen deeply for the world May had constructed for the reader. One feels turmoil bubbling under the surface of workds like ""Journal of a Solitute"" but it never surfaces. Through her writing, Sarton had created her own ""private mythology"" while ""keeping the hell out of her work"" (to quote her friend and critic, Louise Bogan). Margot Peters captures the hell for her in this meticulously researched biography. It is a compelling read that, if closely analyzed, does not betray May Sarton and her works;it illuminates the woman, making her life story what Sarton's writing should have been - raw and intense."
2,Profoundly dissappointing,"Sarton's works speak for themselves. If the art that she produced touches and transforms people's lives, why should we or do we revel in the sundry details of her life that were ill-spent? While I agree that a biography had to be done, perhaps this one enjoys destroying her subject a bit too much. Further, perhaps the art that she created, which is a contrast to her tumultuous life, is ultimately what will survive. I'd like to see more recognition of that in the biography, and less attention to the morbid details."
5,A gem of a comedy album,"Maria Bamford is the real deal. This is genuine, hilarious and quality stand-up material. Her unusual style and array of voices are simply superlative. For fans of outstanding stand-up comedy."
4,Buy This Now,"If you have not yet heard Maria Bramford, you should buy this now. If you have heard her, then you know why you should buy it. Are you tired of comics who only do jokes about things that happen in the bathroom or the bedroom? Bramford expands the universe of what we can laugh about."
5,What saved our lives The CCC,My dad was panning for gold to try to feed us. With out the CCC I don't know what would have happened. Dad went.into the USFS right after the CCC. He spent the rest of his happy life there. I'm so thankful for FDR. I was horrified to find that my Grandson hear nothing about the CCC in High School. That is why I ordered this Program.
2,corbel,"Order 2 of this corbel, both of their edges were cut in different places. Although it is only a tiny piece got cut, still don't look good."
4,"An important band, in pretty fine form","The much-vaunted Colonels, playing live at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival. Plenty of great old tunes and much earnest re-creation of the classic ""high lonesome"" sound. To be honest, I've often found their reputation outweighs their recorded legacy... Although I understand the band's importance to their generation of pre-hippie pickers, I can never help but notice the rough spots in their picking (particularly in Clarence White's guitar work) and, at times, the callowness in their vocals. Still, they were a lively and enthusiastic band, and this disc captures them at their best. Roland White's mandolin work is mighty purty, especially when he gets in a groove with Bill Keith's amazing banjo pickin'. Plus, Doc Watson shows up to play along and encourage the lads, midway through their show, and that's always a treat. Definitely worth checking out."
5,Great DVD set!,Perry Mason: Seasons 1-4 is a very good DVD set. Arrived on time and in perfect condition. A lot better than what's currently on network TV! Well worth the money.
1,Cheaper for those who put off buying,"Once again, we are shown that it pays to wait. Anyone who likes PM and hasn't bought it yet should snatch this up. For you, it's a bargain - four seasons with an average price of under $50 a season. The rest of season four hasn't been released yet. Those of us who bought the first three seasons as they were released are being charged a higher price. Season one alone (39 shows) was (and is still being sold for) about $80. I have to pay $65 for season four but the person who buys this set gets it for less than $50. There is something rotten in the state of Paramount. Its pricing schemes stink to high heaven."
2,A two star CD and nothing more.,"TI thought Reel Big Fish, it must be good. I read the customer review and most said it was good. Was I in for a surprise. The RBF song is good, as is the Save Ferris song and there are a few othere ok songs but unless you are a die die hard skank fan not a good buy"
2,substituted on product for another,"I purchased 4 of these as pictured, the ones I received were the type that were made for the cans that are self venting, their are two spouts in the nozzle one for gas one for air venting. when a picture of a product is shown that is what you should get. I did not want to go through the hassle of a return so I am EATING THEM.. the company makes a quality product but I wont trust Moeller marine.. If this means anything Moeller marine should send me what was ordered from AMAZON.. that is pictured.. Thank you for asking. Dave Rose"
2,Moeller Scepter Gas Can Spout,I probably did not pay enough attention when I ordered this. It will not work for my application. I need a spout that is much more flexible. I am trying to use it to put gas in a boat. The tank fills from the top and the spout is not flexible enough to get it bent over into the tank without tilting the can so much I spill gas.I guess the workmanship and quality are OK if they would work for my application. I would return the 3 spouts I have not opened but it would cost almost as much as I paid for them. I will chalk them up to experience.
4,Moeller Scepter Gas/Diesel /Water Can Replacement Parts,The moeller scepter gas/ diesel spout and caps are a good product. The main cap fits on the more modern gas cans. The main cap don't fit on the older type gas cans.
2,Too slow and too much trouble,"Just as my title says, I did not like this item and I would not recommend anyone purchasing it. Its flow is too slow, the whole thing is to rigid and that makes it difficult to bend to fit your tank. The cap it comes with does not fit my Filtz gas container; I had to use the one that I already had originally. There is no cap to keep the fumes from escaping while storing the gas.I made the mistake of buying two of those things. I only opened one and immediately was extremely disappointed and frustrated as I realized I wasted my money and time. Now I have to go to the nearest autopart store to look for one that will actually work!"
5,Same as original parts,Just like the original parts. Would have preferred metal but you can't find those anymore. Everything is plastic. If you over tighten the cap will split so only hand tight and it's fine.
5,If you need tools...,"Dr. Bradley Gale is one of the world's leading authorities on the process of Value Mapping. Value Mapping is the technique of turning customer feedback from customers into powerful management tools that point the way to improve profits. Value Mapping is an excellent approach for industrial marketers to include in their arsenal of analytical tools. This book is filled with examples and framework templates that show you how to do it. The key for those of us in industrial marketing is getting the customer data. It's usually more difficult in industry, and there is often low or no funding available for market research. Once your company decides to stop ""flying blind"" this book can be exceedingly valuable as a handbook that covers to do with the information.Prentis HallPresidentThe Industrial Marketing Practice Association..."
1,Managing Customer Value:Creating Quality and Services that Cuatomers Can See,"Unfortunately, this book is not a book that I could recommend. I too am majoring in MAM and this topic was recommended by my professor. If you a a marketing major or work for a large company it may be suited for you. If you are a beginner please find another book.Following along was difficult and could have be made easier to understand.A.MorganAdv. Marketing"
3,"Good system, a few complaints","I got this Powerbook for my wife and I got a new desktop system. I just have a few complaints about this PB:Poor battery life - we only get about 1 hour of use if we are using it. If it's sitting idle the batter last longer, but what good is that?Flimsy case - it's pretty, but we've already scratched it twice and there is a crack on the bottom. This isn't covered by the warranty, but if they are going to use cheap cases they shouldn't charge so much.Things I love - the screen is very nice and I like having a big hard drive. (Despite what people say the drive isn't all that loud so go for a big hard drive.)"
2,First Class Computer -- Need Upgrades for Support,"As other reviewers have stated, the hardware itself is great. The computer is visually stunning. And the OS is rock-solid and user-friendly.Some people have complained about the size for traveling. It's about as small as a 17"" computer could be -- but if you are sitting in coach and the person in front of you reclines their seat, it's hard to use. (Get the 12"" if you think this might be a problem for you.)Finally, a word on Apple service. I had some problems with this computer and needed to send it back to Apple several times -- which is a bad thing. On the other hand, I finally reached Roberto, a Powerbook specialist in AppleCare, who was understanding and expedited my repair -- which is a good thing. 4-stars -- would have been 5-stars except for the hardware problems."
2,PowerBook review,"Unable to use it with Rosetta Stone, which is why I bought it. Also couldn't use it to watch live tv on it, software issue with Microsoft."
2,Short fluffy presentation,"Perhaps half of the 50 minute long presentation actually display Vermeer paintings.The colors of the paintings shown in the video do not faithfully match the actual paintings.The names given the paintings in the video do not always match the common names of the paintings.'A Girl Pouring Milk' of the video is often called 'The Milkmaid' by other presenters.If you don't know who Vermeer was, this may be a pleasant introduction to some of Vermeer's paintings.If you are expecting a scholarly presentation, you are likely to be disappointed."
5,A Great Collection of the Master's Music,"Some of Louis Armstrong's Greatest work is here in one place for the asking. His innovative sound and love for music come alive on this CD. A pleasure for young and old alike, something for the whole family. especially for those who are just starting to listen to jazz!"
4,Extension Cable,The picture is not of this specific cable. The cable is actually an extension cable for the Minnkota integral transducer. It has a round multi-pin screw connector on each end. It allows mounting of the depth finder further away from the trolling motor. I could not find an actual picture of the cable anywhere.
5,Hard to find size at local hardware stores,"I have a 10 yr old screen door that needed the spline replaced. First I tried the largest size that the two big box home improvement stores stocked. Although the size they carried was the same as was originally used in my screen door, it no longer would get a good grip on my screen. I ordered the .250 size and it has worked great. Shipping was a tad slower then I usually expect from Amazon, but not a big deal."
1,There's just no range,"I live in a regular size house, and this phone's range doesn't cover it. I tested it in the 'open air' and the phone was good for maybe 20 feet! And not being able to use both phones at once, clinches this product as the worst phone I'ver ever bought!"
1,Advertised Made In Usa - Actually Made In China,"I'm sick and tired of all the outsourcing of jobs to China and India and I made a conscious decision to buy American. This item is clearly advertised on this website as Made in USA; however, after receiving the phone - the box is clearly stamped Manufactured In China. This is false advertising!!! Therefore, I rate this phone as 1 star and returning the phone."
1,Same hiss issue,"I just picked up the VS3121 set, thinking the $20 after rebate was a great deal. I wish I'd seen these reviews first. All I had to do is plug in the subwoofer (satellites still neatly wrapped in plastic). The hiss was not something I could live with. I'll be returning the set. I think it damages a company's reputation to release a product with that kind of defect."
1,poor quality sound,"they were at a good price, but i guess you get what you pay for. they continually buzzed, the sound quality was poor, they actually picked up a local radio station that you could hear under the buzzing even when the computer was off! I would pay a little more and get speakers you would be happy with. I returned them and I plan on getting something better soon."
2,Mid-bass is unbearable,"There is a particular range of mid-bass frequencies that these speakers cannot reproduce well at all. It is very noticeable when a track or a sound effect hits those frequencies because it sounds horribly harsh and almost garbled. While these speakers look great and are cheap, I would recommend staying away. I bought these on an impulse without looking at the reviews first. I will not do that again."
4,Well I Like Them....,What's the big deal for the $$s????I have them plugged into a Mac Mini and the sound is fabulous what do you cheapskates want for a few bucks?These are good speakers
1,JUNK,"loud hissing sound when plugged in... no matter where you plug in the bass speaker it hisses loudly.Also the little control box that lets you adjust the treble and bass is very very light weight so if you touch the box to adjust the sound it moves..you have to firmly grasp the box to adjust anything.JUNK, regret purchasing."
1,Receives FM station around 92 on the dial,"Luckly I didn't pay more than 20 bucks for these things because that's all they're worth, if that. I'll probably go back to my old speakers and give these to the kids to use for gaming. I use a seperate power strip so I don't have to listen to the radio all the time ,it comes in loud and fuzzy. If I really crank them up you can drown out the interference."
1,Flawed product,"This would be my 4th pair of Altec Lansing speakers that I've bought (my previous being the ACS33, 221, and VS4121). Aesthetically, this is the best Altec Lansing speakers that I've purchased but unfortunately it falls really short on product quality. The subwoofer and satellites make an audible hiss even when the power is completely turned off. I have to physically remove the power cord from the outlet to remove this noise. When I returned this item to the store, they tested and found that the other unit in stock produced the same hiss either on or off. I predict many unhappy returns with this unit."
1,Like they say - hissing,"Sound quality is passable for the price, but right now I can hear a loud hissing (if I get close, it sounds like it might be picking up a radio station) and the speakers aren't even turned on. They're just plugged in. This product is defective right out of the box.I won't be buying from Altec-Lansing anymore. What kind of company ships a product that is so obviously broken? Do they even care?"
2,"Distortion, pics up any ambient electrical noise","My biggest complaint about this is the distortion in the satellite speakers. I did a frequency sweep and the little speakers are basically expected to produce all but the very lowest freuencies. So there is distortion.It picks up all kinds of electrical noise including my cell phone (digital noise).The bass can boom but this might be speaker placement. There is some hiss. The volume knob clicks on and off but the unit doesn't ever go off.It's not an idle threat, I will never buy Altec Lansing again. I thought they were a good brand. Whoever designed this should be pistol-whipped."
1,Picking up 89.3 FM!,"I bought the speakers while living in an apartment and had no issue with them for several months... great sound for a low price! Two weeks ago I moved into my new house and set up the computer. As soon as I plugged in my speakers I started picking up a local classical station and a tremendous amount of static. Even when the volume is turned all the way down, the level of noise in the speaker is CONSTANT... as mentioned by the other reviewers, the only way to eliminate the noise is UNPLUG the speakers. It is so bad that I can hear the station underneath any songs that I try to play!I am now looking for a new set of speakers - oh well!"
1,Garbage!!!!!!!,"I bought this set of speakers about 3 month ago. The sound quality is good, but it makes VERY VERY VERY LOUD hiss sound. Before when I was living in an apartment, it didn't have this loud hiss sound. Now that I moved to a new house, the hiss sound is even louder and STRANGELY, I can hear RADIO (yes, radios)from the 2 satillite speakers. I thought it was the problem of the plugs and wires in my new house, but I was wrong after looking at all the reviews here. I tried everything to solve this problem, now I finally give up. The hiss sound and the radio can only be stopped when I unplug the AC plug out of my Surge protector. The hiss sound is ALWAYS there EVEN I unplug the cord which connected to my sound card. Right after I plug the power cord in the AC outlet, the hiss sound will start again.This is my first time buying Altec Lansing's speaker. I don't think I will buy their speakers EVER again. I should check out Logitech or Creative instead. Money well wasted. :P"
1,Don't buy this item,"I bought this item during the Thanksgiving sale for a discounted price of $19.94 after rebate. I was initially very happy about it, but once I installed it in my room, I just realized I did the biggest mistake in my life. These speakers produce hissing noises even if they are turned off. Apart from that, you can also hear a particular channel of FM radio from the 2 speakers. This noise is constant, and never stops. If you play soft, sentimental slow songs, you'll be able to hear the interference from the FM radio channel. If you play loud heavy metal or rap songs, then it works out fine because the FM radio noises is being covered up by the loud noise from your computer. In a few days, I might just return this speakers. We'll see."
1,Junk,"This 2.1 speaker system is complete junk. They seem to have very good fit & finish, but none of that matters when it's plugged in and loud hissing can be heard across the room. I hooked them up to various sources (i.e. computer, mp3 player and television) and could still hear the hiss over moderate volume levels. Altec Lansing tech support claims that the ""active circuitry"" is responsible for the noise and to unplug them when they're not in use. When I questioned who would live with that inconvenient chore, the tech responded to take them back to the store then. Then I asked whether I should try the other set I purchased and he said not to bother since the hissing is a ""known problem"" for the VS-3121, 2121 and 2120. Altec Lansing intentionally releasing a defective product is inexcusable and I will never buy their products again based on this experience. No wonder Staples was trying to throw these away for $20 a pop over Thanksgiving."
2,"Good intentions, but poor execution.","I like the Altec Lansing brand. But this product should have been refined a little more. Unfortunately, the system suffers from some sort of hissing sound. Although some reviews claim it's very loud, I only notice it when no other electronics are turned on the room (it seems quiet to me). In fact, it is a very subtle white noise. Yet the music and sound over the speakers is far superior to my that of my 4 year old notebook. One other note, the system seems to be incredibly sensitive to electronic intereference; i.e. a cell phone, external hd. These problems were solved by moving devices away. Needless to say, these speakers sound great, but come with drawbacks. I suggest buying them only at a bargain price from a store with a ""generous"" return policy."
1,UNBEARABLE hiss!!,"Like a few other reviewers, I bought these speakers during a thanksgiving sale, and even after the drastic discount they aren't worth it. These speakers should have been discontinued for the MAJOR flaw in their constantly hissing, even with power off and all inputs on mute. Don't waste your money on these speakers for ANY price. I plan on returning them."
1,Same problem as everyone else,"I have had these speakers for a while and didn't look into the problem - now I see everyone else has the same problem. For me, the buzz comes only with cell phones ""nearby"". The problem is it's not just my cell phone, which I can move across the room, although this is annoying. I live in a condo building, and even when the upstairs neighbor gets ""in range"" of these speakers, my speakers make noise. I can't believe they sell this product - I didn't pay $20 unfortunately, I believe I paid $40 or $50. On a happy note, the sound quality is quite good, and when they are playing music and no one with a phone is nearby, they are decent speakers. But the inconvenience far outweighs any benefits. Many people want to look up a phone number on their desktop, then make a call from their cell phone. That is impossible with this set of speakers."
2,No Tide ultrasonic cleaning fluid included in the starter kit-- what WERE the marketing folks thinking??,"Just a caution that when buying this kit you must order the cleaning fluid separately as an extra purchase. A sample does NOT come with the kit, just the empty blue cleaning fluid container which appears to be the cleaning fluid--wrong-o!This omission was an serious marketing blunder. I was so ready to start wiping out stains right then and there. Instead I must wait for the cleaning fluid to arrive. Sure hope it works when my cleaner arrives."
4,Fantastic book that goes beyond part 1,"Part 1 was helpful, this one really answers a lot of questions. my only gripe? Most of the code has never been tested-- it's obvious from reading it that it won't work, and if you try to compile and run it, well-- if programmers were civil engineers, this code would make you an amputee. Aside from that, it's a good book."
3,"Some Gripes, But Overall Good","I have a few gripes with the book. It falls short in some areas, has some broken code, descriptions could be a bit better in certain areas, and the accompanying CD is poorly laid out. Overall though it's easy to read with a good number of witty comments from the author and it covers a lot of areas of TGE programming. If you own TGE then this book is probably worth investing in."
1,Not a Beginners Guide?,You will find the on-line documentation at Garage Games more helpful.A beginners guide it is not. Code is too buggy.A Torque reference? Not exactly. It tells you what tools you can use with the Torque engine but the Torque parts themselves are to buggy especially if you are new to programming.The code very seldom works without tweaking. You better have programming knowledge if you want to tweak the bad code.It is good as a general reference book for people who want to know what kind of tools to use for programming and what are some of the components for developing a game.Can you go from start to finish and develop a working demo from the book or one of your own? Not unless you are an intermediate to advanced programmer.
2,Trial version software,"Book explains the basic's about making programs such as games! BUT SOFTWARE INCLUDED WITH BOOK, is ONLY TRIAL VERSION OF 30 DAYS --UNLESS YOUR PRO! SOME of the game making tools you CAN'T access. BOOK STATES ALL IN ONE, BUT information isn't all in book!"
