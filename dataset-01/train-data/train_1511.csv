5,Juicer,This cutter wheel made our old juicer like new again. It saved us from having to buy a new one.
4,Hollow Reed,"Warm and touching,proving that gay fathers do have many fears in countries that are bigotted against them, but the strenth of this father overcomes the fears and makes him a stonger person for protecting his son. It is a postive look at gay life you won't regret seeing it"
2,Sticky Sweet Stevia... Yuck!,"I don't understand the American sweet tooth, particularly related to heath food. This Green Foods powder is among the sweetest I have tasted, with an abundance of stevia, licorice, and fruit powders. Horrible. I would rather have a green formula that tastes like greens."
2,Doesnt work consistently,"I would say if your cakes coming out perfectly is important, stick with the shortening and flour method. The first time I used this product the cake released great, but when I tried it with other cakes (different recipes) huge chunks of cake clung to the sides and bottom of pan. After turning over another ruined cake this weekend, I just threw the can away. Its tempting to use it since it is so fast and convenient, but I just cannot trust it. I make many perfectly smooth buttercream and also fondant covered cakes and so I need my cakes to release perfectly every time.I was drawn to this product as it doesnt contain hydrogenated oils. It even advertises that on the can, which I find interesting since Wilton freely uses hydrogenated oils in many of thier products.I will stick with shortening, flour, and parchment liners. Its extra work, but at least you can count on it working."
1,What's Up Amazon?,"Amazon would now allow me to leave delivery feedback because the item was never delivered, which is the issue. I ordered this item along with three other items. The other three items were delivered, but I received a notice that this was ""undeliverable"" because something was wrong with my address--like it didn't exist or something like that--so they returned it and refunded my money. Well, okay. I'm just curious how Amazon has found me all these years."
2,Not the best,"As much of a Wilton fan as I am, this is not a good product. The bottom of my cakes get too greasy and stick to the pan. Either use the Pam version which contains flour, or stick to the old grease and flour routine."
3,Just Okay,"This stuff doesn't seem to really work much (if any) better than regular non-stick spray (Pam, etc.)."
5,good,"My Doctor suggested these and they work wonders for me. However, they have many uses and all Homeopathy products should be suggested by a Doctor or researched fully before taking."
2,Buyer Beware - This is a tiny book,"I just wanted to note for potential buyers that this is not a book. It's only 90 pages long, written like a play script:Hitler: Why is that?Jesus: Because of such and suchHitler: But what about so and so?I am a very slow reader and read this entire pamphlet in about 40 minutes. While I enjoyed the content, I guess that Mr. Zacharias wrote a bunch of other books just like this as well and instead of putting them all together to make one book (and charge one book price), they kept them all separated out and charged a full book price for each one of them.The content itself is enjoyable, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one."
3,Good but a little disappointing,"As with any book or movie or song or anything else where the author plays the role of Jesus/God and is speaking for Him without using the Bible the task is very difficult. For the most part I feel as though Ravi Zacharias did a good job of this. However, this book was a little disappointing to me. It just seems to me that the conversation between Hitler and Jesus went in a direction I never expected it to go. Historical points are touched on through out and Hitler's part is done ok. I do wish however that the Jesus of the book would have used more scripture and less Ravi-Speak.Still a pretty good book and I recommend those who love to read, read it. It's a great transition book between two long books you may be reading."
1,Not the Right Order,"Was not the chicken and rice that I ordered once before. The balls were bigger, very hard and darker in color - like they were made of other meat maybe beef or duck, it was not the chicken. They are light colored as shown in the picture.My dog is tiny and couldn't eat them so I cut them up and still she was not happy with them ,kind of ate some of it BOOOO!!!Would like to order more of the original ones I purchased that were smaller but am afraid will get wrong ones again."
5,Tasty Treats for my little puppies,My puppies (5 months old) absolutely LOVE these. They play with them for a little and chew chew chew!!! And being that the ingredients are chicken breast and rice only (no sugar or other fillers) I feel comfortable letting them enjoy it.
2,so-so,"my 3- and 4- yr olds liked this globe quite a bit before they became discouraged with the difficulty in understanding the voice commands and with the tracker pole not going all the way up to the top. now they refer to it as ""the globe we liked but doesn't work"". i'd spend a little more (the kids seem to love the concept) and get one that functions more smoothly (it is difficult to stop, start, and generally maneuver)."
4,fun toy for little ones,"my sons liked this toy. always fun to fly a plane, and they get to learn a little about geography too. they always tended to turn it into a contest to land on the same animal or location every time - whichever one they liked the most, but I guess that was also good for memory, and also coordination to steer the plane to the right place. a little bit flimsy, but still fun. ours never broke, but the stick got loose where the plane would drop to the bottom instead of staying at a certain height when you let go of the stick, but not an issue since usually the kids are steering it up/down anyway, and it only fell to bottom when they let go of the stick, basically never while they were playing."
5,Great gift for my wife.,This is a very pleasant perfume. I first bought it for my wife about 8 years ago for a Mother's Day gift while we were living in Germany. She loves it. I started purchsing more bottles for her and her friends every time I made a trip to Europe. But now I found that I can convienently purchase it on Amazon.
5,love it,"I love this perfume. I've been using it for years. It is a good scent for evenings not so much for day time, but you could pull off the day time wear with this. It is not like the channel 5's or something very perfumy, it had much more of a natural smell, somewhat sweet & musky. I love it!"
3,Very good CD. Dragonflies should be top 10!,"Povi is a lot like Portishead and Massive Attack, if those bands weren't so downbeat. There's much more of a pop sound here, although not schlocky. Like an artier Morcheeba.I can't understand why ""Dragonflies"" isn't on the charts! It's an incredible song! Most of the rest of the CD can't match it, but it doesn't pale by comparison either. There are lots of styles (pop, trip-hop, instrumental) merged into a unique sound that flows through all the tracks, marking them as Povi. The lyrics are very well-written, and I hope their future CDs reprint them in the jewel case.Even though the last couple of tracks veer off into self-indulgent and self-pitying goo, the majority of this CD is really intriguing. I will definitely keep my ears open for more."
4,Life in Volcanoes,"A onetime collaboration between Australian vocalist Cristina Calero and L.A.-based electronic producer Carmen Rizzo, Life in Volcanoes alternates between amiable pop (""Dragonflies"") and more atmospheric trip-hop excursions (""1st Day of Spring"", ""Other People Sleep""). Povi do both equally well, and surprisingly, the album manages to remain engaging despite its middling brightness levels. Calero's new age poetry, delivered in a constantly mutating but always sexy croon, is exquisitely complimented by Rizzo's musical backdrops--a sort of wet, marshy sound that transports the listener to the center of a buzzing bayou. No paradigms are shattered, obviously, and those jaded by a certain stripe of syrupy trip-hop may be a little bored, but the record serves as a solid addition to the genre and demonstrates how vital it can be when left in the hands of people who clearly enjoy what they're doing."
3,"Interesting, elusive music","It's difficult to put your finger on this one. I picked up the album after it was described as a mixture of modern rock, trip-hop, and electronica, and it certainly is all three, but I find it yet difficult to classify. Many songs almost smack of conventionality, but there's always something a little different about Povi that throws it off. None of the songs attracted wild enthusiasm from me, but they were all well done. I'll be interested to see what their next album holds, for Povi has a lot of promise."
3,Okay,"This is a good book, especially when it got to the nineteenth century. My only complaint is that it barely says anything about ancient Axum (thats like writing a history of Italy but skipping over the Roman empire). The text also seemed to focus on Ethiopia's connection with the rest of the world, rather than focusing on Ethiopia's history and the Ethiopian people themselves (that is , their culture). An imformative read but hardly the kind of info I expected."
2,flat,ive listened to a lot of benny goodman and i like him especialy with charlie christian. this cd i find a bit flat and lifeless though. his playing has lost its easy fluidity to my ears compaired to his earlier stuff
4,Fooled by box into seeing a great movie.,"I rented this movie to see a story about a child and a murder. It is there, but wrapped around the story is the dysfunctional family and the stress of a normal shy boy who suddenly quits talking. Great show and a movie experience that I can say I am glad to have seen with my wife."
5,Very Moving,Love this movie. It is very moving and compelling. Based on a true story. The actors are extremely convincing.
5,the silent adventures of afro child,"holy SMOKESSSSS!!!!!!! what a tale! what a truely unique adventure! not only does it wisp us away into a world of silence but into a world of little kids who can't talk!!! the child's ""afro"" reminded me of the many tangles and turmoils of life. but his sweet innocent ""face"" reasured me that all was well. this movie pointed out the ultimate truth more accurately than any of its kind- namely that nothing draws a family closer than a murdering police officer. nine thumbs up!!! may this movie be forever ""locked"" in our hearts."
2,was nice when it was intact,"i think i might have gotten a defective one or something, because it worked for about a week, got to listen to my music and hear phone calls coming inbut then the wires started to come apart and breaking, and i didn't treat it roughly, just stuck it in my pocket with my phone"
2,"Legends of Punk? Maybe in person, but not sound...","I was honestly let down by this record. Even though it's marketed as the ""legends of punk"", the sound is everything but. It's very bubble-gum pop and doesn't have any aggression behind it. I did get a kick out of the ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" cover simply because I'm a fan of the Coen brother's film ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?."" But other than that, ""punk"" is only in the musician's resumes rather than the sound.If you really want to hear it, I'd recommend buying used. It's not up to snuff for full price."
5,Wonderful book,"I too had this book as a college text book, over 20 years ago (copyright date 1983)! and I am still using it as a reference to this day. Easy to understand, lots of examples, and well organized. I even have mine signed by Rachel as I worked with her many years ago!"
3,Got the message,This is the second of his books that I have read. I enjoyed and was more inspired by the Ragamuffin Gospel. The Importance of Being Foolish seemed to me to be more preachy and repetitive. I will still continue to read this author's other books. His style is easy and his background - where he is coming from - helps my understanding immensely.
4,Good for beginners and intermediates,"This book has a lot of information about 3D Studio Max R3 which would be fairly useful for beginners and intermediate users, but not so much for the advanced users. There were some examples in here which were new to me, but I really didn't get as much out of this book as I was hoping. Regardless, if you are just getting into 3DSMax this is still a good book to checkout."
3,Missing files!,"It's a good book for people who know a little bit about Max. BUT I'm missing a lot of files !!! Every file you covered in the book is missing, except for the files of chapter 14 and further Please tell me where I can find these files !!!!"
2,"Missing files, Complete Confusion!","Ok, so I bought Mastering Maya Complete and was happy with it. Yeah, great. Then I thought, hmmm, maybe this Max book will be as good as the Maya book. WRONG! First of all, any file before chapter 13 is missing from the CD. Way to go! I was totally and utterly confused, because the author does not keep in mind that it's not as easy to find buttons and menus when you're a beginner, and don't know where they are actually located! Yes, it covers a lot. Yes, it has a pretty cover. But the bottom line, Chris Murray should be fired. Book is terrible."
3,A Little Tomiki Aikido,"The video is an incredibly small view of Tomiki Aikido. The tape is under 18 minutes in length. There is less than 13 minutes of actual video footage, of which 3 minutes shows Judo students doing basic Judo, only about 30 seconds of Tomiki Sensei here. The almost 9 minutes of Tomiki Sensei doing Aikido is very good, but is nothing special."
4,"Great topic, poorly written","Donna J. Kossy has picked a fabulous topic to write on, however, her writing style comes across as flat and methodical. Fortunately the subject matter stands on its own. For me nothing illustrates the power that science exerts in our society like seeing how it is misinterpreted and scewed to fit religous belief. People like Paul Laffoley also illustrate the fine line walked between madness and genius."
3,Maybe its the times...,"Parts of this were funny. It may have been much funnier before Sept 11th. Carlin's main points were.1. Distrust the government, their answer to everything is to bomb ""brown people"".2. Carlin hates it when people show the flag and be patriotic.3. Carlin says he only likes watching the news when thousands of people are killed when buildings explode, bodies falling, fire, etc etc. HIGHLY UNFORTUNATE CHOICE OF WORDS. Plus this was in New York, and he says ""if 6,000 people die in Pakistan, who cares, I would only care if it happened in my backyard!""I watched this with 8 people, and the entire hour of Jammin in New York was just us gasping. If he were to do the same act today, he'd have to drop 95% of the jokes.Just writing this as a warning. It still had funny parts, but be prepared!"
3,Jammin,Jammin is better than doin it again for sure. Recorded a while back but still relevant though don't expect great picture/ recording quality.
5,TWO GREAT SETS FROM THE HILARIOUS GEORGE CARLIN!,"I'm glad I picked this up when I could,it is now out of print and this is some great stuff here! This plus the two earlier box sets complete the older Carlin stuff,but I think George is just getting better with age."
5,George Carlin Rocks!!!!!!,"I have had mp3s of George Carlin's routine, but that is only a shadow of what watching him do the same routines is. I could not stay in my chair I was laughing so hard. Also the movements of his hands and face add to the merriment a thousand fold, perhaps more. I would reccommend this double HBO special disc of his to anyone who has only listened to George thus far."
5,Rock Art,"Benz does an incredible job of presenting suiseki in a lovely format with loads of pictures of beautiful suiseki. He also provides the aesthetic and practical levels of the ancient art; right down to the tools need and the frame of mind needed to explore this art. Whether you are a beginner or long time collector, you will find this book a worthy addition to your library. I read the book today and I'm on my way out to the mountains to find a new stone tomorrow."
1,sukky toy,this toy falls apart easily and it is so boring that u will fall asleep when playing it!!!do not get it.
1,Did not work good,"I have used this product for 2 years, the first year I thought it did have some effect on the odor of the water as my dogs were not as stinky but did not see any effect on the muck. This year, I literally used this every week all summer, it did absolutely nothing...the dogs were as stinky as ever and no noticed effect on the muck. I wouldn't waste your time with it."
5,"Big, Cool Frog Pictures","This fun little book is filled with big, detailed image of frogs from every stage, from egg to frog, It does an excellent job at showing the different levels of growth of tadpoles. There are some nice shots of tadpoles with legs starting to sprout.There are no more than 16 words per page, making it reader-friendly for ages 5-7.I fully recommend ""Where Do Frogs Come From.""Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"
5,"Great Book for Young Children - a review of ""Where Do Frogs Come From""","This is an excellent science book for young children. At each turn of the page they will find clear, bright, interesting photos that demonstrate the growth cycle of our amphibian friends.The text is good. The sentences are simple and clear and easily understandable by toddlers on up. (A good read-aloud.)Amazon has the reading age as 4 to 8, but the book is *Level 2*, which the book itself suggests for children in the 6-8 age range.Five Stars. We like this little book. Good Read-aloud. Good information. Pictures and information appeal to all ages whether they can read or not. [They really did manage to find very attractive frogs-lol]"
4,a good book,"One of the better CoDominium stand alone books in the ""history"". It gives a pretty interesting story and a believeable example of what a little bit of teck can do if put to good use."
2,Ouch!,"This mouse is way too small (and I have small hands, so I can imagine what a pain it is for someone with larger hands), so part of your hand is always kind of raised up, creating strain on the hand and up into the arm (when used for a longer period of time). I've been using it on a desk and I've needed to get a mouse pad for traction because the mouse cursor doesn't stay in one place, making the cursor move all over the page/screen. Better off getting another mouse."
4,Good mouse but a few steps back,I preferred the older version for:1. better finger traction on the wheelI find it harder to engage and increased pressure sometimes resultsin a middle-click being recorded2. better hand ergonomicsIt just doesn't feel as comfortable (a larger bump towards the backwould provide better palm support)3. matte surface more difficult to cleanPrevious version had a shiny surface that was much easier to clean.
2,Just take a fullsize mouse,"It's worth it just to take a regular size optical mouse with you. This one doesn't save that much space. It works fine, but it's not comfortable to use."
3,"Looks cute, but hurts your hand","This mouse looks adorable; it's optical, light and good for on the go notebook computer owners. But this mouse causes much discomfort and slight pain to the rist; it is enormously uncomfortable if working with it for hours."
2,good mouse- except didn't last long,"I used this mouse on my laptop, and it ran very well, no major complaints. I'm a designer, and work closely and very intense in photohop, dreaweaver and other goodies. HOWEVER, it just died. RIP.... ; ( i'm little disappointed. I only had it for 6 months. I'm not sure what the life expectency of a optical mouse? I'm hoping I still have my papers and box. I will attempt to send for a warrenty refund. I probably wont buy another, due to the fact, i'm VERY impaitent, and I need a more reliable mouse."
4,Good mouse,"This is a good mouse. I have it for over one year already, and it still works perfectly. I use it over different surfaces, like bed, sofa, wood floor, my desk, dinning table, etc, and it works fine and accurately.A little complaint: I know it's a mouse for laptop, but I would be happier if the cord was a little bit longer. I normally plug this into the USB at the back of the laptop. With a short cord, the mouse can't really have some big movement."
4,Microsoft Notebook Optical Mouse (Black ) by Microsoft,IT'S THE BEST MOUSE I'VE EVER BOUGHT EASY TO HANDLE AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR LAPTOPS. THE SERVICE WAS FAST AND I'M PLEASE WITH IT ALL. THANKS.
4,Great music,"Chicane has not released this track on an album as they did with their previous albums. You heard this track on the radio trying to ascertain from music shops when the new Chicane album is due for release, without success. At last I found it on Amazon! The last new one left! Thank you Amazon!"
2,Not the best,"Rico Royal used to be an excellent brand for soprano reeds. It seems that somewhat recently they have started using their regular rico reeds and branding them as Rico Royal, which are barely decent and really bad on the high notes."
4,"Great product, but very powerful!","This stuff is great, but do be careful! It will take the skin off your hand as easily as your feet, so be sure to wash your hands after applying. I'll be honest, this is the only product I've ever used that actually made my feet look and feel better. Definitely a go!"
4,one of the few things that work,"I've always had problems with rough heels and by staying after it, I can have really healthy skin. This is one of two or three products that really work for me.Pros - works within about a week to restore healthy skin. Softens the dry cracked skin at the heels, especially if/when I soak my feet for 15 minutes prior to using Kerasal. For me, this softens callouses too but does not totally remove them.Cons - very greasy and requires socks worn to bed.I also use a Electric Callus Remover which has been excellent in keeping the skin healthy.Pleased with this product and recommended."
1,Wouldn't recommend this product at all.,"I followed the directions and used this product for two full weeks. I saw absolutely no change at all in the dry skin on my heels. I noticed the info on the box stated it could be returned to the address given for a refund. I sent the original receipt in with the product & price circled. Two weeks later I received back the padded envelope I used with the post office sticker on it stating that it was not deliverable as addressed! I double checked the address I had used and it matched the one on the back of the box exactly. I not only blew the $9.00 on the product, I blew the $1.95 to mail it along with the .95 for the envelope! I am not a happy camper and feel totally ripped off!"
5,Needed,This book is essential if you wish to beat Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty. Trust me I have tried without the guide and I could not even get past the first mission. Although I have not beaten the game yet I soon will.
2,"More matter, less art.....","I wanted to like this book. I wanted to get swept up in Trewin's remembrances of five and eighty Hamlets. Instead, I found myself struggling through all sorts of ""trivial fond recall,"" just to mine a few nuggets. As a much more satisfying book, I recommend Michael Pennington's ""Hamlet: A User's Guide."""
3,"Good, but buy old stuff first!","this cd is pretty good, but get ""music"" and ""grassroots"" they are AWESOME! 311 ROCKS!"
5,Keepin it simple.,"Buy the cd, it is a combo of all their work, and it's awesome. LONG LIVE LITTLE PUD."
5,"Another great one from the best band in the word, 311!","311 does it again with Soundsystem. With the exception of Transistor, this is their best effort yet. This is a great album to sit and space out to. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED."
3,"A nice effort , but...","311 have a wonderfully unique sound, and are always able to produce several ""killer"" songs per album-- in this case ""Come Original"", ""Flowing"", ""Mindspin""-- but they consistently fail to produce a ""complete"" product, a fact which I find incredibly frustrating. This group is so fresh, even they are unable to harness their musical potential. Bottom line-- I will continue to buy everything they produce, but I'll never quit hoping for the ""grand prize""...Better luck next time"
2,Five stars??? Not even close...,"I reviewed this album earlier and gave it 3 stars because I thought it was pretty mediocre. Then, on a long car trip I listened to it again carefully, and must unfortunately downgrade my rating. In reality, this really isn't a very good album. There simply isn't much catchy or memorable stuff on this record. Everything sounds the same; no track leaps out and grabs you (except maybe Come Original).I have the tape, and the whole first side is basically forgettable. A couple of decent songs salvage the second side, but nothing that special. And I LIKE 311!!!! But compared to earlier efforts, this one is just plain weak. I think many of you gave this album 5 stars out of fan loyalty to the band, which is cool. But if you were truly honest, you would see that this is a rather disappointing effort from a group of talented guys who are capable of much more."
3,"Good, not great","Before anyone gets on me, i have been a LOYAL 311 fan since their opening days in Omaha. However, when i bought this cd i was a litttttlllle disappointed. I think this cd contains one of 311's best in Come Original. But lots of the other songs are lack the 311 intensity. Lots of the songs sound like they old rocking beats but with slow and meaningless lyrics. But this is still one of the better cds i have gotten. but if you want a GREAT 311 cd, buy music or 311."
5,311 still kicking ass!,this is a kick ass cd with good songs. and every 311 fan or music fan should get this great cd.
3,Getting better the more i listen,"I was hoping this would be another Grassroots or 311 but its not. It doesnt have the bite that songs like down and homebrew or even beautiful disater. but come original isnt a bad song and sever is pretty good. it doesnt have that metal heavy guitar rock sound that 311 and grassroots had. i hated it when i first bought it but the more i am listening the more i am liking. but as of now it seems they came original, but they didnt come 311."
5,311 still Rockin',"I got this CD as an advanced release in Japan on October 1st. I was listening to it all the way back to the states and fell in love with it. I already had all their previous albums and was really looking forward to this and its everything I hoped it'd be. My least favorite album of them all is Transistor but don't get me wrong, I love the album but Soundsystem just blows it away by far. This is a must have for anyone, 311 fan or not."
5,Album of the Year,"This album has the flavor of both ""older"" and new 311. It's sounds like there was much effort put into the making of this record, not something that was pieced together. An excellent display of each member of 311's talent as musicians. Once again, a record and sound that no other band can duplicate. I recommend this record to any 311 fan."
3,sub-par,"this cd is one of their worst cds. the music and lyrics are slow and mellow like incubus. the only good songs are freeze time, can't fade me, mindspin, and livin & rockin. if u plan on buying this,u should consider buying grassroots or their self titled album."
2,311 Has Lost It,"Trying to impress the critical mass of blink 182 adolescent fans and the likes, three eleven has failed to re-create the attitude felt in earlier albums. Gone is their ever-popular drug influenced tracks and now present are poppy boy-band esque songs of hum-worthy melodies. This just wont do it for me driving in my car going ninety. It may help if im driving past the local mall trying to pick up thirteen year olds however. I suggest Transistor, dubbed the ""stoney"" album or Grassroots, their best ever effort and collaboration on a disc to date."
3,Mediocre - 2 and a half for strong musical performance,"However, it does have ""Eons"" and ""Flowing,"" two of my favorite 311 songs. The music is strong dynamically, but it is basically the same as all their other albums. Only not as good; I find rapper SA's vocals to be annoying, not sounding anywhere as good as they did on Transistor, which I believe to have the best perfomances from him. The lyrics are pretty mediocre. Save for 5 or 6 songs, not to great of an album. It all right, but now worth purchasing.Here is my opinion on their albums, from best to worst:1) Grassroots2) From Chaos3) Transistor4) 3115) Evolver6) Soundsystem - this oneI don't have Music, but I've heard nothing but good things about it."
5,typical 311... ROCKS,311 has put out another masterful album. the band continues to set the standard for cutting edge music. this cd rivals that of music and grassroots. a definite purchase
5,Perfection,"Every single one of 311's albums is awesome. NOBODY has a smoother voice than Nick. Martinez spits out rad harmonies. They're music makes you get up out of your seat. You can feel the music, not just hear it. Of course, every album has my top three songs, but it by no means implicates the others aren't good. ""Come Original""....Awesome, ""Creatures"" is my anthem. If you want a skin & mind tingling experience listen to ""Beyond the Gray Sky"" which is on one of the other albums. The Don't tread On Me album has more of a ska feel to it which is really cool, however I do wish Martinez was less prominent in the vocals. It seemed like he was pushing in on Nick's territory. Stick with what you do well, Martinez, which is backround harmonies; I like ya but you start to sound whiny the louder you get. Wanna go to the bestr concert of your life? Catch an outdoor show. Rock On!"
3,I expected it to be somewhat like the blue album,"I am a pretty good 311 fan. This album has the same sound as Transistor ( 4 stars). This album like Transistor has a lot of variety in it. It would have probably have gotten 4 stars if it had more then thirteen songs of different variety. See, I really liked the songs where they used the guitar. So overall this cd has about 7 rock songs and everything else is a combo. Transistor was the same thing. Instead about 13 rock songs."
4,311 Keeps It Real,"After Transistor I wouldn't of known what to expect from 311. Transistor had its moments but it was recorded too fast and I believe alot of marajuana was involved in the process. 311 hit back with Soundsystem a postively charged album heading into the 21st century. 311 has always in their lyrics tried to stay positive and in Soundsystem there isn't any let down in that. SA raps with more fuel for the fire this time round and scratches it up on the turntables quite well. Pnut beats that thing more then usual and the result is pure genius. Chad on drums is the standout, i think, on the album. Tim is always there with killer riffs and Nick well Nick is Nick his melodic vocal styling is unique and is matched well with SA's rapping skills. All in all Soundsystem is a excellent record with all their styles on one CD. You'll be quite interested in the way they start a couple of their songs with techno beats, but thats only the start."
5,Classic 311 and then Some....,"We all know 311 are open marijuana smokers right?.....Well What I think they did for this album is take the self titled CD and Transistor and roll them up in one PHAT joint! This CD is tight! Perfect combonation of reggae, ska, rock, punk, and DJing. Here are the best songs: ""Freeze Time""- Its just cool... ""Come Original""- shows how well 311 can flow... ""Large In the Margin""- Perfect combo of driving guitars and light vocals... ""Flowing""- Light but cool; shows the reggae ablility... ""Can't Fade Me""- cool song and the singers are almost rapping.... ""Evolution"" Love this song for its sic drum intro... ""Livin and Rockin"" This is the fastest song and it is so energizing its amazing! I definitely recommend this CD...and to any of the reviewers who said this stuff is unoriginal or bad...you gotta check your head cuz 311 provides some of the most innovative music out there. BUY IT!!!!!!"
4,promises to be another great 311 CD,"Come original is a tight song, and backed up well. they keep their fast beat that has worked so well in the past. A great album"
5,GREAT!!!!!!,"I am a huge 311 fan but dont let that make you think im just putting this great review because of that...i got the cd on opening day, i have been waiting on this cd to come out for 2 years and its been worth every day waiting...!!!!get the cd today!!!!! this is the best 311 cd there is and thats saying a lot! i love the cd..."
1,wwwwhhhhhhaaattttttt happened?,"what happened to 311. i used to love them up until transister came out. this album is very different than the first 3 albums. the distortion is very heavy. s.a. doesn't get much time on this album either. i would not recomend this album unless you've heard your friends. sorry guys, maybe next time."
1,Gross lyrical incompetence and turgid music,"Exactly why so many people rave about 311 is completely beyond me. They appear to be little more than Rage Against The Machine, but without the rage. The music does not 'rock'; it's unbelievably boring and conservative on the whole with the odd unsuccessful foray into reggae. The lyrics are comically bad, although you should probably expect that from a band with a song called 'Largin' in the Margin'. Even the sleeve is utterly foul. No redeeming features whatsoever."
2,Transistor? minus Excitement and Motivation,This is a lot like transistor except it's missing the serious flow. These songs might have been left overs or something. 311 sounds like they are just goofing off.
2,Pretty average CD.,"This is my first purchase of a 311 CD, and I didn't really know what to expect from it. I like to buy a new band once in a while to expand the music library. So I am not a ""previously hooked"" follower of this band and am basing my review of this CD on this release alone.If I had only listened to this CD once, I would have given it a 1 star rating... At first it comes off pretty simple and repetitive. The biggest problem I had with this CD is how the guitarist and drummer get stuck into ""power chord/bass drum"" ruts, where they mimic each other in mid-tempo land for entire song after song. Being a fan of musical creativity, this doesn't do much for me at all....Luckily, I gave it a second and third listen. The extra listen boosted this CD up to 2 stars, mostly because of the 13th track ""Liven and Rockin"", that does have a cool ""living color - Cult of personality"" style riff through the chorus.Pretty basic stuff here overall....."
5,They just can't stop rockin,"I own every 311 cd there is, and this one is by no means a dissappointment. I""m not going to say it's my favorite, because every cd of theirs is my favorite. 311 is truly one of the most talented bands i've had the luck to listen to. I put them in a catagory with led zepplin and eric clapton. Their lead guitarist,Tim Mahoney, has an unmatched stylo =) and creativeness. Chad sexton is absolutely awesom on the drums, and of course SA and nick make the perfect hip-hop reagge combo. Everyone of 311's cd's are one of a kind. They mix so many styles, and play them all well. And their good vibes and positive attitude is a much better alternative to some other modern band's complaining and critizing. buy this cd. you won't regret it!"
5,Im still dancin'!,Okay guys.. buy this cd. It's stellar! COME ORIGIONAL is just as catchy (or maybe more) as thier hit DOWN. YAY 311!
4,Party time!!!,"""Soundsystem"" is probably 311's most fun record. Even though it begins with the off-kilter riffing of the excellent ""Freeze Time,"" ""Come Original"" comes next and quickly establishes ""Soundsystem"" as a fun, breezy but deep album; just 311 being 311. ""Life's Not a Race"" gives Tim Mahoney a chance to step out on the guitar, and has a cool, jazzy/Santana-esque vibe to it. ""Evolution"" has some tight riffing and clever lyrics, ""Flowing"" is a classic 311 tune: a poppy and heavily distorted section gives way to a metallic, heavily palm-muted, chromatic ascending riff. Great singing too. And ""Livin' & Rockin'"" closes things out with an uptempo bang.""Soundsystem"" is a great, fresh and fun offering from 311. It's like a 13-track party with 5 of the coolest dudes you know."
3,this album didn't impress me too much,"don't get me wrong, 311 is my favorite band and I love everything that they do but I believe this album wasn't that great compared to some of their others. people have told me that they like this album the best and I respect that. But for me it just lacked something that their other albums had. When I heard this it wasn't really anything new or special. The songs were not very original, the lyrics were poorly written, and the arrangements and guitar were only average. After coming off of Transistor which was new and different 311 wanted to get back into the type of style that was apparent on the blue album. However, I feel they could have done more and made it better. I look forward to their new album in 2001 which will be their best one yet."
5,Explosive hooks with soothing sounds.,311 once again has came original! The band stays with their trademark sound and doesn't sell out.
2,A poor effort from a good band.,"I dig 311, but face it...this one's a stinker. Each song sounds like the next, which would be OK if the songs were any good. Guys, think about hanging it up."
5,These Guys Dominate!,"Who ever Paul Kendall is has obviosly never seen 311 live! Otherwise he would have know that 311 is the most far from ""dull and boring"" that I've ever seen. This album is fantastic! My first 311 album was ""Grassroots,"" which is also a masterpiece in itself, but ""Soundsystem"" is equally as good, if not better. My personal favorite is ""Largin' the Margin,"" because of its constant key changes and interesting transitions. The lyrics may not be as deep as what you may be expexting, but 311 is all about having fun, and getting along with each other to keep the world at peace. If you want something deeper, I recomend 311's ""Transistor."" These guys just rock, and if you feel like you want to give something new and interesting a try, I suggest this album."
4,This is 311's best,"It's all good. Leadin' off with ""freeze time"" (which set the mood for this totally chill cd), the first 4 jams make this a cd you must not be without. This is 311's best."
4,Don't count them out just yet...,"After their self-titled release, 311 follwed up with ""Transistor""--the CD which lost them fans and left the critics saying, ""They're done for"". Now comes ""Soundsystem"", 311's statement to the music industry that they won't go down without a fight. Soundsystem has all the potential hit songs that made the self-titled release so popular. I had to laugh at an earlier customer review that labeled them ""so unoriginal""--as if any other band BUT 311 revolutioned hip-hop/metal/reggae. While the brilliantly mixed ""Come Original"" will sell the album, ""Large in the Margin"" or ""Flowing"" could very well steal your heart as favorite song on the CD. The harmony in ""Large In the Margin""'s chorus will blow your mind. ""Freeze Time"" also gets a big thumbs up in my book. The whole CD is 311's return to musical greatness and will save the band from extinction."
5,this album rocks,this ablum is so cool i mean all the new stuff us 311 fans have been waiting for and then some. They throw in new stuff but still give us the stuff we're used to like come original(the new single) and then they give us lARGE IN THE MARGIN AND EONS damn caps the undoubtedly two best songs on the album with both the old and the new so quick buy it before they run out!
5,Been A Fan/Always A Fan,This is the best 311 CD I have heard to date. I have been a 311 fan since the first album! These guys roll with me almost anywhere I go. People know good music when they pull up beside my car pumpin these funky fresh beats of 311!
2,"rockin', but not as much soul","ever since music i have been a *huge* 311 fan. i think their sound is incredibly innovative. this album has less of the cool, loose grooves that the earlier stuff had, though. less of Hexum's smooth raps. some of the melodies almost border on corny, too (the chorus on flowing sounds like green day. gag.). there are definitely some fantastic bits on this disk (the eons riff, the bad brains cover, i particularly dig the sexton and mahoney tunes), and i'm glad i bought it, but i don't think there's as much soul in this album as there was in music and grassroots. hey, but I expect to be absolutely blown away when it comes to 311."
2,too much smoke,"While this book got good reviews, I found it a little hard spending the entire book in a forest fire. It was too long for me without a change of scene. I began to feel a little trapped myself. Also, there were a lot of people in a cramped space and I was having a hard time keeping track of all their names. I like Nevada Barr, but not this time."
3,Mount Lassen?,"I'm a fan of the Anna Pigeon series, in part because of the settings. Firestorm was the first of Barr's books set in a park I'm familiar with - I climbed Mt. Lassen when I was 12 and, although I live in WV now, I revisited the park as recently as 2008. I would have been there last summer (09) except that a forest fire (sound familiar?) diverted me away from the park entrance.That being said, you can understand why I was looking forward to Firestorm. Unfortunately, the story didn't take advantage of the setting; in fact, the connection between the story and Lassen NP was minimal. Yes, a hot spring is part of the plot, but the various thermal features aren't what set Lassen apart. To tell the truth, the story - exactly as it was written - could be shifted to Yellowstone without only minimal editorial adjustments. So I was disappointed, but not so much that I've abandoned Anna Pigeon. In fact, I just started reading Endangered Spicies tonight."
2,Not a page turner!,"This was my first Nevada Barr book, and I probably wouldn't read another one unless I couldn't find anything else in the library. The subject was good, but I didn't identify with the characters--I didn't really care ""who did it."" It was like a 2-hr movie that could have been a 1/2 hr. show. Definitely not a page-turner."
5,Wonderful,"As I've said elsewhere about this author, she has a wonderful gift for writing compelling and believable mysteries.This particular volume in the Anna Pigeon series demonstrates the ability of the author to make you feel you are there: dirty, grimy, hungry, sleepy and scared. There is also an interesting plot!Highly recommended."
5,An excellent read,"I picked up Firestorm, by Nevada Barr, on the recommendation of my niece, and I didn't put it down again until it was finished.This sort of thing used to happen quite frequently, but this is the first time in years that I've found a book to be so instantly and continually absorbing.This isn't only a great mystery, it's a great book.Even neater, she's written more of 'em!"
4,Firestorm,"If you read ""Firestorm"" just for the description of that disastrous event, you won't be disappointed. However, be sure to finish Firestorm - it has more plot twists than a corkscrew. Great book!"
5,Fireside Chat,"Nevada Barr's Firestorm was the first Anna Pigeon novel I read, back when it first came out. Her writing style moves me to purchase each new book as it comes out. This is an exceptional story of murder and sleuthing. I would suggest it to anyone. Also, her other novels are quite exciing. Making a park ranger into a detective is brilliant writing."
5,I anxiously await the next Nevada Barr mystery in paperback.,"I tried one Nevada Barr book and then another and another, just like eating chocolates! I love mysteries set in places I have been and hers are. I have never been in a firestorm, so the vicarious adventure is enough plus the added agony of trying to find the murderer before he finds her! Her stories keep me up all hours because I can't lay them down."
1,BOOK IS WAY BETTER THAN THE MOVIE!,"i know what people say when the book is better than the movie. this is the case with this movie. i loved the book, and greg louganis story is a very powerful story, and very touching,but the movie is like a damp, wet rag. the acting is horrible, beyond bad. everyone acts to stiff or overacts. if only greg could have gotten better actors for his touching life"
5,Wow - what an amazing film -,I'm going with all the other - 5 star reviewers - OUTSTANDING FILM - Mario Lopez was a Pleasure to Watch and all the supporting actors did a fantastic job as well. This is a Great Film and the talent of all those who worked on this film were clearly evident! WowGreg Louganis should inspire us all!
5,Singing and Dancing and Learning New Skills,"Playful. Delightful collection of stories, songs, kind characters. Shows friends being supportive and positive as younger characters learn new skills. Presented in segments with breaks in between that allow the kids to dance and sing. Ages 2-5."
4,For Randy fans only,"I enjoyed this DVD but if you don't like Jimmy Hendrix style guitar you will get bored. Randy California died while saving his son from a ripe tide in Hawaii. I met Randy a few times during performances with his band, Candy Apple, in 1977 I like the song Randy wrote for his disabled friend Peter Franklin on the 3 CD set. Ed cassidy is always great"
1,the jazz officer almost nails it,Please read the Jazz Officer's review of this video but ignore the parts alleging that a good drummer is present. All three musicians are mediocre and the performance is uninspired. It's hard to believe that two of these bozos were present for the ultra-primo 12 Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus. This film really is awful.....
3,Gangrestresses,"OMG! OR maybe I shouldnt say that. I agree with another member Tony Lewis ..if it would have been about hoes then yeah...it was great...I think it started off in the right direction but somewhere along the way the camera man kinda got sidetracked and it turned into straight porn. How to make a porn movie and ""Champagne"" and all her glasses...whatever..became the focus. It was hilarious. It became a documentary about the life a a shake dancer. The only true down Gangstress up in there was Shaka Don. Why didnt he just feature her and the taxi cab trick. They were gangstresses. By going after them he could have hooked himself up with a lot other true Gangstresses. Next time just do Shaka Don Gangstresses at Large!"
3,"Fairly interesting, BUT....","...this film should have actually been called ""Hoes"", because that's what most of the women in this film can be perceived to be. There was only one girl in this film whom I'd actually label a ""Gangstress"" (the blonde with the gun and the fur coat). Maybe if this were called ""Hoes"", I might be able to rate it higher.If the price is right for you, it might be worth a look. I got mine for free, so the price was definitely right."
5,A must-have,"Plain and simple, it works. And unlike Dr. Scholl's, it doesn't cake up and cause random, unsightly flaking of hardened skin. The applicator also has a brush on the end instead of a bare plastic stem. Dr. Scholl's may work a day or two faster, but Mosco works *better*. It sloughs the skin instead of shocking it off. To piggyback what another reviewer said, it won't turn your toes different colors.I recommend this be used in conjunction with a good foot scrub (or plain baking soda and bar soap) along with a moisturizer like Corn Husker's or Kerasal for long-lasting results. Corns and callouses will always come back if you don't take care of your feet."
3,it's OK,it did remove my corn but the liquid dries up even more the more i use it. i still have some more corns to remove so i guess i'll have to buy more. it does turn the affected area white but new skin grew back quick so that was good. also right after i bought i saw this at my local walmart so i could have just bought it there instead of waiting for it to arrive. the shipping was quick though.
2,corn remover,"If your skin tone is tan get prepared for this product to turn your corn white!! I'm five days into the product and not sure if it's working. The skin color makes it look worse than it was before, I had to hide it with band aids."
3,Strained stretch of a short story into a novel.,"The cover proclaims this book to be funny-sad. I found it to be neither. The elderly woman portrayed here is an irksome, quirky character who is rarely in touch with her feelings and is very cold to the folks who love her. The author uses old age and romanticized memories to justify Ruth's antics. Her meanness makes it difficult to like her. The ""stream-of-consciousness"" presentation is interesting - although sometimes confusing. Would not recommend this book"
1,Couldn't finish,"I tried to read this book on three seperate occasion, several months apart. I have finally given up. I made it to page eighty or so this time and threw the book across the room in agitaion after nearly an entire page of rambling about the way the main character seperated her trash. Nothing engaged me in the story and I did not like any of the characters. My apologies to the author for the harshness of this review, but I can't change the way I feel."
5,"A beutiful piece of fiction, a ""remarkable debut""--NY Times","Truly amazing insights are revealed in this stunning first novel.A funny-sad-quirky novel that lets all of us experience what it islike to be older, as well as giving us a meaningful glimpse intothe soul of someone that we might not ordinarily take the time to study."
1,"Like most bloated swollen things, not good","In my opinion (and that's all I claim it to be, so put the baseball bats down), this is an okay-albeit-tired-premise for a short story which has horrifically mutated into a novel. The symbolism is neither subtle nor clever. In fact, it's about as graceful as that annoying guy on the bus shouting in your ear"
1,This is REFURBISHED item!,"I emailed Amazon about the condition of the watch because I read the reviews about the quality and said that the chain was different than the picture. Guess what, this is REFURBISHED item! However, the seller shows no effort to indicate this anywhere!Buyers Beware! Here's part of the email I got from Amazon Fullfillment center.""Some items offered on our website by third-party sellers (Amazon Merchants) are labeled ""Fulfilled by Amazon.""

2,"inaccurate gauge, plastic over dial melted!","My experience with this thermometer is that it does not hold up well to long term use. The temperature seemed to be inaccurate after the first several uses, and the covering over the dial is made of plastic and melted when I was raising the temperature of the yogurt mix in the oven!"
1,Just used it twice!,"I thought it was a great thermometer, and after using it twice, the glass on top just broke, without any reason. And then, when it's broke you can't use it anymore because the paper that indicates the temperature is not glued and moved... Lost 10 doll..."
2,No!,"Alright, Whole Lotta History in the first place isn't an amazing song. I have their album, Chemistry, and this song just doesn't stand up to some of the other tracks it has to offer.But then what do they do? They have their resident crappy remixer, Tony Lamezma, come in and speed the vocals up, lay down a dance beat, and call it a remix! Ugh.The saving grace, momentarily, of this single is the live cover of the cheeky Wheatus song, ""Teenage Dirtbag"", but it lacks any real personality and therefore loses it's candy coating very quickly."
3,weird and tragic of Charles Hall,"starting out slow but gets better, enjoying it as, much as i read about the adventures to the arctic,still not on my bucket listMike Horns book is what got me started on this one, excellent book"
5,Hits Of Reba McEntire Vol. 1 - Karaoke CDG Songlist:,Contains 8 Songs With AND Without Lead Demonstration Vocals (16 Tracks Total).1. The Greatest Man I Never Knew2. She Thinks His Name Was John3. Is There Life Out There?4. Little Rock5. Sunday Kind Of Love6. For My Broken Heart7. New Fool At An Old Game8. Whoever's In New England
3,Shadow Man a patchwork novel.,"Shadow Man, a short horror tale about a serial predator stalking a fog shrouded town on the Northern California coast, reads less like an actual novel and more like several stories that have been grafted together to form a much longer narrative. Individual moments are far superior than the sum of its parts. Etchison should stick with what he writes best, short stories."
2,Disappointing,"The reviewer crowsomething pretty much summarized it well- the victim should have died much quicker and lost buckets of blood - it just oozed out. The body parts looked rubbery. Did I miss something but how did her head go flying against the wall? And what's with the maggots and earthworms. Wouldn't the body parts have to decompose for at least a few days and then flies would have to come and lay eggs? The killer was kind of weak and dopey, as well.I watched the video on the internet, i would say definitely don't buy it."
1,Come on Charlie?,Lemme startby admitting I am a total newbi to gore but after reading the story about sheen and the FBI I thought wow this will be a real collectors item and unfortunately bought a copy...not recommended. That FBI tale must have been a publicity stunt. I could tell the whole time it wasn't remotely real or terrifying
5,Gore goldmine!,"This movie is short and sweet with some of the best special effects I've ever seen.The Japanese build a replica of a human body and dismantle it before your eyes. The special effects are so amazing you can actually see each pore in the skin.They obviously spent a lot of time on the effects and thats about all they spent time on. No story, no character development, just a home video made to look like a snuff movie. This is the one movie that actually turned my stomach a little bit. Go buy it now, if you think you can handle it."
1,Pure Crap...,"I would like to start out by saying that i heard that this was a truly horriffying movie. I was expecting babies being raped with knives kind of crap, but instead i got horrid effects, ruined illusions and overacting. True the topic it dealt with i guess is disturbing to people who have been kept in the dark that is current society. All in all i have seen worse things here in Iraq, if there is anything that i can say to desuade you from purchasing this DVD, imagine that i have said it... Weak..."
3,Playing with blood,"The Guinea Pig series are supposedly based on some actual snuff film. Flower of Flesh and Blood is the re-creation of those dastardly deeds.This movie graphically shows a woman being kidnapped and hacked up to pieces. It entails the steps of this tortuousous act in fairly realistic fashion.However, I couldn't help but get the strong feeling of being manipulated. This movie seems more like something some buddies threw together for fun. Not the graphic depiction of a heinous crime. Plus, I probably would have enjoyed this more if I hadn't previously seen Aftermath/Genesis, which is much more gruesome and realistic.Still this is worth a look for you gore freaks..."

5,Sports Illustrated for Kids,This was a gift for my 11 year old grandson. He is thrilled with knowing that he is going to be getting it every month. He already likes it because he is constantly looking at the magazine in the grocery store and bugging me to buy it for him. This way we save money and he will be happy getting something of his own in the mail each month.Sports Illustrated Kids (2-year)
4,Motivational,Great mag to get kids active and interested in fitness and a nice addition for reading material. Good motivational articles from professional athletes to other kids across the country. Got a 2 year subscription as a 5th grade graduation gift for my little brother.
4,Sports Illustrated Kids,This is a very good publication. I gave it as a gift subscription to my grandson. Purchasing through Amazon was easy and they followed through.
4,It keeps the kids reading.,"We got a whole year in 2010 for only $10, and couldn't find the same deal in 2011. We only purchased 6 months, and will renew if price is lowered.Amazon's Magazine System is very efficient."
3,Review of the process of ordering a magazine as a gift.,"When ordering a magazine or other subscription services or an App, I would expect that a ""post card"" of some sort could be offered by the company, so that the recipient and giver could ""reach out to each other"" in hard copy.I was not offered this option when I purchased this subscription of SI for Kids. I'd like to have some sort of card or paper that I can offer at a gift exchange. I guess I'll make one up on my own.Just saying --- Dan V"
2,"Great product, bad service","The magazine is fine, but I changed the address it was supposed to be sent to immediately after ordering and 6 months later it still comes to me instead of the intended recipient. Very frustrating!"
5,Love it!,"I expected my first issue of this magazine about 4 weeks AFTER it actually arrived. I was really impressed with the quality of the magazine. I almost didn't order it because I was afraid it would be too ""young"" for my 11 year old but it's perfect for him. He loves it and for $5 I have a birthday present that keeps on giving!!"
4,Love it but wish there was more,"I subscribe to this for my 10 year old son and he loves it, and is always asking when the next issue is. It would be great if this came twice a month or something."
5,Great,"This is really good for sports-oriented kids. My son has interestes in baseball, basketball, soccer, hiking and many other sports or outdoor activities. This magazine provides good broad coverage without having to worry about ""swimsuit issues"" or the like. This was a smart move on their part."
4,Good for kids,This was for my Grandson. He has really enjoyed reading it over the past year. Requested another year subscription for Christmas.
2,"The few articles are OK, but...","Unfortunately there aren't a lot of articles. It seems that this magazine surpasses the adult version in ads and in the photo spreads of cool new products and such. I understand they need to pay the bills, but how many bills can there be when there is so little content. I'm fairly disappointed."
5,Great for young boys,This is a great magazine for young boys who have any interest in sports. My boys read and re-read it until it is falling apart. We now buy it as a gift for all their friends who are interested in sports and do not already get it.
2,Still waiting for first issue,"Since it was a Christmas present, I am very disappointed in how long it is taking to arrive."
3,problems with changing address,The problem was I made a mistake in the shipping address (it was late and I was tired and I put my own address in instead of the child's I wanted to send the subscription to. It took hours to sort it out (so I thought) and the first issue still arrived at my address. Am in the process of trying to sort it out.
1,Poor service,"I was sent a magazine subscription renewal for my nephew and when I renewed it, the mailing address can up as my billing address! This means the magazine will be sent to me (in another city) even though it will not start for another two months and is a continuation of a current subscription. Hard to believe that within five minutes of ordering, they cannot change this!!!Will never order another magazine subscription."
1,Slow Delivery,2-1/2 months from time of order to first magazine delivery...that is IF it actually arrives on 11/2/10 as stated. My nephew is so unhappy. The subscription was for his birthday in September!
3,Not for Girls,"I ordered this magazine for my middle school classroom. I chose this magazine because many of my students are interested in various sports. I have been disappointed because Sports Illustrated Kids has not featured a woman on the cover the entire year I have had my subscription. The boys are always anticipating the next month's magazine, but the girls do not get very excited about it. Hopefully in the future SI Kids will think about featuring more female athletes."
5,I hope the author is busy writing her next book,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Timing is Everything."" I wasn't ready to give up the characters at the end of the book, so I immediately started to read it again. I am looking forward to the next book by Sabra Brown Steinsiek, and hope she is writing it right now!"
5,A spellbinder of a first novel,"Ms Steinsiek has carefully crafted an exciting and enthralling new work. The characters are not just believable, they are people you get to know like friends. Even the ""minor characters"" come fully fleshed. The author has an eye for detail in her locales, but never overpowers you with them. The story moves you through places and plot twists with the ease of a long established writer. This is a must-read book."
3,Not a soft core porno,This was very entertaining however if you are looking for a beat off flick this is not the one. It shows 10 women that get naked together and do various exercises to improve their orgasms. It shows the way women really feel about sex as opposed to pornography showing the way men feel about sex. Ideal for understanding your women sexually and especially women understanding their own self sexually. WARNING: this video is not for you if you are looking for sexual stimulation.
3,"Its cheap and it works.... sort of, mostly","For just over $150 + shipping, the set up works, mostly. I opened the box and spent a half hour assembling the lights. Brand new only two of the bulbs worked, and after being turned on for just a few minutes a second burnt out. After a few uses the third has still not burnt out. The clamps on the lamps and umbrella do not really tighten down enough to lock the lamp into position. It will hold, but if you touch the lamp, even gently it will move. The clamps are just not strong. It feels like if you tighten down anymore you will break it.But, really, it works fine otherwise. If you are a photographer, even a pro, who spends most of your time in the feild, it is a good set up for product photos, and even an occasional portrait."
3,Good begining kit,I really like my lighting. Photo flood is easier to work with because you know what your getting. But with the actual product one of the dome light fixture wont fit on the stand all the way. It doesnt move but it wont pop down all the way. I think it is a defect. The lights get extremely hot. They take up alot of floor space. But I like useing it for now until I can upgrade.
4,A fascinating read stuffed with facts that distrub deeply.,"Sue Dibb has drawn together a huge number of facts, figures, and organisational contacts in an analysis that will make you think twice next time you pick something up in the supermarket. She has revealed that there are more holes than substance in the laws protecting consumers. I found myself reading at every opportunity."
4,An okay video.,"Well, Despite the not-too-promising title (Ugh! I hate Barney!) and the fact that at all the stories on the disc has at least one nursery rhyme or nursery rhyme parody, the disc does have it's high points as well. Like when Ord drinks up the milk in Kiki's milk bottle, then plays innocent. Or Cassie puckering up her lips due to frustration in ""Bad Share Day"". Pick it up if you're a Dragon Tales hardcore (like me), or if you think you can stomach the nursery rhymes and nursery rhyme parodies. Otherwise, you're better off with ""You Can Do It""."
5,Superb,Touching and very well written. One of those books that you wish would never end. An amazing account of a young woman's coming of age in a turbulent place in a turbulent time.
4,good,"It's ideal for someone who needs to be fed. For those who self-feed, the cut is a bit low, limiting the amount of fluid that can be drunk in each glassful."
5,Superb!,"The photos do not do this watch justice. The Raymond Weil Parsifal is an elegant timepiece, almost as thin as a quarter, but not too flashy to wear for everyday. The gold and diamond bezel make a perfect frame for the mother-of-pearl face. My favorite feature is the blue sapphire cabochone on the stem! I love my Weil and I get so many compliments on my georgeous watch. Oh, and it keeps great time!"
3,It is good stuff,just more expensive than buying locally... but I is also hard to find locallyEasy to use and lasts a long time... so it is OK
5,True bacon flavor .,"If you want real bacon flavor , this is the product for you .Many uses and the bacon flavor holds up well when used in hot dishes .Don't be fooled by the discription for 'real bacon flavor ' . If it's not real bacon , it doesn't taste like real bacon .Also , this is the only source I have been able to find for a larger bag and at a very good price .Hormel Real Crumbled Bacon (20oz Bag)"
4,Excellent quality at a reasonable price.,"Honestly, photographers go crazy over lens specifications. But honestly it just comes down to ability as most modern lenses can do a decent job, if used correctly. This lens, while not high-speed by any means, will suit most peoples needs. It is very sharp at middle apertures f8-11, and on a digital camera provides a nice zoom range. A great bargain at the price."
3,nothing new,these are simply three episodes of dragon tales that can just as easily be viewed on pbs. my 3 year old enjoyed them but tired of the same three episodes after a short time.
2,Poor quality control,"Bought Florian Maxi pole pruner system at the Big E 2010 waited for delivery several weeks when I called got the run around, so I drove to factory and picked it up myself problems with rachet from day one year later brought it back to the big E where the gentleman fixed my rachet problem and installed new rope upon trying to prune branches the rope would jump off the roller and hang up leaving the pruner hanging 12 feet in the air.I fixed the problem myself with a 19 cent fender washer being the pulley was too narrow allowing the rope to wedge itself between the pulley and the pole. If someone in quality control was awake they would have seen the problem and installed a wider pulley.The biggest problem is the lack of concern they have for the customer!!"
1,Loser Lopper,An awkward device. No clear instructions. Tried a fairly high branch(the intended goal) then was unable to re-telescope the two sections of pole. No online help. No online instructions. Poorly engineered.
1,????????,Tried to order one of these after the first of the year (2011). Never got it.??? Finally got a refund- just now (April 2011). Soooo- I don't know how the distributor (Illinois Supply) can say they have 19 in stock when I couldn't get them to send me one????
4,This Book is Da Bomb!,"My family discontinued eating meat, or anything non Organic a few months ago. The big problem was figuring out how to keep my hubby fed with good tasting dishes that would not have him missing his meat. We visited my son and DIL in Texas, and she borrowed this cook book for while we were there. I sat with it one night and fell in love. Just had to have it. Ordered it from Amazon the day we got back, and I use it ALL the time. What I love is that it SHOWS you how the various steps should look, as I am not a whiz in the kitchen, that helps immensely! You will not regret this purchase. PS by the way, hubby wants NOTHING to do with meat in his food any more! Our meals are actually much more interesting now than the old meat and potatoes days!"
2,not the best cookbook for vegans,"while this book is more or less acceptable for most vegetarians, too many recipes contain eggs and dairy to be appropriate for vegans. a few contain anchovy paste or oyster sauce, neither of which i consider to be very vegetarian, but as this book has kind of a dated feel to it, that could explain the sketchy ingrediants. even ovo-lacto vegetarians may be uncomfortable with recipies that use eggs as heavily as these do. the nut roast for holidays is a huge headache, the vegetarian gravy an even bigger one. beyond that, this cookbook has not been used in my house a whole lot."
4,good book,"have to say that since the edition wasn't listed for the book, i thought this was an edward gorey illustrated edition. otherwise, the book is in great shape and a great read."
3,The Chessmen of Doom,"It was passible. I was let down. It's just more of the same. The Mummy, the Will and the Crypt were better and spookier"
2,Disappointing .........,"This is the second John Bellairs story I've purchased and read to my 8 and 10 year old kids and they disliked it even more than I did. In their words: ""boring!"". The characters aren't developed all that well, the story is uneven and the ending is anticlimatic. Rather than ""being on the edge of our seats"" we kept waiting for something of real interest to develop and once finished, we were more than happy to put this one behind us and move on to the latest Harry Potter book. Forgive me all you John Bellairs fans, but after reading two of his supposedly best books (this one and The House With The Clock In Its Walls) I think we'll try some other recommended authors."
5,HP Sauce--Why So Rare?,It has become so hard to find HP Sauce where I live in California in the last few years. I have no idea why. It is scrumptious and I'm thinking of opening my own HP-Only Franchise Outlet! (;
5,Outstanding Sauce,"We were introduced to this sauce in Scotland and fell in love with it. This purchase makes it possible for us to enjoy a little taste of our trip. If anyone hasn't tried this wonderful taste, you should. Goes great on hamburgers!JSMIllinois"
1,John Varvatos,Not as advertised. Amazon shows a picture of a gift set but I only recieved a aftershave that was a tester.Not satisfied at all. The good thing is I only paid $8.
5,I Wait a Year for a Book Like This,"The reviewer for Amazon comments that this is a Show-Biz novel, half-way dismising it as such. Nothing could be further from the truth. It's about America, not Show-Biz. There is so much in this story. So much. It works on the personal level, the family, national, and cultural level--you've got some details from other reviews, so I don't need to repeat it. I'll just say that this story is beautiful and devastating all at once. It's the first really good book I've read in more than a year of looking. I thank Mr. Ridley for telling this story."
4,Mann Up,Ridley comes out of a different box everytime. This mock showbiz biography -- Yes I Can meets Dick Gregory is pretty irresistible and finally moving. One downside is that Jackie's routines aren't all that funny.
1,bigoted lines ruin story,"For a book with a theme about race, and the struggle against bigots, the author comes off a s a hippocrite. Italians are his target. H edescribes them as ""Greasy"" or ""dumb wops."" In one chaprter he asks an Italian gangster to talk to a person as a favor. The person gets thrown out window, and book's main charactor thinks of them as ""Dumb Guidos."" Everytime I would get into the story, an Italian put-down would come up. It ruined what may have been a good story, and showed author to be a hippocrite on race."
1,author contradicts self,"Ridley wants to tell a tale with a moral against bigotry. He does ok job, but messes it up with an obvious bias against Italians. Throughout book, everytime an Italian charactor comes up, they are ""greasy"" or ""dumb goombas"" and so on. Why white a story against racism and come off like a bigot? This went on through whole book, ruined what was otherwise a decent story"
1,No cage size given for this stand!,"I'm actually sending this stand back because it will not fit my cage. No information was given saying which cages will fit this stand. I naiively thought this was a universal stand for PH Revue cages. Wrong. Upon opening the amazon box, in huge letters on the box, it says ""for 18"" x 18"" cages only""! That is important information to have before ordering. So I'm letting you know before you order this stand. I am impressed though with Amazon's return process - very simple, a couple of clicks and UPS will be here in a couple of hours to pick it back up! I only got it yesterday. Just sad that money was wasted with this whole process in the first place. So . . . . this stand is only for 18"" x 18"" Prevue bird cages!!!!"
2,Amazing Journey?,"I don't know what all the fuss is about. I have seen over a dozen cosmology videos and ""The Universe"" is one of the most disappointing. Instead of imaginative computer animation to make your tour through our universe realistic, Tim Tulley uses the cheap ""rotate and zoom in on still photos"" trick which simply does not work. Much of what you see are familiar photos of cosmic objects which the camera rotates and zooms in on resulting in static and slightly grainy close ups. Yawn."
2,Factoid Vignettes - No Scientific Synthesis,"The images are excellent of the sun, but for the planets I have seen better quality videos - for free on the NASA web site... The images of stars, nebulae and galaxies are excellent. My primary problem with this video is that there is no attempt to be scientific by linking the rich facts - for example we may find out that such and such a cloud is carbon rich, but not how that was discovered - why it is important or anything else... instead we jump on to the next factoid. The commentary may be turned off - so that you can just watch and listen to the music. This is the best way to use the DVD."
5,A 'Must See' Video for All Ages,"I was very excited to get this and it lived up to my expectations. The pictures of the universe are simply spectacular. The camera even photographed the inside of black holes! To see the planets as they really are is thrilling. To see the amazing variety of phenomena in space is an extraordinary experience. This video is a must for students of all ages. My 90 year old mother is reviewing her religious beliefs after watching this, and asking some profound questions. I will have to watch this several times to get it all. It made me want to study astronomy."
5,The Universe,"Beautifully done, excellent narration. Should be in every public library and in every school library."
3,Received the Wrong Pendant!!,"I placed my order on May 1st, for delivery before Mother's Day (May 14th). I received a package on May 3rd - it was a beautiful package, with the jewelry box wrapped in tissue and placed in a larger box - but it was the wrong pendant! I called American Pearl and they said to send back the necklace and upon receipt they would immediately ship out the correct piece. I sent it back and according to FedEx tracking, it was delivered to their offices on Friday, May 5th. I called on Tuesday, May 9th because I hadn't yet received the necklace - only to be told that they would be shipping it out on Wednesday, May 10th - for delivery on Friday, May 12th! I sincerely hope that it arrives in time, or else they will be hearing from me again!"
5,Great book.,Informative book for all ages. My children enjoy it every Spring and we always send it to school as they hatch their butterflies.
5,I share it with all of my classes!,"This book is perfect for 3rd grade and under. I normally use it as a read-aloud, although this would be just fine for them on their own. Great book!"
3,Good book for elementary age,"I used this book in a kindergarten class when teaching the life cycle of a butterfly. The pictures are great and very clear. The wording however is a bit much for kindergarteners. I would suggest using the text for second grade and up. Overall, the concept was understood and the children enjoyed looking at the pictures during free time. I would suggest this book for any elementary school teacher."
3,a good supplement,"this book gives children a chance to explore and see the beauty of butterflies. it is one a few that I considered, this one was available at the time I needed it"
4,"""The Force Is Strong With This One...""","Having recently discovered Star Wars Legos, all I can say is this: I'm hooked. I received a Mini Star Destroyer in my Christmas stocking and I haven't stopped since. I got this item for my birthday and recently finished putting it together. It isn't too difficult to put together, so it's appropriately rated for its advertised age range.Honestly, my favorite feature of this set is not the TIE Fighter itself, but the Darth Vader figure that is included: If you push down the head of the figure, the light saber glows a beautiful and vibrant 'Dark Side' Red, I like to call it.Overall it is a fun toy to put together and display. The only detractor for me - the wings are a teeny bit wobbly. The ship still stands up and displays quite nicely. Otherwise, my Star Wars Lego universe will contine to grow."
4,a reveiw,This toy is an ok toy. I had a fun time puting it together. I put it together in about 10min. I would recomend it to anyone who likes star wars. I say that a 8 year old and up could do it.
4,Nice Set,I really like the Tie Fighter in this set. I don't really like the Darth Vader light-up light saber. It's one of the strongest sets I've ever built. This set has a great form and also can be a link to Death Star II or the Imperial Star Destroyer.
4,like it,"well, i think the laptops great. i love the way it looks, feels, sounds. it was hard for me to get used to the screen - being that the screens big but that everything you're reading is small, but everything seems super, except that i've had it for almost a week and when i leave it on for a little while the enter key seems to stop working. i don't get and sony has no explanation. i would think that being only a week old there should be no problems. but once i get this resolved, it will all be good."
5,Awesome educational set!,"This is one very educational set: 6 tapes1. Antarctic: Wildlife Adventure2. Crocodiles: Here Be Dragons3. Amazon: Land of the Flooded Jungle4. Arabia: Sand,Sea and Sky5. Bali: Masterpiece of the gods6. Season of the Cheetah"
3,The Carmicheal and Sutherland saga continues,"Its always nice to read one of Ms Barchlay's stories. Hunter Carmichael saw his aunt kidnapped when he was a child. Now he's a grown man, works for the king, and returns to his childhood home to find justice at last. He finds, instead, that his aunt wasn't kidnapped, but went willingly with Alex Murray. Murray is long dead, replaced as clan chief by his dautgher, Allisun. An unplanned handfasting results. Then Allie loses her memory from an injury inflicted by one of her own clan. She's happy with Hunter until her memory returns. The mysteries include what really happened to Hunter's aunt, who is blackmailing the border clans and will Allie put aside a life time of struggle for happiness with her arch enemy, Hunter. We all know the answer to the last mystery. An interesting, but not breathtaking story. But I'll continue to read the series."
3,Jumps around,"I've read other Historical fiction romances. This one is intriguing, but jumps around a bit and seems a bit fantastical."
5,It was absolutely amazing,"I've read this book four times and I still have trouble putting it down, along with the rest of Barclay's novels. They are entrancing."
3,Good choice for bikers with prescription glasses,I've found them very useful for bikers like me.I must wear my prescription glasses while riding. Fitovers allow me to wear them and to have protection by UV rays. They fit perfectly in my helmet. And when I've got to read something I have only to wear my fitovers off.Fair price.
4,Excellent Read For Anytime of the Year!,"I got this book as a library loan for my Kindle. I have been wanting to read something by Karen Kingsbury and thought I would give this a try. I really enjoyed reading this book. It's a very touching story about belief, reaching out to others, and that God, through others, can help heal a broken heart and broken life. A timely message for everyone no matter the time of year."
3,A fair commentary on Farrakhan,"Three and a half stars. While it would have been nice if this book had one, stand-alone introductory biography of Louis Farrakhan, and then the articles in reaction to his life, the reader can glean quite a few biographical details about Farrakhan, Elijah Muhammad, and the Nation of Islam. The collection of authors commenting on Farrakhan may sometimes praise him for his ability to speak for the oppressed black man, but more often they criticize him for his negativity, anti-Semitism, and lack of a clear positive agenda for the African-American community. Farrakhan message is as ambiguous as his legacy will be, and it is clear that he is only one voice in the African-American community, who cannot speak for all. Readers should find some engaging comments and criticism in this anthology of writings on Louis Farrakhan."
1,Don't be misled...,This book was written by someone who obviously does not have an open mind and may not have even heard Farrakhan actually speak.I was disappointed...
2,Penguin Encyclopedia,Was surprised to find that no information prior to 1975 is included in this book. The font size is readable.
2,Mediocre collection. Awkwardly extracted + spliced.,"With a Ph.D and extensive training in the areas detailed by this book, I should have enjoyed the read more. But the editor's choice of chapters did not lend to a good read. The excerpts chosen fail to cohere. And the excerpts here are not good representations of the authors' work.The table of contents made my mouth water: Bourdieu, Strathern, Foucault, Dumont, Luhmann, Habermas, Lyotard, etc. But the sum is far, far less than the sum of parts.The introduction isn't a great deal of help--one feels that this collection is more representative of Faubion's personal faves, and less a work designed to communicate to a greater audience.There are much better collections addressing the re-thought subject. This is not the one to choose. I'm afraid I just cannot recommend this collection to anyone."
5,Another viewpoint of history,This book is an amazing part of history. Few people would have guessed that the famed and loved childrens story teller Dr. Seuss would have been a major force for WWII political cartoons. The books is sectioned by times and people and there is a description (both historical and chronological) for every cartoon. The images are moving and the book is a must for any collector of Seuss or lover of history.
4,How the Nazis Stole the World (Almost!),"Collectors of Dr. Seuss books will definitely want this volume. I found it eerie to see creatures which later appeared in books like ~Horton Hears a Who~, ~How the Grinch Stole Christmas~, and other favorite books of my childhood turning up in caricatures of Axis powers, racists, war profiteers, and the Fifth Column. But, upon reflection, I must admit that these cartoons mark the origins of the themes of community awareness and social consciousness that distinguish his comedic later works. I would not call this a book to be had on every shelf, but if you grew up with Dr. Seuss and still sneak peeks at those slender volumes up in your attic (or in the clutches of your own children and grandchildren), you will find yourself fascinated by the obvious comparisons.The book includes explanatory commentary by Richard H. Minear and a chronology of the cartoons."
5,Great For Teachers!,"I teach World History in high school and I love this book. I would agree with a previous reviewer that for the person who is just picking this book up to read, the book would be improved by being presented chronologically. However, I found this book to be invaluable when presenting the propaganda of World War II to students. They have a natural love of Dr. Seuss and are very interested in the cartoons. Their interest in the cartoons leads to a lively discussion of the content of the cartoons. A must for all teachers of World History, U.S. History or any history of the modern era."
4,"Even before the Cat, Dr. Seuss was in a league of his own.","An amazing (and at times amusing) look at the ""Greatest War"" in the history of mankind, as well as a sub-conciously-psycho-analytical autobiography of one of the great literary minds of the 20th Century. In this book, Seuss blares (at full blast) the political edge that he oh-so subtly reveals in his childrens books later in his life.I only give it less than 5 stars due to the good Doctor's unfortunately harsh (and somewhat hypocritical) caricature of the ""Japs"" during the war years. It leaves me to wonder if later in life (say about the time he penned ""The Lorax""), he realized the ignorance/denial of his own xenophobia.Despite this lapse of good taste, every fan of Theo Lesieg should have a copy of this on his/her coffee table; I would actually recommend it as a suplimentary textbook in any high school/college level course in contemporary US History."
4,Dr. Suess Goes to War,"I have not purchased this book yet but my 11 year old son and I look at it in the store. These cartoons are fascinating, but I was especially intrigued by a group of them depicting the major newspapers and groups creating division among people of the United States. This is obviously going on now with the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, but I never knew that the media back then was pulling the same thing! Very interesting book."
5,feedback,I recieved my book quickly and in excellent condition. I'm very pleased with this service. I will continue to order from amazon.
2,Not impressive,I wasnt impressed by the recipes in this book. There was nothing new or interesting in the whole book. Just some simple and already known recipes.
1,Simply Awful,"I am a good cook. I am at the level that I can make a lot of good recipes, from scratch, off the top of my head. The recipes in this book simply don't work. The Porcupine Peppers recipe forgets to mention that the meat needs to be browned before mixing - so you will either ending up cooking the peppers for 1 hour and 15 minutes or, if you follow the recipe, die of food poisoning. The meaty lasagne doesn't have enough liquid in it to cook the noodles (I had to add about 1 cup of water). The Garlic Chicken and Tri-Colored Pasta didn't cook the pasta right, some was hard and crunchy and the rest was gummy. I have a stomachache from trying to eat the mess, and am very upset to be throwing away 2 chicken breasts, a box of pasta and 2 heads of broccoli because it didn't come out. This book is so bad that I am going to recycle it, I do not want to risk giving it away and having someone else get sick from the food. Yuck."
4,Excellent wool cover,"I use this cover over flat cloth diapers without any pins, and they hold everything in place well. This is our ""nighttime cover"" and I know I need to lanolize when the cover starts to feel damp in the mornings. However, there have been no leaks whatsoever, and the few poops we have had in it have been well contained due to the leg gussets. My baby is more of a pear-shape with a slimmer waist but chubby thighs, and she is barely at the lower end of the weight limit for these covers and they are already tight around her thighs- on the looser snap, hence the 4 stars. I don't know how much longer she will be able to wear it, but I would still buy the larger size simply because these are quality covers and worth the money. If you do machine wash, you may need to lanolize every time though."
1,Product not as Described,The product was not as it is described. The description is for a Kwik 3 arrow Quiver. The item sent was the carbon arrow holder part only. The description did not say anything about this being only a part. The invoice stated the item as shipped however the description did not. I emailed the seller several times and did not receive a response in any way. I will not buy from this seller again.
3,"It's OK, but...","I have read this book and the Changeling Prince. I like this story line, but it is extremely frustrating to read. She never quite finishes her stories. It is almost like she gets to a certain point and decides that the story is long enough, so she suddenly ends the story. Like the ending to this one. One minute they are hating each other, the next they are traveling off down to who knows where like they are friends. The Changeling prince is the same way. It is one of those type of books that you can't put down, yet really agravates you because of the way things are left undone. I would read another in this series to find out if she is going to end it, but none of her other books, because it is too frustrating."
3,Not as good as the rest of VVV's stuff,"I really think this book is not up there with some of her better stuff like Dragon't Bait and Companions of the Night. I felt inclined to smack Lylene half the time. The prequel ""Changeling Prince was a lot better."
4,Good product,My husband was able to put this together in a couple of hours without too much trouble. It looks very nice in our baby's room. I would purchase again.
3,It's okay...,"Just make sure you don't pay too much for it. He spends a lot of time breaking down a very simplistic system and he repeatedly remarks about how easy trading is. A little misleading to say the least. There are a few good points you can glean from the DVD, just don't expect too much and don't pay more than $10-$15 for it.As for the good points, he has an interesting take on using the 20 and 40 simple moving averages on weekly charts. Some of the info in this area is useful.http://www.thelawyertrader.netSome of the bad points are his interpretation of candlestick patterns...such as looking to sell or short a stock after 4-6 green/up bars. In fairness though, this may be a sign of the times. This dvd was made in the middle of a bull market so maybe putting some of his techniques in the right context (bull market) is helpful."
4,We Wanna Boogie,"Rockin' wild man with red-dyed hair and wild stage performances he is one of the wildest rockers to record for the legendary Sun label. It's rumoured that Elvis recorded ""So Glad You're Mine"" and ""One Night"" after he heard Sonny's versions."
4,A favorite,"One of my favorite albums. With a heavy pop feel Womack delivers soul stirring gospel. Its almost enough to make me go to church, but that music isn't nearly as good."
4,A Solid Effort!,"This is one of my favorite albums. Both instrumentally and lyrically, this Argentinian remains in top form. Though not the best example of Fito's work (if you haven't heard him and can only buy 1 album), ""Circo Beat"" does contain a few classics and there are no ""bad"" songs on here. This is a must have for any Paez fan and highly recommended to fans of Spanish rock."
4,"exceptionnal, sold the debt with the sixties...","Born in the end of the sixties, Fito Paez seems have had all the best enter in his child's ears... In this disc, he returns us the whole staff with marvelous brio."
3,Puede y DEBE rendir mas.,"Fito, fito, fito...creo que sos un GRAN artista, pero sacar discos a lo loco sin depurar el meterial es degastar tu propia imagen... Lo dicho en el título, podés sacar cosas mucho mejores que este disco -que tiene momentos buenos-que en el balance gral. se queda corto..."
5,intellectual,"This is a very good sci-fiction book. It's not anything like Star Wars, but it's just as exciting. If you're the type of person who likes intellectual kind of books with not too much wham-bamm-kaboom action, this is the book for you. It's also about the diabolical human nature, in the terms of loyalty, greed for power over others, and what desperate people do in desperate situations. This guy can really cover every little detail in this story, sometimes it's unbelievable! A really great book by a great writer and not to be missed!"
1,Prisoners of Hope,"I bought this book after seeing the pictures of Afganistan, thinking it would be interesting to read. I found it skipped around alot, didnt go into details about much. I have lost interest in it and dont know if I will even finish reading it."
2,Dumb and dumber.,"This story would make a hilarious movie starring Adam Sandler and Will Farrell as two muddle-headed evangelists who bumble their way through a foreign country, obliviously offending and endangering everyone they come into contact with. Of course, the funniest part of the story (in the ""Being There"" tradition of elevating simpletons to great heights) is when the hapless duo return to the US to be treated as heroic royalty by incredibly gullible segments of the population who mistake their primitive naivete to be a sign of courage or nobility.If you love reading books about totally clueless Americans who embarrass themselves and their country in ill-concieved attempts at religious conversion, you're gonna love `Prisoners of Hope'. Soon to play at a theatre near you under the title of ""Dumb and Dumber Go to Afghanistan"".2 stars for unintended humor and absurdity."
5,Loved it!,"I do a lot of reading, and was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. It is very well written and does a good job of showing the reader what daily life was like for those living in Afghanistan. I appreciated the honesty, and the portrait of faith displayed by these courageous, Godly ladies!"
5,What a book!,"I can't say enough about these two women--They are a tremendous examples of people who are willing to stand up for what they believe. And I found it beautiful the way they talked about the people in Afghanistand and how much they grew to love them. When people worry about the convictions of the younger generations I think they should just be reminded of what Ms. Curry and Ms. Mercer put on the line, giving of themselves, trying to spread God's love by serving the poor and (yes) at times sharing about the faith that motivated to go to Afghanistan in the first place."
1,Obnoxious little twits...,Here's the story of two zealots who went into Afghanistan to spread their loopy theories. Their writing is insipid and self-righteous and I have no more sympathy for them than I do for John Walker Lindh.
2,"I should of give it 1 star , but ...","But I gave it 2 stars . Why ? Because I think that books , written by sereal killers or rapists are worse than this one .Now they making quick bucks on thear own stupidity and criminal behavier , for which they was arrested in Afghanistan . They knew , that they going to break the law ( advertising Christianity is illigal in Afghanistan ) and lied to get in . I call it premeditated criminal . It also shows me level of thear intelligence - no respect to other country culture and laws . By thear actions they put other people in danger and , from my point of view , did opposite job .This book is so boring and badly written , that for the first time in my life , I couldn't finish it and gave up in the middle of it ."
3,Dinghies!,"These are sweet, nice girls. But, wow, what a couple of dingbats. They put a lot of people's lives at risk, though, so I would like to say they are harmless, but they are not really harmless. You can tell by looking at their pictures on the cover that nothing will stop their missionary works and they totally don't care about the lives of the people they endangered. I honestly don't think they are bright enough to realize that their actions actually endanger a lot of people and their actions may be doing more harm than good on a global level. Nothing will stop these girls, that much is clear. They say at the end that they are planning a missionary trip to the Sudan by way of Lybia. Good grief!! The book is not well written, a little rambly at times. These girls, I don't know, something is missing upstairs if you catch my drift. Also, I was sorely disappointed. I was hoping for some really steamy stuff about women in prison. Sadly, I guess Afghani womens' prisons aren't like American ones."
1,dumb dumb dumb,"Stop me if you've heard this one:So these girls go into Afghanistan, then one of the most repressive theocracies in the world. They are -- get this -- missionaries, and they wander around trying to convert the ""heathens"" to Christianity, which is a little like opening a synagogue in 1930s Germany. It would make a good sitcom, in the tasteless manner of ""Hogan's Heroes,"" but it makes a lousy book. Religious zealotry is the worst thing on the planet and these two crullers merely wanted to exchange one type of fanaticism for another."
1,God will Punish These Girls,"These are the kind of people that should lock themselves in their bedroom closets and never come out. They (and others like them) are naive to believe that they know how to help the world. In their spiritual and cultural ignorance, they do more harm than good. They have brought darkness to the world."
1,All Hoax,"The two women were never prisoned by the talliban, that is true. But they were not aid workers like they told you. It is a propaganda from the U.S. They were spies for President Bush to oversee the the destruction of the talliban. But when they were captured, the President want them out and sent soldiers to do his job just for the cause of worthless freedom in America."
2,good story but..........,"but I had a very hard time getting into this one. it just wasnt written in the manner of a story that I am drawn to.I like something that flows, but this one, for me, kept gettin gtripped up in its efforts to share their love for God. I dont knock them for loving Jesus and God(Im catholic myself) I just think that it got in the way of them telling their story. I loved the story when I read the description but after I started it,I found myself feeling as if I were being cornered by over zealous people on the topic of religion. I am very catholic and its very important to me, and while I feel that the girls were just being enthusiastic, I think they went a bit overboard. I guess it just got a little bit unobjective (their manner of presentation)and overzealous, to be appealing."
4,I like it,this book is the best book i had ever read in my life time. this book is about two girls that did not have a strong faith about Jesus christ. when i started reading this book every thing in my life had change about me and jesus. my mother help me know how much Jesus means to me and how he make me happy and tells me that every thing is going to be ok. i allways read the bible more because i under stand what is going on in my life. i know that God is going to be with me no matter what.
1,Selfish Narcissistic Fanatics,These two couldnt find ANY OTHER PEOPLE in any country that they could preach to? Perhaps a country where there are poor people that are not at war? perhaps an area where their presence and their lies would not put our soldiers in danger? Or jeopardize the work that real aid workers are doing?Heres an idea...there are plenty of poverty stricken people in need right here in the US...try one of the neighborhoods in any of the cities across our country. Or is that not big enough for you guys? Is it not a big enough test of of your faith?You can keep putting yourselves in harms way to prove your faith in God...but please dont do it at the expense of our soldiers and aid workers.
3,Women who would be kings and their soap opera lives.,"I read this book for a history class I was taking. My assignment was to write a book review. My paper was 5 pages. So I will try to keep it short. This book is easy to read for enjoyment, it only took me a few days to finish. However, if you are reading it for research purposes, forget it. You truly need to be familiar with the genealogy of the royals in the 16th century to follow the author. I found myself trying to sketch out family trees for all the characters involved so I could keep up with which Henry was related to which Mary. Don't be turned off, it is enjoyable and interesting to read about the real lives of these women and their true ambitions."
1,I Feel Ill,"Worst....song....ever. If you can't write lyrics other than chanting the gimmicky title of the song over and over again, stay out of the business."
5,One of the Best Jazz Vocalist Recordings of All Time,"Teri Thornton came back into the spotlight with this album. After brief fame on the rise in the 1960s, her career hit a downward spiral. For a number of years she retired from singing, but won the vocalist section of the prestigious Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition in 1998 (an honour usually given to young performers). After that came a recording contract and this cd. This is a must-have for anyone who loves Jazz Vocalists. Her vocals, slightly husky and smooth. The songs run the gamut from emotional, frisky and sometimes haunting. Everyone I turn onto Teri feels like they've discovered a new artist! One of my Top 3 favorite Jazz Vocalist CDs of all-time."
3,Better when I was younger - But still a joy to read,"Big Phil's Kid, for me, brought back some very good memories. I read and re-read this book several times in my ""tween years"" and laughed out loud. When I saw it on Amazon I had to buy it, if for nothing else but a chance to retrieve some of those simple laughs. It was all I remembered as far as vivid imagery in his descriptions of his relatives, but I also realized that going back to that time is tough when you are 30 years older. A great teen(boy), coming of age novel, and in parts really funny. Enjoy."
5,Works Perfectly!,We have a son with special needs who uses a cup similar to this at school. This is a great product at a fair price. It enables him to be able to drink by himself.
4,Nice light read,This is a very easy and informative read on lightweight backpacking. The author does not go into a great deal of details but explains what light weight backpacking is and how to lighten your load. You can get all the information off the web but it is nice to read it in a good fun compact book.
3,Lighten Up = not for experienced backpackers,"The book content is mostly for beginner day hikers and beginner backpackers.If you are beyond beginner level in either sport, this book is mostly not for you."
5,Handy Little Book!,"I am re-entering the world of backpacking after a long lapse, and am looking for ways to figure out all the new kinds of gear out there on the marketplace, and at my age, lighten my load. This book is a great little tool for doing just that. A short and quick read, it offers very practical tips for selecting types of equipment without recommending specific products, and for packing and living on the trail. An essential guide for any potential backpacker!"
2,A rather lightweight book ...,"With a nod to the author's experience, I'd say the book is light on content.The author could have provided more (and more useful) info than that which can be garnered web-surfing and hitting sites like www.backpacking.net or www.backpackinglight.com."
3,More like an inflated magazine article than book.,"It's good as far as it goes, which is really maybe twenty pages of material. It doesn't go into so much depth that I become struck by some unknown insight; it is a collection of good tips and demonstrable multi-tasking that can save weight and show off a little of your backcountry skills, i.e. build rather than buy, and make on site rather than haul in and out. All of these tips are things you already know, codified for about one hour of reading.Worth it? Dunno. If you're an experienced hiker, you could intuit almost all of this. Any reputable 1st Class or above Boy Scout could do the same at age 14. I'm not impressed with it, and know I'll never re-read it. However, it does serve a purpose to the less-experienced, so in that regard, the content was solid and well-presented.-Fred"
4,A quick read with useful information for beginner or hiker with some experience,"This is a quick, breezy read with plenty of useful (and fun) diagrams. It is comprehensive: from soup to nuts, or perhaps better put, from shelter to hygiene.There's probably nothing in this book that you can't find online, but as a general guide to lightweight backpacking it's good to have it in one place - a 100 page handbook.The information is generic, very few brand names are mentioned. The seven chapters and two appendixes include titles such as ""Understanding Lightweight Backpacking"", ""The Big Three"" (backpacks, shelters, sleeping systems),""On the Trail"", and ""Back Home Again"" - this last on how to clean and store your gear.A good general guide if you're a beginner, and also offering some useful ideas to experienced hikers."
5,Really uplifted me!,"I really enjoyed each little devotional. This is a real Christian woman, with real problems, just like the rest of us. She uses humor, but there is also a very important lesson to be learned from each one. It is nice, because you can pick it up and read one devotion while waiting for an appointment, etc., since they are each about 3 pages long. I found myself laughing and being touched at the same time by the Holy Spirit. Great book!"
5,Unconventional Women Unite!,Thank God for Rachel St. John-Gilbert! This devotional couldn't be more down to earth. It's like a favorite pair of shoes. I'm so glad that there is at least one Christian writer who isn't totally pious and trying to guilt trip me. My favorite is Chapter 13... Living Large. Every woman needs a bit of Rachel in her life!
4,Intriguing...,"The intensity of the characters and plot kept me turning the pages of this intriguing book. Heath is well-known for her controversial subjects, and this may be her most compelling one to date. The beginning is enough to draw tears from the reader and make one forget that one-night-stands are a major taboo - especially in this day and age of STD's. But...it IS fiction, after all. : )All in all, a very emotional, character-driven, yet suspense-filled book, with many heartwarming and heartbreaking moments. The ending was perfection."
5,A Good Read About the Fox Sisters,"I found THE SWEET BY AND BY to be an outstanding book, a fascinating account of the Fox sisters and the early days of American Spiritualism, as seen through the eyes of a contemporary journalist. Well written and fast paced, Makin is an excellent writer. I enjoyed this book greatly and recommend it highly."
5,Masterly and fervent.,"Mackin's narrator, while asserting that she is no ""hagiographer of spurious mystics,"" is an engaging woman, solid in her station, widely conversant with the deeper reaches of the paranormal, and magically involved with her quest. Here she leads the mind in a chase as she finds herself tempted to believe in the return of departed spirits, in a prose that is as amiable to read as the palm of a hand. A haunting book in every way."
4,Engrossing book whose characters become real,"I liked this book a lot. I didn't expect to like it, wasn't even sure what it was about, and didn't realize until I read the cover after finishing it that it was based on a real person. Go figure. I did feel compelled to finish it in two sittings (would have been one, but there simply aren't enough hours in the day or night!), and by the end of the story I realized that I cared about the characters. That says quite a bit. Read this book, enjoy this book, and think about it once you're finished. It will stay with you."
2,GROSS! ...but effective,"Imagine a bunch of grey sawdust mixed with shredded cardboard. Put it in water. Mix it down. That's what it looks like you're drinking when you try this stuff.It smells foul, tastes awful but by far the looks are the worst.You'll feel very full because it's just such a thick concoction, but it will work within a few hours. Unless you get sick first."
3,"good content, bad quality","the yoga practice was good, what i could see of it....the cd was scratched and would not play all the way through."
4,Makes math easy!,"My 11 year old daughter was having difficulty with pre-algebra as it was taught in the text books because they all tend to have so many buzy pages, what with all the colors, graphics and shaded columns. It was making us dizzy! And the explanations were just plain awful.John Hall's simple white board and pen approach,and his slow and deliberate method of teaching helped us tremendously. Everything was straight forward and easy to understand. He definately is the math made for dummies video guru! Only complaint...editing mistakes in the booklets, but ones we were easily able to pick up on and correct."
1,Failure!,"I'm afraid this item hasn't worked as advertise. Couldn't use it with my shaver in West Africa (220v), even at low voltage. The shaver was making so much noise, shaking in my hands therefore unable to use it."
4,What were my parents thinking?,"This show freaked me out as a kid and it's still a bit creepy as an adult. But who can resist the charms of Charles Nelson Riley? Hopefully someday Uncle Croc will come out on DVD.Contrary to what some people have been saying the Krofft show on DVD are not syndicated version. While primetime shows were 25 minutes in the 70s, Krofft shows were made for Saturday mornings. They were shorter in order to pack in more ads and extra educational shorts. How else did School House Rock fit into a show? Check out the times on H-B's Wacky Races to see what a Saturday morning show runs at.The image on Lidsville isn't as good as Pufnstuff since the living hats were shot on video."
4,Lidsville--tv show,The kids that watched this really enjoyed it. It was fun and silly and brought back lots of memories for the older folks.
2,Great Show. Poor DVD,"This is a great show for kids. I grew up with it and have fond memories of it. However, the shows appear not to have been remastered in the slightest. Picture quality is not close to the original. Moreover, it appears that edited versions of the show which were cut for syndication were used on this set -- each show runs about 22 minutes, even though the typical 1/2 hour TV show from the early 70s ran about 25 minutes. It's a shame that such a great show is getting such poor treatment from Rhino."
5,Works for me.,"Flooring Contractor since 1979... so far these hoses are working great (two weeks)... very light & compact. The swivel joint, is a bonus. I would have preferred blue or yellow to the garden hose green. The shipping time was the longest of my orders but, still reasonable. I will be replacing all my rubber and vinyl hoses with these."
2,Sequence of Reading would do much help,"I read Badlwin's book. I have to say that Ford's articles in Dearborn Independent under ' The International Jew' are far well researched and speaking of proven facts more than Baldwin's book.I have an advice for those who would read that book; start with 'Protocols of The Elders of Zion', then 'The International Jew' articles for Henry Ford in 'The Dearborn Independent'and end with Neil's book. Only then, you would be able to level Baldwin's book."
4,Well worth a read,"Neil Baldwin's ""Henry Ford and the Jews"" is a compelling look at how a genius at one thing --- the mass production of a good automobile --- could become such a dangerous buffoon when it came to another thing --- the mass production of an idea. At some point, our title character ceased to be just ""Henry Ford, automaker"" and instead became Henry Ford, wealthy and powerful symbol of international antisemitism. Baldwin's portrait of Ford in all his horrible glory is fascinating."
1,Old news,This is a rehash of a book by exactly the same name published in 1980. The author adds little that has not been published many times before. Writing is academic style. Definitely not recommended reading.
5,henry ford and the jews,"i for years admired ford for his cars, starting the assembly line and turning out reliable vehicles and reasonable prices. this book shows a side of ford that never should have exsisted. his hate of the jews was as bad as hitlers. several of fords books were used by hitler to create hate of the jews. i'm not jewish but can not understand why they were so hated. don't think i'll ever consider buying a ford product"
3,Wide DYNAMIC Range.,The volume of this recording ranges from barely audible to GLARINGLY LOUD. This makes for uncomfortable listnening.
1,a disappointment,"Unsafe sex, trivial stories, a complete throwaway of a book - I'm sorry to see this series go downhill this way."
1,A [bad one] in the series,"Rather dull and disappointing. No real literary stories and no real erotic stories, just a mish-mash of what must pass as ""new""."
1,HORRID!!!!,"This book lacks everything erotica should be. The stories are poorly written, with no viable character development and confusing story lines. No man or woman should be subjected to the horror these people have published.There is one story about a woman who is a phone sex operator and talks with a mentally challenged man. It's rather short and has no flowing plot, and at the end, the man asks the phone sex operator if he should kill himself. Now, I know there are people out there who are into s and m, but come on! How in the world did this story make it into print????Do NOT waste your money on this book. It's downright terrible and has left me with nightmares and a bad taste in my mouth."
1,Bad news,"Bad news for erotica lovers - I enjoyed 1 story in here. Just one! There are so many good erotica books I've read lately, like the Mammoth books, ""Best Bisexual Erotica"", ""From Porn to Poetry"", and so on. I can't imagine why ""Best"" American Erotica has such lousy stories."
3,Good almost great,TD Jakes is as awesome preacher and delivers a poignant story with this novel. While not as gritty as Woman Thou Art Loosed it is still very applicable for those already in the church. While very predictable and stereotypical I recommend this book especially to those who prefer to read more conservative fiction and as a gift for those who know someone like the women in the story but don't know how to tell them they are in need of help. The light and easy story line and good moral content warranted Cover Girls a Bronze rating.
2,Better as a book of short stories,I love the T.D. Jakes ministry and looked forward to his entrée into the fiction arena. I didn't like the book and found the storylines to be too long. Only 1 character was really developed in the book.
2,Better as a book of short stories,I love the T.D. Jakes ministry and looked forward to his entrée into the non-fiction arena. I didn't like the book and found the storylines to be too long. Only 1 character was really developed in the book.
2,Quick! Somebody Turn Off The Lights So I Can Go To Sleep!,"Mr. Jakes is a great motivator! No one can take that away from him. But a fiction novelist he is not! This is one boring book! I just simply could not get into this book. I've tried, for the sake of the author, but I just could not. Now I'm wondering if he really wrote it (with his busy schedule and all). Let's just say that maybe--perhaps--just perhaps, a ghost writer could have written this story. If Jakes, however, did in fact write it, he's probably embarrassed about it. Too late. You can't take it back because it's been published. But the beauty of it is that it can be revised and re-edited in a second printing. I wish I had gotten it from the library instead of buying it. Another thing. The cover was pretty provocative for a Christian fiction, don't you think?"
2,Turn off the lights,"This story was putting me to sleep. Mr. Jakes is a great motivator! No one can take that away from him. But a fiction novelist he is not! This is one boring book!

This book needs to be revised and re-edited with some upbeat to it. I wish I had gotten it from the library instead of buying it. Another thing. The cover was pretty provocative for a Christian fiction, don't you think?"
3,Close...but not quite there.,"I was hesitant to pick this one up from the beginning--and I should have gone with my first thoughts. I absolutely adore fiction written about the Christian experience, however this one didn't quite meet my expectations. I found the subject matter to be great...but at times, there were extended monologues/sermons/preaching that stretched the point. I even felt like I'd heard the sermons before! Good messages, no doubt-but not quite the story development that I seek in my reading. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the characters because we all know women like them...all at different seasons in life. I only wish Bishop Jakes had written more of a story with a moral/lesson instead of a sermon with a story written around it."
3,Shoulda had a V8,"Don't get me wrong. I love T.D. Jakes, and enjoy his ministry.Just not this one. I couldn't get with the characters to save my life. They seemed to have no...oomph! They didn't seem real to me. I gave the book a three because sometimes I felt like it was making sense, but then it would fall right off. The storyline was a yawn, predictable, and I was more annoyed than disappointed. Sometimes the characters would say the same thing three different ways, in the same block of dialogue. I, personally, was bored. Maybe you'll enjoy it though."
3,Power Speaker; but not an Author,"I love TD Jakes the Pastor, Prolific Teacher, the Prophet, a true Man of God. However, in my opinion his writing leaves a lot to be desired. Cover Girls is not the only book that I have read. I really did not enjoy ""The Lady, The Lover, Her Lord"". God's Leading Lady was written fairly well. Pastor Jakes is gifted in many areas, I take nothing from him as I enjoy his ministry tremendously. I just don't think his literature is that great."
3,I Was A Bit Disappointed...,"I'm a huge TD Jakes fan and I love his teaching and preaching ministry. However, I'd have to be honest enough to say that this novel disappointed me. I'd waited a long time to pick this book up and read it, mostly because I had friends who read and it and were lukewarm, at best, with their feedback. After reading it myself, I'd have to agree with them. I really think he should stick to his non-fiction, teaching-style books because fiction isn't his calling. This is such a far cry from the calliber of his teaching tools that I almost have to wonder if he had a ghostwriter for Cover Girls and then just had his name placed on it as the author. This, to me, doesn't even mirror his other printed stuff. At any rate, I did find some of the book to be entertaining (especially the opening chapter) and because I bought an autographed copy, I won't be selling it or giving it away. This book doesn't change my opinion of Bishop Jakes. I still think he's one of the best orators around."
2,"Not Very Good, Original, or Inspiring","Cover Girls by T.D. Jakes (or are the ""ghost writer"" rumors true?) was a book that was not very good, not very interesting, nor was there anything original about it. Okay writing with a predictable plot doesn't really do much for me but that's exactly what you get when you open and read this book. Maybe writing fiction just isn't T.D. Jakes' calling or maybe his next attempt will be better than this. In any case, I don't think I'll be reading anything else that's fiction by him."
4,Keeps getting better,Many of the Non-Fiction books by Jakes are redundant. Cover Girls is phenonmenal when a man writes so well about woman and relationships. The book is great for book clubs.
5,Great Family Cookbook,"Book was delivered promptly. I just love this book. Bought it on a reccomendation by another mom, and I think it's super. It's very simple but is giving me some good new ideas for the whole family. Our kids loved the baked codfish, and a couple of the recipes. There are many recipes on my to try list, but everything we've made so far has been a hit."
3,"Cut well, but not very durable....","The blades cut great, but with the bucking you usually get from a sawsall, they bend really easily! I've already thrown away 3 with very little usage. I don't have much to compare them too, but I sure hope all blades aren't like these!"
4,fish the night,"I loooooove Saariaho, but I couldn't get into this album the first few times I listened to it. The main reason is that I personally loathe the sound of the human voice in constructions such as lieder, or ""songs"", etc. And apparently Saariaho's early compositions were vocal ones. Now, her case is different. Her use of the voice in mostly sonic environments is really sublime, like the vocal techniques used in Maa, her ballet piece. So, I thought, what the hell? This must be good too. Unfortunately, the pieces on this CD are composed for traditional instruments, guitar, flute, harp, etc. and must represent some new trend in S.'s music. However, I gave it another chance and it is slowly growing on me, even the songs in English, which is a terrible language for such things anyhoo, methinks. Now I can say that it was worth purchasing it, as all of S.'s works are."
1,Died after 30 minutes,"Psu died after 30 minutes of use and I had to return it, waste of time for me. I suppose it might be a good product still and that I had 'bad luck', but surely with a product in this price class you should be able to have certain expectations... Replaced it with a 1000W Antec from the local CompUSA for about the same amount of $, that unit has been running flawlessly."
1,Ahah! what a dud,"I have a hasbro jedi starfighter and i'd say that one is much more detailed and strong.Of corse this is lego and its not metal, but hey!The hasbro starfighter crashed several times and did'nt even get a scratch this product the wings would easily fall of.And the vulture droid its just a similar version of another vulter droid that i'd already have,so why have two? I'd recommend not buying this its not worth 20 bucks."
4,"very nice toy, bad service","I had a problem with the delivery. The shipmen was damged, and it was mis-sorted by carrier. I put several messages to toywiz, but no one answered. Amazon didn't help me. I had to phone toywiz, and they told me they had no idea of what was happening, amazon didn't tell them there was a problem with the delivery. Incredible but true.They were very very kind on the phone, and sent me a new article (it arrived 24h later) and I got it for Christmas.Something is not working with your communications, hope next time your delivery works better."
4,"Great Lego, But vulture droid's wings are frail.",I got this Lego as a birthdary present and it was Great! Only the vulture droid's wings can fall off easily. The same thing happens with the Jedi Starfighter. How is a Lego Eduacational? Besides maybe patience all it is is putting stuff together. Still a great toy.
3,NOT worth 20$,"I have Saved Up For This Toy For A long Time And once i bought it, i found out that it is only About 7 or 6 inches big! of course i was a little dissapointed but i guess i can cut som slack and say that it is fun to play with... but still dont waste ur money on a 10$ object and keep saving till You can get The ARC-170, not to mention a MUCH better LEGO set."
5,great,"This toy is great.It's cool,decent price,and awsome look.But don't compare it to a hasbro starfighter,thier totally different.Overall if you need a lego ship for your person this is great."
4,"Good price, good kit","This kit can be found usually for $15-$20 and contains the two ships and an Anakin lego with lightsaber. My son loves the figure as much as the ships! The Vulture droid is much more stable than the Starfighter and works very well. The Starfighter is very cool, but the wings tend to detach during play. Hey...its a Lego...not a plastic toy. Just snap it all back together and fly on! A good kit at a good price."
1,Faulty Design or Poor Quality?,"This Power Adapter appears to be identical to the one that is supplied with theBelkin Wireless G Plus Router. I bought two of these routers from Belkin, and the power adapters that came with them both failed within two years! Power adapters like this don't normally fail, so it is likely that they failed due to a faulty design or poor quality components. However, it is also possible that the above Belkin router design requires more power than this tiny adapter can provide (5 Watts). My power adapters never felt like they were over heated though, so I believe the adapter is simply not reliable. Therefore, if you buy this router, be prepared to buy a better power adapter!"
2,This is a collection of pictures of floral paintings,"This is a collection of pictures of floral paintings...and only pictures. The only text is that in the minimal captions for the pictures (i.e., name of the work, artist, and [sometimes] medium). There is no discussion or instruction. The only ideas and inspirations are those that may be generated in your mind when you view the pictures.However, the pictures cover diverse styles and mediums. If you are looking for a book of pictures, this may be for you. If, however, you are looking for anything more, you may be disappointed."
3,Expo2000 cd-single: There is life at Kling Klang,"The wait is over. The first new studio material from Ralf & Florian since Electric Cafe, and it sounds pretty cool. Based on the clips heard, don't expect music ahead of it's time like we are used to. It's Kraftwerk, though, no doubt. And Florian is totally bald now."
1,Did not work for my active 12 pound Skipperkie girl,"Simply not as break resistant as you might expect. Rosie weighs only 12 pounds and is 12 years old and this only lasted a month before I found cracks in the cable.( yes, she as with all Skips, is very busy) As she fits through our iron fence slats, and Skips are prey seekers, I have to tie her out when she is outside. I need a solid heavy tieout line for her and this one did not hold up even if rated for a MUCH larger dog."
1,piece of crap,I received this cable through the mail today and i almost cried when i saw it. i will not even bother putting on my yellow lab he will break within 5 minutes.This is a cable best used for smaller dogs.920 POUND BREAK STRENGTH ?WHO CAME UP WITH THAT LIE?i coul;d have saved time and money and just bought one from the dollar store for 5 dollars it would work just as good.
3,dont like the clasp,The cable is a beast but I dont like the clasp they are hard to open and almost inpossible with 1 hand. But as far as the cable its better then most I have used before
5,I disagree with the one review,"I disagree with the written review about ""Your wife or mind"". I know the quality of the picture id s bit off but what can you expect for the 70's. I'm not sure I have the entire movie but I soon will. The movie is hot and depicts what a swinging lifestyle might actually be like."
5,Perfect primer on US/ SINO Relations,This is an excellent compilation of US/ SINO relations. Kennedy weaves divergent perspectives to give the reader a well rounded POV into the history and future of the US's relationship with the middle kingdom.
1,DON'T BUY!!!!,"As a 2nd grade teacher, I am appalled at this book. It should not be given to children as a good piece of literature!!! There are many misspelled words and the back of the book should give you the biggest hint where it says ""SUCKAS"". I am also a mother of 2 boys and I will do everything I can to keep this out of their hands!!"
1,Stinks!!!! >:(),This book stinks!!! It looks really dumb and pictures are horrible and it has one crude humor !!!! Don't buy for children under ten!!!!!!!!!
1,ORrLE,How DAR the autho nisspelled on purpose!!!!! It is just a stupid and no brain parody. Hasno jokez. odcih. Do NOt even try the sample. delet t.
1,The worst book possible,This book is hateful!!!!!! It is sooo stupid. This is NOT humorous and it is SO misspelled that couldn't get what 'gards' meant. T took ages'' to figureout tha it meat guards. Not worth the money at allll
1,"Tommy we NEVE use that word, and Suckonbooks, you are rude. This vook it ERRIE!!!!!!","Thisis horrible! Why mispell words wrng on PURPSE!! Why? Super Diaper Baby was only ok. have had E4NoUhg of this!!!! Horrible!!! He mispellings: Welkum, gards( neer noticed that it was GUARDS:{), heros, jerney, theries. Even the WORDS on the , like, menu contente, tableof, were mispelled. Do not buy this horrible crap."
2,"Kids love it, but I feel otherwise......","I bought this book for my second grade son today, at our school's book fair. He read the entire book in an hour! He loves it. I wanted to see what was so fantastic about this book, so I looked through it. Every page is full of 'purposely' misspelled words! Please tell me how this helps a 7 year old, who is actively learning how to spell words correctly? For example....the word 'neither' is misspelled as 'neether'. The word 'ancient' is misspelled as 'anchent"". How does this make any sense to a young brain? Although my son really enjoyed the book, I will not be buying any more."
2,Not for every home,"This book is fun for kids, but contains language that many parents would not use in front of their children and would not want to hear coming from their children's mouths. Deliberate misspellings may be a concern for kids who find spelling a challenge."
5,Good Book,My son is 10 1/2 and loves this book.He loves Captain Underpants. He got as IPad for Christmas and this is a convenient way read books.
4,for my son,my son loves this series so when i see one of these books i get it for him. he has read this one numerous times.
2,"Fun, but words are misspelled. Buyer beware.","My 7 year old loves this book. But as a parent, I just cringe when he picks it up. Words are purposefully misspelled and the grammar is terrible. Examples of misspelled words on the first page: ""evidense, forchenately, theries, importent, exampel. Examples of poor grammar: ""Me shure hope this works!"" and ""Hey, that just dumb enuff to work!"" The poor grammar doesn't bother me as much, they are cavemen after all. But the combination of the two makes me wonder if my son is doing more damage than good when he reads this book.I don't understand the need for bad spelling. It would be funny without it."
1,Cheesy and horrible.,"I am a Captain Underpants fan. I hatedthe Super Diaper. So many deliberate misspellings!!! I think that it horrible. Never buy this book: You wll never understand this crap. really want to burn all copies! :( F you like it you wll never grow smart. ""So there!"""
4,"Ha, ha, ha, ha.","Okay this one is a graphic novel by the characters in Captain underpants series. It is okay, pretty funny, but not as good as the Underpants series."
2,Disappointed Capt Underpants fan,"My sons and I have read all the Captain Underpants books and have loved most of them. Super Diaper Baby wasn't fantastic but still had some funny stuff in it. The mis-spelled words haven't been a problem. However, I regret buying Ook & Gluk. There are a few reasons, but the main one I'm writing about is the name-calling. Like ""you dummies"", ""you dumb kids"", ""you idiot"", ""you are an idiot"", ""hate you guys"", ""you dipwad"", etc. Also, things like ""dang"", ""what the"", ""me keel you"", ""you're the father of my butt"". Anyway, we were all looking forward to this book. But it's just not as good as the CU series."
5,The greatest yet!,"This is definitely the best Olsen film yet. As a fan of over ten years, I expect a lot from Mary-Kate and Ashley and they still continue to surprise me. At first I didn't like Winning London very much. I felt it was too different from their previous productions. But as Mary-Kate and Ashley grow up, so must their movies, and the second time I saw this movie, I realized how great it was. This is the best Olsen movie ever. If you are a fan and haven't seen it yet, you are nuts! Do yourself a favour and see 'Winning London'!!!!!"
5,Winning London: Fame or Shame,"""Winning London"" not only catches the eye, but some girls said that the guys in this film caught their hearts. [Friend's name] says that ""Brian"", the one that ""Rhiely""(played by Ashley Olsen) practicly gave her heart to, captured [her] heart too. I think that the British boy is HOT! He is so hot, that if someone touched him(which I want to do) they'd burn to death. I say that this one gets FAME! Well, my review is done. Like I always say, ""Adios, sianara, buh bye!"""
2,To Much Kissing!,This movie starts out good but then it gets really gross. Belive me I am 11 years old and Winning London is not the best movie the Olsens have ever made! I almost ... at the ending when Brien was saying how fantastic Riley was. I hated the kiss in the air vent and when Chloie and James kissed on the boat SICK!!! Trust me on this one IF YOU LIKE MUSH then get the movie. If you want to get this movie because your a fan then DON'T!!!!
1,I love the olsen twins,"I love the olsen twins but there movies are awful!!! the only good movie is passport to paris and it takes two, the rest our awful. This movie captured the steriotypical London people. First of all not all English people talk like they have there head stuck up their ...!!!!!!! Second of all if anyone actually thought there acting was good you must be seriously deranged, one of the guys acted like a 6 year old kid telling jokes not to mention mary-kate boyfriends role, like how many times has that dissaproving stuck up dad been done!!!!!!When i first looked on amazon i thought this film looked wicked even though many people said it was awful, i just rushed out and brought it...........big mistake, don't get me wrong I LOVE the olsen twins but you gotta tell um like it is............there movies ...!!!!!"
1,"Oh no, please, stereotype Brits! You know you want to...","Oh dear Lord, yet another movie that stereotypes Brits. Yes, we must all be rich and own large expanses of land and oh, yeah, we must ALL live in London. If I were one of those poor guys, I would be severely tempted to mug Mary-Kate and Ashley, which is far more likely. An unoriginal movie, which is really sad. I am quite sure there is someone out there willing to write an original plotline for these two and they might just refrain from ruining it. But really...isn't it funny how American's still think us English are completely up ourselves? We're not! Really! And I, for one, do not own half a county and have an incredibly rich relative. I'm not that offended at being constantly depicted as wealthy, neither are my mates, but, hmm, if you're going to put it in the title, couldn't you at least research the place a bit...?"
1,THIS IS SO STUPID/TERRIBLE!!,"This Movie is so.... stupid. Don't get me wrong; I'm a HUGE fan ,but this movie is just plain dumb. Parents, if you want your kids to have a good example of a movie. Don't get this one. There is like 5 kissing scenes. Got one word for this movie. STUPID!"
5,The Absolute Best!!!!!!!!!!!!,This was the best Mary-Kate & Ashley movie I've seen in my whole life!I liked in so much because it was in London and I've been to London.I also like how the people who picked the actors picked that cute(really hot) guy to be James.I also really liked the music.It rocked!
5,Best M-K&Ash movie!,I think that *Winning London* is the Olsen Twins best movie. They are great actresses and the British guy in the mvie (james) is SOOOOO HOT! I wish I could meet him in person!
5,THE BEST,This movie is awesome.Its the best among all of the Mary-Kate and Ashley movies.Their acting was great in this movie and the british guy is so cute.You should definetely pick up a copy
1,Worst Movie Ever,I think Winnig London is the worst movie ever.Just Because they're 15 years old they think there old enough to do anything.And what's with all the kissing. Now that they're 15 they want tobe kissing in all their new movies. And I want to say toMAry-Kate and Ashley to stop with the kissing you guys are onlychilds and you guys think you're grown ups but you're not.
5,GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!,This movie was execellent it had a great storyline but i must admitt to not liking the character James he is played by Jesse Spencer and he is australian i regodnised him from a tv show that he used to be on a while ago i didn't like his fake posh accent and i was shocked to see him kiss mary-kate because he is like 10 years older than her. But appart from that i was a really good movie and i think that rileys boyfriend is HOT!!!!! This was better than some of the olsens previous movies and i think that mary-kate and ashley ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,worst movie...,"The only reason why I gave this even one star was because of everybody's effort to make the movie. Unfortunately, this movie was one of the worst ones I've ever seen. The Olsen twins are the exact same in each one of their movies, and it's getting old. If you're expecting a movie a little different, don't rent this one. It's just about a couple of twits running around London trying to save the day. Don't waist your time on Winning London."
3,Winning London,"I don't know how that movie even got to my house, I'm pretty sure my parents rented it. Since it was already in my house I decided to watch it. It's an okay movie. Mary-Kate and Ashley are cute as always. And of course they have pretty good boyfriends also. It's a great movie to watch with bunch of friends, girlfriends."
2,"Okay, but not the best MKA film","Mary-Kate stars as Chloe, and Ashley as Riley (NOT like So Little Tiime!) and they are heading off to London, to compete as China in the Model United Nations. But then they find a ""database error"" and another group is also doing China.They then have to do UK instead, and go around the UK doing research. Soppy love scenes make this movie gross, and not THAT interesting on the whole.London IS a fun place (I've been!) but they do not wear bubble dresses, they shop at Harrods!Not very good at all, I paid good money as well. Only buy it very cheaply for a 7-9 year old, any older and it'll be moan, moan, moan..."
4,This was a good movie,This was a good movie and the boys were cute it had a good story line and its worth buying. But i don't really like the english accent that james had it sounded a bit fake and i didn't like at the end how everyone kissed they were all in some sort of order but other than that it was good. I liked the blopperes at the end they were funny.
4,Pretty Good,"Winning London is not one of my favorite Mary-Kate and Ashley movies but it is still good because these girls are great. The movie starts with the girls' national relations team winning a trip to London. While there, of course the girls fall in love with two stunningly handsome boys, but while coupling up they must study for their contest. The group is very creative throughout the contest, but will their relationships cause a loss for their team?? Watch this great adventure to find out how the girls Win London!"
4,Winning my vote,"Winning London is a well-done children's movie with some glowing scenes. While the girl-meets-boy theme is, as always in an Olsen twins' movie, included, this movie is not so focused on it.The main point of the story is this: go to London to win a competition.The underlying stories that I love are these: a boy growing up and standing up for himself (the Peter Pan aspect), and a girl who learns and grows up (to be less competitive). These things really made the movie for me. A little bit of culture and comedy made me smile, and a somewhat more grown-up theme (than usual) for a twins' movie kept my interest.While there are very predictable scenes and sometimes annoying parts, the movie is worth seeing.In the end, the group doesn't so much ""win London"", but the each character wins a discovery of themselves and a new view on life. In this way, it wasn't the competition that made them grow so much as their experiences."
1,From a MUN buff,"I really wish Mary Kate and Ashley would research their topics a little before they decide to go be cute in their latest location. As an avid Model United Nations participant, I would like to say that YOU CAN'T WIN! Model UN at the high school level involves no points, no competitions, and most of all, NO WINNING! While there isn't nearly as much free time at real MUN competitions as Mary Kate and Ashley enjoy, what little time we have is often spent discussing how inaccurate this movie is and mocking it shamelessly."
1,Winning Hearts Winning Minds And Winning Stars!,"This moive is cool, but one thing about all their movies is they always get their way! They always win! That is so not a good story line! Another thing, they are always the only ones with cool clothes! Unfair! Also to much lip action, I mean why do they always have to have boyfriends? Its not like they are going to die without a boy! other than that it was pretty cool! Cool enough for one star at least!"
3,NOT A BAD DISC,"This band represents your typical generic TRADITIONAL-VINTAGE-LEGACY-POWER METAL with some heavy bottom and nice melodic leads, pretty good singing and a metalish anthem attitude.I liked track six - BAD DREAM which was pretty riffy heavy and catchy. CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT brought me back to the 80's when I hung out with so-called ""FRIENDS"" drinking beer and going to rock clubs and waving the devil horns.This disc represents a talented band but not worth spending more than $8.00 for. You must of heard this kind a metal flavor a thousand times over."
5,Best Of Dream Evil,"While cheesy at times, this is Dream Evil's best work and deserves all 5 stars. I can overlook the cheese because most of it kicks butt. Do not be nervous about buying it because people used the word ""cheese"" to describe it; it really is not that pronounced, so no worries. What you mostly get is hardcore riffs, good mid-tempo energy and music that gels nicely. If you like Heavy Metal and don't already have this, what are you waiting for?"
4,Note to fans,"Just wanted to let the peeps know out there because its really not made clear that , while a great disc & awesome band what many people don't realize is that this does NOT come in a digipack like the un-edit-ed version.. just wanted to let ya know.. it may not matter to alot of people but it bugged me.."
3,"Good, but not the best choice",This is good anatomy text - but by no means the best that is out there. Snell's diagrams are overly simplistic and often unclear as to the relation of other nearby structures. The text is accurate and very straightforward but lacking in some of the clinical applications. This volume is more suited for an undergrad anatomy class and even then I would suggest a different and more detailed text. Try Keith Moore's Clinical Anatomy it is far superior and will serve you better than this. Out of the dozens of various anatomy texts I own - this one comes off the bookshelf the least.
3,Excellent Text; Poor Diagrams,"This standard anatomy textbook for medical students is really a useful studying guide for mastering the structures and functions of the human body. The text is very clearly written with detailed descriptions. The book doesn't let you just memorize the names for every bit of the flesh, but also the 3D arrangement of any tissue and organ! But the diagrams are simply hand sketches which make the book less interesting."
5,wonderful,"I needed music for an intermediate ballet class. The music was very beautiful. The beat was nice and strong, which was very helpful."
1,Not worth the trouble,"I tried 3 brands of wireless cards, and the only one I had trouble with was the network everywhere NWP11B. The card would not connect to three different networks. Got a warranty replacement, and the second card will sometimes connect.This card is missing an important feature - you can't set the WEP encryption key using a passphrase. Better brands will let you use ASCII text, (your dog's name or some other phrase) to generate the 64 or 128 bit key. Even with the new firmware, this card requires you to translate the passphrase into hexadecimal, and then type in a 26 digit number. Twice.This is not fun, especially because the card often will not connect, and you will be typing this number in over and over.Unless you are good at memorizing 26 digit hexadecimal numbers, buy something else."
2,Hot Air,"Dr. Liberman sounds like a caring person who believes in his untested theories. However, theories they are. His view of myopia sums up as ""bad thoughts equal bad vision"". I know people of all temprements, some have myopia and some don't. He seems to respect the views of W. Bates, and reprints some of his methods. In short, buy the Bates book."
3,Great book - I as well would like to see an online group,"The book reiterated other eye exercises and mental insights I had read previously, but there cannot be enough books out there on this subject. I practiced the techniques, and stopped my vision from getting worse. My prescription was -7.50 in both eyes, and was getting worse at about -.25 every year or so. Not only did I stop my eyes from getting worse, I reversed them, and I am now at a -7.25 prescription. I have plateaued at this level, but must admit, I have not been exercising my eyes as vigorously as when I first started. I have had problems finding an eye doctor that supports this method of treatment. In fact, when my presciption went down and I told him what I had been doing, he totally blew me off, and told me that the previous doctor must have examined my eyes wrong and given me too strong of a prescription."
5,"good, but not all there is","Liberman's an optometrist who realized the truths of vision and glasses that are obvious to anyone who takes the time to study the topic, and consequently he changed his ways of thinking about vision and about the entire being. The beginning sections of some vision improvement books can be like reviews for people who are already familiar with it, and this book is no exception, but as with other authors, he does offer valuable insights that other authors don't, and I recommend this book."
5,Very cool bands and advice,"This is a very cool book -- its like getting a personal tour of the different studios, with 311, korn, snoop dogg (nice) and other people... I really like the Michael Beinhorn part, everyone talks smack about the music biz but he actually seems to know the game from both sides... That and the parts about Darin from SOAD and the guitar sound were my favorites. Also really liked the details on the equipment to get, whether its a tube mike or just foam board for your basement."
4,Informative,I learned a great deal reading this and was sometimes quite surprised by revelations. Especially pleased to learn that at least 4 of the presidents were informed by my own religious background!
4,This is a good camera,"I love my Vivitare Vivicam. I have know downloaded over 130 pictures to my computer. The pictures are very clear. The first day I used my camera I used up four AA batteries, but then I bought two rechargeable AA batts. and a charger and I have been using that camera every day and the two AA's have lasted over five days now. My mom also really loves this camera, she wants to get one herself. But I recommend this digital camera for people who have never had a digital camera before."
1,Do not recommend this camera,"I received this camera for Christmas. As the other reviewers have said, I was very excited. I am not a photo enthusiast. I only use my camera to keep in touch with friends around the country via email. I do not print pictures nor do I do anything fancy.Other than the battery life issue, the camera and I were getting along reasonably well. The only exception was that it was hard to take pictures in crowds. The angle of the lens was too wide and I would have to crop the picture down to be able to focus on my friends.Last week, it stopped accepting batteries for no reason. The batteries died and it would not charge up when I added new ones. I tried several different brands, to no avail.I've ordered a Kodak 4MP camera on a competing website that I get a student discount on. I hope that camera works out better for me.As for this camera, I would not recommend it."
5,Exceptional quality at a great price,"I bought two of these cameras, one for each of my children. After shopping around at Staples, and several other stores, I was pleasantly surprised to find such a value with both the digital and optical zoom (a key selling point). The cameras were immediately put to task, and with the aid of a memory card, both my kids are using the camera and video features with ease! What a deal!!!"
3,An Okay Camera,"My brother bought this camera for me for Christmas because I wanted at least a 3 mega pixel camera. It's an okay camera for normal use. The zoom is good and the functions are easy to use. I liked the fact that it took AA's. One big problem is that the battery power does not last long and the camera doesn't warn you of low power. You could be snapping away and all of a sudden it doesn't stay on. The battery meter is useless. As far as the pictures, the quality is fine. One other strange bug is when I took one picture, it disappeared even though it took, it must have been some weird bug. Under low flash or no flash, or higher zoom, when the pictures are printed, the quality is blurred. Overall, it's a good camera if you are not trying to be professional. I just recently lost my camera and I will probably buy a better one that doesn't eat up batteries so fast."
2,Stopped working 2nd time I used it......,"I received this camera as a gift and thought I would love it as it seemed fairly basic. It broke the second time we used it. The door to hold in our SD memory card would not stay shut. The internal memory would not store our pictures, it kept erasing them right as we took the pictures. Very frustrating!! I would not recommend this camera, there are more reliable ones for the same cost."
2,Vivitar Vivicam......hhmmmmm,"I want to start off by saying that I am an advanced photographer. My mom bought me this camera for Christmas (my first digital) and I was very excited at first. I, very excited, plopped in the AA batteries that this camera requires, and starting taking some pictures. After about ten (with flash) the batteries go dead. In all, I had to change the batteries three times on Christmas day. The quality of the pictures are okay, but not the best. I began despising the camera and eventually (within a month) bought the new Canon Digital Rebel, which is obviously a camera in a completely different league. If you or the person that you are buying the camera for are photography enthusiasts, rethink the purchase. I gave this camera back to my mom (she didn't have a camera at all) and she is excited about it, but she has no clue regarding photography. All she knows is that she loves the pictures that I take, even though good pictures were NEVER taken with this camera."
4,Good deal,"This is an excellent camera for the price.Perfect for everyday use, with one draw-back . . . if using standard alkaline, carry lots of batteries. They are used up quickly."
1,Incompatible with Lumix FZ18,I was ordering the new Lumix FZ18 and I weighed the advantages and risks of buying this discount battery: $7 opposed to $44; you get what you pay for; is it too good to be true; what a savings. I took a chance and was in the middle of shooting an event I had been requested to cover when the battery supplied with my FZ18 ran down. I go to switch to my bargain battery and it doesn't fit all the way into the battery slot. So much for the event photos. So much for my bargain hunting.
1,do not buy it!!!! with fz18,i bought with fz18 camera but it didn`t fit so if you want to second battery find orginal one..
4,CGR-S006,I bought this battery to serve as a backup to my camera's OEM battery. It works very well and actually has a lot more storage capacity. I use it with my new Panasonic LUMIX DMC-fF18K camera. It gives about 500 photo's between charges.. Thats a LOT of shooting for any one.. It fits right in the OEM charger and works great... I give it **** stars.
1,2 of 3 batts DEAD ON ARRIVAL,"I bought 3 of these. 2 were dead on arrival. NO, 0, ZERO, Volts. I have more volts running through me than these 2 batteries did through them, quite literally. Eforcity does not return my attempts at contact. Never buy from Eforcity, never buy these batteries."
1,not received yet,"thought i would get it on time, however i have left texas, mail does not forward packages, we are now at 8010 via sardinia way apt 117, estero fl 33928"
2,No es exactamente la referencia,"La bateria que llego es referencia CGA-S006E, y a pesar de que si entra en la cámara no es exactamente la referencia ofrecida, no estoy seguro de usarla en mi cámara FZ-28"
1,I am a Christian and I thought this book was horrid.,"As a Christian who homeschools, I am always reading books on homeschooling. I found the entire tone of this book to be condescending and presumptive. Not only was there no useful information, but some of the information was downright harmful. She talks about learning difficulties being due to the child being ""sinful"", and gives no credence at all to learning disabilities. As the mom of an autistic child, I found this beyond disgusting and in direct conflict with Jesus' message. She also proudly boasts that she hits her kids to discipline them. Puke-worthy. She gives Christian homeschoolers a bad name with this book."
2,"Off-putting to non-christians and too chatty, to boot.","I wrote ""the ultimate guide to Debra Bell"" inside the front cover and gave it to Goodwill. Too much yap-yap-yap about her and her beliefs. This was the very first book on homeschooling I read and it was rather depressing to read that the only possible way to be a successful homeschooler (she says this outright...no mincing of words) was to be ""called by god"" to homeschool. Luckily, the rest of the book was sloppy enough for me to completely discount her opinion and move on to more encouraging resources.If you are fundamentalist AND love a chatty, personal style (think of a talentless Erma Bombeck), you will probably like this book."
3,"Good, but...","I borrowed this book from the library to help me decide whether I wanted to spend the money. As other reviews have posted, the author has a significant christian bias. This was not indicated on the cover, but it seemed that every other page mentioned that the reason you are homeschooling is because of your faith and that this will get you through any problems that spring up. This turned me off significantly, not because I am anti-christian, but because I feel that you can solve your own problems with a bit of advice, and that advice was not found in the book.There was helpful information on homeschooling, but not nearly enough for me to spend the money to buy the book. There are other reasons for homeschooling besides your faith, and the author seems to not understand that."
5,"Yes, you can!","I love this book and it will always hold a special place in my heart. This book convinced me I could do what I knew was the best for my kids. It's a bit overwhelming at times, but that's expected for someone so new to the homeschooling world. I read Lisa Welch's introductory book before and I'd recommend other mother's considering homeschooling to do the same. God bless you for serving your family as God intended."
2,This book is geared toward the conservative Christian view.,"As soon as this author revealed that she thought creationism was science, I knew I would have trouble with this book. In spite of some quite helpful information for beginning homeschoolers, I found myself feeling leary of her curriculum references. Anybody who raves about curriculum materials put out by Bob Jones University is automatically a bit suspect. I kept encountering statements such as ""I have not found any positions that conflict with our (Christian) beliefs."" Was this the royal ""our""? As a Christian of a different persuasion, I found such remarks out-of-place and presumptuous. If you dislike religious indoctrination you would likely find a different homeschooling book to be more helpful and certainly less annoying."
2,"When it's good, it's very good...","and when it's bad, it's worse!As a Pagan, I was really turned off by all the Christian ideology and preaching found in the book, BUT because it had some good, solid information, I bought it anyway. I also was quite offended how the author states towards the end about using ""Biblical Discipline"" and spells out ""S-P-A-N-K-I-N-G"". Ummm... excuse me, lady, but corporal punishment is O-U-T!As a mother, I liked how the author spoke in her own words and expressed herself, and admitted her own faults. We all have them. I really tried to like the book, but I found myself glossing over so much crap and fluff, especially the repeated references to order from Bob Jones University! ROFL! ROFL! ROFL!The Ultimate? Hardly!"
5,excellent information,"Having read several of the reviews I was encouraged to buy this book as my first home schooling book. I found the book excellent and even though many of the resources are designed for the US market, it inspired me to look into what is available locally. I thought their CHESS idea was excellent, why not pool different parent talents in teaching! Even though it is published in 97 there were still quite a few resources on the net for kids, imagine what it is like now...it certainly will make home schooling a much more viable option to those in smaller countries where the home schooling market is just not big enough for the publishers to really focus on. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like a well balanced resource on what your in for ...time, money and knowledge wise"
5,The Perfect Adventure Epics,"The Sinbad movies are a tribute to the brilliant imagination of Charles Schneer, the producer, and Ray Harryhausen, the special effects creator. These movies, although independent of each other in story and in continuity, tell the fabulously rich story of the legendary Sinbad's exploits. The movies are not perfect and the computer effects of today are more real, but no CGI character has ever captured the amount of creativity, heart, or vibrancy that Harryhausen's creations possess. From the Dragon to the Cyclops to the Centaur to the Gryphen to Harryhausen's signature creation, the Skeleton Warrior no movie series has given us such an amazing plethora of creatures and beasts of fancy for the audience to marvel at. Sinbad is the penultimate hero of adventure and myth and these movies are prime examples of Ray Harryhausen's sheer genious at work."
5,Fun movies: Can enjoy watching them over and over again!,"I first watched the Sinbad movies as a young child. All these years later I still love every one of them. They are fun, family friendly, entertaining, nostalgic, and just plain cool. I should have purchased this a long time ago. The claymation is so neat. I'll never get tired of that concept. In my opinion, these movies are so much better than movies of today. Watch these once and you will see what I mean. Have fun. :)"
3,"Counterpoint to ""Eye of the Tiger marred by nudity""","Referring to the critical review titled ""Eye of the Tiger marred by nudity"":Just to help clarify the ""adult content"" in the Eye of the Tiger, there is no nudity in this film. There is partial nudity, consisting of brief flashes of female skin, but at no time is there any frontal nudity and there is nothing remotely sexual in nature. The film is rated ""G"", after all.The critical review in question, however, suggests that there is a reason to protect your children from this film. There isn't. There is, on the other hand, reason to protect your children from reviews like that one."
1,Eye of the Tiger marred by nudity,"If you are buying this collection for your children, be forewarned that the '70s ""Eye of the Tiger"" contains a shot of the naked princess sitting on a rock combing her hair after a bath in the nearby pond (knowing that Sinbad's scruffy sailors are in the vicinity). Had I known about this scene, I would have purchased the 7th Voyage and the Golden Voyage separately. The Eye of the Tiger has no redeeming qualities. As per the pacifist political correctness of its day, all of the film's conflict melts away before anyone has to use any force to defend themselves, so the plot plods along from one non-event to another. Harryhausen's effects were wasted on this film that my kids enjoyed less than the Popeye cartoon version of Sinbad."
5,Ray Harryhausen is phenomenal! These are some of his best.,The special effects are wonderful. Ray Harryhausen was instrumental in the making of these movies and they are a tribute to his ability to bring fatasy to life. Sinbad the mythical sailor will never come to life as he does in these three renditions of the tales of his exploits.
4,Sunlite cloud 9 bike seat,"very comfortable. Good size, the ideal size that I was looking for. Worth the prize and really stands out and makes my bike look good."
2,MEASURE YOUR SEATPOST CLAMP BEFORE YOU BUY,"The rails on this saddle are approximately 54-55 millimeters apart, measured from outside edge to outside edge. My aluminum seatpost clamps, the single bolt aluminum ""sandwich"" type clamp common on many if not most average-priced seatposts, have rail grooves that are no more than 50 millimeters apart, outside edge to outside edge.The rails and the grooves have the same diameter; diameter is not the issue. The rails are just too far apart for both of them to sit in both grooves of the clamp simultaneously, and they can't be made to fit.So, to avoid disappointment, and the unnecessary expenditure of time and money, I'd recommend that you measure the relevant dimensions of your seatpost clamp before you make your purchase decision."
2,Not very practical,"Eels, honeycomb tripe, veal knuckles, pig's feet, gooseberries, oxtail, quahogs and lamb neck - just some of the many oddd ingredients in this book. I was looking for something to make for a simple dinner. This is definitely not it! I was very disappointed. The book was printed in 1982 and there has been no update of any kind."
1,Will not use this book much!,"I did not care for this book at all. The recipes call for too much fat (butter, heavy cream, sour cream, cheese, etc.) I would've liked to see calorie count because these soups look way too fattening. A major dissapointment."
2,Sticks out of Protoge 2000,"I bought this for my Toshiba Protoge 2000 because they said it was compatible. Unfortunately, although it fits in the slot, it sticks out about 1/8 inch all the way around the bottom. So technically it will work with the laptop but it doesn't fit flush like the original battery. I'll probably keep it because my original battery no longer held a charge but just wanted to get the word out there in case anyone else is looking at purchasing the replacement battery."
1,"It may be wonderful, but...","This classical music set may be a wonderful set, but amazon.com packed it for delivery inadequately. The CD box that contains the CD set was damaged during shipping. What a shame; I had to return it."
2,The Complete Mozart,"I have the Philips set, which cost me just over Aussie Dollars 1000.00 Thank you for the reviews. I now feel that the price I paid for the Philips set was justified. No, I'm not a PhD in music - just a soild amateur. I do have the Briliant Bach set, and I'm very happy with that. Oh, yes - I've just ordered the Haydn. Maybe I'll post a review on that!"
5,Mozart Complete from Brilliant,"I just received my box from Amazon Fr. Yes, it truly cost 86 euro TOTAL. It was reduced to 75 as I was not part of EU and then with shipping it was 86 which comes to about 100 dollars. Fantastic bargain and the music is of a high calibar. The set is organized very well without a waste of space and the liberetti and notes are on a disc that has PDF files which when printed are defaulted to a size to print and then slip into the cd sleeves perfectly. Well thought out and of a quality that is surprising. Am listening to the String Trio at the moment and it's sublime and of a high quality. Better grab this deal while you can."
4,Even better deal,"Not to start any inter-EU rivalry, but Amazon.fr is offering it at 90 euro, and the price drops to 75 euro if you're shipping to the US (no VAT). That pretty much pays for shipping. It's a wonderful collection, even if--as to be expected--the quality of the performances varies from disk to disk."
5,A Great Collection,This is an excellent collection of Mozart. I wish more composers had sets like this. The performances and quality of recordings are far beyond the cost. This set is a must have for music lovers.
3,Pretty Good,Got two of these boken for myself and my 4 year old to practice with. received them quickly that was good. The tsuba that coms with them does not fit you should reshape it before trying to put it on as I broke one of them. but bokken it's self is pretty good.
4,Steal for the price,"Purchased for my young son's Halloween costume, this is a quality product worth many times more than the price. I wouldn't recommend striking another wooden sword with it, but for a costume or display, it is top notch."
4,Nice sword,"I actually got this a week early. It's a great wooden sword for the price. The only thing wrong with it was that when I took a close look at it, I found a small split in the wood at the tip but nothing too bad. I just fixed it with a little super glue. Overall it's a great sword. I would recommend this to a friend."
2,superficial and under-illustrated,"I am a professional hairdresser and hairdressing historian. I was terribly disappointed when I opened this book. It has very few useful illustrations, particularly for hair before the 20th c The fact checking was sloppy and there are many factual errors that a lay person would not be able to catch. Heavy reliance on website information reduces one's ability to check facts. Use as bathroom reading only, not as an authority for scholarly work."
3,Hair History Review,too few pictures - good reading - but still wanting more information on the many countries/time periods covered
3,Poor formatting spoiling the Kindle version,"Doesn't anybody proofread these Kindle versions of books? I purchased this book last night and only a few pages in the numerous typos and formatting errors are making reading it a chore and not an enjoyment.Bad punctuation, capitalization where it is not needed, paragraph breaks in the middle of sentences and on and on. The publisher wouldn't let the printed version of a book go out like this, so why let the electronic version have numerous errors in it?"
5,Linda (A Scot In U.S.A),"Tremendous book . I had Read It Several Years ago , When i was in the Uk, saw it on Amazon , and read it again .Martin Mc Gartland is a tribute to the Irish People .A young man who became an agent for the special branch, knowing that if he was found out by the IRA it would mean Torture , then certain Death.....He was known as 'agent Carol' and gave vital information which saved many lives both protestant and catholic.His title of the book ""Fifty Dead Men Walking"" is an understatement , i truly believe he saved alot more than fifty.It is an essential read, and also to read his second book ""dead Man Running"" Thankyou Martin , for all you have sacrificed....."
3,Vivid portrayal of Britain's reliance on IRA informers,"Martin McGartland takes us far from the comfort and warmth of our living room to the violent and poverty stricken world of the Catholic ""ghetto"" in Belfast, where kids grow up to expect not only a beating from their parents but also from British army foot patrols. McGartland, torn between his own people and his strong sense of right from wrong, writes in a simple yet entertaining manner and the story reaches its horrific climax without ever waning or losing the readers interest. Having been forced to flee Ireland and adopt a new identity, you can't help wondering what Martin McGartland is doing today, and what now motivates him having lived through such an ordeal."
1,Was this written by a school boy?,Too many spelling mistakes to enjoy this book. Hard to get into because of the spelling mistakes. Will not read any more by this author.
3,Not as much...,"Not as much fun as the original 'Minds Eye' or ""Beyond the Minds Eye"". But still enjoyable as a sensory tool for students with ASD."
5,video tutor pre- algebra,If you buy this tape your life will be easy. This Tape will teachyou algebra in a simple way. No more excuse to fail algebra.
1,NOTHING NEW!!,"I was glad I did not purchase this book! I would not recommend it as a book that sheds any new light on the ""holistic approach"" to healing. It was the same old basic information that can be obtained by going to the local library or visiting any web site on line. I would give this book zero stars, but since there is no zero listed to give, I gave it a ""1"""
5,Plot Twists Worthy of a Roller Coaster Novel!,"After a famous wooden roller coaster injures passengers with the violence of the ride, an engineer hired to evaluate new safety modifications must analyze and diagnose a disturbing series of malfunctions before the grand re-opening.Thrill features an engaging cast of characters: the stalwart and straight-laced mid-western engineer, the mad genius of a coaster designer who resents others tampering with his work, the salty maintenance man who resents being second-guessed, the beautiful fairground worker who knows more than she says, and the coaster fanatic ready for the first ride. The twists and turns Byrne weaves into the plot are worthy of a novel about coasters and the men who design, build, and analyze them.Thrill was also made into a 1996 TV Movie."
2,Not up to the hype,It is very cheap software. Does not really have any leaning workshops at all. All it does is quiz you which isn't bad but definately is not worth the price.
3,It could be better,"I am a high school Chemistry teacher and I bought the ChemTutor Excalibur software hoping to use it as a review tool for my students. It has some good information, but I was very disappointed in the lack of animations or diagrams that would prove extremely useful in explaining chemical concepts. It is a fairly good review tool, but I am not sure it is worth the money.They could come up with a more interactive and interesting program especially for chemistry."
5,Textbooks Beware!,"I have progressed quickly through loads of material in my Chemistry class, using only ChemTutor Excalibur. The ""Learn"" function effectively replaces your standard Chemistry textbook, and is all a student needs to learn either basic or advanced chemistry. Many students, including myself, have found the information on ChemTutor easier to grasp than its textbook equivalent.ChemTutor is also wonderful for test preparation. It's the only tool I need to study! The textbook, the quiz preparation, and the sample term exams are all included in a single CD-ROM!I wholeheartedly recommend ChemTutor Excalibur for the fastidious chemistry student, and for the teacher who wishes to do away with heavy textbooks. It's a lifesaver!"
3,So-So,I brought this program because I thought that it would give me detailed information concerning chemistry math which is what I was looking for and needed at the time. I did not find it to be very much help to me in the math section but was basically okay for the detailed chemistry section.
5,I totally agree with Ms. Caroline Leach!,"OH MY GOD! How did Interactive Learnings, Inc. come up with such a software! This is a work of genius, and I am grateful for ChemTutor Excalibur, because it has helped me so much for me to earn a A+ in my advanced chemistry course!To be honest, I am not a science guy, and I never was, until my friend suggested this great program, ChemTutor Excalibur. ChemTutor Excalibur has helped me to see a whole new world of chemistry. With Test Simulation mode, you can choose any part of chemistry that seems most challenging to you, and be tested on many different varieties of questions. In addition to that, with clear explanations for every single problems, even you can be a chemistry master in no time! If you want a A+ in your chemistry course, get ChemTutor Excalibur, NOW. You will not regret it, and I guarantee it. I LOVE CHEMTUTOR!"
5,"YOUR CHEMISTRY FRIEND, CHEM TUTOR EXCALIBUR~",I am glad that I got a chance to have Chem Tutor Excalibur this year. Chem Excalibur helped me to learn more stuffs about the subject of matters and to feed back the course. I am now getting good grades on the class by solving problems every night before the tests and quizes. It has many kinds of problems to examine your chem ability. You can also look over the wrongs from explanations and notes. It is very very well-made for you to study by yourself. There is no better chem materials than Excalibur!
5,its the best,chem tutor excalibur has helped me greatly this year in chemistry. My grade was a solid C befor i started using this product. As i started using it more and more throughout the week i could see my improvements in the class room. My homework and test average had started to go up.It teaches you the material and then quizes you on it. Its a great tool for learning.
5,ChemTutor Excalibur: An excellent study tool.,"After receiving a C on my Chemistry test I decided to get some additional help so I invested in ChemTutor Excalibur. By using this wonderful tool my future test scores improved tremendously. I finally started to understand chemistry better. My parents were amazed at the improvements of my grades and thought for a ""C"" student like me that it would be impossible to get A's. I told them it would have been impossible if I didn't have this wonderful product. Also the product is user friendly so a computer illiterate person like myself can easily maneuver around the program. I would reccommend ChemTutor Excalibur to all Chemistry students to improve their knowledge of Chemistry."
4,Chemistry,"This product, is more for high school students. I am currently taking a chemistry class, and this program, seems a little under my program that I'm taking, but a good refresher."
5,ChemTutor.,I am very happy with this product. I recommend ChemTutor to all who need that extra edge in getting through and understanding a bit more about chemistry.
5,The absolute best learning source for chem!,"Science was the most difficult subject for me. Chem Tutor Excalibur, however, helped me a lot to study Chemistry very easily. Compared to other sources, Chem Tutor has the most understandable explanations that I can get help from. It has the most essential materials that high school students need to learn in Chemistry. It well prepares students for SAT2 Chemistry test as well as other chemistry related testings. It has very brief but core information that students need to know. It is the best source for studying Chemistry! I strongly recommend to other teenagers who are struggling studying Chemistry =)"
1,poor software...beware of phony reviews,"In my opinion, this software is useless. Show me the learning! Please scrutinize carefully the reviews on product, I suspect they are paid reviewers and their claims that this product produced ""A""s are false."
5,HELPED ME TREMEDOUSLY,"This program helped boost my grade, it let me understand what nomeclatures really are. If I could use any product to help me with chemistery I would use this. It helped boost my grade well above from what it once was. I give this product of 1-10 rating 10+"
1,ChemRIPoff,"I should have listened to the negative reviews about this product. You only get like 20 or more of the SAME practice problems for each subject and there is no ""tutoring"". No where in the product description does it state that you should already KNOW chemistry. To top it all off, the software feels dated. Forty dollars for this program.... Its not worth 5. I would rather have someone punch me in the face before getting ripped off like this again. I can't believe all the positive reviews either, very fishy."
5,excellent,This is an excellent book if you want to understand Electrodynamics for what it really is-a relativistic field theory!
5,THE LEGEND SAYS IT ALL,ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS A LEGEND IN IT'S SELF. LISTEN TO ME REMINDS ME OF BACK IN THE DAY WHEN I USE TO GO OUT TO THE CLUBS AND THE GUYS WOULD BE BREAK DANCING ON THE FLOOR. (AHHH THE GOOD OLE DAYS) THIS CD IS A CLASSIC A MUST BUY!
3,Unfinished Business Unfortunately!,"I remember catching Baby Huey and the Babysitters show 2 or 3 times during the 70's. They were an excellent and exciting band. Jim McCarty was playing guitar with them. I have had the vinyl version of this record for many years and it is one of those records that I never played very often. After buying this record in cd form and listening to it again here recently, I know why. It dawned one me that Baby Huey died before completing this album project. He only sings on about 3 tunes and raps throughout 'Mighty, Mighty'. It was common knowledge around Chicago that Baby Huey and the band composed the song 'Mighty, Mighty', not Curtis Mayfield. Curtis did compose some hipper lyrics for the song and sang it on the Impressions album 'Young Mods Forgotten Story'. Listeners of this record are left with fond memories of an exciting show band and/or an album that would have been exceptional."
3,"Pop singer, works well with swing jazz musicians","Ms. Allen does not have Diane Krall's cool so don't be mislead by the previous. However, the previous reviewer did describe her as contemporary pop which seems accurate. I believe the liner notes describe her as a breathy alto. Sometimes she reminds me of Maria Muldaur or Allison Krauss. Most of the songs are in a romantic vain. Nothing really up tempo. Bill Cunliffe is the leader, pianinst."
5,"Regarding Science-Ejected Vitalism, 1998:","Vitalism is a profoundly science-ejected concept, though many CAM or 'natural health' cabals falsely claim that vitalism survives scientific scrutiny.One of my favorite passages from this book:""the achievements of molecular biology in the twentieth century proved conclusively that it is not necessary to propose that life processes arise from some nonmaterial vital principle and cannot be explained entirely as physical and chemical phenomena. [E.g.] biological neural networks are created by nature, and the laws of nature should be applicable to them [p.003].""-r.c."
2,Boy or Girl ??,This book just confused me ... i clearly saw male genital parts when i had my ultrasound yet most of the tests in the book as well as the chinese chart say its a girl. Science over fiction ? or were the doctor and I just seeing things? lol
5,Great for a shower!,"This book has a bunch of cute, fun tests to ""determine"" if a baby is a boy or a girl. We played it at a baby shower for a couple who decided not to find out. We passed it around and every guest got to ask the couple a question and we tallied the answers up at the end to determine the sex! Still don't know if it worked though! it is fun but i am not too sure how serious it is! A great gift and party game!"
4,FUN READ,The best part of this book is the Chinese Conception Chart. It has correctly predicted the gender of ALL THREE of my kids! I always give this book to expecting mothers and tell them to check the chart!
3,FUN!,I BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR THE FUN OF IT! IT'S EXCITING TO DO SOME OF THE TESTS TO SEE WHAT THE SEX OF YOUR BABY WILL BE WILE YOUR PREGNANT. SOME OF THE TEST YOU CANT DO BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE ALL OF THE STUFF YOU NEED THATS WHY I GOVE IT 3 STARS...BUT OVERALL IT'S GREAT & WOULD MAKE A GREAT GIFT TO YOUR FRIEND OR LOVED ONE WHO IS EXPECTING.
5,$10 cheaper than anywhere else,The K&N brand speaks for itself. I got this one on Amazon for $10 cheaper than anywhere else.
2,Great but far to short,Groovy tracks great surfing but NOT WORTH THE MONEYITS UNDER 30MINS which is highly dissapointment
1,26 min until the end credits start rolling!,This should be a DVD bonus feature to Thicker Than Water or something. $15 for 26 min? Seriously?
1,Way too short and confusing,"I should have known better than to order a DVD sight-unseen that did not have a time for the length of the film posted. The surfing scenes were good, but at about a half hour, the film was way too short, plus the dialog with the surfers never told you a story. If I hadn't looked at the package, I would not have known where they were surfing. Spend a few more dollars and buy the much better Step Into Liquid."
2,Not as good as it gets!,"I have viewed several surf movies, and I guess I was expecting to get pumped on this one. Several reviews were right on the money since it is a very laid back movie. Too short. If your looking for short and just ok, this is it."
5,Simple Mellifluous Ocean Waters w a twist of funk.,Sweet shots sweet music by Jack J and his crew. Faces tell stories. I'm not a real surfer but it doesn't matter cause the 16mm film used and the pictures it produced tells a story about something even greater than Surfboarding. If your into things that are great i guess.
2,Nothing Special!,If you are looking for a great surfing video this one is not what you are looking for. Nice waves and rides but nothing special. One or two good Pipeline or Makaha waves are much more better. I would not recommend it!
2,I wouldnt get it again,"Pretty of course, but the link holding the puzzle charm quickly fell off. Wouldn't buy again and I sure wouldn't pay that much for it. I would say search elseware."
5,Sharpe's Peril,"Sharpe's Peril completes my set of Sharpe DVD's. I saw the whole original series on TV when it first came out. It is a very good period piece, well acted, good storyline, good scenery. Watching it on DVD is much better than the original TV screening. The picture quality and sound are much better. Sean Bean and Daragh O'Malley are excellent actors and really bring the action to life."
3,Great Adventure Romp/4 stars - Ridiculously high price/no stars,"Any fan of the series will enjoy this 16th outing for Sharpe and Harper. On par with 2006's ""Sharpe's Challenge"". The larger budget really shows in the scale of the scenes over the tv series.Not sure why anyone would buy it from Amazon US though. They want $29.99+$2.98 shipping for a Pal format Region 2 DVD. That is twice the price from Amazon UK - $12.94+$5.00 after converting from pounds sterling. It is the same DVD!!! I love British Drama and Mystery and have ordered lots from Amazon UK - never took more than 7 days to arrive. Why would anyone pay over $15.00 more just to have it arrive 1-2 days sooner. Amazon still gets your money - just not twice as much!"
4,Great for tourism and more,"Whether you are planning to visit Vancouver as a tourist, or you are doing preliminary research about it as a potential permanent destination later in your life, Lonely Planet Vancouver sums it all up nicely for you. The first few pages do a great job of giving the newcomer a birdseye view of the city's composition, lifestyle, culture, etc. The book moves on to cover other aspects from dining to outdoors activities and much more in a detailed yet not overwhelming way.The only shortcoming this guide (as well as other Lonely Planet books) has is a lack of more pictures, which other series such as DK's Eyewitness Travel Guides excel at. However the competing book about Vancouver in that series is nowhere near as comprehensive as this one."
2,Unorganized,"The book contains a lot of information for sure. The thing is for a first time visitor it does not really provide a big help. Which things are a must to see? The book does not say. Instead the reader is forced to read each every section of the book because the book is divided into sections, each covering a part of the city.All in all it is a bit disappointing."
3,Travel,"I tend to buy a small guide to carry around and a bigger one such as lonely planet that has more indepth information, but this trip I didn't use the lonely planet that much and stuck with the Top 10 travel guide most of the time, although I suppose it helped that I was visiting someone who lives in Vancouver. I highly recommend the top 10 guide (much better to carry around for quick access of info.) The benefit of the Lonely planet guide I think is to use it ahead of time when planning things out and using the book info to supplement internet research."
3,Might as well have bought a Fodor's,"Perhaps erroneously, I expect Lonely Planet guides to cater to the smart and budget-conscious traveler. Far too many of the hotels and especially the restaurants in this guide were waaay out of my price range. Further, the writer recommends Granville Island as a must-see of artists studios and a farmer's market, when it was actually a Disneyland version of such. Lastly, her chipper enthusiasm for diversity-as-consumer-product chafed. Better to get Douglas Coupland's City of Glass; it's not a guidebook per se, but it's a better guide."
3,in regards to...,I read the review for the Lonely Planet's Vancouver edition and I would like to clarify one thing. Chinatown is great during the day! There is a point around the main intersection of Chinatown that is unsafe at night but as long as you mind your business you will be just fine.
1,why?,"Why do they keep making these ""Mozart (and other composers) for..."" CDs? I know I know. For idiots to buy them of course so the record company can make tons of money. But I feel it's an insult to classical music. No offense but Mozart didn't write this music for your unborn child. He couldn't care less to tell you the truth. I think he'd be pretty mad seeing how his music is being exploited these days. Why can't people just buy and listen to classical music as it was intended. Buy a set of Mozart's violin concertos or maybe Don Giovanni if you're so inclined. But not this ""potpourri excerpts from his work"" trash. Another option is to listen to the local classical radio station. Gosh, these kinds of CDs have gone too far. What's next - ""Tchaikovsky for Taking a Dump""? Sheeesh....Don't suport this if you care about preserving an art..."
5,Solid,"A solid mystery with good characters, good pacing, interesting backstory (more revealed in next book) a likeable protagonist and wonderful overlay of information about search and rescue dogs."
2,Why confront the murderer?,"Although this is well written, I can't bear a book where the (almost always female) ""investigator"" confronts the murderer in an isoated place alone and unarmed. Is it too much to ask the author to figure out a way to get the info needed from the confrontation scene without making the heroine out to be a total idiot."
3,"Good start, but hoepfully will improve","I'm a sucker for a dog story, so I had to snag this one. The story itself was interesting and the mystery convincing, it had some flaws.Why is she holding a new dog up to the old dog's standards? I'm sorry but I haven't met a dog person yet who feels one dog will replace another. I got tired of hearing her put this poor dog down over and over again.And seriously, when it comes to rescue, who cares about saving face? If I had to hear her whine one more time about just not being sure or not wanting to be embarrassed again there was going to be an issue. A kid's life is at stake. Such up your pride, eat crow, and do whatever you can to save her. that's why you joined a rescue team you idiot.Um, are we setting up the ex to not be the ex anymore? Cause I gotta say... not a fan of the idea."
3,"A Page Turner, But.....","This book kept my attention throughout. I really like Raine and having a mystery take place in the Smoky Mountains was wonderful. It is so beautiful there. The thing was she wasn't sure about her emotions. She went from refering to Buck as her exhusband to husband. How did that change so fast? I know she had feelings for him, but it seemed like it happened too fast. Also, the ending wasn't really tied together as most mysteries are. It was too open ended. Overall, I would read the next mystery in this series, but I need more closure."
4,fun and a new dog lover's mystery!,"a sassy new heroine and her search and rescue dog -- good story, great characters, fun read."
4,The Cisco Kid,"I am not an avid reader, in fact I might be considered a non reader, so the simple reads are my preference.I have ""Smokey Mountain Tracks"" on my Kindle, and fortunately I could take it any where I went (except the shower). I really enjoyed the story. I hated to put the book down. I enjoyed Mz Donna's style of writing.I would recomend this book to anyone that likes simple mysteries, and are into K9's. Especially Golden Retrievers, because the reader can relate to Cisco's actions and behaviors, and get some chuckles and even memories. Good book."
3,Jams after a year! Piece of crep!!,"I had nothing but good things to say about this printer. But wouldn't ya know it. Almost 1 yr to the day I bought it and now it constantly jams, misfeeds or spews out crep. The only reason I'd give it 3 stars is because it lasted pretty well the 1st yr. Now, I'm fed up. DH is gonna hit the roof when I tell him we have to buy yet another printer/all-in-one. I can't say I'm too sad because the cartridges are pretty expensive. Many stores that take old cartridges won't give you credit for Brother replacements. Walgreens won't refill Brothers either. Egads!!! Back to Canon, I guess. Epson bites too.Isn't it ironic that most printers live just past their warranty? It's a conspiracy, I tell ya!"
1,Not good,This printer has caused me much aggravation. It worked ok for about a year. Now I am constantly getting errors. I was hoping this would last longer than a year. I would not recommend buying this printer.
1,One problem after another,"I bought this machine without first checking the customer rating it had; big mistake. Mine CONSTANTLY experiences paper jams, mis-feeds, partial prints (for some reason), all of which have caused me to consume, WASTE, a ton of ink and paper. It spends 4 minutes cleaning itself each time I turn it on. It is very slow to receive data from my Mac and stops printing two or three lines into a page for some reason. And let's not forget the ink! THIS MACHINE IS VERY COSTLY TO OPERATE! I suppose if mine didn't jam all the time wasting so much paper, and ink I might not feel this way. Oh, did I mention the error message I get each time I plug it into my laptop; not even the Mac store can get it to go away without rebooting.The thing is a mess and was a total waste of my money. And I can't even throw it away; it's electronic! And it's going straight to the dump!"
1,Definitely NOT recommended!,"My mother bought this printer for me because she swore up and down that she owned the same model and it was great for her. I'm not sure if she was mistaken or I got a lemon, but I was only able to use this printer for 3 or 4 months, max. I never even made it past the cartridges that came with the printer. I got paper jams every time I tried to print, and now I guess I have an 'eternal' paper jam because it won't print at all now. I've tried everything, and I'm pretty handy with jams because I remove them all the time from a much larger printer at work. Yes, it was slower than a turtle, yes, it was always cleaning.. but at least it was better than nothing. Now I can't even say that..! What a piece of junk! I guess I'll be trying a Canon now."
1,Cheats you on ink,"This printer will tell you that its out of ink when the cartridge is still about 1/3 full. Then you have to go through the pain of taping over the window on each cartridge to get the printer to actually use the ink you paid for. In addition, the machine needlessly cleans itself ALL the time. You need to keep the printer unplugged or else all of your ink will vanish into thin air. I strongly urge you to look elsewhere."
1,Got it for free and still disappointed!!!!!!,"I received this printer for free and realized that its nothing more than a glorified door stop. Extremely slow and has a major problem with knowing how much ink is actually left in the cartridges. As pricey as ink is these days, when your printer tells you your cartridge is empty and you actually see that its still about half full, there's a problem.After the paper jams, ink snafus, and mystery freeze ups, the printer just stopped recognizing that a cartridge was installed period. No matter how many times I removed the cartridge and replaced it with a new one, it kept stating that I needed to install another because nothing was registering.Will make a youtube video soon with the error and subsequent destruction of the printer by brute force!"
1,This thing is JUNK!,"Horrible product, expensive ink and low quality prints. I will never buy another Brother product again. I don't really even want to waste my time writing the rest of this review because it is such a piece of garbage. There, now I have 20 words."
1,if I could give it less I would,"oh my, where do I start, have had this awful all in one for 4 years and I HATE IT.Paper jams galore, sucks in final sheet and then jams it, cant get out paper easilyRuns out of inks between uses (approx 5 pages then tells me ink is out)Now will only print black and white despite having all new cartridgesScanning is a joke as chews up more than 3 sheetsFaxing, well never fax an original or you could end up with shredsDONT BUY IT !!!No, seriously DO NOT BUY ITGetting a new one now as HAD ENOUGH!"
1,REALLY Disappointed,The black would not print at all! I went on line to find every tip possible and nothing worked.$55 dollars down the toilet.
1,"Want to go ""Office Space"" on this thing","Liked it for the first 3 months. But after this, will never buy anything from Brother again.1. Cleans the ink head so often that the color cartridges will be empty in a matter of months even though I never print anything in color. I'm curious about where this ink goes. 3 replacements of 3 color cartridges = 9 cartridges of vanished ink. Probably back into the cartridge I suppose.2. Once a cartridge is empty, the printer is basically a brick until you replace that cartridge. Want to print a B&W; text document? Not gonna happen if your yellow is empty.3. Paper jams. Seems to happen mostly with photo paper.4. Print quality is annoying. There are 4 quality settings. The highest is so much ink that it's blurry. The lowest is unreadable. Option 3 still uses too much ink, Option 2 uses not enough for something you want to present to someone important.Other thought: I've been using generic ink in this for more than a year and haven't had any problems."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I have NEVER had much trouble with printers. They get a few years old and just stop working. But I've had nothing but problems with this horrific device! From the beginning, the manual was in Chinese, the operation was so complicated that I had to refer to (and decipher) the manual over and over. Just changing the ink carts was ridiculous, as the stupid thing ALWAYS said ""no cartridge"" until you pounded the new one in with your fist (all three colors and black did the same thing). Had to ""clean"" the black each and every time I wanted to print a letter, resume, etc. More smudged and faded prints than should ever be put up with. Won't ALLOW you to print if the idiotic thing PERCEIVES that ink in ANY cartridge is low (even if it's almost half full)!!!! I would never buy anything from BroHoe again, and suggest you STAY AWAY!"
1,Oh Brother!,"After having bad luck with Lexmark inkjet and a Brother Laser printer I decided to try a Brother inkjet (MFC-240C)...it's the same old story...cheap price, expensive ink...free razor, expensive razor blades!The first ink cartridges worked fine, went fast. Bought a 4 pack of each color of aftermarket ink cartridges...so far so good. After the first aftermarket cartridges were depleted the machine has refused to recognize new cartridges aftermarket or Brother originals...nothing doing, calling customer service was useless. And since I cannot find my receipt, I now own another paperweight...service costs more than a new printer!Anybody want some ink?It was slow etc but it was enough for my home office needs.Another piece of junk!"
1,Worthless Machine,"I bought this for my wife's business. She gets the occasional fax and prints and scans on occasion as she usually works on site and not in the home office. After some time she needed to scan something - nothing but beeps. Apparently it does nothing if a cartridge is low. I got new carts, which are not cheap. It worked. I figured the ones that came from the factory are not full sized as I printed maybe a document or two to test the set up. A few months later she wanted to use it to print, sign and scan a timesheet. It would not work. Carts were low again. I spent $70 for new carts and it still would not print black. Cleaned over and over again. Nothing. I'm out a little over a hundred for the machine and well over a hundred for ink. I printed about 5 documents. My HP deskjet also goes long periods without printing but rarely has any issue. Pass on this dog."
2,Look elsewhere!,"This printer does a fine job of printing, faxing, scanning, and copying. The only complaint (but to me a major flaw) is that the printer uses the color cartridges up even if you do not print in color. I have set the default parameters to print in black (grayscale) only, and do not print anything in color. I STILL have to change all 3 color cartridges about every 3 months because they are empty. The factory rep (in India) explains that the printer cleans the cartridges to ensure proper ink flow, but it only uses a minute amount of ink to do so. That is simply not true.I have nothing but good things to say about Brother laser machines, but this ink jet machine is one to avoid."
1,umm...,"I brought this all in oneon sale about a year ago and sort of forgot about it. I recently pulled it out of the closet and hooked it up excited about all of its supposed capabilities. It was easy to install and the test page was beautiful. A couple days later, I sat down to print some directions and the paper somehow jammed. I removed the jam and have not been able to use this thing since because it is still reading a jam. I took it to a repair shop and they broke it completely down to find nothing. My one year warranty happened to expire before I got it out of the shop and I am stuck with a useless pile of nothing."
2,Ultimately Disappointing,"While the print quality of this machine is very good, it is a constant problem to use. The paper constantly jams if you try to use anything except plain paper. The feeder cannot handle photo paper, card stock or or any other special paper. Unless you plan on limiting your printing to very basic documents, I recommend not going with this printer."
2,Great printer - but (Big) Brother Scams You,"Works great. Very functional. BUT - get ready to go through all four cartridges every couple of weeks (with even a moderate use.) And the kicker is - even if you print just B&W, you have to have ALL FOUR cartridges in........what a racket!"
1,Awful,There are so many things that are wrong with this printer and it's incredibly flawed design that I won't even get into it. STAY FAR AWAY!
1,Stay away! Horrible software.,The printer itself is decent but the software included is very bloated and poor quality. The CD installs 150 MB worth of crapware programs on your PC. Then it barley even works. I cant print on my vista laptop but it can scan. It cant scan on xp but it can print. I would expect the CD to only install a driver but it also installs several program that run in the background.
1,MFC 240C,"I loathe and despise this printer. I mostly use the printer part of this machine for cardmaking and scrapbooking. I wasn't thinking when I bought this that I should have bought a machine that feeds paper from the back so it doesn't have to roll over to print. It hates cardstock and it takes several tries before I can get it to go through. I can't print on anything smaller than 8 1/2 x 11 because it won't feed and keeps jamming. I try taping the small piece to a larger piece but it just chews it up. Or it will pull several papers through at a time even though I've ""fanned"" them. I haven't figured out yet how to receive faxes and it won't collate multi page documents so the first page is on the top when you take them off the printer. This printer is only good for copying on paper of standard size and thickness."
5,Brother MFC-240C,AMAZING VALUE FOR THE MONEY. I USE THE FAX ALL THE TIME. I DON'T HAVE TO USE THE COMPUTER FOR THIS FUNCTION EITHER. I CAN SEND ONE PAGE OR AS MANY AS I LIKE. MUCH BETTER THAN MY OLD EPSON CX6400. I LOVE THIS MACHINE!
2,"Good printer, VERY expensive to maintain.","I've had this printer for about 6 weeks and have been happy with it's faxing and printing capabilities. However, when it runs out of ink, it doesn't seem possible to refill the cartridges as I have with most other printers so be prepared to shell out $60+ to replace all the ink carts. No generic carts are available for this one as of now.UPDATE: according to the comments, apparantly there are generic cartridges available now. When I originally wrote the review there weren't any. But I did figure out how to refill them (snap the cartridge in two at the seem, poke a needle into the clear plastic inside, fill with ink, tape over whole and tape up the cartridge)."
1,The worst printer I have ever seen,"Do not buy this printer. It is the worst printer I have ever seen. From the constant paper jams that are nearly impossible to unclog, false low ink readings that disable the printer, and just moodiness this printer is horrible. Some days it works, other days it decides to take a day off and will not function at all. The best are when you install a brand new ink cartridge and then it tells you that it is empty and refuses to attempt to print until you install yet another ink cartridge. I have never wanted to throw a piece of electronic equipment out the window until I met this printer."
1,Do not buy any printer made by Brother,"For the sake of your wallet and sanity ... Do not buy any printer made by Brother! I bought an inkjet multifunction that broke after about 24 months. It cost $90 to fix. Then it broke again ... the same problem, the infamous ""error 41"" ... four months later. I also bought a Brother laser printer. I installed a replacement toner cartridge, made by Brother, which was defective and leaked all over the inside of the machine, damaging the drum. Brother refused to cover the repair cost because they said the damage was caused by a ""consumable"" product - their defective toner cartridge! Another $110 to repair. In short, Brother products are junk, their warranty is bogus, and you'll waste a lot of money on repairing their garbage. I finally used my brain and bought a Lexmark, which I should have done in the first place because this brand has never caused me any problems."
1,WARNING: NEVER EVER BUY A BROTHER BRAND!,"IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING A PRINTER, BUY ANY BRAND BUT BROTHER! I BOUGHT THIS SUCKER OF A PRINTER ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO HOPING THAT I WILL SAVE MONEY BECAUSE OF ITS FEATURES. BOY, WAS I WRONG! THIS PRODUCT PROVED TO BE THE WORST TO EVER HIT THE MARKET. IT IS SLOWER THAN A TIRED TURTLE, IT WILL NOT WORK IF ANY ONE OF THE INK TANKS IS EMPTY [EVEN IF IT'S NOT FULLY EMPTY], AND IT SHOWS SOME WEIRD WARNINGS. IF YOU NEEDED TO PRINT RIGHT AWAY, YOU ARE OUT OF LUCK; THIS MACHINE TENDS TO TAKE ITS TIME AND YOU MUST HAVE THE PATIENCE OF A POPE, ELSE YOU CAN JUST SMASH IT. NO WONDER IT WAS SOLD AT ROCK-BOTTOM PRICE, IT'S A PIECE OF CRAP! BROTHER THINKS THAT BY SELLING THIS GARBAGE AT A VERY LOW PRICE WITH ALL THE FEATURES, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO CON THE BUYERS ONCE ITS INK REPLACEMENT TIME. INKS ARE EXPENSIVE AND DEPLETE LIKE CRAZY. ALL OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS STATED BEFORE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT ARE TRUE! DON'T TELL ME YOU WERE NOT WARNED!"
2,Don't Bother,"I bought a new printer specifically because I needed to print hundreds of business cards. The 240C was on sale for $60 at Best Buy and looked great from the product description. But when I set it up I couldn't print any business cards. The paper would either jam or it would print offside. I did some research on-line and found that this printer can't print business cards! What kind of printer is that!Also, upon putting it together I could really tell it was put together with cheap plastic. I returned it the next day."
3,Disapointed,"Disappointed----had trouble getting fax to work---poor customer & manual instructions---Brother replaced original new model with a refurbished one---still can't get fax to work. Slow time for command box to come up---poor availability of LC51 cartridges , OEM or compatibles.Copy works good, haven't tried scanner"
2,Ink Hog,"I have 2 printers at home. One is a monochrome laser printer which is my main printer for day to day printing. The second one is this for my scanning, copying , faxing and color printing needs. I rarely use this for printing (I think I've probably printed 5-10 pages on average a month)and yet it seems like the ink is always empty. It seems that the printer always runs out of ink even when not in use maybe because it always calibrates the ink heads. The only reason I haven't replaced this thing is the scan and fax features are ok. Once I have enough funds I think this printer needs to go."
2,Compatible ink is not 100% usable,"The printer seems Ok. However when I replaced the ink with a compatible one the second time. It didn't work. I tried another one, it didn't work either."
2,Poor fax and does not RECIEVE!,"AFTER you buy it, the documentation reveals that you can NOT receive faxes. And the outgoing faxmodem is only 14.4. Why would they do that? Bait & switch! Brother wants you to move up the next model. Too late.The software does not log the faxes you sent.Someone wrote you cannot scan multiple documents into one .pdf. I had no problem with that. Best feature is scanning multiple documents into a .pdf and attaching to your default email. They do not use an Outlook dialogue box like most programs, they just pop a ready-to-go email on your desktop. Nice.Regular printing takes forever to start."
1,"All-in-One Junk, Are you in??","Have this model for quite some time, and this machine is good for one thing and one thing only- it will rob every penny you have until you get rid of this junk. It has absolutely no VALUE!!! First of all, all the ink cartridges keep running out without even using it. I can understand if the inks ran out for considerable amount of usage, and the money spent on replacing those cartridge can be justified somehow. But that's not the case. It keeps giving errors to replace cartridges every now and then. This is absolutely ridiculous and unheard of! I would never buy brother's product again."
4,This book is uplifting without being Pollyannaish.,"I found the Art of Resilience a worthwhile read, particularly for someone dealing with grief or loss of some type. The format would appeal to one who suffers as it is organized into brief chapters containing vignettes, philosophy, or advice. It is not a long, heavy read of how you SHOULD feel, but rather an uplifting look at how you could choose to confront an illness, a death, or just one of the many setbacks that we are all destined to encounter on the journey of life. It would be a wonderful gift to place into the hands of a friend in need."
5,This book will give you tools that will last a lifetime.,"""The Art of Resilience"" will be one of my top 10 recommendations for my friends. Everyone can benefit from the wisdom in this book and use the tools provided throughout their entire life. Life naturally has its ups and downs and this book has helped me to relax and go with the flow more easily."
5,incredibly versatile and forgiving art medium,"Scratch, lift, erase, reuse, draw, paint-- you can do just about anything with the professional quality clay board. Claybord is essentially a sturdy hard board covered with smooth white kaolin clay.Some use this as a drawing surface, others paint on Claybord. My favorite use is converting Claybords into scratchboards.Claybord's mineral-coated, pH neutral surface is advertised as accepting any media from pencil to oils, and it has worked great with all the media I have applied to it. The advantage of the clay is that you can gently ""scratch"" to remove any pigment you have applied pigment exposing the white surface-- in this way, you can utilize the clay to create highlights, shading, texture, and depth.Easy to use, highly recommended. Lots of sizes are available (price increases with size, of course).You may also be interested in Claybord 9""x12"" Textured,Clayboard Black 8x10or theClaybord Ink Set."
4,IF YOUR THINKING OF TRYING,"FYI. I love these nipples, the milk only comes out when baby is sucking. Anyone who wants to try but is afraid of investing here is a trick: the nipples fit into the Advent bottles! We had a lot of Advent bottles given to us by friends, but I really didnt like them, so I bought one Second Nature bottle to try and I loved it, not wanting to waste the bottles I already had, I tried the nipple in the Advent bottle and it worked, no leaks either!! Just wanted to share"
2,nipples don't last,This system worked great at first but then the nipples cracked after 6weeks. I have replaced all the nipples with a different brand.
1,Confusing Nipple,"I tried this bottle with my 7 week old, the first couple of times he didn't really know what it was, but eventually got latched on, but then after 2 days he refused to take it. The nipple is shaped really weird and he doesn't understand that it is actually a bottle. I really liked the concept of the design itself, but the actual nipple is not good."
4,Great Stuff for When It was Recorded,I've been a fan a Paul Butterfield for a long time and didn't have anything on DVD. This performance is very good I think with a real live sound representing the era when it was filmed. I feel it's surprisingly good considering it was filmed over 30 years ago. My only complaint is that the last track on the DVD locks up about half way through and does not track correctly. (both of the Rockpalast DVD's that I have received (This one & Spirit) do the same thing) On this DVD it was the interview portion so none of the music was messed up.
5,A definite must read,"This is a wonderful resource for information on what it is like inside the Deaf community. Well written, informative, and a joy to read."
2,SORRRRRY,"Leah Hager Cohen's ""Train Go Sorry"" recounts childhood stories told from a hearing child's perspective growing up within a residential school for the Deaf, but somehow loses it punch after the first 20-30 pages. The bulk of ""TGS""s text is filled with the author's empathetic feelings for her peers, but seems to miss the point that is so vividly made within the book's title. In American Sign Language, the signs ""Train"" + ""Go"" + ""Sorry"" translates best to English as, ""Missing the boat"", and by my own account, the author makes reference to this (play on words/signs) on just a few occasions. TGS provides interesting insight into the relationship between the American hearing and Deaf communities, but lacks the continuity from chapter to chapter to be considered a decent read, by my standards. Pick this one up if you're interested in learning more about the Deaf culture, and how its members prepare themselves for life in the hearing world."
1,The Worst Book Ever Written,"I personally hated this book and wish it was never written. I am an American Sign Language student and usually find reading about deaf culture to be interesting, but this book was horrible. The plot jumped around too much and I found it to be incredibly boring. Save your time, don't read it."
3,Not bad...,"Train go sorry is a story told by Leah Cohen about the Lexington School for the Deaf in New York City. This book delves into the Cohen family history and the dynamic between a hearing father and his deaf parents, and the relationship between the hearing daughter, Leah and her father who is overly involved in the Lexington School for the Deaf. The book explores the history of the school as well as touching on Deaf culture, American Sign Language, and controversial topics such as cochlear implantation.This book introduces you to some integral students with complex stories to be told. We will follow these students throughout their time at Lexington. Getting to know these student and the difficulties they persevere through was my favorite portion of the book.I occasionally became frustrated by the skipping around of chapters and the complete digression some of the chapters take from the book's intentions. Needless to say I enjoyed the book, and it is a nice quick summer read."
3,Meh,"As a Bob and Tom listener on the radio, this was not the best of their comedians (except for Greg Warren-but still dated and over done. Think Fluteman Greg). I had seen this years ago and should have let it as a good memory."
4,WSJ Weekend - just enough news and entertainment!,"My husband was so happy to receive this as a gift. It arrived all year to our driveway, except for twice when it went to a neighbor by accident. One call to the local delivery company and it was correctec. The weekend edition is just enough WSJ to keep us happy without spending the much larger amount for the 6 day delivery!"
1,extremely upset,"I erred in ordering, thought it included Friday, which was the only day I really wanted it. (love the xword puzzle)When I called to cancel both subscriptions, it took over 45 minutes to explain and get then cancelled. After all that,my friend, Danya Pelzman is still getting hers, the agent only cancelled my subscription. I am so fed up I couldscream. Very busy at office and home, have not had time for another 45 minute chat to get the other cancelled again!Mrs. Pat Stanley"
5,Subscription,"The WSJ weekend edition is an excellent newspaper. I do have two complaints concerning delivery: I have not yet received my subsciption for 11/19/2011 and 11/26/2011. The two pior weeks, the papers delivered were unbagged.Thank you."
5,Best newspaper out there!,This is the only newspaper that my husband feels is worth reading. He waits to have his coffee every morning and enjoy the paper.
1,super disapponted,"As a long time subscriber to WSJ who had lapsed on subscription the past few years, I wanted to get the weekend edition ( super interesting content, not too much to read in a busy week).Placed the order and 2 weeks later was informed- the weekend edition is not available in Hawai'i.So disappointing."
1,What customer service????,"I renewed my WSJ subscription through Amazon because it saved me over $125 per year. ($249 vs. $376.) Amazon states that you can renew through their service, as well as buy new subscriptions. But it has been a major headache. I started receiving 2 issues. When I called WSJ, they said that you cannot renew through Amazon, that this has to be handled as a 2nd subscription. All they could do is put my first subscription on hold for 12 months until my new subscription runs out. Then restart my first subscription for the 2 months that remain on it. WSJ is inflexible and acts like they don't have anything to do with the subscriptions purchased through Amazon. I would advise anyone else purchasing a renewal to Wall Street Journal through Amazon to wait until you have about 3 weeks left on your subscription before renewing. You may end up missing a few issues before your new subsciption kicks in, but that is better than trying to deal with WSJ's customer service dept."
2,Some problems with this paper,"There are some interesting and well written articles. Lots of those cater to pretty high brow and affluent audience. Some of this resembles ""The Economist"" magazine content. Very upsetting that there have have been lots of problems with delivery of this paper."
1,Another Disapointed Long Time Subscriber,"I've been a loyal WSJ subscriber for many years and have found it to be well worth the subscription price. Since the Murdoch purchase, however, quality of the content has degraded, with many more fashion and fluff pieces. The new auto-renewal subscription tactics are not consumer friendly, to say the least. Now they are increasing my subscription fees about 200 percent. Sadly, I am cancelling my subscription and will be looking for a substitute news source."
2,"go for CDs, not SD card","There is no doubt that Pimsleur language programs are excellent. Pimsleur Spanish is also wonderful and I love it.However, this audiofy chip is very bad. The biggest problem is that you cannot use it on MP3 players or iPod. It is designed so that you cannot transfer the files onto MP3 players, so you have to use it on SDcard-capable pocket PCs or your computers. I should have bought the program in regular CDs because it would have been possible to listen to them on my iPod as well as transfer the program onto SD or CF card.The other problem is that this audiofy program is awkward when I need to find the exact part of lesson I want to listen to again. It is very hard to manipulate compared to regular CD or MP3 players.Therefore, I highly recommend you stay away from Aufiofy versions of Pimsleur. Instead, go for regular CDs even though it may take up some space and you may need 30minutes to transfer the program to your mp3 players or SD/CF card."
2,not really quality,"the battery or something hits in a way that it constantly runs. You have to take the battery out to store. Battery is a special hearing aid battery, I think. A little expensive for such a cheaply made product.That being said, it runs well!"
1,do not buy,"I looked at the picture and said to my self, that is a heavy duty cover, NOT- it is just a heavy trash bag, it does fit ok. $15 was wasted and that was on sale.. I am not going to sent it back, to much gas."
1,should be called an un-cover,"i thought it was me, maybe i put the cover on wrong. i was mistaken this thing should be called the un-coverbecause thats what you get. i can't even imagine who designed this. i wish i had read the other reviews."
1,Lousy cover. Not at all what is described. Disappointing,"Don't waste your money on this thing. There is no draw-string at the bottom of the cover for a tight fit and there are 2 gaping holes at the top corners of the cover that will allow everything that you don't want into it. I wish I had read some of these reviews before purchasing. Shame on me, so learn from my mistake. You'd be better off throwing a sheet of plastic over your generator. This cover is junk!!"
3,Too small for Porter Cable H1000,"This cover was listed on the same page as the Porter Cable H1000, 10kW generator. It is too small for that generator. Get the extra large instead."
1,Piece of junk,This cover should be sold at a Dollar Store. The material is light. A garbage bag would work better. It has not way to secure it to the generator and would immediately blow off. I returned it promptly for a refund
2,Cover is smaller than specified.,The medium size generator cover is actually smaller than the 25-by-19-by-21-inches(LxWxH)shown in the description. The dimensions on the product box are 24-by-16.5-by-16 (LxWxH) which is considerably smaller. Be careful.
4,Not exactly as shown in picture,Cover is of good quality but is not as shown in the picture. The cover I received is of a lighter weight material than the one shown in the picture and does not have the logo on the front. It does have an accessories bag attached to the side which is handy for storing the manual and tool kit that came with the generator.
1,Light and cheap,"This item is not good, is about 10 inches off the ground and allows dust to blow under and up into the generator, also blows off with a little gust, as there is no way to secure to generator. I have a standard size generator."
3,Beware Not As Described and Pictured,"I just received the item. I don't know what this material is called, but very cheap platic-like material and paper light. Picture seems to show cloth-like material and heavy. No logo as shown. Only warning label. No elastic or rope at the bottom. The cover just hangs loose. The good thing is that this size fits fine. I store my generator under my patio cover so I only needed a dust cover so this will work fine. I would not use this outdoor with no sun or rain protection because this would not work, I think. Really good for dust cover ONLY. Gave 3 stars becuse it fits my generator and does what I wanted - keep dust away. Otherwise it will get only one star for cheap quality and not as shown on the pitcture. Buyer - beware!"
1,Product not as advertised,"I was surprised that the the cover that arrived did not match the product description. I've ordered numerous items from Amazon and had good success in the past. Unfortunately this order is a bust. There is no 'Elastic shock cord in bottom hem' to 'provide [a] slip-on, custom-like fit'. Basically it is a 5 sided plastic cube, open at the bottom, that drapes over the generator. I'd ordered this specifically for the cord in the hem to keep it in place in windy weather. Also, one corner is open and fastens with velcro. This was also not described in the product information. I'm concerned that rain will get in thru this opening, which defeats the purpose of a cover.In all I wouldn't recommend this product as a generator cover. I'm more disappointed however by the misleading product description."
3,Serves the purpose..... mostly.,"The cover seems to be adequately constructed. My generator stays outside, so I needed a cover that would protect it from the elements. This cover does that for the most part, but the cutouts for the generator's handles allow rain to enter. While I don't think this will be a major problem, it would be better to have a cover that completely covers the generator. The cover also has no mechanism to keep it in place during high winds. The first big wind we had blew the cover off. Also, the small bag that's attached collects water which pulls that side of the cover down making it even more likely to be blown off. I secured a bungee cord around the bottom of the cover which helps keep it in place, and I plan to cut the bag off since it serves no apparent purpose (for me, anyway). All in all, for the price, I think this cover will do OK. Maybe if and when it needs replaced I'll spring for a better cover."
1,Not as advertised,"The description for this cover states: ""Elastic shock cord in bottom hem provides slip-on, custom-like fit."" The cover does NOT have any type of cord, drawstring, or other fasteners on the bottom to make it more secure on the generator. I have a Generac 8000 (pro series), and the cover was way too loose. In addition, the ""heavy-duty fabric"" is actually a very thin nylon with no type of coating to keep the elements away from the generator. Any wind more than a light breeze is simply going to rip this lightweight, loose-fitting cover off the generator. An additional note: the cover I received was NOT branded with the CLASSIC logo anywhere, as shown in the photo."
4,Does the job,"Bought this for my 10KW Generac portable generator, and it does the job. Covers the engine and generator, and if you're patient, you can even leave the handles exposed through the corner slits in the cover. Seems adequately strong with well-sewn seams - should last a long time, and it'll keep my generator warm and dry over the winter.Definitely recommended for any large portable generator."
2,Too small?,"The cover was too small for the generator (the picture on the web page gives you a wrong impression and is missleading). Even though, it was a recommended item to be purchased along with the generator. Although, the cover was well made, it should have been made using heavier fabric for real world applications."
3,How to cover your generator in 1 easy step.,"Do you live in a hurricane prone area?Have you, for any reason, lost electricity for more than a week?If you answer yes to either question you need to own a generator and if you buy a generator, which is an ugly peice of machinery, you need to hide it with an appropriate cover.Go to Amazon.com and you will find a very good cover at a reasonable price. The cover will protect your ugly machine and appear to be covering your barbeque grill which should impress your neighbors."
2,poor quality,"the cover for the generator is not good in bad weather there is no way to secure over the generator so that wind will not lift it off and let it blow away, also moisture (rain and snow) can get onto the generator through holes in the cover."
3,Not as described,"Item description stated elastic shock cord at bottom of cover, which is incorrect. There is no elastic. Also, the picture appears to be of a heavy duty cover, but it is extremely light weight. It did fit my generator well. I think an inexpensive barbecue grill cover would work better and cost less."
1,not as described,"Description states elastic bottom but info that came w/cover states only on the medium. Description doesen't mention there are 2 large holes for handles to stick out, hard to be water tite that way. 1 side opens w/velcro that doesen't cover the entire length, again, hard to be water tite that way. Thin and cheap, imho.hard to find a good cover.jm"
3,It just A Cover,It's just a cover not to keep the rain and snow off just the dust off the machine. And it doesn't tie down to the generator.
2,Not quite what I expected.,"This generator cover is a good example of the problems associated with buying on line, if I had examined the cover in a store prior to buying it I would not have bought it. It does cover my 7,000 watt generator but it is made of very thin material and I could have as much protection for my generator by covering it with an old sheet. It has holes for the handle but they are not in the correct place to be used with my handle. With the shipping cost it's just not worth sending it back. Maybe someone else will benefit from my experience."
4,Its a cover!!!,Fits the champion 41135 generator just fine and seems like its good quality and will last through weather and storms.
2,Flimsy. Awkwardly designed,"I ordered this cover to try to save some money and this is truly a case of ""you get what you pay for"". It is very flimsy, unlike the photo. The holes are awkwardly positioned close to the top, which is important to me. With the way the holes are positioned, I am forced to run chains to the generator loosely, allowing slack where I prefer to keep the chains tight to the fence where generator is chained to in order to allow no slack for would be thiefs to have room to cut the chains. The generator is also packed in a bag (which interestingly enough has a drawstring where the cover does not.) That bag is permanently attached to the cover unless you cut it off. There is also no way to tighten the cover around the base of the generator. Very poorly made product. I should've worried less about price and more about protecting my investment."
4,Solid Product,This is a great product. Not super special but then again it isn't super cheap that it just falls apart. This includes a bag (attached to product).
4,Generator cover,It works. Not much else to say about it. Just make sure it's big enough for your unit. Could be a little thicker.
4,Generator cover,"While I would never leave the generator out in the weather with a cover this thin, it definitely suited what I wanted. I keep the generator in the garage and cover it and it is definitely better than nothing at all."
4,Covers my Briggs and Stratton storm responder,fairly pricedcovers my 5500 watt generatordoes the jobI would have rated it a little higher if the material was heavier....no regrets for the price
3,"Good for indoor storage, but not outdoor","Fits fine, and is good for internal storage. However, there is no elastic on the bottom as described. Strong wind will pull the cover off."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,THE COVER IS NOT THE RIGHT SIZE FOR THE GENERATOR WE GOT. THE COVER WAS SHOWN ON OUR GENERATOR AND THE CORRECT ONE WAS SUPPOSEDLY DISPLAYED AND ORDERED. IT IS TO LARGE AND WILL NOT TIGHTEN UP TO MAKE A GOOD FIT. VERY DISAPPOINTED AND WISH I WOULD HAVE SENT IT BACK. IT IS USELESS AS IT IS.
1,bad item,Item billed and described as XL box label said medium. Complete garbage. Did find other use but still need a cover for generator. Atleast I know aha I'm not using.
1,Gen Cover,You get what u pay for....very cheap flimsy cover...Must be used for inside use if any use @ allit might protect from dust but that too could probably blow a hole in it...lolJust buy a tarp its cheaper and will do a better job or a bbq grill cover that is thick and will fit your generatorFYI the Honda generator covers while $50 are worth the $$$ if they will fit your Gen
1,Don't waste your money,"Cheap material, might be call ""large"" but is not that large at all. I wouldn't cover my kids toys with it outside never mind my generator!"
1,Flimsy generator cover,"The cover is very flimsy and lightweight, not at all what I expected. It blew off in the wind and won't stay in place no matter how many times I replace it. The last time it blew off it rained so there was a puddle of water on top of the generator. From the photo it looks like a heavyweight, almost rubber cover, but it isn't."
5,Works well,Purchased to use as a dust cover for my son's 110cc import ATV/Quad bike. It does fit quite well despite not being made for it and certainly keeps the dust and any other heavy particles off it when not in use.
2,A bit too big,I thought the cover would be the proper size for my generator. It was obviously designed for a larger one. There are also slits in it which make it difficult to keep the rain out.
2,Sized Wrong,Based on the dimensions listed in the ad the medium size cover would have been prefect but the size was larger than actual and larger than the size lised on the product when it arrived. It had to be sent back.
5,Perfect. It's what i needed.,"Since the generator is garage kept most times and i needed a cover, and this one is perfect."
2,gen. cover,"Cheap, lightweight cover. Disappointed in quality but just purchased, so I can't comment on durability."
5,Great Cover,"I searched HIGH and LOW to find this item.. No one carried the size I needed to cover my 15KW Generator. I should have known better and went straight to [...]... The product quality is superb, and it fits my generator perfectly.... Ordering was easy, and it was shipped promptly.. Next time I need something, I'm shopping at Amazon FIRST !!!!!"
1,Item not as described,It does not have a elastic cord at the bottom. There is nothing to hold it on the generator. I returned it.
2,Not very substantial,"The cover fits like a glove, and if I planned to store my generator inside until it was needed, it would be perfect. However, for very practical reasons, the generator will be on my deck (bolted down, for sure) and exposed to Maine weather. The cover is very light - much lighter than an ordinary grill cover - and I worry that it will not stand up to the elements. Right now I'm contemplating whether I might need a cover to cover the cover."
2,Not worth the money,Its is very flimsy. It doesn't stay on the generator at all. There is nothin to help secure it onto the generator. I don't think that it's going to last long at all.
2,mfn,there's no draw string at the bottom. it's practically useless without it. material is thin. not worth the price. do not buy this product.
2,This is heavy nylon? Where's the shock cord?,"The product I received was a woeful disappointment. There is no shock cord in the bottom edge and there are 12"" seam openings in two corners (to allow for handles is my assumption,) but I bought this to keep rain and debris off the unit. Rain and snow would have no problem building inside the cover and a good stiff wind would likely remove it from the generator. It does at least provide a layer underneath the tarp I have tied down over it. The ""heavy-duty"" fabric is the weight of a light windbreaker. I do not recommend this product."
1,Classic Accessories Generator Cover,"This product is of inferior construction, flimsy & thin & although it ddoes fit my generator, it blows off at every chance it gets. I expect, because of the quality, that it will be torn to shreds within a month."
1,Wrong size,Large cover should be 35-by-24-by-30 but actually it is 35-by-24-by-21! And it is too short for my 7000W generator. Be careful
3,Flimsy but works..,The cover is thin and not as durable as it looks in the photo or as described 'heavy duty'. There are two holes for the handles if your generator has one. Not totally comfortable putting the generator outside or even covered shed. Better to leave it in closed shed.
3,Ample size... but very thin,Although the generator cover was of ample size to fit my Generac GP7500E... I felt the cover was very thin and probably wouldn't last. It's good for keeping dirt and dust off the unit from a garage or shed storage location.
3,It's okay...,"The material is a little on the thin side, but about what I expected for the price. It does its job of keeping the water away. However, the wind is another story. I frequently have to track down the cover if the wind does pick up as it is able to lift off the generator (even with the velcro attached around the handles). It would be nice to have an elastic band around the bottom as in the smaller sizes as I think that would do the trick. If you encounter wind (especially during a rain storm), be prepared to place something on top to weigh the cover down or secure the cover to the generator frame using clips/bungee cords/etc..."
4,good value for the money,"Material is great for a dust cover.The wind blew the cover off, I wishit had ties to secure it"
5,Used as covers for shop machines - work well and seem durable,"I purchased several of these to use as dust covers for shop machinery mounted on rolling stands or workbench (lunchbox planer, small jointer,scroll saw, bench belt sander). They work well. The covers have held up well as I have taken them off and put them back on many, many times. I am careful while removing the covers, but I wouldn't have been stunned if one of the four had developed a tear by now - none have."
4,GENERATOR COVER 79537,COVER IS GREAT BUT IT WAS A LITTLE TOO SMAL FOR MY GENERATOR I SHOULD HAVE ORDER THE EXTRA LARGE.
2,Not what I expected,"Not big enough screws, box was ripped along with the directions! Not enough suction cups. I would not recommend this item to anyone!"
4,Love it!!!!,"I have to say I absolutely LOVE this product. When it first arrived I was excited to open it. It came exactly on time! It was a little difficult to put together since my instructions were tore in 4 pieces. That's the only reason why I gave it a four star. Other than that- t's an wonderful addition, and easy to clean. LOVE IT!!!!"
4,WONDERFUL !,"A beautiful vanity, very nice size and everything. One thing to know though is lighting. You will need either a really bright room or some additional lighting to actually do your makeup at the vanity. But it is SO beautiful and SO worth it."
2,"great price, but broken glass","The shipping and hanlding was the same amount so there was no poiunt in sending it backl or I would have been paying for it twice., I saw that others had similar issues but thought ""nah, that wont happen to me. "" Well I was wrong. The vanity is actually adorable if it had made it in one piece. Thank goodness it was for my teenage daughter, so we glued the mirror back where it broke, and are planning to put a sticker of her choice over the cracks. The seat was sturdy and nice. Too bad about the shipping handling becuase I would have raved about the price otherwise. Definaltely wont do it agian though."
4,A great Christmas present,"I really like this vanity. The only problem I had was that the decorative knobs in the back bent very easily. It was shipped very quickly, and was easy to put together."
1,Poor quality,"I bought this for my daughter, it was nice to look at but not well built. My husband was putting it together, and all the holes for the bolts on the seat were stripped out. I wouldn't reccomend this product. Not to mention it seems like a good deal at $45 but then doubles when u check out with shipping being at $41.NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR AGGRAVATION!"
3,not the best,"This product is obviously made out of metal, which is great but there was a problem assembling it: (some of the pre-drilled holes for the screws would not exactly line up). Result, the table isn't a perfect shape/rectangle. Once placing the rectangular glass panel on top it is obvious. IT WILL NEVER LINE UP. Evidently the manufacturing of this product is less than perfect. My husband and I tried 3x to get it right ,but the holes just wouldn't line up to create the correct angles. I will use this product for now ,but its so heavy there's no way I'm packing it back up and returning. I'm not going through the hassle. You get what you pay for. Later I might post a picture of this flaw to illustrate exactly what I mean. Other than that, if you luck out and get a good one you will love it."
2,Indeterminate,"I was happy with the appearance and size of the vanity set. It also is very easy to figure out how to assemble it, however, not all of the pieces fit together properly, and the vanity is therefor a bit wobbly. Overall it's a nice set, but the manufactures should pay a bit more attention to the sizing of the pieces."
3,Decent,"It is a nice vanity, but the parts didn't fit together perfectly so now both the mirror and the table itself are crooked. Also, the decorative balls on both sides were chipped and scratched a lot. Not great but it'll work. Too lazy to take apart and return."
1,Charger Faulty,"I received the charger and batteries very quickly however, the charger would not charge the batteries. Based on what I have already read, there is obviously something wrong with the manufacturing of the product. My suggestion would be to try another make/model."
1,Don't buy this product,"When I ordered this product, I received it in a timely manner, but the charger was faulty. I contacted the seller and they sent a new charger and batteries free of charge and did not ask for the faulty charger back. The new item did work, however the batteries only last in my digital camera for approximately 1 hour. Even when I turn the camera off, the batteries will not work the next day. I was forced to purchase a different item from a different seller at a much higher cost in order to have rechargeable batteries that lasted for more than 10-15 camera shots. The seller would not refund the purchase or take the product back. I have not bought any other items from the seller, so I do not know if their other products are better than what I purchased from them, but I was bit once, so I would rather not try again."
1,NOT 60-min,"This product is not what it is supposed to be. First one I got took over 2 hours to fully charge, so I returned it for a replacement. Second one took 3 1/2+ hours for initial charge, 2 1/2+ hours next time. Returning it, too. Amazon has great customer service."
2,"Abridged: 5-star material, 2-star CD set","At one point in the first season/series Ricky talks about the entire season being on the CD release. Maybe there is such an edition, but this isn't it and I couldn't find such an edition. I think you can still get the full first season at Audible. I would recommend that over this."
1,Didn't like,Hard to read. Electro-luminescent with afterglow barely lights up. Cheap feel to watch. I ended up returning.
1,Terrible Quality,Typical Chinese style product. Great price and terrible quality. The digital display might as well not exist because its too dark to read at any point. You can sorta read it when you press the light button but even then you have to squint. Band is cheap as well. Don't waste your money or your time.
4,Anatomy of a murder hits close to home,"This movie was filmed in the town and surrounding areas in which I live, In fact in the scene with the children playing, My mother was one of the children. It is interesting to see the places in the film as they were in the movie compared to how they are today."
1,Be Carefuil,"Be careful. This is a digital item that one must download to view. I thought it was a DVD and ordered it. Now Amazon has no way to cancel or return this item so I'm just out $9.99. I should have looked closer but am so used to ordering DVDs that I didn't notice. Also, in the past Amazon's cancel or return features have been friendly and effective. On this digital item they are non-existent."
3,"this is the one that ISNT ""witness for the prosecution""","my overwelming memory of having just watched this is just how damned looooooong this movie is. a courtroom drama that extends to nearly three hours better be taut as seltzer, and this just lollygags way too much. while james stewart is usually one of my favorite actors, he is permitted way too much hemming & hawing here by the always pedestrian director otto preminger. strong support from youngsters ben gazzara and lee remick, and a fine duke ellington score (tho it seems to get lost half-way thru). worth watching, but it wouldve been alot better with 20 minutes slashed."
1,WRONG ASPECT RATIO!!!,"The USA DVD has been panned and scanned to approximately 1.33:1 from what IMDb says is an original aspect ratio of 1.85:1. Although the German PAL version claims to have the correct aspect ratio, customers on German Amazon have complained that it has been chopped to 1.33:1 there, too, despite what is stated on the packaging and on the Amazon Web site. The only version which seems to be close to authentic is the British PAL version at 1.78:1, available through Amazon.co.uk."
2,You'll never look at white panties with ruffles the same way,"This was a really strange movie and very long. If you don't like courtroom scenes, steer clear of this film, because it is basically one long courtroom scene. I have to admit it really was handled quite brilliantly, and I give credit to the scriptwriter and the actors who were the lawyers for the fact that it didn't quite put me to sleep. I was amazed that in 1959, the situation about assault, rape, and ripped white panties with ruffles was so freely talked about. I guess the code must have been on its way out even then.James Stewart was really the best thing about the movie but even he couldn't make it a wonder. The guy who played Pa Kwimper in ""Follow That Dream"" was the sidekick and helped a bit with the case.I can't say I highly recommend this movie unless you're a diehard fan of James Stewart or courtrooms."
2,Dated and Overrated,"Anatomy of a Murder is an interesting period piece, however I was stunned to learn that the period in question was 1959. The sexist attitudes in the film literally made me feel ill. The most stunning moment is when the entire courtroom brakes into full-throated laughter at the mention of the ""panties"" that are missing evidence in the alleged rape.This movie does not stand the test of time. It seems like an overly long endorsement of those ancient falsehoods that good women don't get raped and bad women lie about it. Beyond that, the courtroom antics are a bit over the top and the judge unbelievabley lenient about it all."
2,About One Hour Too Long,"Well-acted (but almost THREE hour) drama about a attorney who takes the case of man who has killed his wife's rapist. Or was she really raped? Or did the husband really not remember the circumstances surrounding the shooting? Or did it matter? The writing was too much over the top with Jimmy Stewart and George C. Scott trading barbs over what would be allowed in the trial....The part at the end about Mary the hostess was pretty darn unlikely to say the least, so only two stars for the huge insult to viewer's intelligence."
3,jimmy gimmie,"Pretty good little, no good, doggedy dogg, ""who's the man now dog"", movie. Great performances all around. I thought Ben Gazarra was great. And so young. And Lee Remick, the girl, whoa. She was a looker. Of course George C. Scott and Stewart were great too. Although I thought Stewart did a little too much dramatics.The only bad thing about this movie was that I don't think the ending lived up to the great beginning. I thought it was just a great intro, with great little moments that I so miss in modern movies. And I was a little confused about the courtroom specifics, which are kind of a big deal being that this is basically a courtroom drama. And it's not a bad courtroom drama, just sort of typical.But great beginnng and good dialouge throughout. I think you'll like this more than me Rino. I think it's your kind of old movie.But I give it a B-"
4,courtroom drama does not fail to hold you,"although close to 3 hours long, anatomy of a murder holds your attention. long a fan of good courtroom dramas (caine mutiny, e.g.), this film did not fail to hold my attention. jimmy stewart is superb as the wily defense attorney and the judge (apparently real!) is humorous and keeps things in perspective. i recommend this film for anyone who appreciates good courtroom drama."
5,Primer on witness tampering by lawywers,Jimmie Stewart's violation of the ethics code is both charming and alarming.
4,The Real Star: Duke Ellington,"When I watch this movie, I must confess that I am being distracted by the music. The late, great musicologist Martin Williams one remarked that it's a bad score, as it takes away one's attention from the story. Fortunately, the music score is available in (almost) its entirety. Composed and arranged by Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, you can listen to it on Columbia/Legacy CK 65569, [....] I think the music will still be listened to in 50 years, when the story, the movie will be forgotten. But ... you can see the Duke in the movie, and listen to him while Jimmy Stewart 'plays' the piano ... That's why ""d give 4 stars to this DVD.Loek Hopstaken"
2,Amazon.com is again DISHONEST in its ad for this DVD,"Anatomy of a Murder is a fine movie. Too bad it is not presented on DVD in its original widescreen aspect ratio. But you won't know that by looking at Amazon's ads for it...no where can you find this is a Full Screen edition. In fact, you can bet that Amazon now never informs the public that new DVDs are in Full Screen.The 2 stars are for the Full Screen, not the film itself."
1,Snoozefest,"This movie is a 2 hour and 40 minute snoozefest. After reading the other reviews here, the only conclusion that I can come to is they must have reduced the price of crack.I literally kept falling asleep while watching this, and my wife kept waking me up. We wanted to shut it off but we'd invested so much time into it already, we felt that we had to sit through it to the end.There is one of those rare films that has no redeeming qualities. No, there was one. I got to see Orson Bean, who used to be on To Tell the Truth, in a movie role."
4,Sibling ribaldry,"I'd never read Dunmore before. This novel is a psychological thriller with some nice poetic passages. It explores a mystery from two sisters' childhood and the relationship of the two women as adults. The narrative moves along rapidly, and the author's use of language is at times exquisite. There are also some notably frank sexual passages. The denouement didn't blow me away quite as much as I thought it would."
3,"Interesting, but that's about it, unfortunately.","I think that the author is very talented, but the book never clicked for me. I never made a true connection to the characters and the story seemed a little ""rushed"" (the book IS very small). The sex scenes between Nina and her brother-in-law were a little too frequent and a little over the edge for me, but I realize different readers have different tastes. I LOVED the author's style of writing and it was very visual, but the book is definitely not a ""re-read"" for me, nor would I recommend it to anyone. I think the author has great potential and the people who really enjoyed this book would probably also love any books by Alice Hoffman (check site for reviews). I like Alice Hoffman's prose as well, but she does a much better job with her storylines. I'll admit that the ending was pretty darned good in that I had to go back and reread the previous page just to make sure I got it right. :) Best wishes to Ms. Dunmore!"
4,I wish I could have read this book more slowly.,"This book was so wonderfully written, yet so involving that when I finished it (in two days) I wished I had been able to read it more slowly and savor all of the descriptions. I was taken in and surprised by twists and turns in the plot and I had a hard time deciding which characters I liked and which I didn't. And my opinions changed often during the reading! I would highly recommend this book--it would be a great book group read that would likely provide a great deal of discussion."
1,Don't Bother,"Dunmore writes to impress and fails. I was surprised to find she'd won a prestigious award for a novel so transparent in its plot and characters. Her prose is laboriously and contrivedly clever, not a thing I admire. The only parts I found worth the time spent reading them were the descriptions of the garden and the flashbacks and dreams. Her take on sibling interactions seemed a realistic one to me, though the lengths to which she took them did not. In the end, it wasn't really worth the reading. If I hadn't bought the hardcover in a fit of extravagance one day, I would never have finished it."
1,Melodrama at its worst,"I am very surprised this book has garnered so much praise. The plot is predictable and thin, and the characters are not much better. Ms. Dunmore's writing is elegant, but Talking to the Dead is little more than a simplistic romance and mystery."
1,What did I miss?,"A group of Brits must have gotten together somewhere, knocked back a few gin and tonics and nominated Talking to the Dead for the Orange Prize. The judges who voted for it were already drunk. This has to be one of the most disappointing novels I've read in the last two years. It is a soap opera of lousy writing with an ending as predictable as it is awful. If you want to read a TERRIFIC book about the struggles between siblings, read BLUE River by the most talented Ethan Canin."
3,........,"This book is ok. Kind of a interesting book. I did this book for my book report and I got an A(I used Amazon.com's review).This book is not really good for kids under 13, it have sex scene in it and have a lot of swear."
5,Best series I have ever read!,The book is excelent! It has no filthy language. It centers around 2045 A.D. It is a book for all ages!....
3,Better than some,"An enjoyable, though slightly lightweight, adventure centering around a young man named Mok who, for some undescribable reason, is kidnapped and hooked to a macine that puts him into a netherworld, in which he must use his enjineuity to solve problems. Read this when you need to relax your brain."
2,"""La Otra"" Ummmm not good","This sopa is edited on a very bored way. All she thos is cry, cry, cry, and cry. Only thing that I enjoyed was the final episode. The final episode is the most interesting part of thi dvd. I fast foward a lot of episodes. The DVD duration is ""300"" minutes and I could say I saw in ""100"" minutes."
5,Well edited DVD. Great intro to telenovelas.,"If you've only watched American soaps, try a telenovela. This one has optional English subtitles. La Otra one may actually ruin you for other telenovelas because the standard is set so high. The acting, writing, and directing really came together on this one. Yadhira Carrillo excels in the dual role of Carlota and Cordelia. She and Juan Soler have that supercouple factor.If you watched this telenovela on TV, fear not. The music score is still intact. The Chopin and the cello and the violins are still in the right spots.Those new to La Otra may be surprised to know that although we follow several years in the lives of these characters, the program ran for only four months. There isn't time for any slow parts."
3,Too much editing,This is a telenovela that has a great plot with a wonderful exploration of a very tense mother-daughter relationship. The novela delves into the impact of emotional abuse and shows its long lasting effects. BUT this novela is cut down to a bare minimum especially towards the end where the editor leaves the viewer with lots of questions. The producers of telenovelas should really just release the videos with no editing or minimal editing since the magic of the telenovela is in the details and in the secondary plots. So great plot but as a DVD I do not recommend it highly. Try Azul Tequila which is uncut and fabulous. We need more telenovelas like Azul Tequila.
3,it is an o.k story,"the story is a little too sad all the way throught, the main character (female) cried too much for my taste. But I still like it, it wouldn't be one of my best."
4,A Great Telenovela!,"I buy and watch Mexican Telenovelas as a student of Spanish so I know them all. Though the story line is a bit chopped up in various places in ""La Otra"" from the editing process.... this is still a great novela with a great story and very interesting to watch with excellent acting. To top it off, this is one of the few novelas that has a soundtrack that actually doesn't suck. The music and sound track are very well done and not irritating like so many others. If you were going to have a collection of 5 telenovelas out of the hundreds that exist, this should be one of the five."
3,wonderful but poor dvd quality,"La Otra is a wonderful story if truly ""incredible"" in terms of its plot. As always, I wish that the story line were not so disconnected. This one does a pretty good job of telling the story although it's clear that so much is missing. My problem is that I had to send the DVD back because of damaged areas. The second one that replaced it was even worse. I wonder if it has something to do with the two-sided format that is used for these discs. Very frustrating."
5,Love This,"Anatomy is my favorite solo record by Stan next to ""The Big Heat"" from the 80's. The instrumentals are as soothing and fit-into the album as well as the other songs that paint stories with dry, humorous and dark, satirical comedy, that all blend-in together and to create a rolling mood and feel much like a pulp film, dark comedy or book that stands on its own.I don't think Stan's music was ever very good for pairing with video or film, but instead stood on its own and highlights the ability of a great songwriter to convey ideas and characters without the need for visual stimulation - which is what great music is all about ultimately.If you're just getting into Stan's music or seeking him out as a result of Wall Of Voodoo's popularity, this is a great early place to start, despite its release later in his career in 1999, as he slowly mellowed with time and age into the current era."
4,"yikes HE LIKES HIM TOO yuke, doc one star.","IF YOU LIKE YOUR SARCASTIC? , LIKE IN PLASTIC,AND you like to cry alot, and you like keyboards singer song writers and your sick of billy joel and you feel stuck in mind rot middle of the ROADISM, give ole stan a try, even though your an inteligent oblivous ERADITE WEASSELaka COLLEGE EDUCATED BORE LIKE,MY self, you like[ BOB DYLAN SEXPISTOLS] not NOT!

AS the plasmatic,STANS STORIES SOAR AS SOUR TOWERS in TUNESVILLE."
5,stan strikes again,"Generally more laid-back sounding than previous Stan releases, this one still packs a sonic punch. The writing is as clever as ever, and there are some very interesting instrumental tracks that evidently showcase Stan's mission to write and be included on soundtrack material. Several songs are kinda countrified, like Train of Thought, the re-make of Sixteen Tons, and Mama Had a Stove. But I absolutely love the rocker Susie Before Sunrise, with its thumping basslines and fuzz guitar. There's also a very hip-sounding Valerie is Sleeping, with excellent sound effects and percussion. This is definitely not mainstream pop, but it's friendly to my ears. Way to go, Stan!"
4,Suspenseful and absorbing,"My favorite kind of books are those that are suspenseful, absorbing and have a plot that is intricate. The Fires of Gehenna is one such book! It takes you on a trip inside the minds of the characters and doesn't leave you wanting for action! I think Mr. Vlachos is a first class writer, and can't wait until his next novel."
5,The pinnacle of unsophisticated cartoon humor,"What's better than Looney Toons and funnier than Rocko's Modern Life? Ren and Stimpy! This video may not be available, but try to watch Ren and Stimpy whenever you can! It is extremely funny in its own sick way!"
2,Good ideas but too short,"I was very excited about this book but was a little disappointed when I received it. It is only 81 pages and in total there are a scant 16 core activities that it suggests around the area as being ""dad friendly."" Unfortunately several of these ideas are seasonal so that leaves even less to do in the winter months. I wish it had been fully developed into something else, like including area hikes, stay at home activities and just plain more stuff."
4,it's an lm317t,"grabbed a couple of these for use as constant current sources, and they work like every other lm317t i've ever used."
5,Best One-Stop Guidebook for Northern California,"As a busy parent of three children, I am always on the look out for new weekend adventures--this book has it all. It gives great history, detail, local color, places and events...even usable local area maps.With listings by regions, Kim Weir has a succinct novelists eye for what makes Northern California beat. Makes great reading...I keep this large 1000 page pocket book at my nightstand to read colorful stories about places I might someday visit. Equally compact, I then load the book in my car for ready reference to see what's hot whereever we roam.Written with the insight of Mark Twain, this is an excellent source for anyone wanting to capture the diversity of Northern California at it's greatest. Lot's of fun. Quite readible. Full of nice pictures.Well worth the $ for the new 2000 edition. Congrats to Moon Press for another winner. Please keep those updates comming."
3,"Out of date listings, but good general info","In general I like the Moon Guides. I appreciate them for the practical, honest advice about attractions -- if it's a tourist trap, they'll tell it as it is. -- and the mix of both high- and low-end restaurants and hotels. However, this particular guide has become obsolete very quickly. I used it for my trip down the California coast this July. In general, the information about attractions was mostly valid (prices were off), but I found myself repeatedly driving to restaurants listed in the guide that had since closed. Two different restaurants in the Redwoods that the guide said would be serving dinner were closed or out of business. In the end, we had to keep driving the highway and looking at every exit for restaurants not listed in the guide. Our experiences all the way down the coast as far as Big Sur were similar. If you buy this guide, you'll have to supplement it with another book for the hotel and restaurant listings."
2,Nail polish,Normally love this product but apparently this one was old and would not adhere to nails. My nails stayed tacky.
5,I can't wait!,I just got their forever faithless cd album. it's the best man! can't wait for the vids to be out! =)
4,Adventures in time,"Brian Jacques heads off from Redwall and ventures into a new type of book. This fantasy story is about a boy and his dog who travel through time. It is a good old-fashioned adventure story, a battle between ""good"" and ""evil"", that keeps you turning the pages. I just felt that I would have liked to know more about Neb and Den's other adventures at other times in history, but maybe there will be sequels?"
4,A captivating philosophical fantasy,"While I didn't quite devour this book as fast as I may have some of Jacques' other books, I was nonetheless very impressed by it. In fact, I was much more impessed than I was with his Redwall books, not because it was more enjoyable but because it was more thought-provoking. The strange tale of the psychically-connected boy and dog moving through time allows readers to exercise their minds with philosopical and spiritual ideas. At the same time, the writing is very accessible. As these two qualities are not often found together, I highly recommend this book for readers who like a light read that still has some depth to it. The story also has an somewhat unique pace to it which I found very enjoyable. Overall, a great read!"
2,This book was boring.,"I thought this book was dull and it was hard to get through.Nothing ever happened to the book's characters after the storm, they always know the answers...i didnt enjoy this book much."
2,"It started off good, but then the plot slowly weakened......","At first the book was great. I was thrown into an exciting ride on the Flying Dutchman, filled with action, suspense, and intrigue. But the everything changed.Once the main characters (a boy named Neb and his friend dog Den)were actually ""cast off"" from the flying Dutchman, the book got a little silly.The author then plunged us into this other story where our heroes, now able to speak tele-kenetically in their minds to each other,arrive at a small English sea -side villiage where they must help their friends solve a mysterey to save the town.The story basically is flat, disappointing,and definitely lacking something and the characters are very poorly depicted and everything they say is extremely corny or devoid of true emotion and feeling.If I were you I would rather read the ""Redwall"" series. Those books, unlike this one, show that the author does have some talent."
1,THis book should deserve a --> .5,"I found this book a big disappointment. I hated all of the characters, including Neb, as they were all very irritating and flat characters that weren't humorous, interesting, or new. Big big disappointment, especially since Brian Jacques did such a great job on his redwall series. So, forget about reading this book."
2,Not much of a change from Redwall!,"The Redwall books have been getting quite similar lately, so I thought this book by Brian Jacques, written outside the Redwall series, would make a change. But I was wrong. Its getting boring how all of Jacques' books follow the same plot.There is always some cryptic puzzle to solve, the plots are predictable, and the characters aren't memorable. This one actually starts off better then most with the scenes onboard The Flying Dutchman, but quickly becomes boring. Brian Jaques has already written too many similar books- I wish he would write something completly different, like one of his earliest books, Seven Strange and Ghostly Tales. For now, all I can say is skip this one, and if you're looking for a real plot and some surprises and good writing, read Robin Jarvis' books. They haven't had the recognition they deserve for being twice as good as anything Brian Jacques could write."
5,awesome,Brian Jacques' Redwall series was good but the castaways of the flying dutchman was by far one of the best books I have ever read!! Keep writing Mr. Jacques
5,My daughter's favorite book,"My daughter is 2 and a half and she asks me to read this book to her every day. She loves finding the orange fishy on each page as well as identifying all of his friends. How many 2 years old know what a sea anemone is? Well thanks to this book she does. I am sure that this book will be the foundation of a life long love of the ocean. I just hope that when she is grown there will be some coral reefs left for her to explore. On a quick side note, if your child likes this book try I Saw the Sea and the Sea Saw Me by Megan Montague Cash. The two books are great when read together and will give your child a real appreciation for the creatures that inhabit our oceans."
2,Well made but average Shaw Brothers Kung Fu flick with several fairly creative deaths,Well made but average 1976 Shaw Brothers Kung Fu flick. Production values are very good for the time and the movie features most of the major actors working for Shaw Brothers when it was made. The highlights are actor Fu Sheng fighting spinning wooden men in tight corridors and several fairly creative deaths.
4,Shaw Bros.,"I enjoyed it but, would have rather have it in Chinese with English Subtitles rather than in English. Great movie though. Brings back memories!"
1,"Good film,","shame the dvd is a bootleg. The image has simply been stolen from the Hong Kong dvd, and not that well I might add. The film is owned by Dragon Dynasty in the US and should be coming out in the next year or so. If you have to see the film, get a region free dvd player for $40 and the world is your oyster!"
3,Fair Shot,"I just finished Moon Shots. It's an intriguing selection of fiction ranging from the more hard-core scientific to light fantasy, each story, of course, dealing in some fashion with the Moon. I read collections like these as introductions to writers I may not have otherwise heard about, and while some of the stories appealed to me more than others, overall I found this book pleasant reading late at night just before falling asleep... It's a great little book for someone whose tastes in fiction are varied and who may not have time to sit down through an entire novel. Good for a traveler or student with some interest or fascination with Luna."
2,Fable Found in this book,"Amazing Grace, Kathleen Norris, P. 322 & 3.The USMC stroy told here is an old urban type legion type fable that has been told since before Norris was born yet retold here as real."
2,Page 15 is outrageous and irrisponsible on The Clintons.,I enjoyed most of the contents of the book and found it in line with a mature Christians view and I would have given it 5 stars but for the remark that could be contrued as many seemingly innocent things have and cause harm to people. I would not like someone to say such a thing about me. How about you Kathleen Norris?
2,Not for me,"This is NOT what I expected. Unless you want to be uplifted spiritually, don't buy it. Not helpful in growing intellectually or thinking logically."
2,Poetic but Not Biblically Accurate,"After reading Kathleen Norris' book ""A Cloister Walk,"" I eagerly sought out this book but am very disappointed. What's interesting about ""Amazing Grace"" is that she makes a good point of riding the fence about being a Christian. She voices several points that are not Biblical, such as suggesting that all paths lead to God and that one can earn one's way to Heaven. Where is the Grace in that? Also, she rarely mentions Jesus who is at the center of Christian faith. It leaves me wondering if Norris actually believes in any of the things she espouses."
5,Amazing Grace,"This is an excellent reflection on one person's journey and is very helpful for my own reflection on my personal journey. Once again, thank you!"
5,Read it slowly,For some time I used this book for insights into various topics. Then I decided to read it just for itself. And I chose to read it slowly -- one essay at a time and let it ruminate. Norris is a Christian who is not always at ease with her faith or place within the church -- yet she is one of the most inspirational writers around today. Her faith is based in the realities of life -- yet she at times borders on what could be called mystical. It is the seeming contradictions that make her writing so wonderful.
4,Well Written,"I must disagree with the few reviews that state this book is poorly written. I found the writing style very clear and captivating. Perhaps these comments originate from some kind of snobbery towards taxi drivers !!I can't put my finger on exactly why, however I am slightly uncomfortable with the concept of the book. Having said this, I found the book to be one of the more enjoyable travel books I have read."
1,Dull Days on the Road,"""Take Me With You"" is the dullest travel book I've read in years. The author failed to inspirie me on several levels and I'm not certain whether this was due to the fact that he's not really a writer, but a traveler, and therefore perhaps thinks he can get away with writing a travel narrative on this basis alone, or else it's the fact that the book drags endlessly, listlessly, boring the reader to tears. I look forward to all new travel books and this oned failed to measure up to even the poorest of them. For a much better read, try Bill Bryson or Dervla Murphy."
2,Doesn't Measure Up,"I was quite disappoined that this book failed to inspire me due to its insipid writing style. Also, I hate the idea that this white guy from America goes off to find some poor brown man from a poor country so he can bring him back to the good ole USA to show him what he's missing. The book drags on and on and on and I only stayed with it to find out who he'd take home. It turns out he doesn't take anyone home after all. What a let-down."
1,Give it a miss,"The theme of this book is excellent: Brad Newsham wants to travel the world and invite a stranger home to see the US. Having said that, if you ever wonder why the American Traveler (Yanqui, as they say in South America) has a bad name, you should read this book to find out the answer. I've traveled a lot and read a lot of travelogues, and this is easily the most superfluous, pompous and arrogant travelogue I've come across. It's so very judgemental of other cultures from Philippines to India to South Africa and I really had a difficult time seeing past the huge turnoff that is. At the end of the book, the immediate feeling I had was ""Boy, I hope I'm not that negative or judgemental about anything, ever"" rather than an impression or good feeling about any of the many beautiful places he visited. I'd give it a miss - a good theme destroyed by a bad traveler & writer."
5,a great book,My husband and I read this book together and had such a great time discussing the different countries and the people the author met there. The author's insights are so close to our own that we felt like we were there with him (without staying in the $1/night hotel in Calcutta). Overall the book makes the reader grateful to be sharing the planet with such wonderful people and sad at the same time that so many have such limited opportunity in life.
3,Not as good as I expected,"As a frequent traveller who has always depended on Frommers, I purchased for the first time a Fodors guide to Russia (alas, Frommers will not publish one for a few months). I am sorry to say that I find this book to be confusing in finding activities to see in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Keep in mind that I am both a Reading teacher and an English teacher, so that if I had difficulty sorting out where to go and how to find the sight, it must really be weak. Also, some sights were overlooked. In short, wait for the Frommers addition to be published."
5,Donnie Blanz - Western Americana,Length:: 7:41 MinsDonnie Blanz is the consummate Western Americana artist.
3,Not Their Strongest Effort,"While not as quite as strong as ""Sharks"" or the Schenker-less ""You Are Here"", ""Covenant"" has indeed some good songs. 'Unraveled', 'Midnight Train', and 'Miss The Lights' are killer showcasing Michael Schenker's guitar work. However, the song 'Serenade' should have been thrown out. With this CD comes a bonus live disc. I guess in the rush to put this out, they misidentified these live songs. The correct order is: 1)Mother Mary 2)This Kids 3)Let It Roll 4)Out In The Street 5)Venus 6)Pushed To The Limit 7)Love To Love. The sound quality of this live disc is poor, plus it sounds as though the guys are playing to a crowd of just 50 people."
3,Not one of their best,"I am a huge UFO, Michael Schenker, and Vinnie Moore fan. I wouldn't say I was disappointed, just not enthused."
4,ufo continues to create good metal.,This is not as powerful as 'walk on water' or 'sharks' which also had michael schenker on them. But it's got some really good songs and some that are average melodic metal fair as well. I think 'walk on water' is a metal classic and this one is just not as powerful song wise at all. But it's still good and has a bonus disc of live material as well.
5,Awesome!,"As usual, Stephen King always packs the pages full of suspense. Even though this was one of his shorter works, it was highly entertaining and definitely worth reading."
3,Hitchhiking...,...has always seemed scary to me. Maybe this will prevent a few people from being stupid. Like his short stories when there are a bunch stuffed into a fat book.
5,GREAT Book,"I like any thing by Stephen King. I've read every single book he has every put out. Some were great! Others ""Like the DArk Tower Series"" not so much but, he is an outstanding author."
3,Riding the Bullet = 5 / Old DRM = 1,"I wonder how many still have their old free downloads from back around 2000. I had the book for awhile along with a few others bought at Amazon, and where are they now? All gone... The DRM will never allow a book to be a book or an ebook buyer to be independent. That is why I will think twice before throwing any money at a DRM ebook.I liked Riding the Bullet much like I liked Apt Pupil."
5,Its Stephen at his best,It is Mr. King at his best. The story will catch you from the very start and you will not be able to put it down. If is a shorter story then we are used to but still very good.
2,Did not like it,Not much to say on this one. Could not get into it. Tried twice and failed. So it gets dumped from the collection.
4,Very good but short,"I made a mistake of reading this book before I went to bed last night. It was a very good book, and my only complaint is that it was very short. On the other hand it was nice to finish a book in 2 hours. I would recomend this book to anyone who wants a short scary read. This is a book every Stephen King fan should read!"
2,Misleading Item Description,"Although the story was enjoyable, I based my purchase of the Kindle edition on the Print Length of 400 pages listed in the item description and was disappointed to discover that, rather than a full-length novel, I had received a short story.Amazon, please correct your misleading item description!"
2,Misleading item description,"As did some other reviewers, I decided to purchase this based on Amazon's description of it being 400 pages, and was surprised and disappointed when it ended just as I was settling in for a good read. I do enjoy Stephen King's short stories, but this one was just okay. Next time I'll actually READ the reviews before purchasing!"
4,Have you ridden the Bullet?,"Excellent creepy story once you ride the bullet time is of the essence!"" I'd hitchhike down to Lewiston, then out to our little house in Harlow if it wasn't too late. If it was, I'd snooze in one of the hospital lounges. It wouldn't be the first time I'd ridden my thumb home from school. Or slept sitting up with my head leaning against a Coke machine, for that matter. """" Not a single light out there except for the moon. The trees rushed by, writhing like spontaneous dancers at a tent-show revival. The road rushed under us. I looked at the speedometer and saw he was up to eighty miles an hour. We were riding the bullet right now , he and I; the dead drive fast."""
2,"S'okay, but it's a short story","Since the description of this book says it has 400 pages, I was a little surprised to find the digital version has just about that many 'locations' ... the DTB must have VERY LARGE TYPE or HUGE MARGINS. It's a so-so story, but awfully short. I had to go back to see what I'd paid for it. Too much: $3.99 for 400 locations while 'Infinite Jest' with more than 25,000 locations was $9.99 - what's up with *that!?"
1,"UPC sticker stuck directly to dust jacket, TWICE","I ordered this collectible edition and had to return it twice. The first time I received the item I noticed there was a UPC (price code) sticker directly attached to the dust jacket, making this otherwise collectible item far from valuable. I tried peeling the sticker off but could tell it was going to tear the dust jacket so I stopped. I returned the item and explained why I had returned it. I asked for a replacement, since I really wanted this book, and the replacement copy arrived two weeks later...and it had a sticker on the dust jacket! Forget it. I returned it again and asked for a refund."
2,I don't like it.,"I chose this rating because the product is not what I expected. Would not recommend the product to anyone, ever."
1,Not very mobile,"Works okay when using a microphone. Works very poorly when using the recorder that comes with the package. I have trained Dragon, but the translating from the recorder is very bad. If I try to translate 3-4 sentences, it may get 2 or 3 words. I have used Dragon before and this is not typical of Dragon and it is not typical of using the microphone. But the application that I am using this for needs to use the recorder and I have been very disappointed."
1,rip off of $10 for EACH call or e-mail for support!,"I will definitely NOT buy this product. I refuse to be RIPPED OFF $10 for EACH AND EVERY time you e-maill or call customer service. This is totally ludicrous, and the support service should be included with the purchase of the product. Apparent Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking is trying to squeeze every nickle and dime out of their customers. I refuse to by any product by a company that will do that to their customers. I think this is about the ONLY company that charges for their support. Try to find an alternative voice recognition software company who will support their product free of charge. SHAME ON YOU, NUANCE DRAGON NATURALLY SPEAKING."
1,Watch out.. NO CD INCLUDED!,"I was expecting to receive the book, it supposed to include a cd but it didnt. Now i have to buy another book or try to find the cd somewhere else."
3,A Bit Dissapointed - But Still Pretty Good,"I was a bit let down by this Critters Buggin album. It's good ambient music (background music), but not a great listen. There are very few tracks that stick out. I liked tracks like ""Imperial Turkey Blister"" and ""Emporer Chi Chi"", but there isn't much else here. I'm an absolutely HUGE fan of Skerik, but there are next to no sax solos anywhere. I know this may have not much to do with the musicallity of the record, but the first three Critters albums started off with a great song that always had great beats and well-used samples. This one is pretty slow and relaxed through-out. That could be a result of Tuatara's influence on Skerik, and if so the styles of the two bands don't mix well. It's a good album, but I wouldn't recomend it for a first listen of Critters Buggin's music. Go for Host or Guest first, then check this one out. They're a great band."
5,Easy to read and to practice,Andy Stanley makes light work of creating biblical community. His style is as easy to read as Andy is to listen to. You will be challenged and encouraged as you put these principles into action.
3,An average sharings / sermon-liked books,There are some good sharings in this book. Some does provide insight. But sometimes it's just made me feel that the chapters are only the collections of the author's sermons.
4,Good book to begin,"With the task to help create a small group area in my church i recomend this book as a good starting point.I usually don't like the very personal writing style that the author adopt, I don't care to know his personal problems and spiritual conflicts.But beneath that sentimental stuff there is a good road map to begin planning a small group ministry. It is an esay reading book ( a blessing in our days) with an important message."
1,Couldnt even finish it,Meh. This one really sucked which is odd because Bond is usually very good. I've loved almost all her books.
4,Yummy story,"When you can picture the scene in your head like a movie scene, then I rate it very high. I even copied the recipe because of the mouth-watering description. A good read for a snowy wintry day."
4,Great Story!,"Loved the story, characters were well rounded and believable. We all should have a Grandmother like the one in this story! I felt it was quite heartwarming. The love scenes were steamy!! You will NOT be disappointed, plus a delicious recipe at the end!"
4,Now I Finally Understand All Those Pompous Roman Letters,"This is a fascinating book about the ways in which status, recognition, and the conferral of distinctions were used to govern the Roman empire and a compelling explanation of such methods' genesis in Greco-Roman culture. It assumes a high degree of familiarity with Roman history, but complete familiarity with the book's historical references is not necessary to appreciate the basic argument being made. Also, for the first time for me, this book makes sense of a great deal of the seemingly gassy Roman letters and inscriptions praising various people."
4,Lifts the heart,"THE HARE AND THE BIG GREEN LAWNHare bought a house with a huge lawn of green grass, but while his neighbors, Skunk, Bobcat and Raven, work hard to keep up their lawns of clipped, perfect grass, Hare relaxes and waits. His lawn dies, rain turns it into mud. His neighbors frown, but Hare knows just what he's waiting for. The outcome is one of color and fragrance that brings his neighbors together.The book is filled with color and colorful characters and the ending lifts the heart and makes me want to go out and start a wildflower garden.While, at first, the book may appear to reward laziness, the objective is quite different--valuing the beauty of our native plant and animal life. It is a call back to what is really important for our environment and our lives. Beautifully done.---Author's Choice Reviews: Carolyn R Scheidies"
3,"A ""hare-y"" tale about a weedy lawn.","The storyline about the hare letting his lawn die until a meadow grew in its place was cute. I especially liked the illustrations. I'd say the pictures were the best aspect of the book. The story itself wasn't all that catchy or full of rhymes as children's stories often are. The moral, however, was worthwhile. What the hare's peers originally thought about his neglect turned around when they realized he was growing a ""neighborhood meadow"" like they remembered. They'd forgotten the beauty of the natural meadow because they were busy tending their own lawns. They ended up arm in arm with smiles on their faces as they enjoyed the meadow and watched the fireflies. Nice ending"
1,A Big Disappointment,"I bought the Sony walkman with TV tuner and was quite exctied, this didn't last very long. All but one station have really bad reception, this is also true of the preset radio stations, really poor quality reception. It's so cumbersome to use, the belt clip is on the case, it doensn't have auto reverse so each time you want to flip your casette you must take it from the case. Poorly designed. My first Sony product, probably my last as well. Didn't return the product because I threw out the originally packaging. Big Mistake on my part."
4,Horrible reception and design.,"I got this unit as a replacement for a unit I placed under an extended store warranty plan, and I couldn't be more disappointed with this product. The reception is horrible, even in the city the station is in. The buttons are too easy to hit, which is aggravating when a good song is on when you hit the ""preset station"" button. The case is terrible, and could damage the tape player while you depress the tape buttons to fit the case in. Not up to Sony's wonderful standards.Updated in January 2004; I've gotten used to the product's problems, and since I reviewed three years ago I've gotten an MP3 player, so the tape player doesn't matter to me anymore. In the long run it's a great product, the station reception did improve considerably after buying a headset with a longer cord, and since then the button design has improved on later redesigns of this product."
3,A Non-Stop Reader,"Once beginning to read this book, it is very difficult to put it down. A most captivating account of this man's fall into a lifestyle of homosexual behavior, his struggle to understand it and to eventually come out of it. I am amazed to realize that this man could have been my best friend, or acquaintance at work, and I would never have even known he was gay. The book is interlaced with humor, a mix of comedy and tragedy, ending in triumph. Especially interesting is the final chapter, a step by step suggested formula for understanding and overcoming homosexuality. You can't argue with this man's point of view. He's obviously been there and knows what he's talking about. It must have taken a lot of courage to speak so openly about his life, past and present. I strongly recommend this book to anyone struggling with the homosexual issue, whether for himself, or in the interest of someone else. FIVE STARS!!"
1,So So Book,"When I went through the book, at first it seemed great. But then as you get deeper into the book. It's just facts being repeated. And the book is so old and out-dated. The facts that are in it, most don't even apply anymore.Save you money and don't bother to buy this book."
1,leaves much to be desired,"I expected more than just a collection of art works in abstract style--it's left to the viewer to figure out the inspiration, how it was done, etc. You get the title of the work--a clue--and sometimes what media was used--there is not much print in the book except for the titles and sometimes media. I've seen abstract art before and can guess at some of the inspirations--I didn't need the collection of abstract artworks that are in the book. It would have been nice to have explanations of media, method or some guidance other than just look at the pictures, because that is all there is."
5,Sinisterly intriguing and wondeful.,"Gregorian - The Dark side is a wonderful masterpiece Not to say that i'm biased because of the fact that i have a couple of their CDs, but this album is in itself a well made one. Tracks like ""Unbeliever"" has that essential Verocity that made this compliation a pleasure to listen to.Some tracks simply sounded out of place with the lyrics. But somehow, it still soudned good at the end.""My immortal"" sounded weird at first but as soon as the tune got its flow, the essence of it came through. However i felt that the chants could do less with the rock edge to it. Though it provides a different experience, it does prove a little distracting at times. Overall, a very good listening experience as with the other Gregorian Albums, a place worthy in my collection of favourtites. =)"
5,Add it to your collection,"I am a fan of ""Masters of Chant"" and this is a great CD to add to any Gregorian collection. Nice collection of music and enjoyable to listen to in a candle-lit castle/room. Check the other CD's out if you are not familiar with this group, especially I-III, and if you like them get Amazon's boxed set of IV-VI; all enjoyable. Listen to some of their Christmas music on Amazon, too."
2,"Master thesis, not a novel.","I bought this book under the assumption that it would delve into the hazing aspect of BGLO's at a...normal...view point. I bought this book for an extension of my studies of BGLOS's, hazing, and hazing's origins. I'd seen this book a few years ago, and researched it before I actually bought it, and before I bought it, I read a sample. Once I bought the book, I felt SO let down!This book is a huge jumble of overly large words, assumptions, and guesses; I've found more profound knowledge on Youtube regarding BGLO's. This book reads like a master thesis with no entertainment value or real substance. This book does have it's plusses (though I can't think of any at the moment), but it does not live up to the hype. I would recommend reading Divine Nine, Captain of my Soul, and Rev. Hatchett's book ""coming apart at the seams""."
5,Early Cocker,"Great, great CD. Had the vinyl in the 70's. Every song is great. This was the time when he used to have Leon Russel in his band. I saw Cocker in performance in Seattle in the early 70's. Complete with red, white and blue stripped pants with platform shoes. He was amazing. The is before that time. A real rockin/blues CD. You can't go wrong with this one."
3,Pretty good follow up--great sound!,"A & M has done an uncharacteristically good job on remastering the early Cockers. The sound here is just beautiful, with a sharpness and clarity lacking on the previous version. If you liked the original, you'll hear stuff on this version you never heard before. Don't buy it for the bonus tracks--She's Good To Me is so-so and Let It Be gets a bit tedious after awhile."
5,Joe Cocker!,"It is silly to give this cd anything but a five star rating. First, there is the excellent choice of tunes. When it originally came out it was considered hip, funky, and powerful. Here's an Englishman sounding like Ray Charles doing Dylan, Beatles, Cohen, John Sebastian, and Leon Russell (who produced this). Secondly, the thing sociologically reeks of prime hippie era panache. If you were around when this came out then you'll understand, if you didn't then this is an excellent blues based example of counter culture rock with a tinge of country."
3,Needs a revision--a little out of date,"First, you should probably familiar yourself with assembly programming before you read this book. It will accelerate the learning progress greatly.The first three sections of this book were great. However, I had a no luck getting SoftICE to run correctly on Windows XP. I browsed some online forums and noticed other people with the same problem. Since it appeared that the vast majority of the rest of the book relied on the use of SoftICE, I put the book down and never returned.It was also a pain getting some of these old hacker utilities the author used. I didn't even manage to get them all. Author, please put them online or give us a clue!Also, some brief examples of some Linux application alternatives would have been appreciated."
4,solid introduction to reverse compilation techniques,"I thought this was a pretty good book. First, to the 'reviewer' (in quotes since he didnt read the book beyond the very beginning) -- very little of the book makes any use of softice. The tool mostly used is Interactive Disassembler (a commercial tool available from datarescue) but any disassembler will do.The book is about the code typically generated by compilers of various forms (mostly c and c++, some pascal as well). If you want to understand the disassembly, you must grok what Christina Cifuentes calls idioms (instruction sequences that have an effect different than the usual intended meaning).This book is very much a collection of idioms. It's a good primer to the art of reverse engineering, and maybe readers can move on to general decompilation papers for further study, starting with ""Reverse Compilation Techniques"" by Ciguentes, and moving on to more modern papers."
2,Bo English subtitle,"I was disappointed as there was no English subtitle, even though you have it listed as haqving one. I do not speak French or Korean so I could not enjoy the novie as it is, a real classic which I like."
5,I went to South Africa,"This book took me to South Africa. I love every word, sentence and chapter of this book. When I finished this book, I found myself going back to visit the chracters, because I had missed them. Highly recommended. This is a story of faith, and love. I can't wait until this author writes another book. Please hurry!!!!!!"
2,Dissappointing Animation,"I guess most of the collection are quite poor in the quality of animation either in the 3D model itself or the story line. A lot of the 3D animations didn't have a good control on the timing, ""gravity"" and ""Ummph""!The story line for most of the animations also doesn't impressed me. I've seen an animation collection VHS from PIXAR 3 years ago (actually it was out 5yrs ago) and the quality is superb! This DVD is a dissappointment to me."
2,4 Pepper Sauce by Mannheim Steamroller,"The sauce was somewhat flavorful, but thin and runny with a weak flavor. Would not buy this again. I expected more from Mannheim Steamroller."
1,Dissapointing attempt at writing on important topic,"This book appears to have been butchered by non-scientific editors who have removed essential explanation of diagrams and shortened any sentence that appeared to have syntax that would trouble anyone over the age of thirteen. I opened it with high hopes since I was looking for a gentle introduction to an important topic that I could recommend as initial reading for students. But I hesitate to let students near it since it has so many mistakes and blunders. (One quote: `Together with Niels Bohr, Wheeler discovered fission'. Has any scientifically educated person looked through the text before publication??)The fact that diagrams are full of elements that are not referred to in the text is symptomatic of the very unprofessional way that this book has been produced. Aczel actually has some nice persnal anecdotes... what a wasted opportunity!"
3,More of a review than speculation,"The majority of the book is a review of the history of physics leading up to the current understanding of entanglement, including much biographical information about the major players in the quantum mechanics arena. I would have liked to see more than just that last short chapter talking about the implications and possibilities of entanglement."
1,"Great book, bad publishing","I enjoyed the book until about page 200, when the pages were out of order (not the page numbers, the text) and diagrams were missing. This edition of the book should be pulled from Amazon. Buy the paperback instead, the publisher got it right."
1,Unfinished book,"The book seems to be unfinished. Incorrect Spelling: ""Shroedinger"". Material is generally superficial and not scientific. References are very limited. Interesting material on the personalities of the physicists such as Schroedingers education and his affairs with a series of women."
1,Don't bother with this mess...,As a physics buff I had high hopes for this book. The subject has always fascinated me. Sadly this book is a mess. The author has no ability to communicate clearly. This book is more of an historical account than anything else. Who cares where a scientist is born and how he grew up. There are numerious un-explained cryptic diagrams. When the author does explain an experiment it's a confused jumble. Don't let the intrigue of this subject trap you into reading this very poorly written book.You will end up more confused and frustrated then enlightened.
3,OK Thomspon,"""Recoil"" is second-tier work by Jim Thompson (check out ""The Grifters"" and ""The Killer In Me""), but it's still an entertaining quick read. The main character is Pat Cosgrove, who's been in prison for 15 years for bank robbery. He gets out on parole with the help of Dr. Luther, a discredited and shady psychologist who now works with local politicians. Pat figures out pretty quickly that Dr. Luther must have had a reason for helping him, but what is it? Pat becomes involved with a bunch of politicians, lawyers, civil servants, and (of course) women, any of whom might be double crossing him. The action is fast and the writing is enjoyable. As with some of his other books, a lot of the action is unbelievable, but so what?"
3,"Enjoyable, but not Thompson's best","A nice, fast-paced book, but not on the same level as such classics as ""The Killer Inside Me"" and ""After Dark, My Sweet"" (my favorite). It has one of those convoluted noir plots (think ""Touch of Evil"") where about ten double crosses are occuring simultaneously and the reader has to draw a chart of who is betraying who and why as they read along. Good characterization and a couple of great scenes elevate it above the average crime novel. If you are a Thompson fan, definitely read it. If not, ""Recoil"" probably isn't the best place to start."
4,AVERAGE THOMPSON,"This is just an average Jim Thompson book, which still makes it better than a lot of the junk out there right now, but not as good as ""The Killer Inside Me"" or ""The Getaway"". It's nonetheless worth reading, and as a woman, reading Thompson is such a treat. I get a lot of flack for saying this, and many women disagree, but his female characters are amazing. I just love them all. They're so brilliantly written, and besides the fact that his books are based on Greek mythology (ripping off the classics is a tried and true way of writing a great story) that's the main reason why I read him. This book is no letdown in the awesome babes department. Two very unforgettable criminal-type women inhabit the pages of this book."
2,Weak first draft of The Getaway,"Recoil is not a terrible book, but it is not as strong as most of Thompson's other work. It is a predecessor to The Getaway, and the latter is a much better reworking of the former. Like The Golden Gizmo, South of Heaven, and Trick of the Tail, it is worth reading, but only after Population 1280, Savage Night, Hell of a Woman, Swell Looking Babe, Killer Inside Me, Nothing Man, Kill-off, Criminal, etc. You get the idea. It is better than The Transgressors, however, and I suspect it is better than Cropper's Cabin."
2,"Good, But Not So Good. Not what I expected.","The DVD wasn't as good as I expected. St. Laurent talked about his life, but did not show many garments. I expected a runway show of some of his creations, but didn't get one. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,A solid text on manifolds,"I have some reservations:1) no notation/ symbols page2) uses the Klein Map but doesn't give the name3) no clear affine and projective manifold classificationBut in contrast it has good handling of diffeomorphisms and integrationson manifolds.I bought it to the Weeks space manifold, M003[3,-1], and the polyhedron forms that Weeks uses. It isn't reallyof use in that more modern area of manifold theory either.The Thurston space manifold, M003[2,-3], isn't covered.The book is a good introductory text that I wish I would have had 40 years ago!"
4,"Terse, not the best available","This is the unofficial ""standard reference"" on the subject. Lots of more advanced books cite it, and it certainly covers a lot of ground. The problem is it is a bit too terse. I say that as a math type. Were I a physics type I'd want a more visual approach. If you are learning tensor geometry though this book is worth having as a reference, and the price is right."
3,Tough for self-study,"I have been using this book to study differential geometry for many years - a little bit at a time. This book is a fairly complete introduction to the subject. However, it does a poor job motivating and explaining the subject. I found it necessary to supplement with several other texts to really get a good grasp on the material in the book. A number of times, I have picked up something in another book and have gone back to this book and realized that I had not ""gotten it"" the first time through. If the book had more examples and concrete calculations it would go a long way to clarifying the material.I would recommend getting a book like Guggenheimer's Differential Geometry and reading it first. This book then does a good job of generalizing the ideas to many dimensions."
2,Many Duplicates,"This CD is pretty good Sleepy LaBeef music, but I already had Flying Saucers Rock 'n Roll and all but a handful of tracks are duplicates. If you already have LaBeef's Flying Saucers R&R, not worth getting this one."
5,the best in west coast political punk,"while not overly political, the band satanic surfers is some of the best west coast hard core punk i have heard. once i started listening to this album i couldnt stop, i listened to it every day for 2 months. tracks that especially got a message across were ""institutionalizing murder"" and the second track, about the lack of choice in people to elect for running your lives and telling you how to live. i would suggest this album to anyone who is a fan of fast music, and everyone who is a fan of melodic music. -Monk"
3,its okay....,Ive only had the cd for a day and listend to everyone song once maybe twice for some. a couple good songs. most are nothing special. but it'll probably grow on me the more i listen to it like most do
1,Dribbles all over,"I bought two OXO kettles, stainless finish for use at home and green for use at a cabin. Gave up using the green one; you could not pour from it without dribbling all over the counter top. But the stainless one is OK. The spout design is different, although both are ""Good Grips Downpour"": the green one has a rolled lip around the spout, and this causes the problem. The stainless one lacks the rolled lip."
3,Bandit Price Author,"This book isn't even written by Grisham! I thought the purpose is to review the book, not the price, and you didn't even purchase it."
1,Bandit price,"No way I will pay $36 for a book that I cannot even lend to friends.Gresham better get his feet on the ground fast, and price reasonably. He is not that good that he can price to the sky and expect much.In the meantime there are armies of good authors who are cranking out excellent works, many offered in Kindle. And many books in Amazon's used department at very attractive prices."
4,"solitude from humanity, intergrating with the natural world","Only by being down in the canyon can one truly appreciate the natural wonder of what it is. Fletcher takes us there, through descriptions of surroundings and his thought processes while en route. An awe-inspiring and humbling experience. It would be hard for any reader who has not been below the rim to fully appreciate the contents of this book. Fletcher does an admirable job of attempting to relay the impact the canyon can have upon a person."
1,The man who walked through time moved slower then a sloth!,"I am an avid backpacker as well as an avid book reader. I picked this book up after finding it on a reading list handed out by one of my perfesors. I expected an adventure full of zeal and corisma, but found only a mundan account of on man's attempt at bieng profound. Colin Fletcher uterly failed and should be banished. *Note to Colin Fletcher- Please Don't write any more BooKs!"
4,Colin Fletcher's trip through the Grand Canyon,"Colin Fletcher just died. His early books on back-packing helped me getv started in the sport when I was young and green; he made it sound romantic, desireable, and achievable. and it was.This book about his traverse through the Gran Canyon is vintage Flecther. Lots of fairly florid prose, many meandering philosophical discussions, and a few solid shareable insights. For a forty-year old out-of-shape brit it was quite an exploration, though he probably wasn't the first, and certainly didn't do the entire canyon.I read it while riding down the Colorado on a dory, and it was fun comparing his percpetions of the world around us with amazing reality of that trip."
3,Magazine Rack,"Table arrived in timely manner and needed to be put together, which was very easy. It is worth the $28+ shipping, but certainly not the $250+ that it was said to be marked down from. It is pressed wood under a very shinny venire, so if you don't like shinny furniture, this might not be your best choice. I have it next to my Queen Ann chair and it fits OK. So, you get what you pay for and for the money it's not bad."
3,Another One Song CD for me,"I like Tom Rush. His very best tune was ""I Lost My Drivin Wheel."" It has such a lonesome sound to it, long slide Dobro or National Steel weeping in the background, creates a very haunting song. I think that indeed Tom Rush was looking for that sound and he got it.As for the rest of the stuff on the album I didn't really care for it all that much. One song he talks his way thru, didn't impress me at all. Come on Tom you got a great voice sing it for Pete's sake.If you don't know about Tom Rush or are unsure of his style and music I'd pass on this album. If you are like me and want one song on it them bite the bullet and buy it, that's my advice."
2,"...No, No, No..",...Get Tom's Circle Game CD b4 this one..it has the proper version of No Regrets without the crappy overblown string section..And I was a Saturday dj at Harvard..The Club 47 was the go to place..I sat with Baez & Dylan drinking beers at the long table..even got arrested outside of club..those were the daze my friends.!
3,Criticism or Political Tract?,"Well, the book's fairly interesting when it talks about the history of Russian Academic art, and also when it explores the work of Neizvestny. But the third section degenerates into a Marxist scrred against ""imperialism"". The book was written in the late 60's, so I suppose I can understand the author's optimism (naivite?) about the prospects of Communism, but all the same, I finished the book feeling that Neizvestny had been used by the author to further his own viewpoint. The description of the book, read in retrospect, is more interesting than the contents."
2,Yoga Zone,Suppose this might be a good video for some to try Yoga with but definitely not for beginners and for someone that has a hard time kneeling or sitting Indian style. Not made for bigger people.
4,A nice practice,"I didn't think I'd like Alan Finger because he seems so odd, but I think he's actually a really good instructor--leading you through the poses very clearly and well, and offering a good philosphy for practice. The only thing about this DVD is that it's one workout only, so you don't feel like you're getting much value for your money. That being said, everytime I do this workout, I'm suprised how much I enjoy it. It's a good supplementary DVD, but you'll definitely need more just for variety's sake."
5,Yoga Zone,"A very intense yoga workout for me! I couldn't even finish the whole disc since it's intermediate & I haven't done yoga in a while! The instructor is very good at explaining everything step by step- breathing techniques, positioning & etc. Also a great stress reliever! I felt so relaxed after doing this session, although my muscles were sore from not doing yoga in a while."
2,Disappointed after reading other reveiws!,"I borrowed this from the library hoping I would love it enough to purchase it after reading the other reviews here. I'm glad, after veiwing it, that I didn't buy it first.As a beginner, I do need instruction on proper breathing, posture, etc.. but I found this program involved too much instruction! I kept thinking, ""Ok, I get it. Now be quiet so I can concentrate!"""
3,Not quite up to Yoga Zone's excellent standards,"I hesitate to say anything vaguely critical of Yoga Zone material, but.....this tape seems less complete than their others. On the plus side, the relaxation segment at the end is excellent, and the poses are well described. There are some strong poses, but it's not a strength workout--good for days when you're not quite up to a power yoga session. I recommend their Condioning and Stress Release (the best I've ever seen) over this one, especially to those new to yoga. I'll probably use this occasionally for variety."
3,OK but not great,I bought this video looking for a relaxing/stretching routine. I found it more challenging than I would expect for a relaxation sequence and the tape seemed to focuss more on the scenery and philosophy than actual practice. I have never bought a yoga zone tape before but do enjoy my Living Arts and Om Yoga ones. Tried it once and probably won't ever use it again...
3,This Yoga Guy is kind of ..... strange.,"I'm very new to Yoga, so don't take my advice if you are an expert.I thought the guy (Alan Finger?) was a few cards short of a full deck.Although it doesn't say it anywhere on Amazon.com, this is marked as an Intermediate Level Yoga tape. However, as an out of shape person trying to get in shape (and more flexable), I am able to perform most of these exercised in the modified form.Just my two cents."
3,The Worst Rip-Off I've Ever Seen,"The Pros: ""Hunger Strike"" is an amazing song (the second best on the album and my personal favorite).The Cons:1. The other two songs are fine but not great.2. There is nothing rare about the track list.3. YOU CAN BUY THE WHOLE ALBUM FOR LESS MONEY THAN IT COSTS TO GET THREE TRACKS, TWO OF WHICH ARE NOT THE BEST IT HAS TO OFFER.If you buy this, you've either a collector or insane. The only reason this gets three stars is because ""Hunger Strike"" is a five-star song."
3,Excellent research served with baloney ...,"""Union With Christ"" creates a divided reaction from the reader: The excellent research of the Finnish scholars leaves nothing to be desired. Superb, highly academic research, clearly structured, and well argued. I might not agree with all of their points, but they certainly did their homework well.On the other hand, you have the responses of the editors, namely Braaten and Jenson. I've never seen something as incredibly void of content as this! In the words of one of my professors, this is ""baloney."" I always thought ""responses"" should contain something more than ""I agree with what he said, so let me summarize it again.""Conclusion: If you don't read Finnish or German, and you want access to the breaking edge of Luther research, here's the book to buy. On the other hand, if you're looking for a decent evaluation of the Finnish position, stay away from this book -- you will be greatly disappointed."
3,A Very Basic Biography,"I bought this book years ago, in the height of my Billy Joel admiration, and I found it quite enjoyable. It gives lots of info about how he broke into the music business. The writing style is such that it seems that it's geared towards school-age readers, but none-the-less an enjoyable book for any true fan."
5,Good book,Great read. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in history. It will definitely keep you engaged and is a good source of knowledge.
3,Used battery,"These type of laptop batteries are a bit unwieldy, so I would rather not have to carry around 2 or 3 extra laptop batteries to get a couple hours of use. I don't know how many fuel cells this battery has, but I would like to have purchased one with the maximum amount."
4,I had been searching for this book.,I had been searching for this book because the narrative of someone whose search for the easy life lands them in prison is very poignant. It is an autobiographical snapshot by a con artist who brought sorrow to his loved ones. My Grandmother was one of those who desperately wanted to believe in him so that personal connection made the book more relevant to me.
4,Few track issues,"During one of the scenes the picture has some tracking issues, but it resolves quickly. It's understandable for a VHS."
5,Vivian Vande Velde is awsome,"Not only is she a great writter but she has one of the coolest pen names. Vivian Vande Velde. What a name! But she's not just a cool name. She has one of the greatest writting styles. She really makes the characters come alive. ""The Changeling Prince"" was another one of her greats. I always love the characters in her books because they have so much life. Being a teen and reading them is even better. All of the Characters are in your age range. In so many of my favorite books the characters are so much older than me. I don't really relate. But in her books her Characters or Main Character is a teen. I feel like I can relate so much easier. Weiland, the main Character in this book, is sixteen years old. In Vivian Vande Velde's book ""Companions of the Night"" her main character is also sixteen. (That is another good book I would recommend.) I hope you read these books and fall in love with them the way I did. Enjoy."
3,A good read,"This story is quite a bit better then The Conjurer Princess. Weiland is a wolf changed into a human, who loathes his wolf's nature. Held captive by the cruel witch who changes him back and forth, he wrestles with the moral dilemmas of his actions as a wolf and plots to escape. The theme is not trivial and it is thrown into sharp relief against the simplistic telling of his story. Well done."
5,Well written!,I thought this book was a smoothly written book about a young man that had been raised by a very evil woman. It had a nice flow to it. I thought it was very good.
1,Useless release.,"This may be an historical document ; but this is not music you can enjoy listening to. The band was not good that special night, several songs are very short - around one minute - , and the sound is so bad that it's hard to listen more than 5 minutes. One or two songs from this concert at the end of another Slim Harpo's cd would have been enough."
4,Two often-overlooked Teddy Pendergrass albums now on CD.,"Buy this CD while you still can as it contains two of Teddy's best yet mostly-forgotten albums.The 1981-issued ""It's Time For Love"" contains some of Teddy's smoothest soul ballads with ""She's Over Me"", ""Nine Times Out Of Ten"" and the title track being simply unmissable. On the other hand, the 1982-released ""This One's For You"" was the first of two studio albums consisting of previously unreleased tracks that Philadelphia International issued after Teddy's near-fatal car accident. This 2-CD set brings you two fine Teddy Pendergrass albums at a very good price- buy it now!"
3,No less obscure,"""Divided Natures: French Contributions to Political Ecology"" covers a broad range of Gaulic political ecophilosophy over the past half century. While an interesting summary and exposition, the author, Kerry Whiteside, does little to hold the attention of the reader for any of several reasons.I was particularly struck by the feeling that Whiteside has spent very little time exploring aspects of the natural world outside of his head. And therein lies the problem with his conclusions. It's like Alfred North Whitehead's comment of his friend, Bertrand Russell's first Harvard lecture on the Quantum Theory: ""I'd like to thank Professor Russell for his brilliant exposition. And especially for leaving unobsecured the vast darkness of the subject.""Bernie Krause, PhD"
5,The world's prettiest white man comes through...,"...yet again. I've owned this CD since August '99, and its pleasure has not diminished after a year. Green is still a thrilling singer, the production is great (Gamson rules), he wears his influences (Foo Fighters, Veruca Salt, Beatles, Beach Boys, underground hip hop artists, etc.) very openly on his sleeve. In short, a great pop album. What more do you want?"
2,...Green come back to life!,"After waiting over 10 years for Green's new set of tunes, I am somewhat dissappointed. I can listen to this CD and enjoy some of the beat loops,grooves and guitar induced rock tunes. And thankfully there is one song I REALLY like, ""UMM"", but I just don't find enough melodies, enough of Green period. He's almost backround noise on many of the tracks and his whispery harmonies that made Scritti so unique are few and far between. DOn't get me wrong, I'm all for updating their sound but not eliminating their sound. I don't mind if a rapper guests on a song for a bridge the way Culture Club does, but on this CD they just outnumber Green!What's even more depressing is that the tunes that are reminiscent of their old style, Mystic Handyman, Brushed WIth Oil,Born To Be,and First Goodbye are just not that good. Melodies are weak and it's shocking! Green has always previously been such a pop craftsman. Truly dissappointing."
2,Disapointment- Period.,"I've been a fan of Scriti since I first heard ""Cupid & Psyche"" in 1985. The follow-up, ""Provision"" was ""OK""- but this album really disapoints. All the talent, lyrics and luster is missing from this one. Glad I listened to it here first before buying(thanks Amazon!). Scritti fans- you've been warned!"
4,Inconsistant. moments of genious then... horrible (yikes),"I picked up this album because I found out that Wendy and Lisa and Meshell NdegeOcello were involved. All of those folks are extremely talented in their own right... Meshell being about the funkiest woman on the planet and Wendy&Lisa adding dark earthy grooves.In some ways the album is a huge success, the fascinating wispy harmonies combined with low end grit and funk (plus really good rapping) works about 1/2 the time. Occassionally the album suffers from seriously poofy, lightweight british goofiness. I mean... completely cheesy.But just listen to Tinseltown & Boogie to hear a great crossover hit, and Here Come July is actually good power pop with great harmonies.Skip the 4 horrible songs and this CD would almost be nearly genius!"
1,Nothing like their last two albums,"I couldn't have been a bigger fan back in 1984 when I first heard Wood Beez but that certainly has changed after hearing this. Yikes! What a stinker. Who thought putting Green together with rap and hip hop was a good idea? The LEAST they could do was make it ""danceable."""
2,do you like hip-hop?,"I bought this because I liked the first two SP albums and I'd read 2 positive reviews of this new CD. The reviews mentioned that Green used more hip-hops beats, but failed to detail the absolute depths to which this disc was devoted to hip-hop. Almost every song features a team of hip-hop rappers.The result is a bit strange. The rhythms are good, the tunes catchy, but the mixture of tough-guy hip-hop raps combined with Green's helium-pop voice are hardly a match made in heaven.I admit that I detest most hip-hop lyrics as banal and violent. The lyrics here are not especially violent, but not provoking in the least. If you want great Scritti Politti, get Cupid & Psyche."
1,I should have believed the one-star reviews...,"What a drag. I was such a fan, but after ignoring the lesser reviews of the Amazon folk, I bought it anyway. Big disappointment. The only positive thing I can say about Scritti is that their production is still exquisite. But ""you cant make a silk purse out of a sow's ear"" as the saying goes. I hope they do try again soon, and that they bring along some of the songwriting chops Gartside brought to Chaka Khan (he produced a great deal of her more recent stuff) and Meshell Ndegeocello (ditto)."
2,Blech.,"I was one of those longtime fans who anxiously awaited the release of this album, hoping that somehow in ten years Green could culminate the mastery in pop music he was building from Cupid & Psyche through Provision. But Whoa! What a letdown!I know Green tries to encompass modern musical styles in his music, but geez, you hardly hear him sing on this album with all the rapping and stuff. Just about every track sounds the same.The only shining moment on this album is First Goodbye, but it's too reminiscent of Oh Patti from Provision to be considered fresh.Congratulations for trying to break some ground, Green, but you could've done better. I'm gonna pretend Provision was the last album you've done and anxiously await the next one, again."
1,A complete fiasco!,"I've been a Scritti Politti listener from their beginnings, and was looking forward to hearing another album from them after so long. Well, looks like they felt they had to jump on the rap bandwagon and wreck everything. Anomie & Bonhomie is a thorough disaster...six out of the eleven tracks are run-of-the-mill rap, the other tracks are just basically lacking that Gartside snap. When are artists going to realize rap isn't a career saving move and that not all of us even want to hear it! I hope Peter Gabriel learns this after his latest screw-up rap track on his release Ovo. Leave rap to those who do it anyway, so Scritti Politti, please try again and give us what you're normally good at and stop trying to be a part of a trend."
4,Green doesn't disappoint.,After reading the reviews of Anomie & Bonhomie I was reluctant to try it out. I am no fan of rap music and longed for Scritti's pure pop sensibilities. If you're a fan of Cupid & Psyche and Provision then BUY THIS CD. Green hasn't forgotten how to write and David Gamson is still a great producer. The 1st two songs should convince you.Then treat yourself to 'Here Comes July'-worth the price of the CD itself. The rappers actually enhance the songs and without them the album would not be as strong.
2,Review of Lagerfeld for Men Purchase,"We have reason to believe that the Lagerfeld Classic product that we received is a counterfeit product. My husband has been using this product for many, many years and the smell of this product is not right.We are sorry to have to believe this."
1,Looks Good but Defective,"The idea is there but it needs a lot of work still. First off it doesn't keep close when there's pencil in them, make sure you have rubber band wrapped around it otherwise expect to play pick up stick with your pencils. Because of this, I only use it for holding my pencils up so I can get easy access to what I need but then it kept falling forward until i bend it all the way back and have it lean on some books. lol... This product is useless but it has potential if they can fix these issues. lol Oh yah, it does look very professional!"
2,Editor and Publisher Marketplace,"I have no clue why I thought I was getting this book. I guess I thought it might help me look up agents and publishers to send my own work to, but once I looked through it I realized that it was not that kind of book at all. You'd probably have to be in business yourself to understand what the figures mean in practical terms."
5,Swing Trading Made Simple,"Being new to Swing Trading, I found Swing Trading with Oliver Velez very easy to follow and understand. I will definitely be using the tactics that Mr. Velez outlined in the DVD. Would recommend reading Toni Turner's book Beginners Guide to Short Term Trading[...]"
4,So darn funky,"I just discovered Lewis in the past month or so, thanks to Yahoo music. As a person who grew up singing, but has let that talent die as ""real life"" has slowly crept in, Lewis stirs up in me what I've always loved music for. His tight harmonies, complex thumpin bass rifts and complexity of his rhythms are nothing short of amazing. Favorite songs on this CD: Bittersweet and Whoever."
5,"Prince, Stevie & Marvin rolled into one","... the way the songs take you in one direction then midway spin you round and take you off somewhere else and your whole body tingles (yes it lifts the hairs on the back of your neck) I really can't praise this album enough, it's without a doubt one of the greatest CDs Iv ever heard. Yes I know that sounds a bit corny but it really is that good.There's a line in the title track of his 2nd Cd where he says....""I was only trying to make you feel Good, Strange, Different, a Different kind of groove"" ...which says it all!!Lewis Taylor is the best kept secret in music!!"
4,Amazingly gift,"Lewis Taylor is really an amazing ""white guy."" I thoroughly enjoy his arrangement of sounds and vocals. His lyrical content is what's missing from a lot of our current talent options on heavy rotation radio. I highly recommend this album for anyone looking for a sound ride."
4,dvd,"Great! My kids love it! Barney takes each child somewhere like a farm, pizza place, ect. There is lots of singing, dancing, and learning. For kids 2-5 yr.s"
4,Action Packed,"I got this video and it's about Barney taking Baby Bop, BJ, Chip, Keesha, Kristen, and Robert on a bus to imaginary destinations. First it's off to a castle where Robert and Kristen are the king and queen of the land of make believe. Then it's off to a pizzeria for Chip. Next comes a trip to a cowboy ranch for Keesha, then a circus for Baby Bop. And last but not least, BJ becomes a one-man band with Barney's help. This video held my interest until the end credits rolled."
4,Entertaining and creative Barney video,"My son got this video for his 2nd birthday, before which he'd had no exposure to Barney. I reluctantly popped it into the VCR and thereafter it became his favorite video. In it, Barney takes four children on an adventure to a circus, pizza parlor, and corral where they sing various fun and catching songs. Okay, it's a typical Barney video, but the variety of activity in this one makes it a stand-out, plus I believe it introduced some new songs to Barney fans. We still watch it from time to time (2 years later) and recommend it to any preschooler."
2,wow.......?,havent used it yet.. but the box came with a small hole in it.. and when i opened it the label was ripped off most of it.. so now it is a silver cylinder.. i will update when i install tomorrow.
4,Not for a beginner,"I love this book but for the rank amateur it is lacking in one very important area, reading and writing Hangul. To learn to read and write Hangul from this book you would need a Phd in linguistics. However, if you can already read and write in Hangul then this book is for you. It has tons of useful vocabulary and grammar structures which are explained very clearly. Each unit also provides numerous examples and drills which help you master each concept. It is more expenive than other books but it contains more information than any other three books I've seen. After finishing this book, you should be able to express yourself in Korean quite well. If you can't read and write Hangul, I recommend you start with Korean Through English 1 and then come back to this book."
5,The best Korean text available,I used this book in my class for college level. This is simply the best Korean text I ever used. When you go through 4 volumes you really will master Korean. It has a lot of drills.
5,Little River Band-Standing Room Only,This is a 5 star recording! If you have seen them live you will agree!It remainds me of seeing them live and it just brings a smile to my face every time I hear it.
2,Kind of boring,Black Sabbath made a huge impact on the music scene in the 70s which is pretty much similar to their story. The early years was interesting to read about but the later years is just boring.
2,disappointed with this doll,We bought this doll for our daughter. After using the doll in the bathtub for a short period of time the doll started to develop black material (possibly mold) inside the doll. We ended up throwing the doll out.
2,That's One Dirty Doll,"Okay, I would not recommend this doll because she grew black mold inside her suit and around her legs. Yes, she does have a loop so that you can hang her up but she really doesn't get dry. So . . . after a few months, the little lady grew mold. I always squeezed her body so the water would squirt out the holes of her feet to drain her too but I guess we just weren't able to get her dry enough. The mechanism for the shower is very difficult for a young child. It's hard for them to attach the fish to the tube and then squeeze to activate the shower mechanism. Well, the doll now sits in my garage and the fish is a nice chewing toy for my 16 month old daughter."
1,Cute until she get's moldy... (Shower is frustrating.. disappointed),"This doll is cute to look at... until you use it and it begins to grow mold on the material. I took extreme care with this doll and it still grew black spots on the material. My daughter loved having a baby doll in the bath, however, the shower part never stayed together and was just a frustration.I have to replace this doll have only having her for a few months because of the black spots (mold). Maybe I'll try the water baby that got good reviews. Very disappointed in the quality!"
2,TAKES TOO LONG TO DRY!,"My daughter enjoys playing with this doll, both in and out of the tub. The problem is that the doll takes too long to dry out. It takes nearly 2 days hanging before it is completely dry. I find that I have to hide it from my daughter while it dries, otherwise, she ends up wanting to drag a wet baby around the house. So, we rarely put it in the tub. I am sure that it will dry quicker in the summer but until then..."
2,The leg ripped,"My daughter wanted a doll that goes in the water last christmas. I chose this one, and she was so pleased. THe doll is beautiful. She did not quite sit the right way in her raft. Someone needs to hold the raft while the doll is in it, or it will tip. My daugther did not like that we could not just dry the doll off with a towel, so she could take it around the house with her, but that it had to hang and dry. Still she loved this doll and it was her favorite, until two months later when the material around the leg wripped. Instead of trying to sew it, I figured it was cheaply made and the rest would rip also, we said goodbye. This year I am getting her another doll that goes in the bath, but I am getting the Paul Drink and wet doll by corolle. It is a lot more expensive, but I think it will be worth it."
2,terribly boring,"Instructor's voice is not peacecful, and he cannot pronounce the word which I probably cannot spell but have heard many times: ""Namaste."" Poor cinema and sound. Camera angles are not very professional and do not vary much. Check out Rodney Yee's videos and compare. They are much more engaging. I have watched this twice and have no interest in doing it. Time goes slowly. It is very regimented and no fun. After the first session, there is a meditation. The script is good, but who gestures during a meditation? Far to American for this confirmed Anglo! There is a bonus session at the end that gives very good detailed info on proper positioning, but you are asleep or angry by the time you get there."
2,You'll stress with this video,"I love the Yoga Zone series in general, but this particular one completely stresses me out! The instructor is horrible. He overtalks, is way too hyper, and talks more about what NOT to do rather than the correct poses."
1,Too hard on the back and knees,"I am new to Yoga and have done the Rodney Yee back video. It provided great information and gentle exercises which actually helped me. I didn't make it past the first 10 minutes of this video as the poses were much too stressful on the back and knees. No wonder people are sore from using it! Even the modified positions were of no help. There are many other weight loss videos I would recommend before this one, especially if you have a bad back or knees"
1,Yoga Zone for weight loss,"I own 2 Yoga Zone videos, both for beginners. This one, led by Al Bingham, and another, led by Alan Finger. I must say that the tape led by Alan Finger is by far the better video. As a matter of fact I rarely, if ever, workout to the tape instructed by Al Bingham. Alan Finger's tape has a much easier to follow format and a relaxing tone and pace to it. This video was performed on a beach and while beaches are pleasant, I find the beach and Al Bingham distracting and difficult to follow compared to the other video."
3,mediocre,"The workout is good and is a nice medium duration program, in addition to the bonus short program. The flow is challenging enough. The instructor gives good verbal cues, which is really important in yoga because some of the postures do not allow a good view of the TV. I find that Al Bingham, bless his heart, is hard to listen to. Perhaps this is a petty criticism, but he sounds like he's trying really, really hard to be sincere. It's a bit of a turn-off. But, bonus points for the beautiful setting."
4,great for not so limber people,I like this video because is shows the right way to do a pose then the modified say to do a pose. It is easy and there is only 2 people to watch doing the poses and a man talking. I would reccomend this DVD to beginners.
1,A Disappontment,"I loved the first Yoga Zone series. I liked this instructor when I taped several shows from the television series. I found this tape very repetious. I felt like I was doing the same thing over and over and could not wait for the tape to end. I bought this tape based on good reviews from other customers, what a disappointment."
1,Cheap :(,"I bought this for my daughter because the reviews I read here were better than those of other all-in-one kits.I'm so disappointed that I did :(.The charger is beyond cheap and chintzy - it's hard to get the mini-usb plug lined up with the DS's slot, and if you have the strap (a part of this kit) on the DS, it doesn't fit in the charger. I love the light, but it's on all the time and it's BRIGHT.The 3 lens wipers would be great had they not been taped into the package. The tape left residue on the backside of the wipers, which my daughter accidently swiped across the lens protectors, which then had to be thrown away.The game cases hold two games, but there's nothing to hold them into the case, so they just float around.The car charger is a joke. Seriously.Don't waste your money on this!!"
3,"case not very good, but other stuff is","the case zipper broke after two days, and it had a problem of always getting jammed but everything else is fine."
3,DS Lite Accessory Pack,"This is a kit containing accessories for the DS Lite. I don't like it as much as I hoped to, but it's not bad. The adaptors are great and the screen protectors are fine, but the cleaners are not very good and the sack leaves a lot to be desired."
5,FANTASTIC set for a DS LITE,"I am very happy with this purchase, it looks just like the photo, and all the pieces were in the bubble pack, My grandchildren are going to love this come Christmas, and I can't wait to give them this to go along with their DS LITE, LOVE IT"
1,Do Not Buy this for Your Nintendo DS!!,They have these two lumped together but the Nintendo DS does not fit anything in the bundle pack. I am out $30.89.
1,"It was good when it worked, but now...","I bought mine about 6-7 months ago, and it worked great initially. It would cool down to 39 degrees in a few hours. I used it in my office at work. When the temperature would rise, I would hear the fan come on and after a while it would reach the set temperature with no problems.Then, after about 4 months, I noticed the temperature slowly climbing into the 50's, and it has been there ever since. I no longer hear the fan come on as strongly as before. I have tried cycling the power, resetting the temp at 39F but it just won't get any colder than about 50-52F.I called the manufacturer, and the only replacement part that can be ordered is a new power supply. To me, something is wrong with the fan. I guess it could be the power supply, but all of the other functions on the unit seem fine (the internal light, the display). And it heats to 125F with no problems either.I'm going with a Coleman Powerchill 40. Much better name brand."
2,ThermoKool Mr-138,"I purchased this about 6 months ago and this fridge worked great. The size was large enough for many cans of soda. It has a light and the built in thermostat was great. Up until yesterday everything worked great, unfortunately the thermostat starting going crazy and the fridge constantly beeps now and it does not cool or heat anymore because of it. I would say that when it worked it was great but breaking down in such a short time is definite negative."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I bought this mini fridge because the style was cool and compact. Unfortunately, in less than a year it stopped cooling. I paid $35.00 to ship it back and a replacement was sent to me. That one lasted two months. I have had a problem with water pooling on the bottom and now the vent where the cold air comes out is covered in ice. There is no warranty, no list of repair places and no way to contact the company who makes it. Don't wast your money."
4,"USA Reviews Wing to Wing, Oar to Oar 2/10/00","The USA Today review on 2/10/00 was intriguing to me, as it's not the first place I would expect to find support for research that regards traditional relationship models as valid - even right! I have ordered the book, based on the strength of this review and would encourage others to look at it as well. We have lost our way when we do not even mention - let alone mentor - commitment and working through what was once thought to be a life-long relationship. For some of us, it takes that long to grow up... ---as I am one married a mere 28 years can attest..."
1,"Wing to Wing, Oar to Oar: Another Sentence","Amy and Leon do quite a job with traditional texts. It is not an accident that the only evidence for such absurd moral values is found in ancient texts. Ancient texts provide excellent material for modern sociological studies. Fantastic, really. If you take your bearings from the Kasses' book, I would suggest to you that you check out First Things ""the Journal of Religion and Public Life"" and read about the many reasons women should remain demure, submissive and concern themselves above all with finding and keeping an attractive husband. Mmmmmm. God, like Homer works in mysterious ways."
2,Whistle stop,"Didn't close when set down as advertised, and had to be sure to push the handle down to close it. After several months, the whistle no longer whistled, and I nearly set my kitchen on fire, and melted the cover lid with the whistle in it so that it could no longer be opened. Not worth the cost."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I shopped a lot for a new tea kettle. I liked my old one, but I burned it fast to the burner. This kettle is not dainty enough for my liking, the handle and really, the entire design, is big and clunky looking, but I think my ideal kettle does not exist right now. Also, yes, it does open automatically when you lift it, but it is kind of cumbersome. You have to struggle with it to not close when you're trying to fill it through the nozzle and it's inconvenient to fill it through the top opening because the stationary handle is in the way."
1,A poor Happy Day,"Beautiful Church images in the traditional group, however mediocre recordings and only poorly done up-conversions of live performances."
1,Not as described,"I ordered this product, thinking there were six canvases for the price, as the description states ""perhaps best of all, we are offering this in packages of 6"", and the picture shows 6 canvases. This in INCORRECT. If you miss the one line technical description, as I unfortunately did, they only ship ONE canvas for the price. I suggest you save yourself some money and purchase (2) 11x14 canvases at your local Michael's store for $5.99, as opposed to wasting $13 (after shipping) on one measely canvas from this companhy. POOR SELLING DESCRIPTION on the part of this store!!!!!!"
5,Great music but challenging as well,"The Music Minus One title should provide a clue that one of the instruments isn't included on the accompanying CDs. As a classical guitarist, I own many of the MMO collections (""Music Minus One for Guitar"")...they allow me to practice with orchestra accompaniment or flute accompaniment when I'm between practices with another flautist.Some of the pieces are challenging both from note-reading and performance perspectives, so they will work well primarily for advanced intermediate to advanced players."
3,Antiseptic Performances,"Pollini is a great pianist. He has thrilled thousands live and had some magnificent recordings. I did not find this to be an inspirational reading of these pieces. They felt heartless and cold. In comparison, I recently heard the Ballades performed by Murray Perahia on a Sony disk. Check out those recordings because they are rich with expression whereas these Pollini versions are uninvolved. Also, this CD contains only 48 minutes of music, a depressingly low total for CD collectors. There is room for 30 more minutes on this full priced CD. Maybe Pollini did not really have much to say. Please check out the Perahia recording."
3,Excellent recording - but not by Pollini standards,"I own EVERY recording that Pollini has made. He is a master of Chopin - his set of the Preludes, Etudes and Poloniases is a must have in the catalog - a true work of art. BUT since those recordings his Chopin has been lacking something. Don't misunderstand me - his recording are excellent by any standard but not by his. The 4 Ballades recorded on this disc are played wonderfully but they are lacking the energy that Pollini has had in his old recordings. The best piece played on the disc is (in my opinion) the Prelude op. 45. If you don't have a recording of the 4 Ballades - buy Zimerman's recording for DG or Perahia's recording for Sony. I am a Pollini fan and I am hoping that he will soon return to his old self. I read that there is a Diabelli Variations disc and a Schumann disc planned to be released in the near future - I hope they will surpass this recording."
2,Small Rooms ONLY,"I bought this humidifier because I discovered in the apartment I recently moved into, the heat makes the air in the apartment very dry. I wake up every cold morning with a dry mouth and my allergies bothering me.I decided to purchase this for my bedroom just to run at night. My bedroom is probably 20' by 30', not very high ceilings, and even with this humidifier on high all night, I don't notice a difference. Plus, it is very loud on the high setting, almost at loud as an air conditioner. I also have a hard time believing that the tank is really 2 gallons. I haven't measured, but it barely seems 1 gallon in size.It is advertised that it will last 3 full nights per refill, but that is on the low setting, and only if you sleep 6-7 hours a night. I'm sure it may work for a smaller room, probably a good buy for a kid's room, but not for any rooms that are even medium in size. Overall, go for a bigger and quieter humidifier, even if you have to pay a little extra cash."
2,Not best choice,OK for the money but way too noisy and the filters are a hassle...they get full of bacteria and have to be changed every year....spend a little more and get an ultrasonic model.
2,Weak effort from a strong artist,"A collection of pretty lightweight piano pieces with absolutely none of the depth or cohesion of other George Winston collections. Plus, with only about 33 minutes of music its kind of a rip-off. Don't bother with this unless you already have all of his other CDs. But then if you already have all of his other CDs you're going to be pretty disappointed with this one."
1,Yuck..it's smells like bug spray,It smells way more like citronella. I have other bath products with Melissa and they don't smell like this. Uck
5,Love Kneipp,"I love Kneipp Herbal Baths- after experiencing them in Germany years ago, I have been hooked. The scents are marvelous, and even though the cost might be steep for some, the recommended amount to use for each bath can be used - naturally, it's better at the full-strength amount; but even half will allow you to enjoy its therapeutic scent! I've tried the 10 herbal bath products, and I'm going to continue using them for a long time to come!"
5,Great stuff when you have a cold or are feeling under-the-weather.,This bath soak is perfect for when I'm not feeling 100% from sinus problems. The scent is really soothing and makes me feel better after about 15 minutes with this in a hot bath.
1,Does it reflect?,"My first problem with this belt is that it's not reflective all the way around. The adjustable part is just a black belt. Not good if you want to be visible to cars from all sides while running. Also, I have yet to find the ""reflective"" in this reflective belt. Sure, it's silver but that doesn't mean it works. I have many other running items with reflective material, and I can clearly see that the material is reflective. I don't see that with this belt at all. I only hope that people in cars see it, but since I'm not comfortable with hoping that I'm visible while I run, I'm going to buy a different brand."
5,Easy Read,Creative Visualization is very easy to read and understand. I got a lot of useful tools out of this book and am still using the tools!
1,Disappointing,"The book is not a complete waste of time to read, *but* it is a complete waste of your money (perhaps check it out from your local library...).The author is not a professional and doesn't possess any formal or academic background in the field; he is a hobbyist. This is all well and good, but if I want precise information on how to properly care for my snake, it certainly wouldn't be from another hobbyist.Overall, the book does provide decent supplemental information from another hobbyist, but it is certainly not up to being one's primary or sole source of information to caring for your snake. In this respect, it is wholly lacking.If the reader is seeking expert, *qualified* information (and if you genuinely care about your snake), he or she certainly will not find it in this book."
1,May be too soon to tell a difference,"I've used this product for 5 weeks and have noticed a slight lightening, as well as decrease in size of affected area. Will likely re-order at least once to see if improvement continues."
2,proK,"I bought this cream a month before my wedding and used it every day to reduce veins on my cheeks. Did not work. Some say you have to keep using it for several weeks before you see any results, but I gave up."
1,chalky,i would not recommend this product to anyone. It is chalky when applied and i saw no visible results. thanks
2,dont bother,maybe I got a bad batch but itgoes on clumpy doesn't blend into your skinI wasted my money on this product
1,disappointed and disgusted,"I ordered some pro k cream and recieved it about 2 weeks ago. I use pro k cream and have always purchased it from my dermatologist for my facial rosea. I thought that I would look on line to see if I could find it for less and order it directly. What a waste and disappointment. When I opened the jar it appeared only half full but that's just the start of it. Since it is a cream and somewhat dense it should not be able to spill out when you tilt the jar, but it did. When I applied it to my clean face it beaded up and looked like I was shedding dead skin, it was disgusting. Keep in mind that I use this product on a regular basis and it should not be doing this. What a waste of my $'s and time."
3,A Weird TV Show,"It was a weird TV show. A show consisting of many celebrities but ONE gun. It dealt with many murders and crimes.... all dealing with the same gun. From Robert Altman, did you expect less? Now it's on DVD, so have fun with it."
1,No instructions,There is no excuse for not including a manual or instruction sheet. Not even a phone number to call.Could not find manual even at the Bosch Manual site. Does not work or even look like conventional drill chucks. Who needs the hassle?
2,Broke!,"This product seemed fantastic at first, but it only took about 2 hours for the shaft to shear in half."
5,The most clear cut management tool available,"People say that Patton was a man of action. Ridge manages to draw a perfect parellism between what is needed in warfare and what is needed in business. There is a saying ""All is fair in love and war"" I think Ridge just added ""Business"" to that list.Excellent book. A must read for the management professional"
2,Meh,Disappointing mostly remixes and not the Very Best Of in my book. You'll be better served buying the CD reissues of original albums.
1,Don't be deceived,"While the description for this product states that it is the 50th Anniversary Bucket, it is in fact just a plain old bucket of LEGOs.The Anniversary bucket should be black with a gold top and say 50th Anniversary on the side. The #4105 bucket you will receive is just a plain red bucket with no special pieces."
3,deception,"I purchased thinking it was volume 1, and volume one is great, this volume 2 is not as good"
4,Ladd's final hour,"This is the sort of thing that Alan Ladd did best in his heyday - fast moving, action-packed adventure with smart dialogue and a colorful supporting cast.His old buddy Lloyd Nolan is a great foil for the hero. Unfortunately for Ladd it was all downhill from here!"
2,Disappointment,"Alan Ladd is stone-faced as usual.I was looking forward to seeing the beautiful Rosanna Podesta, whose good looks in "" Helen of Troy "" have never left my mind. But in this film she does not look beautiful at all. What a disappointment.One more word about Mr. Ladd. I have seen practically all his films, and the one in which he really acted well was ""The Carpetbaggars"", as a supporting lead to George Peppard.SS."
4,Old Fashioned Sci-Fi,"This was written in the 50's I am thinking, where the use of Nuclear bombs is considered normal. Its still a well written story and fun to read. The characters are well defined and the plot good. Definetly an good read for an afternoon."
2,Beware!,This is the female type of plug. My camera originally came with the male version. The website doesn't do a good job of letting you know this. Now I have to buy a converter!
4,Not quite what I expected - but good,"This disc should be named The Ponga Remix Album, because that is what it is. It may not say that on the disc (it has no liner notes at all), but if you drop it in a computer or look on its web page, there it is. I bought it for the Amon Tobin track (he only does one), but the rest of it is good too. The disc flows along from a soft jazzy start to the powerful Tobin track and then slowly slides back to the same mellow sound it starts with. A good album overall, but don't buy it thinking the whole thing was done by Amon Tobin. I would however recommend it. I have owned it for nearly a month and it has not left my music rotation yet."
3,This is NOT an Amon Tobin album!,Amon Tobin only remixed one of the tracks. This is a collection of Ponga material remixed by various artists. It's hit and miss.
4,Good,"This unique album contains enything you want, except heavy and hard. Here we have drum'n base, jungle, jazz, ets. I can recommend it for all fans of electronics. Get this album and remember that it's a bargain. For example in Moscow I've seen this CD for 27 USD."
3,Requested Review,"While I found the book useful as an adjunct to the novel, I misconstrued the information at time of ordering and thought I was ordering the novel... until it arrived. Actually it was very helpful by providing critical insights beyond my reading ability."
2,It could have been a contender,"Since purchase, it can hardly handle two WANs of different speeds. No direct physical port to WAN and QOS is a joke. SO I had to leave the VoIP before this device. I have DSL and Cable services since both go down randomly all the time. This device should have been able to deal with it. But the CPU gets hung often in a health check failure. If you don't have a health check, it doesn't know the service is dead and will continue to push towards a dead WAN. The only thing I use this for is a easy way to manually switch what service is primary. And even that requires a re-boot. It's like the O/S was written by Microsoft. Support - What support. You bought it, your stuck with it."
1,WARNING!,My Xincom router(s) lock up periodically!The Xincom corporation seems to have largely shut down.Their corporate phone number is not answered and all voicemail boxes full.Technical Support cannot assist their customers and can't seem to contact corporate.
1,not worth the money,this dual wan router is not worth the money. i tried using it with a cable and a dsl modem and it did not split the bandwidth between them. the reason i bought it was becasue i have 6 playstations online and 4 computers online i thought it would give me greater bandwidth. well not true because you need more upload speed rather than download speed and it can only go as fast as your isp lets u. so if u are a gamer online its not worth it. i returned it to amazon for refund. instead of buying this product i just made 2 different networks one for computers and one for the playstations.
1,Mediocre product; NO customer support,"The product worked -- marginally -- for a few weeks after I purchased it. I've had several dual-home routers, and the only thing this one has going for it is that the firmware is easier to use than most. However, when it stopped functioning (i.e., turned into a paperweight), their tech-support department wouldn't even pick up their phone. The only exception was on about my 10th call over a three-week period, when someone finally picked up and then slammed the phone back down without even saying hello. They also ignored RMA requests sent via email and fax. I'm not sure whether they're bankrupt or just without any customer service department, but what good is a warranty when no one will respond to your exchange/RMA requests? STAY AWAY!!!"
3,Its working now...,Had to reinstall the original firmware although I hadn't done anything to it?? Not a fan of just 45 days tech support either. Now that its working I'm pleased. Not for faint hearted non geeks.
2,does not work with tritton ax 720s,"i bought this to replace the wire that goes from my tritton ax 720's to my xbox controller. the 720's use a 3.5 port and the xbox controller uses a 2.5, so its hard to find the right cable. this one fits, but going into the controller is real loose and gives off alot of static if moved at all. not recommended for tritton users"
5,Cable works great for my headset.,"I bought this cable for use with my new Gears of War 3 Tritton 7.1 surround sound headset. The cable the headset came with did not fit into my Razer Onza. I tried grinding down the plastic, but the tip of the audio plug came off. I bought this cable and after it arrived, I plugged it in and it worked with no issues. Audio quality sounds perfect and I my voice goes through cleanly."
5,Very Worth It,"I use this cable to connect the not-so-standard headphone jack on the Treo 650 with the auxillary jack in my car so that I can play MP3s from my Treo over my car speakers. There isn't much to say about such a simple piece of hardware other than it works, is solidly constructed and I haven't had any difficulty with it."
3,good but wasn't what I was looking for,"I got this thing for my px5 turtle beach headset to connect to my laptop. It send audio nicely to the headset. The only downside, I don't know if it is the headset or the cable, but when I turn my head to look around the room, the cable would rotate and cause static in the headphone or come a bit loose. I'm always having to reseat it when that happened.the other annoying thing is, no fault to this cable, is that the px5 turtle beach has a auto-shut off feature when it doesn't get any signal. This cable does not signal the px5 that it is getting signal and power down every 5 minutes."
1,SLOW!!,"Oredered the thing 4 days ago and they still havnt sent it, do not use these guys if you need something fast"
5,WOW!!!!!!!! AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!,"This film is a royal treat. It's captivating low budget production, terrible acting, Hogan's stunt double needed for running scenes, and EXPLOSIONS!!! make this film a must have for any 'true' movie fan."
3,Small but interesting and only $1.00,This is a 16 page book or iron on transfers. Most pages have multiple designs on a page. There is one mask. Several pages have designs that could be used for borders on a garment. It is well worth a $1.00.
4,Works well,"I use Stinging Nettle Root in combination with Saw Palmetto extract, and it works great. I would not recommend using just Stinging Nettle, but would ADD it to Saw Palmetto ""EXTRACT"".Do NOT use saw palmetto ""BERRIES"" or ""Whole Herb"" or ""Whole Berry"" or ""Whole Fruit"". It NEEDS to say either - Standardized or Extract and should have 360mg per 1 capsule."
4,Seems good,"I take combined Pygeum & Saw Palmetto + Pumkin seed Oil + this prod, and it stops the piss running down my leg."
2,"Poorly written, what was the publisher thinking?","[...] This book is poorly written. [...]I am not sure if the publisher left it as-is thinking that its bad writing might somehow relate to people, but it was the wrong choice. While I don't agree with the message this book delivers, and I don't agree with the 'author' in general, the editor/publisher of this book should have made it an actual book instead of a paper blog."
1,Poorly Written,"This book was very poorly written. Not only is it full of grammatical errors, but the arguments don't make sense. The facts haven't been well-checked, either. She cites several urban legends that even the mainstream media has disproven.If you want good liberal books, don't waste your time with this one. Read someone who helps the cause, not hurts it."
1,"Stalk a movie star, you go to jail; stalk the President",". . .and you become a media sensation. Such is the mainstream media's clout -- and its hypocrisy.Cindy Sheehan and her ilk are also ignorant of history. In 216BCE, at the Battle of Cannae, the Romans lost 50,000 soldiers to Hannibal and his army from Carthage, whom the Romans had outnumbered. This is roughly the number of soldiers we lost in the entire Vietnam war; despite losing that many men in one day, Rome didn't give up. They refused to surrender because no one in Rome shared Cindy Sheehan's philosophy. Those who did back then lived in Carthage; that's why we learned about the Roman Empire, and not the Carthagenian, when we went to school.This silly, illogical rant is a testament to the intellectual and moral bankruptcy of the ""peace"" movement. Its release gives aid & comfort to our enemies. So does buying it, and so does giving it five stars."
1,Sad and Deceitful,"There have been far more reviews than the 22 listed here but they keep getting removed. They weren't offensive but they do question Ms. Sheehan's motives and methods. There is even one review that threatens anyone who doesn't agree with them (""I have a list of names!""--whatever that means).There's a great book on Cindy Sheehan but it hasn't been written yet. This poorly-written screed certainly isn't it.I sympathize with her grief but the more I see of Cindy--all smiles with Susan Sarandon about the movie of her story (which will probably never materialize), rolling on the grave of her dead son for a photo op, calling for the USA to abandon Israel and end the occupation of New Orleans--the less I see of a stable woman."
1,read it base your own opinion.,poorly written and a slap in the face to all who currently serve in the military. Basically telling us we have no common sense and that we are evil becuase we love being in the military. Believe it or not being in the military isnt about politics even in war we dont give a crap about it only our brothers and sisters in arms. Read this book please then make your opinion.
2,Garbled message,"Ms. Sheehan's story is obviously one of deep pain and sorrow. I approached this book hoping to hear some resolution for her pain. I was pleased to see that she managed to work in some light-hearted moments, so maybe in time, she will bring back at least some of the joy she lost when Casey died.But this book is a literary mess! She badly needed an editor to step in and organize the book so that it loses its ""stream of consciousness"" feel. The grammatical errors caused me to wince more than once and I had a bad case of ""MYGO"" (My eyes glazing over) when she spouted more of the tired lines about the war.As a memoir it has some definite value; as a work of literature, not there for me."
5,Required reading for all Americans,"Before this book, Cindy Sheehan was just another face flashed on my television screen. This book brought her to life in a very compelling way. I'm a right leaning moderate who is becoming very jaded with the deceit of the Bush Administration and Sheehan's book really provided alot of clarity [...]."
5,A New Classic of American Patriotism,"Cindy Sheehan's passionate, clear, and courageous book, Not One More Mother's Child, instantly deserves a place alongside other classics of American Patriotism such as Tom Paine's ""Common Sense,"" Henry David Thoreau's ""On Civil Disobedience,"" and Martin Luther King's ""Letter from the Birmingham Jail."" [...] For anyone with even a slightly open mind, or who is beginning to question, this book will help make the point. I will say about her maligned writing style, that Cindy Sheehan does not speak as an historian, or as one of those journalists or pompous pundits who depend on authorized insider government sources. Rather, Cindy speaks as a sincere, ordinary concerned citizen, and as a mother, but one who will not accept anything less than the truth from our government. This book should be required reading for all concerned American citizens."
4,Shoulder brace review,"This is a great device to help reminder where your shoulders should be. It's a little hard to wear next to bare skin, but over a shirt is OK. This suited my purposes perfectly."
3,Okay for what it is.,"I recently purchased this item fully realizing that it would not work as well as a more supportive brace that fits around the shoulders and the waist. I have a problem with tight clothing around my waist and realized that, while it would probably be superior, the larger unit would not work for me. I spend a lot of time at a computer and have seen that it has taken its toll on my posture. Basically, I feel that this brace is serving more as a reminder than a physical support. I would suggest that it be worn over a piece of clothing as opposed to directly on the skin as it can chafe."
1,DId nothing for me.,Did nothing for me. I was so willing to return this item but lazy me got past the return window. I don't recommend this product.
1,waste of money,"Way too large for a 5'2"" woman who wears M size clothing. doesn't really pull the shoulders back even when pinned back with safety pins to fit. waste of money."
2,OUCH!,"This brace is painful!! I tried it over clothes, and it still dug into my skin. I then sewed on some sweatshirt material over it to make it softer, and it still leaves a red rim under my armpit. I have not found a way to be able to wear it. So for me it was a waste of money."
4,More Overview Maps Needed,"The descriptions, color photos, and maps for the hikes are good. The weakness is that while the book is divided into 10 geographic sections, it lacks a map for each of these sections. For example, if you're considering hiking in the Central Cascades, it would be useful to study a map that locates all the hikes in the Central Cascades section of the book."
2,Returned due to authors elitist attitude,"While the photos and information in this book may be good, the authors elitist attitude toward other trail users put me off to such a degree that I returned it."
3,Nice Tool!,"The Palm V has been a terrific tool for keeping names, addresses, phone numbers, appointments and other information I need to keep with me. I like the way it fits into my pocket, but would like a thin protective case that's not bulky. I disagree with the comment about visibility in low light. It's not easy to view. Even in normal lighting conditions, I find myself shifting it around to find the right angle where it's visible without a lot of reflection. Still, overall, it's pretty great."
5,A stunningly insightful retro classic,"The Omnibus of Fun is a serious 'study' piece conducted by the Eisenbergs (from the YMCA!) intended to be a true encyclical of games for American youths. Unfortunately, or perhaps most fortunately, the book hasn't aged well and reads as a dated, moralistic, and politically uncorrect joke-piece straight from the dusty library shelves. And it is for this reason alone that I can heartily recommend it to anyone looking for nonstop laughs-- Suggestions of things to do with your date is perhaps the funniest section; but the suggested skits, jokes, and reading sections are equally bizarre... You may even want to try out some of these ideas for the sheer embarassment of it...one wonders if such monstrously oddball activities were ever actually inflicted on kids in the 50s...if so, I can only begin to think what delightful damage it did to a whole generation!--Justin Laird Weaver"
1,"Speedo aqua fit barbells, charcoal/ red",The barbells take in water that is then traped in the bar. It is difficult to drain but u must do so or have water leaking all over the place. This will make me have to stretch the bar and make them break much faster than they should. I have used many types in the past and have never has this problem. All 4 barbells did the samething.
2,Only lasted one season,"Didn't last very long..only one season. I have to purchase a new pair for this summer. Will try a different brand.The Red plugs on the side of the barbells kept popping off, it was very annoying."
2,Aqua barbells hold water and ends fall off,Had to return most of the Speedo Aqua Fitness Barbells. They look good and have a good resistance however the end caps are not secure. The barbells hold water and then leak all over during storage and many of the end caps have cracked and fallen off. The plastic end cap and the plastic it connects to are of very poor quality.
3,Disappointed,"After only a few weeks of use and outside the window to be able to return the product, one of the red caps cracked and fell off making half of the set unusable. Loved them while the set lasted. Are replacement caps available? If so, Seller please contact me."
1,Pool Weights,I'm unhappy with my purchase of pool weights. My weights fall apart in the pool. They shouldn't do that.
2,Heavier than I thought,These weights are heavier than I was used to.l there should be some info about how heavy they are. I bought the mid weight ones.
4,Exactly What I needed,I bought this item in February of 2012 and they're still going strong. I uses these in my aqua aerobics class as they offer more resistance than the silly plastic ones the gym uses. These are perfect for my fitness level (begin/medium) and they've really held up well with several uses a week in a chlorinated pool.
5,Good workout aid & great color,"I use these in my water exercise class, and have been very happy with the quality, and the greater level of water resistance these provide than provided by the aqua barbells at the facility. Love the color. Seems like lots of folks have these, but many more in the blue and white than charcoal & red. I too, had the issue of water leaking from the handles when I was done. However, I'm now sure that I set them on end when I am done, and the water seems to drain out fairly quickly."
3,So-so product,"The Speedo aqua fitness barbells are a bit disappointing. They tend to come apart quite easily, which is frustrating when you're in the middle of a workout. The red caps come off and then the foam weight. The red cap fits only a certain way onto the barbell, so if you try to fix it fast, the piece cracks. They do the job, they're just not very durable. Hopefully, I will get at least this summer season out of them."
3,OK but are starting to loosen up,I like these but after a couple of months use some play is showing up in the end floats. Still work but wonder what another few months of heavy use will do? Also hold water in the handles which is hard to get out... I have to lay them out to drain for a number of hours.
5,These are great!,"They are made very sturdy, they're nice looking and I am very pleased with them. They work very well in the water."
4,Good barbells,"The barbells were a good product, excellent for water aerobics. They were more dense than others I have used and were more resistent providing more muscle during the exercises."
2,Disappointed in Quality,"I do a hour of water aerobics one to two times a day and this product is already taking on water as well as distracting me by the the large ""weight"" parts of the aqua barbells moving around while I'm working out. I've just been using them a little over a month and they seem to be falling apart. I did not order the brand that I was looking into ordering because these were a little cheaper. I had seen they were a Name Brand- Speedo, I thought they would be similar in quality to the Aqua Fitness Barbells that I had been using and they were not. I'm very disappointed in the generic quality of this product when I paid for and expected name brand quality."
3,Decent weights,"These are a good size and provide moderate resistance, but water fills the hollow bar between the dumbells. They don't dry easily and the water leaked all over thetrunk of my car when I brought them home from the pool . If you're just using them at home they would be fine"
2,disappointed,"barbells fell apart the 1st time we used them.. when I get around to it, I will try glueing the ends on,"
3,a bit flimsy,It really wouldn't take much more plastic or cost to make this a better item. They do their job but could be made better.
1,I only received ONE barbell. NOT A PAIR.,"I do not know if this is false advertising, poor product packaging, or just an ""oops"" moment when this product was packaged---but I thought I was purchasing ""barbells"" (plural), rather than paying so much for a single barbell.The picture and the product name shows two barbells. However, the unopened box I received via UPS only contained a single Barbell.However, the single weight appears to work well. Unfortunately, I have to find another of the same size to get a decent workout. . ."
5,Water Weights,This product is fun and easy to use. It replaced milk jugs and is much easier to hold on to and manipulate. They are used in my water aerobics class.
5,Great Book,This is the best book you will ever read in your life. It lays down the solid facts like no other book EVER. Edwin Nutbrown is the smartest man alive!
4,An excellent primer on Shamanism,"I really enjoyed this book. I also recommend it to my Shamanic Healing students. Though the Matthews' have a background in Celtic Shamanism, practitioners of all paths will find this book useful. This book covers all the important aspects of Shamanism from spirit helpers to soul retreival and divination. I highly recommend it!"
4,excellent book - best read with a buddy or in a group,"I have been a spiritual seeker for all my life. Now in my 50's I got into a group of 6 people with a teacher and we read this book. My spiritual journey has been absolutely revolutionized - having a spirit guide (or two or three or more!!!) can teach you things that are SO perfect for you, that you could never hire a counselor who would have the wisdom to know. I gave it 4 stars only because I don't know how I would have gotten through it without a group of people. This book will introduce you to the three spiritual realms: the underworld, middle world and upper world, and your personal spirit guides and power animals that will guide you through each and protect you. It's like taking a brief tour of a whole new continent - that you know you need to come back and explore endlessly."
3,Not as advertised,The cookie mix I received with this kit indicated that it expired in December 2007- a bit disappointing considering this was a christmas gift (2008)! Please also be aware that the apron pictured is not included in this set. The cookie sheet and utensils however are of great quality.
1,Christ on a cracker!,"Oh sweet jesus. This book is, possibly, the worst ever written. Just don't read it okay? It's not even ""so bad it's funny."" It's just...bad."
1,Worst Book Ever,"Don't buy this.But if you do, I dare you to try to get more than 10 pages in without peeing your pants from laughter."
1,Is there any way to give this book less than one star?,"Okay, I'm guilty of one thing and that was reading the reviews first and wanting so badly to read this terrible book myself. When I started the book I liked to think of my self as a sane person, I no longer think that...This book is terrible. The first two reviewers are horrible, horrible people. I don't understand how anyone could enjoy such a ghastly book.To the writer: Cease and Desist, for the love of God or Satan...Hell doesn't even want you after this book."
1,A Novel of Hope,"Because of this book I have a new optimism towards the future. I now know, no matter what total piece of garbage I vomit on paper, I can get it published. Thank you, Aaron."
1,avoid this book at all costs,This is a book lovers worst nightmare. Avoid at all cost.PS: did anyone bother to spell check this book before it was published
1,What on earth...,"Aside from the terrible quality of this work, why the heck is it so expensive? The price tag on it makes it practically a crime.But what an excellent gift for someone you dislike! :)"
1,Miserable excuse for a book,"I decided after reading the adoring reviews of everyone to try to read it since the first few pages are conveniently available online.I got half-way though the second page.It's a book about tools. That's basically it. If you're into stories about the stereotypical college frat boy...please, read on. If you're one of the more intellectual of our race..run away. Far away."
1,It does have a use actually,"If you cut this up into sheets and hang this on a nail in your toilet, you will never be caught short when you run out of the soft stuff and you will have found the right use for this 'book'.And there is a certain synergy with the current and intended contents...Tweedy"
2,Tough read,"Tough read. Interesting story for a book, but the execution could have been better. I like what the author was trying to do - perhaps it is ""experimental"" - but he suffers from lack of editing in both content and copy. I feel guilty writing this review as I really only read 25% of the book - I just kept cringing and skipping pages."
1,The Shadow God,"I only read the sample pages, but from that I know this book deserves one star. Less then one star would be best, unfortunately Amazon does not allow for .2 star reviews. The only reason this book would get a .2 star is that it can technically be read. The sentences just do not flow together instead you get a lot of sudden stops. So very very bad."
1,Maybe Amazon SHOULD turn off buy buttons!,"SWEET MOTHER OF MERCY!I couldn't even finish the sample pages. You know, I got all up in arms when Amazon started their little power play to turn off the buy buttons for some POD publishers. However, in the case of AuthorHouse novels like this one--PLEASE, IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS: AMAZON, TURN OFF THIS BUY BUTTON!!You risk rotting the brains of those who somehow make the mistake of buying and reading this unadulterated dreck. And people with rotted brains don't buy many books. (They spend a lot of time playing video games, but that's another story.)"
5,Amazing watch for the price,I have been wanting this watch for some time. Great watch. You won't be disappointed. The lume on this watch is great also
3,"Authentic, but bad band.","The watch is good, but the metal band is a very bad match for such a large watch. The first two rings that hold the watch to the rest of the band continually bend."
3,"Ok watch, not great","On the positive side, I like the looks of the watch. On the other hand, there are 2 major drawbacks in my opinion: 1) the jubilee bracelet and clasp feel very cheap and flimsy (note: I usually wear oyster bracelets) 2) the screw down crown is not very smooth.I haven't had it long enough to gauge accuracy. I am keeping the watch, but almost returned due to the bracelet. Fortunately, there are numerous options for a replacement."
4,Solid timepiece and a handsome accessory,"Classic design, comparatively accurate (mine is gaining about 5-10 seconds a day, depending on storage position) and a thrifty choice. Much to my chagrin, I get a lot more compliments from strangers on this watch (who presume I spent an order of magnitude more) than any of my far pricier watches. Originally, I bought this as a daily beater to alternate out with my solar atomic G-Shock but it quickly replaced it as my primary casual wear watch.One star off because the jubilee band that comes with it feels pretty cheap band with hollow links. I personally dislike the jubilee style anyway, as I find it too gaudy, so I planned on replacing it with a NATO strap from the outset, which looks quite sharp with the Seiko.In conclusion, while you won't be impressing anyone who turns their nose up at anything less than a Patek, the SKX007 offers good looks and functionality at a screaming deal - just don't expect the factory bracelet to be Tiffany."
3,Good watch but lack of warranty....,"Purchased this watch and was satisfied with it until it began to stop after 3 days. Had to take it to a certified Seiko watch repair shop and was advised if I received a Seiko warranty card with the purchase. Unfortunately, I did not and the repairman gave me some slack. It is an original watch but the packaging was not. Even the instructions were actually copies of the original. Good watch but make sure you get a Seiko lifetime warranty card."
5,Seiko Diver SKX007,"This is a very solid timepiece, worthy of costing 3 times as much. I've owned quite a few divers in my time, and none compare to the quality and build of these Seiko Divers. Get one - you will not be disappointed."
2,Nice looking but is not accurate,"This is a great looking watch. Very durable and I like that the front face is flat, minimizing scratches. In addition, it has a very clean look which allows the wearer to quickly glance and observe the time. However, about 2 years into ownership, the watch started to run fast, by a few mintues a day. I sent it back to Seiko for repair (US Customer service center in NJ) and it appeared as if the problem was fixed. However after about a year, the watch now runs close to 40-50 minutes fast PER DAY. As nice as it looks, a watch has to tell time correct. This one didn't after a while; be wary when purchasing."
2,Runs way too fast.,"This is a really nice solid watch - looks and feels great (gets compliments from time to time).Some reviewers have commented on the lightness of the strap. They are right, it feels a little weird at first to have a light strap and heavy watch. Don't worry, you'll get used to it very quickly.However, after about a year of use with no problems, suddely the watch started running fast. Now it's usual that automatics run a little fast, but this is ridiculous - 20 minutes per day.Being up to 20 minutes out on any given day simply isn't acceptable. There's no way I'd use it as a dive watch - wouldn't trust it to tell me whether there was gas left in my tanks. I sent it back to seiko - who serviced it and there has been no improvement. Time to send it back again...Worth buying anyway because of it's great look and feel, but you'd be gambling that you get one which doesn't run fast."
1,"I like the watch, but...","One of the spring bars that came installed is a common thin one, not the thick original it should be. So it rattles very much, the bracelet is loose, and it just feels insecure in my wrist. Can't use it because it feels like the spring bar is going to break and come apart and the watch is going to fall to the ground at any time.Now I have to pay for spring bars and have then installed."
2,Bi Lingual Day Reading,"Just sent the watch back. The ""day"" reading is bilingual (spanish/english). Not something I want or need. The display needs to be set on either language, but because the day reading must flip past the spanish it first shows the spanish day (at midnight) and then does not switch to the english day until about 3am. This is not something that has any value for me and since I am often up past midnight its kind of useless. Seiko was simply trying to save money by engineering one watch for two languages, but failed as the display is a clumsy attempt."
1,"Really bad service, watch nice","since i got the watch is being slowing down (loose like an hour every day), i tough it was me (the watch works with your movement) that i wasn't using it enough, finally i contact the seller and they ask me to pay for shipment (fine) PLUS 20 dlls to get it shipped back!!!!!!!!!, they receive it 11 days ago (i have the confirmation) and no word from them!!i like the watch, but the seller is not committed to the costumer.update: i just got this answer...""According to our system we have not yet received your watch for repair. Can you please provide us with the tracking number you used to send the watch back to us? This will help in locating your package.""thanks god i paid delivery confirmation.."
1,Not good at all,"This is, for our family, a high priced gift. It does not work. We did not realize it was coming from China. This is an expensive mess."
2,No mapping capability at all...,"Just keep in mind that if you buy this product, you will not have the capability to load any Mapsource data, or any map data at all. The unit does not come with even a rudimentary database, and although there is an optional (and riduculously overpriced) PC interface cable, you won't be able to upload anyting into the GPS unit. No street maps, no topo maps,... nada. Other comparably priced units have this capability, which seems to me to be absolutely essential if you actually want to use a GPS unit to be able to navigate, which, let's face it, is the only reason that you would buy one."
1,NO GPS UNITS,I AM STILL WAITING TO RECEIVE THE TWO GPS UNITS I ORDERED ON 9-25-08I SURE HOPE TO HAVE THEM BY XMAS !!
4,Amazing Technology but ...,"My eyes were wide the first time I turned on this unit. I couldn't believe that it was talking to satellites in space.The up side: It is fun technology! I've enjoyed having this unit on my bike. It's actually replaced my bike computer, because it gives far more and greater information during the ride. The down side: I have been disappointed with it's performance hiking. Under heavy forest canopy and deep mountain valleys (typical trail conditions in the Pacific Northwest), it has a very difficult time finding the satellites.The pluses outweigh the minuses on this one. Just don't expect miracles on the trail."
3,"Great GPS, less accurate than I would like",This GPS is a great help for any kind of GPS work you would need to do that didn't require you to be any closer than about 20 feet. Within 20 feet is is inprecise.I've found that the altimeter needs regular calibration to be accurate as well.Too bad it doesn't come standard with an A/C adapter. You'd think with all the money you're paying the least you would get is an A/C adapter!
4,very good reading,I like the way it has all the action and it is writen I will read it again It is so enjoyable
4,great new music,"Generally I am not a fan of compilations. But while in a record store in Austin, I figured why not? I couldn't find anything else new, the price was good, and I love In the Nursery and Ikon.So, I have to say the reviewer from Gothic Paradise got it right. There is a lot of great new material and new groups on this disk. And I especially like the fact the compilation gives a mix of tunes without simply sticking to goth, ebm, industrial, etc. Finally someone understands people's tastes are wide spread and a lot of us aren't caught up in forcing ourselves into one style. This is a good purchase if you crave new music."
5,Melitta Coffee filters,The product #1 Melitta Coffee Filters worked great. My mother was very happy with the gift. She has been using then in her 1 cup coffee maker.
5,Greatly overpriced,I purchased these filters as part of a gift and found that they cost more than twice what I pay at the grocery storefor mine. I use the same ones for my own one cup coffee pot. Needless to say I was very disappointed at the price.I gave the product 5 stars because the filters are good.
5,Good little filters! Cheaper at your local store.,"Natural brown coffee filters make a good cup of coffee; pure coffee taste and no grounds or silt at all. If you live in southern California, your local Albertson's might carry it. That's where I got mine for $2.79 for this 40 count box."
5,Good Little Filters,These are good filters. I use them with the Black 'n Decker Brew & Go coffee maker and they work great.
3,I can buy size #2 filters and cut to fit,"These filters fit my coffeemaker. However, I think the item is overpriced when you add the cost of shipping. For $2.59 at my local drug store, I can purchase 40-count #2 size Melitta filters and cut them to fit. And why does the seller send via FedEx? It's ridiculous to have to be home to take delivery of such a small package. What's wrong with using the USPS?"
4,A good application,I have been using these filters in my Brew-And-Go for years and it provides a very satisfactory quality of my coffee.
3,Review of The Turn to Biographical Methods in Social Science,"The Turn to Biographical Methods in Social Science provides the reader with issues of methodology and theory and examples of biographical methods in use. In general, I found the chapters on methodology and theory to be both useful and clearly written. This was especially true of Case histories and families and social processes (Chpt. 3.) However I was a bit disappointed with the second part of the book that provides examples from biographical research. In my opinion, the cases chosen for the book will be of less interest to researchers and students working outside of Europe, and specifically, outside of Germany. For a wider take on biographical methods, I would recommend The Oral History Reader (Perks & Thomson, eds.)."
2,ok,"service is great from store, but the book wasn't great...not laura ingalls wilder's best work. there are better fairy poems"
5,What a wonderful surprise!,"This is some of the wittiest songwriting I've come across in years! My favorites are different than the other reviewers; Baby Blue, Find Your Way Home, Up All Night; but I agree that the entire collection is way above average. This CD has become my new touchstone for de-stressing that drive home. I also am sharing this with anyone who'll listen. What a huge oversight that a major label hasn't picked this guy up!"
1,"lacks accuracy, poorly written","I was excited when I saw this title on the shelf. However, after I read the first few pages. I was disapointed. Inaccuracies abound, like when the author states the kill ratio of migs to f-86s as 7 to 1. Postwar records from the former Soviet Union show that the ratio was more like 3 to 1. Inaccuracies in the photographs state f-84s as f-94s ect. However, the work would still be acceptable if not for the poor writing style of the author. When recounting the first hand stories of aces, I found I had to read them three times to get any clear picture of what is going on. Perhaps she was using the words of the probably 70+ year olds which could add to the problem.If you like first hand muddled accounts of the air war in korea, this book is for you, but if you want more detailed accounts of tactics and exploits ect. you will need to look elsewhere."
4,Too heavy if you have arthritis,We bought this teapot for our Aunt who is suffering with arthritis because there are not buttons you have to push to open the lid. It turned out to be much heavier than her old Corelle teapot so she is not using it.The way the lid opens (without buttons)is way cool. You just tilt the teapot like you were going to pour and it flips open. We really like the teapot and the quality. It's just a little heavier than we would have liked.
1,Disappointed,"Long delay in shipping (2 months!) and the spout cap has broken twice in the first five months with only light use by my Mom, a petite grandmother. Sending it in again for another lousy fix isn't an appealing option. I'll look for another brand. Too bad it's crappola, I'm told the design is pretty handy when it isn't broken. Sorry OXO."
4,"Heats fast, light weight, but uneven pour","This is the smaller Oxo kettle. It's just the right size for boiling up to 32 ounces of water, very quickly. Has a clear whistle so you know when the water's boiling. I like its design and light weight; the heavy enamel finish makes it easy to clean with just a swipe of a clean wet cloth. It's nicely balanced for pouring, better even than the big Oxo kettle. But unlike its big brother, it splatters the hot water as I pour it out. It's not a danger, just a nuisance. I mostly use it to pour boiling water into a Melitta filter to make a cup of drip coffee, so I have to clean up the splatter from the counter and the kettle. That keeps me from giving it the fifth star."
2,Spout broke after 6 months,"The kettle should have last for a long time, especially for its price range.This should not be a cheap kettle, but it seems only the price says so.The spout broke after 6 months, without any extreme use. The usage was just for boiling water for coffee and tea for breakfast, nothing like using 3-or-more times a day.Another thing I noticed was the enamel inside and seemed to get corroded, exposing the steel.I would not recommend this product to anyone."
5,Business aspects of Contracting made easy!,"Finding Hidden Profits has taught me how to improve my management methods so that my contracting business and clients are controlled by me, not the other way around. Dixon has some good insights & tips, on making sure your customers are happy and understand things that are included and NOT included in their building project.Allowances and Change Orders are big problems in the building business. Dixon shows methods of making these processes simple and profitable.This book has the ""inside scoop"" for contractors.(Anonymous) A Grateful Builder!"
5,Excellent information!,"Dennis Dixon is an outstanding counsel and very helpful, personable, knowledgeable and accessible. The book, his articles in Journal of Light Construction and his contract are extremely valuable to people working in the construction business."
5,A DC Legend's take on Christmas,"I DON'T understand anyone's disappointment that Eva Cassidy is only on two tracks here. It is a Chuck Brown album, NOT an Eva Cassidy album. I'm a big fan of both, (Their album together, ""The Other Side"" is one of my favorites). This is mostly Chuck doing the Go Go thing and nobody does it better. He slows it down on a couple of tunes, (and quite admirably I might add), but it's mostly a groovin' good time. As for Miss Cassidy's contributions, they are great, (and she is one of my favorite all time singers). Their take on ""The Spirit of Christmas"" even surpasses the superb Ray Charles original, (from my ""other"" favorite Christmas album, ""The Spirit of Christmas"", by Ray Charles."
1,Spirit without soul,This cd lacks all the feeling that other versions of these songs have. I sounds like overproduced karaoke.
5,Ordered twice,"I actually ordered it twice for my Maxima after the first one fell off on the highway. Its a good fit for the Injen intake, but you have to make sure the area is clean and you tighten it as much as you can. Use another hose clamp if you have to. The first time I received this, it had a shiny red cap with an inner conical area like in the sub pics and the second time it had a flat black cover with no inner cone like in the ad's pic."
3,To much Background,"I enjoyed this book but I did think he talked a little to much about his struggles to get sponsorship and not enough about his sailing. The sailing parts of the book were the most interesting because he always seems to be pushing his boats to the limit. Which in turn he seems to always almost sink them. So for his next book , which will be coming out I'm sure after his around the world race in 2001, more sailing less background."
1,How did this guy get a book contract???,"This book is beyond inept. Goss takes what could be an exciting story and makes it into an endless parade of money troubles and ""pip pip"" British posturing. How did he make this race so boring? Look, this book should have started and ended in the water. Why doesn't anyone edit anymore?"
1,Where's the Editor????,"This book is an object lesson in why illiterate adventurers shouldn't pen their own memoirs. How in the world did Goss take this incredible adventure and reduce it to the most inane, boring mush? He really could have used a better editor, perhaps one not equally illiterate."
4,Surprisingly good. An unexpected page turner.,"I didn't really expect to enjoy this book, not knowing much about sailing, but I couldn't put it down. Definitely worth reading."
1,Not my cup of tea,"There seems to be an odd hero worship associated with this author and his book about adventure and glory seeking. I found Goss's feats to be impressive but the account disturbing. I finished the book wishing I hadn't read it. He comes across as quite impressed with himself and has little of the modesty and understatement that I have found more typical of good adventure writing. (Compare Bernard Moitessier's books about equally difficult sailing accomplishments.) If you are looking for a philosopher/adventurer, Goss is not it. His reliance on expletives in key passages gives the account a vulgar quality. Like many others I was mystified as to why so much ink was spent on the fund raising effort. There probably was a good story there but I don't think he told it. Clearly Pete Goss is an awesome sailor, but this book portrays him more as attention seeker and even his website still boasts about the rescue. If you haven't read sailing books before read Moitessier or Smeeton instead."
3,Good Selection,The selection is a good one of older romantic comedies. I enjoyed them and recommend them to friends. They were mainly for my wife to enjoy.
5,Completed my project with ease...,"Purchased to re-work reclaimed lumber from an old granary I tore down. I removed old flooring and weathered siding from an old granary, cut off the damaged and dirty tongues and grooves, planed the wood, then cut new tongues and grooves with this set. I made enough flooring for a roughly 24 x 16 living room and 2 - 12 x 12 bedrooms, then made bead board from some of the siding to cover the ceilings in the two bedrooms and roughly 100 square feet of wainscot. This set never bogged down and kept a sharp, precision edge throughout the project. It appears to be up for whatever else I choose to throw at it. Very satisfied with the quality."
4,pleasant,"A pleasant surprise that this romantic comedy and fantasy in which a young American salesman of fireworks articles, seeking fortune in Latin America, established democracy. Romantic love, making business and passion for freedom are the three cornerstones of Americanism, here exposed with a frank and cheerful naiveté. A film highly ideological. Only with subtitles in English."
3,False Expectations,"Well,Neil give us Greendale,and i'm just a little disapointed about it.The old formula of creating his song,are just a bit boring.But we have good songs:Bandit and Be the Rain.Is just a good album with a few good songs.The Horses are a limited band,but Neil have make good albuns with there.So i have to wait until Neil realese another On the Beach or Comes a Time."
3,False expectations,"Well,here we have a Neil new album. have a little disapointement,when i listen this album.Ok,the Horse's are a fringe and limited band,but Neil have great albuns with them.Greendale is a little boring,and too much lo-fi.The formula is just the same,easy riffs and a few similar blues.That's ok.Bandit,Be the rain and falling from Abov(Buffalo Springfied riff)are good songs but the rest...Neil are just a few limited.Please give us another great album."
2,Go Bananas instead!,"I just bought Neil Young's latest album Greendale, along with Deep Purple's latest album, Bananas (import) and couldn't have had a more one sided listening experience.Two of my favorite artists seem to be going in different directions and I'm not talking musical. I can't believe how boring Greendale is, the playing lacks spark and the songs simply aren't that good or memorable. The arrangements are typical been there done that and Neil just doesn't sound like he`s having fun! When the disc ended I knew I wouldn't be in a hurry to play it again any time soon.On the contrary, Deep Purple's new album is everything Neil's isn't. Great songs, unbelievable performances and the band sound like they are having FUN! Plus, the running order of the album is just outstanding. I've played Bananas 10 times as much as Greendale.It's safe to say this is not Neil Young's finest hour, but it might be Deep Purple's.Two stars: GreendaleFive stars: Bananas"
1,Very boring,"Did Neil Young run out of musical inspiration a couple of years ago? Neither ""Silver and gold"" or ""Are you passionate?"" were good besides from a few tracks (like ""Buffalo Springfield again"" & ""You're my girl"") on each album. With the latest release ""Greendale"", Young gives us a concept album - a family tale. But it sure seems as Young got more interested in the story than in the music, because it's even more monotonous than we are used to. The music serves mostly as a back ground to Young's droning and sleepy vocals. I bought this album (like the previous two albums) unheard and I sure regret that. These days, Neil Young seem tired and he's a million miles away from the stuff he delivered on albums such as ""Harvest"", ""After the gold rush"", ""On the beach"", and ""Comes a time"". If you're not a really dedicated Neil Young fan (if you are, you already own this album) I wouldn't recommend this one, at least not as a first buy or a tenth either for that matter."
2,Wake Me Up When It's Over,"I love Neil Young and Crazy Horse but this album is a collection of unimaginative, mid tempo songs that chug along without purpose. If you loved ""Ragged Glory"" save your money."
4,It's better live,"I saw one of the U.S. Greendale tour stops and was swept away in the energy Neil generated with this material. That extra spark is lacking on the record. Still, it's an essential purchase if you're a fan. Highlights are Falling From Above, Devil's Sidewalk, Leave the Driving, Carmichael and Grandpa's Interview."
5,A Gentle Jam,"Most of the songs fall in to the 8-12 minute range with a mid tempo beat and some tasty guitar. As a reference point, if you like ""Ragged Glory"", this record is for you. I was disappointed with ""Year of the Horse"", ""Road Rock Volume I"" and ""Are You Passionate?"" but I believe Greendale is a return to form. Thanks Neil."
5,The Real Neil,"To be fair I am a long time Neil Young fan. I watched the DVD then listened to the CD after the 2nd time through I was hooked... Love this CD. Simple, straight forward, The real Neil."
1,A one-play CD at best...,"I got to hear this new material live this summer-- more than I wanted to hear as it turned out. He played it start to stop, it was an hour and a half but it seemed much longer. This is going to be my only time listening to this. I am sorry to say that most of it was pretty ordiinary and largely forgettable. I am a big fan of Neil Young but I can't recommend this to you."
2,Another lacklustre Neil Young album,"Neil Young is one of my heroes so it pains me to say that is yet another in a long string of utterly forgettable albums. The lyrics on here are terrible, so cliched it could be a parody. There's not one memorable melody on the whole album. I think Neil should take a break..."
1,Concert Goer Beware,"If you go to a concert misnamed ""Neil Young and Crazy Horse"" expect to hear every last cut from this dreary, banal, droning and relentlessly painful exercise in self-indulgence.The only reason most (former) fans stayed at Radio City last night was the forlorn hope of hearing two or three songs from Neil's creative past. Fat chance. Concert goers streamed out the door when it became clear that Neil was determined to inflict every last measure of pain possible on his audience. If, when the lights went on after the encore, the theatre was 1/3 full, I would be amazed. Caveat emptor!"
1,Radio City - Greendale sucks!,"Wow, my wife warned me about what she heard about his concert at Meadowlands. I didn't believe her. I thought it sucked and I did not appreciate being surprised by a Michael Moore concert. Should have went to see the Allman Brothers Band at the Beacon"
5,Riveting,"This is the best record Neil Young has released in about a decade, and is at least as interesting as Tonight's the Night if not more so. The story can be a little difficult and confusing to follow at times (no lyrics included), but I found it hard NOT to pay attention closely to each song. Although I don't agree with some of the political views expressed (enough of the liberal save-the-environment-agenda already), it's still a compelling take on modern American life. And the music is outstanding!! Some of the best guitar Neil has ever played and Crazy Horse (without Pancho for some reason) sound fantastic. The music has almost a Mirror Ball-ish feel to it in the production and roughness, but that's a good thing. Especially coming after Are You Passionate, this album is great!"
3,Longer Not Always Better,"I saw Neil perform this entire album this past summer. At the time, I thought it was some of his strongest material in years. My one hope was that, when put on CD, that the songs would be made more concise. While fifteen minute songs, with long solos, play well in a concert environment (and are expected at a Neil Young show), they don't play as well in studio. An album in the 45 - 50 minute range would have been much better. I find it hard to devote 78 minutes, in one sitting, to listening to a CD.As for the material, 'Bandit' is a wonderful, contemplative ballad. 'Be The Rain' and 'Falling From Above' should become concert staples. The playing by Crazy Horse is wonderful, actually restrained for them.Overall, a fine album, but makes me long for what might have been."
5,Neil does it again!,"Since those highly charged Weld days (how I love 'em) I have enjoyed the smooth, relaxed pace of Neil's recent albums. And with this album, Greendale, Neil Young has once again taken a new direction. This is a wonderfull collection of songs that tell the story of the Green Family in Greendale. The full story unfolds on the (included) DVD in both song and spoken word. The CD is a more polished rendering of the songs - less the spoken word. Neil proves once again that he is a master at building images from sound."
5,Long time Neil Young fan loves Greedale,"I wanted to catch Neil on tour this summer. It was just before the release of this CD and the entire show was devoted to Greendale. The characters acted out the story on stage while Crazy Horse delivered the music. It was different, but great. Neil is a character and has a relevant point of view on today's world. I am fairly certain I would have liked the record if I hadn't attended the show, but now I love it. I haven't watched the DVD yet, but I am sure it is great and makes the package worth buying. The music on this one is really the key. It is true to form Crazy Horse and must for any fan. I will be listening to Greendale for years to come."
3,Subjects for further research,"Okay, I admit it, I didn't get it until I played the bonus DVD and heard Maestro Young explain the story and the ""concept"" as he went through each of the songs. I'm more than happy to defer judgement on the audio disc until I give it a few more plays, but my initial impression is that this is a ""solo"" Neil Young album screaming to be released from its ""Neil Young with Crazy Horse"" prison. The sound is the muddy murk everybody's come to expect when Neil and the Horse team up; some people call it grungy, but ""goopy"" might be more appropriate. The live DVD, by comparison, is clear and clean, which, when you strip away everything except Young and his guitar, shows everything (including the performer) off to maximum advantage.It's way past time for people to stop kissing Neil Young's rear end and call him to account when he's shooting himself in the same anatomical region. And, yes, this is still a pretty [EXPLETIVE]good album."
2,humdrum,"I was sadly disappointed to hear Neil's opera cd, ""Greendale"", fall short of his potential. The songs on his new release sound tired, lack melody and are not very stirring. While the story about the Greens show Neil in a new direction with songs about an imagined family in Greendale, such as Double E that are listenable although the songs sound too identical to one another in their simplicity."
2,"Working title: ""Dullsville""","I've always admired the way Neil Young fearlessly goes wherever his Muse takes him, but the problem is that sometimes she takes him to places like Greendale, where there seems to be some sort of melody ban in effect. I asked a couple of locals about all the two-chord noodling but they just stared...."
3,Hmmmmmmm,"I can't really claim that this work is uneven, because it is probably one of the most consistent albums ever released (which is not neccassarily a good thing in this case). Unmelodic? You betcha, but it's got hooks galore compared to a dull work like Springsteen's ""Ghost of Tom Joad"". A concept album? Yep. A rock opera? Maybe. A novel in musical form? Most certainly, but that doesn't make it a good story. In fact the plot in a convoluted, soap-opera mess that sounds as if it were written by a 10 year old (though from the liner notes that accompany the CD I guess that may be the point). I do admire Young for trying to expand himself and I really like the ""megaphone"" vocals idea. But the bottom line for a work like this is: how is the story? In this case the story is silly and uninteresting."
2,I don't get it either,"I'm a big Neil Young fan, but this one leaves me cold. The lyrics are interesting, but the music sounds like it was written in about 10 minutes. Maybe that's the idea."
4,Solid effort,"Neil Young long ago passed the point where needs to please anyone but himself. The man is undisputedly one of the kings of rock and roll, and as far as I, and many others are concerned, he can do whatever he wants. The results of this attitude have had mixed results. Some good - ""Comes A Time"", some bad - ""Trans"".What he wanted to do this time was tell a simple story of a town, and it has ended up being possibly his best album in almost a decade. It's heavier and less heartsy - a departure from recent albums such as ""Silver and Gold"" and ""Are You Passionate?"" It sounds less like the newer Neil we have heard for the past few albums, and more like old Neil, staying up until the wee hours, having a few beers and jamming with Crazy Horse.Fans of such earlier albums like ""Ragged Glory"" and ""Mirrorball"" will indeed be pleased. ""Greendale"" is not his best, but it proves that Neil Young has still got some rock in him, and is not quite ready to rest on his laurels just yet."
2,more cliches than you can shake a stick at....,"Neil can be so good and soooo bad. This one's pretty lame. The song writing sounds real labored and the music just isn't that exciting either. I read a review that said his guitar playing was like ""Santana on valium."" Seems pretty accurate to me. Not much of a concept either."
4,Classic Neil Young is new again...,"There's just something that grips you when you listen to the album for the first time. It's raw. It's powerful. It's good.Neil Young's latest album ""Greendale"" is a story-driven concept album, almost to the point where one could consider it a rock-opera. The difference between this rock-opera and others (i.e. Tommy, The Wall) is that Young allows for a raw, almost under-produced sound, the sound he's become known for in his live performances with Crazy Horse. But it's not just those long-rockin' songs a la ""Cowboy in the Sand"" that are the jewels of this album. Young introduces a touch of smooth R&B, relaxed country, and hearty rock-a-billy into both the music and his lyrics in that lazy care-free style that only he could deliver. Whether you're a fan of early works like ""Harvest"" or later works like ""Ragged Glory"" you'll enjoy this back-to-basics sound of Neil Young at his best. Oh yeah, make sure to check out the DVD too. Definitely a worth-while purchase."
5,Neil shines bright!!,"There are two Neil's the cortez, the cinnamon girl the crazy horse bouncing off your wall and shaking the plaster from the frames Neil. The power chord gut check that moves your head and rattles your bones in standard time. Then there's the toe tapping neil, the philosopher, the road companion, the Canadian Keruoac that makes you want to pack up and take a longer look at the world, take a little more time, slow down, listen more. That's this Neil, that's what this album speaks, in a world of background music this album makes you pay attention! It's beautiful, it's harvest moon, it's silver and gold but has its own voice- it's a sunset dream, it's a conversation, it's georgeous and if you love neil for all that he is, then you'll love this album as well."
5,Neil Young Steps Three Steps Ahead,"Greendale is no ordinary collection of music. You will never here it on commercial radio, maybe a college album station or two. It is the best and freshest sound that I have heard in 20 years. From its reverberating strings to the old sound drum kit with plenty of use of the cymbal it after two passes from start to finish will have you agreeing that NY's poetry and truth is stronger than any you have heard before. If you are a Neil Young fan don't be looking for Cinnamon Girl and Down by the River."
4,It Ain't Harvest !,"If you have been a long time lover of Neil Young's music you should enjoy his new cd. By now long time fans of Neil know to expect the unexpected. If you are just a fan of his hits you will probably hate Greendale. I recently witnessed Greendale live and was completely blown away by the performance and story.However many ""fans"" seated near me were griping and booing because Neil wasn't playing his classics. The live Greendale is a very beautiful and moving story. I am not sure how people who have not seen it performed live will take to it. It's a concept album with themes of anti-violence, distrust of goverment, and love of the enviroment. If you're a true ""rustie"", put on the cd and enjoy!!"
2,Legendary lineup presented poorly.,"Great artists. Great songs. A great night. But for this DVD, they forced a 16:9 picture into a 4:3 frame. Another sub-par production from Roadrunner. Rent it."
4,A delightful insight to the world of the enigmatic Defoe,"With the tools of a storyteller, Richard West takes his readers on a journey to the world of the enigmatic Daniel Defoe and the political machinations of Britain at the dawn of the 18th century. To any reader,even to one who has a limited understanding of British history, West paves a path among the intrigue of the Whigs and Tories, and has his reader follow the footsteps of Defoe into the Tower of London, the roads of Great Britain, and the gardens of rulers. With the ability to explain Defoe's mysterious background, West guides the reader toward an understanding of a man who has remained elusive for centuries. West offers the reader an explanation for the many masks that Defoe wore as writer, invester, spy and traveler. With the skill of a story-teller, West opens a world of historic fact even to the most reluctant non-fiction reader."
4,Solid and Readable,"West provides a very readable, unfussy biography, presenting a vivid and detailed portrait of Defoe's life and times. He falls short with his ""analysis"" of the novels, which amounts to little more than plot summary, but his insight into Defoe's character--as a man of high moral principle who occasionally succumbed to expediency--is priceless."
3,PROBLEM SOLUTION DISCUSSION,"1.1 This BookProblemThe entire book is written in this silly format.SolutionIf this sort of thing bothers you, buy something elseDiscussionThis cloying and tiresome gimmick gets repeated throughout the entire book. Every time I pick it up, I feel like I'm listening to Donald Rumsfeld. There seems to be lots of good information about using Excel in scientific and engineering contexts, but the writing style is just too much for some of us. Whatever happened to straightforward narrative?"
1,an alternative point of view,"Be wary of using other programmer's work unless it has passed thesort of critical tests as available on the NIST site.A number of techniques in EXCEL are not useful for variousproblems in the sciences. There are also problems inherentin digital computation, regardless of language or platform,which can result in serious errors. If you are doing seriouswork, you should make the investment in the hardware andsoftware which can pass rigorous examination."
3,Excel Cookbook Half Baked,"It appears to be a good book but the writers style lacks substance. I could have written this book! I am not an expert on Excel but I have used it since the mid to late 1980's so I know a few things. The section on VBA was weak. I expected more but got less. Most Excel books are concentrated on Business Applications and I was hopeful to find one that actually had something to do with Engineering but it was too weak. No good examples, just pictures of spreadsheets and no formulas. Cut and pasting function names is lame!"
3,Slightly Dissapointing,"Don't get me wrong I love the Redwall books. But I think Brian Jacque's books have gone downhill since Lord Brocktree. I have read every Redwall book that Brian Jacques has wrote and I think he has finally run out of new creative ideas. Just about every aspect of Triss seems a repeat of his other books. The characters are undeveloped compared to the characters in his other books, and the story doesn't really have any of the exiting twists that I have learned to love and expect. To all of the new fans to the series I have one piece of advice. Read the classics like Mossflower and Pearls of Lutra before saying Triss is the best in the series."
4,Very Good.,"This is a good book, but Brian Jacques seems, about a 4 on a scale of 10, to be becoming uninterested in Redwall and its affairs. I don't mean to dissuade the reader from purchasing the book, because it is a very good book, but for people who are very picky about the style of their book and can tell the interest level of the author, I would recomend that they think for 5 seconds more than usual about buying this book."
5,A Beautiful Tale,"I gave Triss five stars because I really enjoyed it. I loved the poems and songs, especially how they help the charactors of the story. I also enjoyed the fact that all of the charactors in the story were animals. I like how the dialogue really went along with characters,and every animal has its own accent and uses different choices of words. I really found the story very intersting. It had some adventure (which I liked) but mainly dialogue and description. One thing I found most amazing was that at the beginning of every chapter the author makes a beautiful description of the setting. I really enjoyed the story and I hope many people do too."
3,Identical To All Other Redwall Books,"I am usually delighted in Mr Jacques funny and inviting style of writing-- and I still was, don't get me wrong. I love the descriptions of food/drinks (strawberry cordial!)and all the poems that he so brilliantly writes, but he does tend to be repetitive.The inside cover of the book told me and everyone else who bothered to read it that these three travelings would be intertwined-- and they were...but I was disappointed at how subtle and boorish it became. Journeys are rarely and exciting event for me, and this was no exception. Evenso, applaud must be given for his inserted humor (notice the hares) and narrative.Still, you should probably read it if you are a devoted Redwall fan, and if you've read anything by Jacques, than you should also read the Castaways of the Flying Dutchman. Written in the same style as Redwall, with a touch more of excitement."
3,Triss? It could have been more.,"Triss was a very interesting novel only more and more in Jacques's books the entire welcome all trust all themes tend to flood the senses with a gush of ingratitude... Everyone must constantly worry about Redwall and protect it because of this thought process. The book is alright but it's nothing particularly remarkable as it could have or might have been. It is littered with exagerated themes and once gain a good against evil battle somewhere up north. A female warrior carries Martin's sword and many follow it to simple dooms which always seem to be the most painful at their typicalness. You'll want to read it of course because it's Brian Jacques, so hey! go ahead, it's not that bad."
2,Brian Jacques is Losing His Touch,"I'm a very avid Brian Jacques fan, but Triss has to be the worst one yet. Nothing in the entire novel was original; it was all the same gluttonous hares, naughty dibbuns and smelly, stupid vermin. I think it's about time for a change of pace. Nothing seems to be changing, it's just a recycling of old, overused ideas. Now, I shall definitely keep reading Jacques's Redwall books for as long as they continue to come out, but I seriously think it's about time for something different and radical."
4,Triss rocks!,"This was a great book. It's filled with excitement and murder.I would recommend this book to anyone. Also, anyone who hasn't seen the TV show has to read this book. I really wantthe book to be read!"
1,Its getting worse,"At one time I was a true Redwall fan, and all I did was think, eat, and read Redwall, but times have changed. This series has gone from good to horrible. Triss is a complete copy of all Jacques other books, he has done nothing new, absolutely nothing. How is it that a young squirrelmaid is able to defeat ""a bad guy"" who has been training with swords their whole life, yet Triss has never touched one. This series is hard to believe and not worth my time anymore, and I don't think it will be worth yours either, so stay away read something else, focus on Eragon and Eldest by Christopher Paolini, books one and two of the Inheritance Trilogy. Paolini is the new king of young adult fantasy, hail Paolini not Jacques, Jacques has been dethroned!"
3,Texas Longhorns golf cart bag,"the cart bag is great, and the price was even better, BUT it was not quite burnt orange like i hoped it would be."
5,Sweeeeeeeeeeet!!!,"It's about time that brilliant composers like Scott Bradley and Carl Stalling (Warner Bros.) were honored with releases like this. Unlike the 'Carl Stalling Project' CDs, these seem to be the full soundtrack to the cartoons from the theme song all the way to the closing. Most tracks are 5-7 minutes long. 'Pecos Pest' is a standout track. Remember Jerry's singing - guitar picking cousin, who plucks one of Tom's whiskers every time his guitar string breaks? Classic! I'm enamored, what more can I say? Play this sucker and your home turns into a Saturday morning from your youth, sans the TV. I highly recommend this, and it's limited to 3000, best hurry up and order!"
1,Not meant for people with vision problem,I will return this watch today. I bought it for my father with vision problem. It is difficult to set time and stainless steel band is complicated to use. They shouldn't advertise it for people with vision problem and very ugly watch.
5,Time on my hands,"I have everything good about my 4 alarm talking watch.I've given them as gifts, 8 so far, and evry one in my family, and friends considers it the best gift i have ever given them.Sincerely.Vern."
2,returned for refund,"The watch features didn't work. I couldn't even set the time. It was too bulky to feel comfortable on the wrist and too complicated to use. I bought it for my special needs son so he could hear the time of day instead of always asking someone, but even if it had been operable, it was too complicated to use easily."
1,Watch Does Nothing,The watch would not start up after trying several times. I did exactly what the directions said and it just did not work.
1,Disappointed,I ordered this watch for my blind father for a christmas gift. When I received it yesterday the watch had a mark on it and its defective. It turned on but it doesn't work at all. I'm very disappointed with this product and am still waiting for a response from the seller.
2,not worth the price,The watch worked for 6 weeks at that time the battery died and no one would change the battery unless we bought it at the store. I was able to get a battery but once it was replaced finally the watch would not work
1,Where is quality control,"Please be advised that when I received this watch there was a pin missing in the watch band. Therefore, I have to take this in and get the pin put in the watchband, hopefuly that can be done or otherwise I will be returning it for a refund. I feel that if this watch had been carefully checked before it was shipped out this would not be an issue, hopefully the watch would have been repaired and another one sent to me in its place. Do not appreciate the fact that I payed $29.91 for the watch and am now going to have to pay to have the pin replaced in the band.. If it can not be repaired here it comes back to Amazon.com for a refund.. What a waste of my time and money to have to do all this running and pay for the cost of returning a product that should have been checked before it was shipped to me.."
3,You get what you pay for...,"Purchased this item 3/2/12 for my 91 year old, visually impaired father. The buttons are VERY sensitive. With the slightest brush from the cuff of his shirt, or with the bend of his wrist it would announce the time. However, about the first week or two of August 2012 - he inadverently pressed two buttons at the same time. He claims it made a 'pop' sound and quit working. The screen went blank. I replaced the battery - and it will now display a 12:00 time and move forward in time. However, it will no longer talk, or allow the mode, adj or set buttons to function. It was a good watch for about 4 months! I have sent an email to the seller (Magnifying Aids) requesting their input on how to fix/repair/replace this item. I will try to update this if/when I receive a response. In the mean time, I will be purchasing another talking watch - from a different seller in a slightly different model."
2,Biography-Hatfiels and mcCoys,"I'm sorry I didn't like the Biography of the Hatfeils and McCoys. it's my faught ,I thought it would be like the movie, but it wern't."
2,Good movie,My hubby missed it on history channel so for his birthday i order it but recieved wrong one.but he enjoyed it any way.
4,interesting story...,The whole thing that happened between the Hatfields and McCoys was crazy and foolish. It is a good read to be educated on American History.Just wish it hadn't taken 5 weeks to get to me...
4,A Very Top-Level Overview of the Feud,"If you know nothing about the Hatfield & McCoy Feud this video is a nice introduction. It is well produced and reasonably accurate. They interview several descendents of the original families plus the best-known authors of books on the subject. There's not a lot of detail though. If you really want to understand the relationships between the families, the geography of the region and the political situation you'll need to do quite a bit of additional reading and study."
4,Nice shoe,"I ordered this shoe and had to send it back. I absolutely love it and think it is a beautiful shoe. However, I wear a 13M and found it to be a bit too short. My toes hung over the shoe. Definitely order a half size larger than usual if you can. Other than size, they're very comfortable and will dress up any outfit."
5,History From First Hand Accounts,"This is an excellent book that combines the dramatic first hand experiences of SS Panzer crews with an abundance of photos from the period 1943-1945. The book covers both the Russian and Western Fronts and includes such battles as Charkow, Kursk, Caen , Normandy, Falaise, Ardenne, Berlin. I found the first hand accounts quite intense and descriptive that made it easy to visualise the conditions and apprehension of battle. What comes across is the fighting quality and ability of the panzer crews who are still able to inflict heavy losses on Allied and Russian forces despite numerical inferiority and lack of air superiority. There are many photos throughout, but the book is much more than a photographic portrayal, it is a valuable historic record of German first hand accounts of battle and therefore is a valuable historic record in itself."
1,This is not Season 7 ... it's an episode from Season 6,"These episodes are all from Season 6 ... which apparently is the final season. So, then, what's up with this Season 7 stuff?"
4,An improvement over the weaker season 6,"This final season still left some holes and questions, but overall it is stronger than the preceding weak season.Christian faces major trauma with Kimber, Matt continues to make the worst possible decisions, Julia finally gets a new life, Sean eventually stops being used as Christian's punching bag and gets to carve out a new life as well, and Christian and Liz make peace and form a new kind of relationship.Some things got dropped: Why was Wilber hardly ever around? Why wasn't there more material dealing with the aftermath of Kimber? What happened to Lipo the dog? Why didn't Christian ever call up his daughter Emme? If Kimber had such a bad childhood, why didn't her mother address this? Is Julia's mother in the pokey?"
4,"3.5 for Last Season, 7","This show just concluded on March 3, 2010. It definitely had seen its best days and didn't have much else to cover with its two main characters. Its a mixed season of ups and downs with some episodes being terrific and others so-so. The episode where the two surgeons go into couples therapy together is one of the funniest things ever shown on tv. Yet there are also many episodes which are just downright sappy. If you have never seen this show before, this is NOT the season to start. You would only get something out of this season if you had seen the others as ""wind up"" is written all over it. I'm not sorry I watched the last season but it had reached the end of what it had been doing well."
3,Just OK,"Just a couple of comments. First is that the pivots on the lights are pretty cheap. They do not fasten together, but are rather just held in place by a bolt, with a hand adjustment knob. Loosen that knob too much, and the whole stack of cards crumbles. The entire pivot assembly will come right apart.Second is that the lights themselves as much as REQUIRE barn doors for any video shooting. They cast such a huge radius of bright white light, that they're pretty overpowered for mood lighting out of the box. Pretty good for interviews though.That said, I'm pretty happy with them for the price. The value is really in the stands, as they are really sturdy and well constructed - even better than the ones my school uses. You could pick up some cheap work lights from Menards or Home Depot, and achieve the same lighting effect you get with these, but you will be without stands or diffusers. So base your purchase on how much you need the stands, rather than the lights themselves."
2,Flimsy but great,I knew what to expect for the price. I don't have much money but needed lighting for certain things.*Hard to put together*Great lighting*Easy portable due to light weight*No bag for transportationThe only really bad thing about this kit are the umbrellas. I would not recommend this kit because of the umbrellas. The knobs came off after 5 minutes. Three knobs of one umbrella were off within a day. Other knobs of the other umbrella popped off within the next week. Make sure to purchase extra umbrellas if you are interested in a soft lighting - because I can guarantee you that the knobs are going to pop off within few days and that means that the fabric of the umbrella is going to come off.I still gave it two stars due to the fact that the lighting itself is a great buy and I am happy with it and the results of my photography.
4,Great lighting set to start with,This is a very nice set if you're starting out in photography. It goes together easily and seems to be sturdy and is inexpensive. It works very well for the lighting that I will be needing.
4,Good Value,"I bought these to improve my indoor photography of paintings and items for ebay. They are a decent value for the price although I will probably go for 500W bulbs at some point to get more light. The quality is not ""industrial"" stength, but for the money and use I plan - they are great.My first few photos have been excellent."
3,good starter,"This is a good starter kit, not really powerful lighting but I get great shots and like being able to control lighting for photo boothes etc."
4,Invaluable Sayings of a Sage Compiled.,"'My writings should me cremated with my body', that is what the Mahatma said. But the sutras (sayings) of Gandhi have an immortal value though they may not be always witty or even epigrammatic. This book is a collection of his sayings on subjects as varied as 'democracy' and 'brahmacharya'. The brief introduction gives a short biography of Gandhi and highlights his relevance in the world today. This book is indeed a welcome addition to the host of literature about Gandhi."
4,continues the Czech absurdist tradition,"I make no bones about it, I love Jan Svankmajer. _Conspiritors of Pleasure_ was a delightful film; it dragged in places, and some segments worked better than others (hence only 4 stars), but it was poingiant, sensitive, and sometimes hysterically funny.Svankmajer's storytelling does for cinema what Czech writers like Hrbal, Hasek and Kundera have done for traditional print literature. The Brothers Quay are grimmer, grittier and lack the subtle humor, warmth and humanism of Svankmajer...a side of the filmmaker that shines thru especially in THIS film."
3,good for begginers,"this one from Jan was cool,but just not quite as trippy as Faust or his collection of short film dvds,I thought.I did think it was funny though!I liked the short film ""food""(included w/ the dvd)better than ""conspirators of pleasure"",actually-and you can get that short w/ the jan collected shorts vol. 2 dvd.I couldn't see paying $26 for this dvd, though.get alice,collected shorts 1+2,or faust before this one.those are actually more worth the money as far as I'm concerned."
2,"""Conspirators of Pleasure"" filled with mindless puppets","Jan Svankmajer's attempt at addressing the constant battle between good and evil in this universe fails to bridge the ever existing fjord. Clearly, Jan is taking an omnipotent view of the cultural evolution of the masses, but neglects to explain anything."
2,Just mechanical pratice without detailed instructions,"It may be especially useful to fix the eyes to the center of column while you read a book in a bus or train rather than hand-moving style speed reading. However, this book doesn't guide detailed instructions for better understanding. Just checking stopwatch while reading lots of practice portion repeatedly, and most of them are novels. Speed reading for fiction? That's stupid!"
2,Incomplete Suite,"OK, it's a great Russian composer played by a Russian orchestra. But I was disappointed that a CD called ""The Firebird Suite"" doesn't include all of The Firebird Suite. My favorite movement, the Finale, isn't on the CD. If you want a sampling of Stravinsky works, this may be a good choice. If you want a recording of the Firebird Suite, you won't get it all with this CD."
5,Stravinsky: The Firebird Suite; Symphony No. 1; Fireworks; Scherzo Fantastique,Stravinsky: The Firebird Suite; Symphony No. 1; Fireworks; Scherzo Fantastique is a 1999 Decca Record Company Limited recording starring the St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra under direction of Vladimir Ashkenazy. I agree that they play these works in an authentic Russian spirit. Andrew Huth has written the music notes. An oustanding recording that does justice to the genius of Stravinsky. Highly recommended. 5/5.
3,Planning and Design of Fixed Offshore Platforms,Great book. All personel involved in the offshore industry should have one.
4,Great characters,"Normally I'm not a big fan of police procedurals, so I'm not even sure why I picked it up at first. But darned if I didn't find myself really getting into the story! I realized that the reason I enjoyed this book so much was because of the characters.Ty Merrick is great, with her condition that is both blessing and curse. Gibson keeps me guessing. Sometimes he seems cold and calculating, and at other times he truly seems to care for Merrick. He's a good foil for her. And even LaRue and Baba are fun to read.I know Denise Vitola has written several other books in the series. I hope she continues."
5,A Quantum Leap,"The cover grabbed me and the writing held me. Surprisingly, I've never been a fan of werewolf novels, but I'm a Ty Merrick fan from here on out.Jo Anne Horn"
3,Unknown benefits of a destructive natural force,"I was generally surprised to learn of the many positive benefits of lightning. I typically associated lightning with destruction and chaos.The book was written simply enough for a layman (like me!) however, it over simplified the subject matter, in certain points.Strong points: Brief and factualWeak points: Poor editing, lack of illustrations, lack of background information.I would recommend this book to anyone who is seeking a different perspective on the subject of lightning. It offers a different take on the phenomena from standard encyclopedia references."
4,"Entitled to his opinion, certainly.","Since Ivor Gurney made these precedent songs in considerable isolation, not so much free of contemporary influence as deprived of it, it's a wonder he created such images. Not the easiest book for a person encountering his work for the first time - go to '80 Poems or So' or the Everyman edition for more accessible work. But even the most tortuous verses are rewarding, and such poems as 'Sailor', 'The Room of Two Candles', 'Birds', 'The Unfamiliar Camp', and 'Talking Under the Stars' cannot fail to move the reader. This book got 4 stars instead of 5 only because it is not as approachable to a reader less familiar with Gurney. For those that know his work, 'Best Poems' IS a must to own, and extremely fascinating."
5,Leather and Steel History of the 13th Pa. Cavalry,"Great Seller, Super transaction, would buy from again, Highly recommended.great book, it is in excellant condition."
5,Just an Awesome CD!,"I first had the chance to listen to Doc Powell in the late 1990's on now defunct Radio Station WJJZ in Philadelphia. This station played the best mix of jazz I had ever heard, and Doc was a regularly featured artist. Inner City Blues moves from start to finish and all the songs are excellent. Doc is as good as they get, and this CD is worth every penny. One fine jazz guitarist!"
4,The quest and journey of a life time is about to begin.,"Star Ocean: the second story After attaining the rank of Ensign in the EF (earth federation) Claude C. Kenni, one of the main characters lands on a planet named Milocina. Claude and his father Ronixis J. Kenni search the planet for a strange energy reading. They arrive at a dome shaped biulding in side a wierd object transports Claude to a distant planet called Expel. the quest starts there were you find the second main character. Rena Lanford who lives in Arlia (a primitive village on the island Cross). The game controls are a 8/10 and eazy to learn the graphics are a cool 9/10 and the sound is an awesome 9/10 like most RPGs you can name the characters any name you want. I would say to buy the game and order the strategy guide from Amazon. have a fun time!"
5,Has it been one odf those day's,"Has it been one of those day's when you can't figure out what to do or can't figure out what the Star Ocean: The Second Story well the stratagy guide will help you find rare equipment,tell what a monster's weakness is and, give nice detailed maps so if you need help get the prima stragy guide."
3,Excuse me....,"I am half way playing through this game And I wonder where can I find the secret combat skill ""Float""... I had find through the whole guide and it didn't state where can I find it, only telling me that there is a secret combat skill available..... Does anyone here now about it? please tell me..."
4,A must-have if you want to uncover the secrets in Star Ocean,"Not only is this game the best role-playing game for the PlayStation this year, it has an awesome strategy guide from Prima. If you want tips on item creation and side-quests, this is the book to have. The only problems with the strategy guide is that there is no map for the bonus dungeon and the boss tips could be more thorough. However, the great price from amazon.com makes it worth the measly 12 bucks you dish out for it!"
5,Great product,The product works great but the camera doesn't accept this kind of connection to the computer so while the cable worked just fine I had to use a card reader to get the pictures out of the camera.
5,She surpassed herself.,"I own and regularly use many different types of oracle cards in my private spiritual practice, as well as in the meditation class I facilitate. For a long time the Zen cards were a favorite until a friend showed me the Tao Oracle. Now this is the set of cards and book I use daily."
2,101 Dalmatians,I received the right cover and the wrong dvd -- it was a song dvd of an old-time crooner whose name I can't remember. I didn't send it back because it would have cost more than the film. Now I don't trust whoever it was to send me the right one. Is it too much to ask that sellers double check the contents of the jackets? This has happened to me more than once. Sue Sowden
3,"okay, but not really impressed","I've only recieved two issues so far, but I'm not really impressed with it....At this point I am wishing I had stuck with Whole Dog Journal...There's not really much to this that is useful that I can see."
2,Toeing the Party Line,"Ebtekar definitely has an ax to grind since she was directly involved in the Embassy take-over. Nevertheless, it is always interesting to read an insider's view as long as one does not take it for the gospel.What is highly interesting is that you get to see stuff they don't generally tell you about the take-over, such as how the students pieced back together the shredded documents. Unfortunately, Ebtekar does not take a step back to view the events in an historic context which is understandable since she is now a Big Cheese in the current administration and presumably does not want to upset the apple cart."
1,Do you really want to support a terrorist?,"I find it breathtaking that this book can claim to be an explanation of political events ""behind the scenes."" This woman is part of the Iranian government that oppresses its own people and denies rights to anyone who thinks or acts differently from the ruling mullahs.Why doesn't the author talk about the repression and chaos that the revolution brought to Iran? Why doesn't she discuss the thousands of political prisoners that are STILL being tortured there?Some will claim its always best to ""understand"" the minds of sick, murderous people....Just like books written by Charles Manson, this book attempts to profit off a horrible act and spin history to blame the victims. SHAMEFUL!A reader in Washington, DC"
4,good gun,"THIS GUN IS GREAT BUT THE GUY BELOW ME IS NOT LYING AM NOT JOKING THE MAG IS NOT HIGH CAP. HOLDS LIKE 40 BBS. SO BUY THE MAG BELOW,R6 VERSION"
3,Can't wear it,"I've been looking for the perfect all-leather close-toe sandal but this wasn't it for me. The sole is leather but the upper inside is material. The strap on the back of the heel is also material but it's comfortable.- I needed something that covered my toes and this doesn't. It looked like it would from the pictures... The area over the big toe will cover half the toenail if you push your foot ALL the way forward but that's not comfortable or practical.- If you need sandals that cover your toes these aren't it.----------------------------Quality - Awesome leather, perfect color, good design (other than not covering the toe), perfect rubber sole and having leather under your foot is priceless."
5,OK although a USB connection would be less trouble,I have had this for about one year and it works well.
4,"Dull film, great soundtrack","One of the few good things about the film was its soundtrack. Random Hearts was unbelievable and lethargic, with Harrison Ford barely making an effort at acting and Kristen Scott Thomas doing great with anger and anxiety, but going awkward when attempting warm emotions. The film might have been helped by a livelier soundtrack (it needed something to inject suspense, though a better screenplay may have done the job); however, Grusin is always good and this seems like one of his best -- sensitive, meaningful jazz, wasted on a story that couldn't support the soundtrack. This CD should stand on its own, music probably written for a much more romantic film and characters with real chemistry. Suggestion: Play this CD and dream up a fantasy in your head to match the music."
4,The music is the best thing about the movie.....,Even Harrison Ford couldn't pull this one off. I didn't care for the book but thought for sure that the movie couldn't be as bad... I was wrong.... but the music was TERRIFIC !!! Went and bought the soundtrack after I got out of the movie and I'm glad I did.
1,Grusin Stinks!,What an ego! He plays a key and another key and another key. Where's the music? I haven't heard anything but Grusin's individual keys. Anybody that buys his music will be very disappointed.
1,I had a problem,After using this one time I struggled with bringing my pool back into balance for rest of season. It was pretty when we did it. But it really sucked to have to deal with cloudy green tinted water for weeks after. We never really did recover. I have an above ground pool and we had not had any problems with it until the day after using the blue dye.
3,More an experiment than a story,"Beautiful writing, skillful handling of mythic elements, mysterious illustrations.Kind of short on plot."
5,A great buy,As an African American living in Chicago I am really enjoying this book. I purchased it for a class but I will never get rid of it; the book has so much information that you probably wouldn't be able to find anywhere else.
5,The Bride Wore Chocolate,"Thoroughly enjoyable. I love a humorus book with fun characters. Loving chocolate the way I do, I could sure understand the craving."
2,dismayed,"This was evidently a work for a small cross section of chef salad chocaholic.s I was bored out of my mindwith all the choc recipe addiction. Sorry but I couldn't get past the fourth chapter. Course I'm a man, so what do I know?"
3,Chocolate Delight,"The book was unusual in that the recipes were hilarious and everything revolved around chocolate. I'm a little more old-fashioned about sex for sex's sake alone, but it is the modern outlook. Not that it is any better than my views of keeping some things between you and a partner a little more sacred, but I can understand as I have children and they have grown up with so much more freedom. In these books, I hope that fidelity plays a part once they get married as I think it makes for a better marriage to have some trust etc."
5,This book is a must-read!,"I loved this book. This funny, sexy, melt-in-your mouth story about a sensible bride-to-be, her straight-laced groom-to-be, and an accidental complication--a temptingly delicious bachelor-for-life with a romantic streak as wide as a river of Godiva kept me guessing all the way to the tasty conclusion.The moment I read about the heroine waking up in the wrong man's bed after her can't-find-a-wedding-dress pity party (whoops!) I knew this story was a winner. If you love romantic comedy, especially fast-paced, witty, FUN writing, this is the book for you."
