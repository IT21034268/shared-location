5,Perfect Mid-size Moose,"Cute and cuddly the perfect mid-size moose. This moose is very soft, very durable, and very cute. Perfect for any child or adult who loves moose."
3,"Lack of originality, yeah...","It sounds the same from the beginning to the end... Furious, noisy, without a break. In my opinion a true black metal album must have instrumentals and more of an ambient sound. It must sound mysterious, dark and gloomy. This one fails at this point. The music is boring, and besides, there's a bit of techno in it, specially in the first song. It could perfectly fit in a rave party.... Good black metal bands are Gehenna, Arcturus and early Dimmu. Cradle is also great, despite it's not actually black metal..."
3,a little disappointing,"Well written classic supersonic theory, but ""flavor"" of numerical methods is given only : I think a college textbook of that price should give more than just flavor. Classic supersonic theory is not complete and needs to be integrated with other prior classic books (i.e. Ferri, Aerodynamics of supersonic flows). Overally, a little disappointing about the quantity of information given."
5,Great Text,"This book is a great graduate or undergraduate text on compressible flow. It covers all the major topics with thorough and elegant proofs of the equations. Anderson is probably one of the best authors who write about extended topics in fluid mechanics (CFD, aerodynamics, compressible flow). I reference this text often."
2,Binding is garbage,"The content is fine, but the binding is garbage. I doesn't stay open, so I have to set heavy things on it to keep it open to the page I'm working on. Because of that I'm 4 weeks into the semester and pages are already falling out."
5,"If you're into aerospace engineering, you gotta read this!!!","Riveting and captivating! Those are the 2 words I will use to describe this book. From the table of contents to the enlightening appendices, this book was simply amazing! I don't know what I would have done without it."
3,D'Artagnan Medallion of Foie Gras with Truffles,"Taste is really nice, but :- presentation is not great (you have to squeeze it from a plastic bag),- it's quite a big piece, so if you are not a big enough group of persons to eat it you will have to throw away part of the Foie Gras, which is a pity,- and it's not a real piece of Foie Gras, the texture is much closer to a ""pt√©"" to spread."
2,WRONG DESCRIPTION!,"Its actually truly 2-pack, 6 oz each. Total is 12 oz, Not 72 as per description.Had to cancel my order."
4,Practical Demonstration,The good doctors takes you through a complete day in the life of a neolithic hunter using his knappingskills on one piece of obsidian from hand-ax to scraper to replaccement point.Worthwhile demo and a broad overview.
2,confused,"Wasn't what I expected, it much thinner than I thought. However it came very quickly, so I was bale to improvise by gluing three sheets together."
3,Banged up on the corners,"As other reviewers have commented, the package arrived with the posterboards banged-up a bit on the edges. Do not buy this item if you need nice clean corners. The stickers on each posterboard was easily removed."
5,Pinker Does It Again,"Well, Pinker does it again!This is one damn fine book dealing with important issues of not only linguistics, but even deeper concepts of how our brains fundamentally work! Using the whole concept of irregular-regular verbs as a entre to his topic, Pinker explore so many interesting paths. As an amateur linguist, I found this book a tour de force. It's not only informative and intriguing, but also funny.I was deeply impressed by Pinker's THE LANGUAGE INSTICT, and this book followed right in that tradition."
5,Perfect for us word nerds,"The thing about Steven Pinker is that he can take an esoteric subject like How the Mind Works, or 'Words and Rules', and through his wit and choice of examples, make the subject not only come alive, but charm us as well. Who would have thought that a book about irregular English verbs would be so much fun to read?"
2,I was boreded! (overusing the -ed rule;-),"I didn't really dislike this book, but that was only because I'm a linguist myself. Ordinary people will more than probably find this book as dull as ditchwater. Even I considered giving up a couple of times, which is a good indication that the book wasn't really 'a gem' as the cover claimed..."
3,Psycho -emphasis PSYCHO- linguistics for dummies,"Go ahead - drive yourself krazy & Read this massive literature review! here's all the evidence that mind creates language using rules operating over symbols vs. connections/dynamical organization. A must have for adherents of computational Hypothesis/neo-nativists accounts of bio-based Language acquisiton device/UG. Rules, argues, Pinker, solves lots of problems - from past-tensing to neologisming. If you love experimental evidence, this is the book for you. (You're probably a graduate student or professor). If you're a regular person who just wants to know about language, you may a have a problem understanding the significance of the arguments. WOrse yet, the material could bore you to death.Yet pinker is valient in his efforts of entertaining while educating."
3,Slap jaw yokel,"Yes, yes this is engaging and is interesting but only for the layman or shall I say monkey. It is useless for those who have taken even a single undergrad course in linguistics. It is also ripe with misogynist anti semitic hatred. Say no to the Pink stuff."
4,"focused, interesting book","I rank this book ahead of How the Mind Works and behind the Language Instinct, but all three were quite informative and enjoyable. Pinker has returned to his core compentency- linguistics. May be a little too narrow for those looking for another philosophy of mind tome."
4,My Son loves Magic School Bus,The Magic School Bus series are excellent books for young readers. My son loves them and loves to learn new facts about the world around him. I highly recommend them.
5,The Power of Reading,"This is a beautiful story about the power of reading. The film gives a moving insight into the condition of slavery in general and those who tried to open the door to literacy in particular. It is wonderfully acted, directed, and written. I showed it to my 8th grade reading class and they were enthralled. (And it isn't easy to enthrall 8th graders these days) Once you see it you will never forget it."
3,Not as good as the book...,"I got this DVD as a companion to the book Nightjohn by Gary Paulsen. I taught the book for about a week. The movie has a great deal added to it that the book did not have. I liked the book for its simple, stark nature. The only real similarities between the book and the film were the names of the characters and some plot elements."
2,Nightjohn Review,"After having my 8th grade class read the Gary Paulsen novel for class, I decided to purchase the movie. Needless to say the movie is nothing like the book. I agree that there was no need to show the brutality of the book, but there was also no need to completely change the storyline, adding events that just shouldn't have been there, as well as changing the outcome for Nightjohn and Sarny."
4,Another Look at the Cruelty Slavery,"NightJohn was focused more on slaves not being allowed to learn to read/write and is recommended because it's another area to look at how cruelty was practiced during slavery. Not only the inhumane physical torture to break the body and will that is usually portrayed in ""slavery in America"" movies, but this movie focused on the attempt to keep the slave mentally crippled/enslaved ""total helplessness"". It was a crime subject to extremely harsh punishment or even death, if caught learning to read or write. It shows the courage and strong will of one particular slave in his determination to pass on what he had learned to other slaves, against all odds and regardless of consequences. Fine acting from the entire cast. Especially, Carl Lumbly, Beau Bridges, and the little girl, Allison Jones."
3,Too Bad I Read The Book First,"If I had seen it before reading the book I might have been able to appreciate it for the movie that it is. However, it takes such liberties with the story it is based on that my students said if it weren't for the title it would be unrecognizable as the same story. Both they and I were very disappointed. The book is fabulous, why couldn't they just have let it be?"
5,The Power of Words,NightJohn is a movie that has very realistic characters and teaches us just how important it is to gain knowledge.
5,A CHARLES BURNETT FAVORITE,"Night John. Though, this movie was adapted by a book written from a white liberal point of view it was a wonderful piece of art.Charles Burnett is one of my favorite directors. An interesting film form a child's point of view.A MUST SEE!"
4,Some what good overall,"As an African-American I am interested in movies about Black history, Black culture, and life during slavery and historical black events.As a result I purchased about a dozen DVDs on various subject matter which I am just now getting around to viewing.This DVD gave me more insight into how slaves learned to read and write. And how the knowledge learned was passed on to others.Very heartwarming story. Some good acting by Allison Jones as Sarny."
3,good intentions,"Good story. Allison Jones does not quite come through in this her first film, but Beau Bridges and Carl Lumbly help to pick up the slack."
5,VERY GOOD,I loved this movie---especially when they're in the church at the end! Wish they had elaborated more on the ending though. But is good and worth the money.
4,A different story,"Rather different from the book, missing several key points that are utterly replaced by others... But a good movie with a good point and still useful for Compare/Contrast assignments for my students."
3,Good movie,I learned a lot from this movie so willothers who watch it also. It taught methings about slavery i never knew.
4,Stuart's life lessons.,"Stuart has laid out a valuable book for all who will come into an inheritance. There are many lessons, and examples that can be a road map to what your family should do when this event takes place. There are so many ways to go wrong and make poor decisions when preparing to receive wealth that a parent or family member leaves for you. This book helps to guide you in what needs to be done, so that you can bless your family and others with what you are given."
3,wealth for the family,"This book is very thorough, but I thought it dealt too much in family wealth for wealthy people and not enough for personal wealth. The title does not reflect this."
3,Wealth management,Overall the book provides a good overview on the topic of wealth management. It may also be useful to refer to while chosing a wealth manager. Many topics and chapters are wordy and you may lose focus many times during the reading. But if you are serious on gaining basic knowledge on the topic of wealth management it maybe a good book to start with.
3,Effective albeit plodding guidebook on wealth management,"Author Stuart Lucas is an heir to the Carnation family fortune, so he knows a little something about wealth. This book is a useful, albeit somewhat plodding, handbook on managing wealth. It covers almost all the fundamentals except how to make it. It's a bit like the old Steve Martin routine, ""How to Make a Million Dollars and Never Pay Taxes.""""Ok, first - get a million dollars....and then ...For those who do not inherit their fortunes, means other than inheritance will have to drive the ability to arrive at a level of wealth, enabling the tips and techniques that Lucas discusses. For those who want to better organize their finances, plan their estates or who experience a ""liquidity event,""""Wealth"" is an effective guide to picking a financial advisor and assessing one's own financial aims."
4,A Wonderful Collection of Tunes,"When this disk arrived in the mail, I really dreaded auditioning it. I had never heard of Redwing Music or Cindy Mangsen, and I have never been all that much of a folkie. But what a pleasant surprise I received upon hitting the play button on my CD player--Songs of Experience is a wonderful collection of tunes, and Cindy Mangsen's voice reminds me of Joan Baez at her peak. Most of the songs are quite old in their origin, and Mangsen supplies the both lyrics and brief notes about each one. There is even a back cover photograph by Cindy Mangsen that is utterly beautiful. Folk music fans should find Songs of Experience a recording well worth seeking out."
5,"Helpful, informative","After I watch a DVd, I notice what,""sticks"". There was a lot in this one. The makeup section shows how to do professional stage makeup, and I LOVED the arabic tutorial at the end. The section on creativity was fantastic, with several really down to earth things said that stuck with me ( one dancer said that you need ,""input"" as well as ,""output"")...the live dancing section was a hair too lengthy, but also super informative. Another great DVD from Michelle."
3,"5 stars for EV, 3 for their album","These ladies had a lot of talent and I'm still sad that they broke up. I honestly think the album sucks because I've seen them perform live many times and I thought they were bad ass. The only good thing about the album was the vocals. These girls can sing, but the production on the album totally took away from the quality of their voices. It's a shame. Anyway, everything else was pretty crappy, including the cover photo. These girls are some of the hottest Filipinas I've ever seen, but this picture does them no justice at all. Anyway- 5 stars for Epic Voices, 3 stars for the wack ass Keith Martin production on their album"
2,Several errors/misprints...,"The pictures of the projects in this book are wonderful; that's what prompted me to attempt to make several of them. I was well on my way into the first one when I noticed that the instructions provided did not yield the results I expected; in fact, the instructions for an entire row were omitted!Since I am an experience crocheter, I was able to figure out how to fix it and continue on. However, later in the same project, I encountered more discrepancies. I figured out how to correct the problems and was able to finish the project.Had this happened on only one project, I would not be writing this review. The sad part is that every one of the four projects I attempted (I only finished the first one) contained errors in the instructions. After encountering the first error, I abandoned the projects.I agree with an earlier reviewer who mentioned that this book was definitely not for beginners. Whoever edited this book did a very poor job, in my opinion..."
2,Never thought I could win this so called prize!,"I am very disappointed about this book. The color and patterns from this book are very old and conservative, nothing new or exciting about this book. Only one out of the 50 blankets that makes me want to give a try, so you can imaging how boring the book is.Plus, if you know how to make granny square blankets, you probably can win the prize too."
3,Too Heavy,Purchased this stroller as a spare that would be more comfortable than my Maclaren Daytripper. It is a nice stroller but too heavy and should only be used for longer day strips that does not require the sunshade or too much pushing. The sunshade does not cover the baby at all. The positive is the color is nice for a girl and the legrest does allow the child to sleep comfortably which the Maclaren does not. My metrolite is much more comfortable over all and covers her in the sun.
4,high shipping costs,handkerchiefs are great. the shipping cost was extremely high for an item this light in weight.
5,"Excellent; 100% cotton, as described.","High shipping cost almost doubles the price, but you're still getting a great deal for something that's tough to find elsewhere. Go ahead... treat yourself..."
5,All the best on one CD! Fantastic!,"Tracing the entire uncomparable history of the Doobie Brothers, this CD is a real find! Essentially combines the Best of the Doobies (Volumes 1 and 2) and adds a bonus track (live version of Long Train Runnin'). Truly a must have CD for true collectors."
5,Clean Cars,"This will clean your cars and you won't have to towel them off. If you're a lazy guy like me, that will make you happy."
3,Surprisingly mediocre quality of prints,"As a frequent visitor and lover of Italy, I was excited to get this book. I'm still happy that I have it as it does give a birds eye view of many cities that I love, but it also has a tremendous amount of mountain photos that are pretty but redundent. I also found that the quality of the prints was not terrific. Many border on blurry and have a grainy appearance."
3,"Wine, wine and some water","It's big and impressive, but not without flaws. I suspect that some pictures has been enlarged in order to make a part of the original make a big splash on the pages. But that is in my eyes not the largest trouble with this book. Much worse is that some editor must love Alpine peaks and coastline more than anything else. These two subjects are given a large chunk of the space, I would have liked to see places eerie f√∂r other reasons: historic places of battles, settlements and such, there's no shortage in Italy. But only at the end there are a few pages on the subject, what a shame. But still, you find views of many cities and villages to enjoy. It's hard to resist for an Italophile."
4,A Forbidden Loving by Penny Jordan (Large Print Harlequin),"Description from the book back cover:Of course she hadn't fallen in love with him ... Silas Jardine was only being pleasant to Hazel because she was Katie's mother. Katie was the one he cared about. It would be wrong of Hazel to think otherwise. The trouble was, she had forgotten how to behave in the company of an attractive man and was over-reacting. That was what Hazel told herself in an effort to convince all concerned that Silas's eruption into her life was something she could take in her stride. She could only pray that Silas hadn't noticed the effect he was having on her ..."
4,Great gift!,"I bought this book as a gift for my mother. English is her second language and, although she can write very well, she sometimes has a hard time finding the right words or expressions to use. This book is very easy to use as it is broken down to different occasions: personal, business, and many more. It's so popular with her and her friends that she asked me to order some more so she can give them as gifts, too."
4,Good overview of author's work on status of firms,"This is a good overview of the author's conception of status. That is provided in the introductory chapters. There is absolutely no grand theorising in the book, everything is empirically driven and several previously published studies are described in later chapters. For tbose of you who have read some of the author's academic articles, this book is valuable because this time he is very clear in defining what he means with status (and how it is different from reputation).It would have been nice with a bit more deep and fundamental discussion of status in the first couple of chapters. However, that is another book. The target audience for this book is only academics studying organizational theory."
5,Long live Chuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was unknowingly to be the last studio album to be given to the metal world by this metal visionary. Your death was untimely my friend but your spirit will live on in this and all your albums.Intricate guitar work is a specialty here and if you like heaps of talent along with your metal, then buy this along with all of Death's and Control Denied's albums. Chuck R.I.P. but live forever in my heart!"
4,"Good, but not their best...","This is an excellent album and all Death fans should pick it up, however, it's not as good as some of their past work (Human & Individual Thought Patterns). The musicianship is very strong (as always) but the songs are not that inspiring. I still find myself putting Human in my CD player whenever I'm in a ""Death mood,"" not TSOP."
1,"The ""death"" of good metal!","Some dude at the CD store was looking at different albums by this band called ""Death"" so I asked him if they were any good. He said, ""Yeah they're brutal! They're one of the best metal bands EVER!!"" so under his recommendation I bought ""Sound of Perseverance"". I put it in my new 2001 CD player and was expecting some tr00 metal. Man, I was so disappointed. All the songs sound the same, the guitar riffs are Metallica ripoffs, the drums sound like tin cans and the vocals sound like a crying angsty teenager.For real metal listen to new Metallica, KoRn, Slipknot, Limp Bizkit, As I Lay Dying, Trivium and Job For A Cowboy!"
5,"Genious, although Symbolic was at an higher grade","Chuck Schuldiner was and still is [God bless his soul], my moral mentor in musical notes, at least in what concerns, and I am proud to say it, Heavy Metal music. He always was the mastermind behind Death, and you can perceive it through its notes in every Death recording. I wish he was still alive, 'cause I know that I would follow the career no matter what. I mean Can you trust anyone better than Schuldiner in this stage of metal music. It could only improve with age...To the heart of his music I will carry the torch that lifts every heavy metal spirit that is willing to listen to this man's thoughts and ideas.Greetings to all who took part in his journey."
5,Death's Last Great Album,"Death was and always will be one of the heavy metal's all times greatest bands. Believe it or not they're already becoming one of my all time favorite bands, and now I've got all their albums. Sound Of Perseverance is simply awesome. The amazing guitar solos, the thick bass lines, the wonderful drumming, and of course Chuck Schuldiner's vocals and thoughtfully written lyrics are just what makes this album a true and pure work of art. Every song on here is great especially the Judas Priest cover of Painkiller. If you're love Death, get this album now, hey get all of their albums.Rest In Peace Chuck SchuldinerLet The Metal Flow my friend!"
5,Unbelievable,"I cannot imagine music being much better than this. The musicianship is unbelievable, especially the drumming. I'm a big Gene Hoglan fan, but this Richard Christie guy is amazing. Anyway, this is, by far, the best music Schuldiner has created. Not your typical ""death metal"". I'd classify it as progressive death metal. It's heavy (of course) with mesmerizing guitar riffs, constant tempo changes, and thought-provoking lyrics. This album will not bore you. I've listened to it almost daily since I got it in 1999, and I get bored easily."
3,Not quite what I was hoping for.,"Death has always been a band you could count on for an awesome release. This album falls just a little short of that. It sounds like it was rushed or something. The mix on the drums isn't very good, the whole album sounds kind of tinny, and Chuck's new voice takes a little getting used to.If you're a fan it should definitely be in your collection, if you're new to Death, what can I say, you've missed out on alot of fun years. What I'd like to hear is a mixture of Leprosy and Symbolic with the eeriness of Scream Bloody Gore!"
3,The magic is gone,"I will not detail each and every song of this release, but to sum it up, this album is just ok. It is certainly not of bad quality musicianship but the magic is missing and that has got to do with the sound and the compositions. The songs are hardly catchy, the guitars are too raw, there are hardly any effects in the solos which makes them boring and sometimes plain noisy. Besides, the songs are too long and the second part of each song is merely a copy-paste of the first part.However the general atmosphere is still aggressive and the voice spits venom. The drummer is quite good but again the production makes the toms sound too low in the mix, only the double bass is audible. Probably the best drum sound in Death's discography would be on Spiritual Healing because it's so crystal clear and to the point.I have probably reviewed this item before, but in 2012 this is just one record that is not on my playlist except for tracks such as Bite the pain and Spirit crusher."
3,My least favorite Death album,"I just cant get into this album as much as any other Death album. I find myself reaching for their earlier CD's instead of their newer stuff. What is going on with Chuck's voice here ? He sounds like a black metal wanna be vocalist. I just dont care for the ultra-high shrieks, compared to his classic style. There are some really good songs on this album: Scavanger of Human Sorrow, Flesh and the Power it Holds, and another one here and there, but some songs just seem disjointed and dont flow too well. Regardless, this is a good album by a once great artist."
2,Maybe I just don't get it...,"I bought this album years ago and I've probably only listened to it 3 or 4 times all the way through. There's just not much about it that I find entertaining. I am more of a ""brutal"" death metal fan, than technical death metal, so that may play some part in it. I keep trying to give it another chance because it seems like everyone and their mother loves this album. I just hate the vocals and the music is very light sounding to me. There are a few catchy riffs here and there, but the long melodic solos just bore me to death. No pun intended. I warn anyone that is new to Death to give it a listen before buying it. It's not what you would expect from a death metal band. I only give it two stars out of respect for the band. Otherwise, I can't find anything good to say about it."
3,What happened?,I don't like Chuck's voice on this one at all. The James Hetfield delivery also turns me off completely. If you want a truly remarkable Death CD Individual Thought Patterns is the one.
5,This kicks Ass...,"Well what can i say...Chuck is the man..The album is heavy...tight...intelligent..and just like ""Symbolic"" as angry as hell. The technical side is as always amazing...damn good solos,rhythem and mind twisting drums(double bass heaven). I,ll be trashing to this for quite some time...."
5,I can't think of a word that describes this Album.,"....If I could give this more than 5 stars , I would , It's just INCREDIBLE , I'm just getting into Death , And this is my first Death cd , and I love it , I can't WAIT to get Symbolic , and all the cd's before that , Chuck's voice is amazing here , but from what I've heard , It's always been amazing , If your a fan of Death Metal , that isn't repetative and boring like ""Cephalic Carnage"" ( who suck ),get this album , you won't regret it."
5,Chuck Shuldiner is the father of death metal,"Buy this album. If you are a fan of heavy metal, this album must be in your collection. Chuck Shuldiner in my opinion is the founder of death metal. Ever since Scream Bloody Gore, Death has been putting out quality technical metal. Although the lineup is constantly changing, they always manage to release a revolutionary album. The current lineup blends some serious attitude with musical ability that few bands can measure up to. On The Sound of Perseverance, there are numerous bright spots. Too pick out a few, however, everybody should check out ""Flesh and the Power it Holds"", ""Spirit Crusher"", ""Bite the Pain"", and the excellent cover of Judas Priest's ""Painkiller"". The heavy metal world should listen up to The Sound of Perseverance, because it is the way death metal should be."
5,SER√Å QUE ISSO EXISTE ???!!!,"Fenomenal !!! √â a √∫nica palavra que pode definir qualidade deste cd !!! Na minha opinio, Chuck est√° entre os melhores compositores de HEAVY METAL, juntamente com Jon Schaffer (Iced Earth) and Steve Harris (Iron Maiden). Bem, o baterista, Richard ,simplesmente √© um gnio das baquetas, sua velocidade, preciso e sua capacidade de sair do tempo ficam evidentes em todas as faixas deste cd. Este cara √© anormal !!! Se voc quiser ouvir realmente a evoluo do Death Metal, oua esse disco, ele vai ficar no seu Cd player por um bom tempo. Compre J√° !!!"
5,This is the only devotional book I need!,"As the Singles Ministry Director for First United Methodist Church, I use a devotional publicly at least 3 times per week. Initially, I spent a lot of time searching for an appropriate devotional to match my topics, but once I found this book, I stopped searching! It addresses every issue I could possibly hope for and does so three-fold, with a one-line inspirational message, appropriate scripture, and a touching story for each. This book has truly been a lifesaver for me."
5,Well researched and written,"I don't read just a page or two when I pick up this little book. Each devotion contains a verse of Scripture, a wise saying, and an interesting example. I'm happy to recommend this book."
3,Ups and downs,"As an Excel trainer for the past fifteen years, I've seen what does and doesn't work in presenting information to users. There are many good ideas in this book, and deserve being written about. But while some of them are presented well, others sometimes miss the mark.The ones that work give some very helpful information that could be used on the road to mastering Excel. They involve tips that are sure to boost the user's efficiency.But the ones that don't work sometimes portray a solution that is not necessarily the most effective in each case. In those cases, I felt that there were alternatives that would involve fewer steps, fewer keystrokes, or perhaps fewer lines of VBA code.Hopefully those who buy the book will be able to tell the difference between them."
3,Better reference guide than tutorial,"This book, errors and all, can be used very effectively as a reference guide and for problem solving on occasion. As a tutorial this book suffers from poor organization and scenario development. The overall impression is that you are never quite sure of what you are doing - or why - until you have finished.Look at this book for tips and tricks - learn Excel somewhere else."
2,Poorly orgainzed,"The authoer seemed to have written the book baed on what he knows, but not based on the user-friendly level. I found this book very hard to follow and there is a lot of example I was trying to follow, I just couldn't find the options on my computer."
2,Full Of Errors!,"This books, albeit in the beginning was straightforward, gets loaded with errors when you begin to learn combo boxes in Ch. 23. The exercises from the website and the directions from the chapter do not match up and it gets difficult to decipher when developing validation lists and reports. NEEDS SERIOUS REWORK AND ALONG WITH A FRICKEN REFUND!!"
1,Sloppy Examples and editing - Book is waste of time,"Of all the Excel books I consult, the most dismal in quality, accuracy, and clarity, is, without competition, Mr Excel. Time and time again I find myself frustrated with unclear, hard-to-follow text and samples due to mistakes, typos, or just plain sloppiness--on page after page. Anybody with the author's level of education and training should be ashamed to take credit for such a schlocky production and our money should be refunded at double the rate we paid for it. I am a professional analyst consultant and the Mr Excel book is a waste of my time and money."
2,I was disappointed,"As both a long-term book editor and a lover of Excel, I am always on the lookout for good Excel books. An acquaintance showed me ""Mr Excel on Excel"" and I was not impressed.There did not seem to be an easy flow to the information presented. In many cases I had to read the same material several times over to get the gist of what was being said. Had this book crossed my editorial desk, I would have definitely spent more time smoothing out these areas, and making them easier for an audience of all levels. As an advanced Excel user, I'm afraid that beginners to Excel may find it a little difficult to follow at times."
1,Very poorly written,"Poorly organized, not clear, and quite confusing at times. Don't waste your time and money on a book that you'll surely return.There are other great choices here!"
1,most of the tracks should have stayed unissued!!!,I read other reviews and bought this on their recommendation as we are Peter Greene fans. Although a few were good I am not sure the price is worth skipping the rest. Spencer never was funny and these cds prove it again. As my old man says there is a good reason the studios never issued the unissued songs that are coming out today.
3,Creates resistance,"Overall fit and design is as expected. Color was standard white pvc not gray, but that's what i wanted anyway. Would give a higher rating if the inside material components were listed as i don't know if they are drinking water safe. Also, there was a lot of pressure resistance created from the spring, which i tried to adjust to its minimum, but it still created a notably slower water flow. When forward pressure was off, it did stop backward flow as expected."
3,Strange,"It's probably the best Sci-Fi tv show out there. Adventurous and funny. But what gets me is the quality of DVD lots of them are scratched. I returned first set I bought, got second one, it was better, but still have scratches. The first time I bought this dvd set was on ebay, the Chinese version, fake crap, missing some episodes, but dvds where perfect, not a single scratch. That what makes it strange."
3,Some discs ruined,Some of the discs were damaged and wont play the some of the episodes. Other than that great show great special features. Great buy for the most part.
5,SG1 review,"I am totally addicted to Stargate SG1. I found it online after seeing an episode of Sanctuary and Amanda Tapping caught my eye. I did a search and saw tv shows she had been in, watched an episode or two of Stargate SG1 and got hooked.I rate Stargate with a five and highly recommend viewing for all SciFi fans out there. Even though the series is over, the storylines are riveting and the cast is extraordinary, the special features are worth the purchase of the boxed set alone."
2,"Bad packaging, good series","This should have 5 stars, but is lower because of the packaging. I ended up getting a fairly scratched set of dvds the first time, but the second set was much better. The packaging on this is terrible. Cardboard and dvds do not go well together."
5,love it,"if you watched stargate this is a must buy...who needs tv when you can follow sg1 in order!!! never a dull episode. some are romantic, others action packed, and others show how we deal with lose...over all this is great a buy"
2,Great show poor quality disks,"Dont get me wrong I am a big fan of the series and love watching the show. But the quality of the disks and case are the poorest I have yet to see. your not supposed to polish/ wipe off your tv, computer and glasses with polyester and other plasticloth fibers. it will scratch the surface. unfortunatley thats exactly what they did with your discs. the protective sleeves are nothing but plasticloth fibers. if that isnt bad enough the discs themselves are not well made. I dont know if it is the material or the way the laser burned the discs in the factory. but it is so bad it makes some of the disks literally unwatchable."
2,SG1 Complete,"These DVD's are inferior in quality. There are no english subtitles for the hearing impaired. The box is a piece of crap. I had two of the episodes in season one lock up and crash my computer. I had to start the episode at the end and ""rewind"" back to a time spot a little past the lock up point to see the rest of the episode. The only good news is that it is a lot of entertainment for the now vastly reduced price. Had I paid full price when it first came out, I would have been inclined to return it."
5,One of the fortunate ones,"I've received my order, and I actually received all the correct DVDs, and while there are some very minor scratches, I think that all the DVD's will play just fine. The price was unbeatable, and this series is an all time great ranking with StarTrek TNG, IMHO."
1,poor packaging,"I was shocked to find the discs in this set dirty, scratched, and defective the very first episode on disc one froze and skipped after attempting to watch other discs I found the same problems amazon sent another set and again I found the same thing and have sent the second set back..I give up MGM did a bad job with this set its like they scrapped up all their returned discs and shoved them in a big box not caring what conditon they were in..I would not order this set its a complete gamble as to if you will find all discs working and there are a lot of discs"
5,Great Series - But Check Your Purchase,"Stargate: SG-1 is a great series that any sci-fi fan, and even non sci-fi fans, should enjoy. It blends action, humour, adventure, and both serious and lighthearted themes very well. The cast is excellent, the special effects are superb, and the storytelling is, for the most part, top notch.However, this package is rife with problems. As multiple people have noted, the DVDs are prone to arrive scratched. Amazon has been great giving replacements for something that isn't their fault. Furthermore, I just discovered I received disc five of season one twice and no disc one for season two - but it is long past my thirty days for replacement. So do yourself a favour - if you buy this, CHECK IT THOROUGHLY, for scratches and that you actaully have all the discs."
1,Packaging is defective,"Do not buy this boxed set. Buy the slim discs in individual cases. The packaging for these discs is very poor. When I got mine, all (and I mean ALL) the discs had fallen out of the sleeves and were badly scratched. I have never seen such poor packaging for a boxed set. Even the Stargate logo on the front looked like it was put on by a grade 3 student.They should call this the Stargate Coaster collection because that it all the discs are good for. None would play. Avoid at all costs."
3,my complete set was incomplete but all I got played well,I bouught the complete SG-1 set and when it arrived the included program guide listed shows for all ten seasons and the box was full of disks so I did not inscpect them further. After many months of enjoyable viewing when I got to the end I found there were no disks for the end of season 9 and none for season 10. If you buy this set inspect them for completeness while they are still in the refund time period.
2,Disc are scratched and hard to watch,"Stargate is a great show, to bad they had to end, but making it worst is the quality of the sets. Several disc are scratched and couple unwatchable. Chipping on edges and center holes. I have learned from other feedback that the Stargate sets are all like this so returning it would make no difference and would just cost me more with the added return postage. Only thing I can say is I liked the box."
2,Stargate SG-1 Complete Series,"I ordered this product directly from Amazon in the spring of 2012. The online listing said something like ""only 6 left"" when I ordered. I had been watching the product count go down for 3 or 4 months.I paid way more than the current advertised price ($91+), and have had problems with more than one disc on my way through to Season 5, Volume 2, Disc 4 which is completely unplayable.Researching my order revealed that the product was supplied to me by a third-party, not directly from Amazon. I was not asked to review this product or its seller, nor was I informed it wasn't coming directly from Amazon.Based upon examination of a variety of discs in the set I received, my best guess is what I got is NOT new and unused. However, it took me more than 30-days to figure all this out. As I write this review, I am awaiting a response from Amazon to a defective product message sent earlier today."
1,Great show - terrible manufacturing/packaging,"I love Stargate SG-1. It's one of the greatest sci-fi shows of all time. When the price got to a certain level I decided to buy it despite all the negative reviews about scratched discs. Well, about 1 of 5 discs were scratched and many of them were so scratched you could hardly get a reflection off the disc. As some others have stated, I don't think it's the packaging that caused this, I think they were poorly manufactured. The scratches are in a circular pattern and look too severe to be caused by the packaging.I think the overall 4 star rating is ridiculous. Yes the show is great, but I don't know how there are so many 3 to 5 star reviews from people who claim they got sets with scratched discs."
3,Quality matches price,"$90 for 10 Seasons of Stargate SG-1 is cheap. In fact if you think about it it's REALLY cheap.Sadly the quality of those DVDs is matching the price: Cheap (as in poor) production quality. You might need a robust optical drive: Some of my DVDs were recognized my my girlfriends DELL Laptop drive, but not by my MacBook Pros slot-in drive.Don't get me wrong: I still think it's a good offer. Just be warned. :)"
2,Very disappointed with the condition of the DVDs,"I did read the reviews that stated there was a problem with the sleeves damaging some of the DVDs. The reviewers are correct, about a third of the DVDs are scuffed and causes the DVD to skip and/or stop. I am very disappointed. And I was not able to find the ""contact us"" on the Amazon home page to register my disappointment, so the next best thing is to warn other customers about the packaging damaging the DVDs."
3,Finally ...,"We love our Stargate SG-1, but were seriously frustrated for a couple months.It took three tries before we got a fully playable set of DVDs. THREE!!!The packaging leaves a lot to be desired. I mean, really! DVDs sliding into cardboard slots? That's just asking for scratches! They could have at least lined the slots with some kind of slick plastic coating ... Once we finally got a usable set, the second thing we did (after checking ALL the discs) was put them in individual thin-packs; and they didn't take up much more space than the original packaging. 54 thin-packs - how much more would that have cost them?Some of the problem was obviously manufacturing, though. Several of the won't-play discs had no scratches that we could see.All in all, the manufacturer (MGM?) needs to seriously invest in better quality control ..."
1,Wrong Disks,"f you received damaged discs, you don't know how lucky you are.yes you must check for damage on the packaging, check for scratches/marks/pitting and finally...!!!!CHECK THAT YOU HAVE THE CORRECT DISCS!!!!i checked packaging and disc damage when i received it but did not check if the discs them self's were correct, until weeks later when i finished watching the first half and went to watch the second only to find I HAD TWO FIRST HALFS!!! (season 1-5 and then season 1-5 again)i emailed amazon as soon as i discovered this but have not yet had any reply other than emails advertising more dvdsi have purchased many things from amazon before with no problem and normally have only good things to say about them. but if i do not receive a replacement i will not be purchasing any more items.good luck to all shopperscome on amazon help me out here"
2,Disappointing,I bought this and was really pumped to re watch the series again. Got it in 4 days to Australia which was amazing. When I got the box set first I was shocked at the packaging which is 2 book type things set next to each other in a box. The DVD are not separated into seasons so you have to guess what episodes you want to watch. The biggest issue is the packaging on the set in which the dvd's become basically unwatchable. The set looks great on the shelf and once I get the discs buffed it will be a lot better. Amazon where very helpful in dealing with the problem.
5,Love it.....,So glad i decided to buy this...This is my favorite tv show!! Had no scratches but what i did was buy a cd case for this set
4,Mmmmm Stargate.,"Netflix pissed us off by taking this series off of streaming, so we just bought it insteadof paying netflix for an upgraded package.We havn't gotten throught the whole thing yet but have been pleased withevery one of the dvd's so far.It was packaged very well and the collector box it comes in is just cardboard but it is pretty cool too."
1,Do not buy this edition,"This is not a review of the television series, but of the box set.The set is attractively packaged, but unfortunately, the look is deceiving. The discs are slotted in two cardboard fold out booklets and the slots are really rough on the discs. My Vizio and Toshiba DVD players can handle about half the disks, and I have been forced to rip the remaining disks on my computer. That leaves about ten percent of the EPISODES (not the discs) as unplayable - even after careful cleaning and attempts to read the bad discs in two computer disk drives with several computer programs (MakeMKV, Hanbrake, DVDShrink as well as attempting to play with VLC, iTunes, Windows Media player, etc). The scratches on the discs are horizontal, lining up with the edge of the card board pockets they live in and the scratches clearly have come about while the package has been transported. Too bad, this appears to be a great value, but be warned."
2,Nice Show but bad quality control for item,"The star gate series are actually one of the finest, though this item is a let down due to quality issues. In addition to all the complaints posted about the package my set had two discs of season 1 disc 5 and season 2 disc 1 was nowhere to be found. It would have been too much of a hassle to send it back just for that one disc.For a serious collector you would be better off buying the individual seasons rather than this complete series collection."
4,"Great Show Awful, Awful Packaging","The movie was great, so is the show, everyone should buy this.Some problem though...This set could have been perfect if only MGM took the time to package this thing right. I appreciate the neat outside, the box is amazing. However; the box's corners were bent and smashed. Inside the DVDs are kept in ""hard paper"" sleeves and that could scratch the discs. Luckily I haven't had this problem, but I'm only 2 seasons in.I wouldn't recommend this as $200+, hopefully Amazon will put it back on sale again, and put it back to 116."
3,"5 for the series, 1 for the packaging","Stargate SG-1 is a phenomenal series. If you're a sci-fi fan, you owe it to yourself to watch this series in its entirety (as well as Stargate Atlantis and the recently released movies). Five stars.The PACKAGING for this full series box set is abysmal. The outside of the set box looks very very cool, but, as others have said, the discs themselves are packaged in fold-out cardboard sleeves. Due to this, at least one out of every five discs was scratched and unplayable. A return and refund is the route I've chosen to go, and I'm hoping Amazon will be accomodating. One star for the scratched discs and cheapo disc storage.To sum up, as others have stated: SG-1? Brilliant. Box set? Sucks. Three stars.EDIT: Amazon gave me a full refund with no hassle and fast, free at-home UPS pickup. Great customer service!"
2,"Poor quality, inaccurate description- incomplete closed captioning","Although the DVDs are of decent quality, the packaging is not. The open sleeves allow the discs to tumble about during shipping, and as a result many are scratched to the point of being unwatchable. In addition, despite the current description, ONLY seasons 8, 9, and 10 have english closed captioning. Most of the seasons have no language options at all, and only have show in spoken English.If you need closed captioning, do not buy this item! Amazon also sells the SG-1 seasons individually (For a similar price), and all except the first appear to have proper CC."
2,stargate sg1 complete series collection,"This is the 2nd set I've purchased, having same problems as 1st, some DVDs are bad where they freeze or skip over episodes."
1,Happy Birthday! I got you a box of garbage!,"I might as well have put a big red bow on the cat's litter box. This ""complete series"" is supposed to contain two boxes -- Seasons 1-5 and seasons 6-10. WRONG! We got TWO sets of seasons 6-10, and no seasons 1-5.But, really, what difference does it make when so many of the discs are unplayable anyway? I could have just cut out 40 little circles of asphalt roof shingles and shoved them in the ol' DVD player.AND Amazon is saying they can't accept a return, they can only refund because the seller's stock ""changes."" Yet they are still offering the set for sale. What's up with that?"
3,"great series, poor quality discs","I watched the first few discs and they were great. Then I started getting to the discs that skipped ahead or stopped completely only to begin at the beginning. Some had little to no marks on them so it may be within the copy itself. Other discs had obvious defects. There was no way to look at the disc and be able to tell if it would be good or bad, you had to watch the whole thing. I am returning my set and hope to get a better set in return."
5,SciFi Friday At Home,"Simply put, I have been watching Stargate SG1 with my children for years. This brings to our finger tips the episodes we missed and the episodes we miss."
5,Rock Stargate!,"I love Stargate SG-1. This product allows me to keep all my Stargate in one place. The only thing I was disappointed with was the fact that there are no English subtitles, so I have to watch the show where it is really quiet. There is the episode guide indexed by disc so I can easily find the episode I want to watch."
2,Duplicate Discs,I received duplicate discs in season 8 and because I got duplicates some of the discs from season 8 were missing. I didn't notice until after the 30-day return period was up so I called MGM to ask what I could do. He stated that MGM would replace the set for me as long as I mailed the set to them and then provided a copy of my original sales receipt. BUT he told me that it would take at least 8 weeks to get a replacement set of discs. WTF. LOL.
4,"Great Collection. Nice Box, etc.","I enjoy this series, so maybe I am biased as to the product. The box it comes in might be a bit unwieldy, but it looks nice. The discs were not scratched, but I can see how they might become so, the compartments are not exactly ""disc friendly"". I sort of wish that the entire collection was different than the normal season dvd releases, and I wish that they would relabel the disc numbers, they go by the individual season numbers, so it can get complicated. But as for the series ... Amazing."
3,"Great show, bad discs","Like a lot of people I've seen on here say, my discs came scratched and messed us with lots of skips and jumps.The good news is that a scratch fixer (one of those grinder disc cleaners) will work and fix it after a few rounds.The bad news is, I shouldn't have to buy a secondary product to enjoy my primary product."
1,Tried again a year later and still junk...,Bought this set last year for the wife from Christmas - Many of the disc were scratched so I sent it back. After a snafu with Amazon we ended up just getting our money back..and told the wife I would replace it someday when the fix they packaging prob. When I saw this for $99 I bought it again (heck of a price) Then I gave it to her again for Christmas. (she laughed!) This time though - EVERY DISC was scratched BADLY. Unbelievable! I have submitted for a replacement hoping to get one of the 'mystery sets' with no scratches. For $99 I will play this game but for the full price - no way - you would be better off buying the thin packs.
4,A Consumer Review,"I purchased this collection for my fiance for Christmas in 2008. He's had it for over a year so I thought it was about time I got down to reviewing it. I did a lot of research on Amazon before purchasing it and wanted to make an informed consumer decision. I ordered it through Amazon and it arrived quickly in a box where it was surrounded with air pockets. When he opened it I did have him check each disk for scratches. Everything was in pristine condition. My only gripe, and this is a preference thing, is that the disks are all different colors. I would have prefered if each season was a different color. Be careful with this box set, the disks will slip out if tipped over."
4,Word to the wise.....,"Hang on to your packing slip and make sure you watch the entire set before the 30 day return period. I didn't and when I discovered that what was labeled as Season 10, Disc 4 was actually Season 7, Disc 1, Amazon would only either give me a partial refund or 25% of the purchase price for the disc. So I would have to but an entire season to get one disc."
5,Loved it!!,"It arrived exactly on time exactly as ordered. Loved it. We haven't watched it all but, would suggest it to anyone who loves StarGate."
2,disapointed,The subject matter is awsome I knew what I was getting before buying it. Problem is quality some of the discs dont work which is a bummer
1,WAITING,I would really like to purchase this set but I'm going to wait untill the problem with the disks gets corrected.
3,"So sad, shoddy disc quality","5 STARS for the product.5 STARS for the price -- which is nice.1 STAR for quality.While nearly everything about this set is excellent, many of the discs play poorly or not at all on 2 out of 3 of my DVD players.While one of the three DVD players is older and has had an occasional problem in the past, it has never been anything like this.The second player that experiences hiccups is a complete surprise.The third works fine.Still, because of this limitation, I've taken to ripping the episodes and watching them via my iPod setup so that I can actually get through a show without terrible stutter or freezes."
2,Only Have Gotten Half of Stargate SG-1,"I only have gotten half of Stargate SG-1. I watched all the discs in the first set of the series (which took me over a month to watch all of them) until I noticed I didn't have the discs of the last 4 seasons with the bonus discs. Instead I gotten 2 copies of Season 1 to Season 5, and the first 2 discs of Season 6 but no disc 3, 4, or 5 of Season 6, or no Season 7, 8, 9, 10, or the bonus discs. Now I have to get the rest of the seasons separate and regain the money that I saved up for this collection set. I don't recommend buy this collection set or from any of Amazon's third-party sellers. Just buy all the seasons separate from the official Amazon store."
1,Bad description made me to buy,"I Love Stargate SG1, when i find out this full serie package, i was very happy because i missed so many episodes; the i saw the description from amazon and it was specifically written that is has (at least) spanish subtittle (I speak spanish), and it's very difficult to me to understand spoken english when they speak fast; so confident with the idea of the subtitles i bought the serie, the firs season was awsome (because they even speak in spanish), boy when i hit season to and beyond it is only in english with no subtitles at all !!, noy i have a complete useless serie. Thanks Amazon for making me waste my money."
2,review of stargate sg - 1,"hello. As you've asked me to review this product i will take the opportunity to tell you i was quite disappointed with it. Not the box set itself, but the fact that you did not state what zone it was from. As i am from Australia the discs did not play and i had to buy a new mutli zoned dvd player just to play theses discs. Perhaps in the future you can be more transparent with your ads and state all the specifications needed to play them. thank you"
5,Made a great x-mas gift,"I bought this for my grandfather! I was very happy to see that the price was under $100, compared to over $300 at the local Best Buy. Packaging was ok, box could have been a little bigger. But overall a great buy."
5,Christmas gift,I purchased SG-1 as a Christmas gift for some friends. The husband just loves the series. The wife says he watches it for hours on end. Just like a kid with a new toy. She said the box it comes in is beautiful. They both enjoy the series.
5,Perfect,"After reading all the reviews about the condition of not only the box, but the disks, I was of course very hesitant to order this box set. I finally ordered it, and I have to say, that every disk is perfect, every label as it should be and the box is in perfect shape. All in all this is an amazing deal. I am not sure if I just lucked out, or if they have fixed the problems that are so prevalent with the other reviews."
4,"Check your disks ... ""Indeed!""","I received my set in mid-October'09 and this evening finished watching the last one. I was lucky since, apparently, the DVDs did not move around in the poorly-designed cardboard slots. Only a few had what appeared to be cosmetic scratches.Many of the episodes exhibited repeated pixellation and/or freezes and several disks sounded like they were unbalanced. I was able to ""work thru"" all of this except for Disk 5 of Season 9 which produced very bad vibrations in my DVD player before it declared it to be unplayable.Overall, for the price, I am satisfied with the product and was happy to be able to experience the series episodes in order."
5,Stargate DVD,"We ordered this for our son. He is very happy with the product. It is of the highest quality, and it came very quickly."
3,"great show, ok dvds","Stargate SG-1 - The Complete Series CollectionMake sure the seller is selling you a USA version of this collection. The one I got was from china, no bonus disks or book, the packaging is much better than what others have said, but you don't get any bonuses."
2,Damaged and dirty dvd's,I was highly dissappointed to have to clean and scub numerous dvd's in order to get them to play. I did pay for a brand new item from amazon. I expected much better. I should have read and believed other reviews but there is no other way that I found to get this complete series at this price. Buyer beware on this one!!.
3,Damaged disks,"The series is great, I'm a bit disappointed that some of the disks have bad sectors, which means that on some of the disks the PC and DVD player will skip section of the damaged disks....Jos"
1,Product returned for refund.,"Promptly checked the discs and found all but a quarter of them to be ""used"" or even ""abused"" in condition. The sleeve design is crappy (I didn't have any discs rolling around loose in the box, like some customers have, but a few were about half-way out of their sleeves while others were jammed-in excessively tight), but the extent of damage on a number of these discs went beyond what I've seen even with rental DVD's. Clearly a quality control problem in the production stage.Thankfully, Amazon refunded my money."
3,SG1,"The show it's self is wonderful, the packageing is terrible. The disks were all out of wake and had scratches on them, almost every disk pauses at least once, the box is already coming apart. Very bad packageing!"
5,Open the iris....,"Ok.. I bought this as a birthday gift to myself, even after reading the negative reviews about dirty scratched discs that were unplayable. I can say that after 3 months, I finally watched the complete series and didn't have a single problem. Granted the discs are in cardboard pockets in a large book-like holder so yes there is bound to be some dirt/dust on them. All I did was put them through my disc cleaner and... voila' !! This was probably the best gift I ever received for my birthday. If you're a true Gate Fan, this is for you!!!"
1,stargate 1 complete series,"I also brought the series, of stargate 1 complained about them, got another set, but they were also the same,didn't complain about them I should have,they were also the same as the first very poor scratches on everyone not very happy about this as they were not cheap. Would have liked them to be of good quality, have not had bad DVD'S from they except with these 2 sets, not a happy camper I can tell you, I think Amazon should do something about this or else it will continue to go on and on.I can not keep returning them as I live in Australia and the postage is not cheap"
4,Great product,"Like many other people the DVDs were pretty scratched upon arrival due to horible packaging design. I had decent luck, only 1 disc didnt work. All the scratches are buffed surface scratches. I have some repair stuff to try on the disc that doesnt work since it looks like small surface damage."
3,Stargate Complete Series-Hopeful,"I have not had a chance to watch many of the episodes. When I opened the package the inside of the lid was disgustingly odorous with whatever type of glue they had used. There was glue specks on the discs, I will have to purchase a disc cleaner before I can use them in my dvd player. My boyfriend is rather disappointed because this is a birthday gift to me from him. Can't wait to watch them!"
1,Only 4 intact discs out of the ENTIRE SET,"Bought these at Fry's. They go back tomorrow. Out of the entire set, there were only four discs that didn't *arrive* with scratches; a couple of them only slightly, most of them badly. The very first disc wouldn't play right out of the box; it began stuttering about two hours in on the first play. The worst discs actually look like somebody dropped them in gravel, then stepped on them a little.That's almost a 93% damaged disc rate out of the box.MGM should recall this collection ASAP.More details below the fold (click ""Comments"")."
4,Great for fans of the series,"The series was great. Had its ups and downs, but it's still worth the time. It's too bad they didn't include the languages selections in all DVDs like they did with season 1, 'cause it made it almost impossible for people who do not understand english to understand the plots. I wanted to share this with my nephew and it was difficult because he's only learning basic english right now. The other thing is the package. The dvds are not secured to the package and I received them out of the cases due shipping I guess. Some of the dvds are scratched but it doesn't cause them to skip or freeze, thank god.Excellent series, though, and this is a great opportunity for fans of the show."
1,Be very careful before purchasing,"The quality of these disks are very poor. Many are damaged and skip and freeze. Because of the size of the disk set, I didn't discover the problem until it was too late to get it taken care of. If you decide to order this set anyway, make sure that you check every disk upon arrival so that you have a chance of getting any damage taken care of. I am very disappointed with the order and the lack of response in getting the problem fixed. The 4 star rating fooled me into a sense of security and unfortunately I didn't read the reviews before purchasing this set. This appears to not be an isolated problem, but one that many others have had."
2,Geat TV Series / Piss Poor Packaging,"The TV series is great & I was looking forward to a couple of months of SG-1 viewing. BUT, when I opened up the boxed set, the dvds came rolling out! If ever there was a failure in packaging, this is it! About 3/4 of the dvd's were out of their cardboard pockets (bad idea to begin with!). Upon closer inspection, I found 11 dvd's that my player rejected as ""disc not readable"" & 18 discs that were scuffed up very badly! So, I had to contact Amazon & request a refund. Excellent customer service. They sent me a return shipping label & my refund will post back into my bank account as soon as they receive the dvd's back. I though about repurchasing another set from another source, but after reading how so many other people have experienced the same problems with the way the dvd's are packaged, I'll pass & purchase each season separately. More costly, but at least the dvd's will arrive in great condition!"
3,Good Series,"This is a good series, but the packaging lets it down. I ordered a few for my friends but some dvds were scratched. So prob only buy if a new package is released."
2,Disappointed,"There were approximately 54 discs in the set making the package somewhat heavy. The Discs were not in jewel cases or paper sleeves, but rather in cardboard slots. Each of the discs in the bottom slots were scratched. Some of the scratches were pretty significant. It was difficult to tell if the damage was done during shipping because of the weight or if they were already damaged prior to shipping. The damaged discs that I checked do play, but the player had to correct some errors and there was some loss of the picture quality. If you purchase this set of discs you would be well advised to buy a product called Disc Doctor that will resurface the disc removing scratches and other imperfections that cause the disc to skip or drop pixels. If it didn't cost so much to ship these discs back then I would have done it. As it is it would cost more to ship them back than they are worth.I am quite disappointed with this purchase."
4,good product,"I have been enjoying this product. I found no fault with the disks as others have found, but I agree that the packaging of the disks in paper sleeves is unacceptible. The first thing I did was to place the entire series into individual sleeves. Due to the packaging it would be absolutely necessary to check the condition of all the disks upon purchase."
2,:(,I bought it for my father who does not know English. It has no subtitles. It doesn't even have captions. I was a bit disappointed.
1,"Clearly used, not new. Arrived with ever disc scratched and dirty.","My complaint is NOT about the product but about the seller (Amazon).This product was advertized by Amazon (the seller) as NEW and it arrived shrink-wrapped. But every disc was scratched. Nearly every disc had dirt, smudges and fingerprints on it. I nearly returned it and then thought about the hassle I would face. So I bought a battery-powered disc cleaner and did it myself. Amazon, you might want to select your vendors more carefully!"
2,Scratched Disks,"I got several disks scratched. The main reason: the poor packing. Initially in Amazon it was announced that the disks had Spanish subtitles. This was not true. Only the seasons 1, 8,9, and 10 has Spanish subtitles."
3,MN housewife,"The SG1 complete series is one of the better long term series we have purchased. My family is enjoying it very much. Only problem we are haveing as we enter season 3 of the 10 year series is that the DvD quality has deminished, they seem pitted, lag out and skip sections at times just plainly unwatchable. In calling Amazon for a replacement, there was nothing they could do as it has been over 30 days since our purchased of July 16th. We can only hope that it is only a few of the DvD's of the 54 that are bad. It is frustrating to be watching a show and continually have a problem with it."
3,blue ray,hey do you want a lot of buyers for this series then release them in blu ray along with the rest of the stargate franchise!!!!
5,Ignore the naysayers,"I bought this before I read the product reviews, and I'm glad I did, because I probably wouldn't have bought it after reading all the bad things about the packaging and disc scratches. Well the package arrived today and after checking all the discs, I can't find any major damages, only a few slight scratches that didn't affect playback at all. Bottom line: If you are a Stargate fan, this is the best thing you can buy, and it's worth every penny."
2,Very scratchy for a Box set so expensive,"I bought this for Christmas for my husband, almost every disk is scratched, some won't play in DVD player have to play in computer. For what I paid for this I am very disappointed in it though do NOT blame Amazon as it came this was from manufacturer it was in the box and wrapped."
3,Guess you get what you pay,Several ive seen have complained about the scratches on these CDs. And as far as i can tell its cause by the packaging granted its a really cool idea how to get all these CD's in such a small box but as it ships its scratching the cds. there placed in these cardboard sleeve and the paper smooth side it whats holding the cd. Any Major Bumping will loosen the cd having them rub against other cd's and the packaging. lucky for me only a few in the first few seasons had major scratches to where they would not play and since i already owned the first two season i didnt bother returning because all the rest was fine. few more had minor scratches but they played all the way through. I quickly got cd sleeve to place them back into instead of the packaging it came in
4,Stargate SG1 The complete series collection,Love all the series of Stargate. of the 54 discs in this collection there were 4 which were so badly scratched I needed to take them to a disc repairers.However that takes nothing away from the actual program itself.
4,"Great value, better packaging needed.","You certainly can't fault this package for good value, and at this price it makes purchasing DVD collections a very reasonable option. The actual packaging leaves some room for improvemet; many, nay all of the discs have become marred by the cardboard sleeve - leaving a straight edged mark on the disc surface.Thanks to the available DVD rips on the Internet however, this issue is largely mitigated. The content producer gets their revenue, and I get a convenient, high quality playable content."
3,"Great show, terrible packaging.","It's unfortunate that the packaging of this is so horrible. It's an excellent show, definitely one I never get tired of seeing, but almost every disc was scratched. Most of the discs were still usable, but I ended up replacing the 5th season because of the disc damage. It was still a great deal, even after replacing one of the seasons, but I feel that I got lucky that more of the discs weren't damaged beyond use."
3,Stargate SG1 10 Season Boxset,"This product sells for $299 locally so for $81 it is great buying. However like others on this site I must comment on the packaging, yes I too have scratched discs, so far the ones I have tried do play OK. I have sent Amazon a photo of a typically damaged disc just in case I have problems further down the set. I suggest that if you buy this set also buy 6 piece DVD cases to store the discs.Something else to note, the packaging states that season 1 is 4x3 letterbox, when I played the first disc it was 16x9, so that is a bonus. the quality of the video image was also excellent."
2,AVOID this set,"Although Stargate SG-1 was a wonderful television series, I can state, without perjury, that my VHS collection, recorded off of network television, is in MUCH BETTER SHAPE than these DVD'S.Except for a handful of discs, this collection is in TERRIBLE shape.I had not only found an abundance, of scratches, INSIDE of the discs, but some of my discs do not play due to some sort of ""milky white"" substance, which was ""splashed"" on the disc, prior to its being sealed.Amazon.com was very good about giving me a refund, on this item, but I suggest that, if a person wants to own stargate, they should buy one season at a time, and check for defects, such as mentioned here, before buying another set.This ""complete set"" is NOT worth the cost savings, over buying individual seasons."
5,"Perfect Condition, FAST Delivery","I was skeptical at all the advertisement looking titles this guy got in all his reviews, but there's no better way of putting it. I got my item for about $100 less than original price, and it was delivered really fast through US Postal Service. The item was also in mint condition."
1,bad seller,"I am not able to review this item since I never received it. There was a mistake in the address and it never reached me. When I discovered this mistake, I tried to contact the seller but was unable to find even an email. There is no means of communication with seller that I was able to find. I even went as far as contacting the postal service and they put a request in with the shipper to contact me, but there was no attempt at communication whatsoever!!! I will be very uneasy to ever buy from Amazon in the future and if I do I will look for contact information to the seller first and only then place an order."
1,"awesome item, but dont buy off amazon","i LOVE stargate sg-1so i bought thisthe garunteed it to come december 24th, in time for christmasit didnt comeand not come until i had to call amazonthey said that they lost the package and that if i wanted it id have to pay more for it.Amazon didnt care one bit about it garunteeing stuff"
2,Waste of time! Pain in the Ass!,Someone spent a lot of time creating the container. That person is very talented and needs to GET A LIFE! Too much glitz Dude!
5,Very nice,Having seen all the previous reviews on this having dirty and scratched disc's I was a bit nervous on ordering this for my wifes birthday. But I am very pleased with this and the DVD quality. Seems they have fixed the dirt and scratched issues. All disc's are in very nice condition.
2,Worst packaging Ever!,Great Series! packaged by a cereal box fanatic-who ever thought this package up should be Zatted 3 times. what a waste!!!
2,incomplete set,I wanted to purchase the complete series of sg-1. I also did not want to worry about the condition of a used set so I purchased a new one BUT there were still mistakes (missing discs and duplicates of enclosed discs). It made me wary of on-line purchases of DVD sets.
3,"Love Stargate, but very poor product.","This product came with all DVD's for 10 seasons, But the problem is, over half of them have some sort of scratch or gouge in the surface of the disk, I am very upset that amazon places this item under review less than 24 hours after I purchase the product, and still sends me the defective product, and of course - I cannot return it for a replacement because they placed it under review. I can only get a refund, which isn't worth waiting 2 weeks for a $100 deposit on my credit card when I can get the discs resurfaced for less.Good game Amazon, I will never shop here again."
3,"Good show, needs better packaging","Well, for starters this is a great show and I have enjoyed watching it. But, as many before have said, the packaging needs some serious improvement. A large number of disks were scratched (one was even unplayable). Consider this before making your purchase."
1,Disgraceful Packaging,"I decided to take a risk buying this as some reviewers had stated that they had received their box sets in excellent condition. Well, I will never take such a risk again. Many of the discs had not only been damaged badly in transit, but also had severe manufacturing scratches, as if the discs had spun out of control and created circular scars on the discs.I have returned the box set back to Amazon and await my refund.Avoid this."
1,Don't purchase this set!!!!!,"Stargate SG-1 is awesome, unfortunately the quality of this set is horrifying! It was received with many of the DVD's damaged (scratched, dirty, pitted) but due to the size of the set I did not find the first, of many, DVD's that are damaged until after the Return period had expired. The packaging of the set is just terrible, there is no protection for the DVD's, it is just cardboard holders. If you do purchase this item, make sure you check every single DVD immediately."
2,Poor packaging leaves discs badly scratched,"I hope this was a one-time error (and I'm certainly going to be returning my copy of this set), but almost every single disc in the collection came through dirty, scratched, or both. Not all of them are unplayable, but I was ""lucky"" enough to discover that the very first one of them I attempted to play was indeed unplayable. Maybe it's because of the packaging, which is a bunch of cardboard sleeves that don't provide any safety to the disc whatever.The set itself is exciting -- but no DVD is exciting if you can't play it. (And I tried four different DVD players, computer and standalone.)ETA: My replacement copy is much, much better. Every disc I've looked at has been in perfect condition, and the unplayable disc from the first time around is just fine this time. Thanks to Amazon for a swift and painless replacement!"
1,Best you avoid this one,"Stargate SG-1 was a great series, which is what makes it so much more unfortunate that I feel the need to advise anyone thinking about buying this series set not to do so.Perhaps it's the packaging, but the disks seem to arrive in bad shape. I ordered this set, it arrived, and many of the disks were scratched and unplayable. I sent an exchange request, and a new set was quickly sent to me. Unfortunately, this new set was in even worse shape.Now I'm just going to get a refund. It's a shame, but if you are smart, you will NOT buy this set."
2,"Terrible Packaging, skipping disks, great show.","This show is wonderful, I love it. However, the packaging is unacceptable. The box is damaged and the disks are scratched and skip sometimes. Quite disappointed."
3,Stargate SG-1: could have been worse,"Fortunately I had read several other reviews of this product before I ordered it. I had pre-purchased slim-pak DVD cases and repackaged the whole thing as soon as it arrived. The disks were not particularly dirty but approximately 10 have a ""smudge"" manufactured into them, it does not wipe off. I tested these disks and they play on my old, no frills DVD player so I'm happy. I would probably rate the content at 4.5 because I really enjoy this series, but the packaging left a lot to be desired. It was cute but not serviceable. Too bad."
3,Good Series Bad disks,After setting the order it was sent to me very quickly however by the time i reached about the third disk i already have seen skipping and it continues on almost every disk. I see that amazon has gotten many of these same reviews and are doing something about it because it really is a shame it is not available. also be careful if you have purchased a damaged package you can not exchange for another while they are still investigating as i have found out and am currently waiting for them to resolve the issue hopefully in time for me to send it in to be replaced.
1,Scratched DvD`S,"When i opened the package for the first time some of the dvds were loose, and almost all the dvds were scratched."
2,A bit disappointed,"Stargate SG-1 - The Complete Series CollectionI got this for my son for a Christmas gift as he is a fan. Unfortunately, one of the discs is missing and one is a duplicate. The show itself is enjoyable and I have watched the episodes with his but the disc missing was a season finale!"
5,Stargate SG1 Seasons 1-8,My favourite Sci-Fi series.Owned and gave away 2 collections of this series ( seasons 1-8 ) so that my friends in Malaysia & Philippines can share my enjoyment.Hope this complete set comes with subtitles.
1,I tried...,First set had skips in several of the disks - one episode a character had no sound - Amazon was quick to send a replacement! - replacement has the exact same issues - I am returning both today unfortunately. Kudos to Amazon for their great customer service though! Replacement and returns were handled with no hassle whatsoever!
2,Believe the reviews on the packaging,"I thought, ""OK, some of the disks come scratched, but how bad can it really be?""The answer is, ""Shockingly bad.""This packaging should go down in DVD history as one of the dumbest ideas ever. DVDs are sandwiched into cardboard sleeves that only cover half the disc. This is not enough to hold the discs in place during shipping, so they fall in and out of the sleeves, getting scuffed in the process. Some managed to get serious radial scratches, which is about the worst thing that can happen to a DVD.Whoever designed this packaging should be fired.I am going to try playing all the discs before sending this back because I have no confidence that I won't get exactly the same result with another set. The packaging just about guarantees damage.You'd be better off downloading episodes from torrent sites than buying this and that would serve MGM right. The price is good, but I would gladly have paid $20 more for decent packaging and undamaged discs."
2,Poor packaging.,"This would be an awesome set if the disks wouldn't be scratched beyond being playable.Got a set a few weeks ago. it was extremely horrible. most disks would not even load up at all, not even to the main menu. some would load but skip and freeze. All disks are badly scratched.If each disk would be put into a paper sleeve and then put into the pockets in the box then it would had been ok.poor packaging on this set. do not buy it.amazon wil ship you another set but then all the disks in that one could be scratched as well.I returned mine only because amazon did not have another one to send to me right away."
2,"Good series, terrible packaging","I was very excited to finally be purchasing this collection set. I love the series. I was very, very disappointed with the packaging. It had nothing to do with the retailer that shipped it to me. The discs are stored in cardboard sleeves that are just barely big enough to hold them. As a result, many discs have spots along the back that make portions unreadable. I thought at first I would just grin and bear it since I'd already seen the entire series and missing a disc wasn't going to matter, but more and more started to have the same problem. I ended up returning it because so many discs were affected. I've heard that sometimes the discs are in perfect working order, if yours are, I'd recommend going out immediately and buying a new case to store the discs in and just leave the pretty packaging empty."
1,"Awesome series, returned due to every 3rd disc being damaged","I received series as gift and hoped they fixed this problem by now. As of mid July, this was not the case. I checked a few at random and noticed that every 3rd disc was damaged. This happens to also be the one at the bottom of each cardboard sleeve. Wish I had time to spend ordering a second set and reviewing the 9000+ minutes of video. I would also be willing to spend a little more to have these verified before sending. Would be worth an extra 10-20 dollars to have someone else make sure I am not getting a bad product. Hopefully they will listen to us and fix this or just provide all of them in a simple spindle that guaranteed quality with no frills."
3,Ok,"Well, I do enjoy the Stargate series. I have seen the problem others speak of in re scratched up discs. These discs do NOT play on my Samsung player, however, my PS3 has no problem with the scrathes and reading through them. This is my only complaint, the quality of the discs themselves leaves much to be desired. I would NOT suggest buying this set if alternatives are not available for playing them."
1,Bad Disks,I'm about halfway through season 3 and about every other disc in the set has not worked properly. The ritual now is that i switch from my DVD player to my Laptop with the discs. I have tried the discs in a Playstation 2 as well. Now the discs are acting poorly on my laptop. Frankly this getting quite irritating. The discs seem like they are almost in near perfect condition. However they have a hard time being read.I advise anyone who is looking at this item DO NOT PURCHASE!!
1,Horrible Packaging,"I ordered one version of this series, having waited over two years and hoping that MGM had worked out their disc issues. That version was dirty and scratched, so I sent it back. The second set that was sent was worse than the first one.MGM says they value the Stargate series as much as they value the Bond series, but I highly doubt that after seeing these discs. If they value this show so much, the least they could do is put them in a decent set that wouldn't damage hundreds of dollars worth of valuable discs.I am highly disappointed- I have wanted these for a long time and waited until the price dropped so that I could buy them. I guess I'll have to wait more years to get this series."
3,"The Collection is Great, the Packaging Horrible!","I bought this collection after my brother (who lives 1000 miles away) raved about it. Love it. It is so wonderful to be able to go on a marathon and watch all the episodes in a row over a month.The packaging is terrible and I can completely understand the issues that caused many to rate this set low. I was fortunate. My disks arrived in great shape and play perfectly. Both my Mom and sister have played the entire series without mishap. However, the package is awkward and doesn't fit my DVD shelf. Having just cardboard to hold the disks also subjects it to the potential of scratches, something you don't get with other kinds of packaging.If you are willing to risk having to ship it back to Amazon and have them send you another copy (which may have the same issue), go for it. Very economical over the separate seasons.Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection"
1,"Great price, worst.packaging.ever.","Bought this because I'm a big Sci-Fi fan, and I wanted to collect all of SG1. The price couldn't have been better, and I soon found out why. Out of 54 discs, maybe five didn't have a single scratch. A good third of the rest had deep circular scratches that looked like they had been damaged during manufacture. Also the layout had no logic to how the discs were inserted. I requested a refund and will be mailing this back promptly. In my opinion MGM dropped the ball completely, they should have used the thin jewel cases and could have fit all the discs in an ever so slightly bigger box."
2,Disks are damaged,"Unfortunately, in this instance, you do get what you pay for. The disks are in tight-fitting cardboard sleeves. Even taking great care to remove them, found 10 that were damaged before they were even played. The scratches made it impossible to watch most of those disks. Maybe you'll get lucky and find a good batch."
1,Very Poor Packaging,"This set was in a package not really designed for shipping. For starters, the discs are in stiff cardboard sleeves. They slid in and out of the sleeves during shipping which resulted in scratched up playing surfaces as soon as the mint from package was opened. The other problem is that the glue holding one of the sleeves to the main box came loose which resulted in more ""stuff"" sliding around and causing scratches on the discs which had slid out of the other sleeves!"
3,"Love the content, but the packaging sucks!","Buyers beware! It is a great deal on a great series, unfortunately, the packaging is horrendous. Upon opening the box, half of the DVDs had fallen out of the poorly designed sleeves. Almost every DVD had scuff marks, some worse than others, not a single DVD looked new.I had read other reviews about the packaging and decided the price was worth the risk. I ran the really bad DVDs through a DVD doctor, and promptly placed them in a CD/DVD case. You will not want to store this set in its' original container. I am about half way through season 5, so far only one episode has skipped. I did have one DVD that would not play on an older DVD player. It did, however, play on my ps3 and newer BLUERAY player."
1,Discs all scratched up,"Buyer beware! It looks pretty from the outside, but the discs inside are all scratched up."
2,Stargate SG-1 is a great show but box set is terrible,"I am a fan of the show and I was happy the price of the complete series box set went down to $80. However I am not a fan of the box set packaging. When I got it, some of the DVDs almost fell out from the cardboard sleeves and there were DVDs that had scratches. I was able to get a replacement box set but again the DVDs had scratches. I decided to return both sets and get a refund. I do not blame Amazon for the cause. They did their best to wrap the box set with bubble wrap to prevent harm to the DVD.Amazon should consider halting this box set if it causes this much headache. It is unacceptable that DVDs are package poorly that it causes damage to itself. I hope MGM can update the box set and wrap DVD in plastic sleeves or put DVDs in a thin pack case."
4,"Excellent price, Great show, Weak packaging","I read almost every review posted about this set, decided to take the risk. The show is great! The price is great! The packaging...well, you know.With that said, I inspected each disc thoroughly. I found 4 or 5 with something like the paper packagaing kinda stuck to it...came off with some careful cleaning. A few with minor scuffs on them but mostly no problems.I agree the packaging could have been better but I am very glad that I bought it!I may have gotten lucky but if so...yay me.I would definitely recommend the set"
1,Packaging sucks,Just recieved my set and every disc is scratched!! The packaging is quite pathetic and useless. If you order this inspect all discs immediately.
1,Pissed,"Well Over three quarters of the discs in this 30 disc collection (The one i Purchased)Are so damaged that the discs won't play at all let alone getting an episode or two to work. And now i see that we can't get an exchange only a refund. I Should have read the ccustomer reviews before buying this Item but then again Amazon should have had this marked with a possible problem with the Item or the seller of the Item warning with all the piss poor reviews this item has recieved. No what they do is put up in red letters ""ONLY 3 LEFT IN STOCK"" How Frick√≠n Pitiful is that.????"
3,Yes and No,"I love the idea of saving shelf space by putting the 10 seasons in one box. However, the disc's are shoved between cardboard and most of them will probably have a few scratches. Eye lens cloth is very good for minimizing those scratches to help play on the player. Only main problem is if you have a disc, like me, that does not play on any player (bad disc) Amazon can not replace just that one disc. You either try to talk to MGM or send the whole set back and try your luck on the new set. Other than that, loved all the stargate seasons."
5,Good Stuff,"My package arrived in tact, no scratches on any DVDs like other posts have mentioned. I can see how it could be a problem, the cardboard sleeves don't offer much protection... but there was no problem with mine.As for the series, if you are a sci-fi fan this is a MUST HAVE. FYI: at the time of writing this review the price is $234, I got mine for $165 a couple of weeks ago- look for the deal."
4,Good collection,Just a hint: If you buy this product and import it to a european country (as Austria) you have to pay additional taxes! (e.g. for Austria 43 EUR)
2,all scratched,The disks season 6 and later are all scratched and don't play right. I'm highly disappointed in this purchase. It's been longer than 30 days since I purchased this item (and who can watch 20-some disks in 30 day?) so it can't be returned.
4,"Fantastic for Fans, but check your discs!","This is a must-own set for fans of the long-running show. Every disc has at least a pair of featurettes, usually a profile on one of the actors plus a behind-the-scenes look, or somesuch.My review would be 5/5 if not for this one critical flaw: Discs are stored in two fold-out cardboard sleeve sets. These are very attractive, but a little stiff, and a lot of people (me included) have noticed scratches on the media side of the discs. THIS HAS NOT AFFECTED PLAYBACK on the 4 or 5 discs I've gone through so far, but bear in mind there are a lot of discs and almost all show at least some scratches, so I'll be a little concerned until I've played them all."
3,Simple.. to simple,"I am super happy to have the entire series however, the packaging has been so simplify that I don't even have the info about what is on each dvd, the episodes, the extras.. so if I am not sure if I watched an episode or not I have to start watching it to find out.Also, it's a dvd, they could have put some subtitles, my hearing is not really good so I have to put the volume higher and it often wakes up the baby."
3,Stargate SG1 complete series,"I bought this for my husband who is an avid fan of Stargate SG1 for our anniversary. I gave it to him last night, and opened the box. The DVD's were all over the place, not in their slots. Some of the DVD's were scratched up pretty bad. One of the DVD's actually had a glue substance on it, that is really sticky. Hopefully the pictures of the DVD's don't reflect the shape they arrived in."
5,Wow. The whole enchilada,"Our family have loved watching Stagate together these past 10 years and were saddened when the series ended. Now with this collection the SG-1 experience will go on, and on, and on!"
4,STARGATE SG1 COMPLETE SERIES,"Fantastic series, have watches 6 seasons in three weeks. The only problem I have is the picture quality. It does not do the series justice. As for the menu system, they could have done a lot more that what they did!"
5,Your Faith is in Your Hands,This is an excellente book. It is extremely well written and gives you an easy explanation of how the lines in your hand show your real path in life. The author uses excellent samples in every single chapter. I strongly recommend everyone to read this book if they want to find a solution to the problems in their lives.
1,Lil Jon has no talent!What?! I said Lil jon has no talent! Okay!,"Lets gets something straight, Crunk is not music! Seriously lil jon needs to stop bitting off hip hop to pass off his garbage! Funny that no other genre would accept his idea but since lil jon tries to act gangsta, he gets accepted as a rapper,lol. Hip hop is all about the message,flow,nice beats,and most importantly the LYRICS!Lil jon doesn't possess ANY of these skills. Thanks to lil jon's stupidity he has created a new generation of music for retards that have an iq below the individuals shoe size.Take a nice look at soulja boy,perfect example.You can thank lil jon for inspiring that joke!P.S Don't support Lil Jon!"
5,KICK THE GAMBLING HABIT,"These two episodes are about gambling and all that implies as you enter ""The Twilight Zone."" THE FEVER written by Rod Serling demonstrates what can happen to just one of the most unlikely addictive people in the person of veteran actor Everett Sloane. Charles Beaumont's fable of gambling shows that you can kick the habit in a most unlikely way in THE PRIME MOVER with Dane Clark and Buddy Ebsen."
2,Not really the best episodes... but still very Twilight Zone,"""The Sixteen Millimiter Shrine"" (Season 1) is about the personal nostalgia of a former actress for her glory days in movies. Maybe by watching them again she could relieve those wonderful days. ""Mr. Denton on Doomsday"" (Season 1), stars Martin Landau and Doug McClure in a western-like episode. ""The Lateness of the Hour"" (Season 2) features faulty robots. ""The Trade-Ins"" (Season 3) deals with those difficult decisions in life, you know, where you and your wife are old and have to decide who's going to get a mind transplant onto a kid's body... All four stories written by series creator Rod Serling."
2,Boring,Not worth the money .. snippet I heard to entice me to buy not at all representative of the total
4,Just Another Pop-Rock Masterpiece,"If you're a fan of Enuff Znuff,you should already own this album. If you're a bit curious on where to start with their collection, this is a great one to get! Enuff's last few studio releases have been a little on the ""heavy"" side, which is fine, but I prefer songs like these on ""Peachfuzz."" This album came out in 1996 and contains songs left off of earlier albums. ""Let It Go"" and ""Kitty""(a hidden bonus track) were on a 12"" single of ""Mother's Eyes"" that was released in 1991. Try to imagine Cheap Trick with Elvis Costello on vocals. ""Rainy Day"" has a laid-back groove with an instantly singable chorus. Donnie Vie can do John Lennon almost better than Lennon and ""Make Believe"" shows that. This is a feelgood pop album with big hooks and would be a fine addition to any pop collection."
3,Peach Fuzz reverts to 1985,"Another collection of tracks that didn't make their original releases, and it's easy to see why. For the most part, these tracks don't hold up compared to what we've heard on their history of outstanding albums. That being said, though, it's not bad, just kind of... generic, seems the best term. All the tracks are listenable, just nothing spectacular. RAINY DAY & MAKE BELIEVE are my personal favorites, but this isn't a cd that I'll be playing over and over like their previous releases. But again, this is an album of leftovers, so what can one expect?"
1,Below average,"The follow-up to Tweaked , Peach Fuzz , is the worst Enuff Z'Nuff's album to date and all the songs stink just like Hanson ! Strength is a better album , so buy that !"
1,Bad thermostat,"I bought this for my girlfriend and after two months of use the on/off lever will not stay on. It is supposed to shut off automatically when the water boils, but the lever turns off right after you turn it to on. I'm not happy at all as this was an expensive tea-kettle."
5,new or used,"I bought two of this because of the price. I tested them out before I put them away. First, they looked new and no scratch or finger prints and well packed. Second, it boiled water pretty fast and turned itself off as it should. The power cord hides well at the base."
1,keep away from cuisinart,"this is a horrible kettle bec it breaks down on you in 1 mos. I have had 3 of them and they all broke down, 1 mos, 2 mos or a couple of weeks after being opened up the box. I have not used the remanufactured version, but i would suggest to keep away at all cost. I m very disappointed plus cuisinart customer service is very rude. I was very disappointed."
3,Died shortly after a year,"Starts leaking very little water after a year of use. Shortly after it refused to power on.. We took the whole thing apart and found the issue. Basically everything in the pot was okay, but the conductive base plate overheated; the tiny contact deformed and can't reach the center pin and therefore won't power on.Other than that, a great little device!"
2,"Great idea, but leaks frequently","I purchased this cup mainly because it was BPA-free. Advantages - BPA-free and keeps milk cold for several hours. Disadvantages - leaks easily if lid is not screwed on just so. Also, I have noticed if not promptly rinsed, it can get the sour milk smell (like all cups). I hand washed it during the day, and then took all the parts apart (4 in total) and put it in the dishwasher at night. I finally threw it away after leaking constantly."
2,Good at first,This was a great sippy at first but after a few throws it leaks just like all the others. Quite disappointed after spending so much. It was also such a pain to clean. Also bought the taller cup for my older child and the plastic would break off from the bottom if dropped. I am getting my kids off sippys all together now and just getting them some regular sports bottles (Kleen Kanteen)
2,Awesome . . . except for the mold,"I was so excited to find these sippy cups. They did NOT leak (you have to make sure you put everything back together properly), they were sturdy, BPA-free, and my 6 month old could easily handle them. But after about three months of use, I noticed black mold growing in the spout. My husband was able to remove it initially, but it came back and we haven't been able to remove it a second time. There are also a lot of parts, which you have to put back together properly in order to prevent leaks. If it weren't for the mold, I would give these cups five stars."
2,works great for the first week or so.. then becomes LEAKY and squeaky,"This cup was great at first. I didn't even mind the many spout parts that need to be washed, but after a few weeks it became impossible to stop it from leaking and making an annoying squeaking noise when our son used it.we still have the cups, but we threw away the tops and just use them as cups.also, they WILL dent if they are dropped.now we own several of the klean kanteens and are happy with those after several months of use. The siggs are good also, but not leak-proof since the tops are sports tops and the narrow opening makes them a bit hard to clean properly."
1,LEAKS LEAKS LEAKS!,"These leak--I've had three of them. Otherwise, they'd be my favorite cup for washability, good soft spout, good size, stainless, etc."
5,Great Cup,"I was hesitant after reading other reviews that this cups leaks, but I saw one at a local store and tried it despite negative reviews because I was anxious to get him a safer sippy ASAP. It's so great that I just bought two more. It is now my two year olds fav because it dosen't look babyish, and I love that it keeps his milk cold in the car for hours while we run errands and dosen't sweat. I really like the Sigg too, but they sweat leaving rings when my son leaves it laying around, and since it isn't insulated it is cold for his little hands, plus pull-up top is unfamiliar to him. The foogo looks familiar, and works more like his old sippy. I didn't find assembling or washing any big deal- the insulation is fantastic!!!"
3,No leaks but the spout gets moldy,Good cup until I noticed the inside of the spout and around the outside edge is moldy....can't clean it and can't seem to find a replacement. Bummer
2,Great Idea-but it leaks,"At first I loved this product, but after a few uses I have found the product is not leak proof. I'm very disappointed."
1,Don't waste your money,I purchased one of these cups and it leaked right away. The lid would not seal completely no matter how hard it was screwed on. Wrote to Thermos but got no response at all. Not worth the money at all and Thermos customer service is non-existent.
3,Slight leaking after a few uses,"These cups are not bad, but I have noticed slight dripping. We have used our Foogos about 5 times, so the quality is not what I had hoped for in a cup that cost $15. My son likes these cups and took to them quite quickly, the handles really help him to use it himself. The drip is not bad, the cup is still functional, but it is a disappointment, I thought I had found a great non-plastic cup, but I will continue searching..."
3,foogo cup not exactly leak proof,"It's great that you can put this cup in the dishwasher and not worry about the plastic wearing out. But it claims to be leak-proof which isn't exactly true. There is a small hole in the lid which is a vent I know, but milk still drips out of it. So when my toddler leaves it on the couch on its side, which he frequently does, milk is dripping out of the vent hole all over the couch! It is a good cup for insulation and cleaning but be aware of the drips before you let your toddler out of your sight!"
3,"Great concept, inferior replacement-less parts!","I REALLY like this cup. However, I have had it for less than two months and my the soft spout is splitting. My son is just over a year and TOOTHLESS so he didn't bite it apart! I am having a hard time getting any response from the company...I also bought the straw version for my older son and love it. The downside is that the valves on both styles are hard to keep clean and seem rather brittle. Again, no available replacement pieces. I haven't had any problems with leaking as others have complained about. The cup is very durable and effective in keeping beverages cold but the plastic parts seem to be inferior unfortunately..."
2,Design Flaw: Mold Can't be Washed Out,"This cup would be pretty decent if it weren't for a design flaw on the inside of the cup itself. There's a clear plastic inner rim where the metal meets the yellow plastic near the top. It's the perfect place for dirt to be trapped and for mold to grow in the cup, and believe me, it grows well there. There's no way I can see to wash the mold out from under this plastic area either. I'm just thankful it's clear and I can actually see the mold there, otherwise who knows how long I might have let my son use this cup unaware of this issue. Even run through the dishwasher, the mold remains. Save yourself money and the landfill from another useless product."
2,Not Leak Proof As Stated,"I purchased 2 of these, which by the way are not exactly the cheapest sippy cup to buy, but I wanted something that would keep my son's milk cold while we are away from the house. One worked ok, minimal leaks - nothing is leak ""proof"" and the other poored milk all over. I took it apart and reassemble it many times thinking the seal in the lid wasn't fitting right and nothing worked. The darn thing leaked milk all inside my purse while we were on vacation. So we found ourselves on a insulated sippy cup search on our vacation. Not exactly what I wanted to be doing on vacation. So I gave 2 stars because one of them worked ok and the other was completely useless."
3,holds temperature of beverage but leaks,I agree with the numerous reviews that stated that once you take apart the vavles to wash them that the cup leaks. For the price of this cup it should never leak. Great concept but product needs dramatic improvement
1,"Are you kidding me, Thermos?","Looks functional and cool but doesn't live up to its appearances. The yellow spout and the blue top are in a constant hate relationship with each other and the screw-on portion of the cup. Leaky leaky leaky! Very frustrating. A lid would've been a necessary touch for a sippy going into a diaper bag but regardless, it's a total waste of my money. It's going in the trash. I'll have to stick w/ the Munchkin or Nuby plastic BPA-free sippies."
1,Pain to clean and leaks,"Unless you put all 5 pieces of this cup together just right, it leaks. Putting it together is a chore, very difficult. The big selling point is how it keeps the drink cool, well all but the milk that sits in the spout, that gets sour quickly.Wouldn't buy them again."
5,Great Cup-and Replacements Available-Call Thermos Direct,"I have not had the leaking problems that others have had, but alignment of the lid is essential. Also, I only ever hand wash the cup and spout/valve assembly. After 12 months of use, my daughter has finally destroyed the soft spout (she's teething-has gotten her teeth late). Call thermos direct and you can get new spout and valve assemblies for $2 plus $3 shipping. Extends the life of this wonderful cup. Also, their larger cups w/the firm spout are interchangeable w/these cups if your child has started to chew the soft spout. Recommend this cup!"
2,"Keeps cold, but leaks bad!","The cup works well.. at keeping things cold. But anything past a sideways angle = a constant leak!Overly complicated valve. Too many parts to keep track of.A trick to make it leak less.. is to assemble the unit with a WET valve (water).. this helps it seal better.. but its still a PITA.Shame, if they had used a design more like the Gerber cups (1 pc valve) it would be a great idea.Its getting sent back!"
2,"Leaks, leaks, leaks","This cup leaks and the lid parts are hard to get back together after you take it apart to wash. It doesn't hold very much either. My twins like to bang it on tables, floors, etc."
2,Leaks too much,"Well I do like this cup because it's BPA Free, but aside from that it leaks very badly. I'm going to try the other BPA free cups."
1,Made in China - Thought I was trying to PROTECT my kids!,"I am spending money on expensive stainless steel bottles to keep my children safe. So, I was very disappointed to discover these are made in CHINA - a country with a terrible record of protecting its own children and now a record of disregarding the safety of ours by filling our stores with dangerous, contaminated products. I've decided to purchase another SIGG instead. It's not as great as a sippie style for smaller kids, but it's SWISS made so I have far fewer doubts about corners being cut on safety or about sweat shop children producing them."
1,These are NOT leak-proof!!,"There should be no claim to ""leak-proof"" here. I made the mistake of buying three of them. I assumed they would be great given the price, and was wanting to find something safer than plastic. Design looks great but doesn't work. My 14 month leaves them laying around and the liquid just pools around the cup. Wouldn't reco them for my 2 1/2 year old either as the spout is very thick. Spend your money elsewhere."
4,"Love it, but leaks","I really like this cup, and so does my toddler but it LEAKS. Maybe I am doing something wrong. If anyone can help please let me know. If it is left on it's side or jiggles around to much in the diaper bag, it leaks through the little air hole and the spout. Little drips that accumulate when you are not looking. The assemble isn't so tough once you do it a few times. I try to re-adjust an push the valves in tight hoping it won't leak but it always gets me everytime- or my daughter's clothes wet in the carseat especially(very annoying). Other then that- we love it and love the fact it is bpa-free. Good luck to those trying to find something not made in China. It looks like there isn't much of a choice."
2,Might not leak but it BREAKS,I'm new to the sippy cups but I've already had one that leaked. So I thought this one looked very well made. I literally had it one day when my 10 month old dropped it and broke the handle right off. We will continue our search but for now the Born Free have lasted the longest.
4,Worth the $15!,"I bought this sippy cup after reading about this cup on other sites. I wasnt intending to buy this one first but when I saw it in the store I thought okay.... I'll give it a try. I had a hug leak the first time we used it, but I fixed it and we have had nothing but happy sipping since. We travel alot on the weekends and its nice to have a cup that will keep milk cold for more than 2 hours. That alone is worth the purchase!"
2,Leaky Cup,"I love that this cup is BPA free and easy for my son to hold. I do not love how every time we use it for milk or water it leaks all over the place! We tried two different models of this cup and BOTH leak out the top - the sippy part. I have given up. We now use the the NUK Gerber BPA Free Fun Grips Spill Proof Cups. We have several of them and they work much better for us. I would not say 100% spill proof, but 95% of the time we have no issues. I would not buy a Foogo cup again."
2,Mold!,I was pretty happy with this sippy till one day I found that it was all covered with black mold from inside (the top part and a spout). I got so grossed out and threw it away right away..
2,leak proof?,"did i misplace a piece to this cup or something? it leaks ALL OVER. my 18 month old son loves turning it upside down and it literally pours out of the spout... like there's no valve in at all; and because he's 18 months and CAN pour out all that water, he does it every chance he gets. these babies are pretty pricey for a cup my son can only used while being supervised. also... the mildew is disgusting. i didn't know the spout piece came out at first and when i figured it out? ew -- it was black. my son does not drink juice and has never had milk in that cup, i guess the moisture just got caught in between the lid and the spout piece and harbored a whole lotta bacteria. i have to be very conscious to clean all the little crevices when i wash this cup. it's such a great idea, it's very nice looking and it keeps the cold water cold, but it just doesn't work."
5,YAY!! Jean Smart!! A most believable performance.,"Heartwarming, sad, happy, despair, up and down. you'll feel them all when you watch ""The Yarn Princess"""
4,Some Essential Tracks Here,"Add me to the list of those who would like more early stuff on this (and if I never hear ""Wildfire"" again it will be too soon), but I can appreciate the dilemma faced by the label -- most of Murphey's fan base probably is totally unaware of his earlier work, and either knows him for the more recent western material or his success as a Top-40 balladeer in the late 70s and early 80s. Personally, I'd pay the entire price of the album just to hear ""Alleys of Austin"" again. Yup, there's more good early stuff out there, but they made some fine choices."
1,Motion Pro sucks,DONT BUY IT!!! INSTALLED IT ON MY SHEE AND WORKED WELL TILL IT GOT MUDDY THEN THE THROTTLE GOT HARD... HAD TO TAKE IT ALL APART TO CLEAN IT... AFTER CLEANING IT AND LUBING IT AGAIN IT WORKED WELL FOR A WHILE TILL THE THROTTLE STUCK WIDE OPEN AND LAUNCHED ME INTO A TREE.AFTER MANY EMAILS BACK AND FORTH WITH CHRIS FROM MOTION PRO ABOUT MY PROBLEM I HAVE YET TO FIND A SOLUTION TO MY STICKY THROTTLE.DONT BUY IT UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO RISK AN ACCIDENT AND GET HURT
3,Weird,"If you like Toni Morrison (Beloved) or Gloria Naylor (Bailey's Cafe), you're gonna like this author's style of writing because she falls right in Morrison and Naylor's category. I personally like to read books that I can understand."
2,Not sure about this one,"This ligature is very inexpensive, but looks flashy (that's the positive). However, I find it difficult to center on my mouthpiece and clamp the reed without quite a bit of fumbling. I have another ligature that gives me no problems at all, and they look almost identical. SO I am not sure what is going on with that. Then, once I do manage to get it on correctly, when I play, I have many, many more ""squeaking"" issues than I normally have with my other ligature. I'm not sure if this is the ligature's fault, but that seems to be the only variable in my set-up. Bottom line is, I try not to use this ligature if I can help it."
5,Shades of the Deadbeats...,"Imagine 1978 punk band ""The Deadbeats"" LP played at 45 RPM so the vocals sounds like Alvin & the Chipmunks, sprinkle with a little Merzbow or the Boredoms in the cracks and you have Melt Banana's ""Charlie."""
5,wahchachichioifheafohea This is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,No-one wreaks havoc on my ears like these fine Japanese folk. If you like dischordiant noise this is for you. If you don't avoid this at all costs!
1,The author needs to bone up on behavior modification,"This book is one of the most dangerous books out there. It simplifies the motivation and mechanisms of aggression and buys into the anthropomorphic view that aggressive dogs are 'bad' and just need to know who's 'boss'. The author needs to learn about learning principles and stop fooling the public into thinking he knows of which he speaks. He is related to Carol Lea Benjamin through marriage. It is obvious from his book that he is a rank novice when it comes to aggression. It is amazing that with all the brilliant minds out there, Dunbar, Donaldson, Pryor, Rogersen, etc, etc, that Stephen Joubert could think he could write a book on aggression that would not be scrutinized."
1,One of the more dangerous books out there,"As a professional trainer and behavioral counseler (graduated from San Francisco Dog Training Academy's Counseling Certificate course with honors), I find the information in this book inaccurate and appalling. The author has a garbled understanding of true behavior modification techniques and actively advocates a method that is recognized in my profession as likely to exacerbate the problem (referring to his recommendation to 'flood' the fearfully aggressive dog). His belief that simple obedience (taught in a forceful, confrontative manner) can 'fix' an emotional state such as aggression is simplistic at best. A professional who understands animal learning laws and behavior modification techniques whould immediately recognize that this book is one for the burn pile. This book earned one star only because I wasn't given a 'no star' option."
1,Caution - Inappropriate Advice in this book,As a professional dog trainer that specializes in behavior (approximately 85-90 % of my business is dealing with aggression of all sorts) I have to advise that people skip this book. I can foresee people using this book and getting hurt by their dogs and/or making their dog's aggression problems worse.
3,Something I have been looking for in music,"I have been searching for something different in music and I think I have found it. This album blends Jazz, funk and noise all in one. With a hint of lyrics from a oriental women. I think of Japanese big band when I hear some of the songs. If you seek something a little more avant-garde then check out any of Ex Girls albums."
1,"Not wtat I thought it would be, I am sorry I got it.. I wish I could take it back!","Ok lets face it I am a 54 year old dyslexic, so I spell like crap! I can live with that. I find ways around my little problem. On Kindle this book is just a fancy list of words that I have to page through to get to a word! ( This will be an Archived Item ) All I wanted to do was type a word in and get the right spelling. Not dig through a long list of A to Z words to get to my word. You have to start at A to get to Y... Save your money and get a hand held word speller ( most under 25 bucks). You will be much happier. I already have a Franklin spelling ace that works great for me. I just wanted something for my kindle cause I take it where erve I go. I thought I could kill 2 birds with one stone. NO LUCK THERE!!! It just cost me $10.00 Go to a good office outlet store and get a hand held speller ( save the shipping) you will love it.... I hope this helps..."
2,No improvement on the sorry American version.,"This is the same set as the disappointing American Warner Archives CD I have also reviewed. Three of bonus tracks -- ""The Drifter,"" Harper's self-penned ""There's No Time Like Today"" and Burt Bacharach and Hal David's ""Me, Japanese Boy"" -- are lesser tunes from their third and fourth albums. Amazon lists an additional bonus track as ""Small Talk,"" a cut I never heard of. Could it be a misprint for the band's pleasant if syrupy version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Happy Talk"" on Harper's debut album? There was a chance to improve a bit on the original version and it wasn't taken. At twice the price, this CD has less to offer than the American release."
4,Good -- but is it worth it?,"I have to respectfully disagree with the gentleman below. I've never heard ""No Time Like Today,"" but ""The Drifter"" and ""Me Japanese Boy"" are both excellent -- my favorites from ""The Secret Life of Harper's Bizarre."" ""Small Talk"" is a version of a good song also done by Claudine Longet. So I can tell you that the three bonus songs I've heard are all very good -- and the overall CD is excellent. Harper's Bizarre was a fantastic band. It's just up to you whether you want to spend all the extra money for four songs. Keep in mind, though, that it's very hard to find the original albums on CD -- I have only found two of them, after a lot of looking -- so if you really want this stuff you may have no other choice."
4,Family relations,This book was excellent for an individual who love pictures. The writing was easy to read.Any child would enjoy this book.
4,"I Remember the home at ""121""","I Remember ""121"" is an excellent book for Pre-School and elementary age students. It has colorful graphics to hold the attention of the readers. It teaches about family and the consequences you face if you misbehave. I would recommend this book to all elementary teachers or parents."
4,"I Remember ""121""","I liked this book and its beautiful illustrations, because of the connections that I felt with the central character, even though I came from a white, working class neighborhood. I liked to read about a black middle class family. The memories were somewhat disjointed."
1,NO channels,"Just received this TV yesterday after having an Accurian 7"" portable TV by Radio Shack (had to give back to mom)- bought the Coby because could no longer get the Accurian - which was amazing!. Went through channel set up and not a single channel. So disappointed! I know it is not my area since I have other TVs that pick up channels no problem and am in the middle of Atlanta in the city with no obstructions to my home. VERY disappointed."
3,Reception difficulties.,Great picture for the 1 channel we get. Cannot get the 10 or so channels the antenna website identifies as possible. Disappointed with the limited access.
2,Couldn't get any channels,We live too far from a tower and therefore couldn't get any channels.It's going back. Too bad; it's a cute little TV.
4,"Great Album, Beautiful Singer, Beautiful Songs","El Cd No es Malo, Es Un Buen CD El Track Mas bello Es Mi Destino eres Tu Es Un material de excelente calidad, Ami Gusto Solo Hay Dos canciones que me parecen super aburridas y malas que son Dejar de Querer y Bailar Que Asco nunca habia escuchado una porqueria asi. Pero Bueno el resto del CD es Muy Bueno."
4,alan parsons project - live DVD,Concert is very raw and not over produced as some others are.Disappointed the audio quality isnt 5.1 or DTS.The band has a huge songlist to draw from and mostly they have selected some good choices for this DVD.Am sure all fans would be happy just to own this.
4,Alan Parsons,"This is a great DVD with great sound, camera work and song selection.The only disappointment I had (which cost this DVD a star) was the sound levels (or lack of)it was either recorded at or mixed at.When this DVD is at max volume, it's not very loud.If you live in an apartment with neighbors all around, that might not be an issue but I live in the country and like to crank my performances.Great DVD."
4,Alan's 2nd Live DVD,"This is Alan's 2nd live DVD that I know of. For all the fans out there the only place you can get it is thru Alan Parsons official web site. DVD is called ""live in Madrid"" 2005. Strange that this DVD is recorded in Madrid also. You Tube has some great live video of Alan Parson's Project from 1990 at the ""World Liberty Concert"" The DVD I haven't been able to find yet."
2,Where's the Bass?,"I have loved Alan Parsons since the 1970's and to finally see a concert by them was an incredible opportunity. The music set was a really good pick. The video was crude, but hey it's their precise audio that makes Alan Parsons sound quality stand out of the crowd, right? Well not on this DVD. It sounds like your woofers blew out and all you have left are your midrange and tweeter speakers. If you're using your TV speakers then you may not notice but I was waiting in vein for my two 15"" and two 12"" woofers to come to life and it never happened. This DVD is going right back into the used DVD for sale pile. Let's hope that when they mix the blu-ray version that they include the full dynamic range in the audio track."
3,Should be in 5.1 surround and longer show.,"Finally a concert dvd. I just wish it had been in 5.1 surround sound and a longer concert. I would like to have given this dvd 5 stars since Alan is one of my favorite artists, but I was disappointed in the length of the dvd and as I said, it should have been in surround sound. Otherwise the music is great as usual."
2,Something big is missing here.,"Eric Woolfson. He is half of the Alan Parsons Project- probably even greater than half. His voice is the lead on songs like Eye in the Sky, Time and Don't Answer Me. He recently passed away but in 2004 he was still very much alive. Alan Parson's voice is nowhere near as great and neither is this punk singing lead, prancing around the stage with his black fingernail polish. The band and the backing vocals are tight, but not having Eric Woolfson in this is a huge disappointment."
5,Nostalgia to the Future,"Three weeks ago I purchased a new Miata, after being away from sports cars for 25 years. (TR3+BMW 2000ti) Oh how I wish I had gotten back into it sooner. It has been so much fun. I purchased the book last week, finished it and loved it. The book told the story of the early British influence, Triumphs, Healeys, etc, on the design, development and marketing of the Miata, brought it thru 1999. The struggles, hopes, fears of the individuals in the company, and the process of internal competition to ferret out the best car with a very high emphasis on handling and suspension. Wow, and the discussion about lack of Miata restoration projects, why, because the oldest ones don't need to be restored, they are still in great condition. And to think, I almost purchased an MR2, now, Maita's forever. The book gave me great background and justification for my exuberance."
4,STEVE JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER,"This CD is a great example of an artist who continues to excel when you think he has reached his peak. Steve's voice seems to mellow with each album. I was first drawn to this album because of two songs that were co written by Steve and some friends of mine. ""Cornstalk Pony"" and ""Windows of Heaven"". But I would have purchased it for the song ""Railroad Written All Over Him"" anyway. The CD is full of strong lyrics interwoven with intricate melodies. I listen to it over and over again and never get tired of it."
3,Just buy the CDs,"Groove Collective was the best band of the 90's. Making a ""Best of"" that doesn't contain tracks from all of their albums is a waste of time. If you came to the band from this CD, good choice. This material is taken from Shanachie releases of 1998-2001. What might be considered classic Groove Collective of 1990-1996 is not represented here.I highly recommend getting all of their CDs to really explore the ground that this band has covered. Even the latest live recordings that they sell on their website are good (they still bring it live, although 'it' is quite different from their original line-up). I understand where the desire to make this type of album comes from, but reward yourself and purchase all of the CDs from this unbelievably talented group. I can think of no recent band that continues to sound so fresh over a decade later."
2,This CD is o.k.,"I am amazed that the U.T.'s would even consider releasing this cd. It is really bland... There are some great tracks on this disk, however the vocals sound terrible. People out there save your money and buy A Decade of Dance, their live comp. It sounds much better, besides, the Untouchables sound great live. A studio recording does not quite capture the prescence that these gentlemen have on stage. Unless of course, they record in a great studio with incredible engineers."
5,passion...,"To put it simply, I loved this album. My friend Sarah was the one who first introduced me to the music of this amazing artist. She took me to a one of her concerts in Boston, along with two of my close friends, and at this concert I experienced and saw a kind of passion that I had never seen from an adult artist before. I am a music lover, but first and foremost I am a dancer and what I listen for most of all when I listen to music is the inspiration to move and to make the body at one with the music. Ferrick did that for me and her album is now in the CD player all the time because her music has a solid, powerful, rhythm as well as lyrics that inspire which combine to make for excellent music for dancing. Her passion will make you laugh, cry, scream and dance."
4,Phenomenal vocals and guitar,"Melissa Ferrick's lyrics are strong and evocative. She is a lesser known female artist who is on the verge of greater things. This live album offers fresh sounds for those listeners who are worn out from over-played radio singles. The CD hasn't been back in its case since I bought it. She will make you laugh, cry, and dance; all the while loving her more and more."
5,Melissa will amaze you!,"Melissa Ferrick is one of the best singer songwriters I've ever seen or listened to. Her live performance is moving and heart felt. Buy this CD and you won't be diappointed and better yet, go see her live."
1,topcell 14.4 porter cable replacement battery,"Ordered two topcell 14.4 batteries when original PC batteries quit after five years. When they arrived I put them on charge. The ""defective"" light on charger flashed the whole cycle during charge. When charged, one drove 17 1 1/4"" drywall screws and quit. Second one drove a 3/4 spade bit about 3/16"" into a pine board and quit. Sent them back and got two more with same identical results as the first two. Borrowed a 14.4 PC battery and put it on charge, it charged up normally proving that there is nothing wrong with charger. These topcell batteries are junk and not worth carrying home."
2,Lasted less than two years,I bought a pair and they worked great initially but slowly just faded away after 1.5 years. One is totally dead and will not take a charge an the other will take a charge but then falls flat within a day w/no usage or within an hour of light use. The originals lasted just under three years of nearly daily use. If I could do it over again I wouldn't have bought them.
1,had to send them back,These batteries wouldn't take a charge. I had to send them back (I bought 2). Maybe a just got a couple of lemons.
5,professional,"just recieved the battery a few weeks ago, Using it everyday on the job. Its holding the charge as good as the brand name at alot less money. Would at this time recommend Topcell Products."
3,informative but extremely dry,"Full of information if you can manage to plod through the author's dreary prose (though I imagine about 25% of the blame for this should be laid on the translator). Baudin makes some rather bold (though not without merit) generalizations about the peoples of the Andes that, while probably aceptable in 1961 France, today smack of eugenics and will likely startle a 21st century American reader. Thoroughly researched and exhaustively footnoted, this book with certainly fit the bill for someone looking to understand the structure of inca society. But don't expect to have fun along the way. Probably not the best book on the subject, but the best I could find in Peru during my stay."
4,Pretty nifty,"I like that there is a full song and there's a karaoke song.Some of the timing is a bit off, a difference between the two, but the selection is good and the singers do well. I was going to use the karaoke to learn how to sing ""The Rose"" to my wife at our wedding ceremony."
2,Awful DVD - VHS Burned to DVD Junk...,The quality of this DVD is awful. You would get better quality from an old VHS tape laying around somewhere.
2,"Older movie, Trying to be touching","I'm a Tawny Kitaen fan but the movie, dancing and mucic is 80ish and not good. The acting is pretty horrible. The plot is alright but the movie tries to be touching and falls a little short because of the acting. If you like Tawny though, she is nice to look at. But that is the all you have from her as well."
4,still operating,"operation ive keeps operating with this album, Jesse Michaels shows his best and keeps singin about unity and more good stuff......extremely good punkish ska' influenced album........gotta buy it and stop wasting your time suckas"
4,Interesting and compelling series for young viewers.,"I am 10 years old, but I think my review will be relevant because lots of parents will buy this for their kids to learn about the evolution of humans. I liked the level of detail and the reconstructions - it felt like going back in a time machine, and I found myself wanting to watch the series repeatedly. I liked that it had lots of new findings about early human ancestors like Homo heidelbergensis(Goliath)and Homo floresiensis (The Hobbit)."
5,A Christmas delight!!,Excellent recording of this lovely gem of an opera! All the soloists are wonderful! I wish there was a DVD of this cast - I would buy it in a heartbeat!!
1,Very disappointing,"I'm currently studying the role of Amahl's mother, and I got this recording by the luck of the draw. Kaspar is horribly flat throughout, which is a shame. It was a difficult recording to listen to once, I dread bearing it the number of times I will need to over the next two months.I'm going to try to return it this afternoon."
2,Amahl,Gee - sorry to those who like this modern recording but I like the 1951 recording the best.I have both the LP which is quite scratched by now and the CD which is quite good except for the pauses between tracks. I recommend the 1951 version available from Amazon (or at least it was in 2001).
5,Amazing History,The confederacy's navy during the civil war is a very impressive display of piracy on the high sees. While most of the attention always focuses on the iron ships it is often forgotten that there were several others out there raiding the north's commerce. This book puts quantifiable numbers and daring high sees escapades onto the same page. It is a very fast read and one that gives a new perspective on the civil war. The South's daring strikes and the north's eventual efforts to hunt down and put a stop to these raiders are cataloged here and make for interesting reading. There is also a very interesting subset that looks at European policies towards the United States during this time period and a perspective that is not often gathered can be seen here. This is a must have for true civil war buffs.
2,Nitro Video boaring,This video was boaring. These girls are not the best looking bunch. And the two good looking girls wore the least revealing swimsuits. If you need something to put you to sleep buy this video.
1,I search history,I am a studend in an open university in greece and i need to read this book to write my woork about nazism in the second world war. i haven t read this book. i want to buy it but your iformations does not help to buy it. i have more than one hour trying to find how i will buy it!
4,Wow.,"Wow, just wow. I read the book in 2 days. It was a page turner. The story wove fantasy and reality together in a strange way - or was it all fantasy, or was it all reality? Things that make you go Hmmm......I especially like the different types of fools discussed in the book. The fools, and the reasons why these characters were fools, is something that isn't often talked about in our community. When it is, it's usually discussed in a holier-than-thou OR you-ain't-better-than-me/us manner. In my opinion, it was discussed in a way that each fool was seen as equally negative.Hopefully what I just said makes some sense. Great book. My only complaints were that it wasn't long enough (I wanted more more more!) and that I didn't fully understand the ending (was it meant to be understood, though?). I've already recommended it to one person and will be recommending it to many others."
5,Karma Incarnate,"I was both appalled and enthralled reading this literary piece. Excellent, to say the least. It takes the reader to a place of self examination, sometimes an ugly journey to sojourn! I felt myself relating to Joseph, then despising his arrogance and judmental behavior. Bryan Gibson is a brilliant author, I am looking forward to reading more from him."
5,LST Magnum Jr,"Perfectly sized gutting knife for field carry. Great steel, non-slip handle, comfortable ergonomic design. Easy to sharpen; holds edge well. Price is very affordable. Great piece of gear!"
1,not work the cost of shipping,very hard to get on the ipod. all dust in your car will stick to this rubbery ipod cover. the plastic window that protects your ipod window sticks to the ipod making it impossible to read yoru ipods text. boo!
1,Heavy on Metal and not on Funk,"This CD was not worth all the money I paid for it. Hampton could have left ""Funkasson"" out of the title. I was expecting to hear something that sounded at least as good as Axiom Funk or Some of Eddie's material. I felt like I was robbed. I also lightened my comments in respect of Amazon's review guidelines."
1,Comfortable but sub-standard materials for the sole,A comfortable sandal no doubt - but don't wear it outdoors! The sole is thinnest at the heel so of course wears out well before the rest of the sole. Well saying it is a sole would be generous. If all you do is wear it on marble floors then you'll be fine. But if you wear it outdoors plan on spending $40-$50 to get the sole replaced often (4 months). The whole bottom of course! It should really be advertised as an indoor sandal. A shame because it is comfortable - and don't bother calling/writing customer service ....
4,Sean's Birk's,I bought these for my boyfriend. He loves the sandals and the pricing couldn't be beat! They were shipped ahead of the scheduled time that was given to us at ordering.
4,Very good read,"And to be honest, I didn't expect it to be. Don't let the cheesy cover fool you. This book was extremely well written. And it's long enough so that you can really get into it. It's set both in Ireland and France and follows the lives of two teenagers into adulthood. I don't want to give too much away, but do try this. Fascinating, a book I could not put down. Bravo!"
1,Looks neat but no scent at all.,This item looks neat but had absolutely no scent upon arrival. Making it pointless for what it is supposed to be.
3,Before you purchace these.......,"These are plastic, not ""rosewood"" as I was expecting. Two seconds after hanging one of my frames on the wall, it fell off and the plastic frame broke. Not the glass though so I guess that's good :)I'm not going to be returning these, but had I known that they were plastic and not wood, I would not have purchaced these."
1,Cheap Plastic Frames,I received my frames which were to be used as gifts to family and were to hold a memorial photo and poem dedicated to my mother who passed away last month. Not only was this the worst money I ever spent but with all the added financial stress I couldn't afford to waste a dime on something so cheap and breakable as this. The backs crack and do not stay together. DON'T BUY THESE FRAMES is all I'll say.
2,Spin Spin,"The ring I received wasn't as symmetrical or thick as the one shown on the site. The inner waves are somewhat misaligned where the metal is joined causing it not to spin very well and some force has to be used. After long periods of wear, especially in hot or humid weather, it can leave some staining on your finger. But for the cost that I paid, I really can't expect too much. It is just the image online and the actual product I received have distinctive differences."
5,In my pants...,"The third season builds on every ongoing joke of the series until it's a never ending stream of laghter. The mystery of Phil Ken Sedden, that thing I sent ya, Birdgirl, and of course, Jessie Jackson. If your a fan it's for you, but I'd recomend seeing the first two seasons before, just where you can put all the it all together."
4,"Volume 3, Triple Entendre! HA!","Harvey Birdman is not a super hero any more. Now he is an Attorney, showing us the dark seedy belly of the Hanna-Barbara cartoon universe. So trully classic episodes are available in this last set."
2,"The show gets 5 stars, the dvd gets 2","The episodes on this dvd are hilarious, save for the couple of episodes after Sebben bought the farm, but the dvd is a major ripoff. The special features are an absolute joke. No commentaries is a big letdown. I had these episodes on my computer, so buying the dvd was pointless. Oh well. Whatever. If you don't already own the episodes, the Incredible Hippo episode is worth the price of admission alone. LAFF RIOT."
5,This show should have gone farther!,I think this show was cancelled way before it needed to be. One of the best shows ever to premiere on Adult Swim. This was the last season they had and the last I had to buy. I highly recommend this DVD!
4,Cold Air Intake,I installed this in my 2001 Ford Ranger 2.3L install went bad the clamps didn't fit and the vapor pipe that goes from the valve cover to the intake didn't come in the package. Feels alot better than the stock one I found it cleaper here than anywhere else and feels awesome. Feels very very strong A+ in performance
3,Modifications required,"I like cold air intakes. I've put them on all my vehicles and I've always used K&N.; I decided to go with the more economical Volant 29423 for my 2002 Ford Ranger with a 2.3 L, 4-cyl engine. The quality of the parts and filter was good, but I had to struggle to make it work. First, one of the screw clamps simply wasn't long enough to clamp one of the hoses. I had a longer one on hand so it didn't slow down the install. The other screw clamps were barely long enough. Second, the bracket from the radiator support to the air flow sensor was completely wrong. I had to cut it, bend it, and drill a new mounting hole to make it work. Finally, they did not include a hose to connect the crank case ventilation tube. Luckily I had some tubing on hand to complete the install.So, I like the intake, but unless you have a shop and some spare parts lying around, you are going to have difficulties installing the Volant on your Ranger."
5,A historical novel of South Louisana . . .,"Where do you begin to review a book such as Linda G. Corley's, ""Buried Treasures: The Age Of Manifest Destiny?"" Perhaps the Spanish Invasion? That is how far back this well-written, well-documented historical novel goes to begin the story of the infancy of the state of Louisiana, and eventually introduction to the infamous pirate Jean Laffite who comes as brigand and eventually becomes, if not a first-class citizen, a respected one.Linda Corley has performed a marriage of history and fiction in order to write her spell-binding story of the many aspects of the events leading up to, and after, the Louisiana Purchase. This magnificently-illustrated historical novel cover just about every aspect of early southern living, Louisiana in particular, and even gives homage to the mysterious voodoo legends. Great read."
5,Great book,"Greetings all, This is a small, out of print gem for those oddballs (like me) who find foreign cultures interesting and uplifting. This has a lot of historical detail, maybe too much, but it is about the source of some of our present culture, and shared culture with our """"cousins. Not a book for modern kids. This is more for adults who have an interest in foreign culture or who have travelled in GB. For a limited audience, it is first rate stuff. Best regards."
3,This maze made me dizzy,"A few chapters were amusing, to say the least but in general this wasn't the raunchiest book in the world.The writing was decent, which made it an easy read and the general idea of ""opening my own doors"" was somewhat fun and reminiscent of the ""choose the page"" books for children and teenagers.I would recommend this book as a general read when you're looking for something not too serious, not too deep and not too complicated. I would not recommend it to those looking for either a love story or full blown erotica as this book falls weakly in the middle."
4,Great for sharing with someone.,"My husband & I had 3 hours before our connecting flight left for our honeymoon. While checking the racks at the airport bookstore, I came across this very unique book. Hours have never passed so slowly, as we each took turns ""opening doors"" and discovering what turned the other on. Yes, so many parts of the book are cliche and just plain silly, but for us, it made it easier to read, laugh at and enjoy sharing with each other."
4,Choose your own (erotic) adventure,"Alina Reyes has won the reputation of being a literary voice in erotic fiction. Her books are poetic and provocative at the same time. Having read The Butcher, I know that Reyes writes her sensuous stories with a touch of magical realism. She has done the same thing with Behind Closed Doors.This book is broken into two sections. It is shown from the female and male perspective. You enter the Kingdom of Eros -- a labyrinth of erotic adventures that you experience by choosing which door to enter. There is no real plot in this novel, except that there are lots of quirky symbolism in the chapters -- or rather, doors. I particularly enjoyed ""The Man at the Window."" I love its symbolic message.This is a great and entertaining book. You should not, however, take this book seriously. Despite the symbolism, Behind Closed Doors is meant to be a fun and sensuous read. Enjoy!"
5,Month by Month Phonics,"The item arrived in good condition, it is a very useful book for our first grade classroom. Thank you for offering this book at a good price."
2,Not worth the Money,"My experience has not been good using this product. My internet connection (cable) actually ran slower after I adjusted the settings with System Mechanic 3. Some of the graphics on the websites also began to not load.The File Removal feature only found 8 mg. of temporary files to delete, out of a total of 6 gigs.... not much of an improvement. The Registry adjustment was equally disappointing, as my computer did not run faster after SM3 adjustments. Only because SM3 did find 8 mg. of files to delete, I gave it a rating of 2 stars.The program didn't do any harm to my system, but it did not live up to the praise other reviewers gave it."
5,"Valuable, Powerful Utility","System Mechanic takes care of a number of Windows problems, both large and small. The file cleanup function alone is worth the price. Gets rid of all sorts of Windows trash files at the click of a button. The startup manager will let you adjust what comes up when you start windows quickly and easily. Read the help files and check for updates frequently."
1,avoid like the plague!,"I have Windows ME and using this product has caused constant problems on my system. Functions you take for granted on your computer wil start to disappear! I only bought it because Amazon was practically giving it away with a rebate, now I see why. This mechanic is bad news!"
1,Not worth the money! Software can cause some problems.,I purchased this product and used it for some time. I then used the Registry tool and the next day I found out that my windows xp operating system was messed up. Microsoft Picture and Fax Viewer got messed up and my computer was missing some files. I do not recomment this product. Use Norton Systemworks instead.
3,Not Wolzein's best effort,"Susan and Jed Henshaw are spending their anniversary by throwing a big party at the inn where they spent their honeymoon. All is well until they discover the dead body of one of their guests under a pile of presents on their bed. Thus begins Susan's latest efforts at solving a murder mystery. This book did not hold my interest as some of the others in the series have because there were so few suspects and not enough interesting red herrings. Susan, her friend Kathleen, and her husband Jed seem to hash and rehash the same scenarios over and over before the murderer is revealed. As in some of the earliest books in the series, the solution is pretty far-fetched and didn't provide a satisfying climax to the book. This series has its ups and downs and this is one of the less sterling additions to the Susan Henshaw Mysteries."
5,Great Read!,I really enjoyed this book. I have been reading the Susan Henshaw books since the beginning and have always found them entertaining as well as believable. The characters are well-rounded and easy to understand and I like that Valerie Wolzien has used upper-class characters instead of hard-boiled characters as are frequently used. I feel that Susan might be me or one of my friends and I like that. I highly recommend this cozy series.
3,It was Okay,"I have always enjoyed the Susan Henshaw mysteries, but I was alittle disappointed in this one. For one thing her friend, Kathleen, has two children, and somehow the daughter's named changed from Alice, in the last two books, to Emily in this book. It just didn't keep me entertained. I kept wanting to get to the end, so I skipped over quite a few pages. I hope that the next book will be better."
1,now quite what I expected,The earrings look like enamel and are very small. Not a good value for the money I paid. I was expecting larger petals and it was supposed to look like a real leaf from a rose. It does not look like a rose petal at all. Very disappointed.
1,Doesn't take a licking and keep on ticking...,"I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present. She's a medical student and wanted an accurate watch with a second hand...and a cute red band. Big mistake. The numeral ""2"" came off and rode around on the second hand in the first month. I had it repaired and was told that several of the numerals were hanging on by a thread. Now repaired, it doesn't keep time...an essential duty of a watch, to my way of thinking. It's not even four months old and it's ready for the garbage. Don't waste your money."
1,Not the original artists,"Don't get this if you are looking for the original artists. It's electronic and very annoying. A lot a yee haw - literally. As a DJ, I was looking for a CD that had all the songs I needed. This isn't it."
1,disappointed,I am very disappointed w/ this cd because I was under the impression the songs were by original artists. In the description on Amazon it says 'various artists' which in my past experience has meant original artists. This cd reminds me more of a kareoke cd in that these 'various artists' are less than average musicians.
1,Do not buy,"Do not buy this CD!! Had there been a review available I would not have purchased it either. The music resembles old C=64 midi, and is off tempo and what few vocals there are are off key. I was aware that it was not original artists, but there was no attempt to cover the originals, or improve upon a good thing. Just poor quality."
1,JUNK!!!,"I just listened to the samples, and I can tell, this is JUNK! Bad singing, bad musicians, bad mixes, bad everything. Amazon should remove this."
1,Unusable CD,I wish I would of read and trusted the other reviews of this cd before ordering. I could make a compilation CD with an old casio keyboard and have the tracks sound better and more like the originals than this CD label did. Not much to worry about with copyright laws on this CD
2,Bulky and uncomfortable,"Previously, Amazon displayed a different stock photo. As of Feb, 2013, the photo matches the product I received, and returned. My previous review was:The model number may be the same, but the headphones in no way match the photo! The ones in the photo look sleek, with a slender ear clip. The ones you get are bulbous and clunky, and have a thick round, uncomfortable ear clip."
3,Low Volume,"In case anyone is wondering because of the small picture, these are clip-ons. The design is okay, but the volume is just so low it's hard to listen if there's noise around you. Okay for the price."
3,Head Phones with a short cord,"I usually like the Ear Clip headphones, but there are a few reasons I would not buy these ones again. The cord is very short, so I had to get an extension to be able to use it with my computer. Where the cord attaches to the ear piece is on the end of the clip that goes behind the ear and thus pushes out on the ear creating discomfort. When using these headphones, I had to turn the volume way up on my computer compared to other headphones I have used. When the music was at a good level, then all the computer alert sounds were excessively loud."
2,Disappointing,"I expected better from Maxell.These Earphones broke in less than one month.Most headphones break down after 4-5 months because I use them every day to listen to Audiobooks. Even cheaper no-name headphones I have had lasted longer than these which are supposed to be from a big name headphone manufacturer.Even when they worked, they would constanly fall off of my ears, which was very irritating.I have now repalced these with Maxell neck phones. These work much better, though they don't carry a loud enough volume and have no volume control. They are also thinner than the ear phones were so they are more comfortable when laying down and wearing them.So I am not against Maxell, just this particular design of headphones. So if you want smaller phones, go for their neckphones instead of their earphones. The price is about the same but the quality is much better."
2,eww - No bass what so ever,"Trying to replace my panasonic HS-48 headphones. These aren't in the ball park sound-wise at all. I can't imagine anyone actually liking these. No bass, almost no midrange, blaring treble. They sound like tweeters."
2,Just OK,"I bought these at Walmart for about $6 and boy do you get what you pay for. After one of my Phillips clip on headphones lost sound in one of the them, I replaced them with these after I saw Walmart didnt have them anymore. In comparision, these are a big disappontment. These are bulky, and uncomfortable, plus the cord is constantly getting tangled. With Phillips the cord was attached to the bottom of the headphones, whereas these are attached to the part that surrounds your ears which was always getting caught up in my earrings. I will say that the sound quality is pretty good, but after 1 month, one of the headphones, keeps going in and out. So needless to say I am in the market for some new headphones."
1,"Good news, bad news",good news ..very comfortable on earsbad news..not loud enough.maybe spend a little more and get higher quality headphones
2,Break routinely,"They last about 6 weeks before the wires at the input jack get bent out of shape and only the left ear plays. I've owned two pairs of these that have both failed in the same way. Play fine during that time, but don't seem to even be worth the $5."
2,Better buy several- you'll need them,"These little earphones have nice sound and are comfortable to wear, but they last one year at the most. If you buy them for their good price, go ahead and buy the replacements now."
1,Do Not Buy,I would not recommend buying these. The right earpiece totally fell apart after only one month of having these which left me with only the left earpiece and the right earpiece dangling broken from the cord.
2,Low budget,You get what you pay for. Just spend a few dollars more and get headphones that have some sound quality. These are pretty bad.
1,Sorely disappointed,"I can't use earbuds, so I'm always on the hunt for the next great pair of clip-on headphones.This wasn't it.the left ear crackles if I turn the volume up enough to drown out subway noises."
1,Did not work out of the package.,These are cheap headphones. Nice design but cheap. The connection on the input plug was poor and cut out periodically. All in all you get what you pay for.
2,not worth it,"No bass and very little midrange, specifications are misleading with 20-22,000Hz. If someone just wanted to hear sound these are okay to use but the cord is so thin it will likely break in a month anyway. Better to just spend an extra 10bucks and get a decent pair of headphones."
5,Great price,My husband works on our cars and saves a lot of money. This was an excellent price and the car runs great!
2,Questionable quality,"This manifold was cheap, and does work, but not without issues. Some of the holes for the brackets and coil paks which had brass inserts on the oem manifold are just holes in the plastic which you will now just use the supplied self tapping screws. And one of those bosses broke off while I was attaching the coil. Also, one of the intake sealing o rings had no wall left around the port in one area. I just hope it doesn't get sucked in. This is one of the problems of mail order. At a parts counter, I would have rejected that manifold and tried to pick out one with the full wall securing the o ring."
5,dorman intake,"The manifold was received in good condition , and was as advertised. It installed easily and works great. I would recommend it to anyone and the price is about $100 less than a local parts store."
4,"Good price, good product, be careful","WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNINGBe very careful when using the self taping screws going straight into plastic, in my experience, either the screws broke off, or the it split the plastic, almost tearing a hole in the manifold. So..be careful, in particular when screwing in ignition coils(if you have Coil on Plug) or with the bracket behind the throttle body that holds the accelerator wire.Other than that, seems to be working well. I'm not good with cars at all so it took me 12 hours to do the whole job(Having to go to the store a couple times for spark plugs/coolant/tools). But really, an absolute novice other wise, and again seems to be working well. if you are a noob like me I found it helped to use 2 or 3 guides since there can be some big differences between years/builds. crownvic.net is your friend.Anyway, good product, but be careful with self taping screws."
3,(Rotating?) Component Rack,"I recently purchased this AV Rack. While it does look very sleek the craftsmanship of the ready to assemble parts leaves much to be desired. In the back of this unit there is a c channel to attempt some cable management and it is made of three peices of wood, one of which had the holes drilled in the wrong place. The shelves are nice but if you have a moderately heavy receiver you will want to put it on the bottom wooden shelf. All this said I was a little disappointed when I got my ""Rotating"" rack assembled, it was on caster wheels. I was thinking that it was going to be a really slick turntable in the bottom to make accessing the components easy. This was a letdown but it still moves rather freely even on a high pile carpet. Shop around and look at this one before you buy."
5,All you want for making candle by yourself,"I like ideas in this book a lot. It inspire me and make me want to make candle. Especially in the Moulded Candels that show me the idea that easy to apply, also, this book has beautiful gallery at the back.I recommend this book as your first book to start your project."
5,Best quick solution for cleaning chrome wheels,"These are awesome! I use about 2 sheets to do all four chrome wheels, along with a microfiber to dry then give it the final polish. Dirty average wheels to blinging/blinding chrome in less than 5 minutes. This is the best chrome quick cleaning solution on the market!"
1,Author of Midnight Magic Belly Dance Music,"I just wonder, How could you use a title that have been published by another co like ""Sphinx Records"" which has the same album Midnight Magic Music for Belly Dancing By author Dr. Samy Farag.This is not anegative review; it is simply a question to the author of the music and the publishing co. Is there away to clear the name of your album before you release it.Thanks"
2,MGM Holiday Classic Collection ( The Bishops Wife / March of The Wooden Soldiers / Pocket full of Miracles ),"I have seen The Bishops Wife colorized version on t.v.. When I saw this It said in color. I was really excited to get this product. But when it arrived there was only one movie in color the other two were not ,including The Bishops Wife .That was very disappointing & misleading.It really matters to some people if its b&w , Colorized , Or just color .I think you need to be very clear when your selling a product."
4,dvd,the description said this was in color---The Bishop's Wife is blk and wht---I was disappointed but i will keep it.
5,Order service,"I actually did not keep this product. I ordered it as a Christmas gift and then discovered someone else had also gotten it for the same person. So, I sent mine back and ordered something else. The service was excellent, very prompt, no questions asked, very pleasant. I would definitely do busy with this seller again."
4,3 in 1 Christmas cheer,I was pleasantly surprised by the colorization of these movies which make them somewhat updated for our grandkids enjoyment. Each film is definitely a tradition for the Christmas Season.All of these are such classics. We loved them all and will keep them around for many Christmases to come!
2,Mom said she only liked 1 out of 3 movies,"I was trying to find The Bishop's Wife DVD as a Christmas present for my mom. I found this set for about the same price as I was finding the individual movie for, so I decided to get this set. I'm not too big of a fan of these movies, but according to my mother, the only movie she liked out of this set was The Bishop's Wife, but that's purely her opinion. Received the product fine and quality was fine."
3,Holiday classics,I just kept the Bishop's Wife. The package was too diverse to appeal. The Bishop's Wife was wonderful and inspiring. There are angels -- I've encountered them -- just need a reminder. Kaye
4,This is an amazing book with mandie's usual fun mysteries,"Mandie and her best friend are going up to visit their friend Jonathan in New York. Of course Mandie finds a mystery and they get invloved in many mysterious things. Mandie and Jonathan get trapped on a roof, Mandie is sick, they're late for dinner and they see snowball(mandies cat) below about to fall and die! What will they do? read it and find out!"
5,Just what I needed,"This book gave me a lift so I kept it by my bedside...but it kept sprouting wings and traveling around the house. I have three daughters aged 11 to 15 and they loved it. One started sending the motivational quotes by IM to her friends. They loved the quotes and want the book, too. Now I am picking up several for quick gifts...it works for all ages. From teen to granny, there is quick, easy stress relief on every page of this book. I finished with the realization that our only limitations in life are those we put on ourselves."
2,Won't last as long as an OEM battery,After buying one of these 1.4 Ah batteries to replace an Porter Cable 12v 2.0 Ah battery I was satisfied at first but it wore out fast and eventually wouldn't hold a charge. I Would recommend having your original batteries (or this battery if you already bought it) rebuilt by Batteries Plus which will bring it up to 2.0 Ah for around $35.00 per battery.
2,Didn't go far,"I bought this in 2006 and it worked as advertised, taking about 20 charges over 18 months, then it got to the point where it would last only a minute or two and then wouldn't take a charge at all. Stay away from this one if you want it for more than a year."
2,Not sure how long this will last,"12-volt Battery packs for my Porter Cable drill are hard to come by, so I was pleased to see this item on Amazon. There was one in stock, so I bought it. But, so far the performance is well below expectations. Based upon a recommendation in another review, I took my two non-functioning Porter Cable batteries to Batteries Plus and had them rebuilt. $82 later, I have two packs that exceed the performance of the new TopCell."
3,killing off Kelton(Gale Harold) was the dumbest thing you could have done,"I was looking forward like alot of other fans for this show it looked really good, something with Gale in it and just a good mystery story that would keep you on the edge of your seat each week. I would not watch it if it came back on unless kelton was somehow alive, but i would buy the DVD if it came out. I would also give Kelton(Gale)5/6 stars."
4,Good resource on early missionarys in Chile,"I visited Tierra del Fuego & Patagonia in March of 2004. When attending a lecture aboard ship regarding the early settlement of this area I was told a good resource book on this area was Lucas Bridges book ""The Uttermost Part of the Earth"" - it was a great recommendation. I was able to obtain the book via Interlibrary loan (believe it came from a library in Minnesota). A great read! Lucas was one of 6 children of Thomas Bridges a missionary sent from England to Christianize the natives. 5 of his 6 children were born there. The book doesn't deal that much with actually missionary (ie: church) work as it does the experiences of Bridges family members with the native tribes. What endurance those people had! I'd recommend it to anyone interested in that part of the world."
4,Unexpected,"I read this book years ago. I bougth it in a little museum in Usuahia, and I enjoyed it very much. As a native argentinian this is a part of our history that has been largely ignored. The whole of Patagonia is fascinating and this story of a british boy growing up wild among incredibly primitive indians could have been written by Rudyard Kipling. Is a story of adventure and discovery written by the protagonist himself. I don't have the book anymore and I am looking for a used copy. I am sure my second reading will not disappoint me."
2,"Lacks maps, other info","A disappointing hiker's guide to Utah. Lists lots of hikes, gives a 1-5 dificulty rating, 1-10 ""appeal rating"", length of hike, location, cursory instruction to get to trailhead. Hikes are organized by 6 regions in the state. The hike's description lacks info on altitudes (Does it climb 600 or 6000 feet? Does it start at 6000 feet so I need a coat?) The book's only map is a state map showing location of all the hikes - no individual maps of trails or roads to trailheads. Almost every hike suggests where you should go to buy a topo of the area. Why repeat this boilerplate for every hike? The trail descriptions don't explain the reason for the appeal rating. (Is it great red-rock vista, or a nice stream, or just developed campsites that make the hike a ""7""?)"
1,utah hiker,"My biggest problem with this book besides no maps and scant detail on hikes is this... No pictures! Notta, nil, nothing. This book desperately needs a major revision."
2,Plentiful hiking options but little guidance.,"So many hikes in this book covering all regions of the state. What I initialy liked about this book, and which is its strong point, is each trail's length, physical difficulty rating, and beauty rating. Such a nice way to lay out a hiking book, thus you can ask 'where could I do a two night backpacking trip at a certain elevation in a certain part of the state?' Trouble is, for example, at least one late spring a couple years ago, I found a hike in the La Sals starting near Castle Valley/Moab which sounded perfect (moderate elevation- snow melted but not hot desert) but the beginning of the hike was on private cattle property- the trail was difficult to follow and closed by multiple gates! After a couple hours I had to head back to the car and rethink my mini-vacation. I've had similar trouble with a couple other trails- difficult to know what you're supposed to do in these situations; keep going and hope for the best?"
4,much better than the title or cover,"I've worked in optics and interferometry and was absolutely delighted with this book.Lots of tricks for hardware-store improvisation!If you're not a tinkerer, this is not the book for you. There's little technical depth and no really good experiments or instrument design in it. (good experiments for this kind of book have either enormous educational value or reproduce poorly-understood phenomena).If you know what you're doing though, this is where to look for tips on building your own optical bench, etc. All the student tricks I'd picked up along the way and then some. I've recommended it to a couple of past colleagues, too."
5,Awesome fred,"Some times it is hard to understand how fantastic games never get noticed. Probably one of the most intriguing console games out in the market. This is not a vannila FPS/TPS shooter or action game. More of a adventure game with action. Very creative story, addictive game play. Very well executed with good production values. Prefect balance of audio, graphics and game play."
1,I now rate it 4 after talking to vendor,"I'm at the garage in the early part of the game. I have read every walk through and help I can find so I know I've done everything right and after performing the required task the game just sits there!The task is suppose to open a gate, it doesn't, and I can go no further in the game. Don't know if it's a defect or what. But what a waste of money!Update: Apparently the vendor has had an issue with this part in the game in that it isn't intuitive to the rest of the game as to what you do. If you simply use the triangle button to go into ""interactive"" mode it works. So I will update my grade to a 4 star."
5,Valentines Day Gift,I cna't wait to give this for valentines day. It is his favorite band and he does not have this CD yet. I am sure he will be thrilled. Very well packaged!
2,"I want to like it, but...","Night Ranger was the first concert I went to and I've enjoyed their music for over 20 years. I was glad to see them coming out with a new studio recording and had high hopes. I just think they could've done so much better than this. I've listened to it a few times, trying to see if it grows on me, but it just leaves me disappointed. There are a few good songs but, overall, it seems like their best days are behind them. I hate to say that, because they're a great live group (I saw them a couple of years ago, with .38 Special) and I've enjoyed their last couple of studio offerings, especially NEVERLAND. The two acoustic remakes (Don't Tell You Love Me, Sister Christian) are pretty good, but it's time to quit living in the past, guys, and deliver up some new classics. If they release anymore albums, I'll definitely check them out and hope for better material, but I doubt I'll listen to Hole In The Sun very much."
1,WTF,This is terrible who told them to release this. What happened to the group who released dont tell me you love me and you can still rock in america. Because you cant with is cd its not even good as a coaster
3,Good try,"Godd melodic album with some good songs. Not as good as the original stuff, but they are older. Glad they didn't change their style like other bands. Worth a listen. Jack Blades still has it."
1,Not Impressed......,I think everuone will agree the movie was great. But this game is a joke. Its not really as fun as i thought it would be. This just might be one of those games that should just stay on T.V. or somthin. --> I think we all remember the superman game<--
4,Be Super!:),"Nice little peoples game. Eventually they get to become all the characters and save the day! Good family fare, interesting but not too difficult for it's target audience:-)"
3,All my kid wants for xmas is this game.,My son and I loved the movie. He played the game at a friend's house and was hooked. The graphics in this game are very smooth much like those in this amazing movie. Its easy to learn to play (my son is 7) even though each level you play as a different character with different abilities and there is a bit of a learning curve adapting to the new controls. I would agree with many of the comments by the reviewer at http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox/835/The-Incredibles/p1/.
4,drink before you listen,sisters are so sleazy. takes a few listens.best if cold weather and warm drink are involved.
1,eh....could've been entertaining....i guess,"This album reminds me of all the reasons why I don't by cds blind.I purchased it because of a profile on the group and the making of the album in the last Paste Magazine. It made Califone sound like a group that experimented with a rich roots sound, combined with old-time blues, rock riffs, and the occasional electronic loop.What I got instead, as best as I can tell, was an interminable, monotonous drone, song after song. Each uninspiring track, which sounded eerily similar to the one that preceded it, was a ghastly mix of background feedback, the same 4 notes intoned by the lead singer, and the occasional dissonant guitar twang.I lay the blame for this experience less on the band than I do on the reviewers who made the disc sound like a moveable musical feast. Perhaps if I had been expecting the musical slow boat to china, I would have enjoyed this drab album more."
5,Foot Air Pump,Very pleased with this foot pump. I took it camping in England and the fact that it is light weight and fairly compact was a huge benefit. It does a great job inflating our queen-size air mattress. The purchase price and the shipping charges were very reasonable. I'm extremely happy with this purchase.
3,"I saw what they did, and it could hae been better","This book gives the readers tips about positive reinforcement and performance recognition. Like a lot of other ""managment"" books it is written really simply, sometimes too simply. The world does not consist of black and white situations, and the book doesn't always acknoledge that. Another point that bothered me was the grammatical style. Any time the book talks about an employee, it uses female gender. ""If you reinforce your colleague, SHE'LL appreciate it"". Can't you reinforce your male coleagues? Other than that, the book does give some good examples, and is written in an easy, reader's friendly atitude."
4,Nails provided don't support the rack,I had to use my own screws to supoort this rack. Other than that it is a good way to display your different wine selections.
4,Great for the price,I bought two of these to display in my kitchen. They only came with short screws so we had to use our own anchors and longer screws to hang into the studs in the wall with all the weight of wine on them. Other than that I love the look of them on my wall.
5,Simple and Just What I Needed,"This is solidly built and stays sturdy with 6 bottles in it. It also looks very nice on my wall. One thing to be aware of... they give you two screws but it doesn't come with the plastic anchors needed to secure this to the wall. Wasn't a big deal because I had some at home, but if you don't have any, you'll need to pick some up from the hardware store."
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!!,It is perfect! I ordered this on Tuesday and got it on Thursday. When I saw the UPS guy at my door I started jumping for joy because I was so excited to receive my wine rack!!! I found a stud in the wall and secured the rack to it and put my bottles in and voila! A beautiful piece of wall art!
4,As good as you would expect,Sturdy build and easy to instal. I just found a stud and put a few screws in it. I usually only keep it half filled but it has held up just fine. No quality issues and no worries about it falling apart.
1,boring ambient drivel!!!,"i heard a cool song on the CBC by divination, hopeing it would be on this cd, well it wasnt. there is nothing worth listening to on this cd. no drums, no cool bass lines, just crap. mr laswell, please bring back TERROR AGAINST TERROR!!"
3,not much help,"I was hoping for some creative ways to use the yoga props, but there were just a very few standard tips. This might be good for a beginner or someone who is pretty limited physically."
2,how do we change this?,"Roger Simon certainly proves that presidential campaigns are a show orchestrated by skillful advisors to the candidates. What he fails to do is tell the reader what exactly he finds wrong with political campaigns being a show. Moreover, if he finds that this show is bad, he should at least tell us what we can do to change this or if there is no hope of changing the way political campaigns are run he should also tell us."
4,A Political Page Turner,"If you are a political novice, you really need to read this book. Not only is it funny but illustrative of how political campaigns are ""media shows' designed to appeal to us on an almost subliminal level. The voting public must take the information that we use to make political decisions with a great deal more seriousness if we are to successfully deal with the issues facing us. Politicians would prefer that we use the same intellect in making these decisions that we do in buying toilet paper. Unfortunatley we are getting what we deserve in our politicians. Roger Simon's book points that out to us."
2,Bully with a poison pen,"I read Simon's earlier book ""Road Show"" and found it humorous, but this book is venonmous. His mean-spirited view exempts only the media (naturally), as he skewers the voters and candidates with Nat'l Enquirer-style gossip and furnishing additional reasons to feel cynical. (As if! as if there aren't enough...)"
5,Old School CD's are the best,"Old School CD's are the best in my opinion. I always buy them used to get the best price. This CD was in excellent condition, arrived quickly and packaged in a safe manner. I am very happy with the seller and product."
3,Not bad for collecting but mastering isn't very good,"A few decent disco and 80's RnB chart singles here, with a few awful generic ones(Dance With You and Freakaholic come to mind) and no decent 12"" versions of anything, mostly single versions. Nothing particularly funky or soulful here either. But the songs are easily previewed online if any are unfamiliar. The problem here is that although the mastering thankfully does not suffer from the loudness war, the majority of tracks are far too bright and lacking in bass. Without tone controls handy, you may want to pass this one up or be forced to keep the volume low. Disc time clocks in at 59:03, so Thump Records probably could have added 2 or 3 more songs."
1,Amazon lists the wrong parts for kia rio,"Amazon is listing parts for the 2008 Kia Rio that do not even exist. These spark plug wires do not fit the 2008 Kia Rio any model. The 2008 Kia Rio in Amazon is listed as a distributorLESS ignition system. The KIA Rio IS a distributorLESS system and therefore does NOT even HAVE a distributor, distributor cap, rotor, OR SPARKPLUG WIRES AT ALL. THEY DO NOT EXIST. Yet Amazon says these parts do exist and will sell them to you wasting time and money. The KIA Rio has 4 cylinders, and 4 spark plugs and on top of the 4 spark plugs there are 4 coils (1 per) and NO distributor, distributor cap, rotor, or sparkplug. wires."
1,not working,"2 times were wrong, are useless, not what you describe and correct errors, I need to work and do not help me here"
4,Excellent AIDS drama about early 1990's,"I've been teaching a course on the AIDS Pandemic at Dowling College on Long Island for 10 years. I use this film in the class because it focuses on an incident in the early 1990's that impacted many people in the central Long Island region (where the College is located)--in other words, for us, it's a local story. Beyond that, this is a finely acted, well-scripted family drama that addresses many issues--from discrimination to lack of communication and its effects on a family's emotional, spiritual, and physical health. John Lithgow does his usual excellent job portraying twin brothers, and Ellen Burstyn's performance as the twin's mother is also riveting. This is an excellent introduction to the pre-drug cocktail era of AIDS, when AZT was about the best hope there was. But what could be bleak turns into a wonderful story of human courage and proves, once again, that you don't need a scatillion dollars of special effects to make a touching film."
4,Very Good,"I had the fortune to attend the course in Linear Robust Control with Dr. Green at Cornell University and used the book as a text. This book is perfect if you have a good understanding of linear algebra as well as optimal control theory. Some of the proposed problems are (I remember the headaches) of high dificulty but having the book along with some good papers written by the autors, makes them much easier. Because of the dificulty of the subject, I read several other books and none was better that this so if you really want to learn Linear Robust Control and care about mathematic rigurousity, this is the book for you. It is best suited as a companion for a course in robust control since the book is not easy at all."
1,Compac 15301 Dlx Closet Freshener,I cannot smell the freshenerss.. At all in the closet or very faintly if you stick your nose to them.
3,eh.,"This product is an okay product, it does have a good smell and all but packaging wise I may have lose out on some fragrance because it in a cheap bag and tie. Buy for the price it may be worth it. Try only in a small, like really small closet and it should be satisfactory."
1,I'm confused.,"hmmmm. Tell me, why I would spend $80.00 for this product when I can purchase all 3 (seperately) for $69.50?"
5,Canon DK100i USB Calculator,"Love it! It will be especially helpful when doing my taxes! And, I got it cheaper than buying a new calculator! Thanks for sending it so promptly to me!"
2,Not a HID-class device,"This is not a USB HID-class device, so it requires a driver, which is only available for Windows. It does not work in OS X. Disappointing."
2,"Adequate calculator, but numpad function is borked","Unfortunately, the USB on this one doesn't work as a keyboard, as it really should have. I bought this to work with a Macbook, so I have an overpriced calculator with no bonus features. Nice, Canon.That said, if you have a Windows machine, this looks like a great product; it just does me no good."
4,Its handy,Like the additional cable attachment and also the elevated screen for a better view. Good price for a good size.
3,Wish they gave the actual size of the calculator,"I have a large calculator that my wife likes to use. When I read through the specifications for this product, it said that the product was 10 inches by 8 inches, by 2 inches. That would be only slightly larger than the one I have now, and would be a perfect size. Unfortunately those are the dimensions for the packaging, and not the calculator. Why would I care what the size of the packaging is? The calculator itself is only 5 inches by 4 inches. This is much smaller than I wanted. Because of the cost and the fact that I can use it on my laptop, I plan on keeping it, but it bothers me that the calculator size is misleading. On the plus side, Amazon got this product to me very fast!"
4,"Decent Greatest Hits compilation with rare ""Stateside"" tunes","The liner notes and recording quality of this CD is on par with similar greatest hits albums. However, the last two tracks, ""I Can't Believe My Ears"" and ""I Wish I Wasn't Me Tonight"" are VERY difficult to find, as those two tracks had been released only in England when Del was between record labels. That makes this a must for Del collectors, but is a fine sample for those who simply want a good sampling of a great performer's work."
3,good and bad,"The bag itself is nice. Soft leather and plenty of room without being too large. BUT--- I didn't walk 2 miles and the cheap strap broke. I almost lost everything over the cliff. I was able to resew the strap but double folded it before stiching. They had only sewn thru 1 layer and it quickly frayed and ripped out of the stitching. If you buy this, resew it before using it."
2,Leather Waist Pack,"This item arrived on time and until today (March 27) I was satisfied with the product itself. But no longer--the waist band has separated from the waist pack, and who does leather repairs any more? Shoddy workmanship.Mary"
1,DO NOT buy this product,"the zipper pulled out of the middle section. It's not worth .30, let alone what I paid for it.."
2,leather waist pouch,"great difficulty in getting order address correct. After a month, received product but also got a duplicate sent to a wrong address."
4,Heartwarming dance tale for all ages,"My 3 and 6 year old daughters enjoy the story for the talkabout dancing and for the ""little sister looks up to big sister"" and ""little sister feeling left out"" themes. The adults in the family get misty-eyed over a little girl's discovery of the beauty of dance (if you've ever shed a tear of joy when Linnea is finally atop the bridge in Monet's Garden, you'll know what I mean). This will be one to save for the next generation :-)Beautiful water-color-ish illustrations appealed to all ages in our family."
2,"Concepts OK, characterization poor, writing clunky","All the characters are without flaws. All of them are noble. All of them are Christian and make a special point of it (one token ""lazy agnostic,"" as if agnosticism were something that could only occur if you hadn't taken the trouble to think about it). Information is frequently repeated, and obvious things are stated instead of being implied. The science aspects are good. The storytelling -- not so much.You might like this book if you're a devoted Christian without high standards."
2,Throwback to the '50's,"A book of manly men, strong women, dull characters and a boring plot. It strongly reminded me of the writing of E. E. Smith and Robert Heinlein, without much of their period charm.If you like that sort of book, than this is a good one for you. If you grew out of the bold scientist/evil alien genre after your teen years, than I recommend you avoid it."
5,BIRDS OF north america,we returned it. Because we already have it.WE LOVE THE BOOK IT HAS A LOT OF GREAT PICTURES AND INFOMATION.
1,Ugliest doorstop I ever saw,"The pictures in this book are ugly and often misleading. Many pictures are of stuffed birds with their feathers ruffled every which way and others (such as the cover raptor) are obviously captive.The information is scant considering the format of the book.Some of the rarer birds (I guess they didn't have mounted specimens of those) were drawn by some incompetent scribbler.The bool is too big for the field, has too little information for reference, is too ugly for the coffee table, and is too expensive for a gag gift.It is a sore excuse for cutting a tree."
4,JPJ Soundtrack -A Nice Piece,"As has been said before. The best here for a Zeppelin fan would be to copy one of the 2- Page Tracks and add it to a compilation, and debate the quality of the second track forever. But this is as I said in my title, a very nice piece. The Madeline Bell vocal cuts are nice ballads. Other reviewers called them 80's-like but they are more like what you require in a soundtrack, and certainly tunes you might find yourself humming. The mix of performers and Jones' do-it-yourself accomplishments are what makes this piece stand out. He is all over the album -on some tracks playing all instruments and singing as well. Perhaps the album is better judged against similar one man-solo efforts by McCartney, Jason Faulkner and Todd Rundgren -not so much for musical similarity, but for ingenuity and skill."
4,WORTH IT FOR BAD CHILD ALONE,"I was finally able to snag a copy of this soundtrack on cd(ajapanese import)I have owned the vinyl copy since the mid 80'sand it has been a long search for the cd. The other reviewershave mentioned the Jimmy Page songs being the best and assumingyou are just a Led Zeppelin fan and a classic/hard rock fan that may be true. However,the true treasure here is Bad Child.This song sounds nothing like the Mighty Zep and that's justfine. Unbelievably John's voice actually comes real close tosounding like Casey from KC and the Sunshine band and that'snot necessarily a bad thing. Musically it has a new wavish,island feel with a cool atmosphere. I'm personally a hugeZeppelin as well as a new wave alternative rock fan and i feelthat there is a little something for everyone on this greatsoundtrack."
5,Tons of RESEARCH,Juanita Leisch is my heroine! She has literally researched details of THOUSANDS of CDV's to come up with her facts for this book. I highly recommend it as it will teach about Civil War costume according to age and social class.
1,!! Pathetic !!,"OK, I can't take it anymore... I read the two reviews and couldn't believe DH could be this good. I then listened to the album... WHAT HAVE YOU TWO BEEN SMOKING???? DH is pathetic, in many cases not being able to carry a tune. On a scale of 0-5: musicians:4, backup vocalists:3 and DH:-2. Normally, I believe if you can't say anything nice about someone, don't say anything at all but, I couldn't let this one go by..."
1,Installation Gliches,"Not sure how to rate this product since Im having installation issues. I've contacted Nova Development technical support and I'm waiitng for a replacement disk. Weird thing is, it won't install on my Toshiba Laptop (home) but it installs on my Dell Desktop (work). I checked with their Technical Support and they assured me its not my computer. I was able to play around with the program at work but that wasn't the purpose of my purchase. I need to be able to use the program for my HOME based business not at my primary workplace (I would like to keep my job!!!) So anyway I'm waiting for my replacement disk and if it doesn't work I will be requesting a refund and I'll purchase the newest version...But I do like the program and would love it even more if I can get it to install on my pc."
2,Not a User Friendly Program,"I have been a Microsoft Picture It! user for 5 years and it just took it's last tank. I also use Print Master for the simple basics. This program I just bought will take me six months to learn. The tutorials are almost useless. I regret that I bought this. I write a simple parent/student newsletter, church flyers and announcements, and I needed something I could get in and learn quickly...this is not it!"
3,bad shipping and bad box,When I first received this software I could not install it. The tech support department was very helpful and replaced the bad disk for me. Inexplicably it took nearly six weeks for the disk to be mailed to me but once I got it I was able to install the software.The only real issue I have with the software is that the box has nearly nothing to do with the art that is in the box. I was looking for the image of glasses and was told that they were not included. When I called to find that image or the picture of the globe on the box I was told that those images are not included. I really wish that the box better reflected the art and displayed the contents of the box better. I think the only real problem I have with this program is the box.
5,Great value for the money!,"As a small business owner, I don't have the time to learn the high end graphics programs. With Publihser Pro, most of the learning curve has been eliminated. You don't create anything as much as you assemble it. You are given hundreds of basic templates and you can change text, add graphics or change colors to your heart's content. You may not create something that a professional using expensive software would but you won't have to spend months having to learn how either. For something under $100, this is the best that I have found."
1,Went back to Microsoft Publisher,"Great concept for software, but most unstable. This product required far too much care to remain functional. I finally deleted it and went back to Microsoft Publisher."
2,Not so great....:(,"Not very user friendly, and I have been using computer desktop publishing software for over 20 years...."
1,No Difference,I reaped no benefit from the use of this product. I chalk it up to it being nothing but 'snake oil'...
2,no substance,"was very disappointed with this book. All it's good for is a brief run down through history of secret societies. I won't ruin/reveal ending but it's vague and offers no substance to it's claims. The author also reveals himself to be a religious man, which for me damages his credibility on the subject matter. Save your money and buy something else."
1,Fluff,"There isn't much information to be gleaned from the book that couldn't all have been covered in one chapter. The author pads the book with MULTIPLE REPITITIONS of the same information. It is SO POORLY WRITTEN that anyone reading it will tend not to believe the little information presented because the author loses all credibility.If you are looking for answers to the rapid cultural, political, and economic changes in the USA and around the world, I recommend Ted Flynn's ""Hope of the Wicked"" subtitled ""The master Plan to Rule the World"". Click on my ID and read my review of same."
2,A fair introduction to the occult,"The book provides a decent overview of the various occult organizations in our history that likely strongly influence that history. However, the review is not well written with considerable conjecture and filtered through an extreme right-wing political viewpoint. Thus, it is a bit of a challenge to decipher what is truth."
2,Brotherhood of Darkness,"A well-written volume, but subject matter has been treated numerous times before by many authors"
2,good lord,"i suggest that you read jim marrs' ""the rise of the fourth reich"". it's much more detailed and doesn't have that psycho christian overtone to it. organised religion is just one more problem in this world."
2,Paranoid hyperbole,"The author of ""Brotherhood of Darkness"" seems to operate under the assumption that a collection of random quotations and events, juxtaposed with quasi-inflammatory rhetoric, makes for good reading. Dr. Monteith is just that -- a medical doctor, not a scholar. His assertions of Evil running rampant in the world today benefit only from weak supporting evidence -- if any. The primary thesis in the ""Brotherhood of Darkness"" is dubious, to say the least. Truly, if such a subversive and malevolent society did exist, and was as powerful as Monteith asserts, wouldn't it have prevented the publication of this expose?To be sure, there is evil in this world. However Christians would do well to avoid this book, as well as any other that touts similar sensationalistic paranoia."
1,Oh no not more ramblings.,"More paranoid gibberish from the conspiracy nuts; 911 was organized by Bush, water fluoridation is part of an evil plot, vaccines cause cancer and more such nonsense."
5,Scary,"This book is very enlightening and very scary. I knew there were forces of evil in the world, but I didn't realize they were so plentiful and so formidable!"
2,Not the same 8x8,I bought these and an 8x8 memory book at the same time. These were supposedly refills for the book I bought. They are about 1/2 inch smaller then those that came in the book. So useless. Didn't return them because I'll find something else to do with them.
3,Confusing photo ---> Ordered the wrong item,"I was excited to be scrapbooking again, so I immediately added some square refill pages to my order. The image looked exactly like what I'd used before, but I didn't pay a ton of attention and actually needed the 12 by 12 inch refills. Imagine my surprise when I got tiny things in the mail! No idea what I'm going to do with them; I had no idea they even made scrapbooks like that.Basically, read very carefully before you order. Other than that, looks like a good product."
2,looney tunes,"This wasn't what I thought it was- I wanted more on the Michagan Frog- there wasn't any cartoon with him in it, just some feature- very disappointed-"
1,Shame on you Warner Bros.!!!,"Shame on you, plese continued the Golden collection series. The Fans want's more new Looney Tunes to DVD. Give what the fans want. We want it all.... Not this. Only Ccartoons that the fans alredy have from before. Nothing new here on DVD. I'm a huge Looney Tunes fan. Why did Warner stopped the Golden collectin, make me wonders. Give me more Golden collection and I'll gladly buy it..... The Cartons is great..... But Warner should listen to the buyers. There are so many good ones left. Why they not continued. I hope they will returned too the series soon, very soon."
1,Big Let Down,It will be a rough christmas with no new/old Bugs Bunny. Someone needs to inform the number crunchers at WB that all audiences are not created equal. This is important work. And fun. Even if the sets have to be smaller-release the stuff in 2 dvd sets-but release the stuff we don't have. We want it. please.
1,Pointless to collect,Even as a cartoon collector I have to admit this is pointless to own! Why make a dvd of stuff that has already beenreleased? I think someone was just thinking of the money. That's ok but I wont be spending money on any more of this series since it has clearly hit a wall.
5,Forgiveness,"This is a well written book on forgiveness. It reference the scriptures and what God says about forgiveness and how important it is to forgive. If you're having problems with forgiveness, it's a must read book. I ordered some to give to others and I will be ordering more."
1,DID NOT WORK!,"Shipment was quick as usual and set up was very simple so no complaints there.However this thing does not work.We used it the first time at our cottage and it kept ringing, we went back to the cottage thinking there was something wrong-well there was nothing wrong. So we figured maybe there was a glitch that one time and we decided to give it another try. After 1 week of use, it started phoning us again. ANd yes, it was false alarm again!Overall this was very inconevient for us. We wanted something that we could trust but this alarm kept going off for no reason.I wish I would have spent a bit more and purchased something better."
5,Great Product,"Simple, very effective and a good value. Just tested again with fridge. Still working after 4 years (we remove battery when not in use). No need for us to buy the more expensive models."
3,good product,Purchased one for my own home and one for my son in law. Set up fairly easy. Tested one by putting it in the freezer and it called my cell number as expected. Good price for a very valuable item.
4,quite good looking,The style looks nice. It keeps you warm in pretty low temperature. But be careful with the static electricity in Winter.
4,New found respect for an Ancient Practice,"I admit to having been highly sceptical of this discipline. The word psychic to me had conjured up images of ""Madame Marie"" or some other soothsayer or con artist. While the profession is, admittedly rife with such creatures, Joan Pancoe is an entirely different case. A powerful, highly formidable spirit, she is an outstanding therapist who's been in private practice in New York for over 25 years. She is, in short, the real deal.The book is fairly advanced material. I found that I had to go back and read some elementary Taoist and Chi Gung texts to get some foundation in the concepts discussed. It would help if the reader did that in advance. The book is channeled and the examples are taken from her cases. I highly recommend this."
4,Low Cost FUN!,"Whether you know Half Life or don't, this game will entertain you. The extra games give you a bundle you can't pass up for the price."
5,One of the best,"This was my first game! I was just playing safe here! I have already played halflife, but portal is great game also!"
2,"Great Game, Terrible Sound Problem","I can't speak highly enough about the gameplay in Half-Life 2 and Portal. Phenomenal games. But the crackly sound problem is very real and very annoying. It happens way to often. I really can't believe how little EA / Valve care that they let this bug stay in the game and have not released a patch for it. The looong loading times I can deal with, but the sound problem really gets on my nerves.Is it still worth getting? Yes, but only if this is the only way you have of playing Half-Life 2 and Portal, and if you're prepared to restart the game often when the sound goes screwy."
2,Game gave me ERROR!!,"I got this game a year ago and in the beginning was enjoying my play through it, but as I got to a certain point in the game I have not been able to play it. The big problem is the loading. Its starts with Highway 17 and going through a tunnel, it loads, but then it brings up that there is a error. I doubt I can return it since its been a year but Id like to know if there is a way to fix this or if there is a way to trade it in for the same game."
3,Feels old,"I liked portal and wanted to play team fortress, so I bought this. I loved these games, but they are old and it doesn't seem like they'll ever be updated. No achievements or anything. I haven't played it in months."
2,Orange Box (360) > Orange Box (PS3),"for you achievement whores out there with a PS3 think twice. PS3 version does NOT have trophies and the frame rate was terrible. I had no problems on the 360 version and I play on a 42"" LED-LCD 120Hz"
5,No Excuse to miss out on this,Seeing as the price has come down quite a bit since release there is really no reason to miss out on this experience.If you like first person shooters the Half-Life Series is top notch.If you like multiplayer Team Fortress 2 is a lot of fun.And everyone needs to experience Portal.You get a lot of entertainment in this package. The only reason not to get this would be if you don't like first person perspective games.
3,this better be worth the money,"The first thing I want to say is that it took way to long to ship. It also has no user manual, and that may be due to the manufacturer, but for as many games that are in this package, it's foolish to assume that the user will learn the individual game's controls by osmosis!"
4,The Orange Box!,"I bought this game for my son, he says that it is a great game, no complaints. There is one update for the game. He felt like they could have added more updates to team fortress two. Good value for 5 games! (PS3)"
3,The Frame Rate issues are REAL!!,"I had previously played Half-Life on PC and really enjoyed it. The PC controls were clumsy, so I decided to get a real game console and after much consideration decided to get a PS3. It was exciting to see that Half-Life 2 was available, so it was purchased with the console. This has the absolute worst frame rate issues of any PS3 game that I own ( Resistance, Resistance 2, Killzone, God of War, etc.) They definitely affected play in the Water Hazard significantly. As much as I like the Game and look forward to the next series I hope that Valve gets the PS3 platform together."
4,"Very good games, Portal and Half Life 2 are awesome.","I got this because I stopped PC gaming around the time HL 2 came out. Half Life 2 is an awesome FPS with a good story line. Some great sci fi and horror stuff throughout. Lots of gameplay to keep you busy, however I got bored around the time to play Episode 2 and 3, but will maybe pick it up someday.Portal is probably even better than HL2. I played Portal 2 first, and it was just as fun to run through the original. The only problem is once you get going, you've probably gotten 3/4 of the way through in just a few hours. I'd recommend buying used as it's not really worth $50 though."
5,The ORANGE Box for PS3,"5 games ? the price ranges from 25 to 60 bucks and that's a deal anywhere .Now critics have complained about glitches and I've beaten all of these games and I have yet to see an issue.Team Fortress 2 occasionally has connectivity issues and has a millisecond lag, but playable and fun .Portal is a great puzzle game and one of my favorites to mess around on (get Portal 2 if you like the original)Half-Life is a great game all around ,but this compilation includes the full sequel and two episodes that act as continuations of the story and more game !I give is 5 stars cause it's almost a steal .The ORANGE Box is great on XBox 360 and PS3, but if you want to play it the way it should be played get it on PC . I say you won't be disappointed either way. I put PS3 cause I bought it for PS3 and I can't complain at all !GET IT YOU WON'T REGRET IT, IT'S ESSENTIAL TO ANY GAMERS LIBRARY"
3,More useful than might be supposed,"The title is somewhat misleading. Amidon has included some material from all the heresies that Epiphanius deals with. This consists of the description of the heresy given, and some of the narrative. The omitted portions consist of the refutation by Epiphanius himself, which in many cases is much lengthier.The work will inevitably be judged against the complete two-volume translation done during the same period by Frank Williams. Had this not appeared, Amidon's work would have been invaluable. As it is, we are fortunate that two specialists should have attempted this work, which previously had attracted no translator into a modern language.The work may well be useful to those less interested in Epiphanius than in those he detested."
1,Bad set of bulbs,"I've used these bulbs for years, buying them at Home Depot. However, with this batch we had 2 of the 5 bulbs that we bought burn out within the first 2 weeks after putting them in the lamp. It appears that the solder at the base of the bulb ended up melting thereby causing the contacts to the filament to be lost. The supplier of these bulbs was not Amazon.com. Amazon.com did reimburse us back our purchase price."
3,"Cool idea, but over-priced","I still haven't figured out why these Masterpiece editions cost so much money. $40 would be a much better price. The book is only about 100 pages long and isn't really the most informative book on the subject of Bounty Hunters.I like the idea of a 12"" Aurra Sing, but the figure is just so poorly done. The head is huge compaired to the frail body. And the body has almost no articulation - very barbie like."
4,A collector must have,"I thought this figure was great, my favorite of the three Star Wars Masterpiece sets. More articulation would have been nice, but the clothing and accessories were exceptional. The book is up to par, with a number of photos that I have not seen anywhere else."
3,#30 is ssooo sad!!!! and good,"The plot is about a missing turkey, which didn't really appeal to me, but otherwise the book was good. The end made me hungry for the next book!!!! If the mystery weren't so boring, this would be one of the best Mandie books ever."
4,Should have been called 'Mandie and the Turkey Theft',"Joe will be leaving for collage soon, and Mandie tries to put off the parting as much as she can. But things start looking even darker when Dr. Woodard disappears along with the Thanksgiving turkey. This time Joe puts no restrictions on her, seeing as the missing person is his father.All their wanderings lead to a very surprising-and scary-discovery.This book could have been better. I was puzzled that Lois Gladys Leppard titled the book 'The Long Goodbye' when the goodbye doesn't come until the end, and takes up about 2 or 3 pages, that's it. It should have been called 'Mandie and the Turkey Theft' or something like that."
5,If it ain't broke...,"A great product like this is going to be hard to beat. Gerber got it right when they came up with the Gator grip... The abilities of the knife are endless... The blade is sharp and good, sharpening was not a problem, I have had more than my share of knives and I appreciate the hardness of the blade because it holds an edge relatively well and reduces the need for lots of sharpening... however using a steel routinely helps drastically."
5,Very Nice Gator,"When holding this knife, it just feels right. It's not a flashy design, but the feel and fit of the grip is very nice, and the blade size and shape is very intuitive and practical when cutting. I generally prefer drop point non-serrated blades, and this one's nice.I also own the Gator II, and I like that one as well. This knife's blade is 154CM stainless steel.This knife is not an easy one-hand opener, and isn't designed for quick deployment.It comes with a basic Gerber sheath, which is an initially-tight-fitting single chamber pouch.Made in the USA. (Sheath made in China.)I definitely recommend it. I'd buy it again."
1,Way too hard to sharpen,"I am very disappointed with this knife because the steel is tempered way too hard. The knife was fairly sharp right out of the box, but the edge was rough and I wanted it much sharper. Now I can sit down with all of my wife's kitchen knives, and several are expensive laminated Japanese knives and Wusthof knives, along with a few cheap ones, and sharpen all of them freehand to the point that they will shave hair off my arm while watching a football game, before half time. However, this knive required three hours of work with a Lansky knife sharpening kit just to get a decent edge. A good knife should hold an edge without being overly difficult to sharpen. If you don't know how to sharpen a knive, then I'd keep looking if I were you."
1,Broken on receipt,"My husband bought this for a fishing trip to Canada. When he opened the package on the day he was to use it the screen had several squiggly lines across it and they never went away. It made it hard to read the display. I contacted the company (Hummingbird) when he returned for a return authorization- had to hold on for over 25 mintues to get through to Customer Service- and the person who finally answered listened to my problem and said ""send it back to us"" and hung up. No address to send it to, no return authorization number, no suggestion of how long it would take or how they would repair or replace it. I don't have time today to go through another call but I guess that is the only way I will resolve this issue. Not very satisfied with the outcome so far."
3,Color Disappointing,"I ordered these in Ellis. The color of the actual socks really doesn't match what is pictured on the site. On the site pictures, Ellis looks to be more of a blue/purple with some pink and mixed in (maybe my settings?) and they are actually a very dark navy blue, red and white. MUCH darker than I'd imagined. The material is soft though. I will probably be returning them however, as they are definitely not the colors I thought."
4,GREAT CD,"I LOVE SALSA, AND THIS CD HAS SOME GREAT MUSIC TO LISTEN TO. I CAN SIT HAVE A DRINK AND LISTEN TO THIS FOR HOURS. NOT THE BEST CD TO DANCE SALSA TO, BUT I THINK HES ONE OF THE SURPERIOR TALENTS OF SALSA MUSIC"
2,Salsa romantica es aburrida,"Que fallo que hayan salseros como Victor Manuelle. La salsa es conocida por sus temas variados hablando de distintas situaciones de la vida por muchas perspectivas. Victor segun parece solo tiene una cosa interesante en su vida, las mujeres. Le entiendo que sea un mamito y a mi tambien me gusta una mujer caliente, pero que hable de otra cosa. Se me hizo imposible oir el disco de principio a fin. Por eso no lo puedo recomendar.Al menos tiene una voz buena, que sea eso porque le guste a una gente. Pero parece que quizas este tomando una direccion diferente despues de este disco. Nunca me imaginaria que cantara una version de ""La Vida es un Carnaval"".P.S. mire la opcion de ""see all my reviews"" de Torres, el que escribio su critica antes de mi para que vea cuanto odia a Victor Manuelle."
5,"Who Knew, JS","These shoes are fabulous and will make any foot look gorgeous. I love mules for their ease and these are also extremely comfortable, even though they're a little higher than I like. I only wish I'd ordered these in several colors. I'm sure JS didn't design them herself and I was a bit skeptical initially about getting anything with her name on them, but I was pleasantly surprised. Pleasantly."
5,A Must Read for any student of Sanctification,"This book was paradigm shifting for me. Even though I had often observed that the Bible uses ""sanctified"" in the past tense I did not know that this is the way it is used the majority of the time in the Bible. Our sanctification is so much more than just our maturation in Christ--there is a huge part of it that has already been accomplished for us at the cross--it is what makes us holy and able to be called ""saints."" This reality of our new identity in Christ then provides the motivation for holy living, which is also a crucial part of sanctification. This book is a clear call for us to start learning and speaking about sanctification in the way that the Bible actually uses the word--if any of this interests you, this book is a must read!"
3,"Works, but it is a lot of work","It took a couple of weeks before I was able to use this product due to a strange design flaw (bug? feature?). If you load it on a Windows machine that does not have a ""C:\"" drive it will report ""system contains low memory"" and not run. This little feature is not covered in the manual or revealed by tech support. Fortunately, I found the answer in a newsgroup. I have reported it to Corel (Procreate) and hope they will at least note it on future manuals (or fix it). I named one of my drives ""C"" and loaded it there.Now that it runs I find it does an excellent job on fuzzy edged things if you select and tweak and tweak, but for most product work the Photoshop pen tool works faster. I will keep it and use it occasionally. It would be good for manipulated portrait work."
5,Getting the Job Done,"This book is a good example of a text that actually helps the reader get something done- namely, create and refine an instructional program for any setting or audience. Dr Bruce takes you from a blank page to a well designed, efficient training course in a step-by-step manner. What impressed me most was the skill with which Dr Bruce not only presents the critical ID concepts, but also shows in great detail how they can be applied."
4,Good music,"The recording quality is pretty good, the music is pretty much like all of their other discs. Good stuff! A bit lacking on variety however."
2,Didn't like.,I had heard a song by Robin and Linda Williams that I absolutely loved. I had never heard of them before. I picked up this CD hoping to find more of the same but was disappointed. This will probably cause me to not purchase any further product from them.
5,Happy,I have used this headset for two years several hours a day because I have a hearing loss. I finally broke the headset I had and am so happy to be able to buy a replacement. I like this particular headset because I use the L/R adjustment and the feature that makes speech clearer. And I love that I can walk around the house or even outside and still listen to TV/Music. This order arrived quickly and in perfect shape.
4,Great but not perfect,"I bought this headphone for a couple of months now. I like it very much. It produced excellent quality sound most of the time. However, it sometimes has static noises, especially when I move around the house. Also, the three volume adjustment wheels on the right earphone are not well designed. They are on the back of the earphone and higher than its base, very often when I laid down on a couch or a bed, the wheels accidentally changed position because of the contact with couch or pillow and altered the volume unexpectedly.Sennheiser RS 140 Wireless Balanced Headphones----------Five years now, it still works perfectly. Great product."
4,"Enjoying Movies, TV & Music Again","Even with hi-tech digital self-adjusting hearing aids I was having difficulty understanding tv dialogue and music lyrics about 65% of the time,especially women and childrens voices. Upon receipt and after overnight battery charging I hooked up the DS-140 headphones to my Bose surround sound system (that I use to control my plasma tv,cd and dvd player and radio) and tested the headphones on each. Wow! I can now understand the dialogue and lyrics to the music without my having to put my hearing aids in. The issue was never volume, although my wife complained about my constantly turning it up as my way of compensating, the issue was understanding what was being said in a real time mode. Not now. I'm looking forward to many hours of pleasurable entertainment. One downside seems to be the control button placements on the phones. Not easy to accurately control for a man-size finger."
5,Great Product,Was everything stated and price was a great saving over local purchase. Arrived in two days as stated. Would buy again if needed.
3,"OK, but not as good as it used to be","These cleaning pads work OK, but Swiffer seems to have changed their product to a cheaper version. No longer are there ""Cleaning Cuffs To Trap Large Dirt And Hair Particles"" (as the old product description said). This makes it completely helpless if you didn't do a perfect job vacuuming beforehand."
2,Where is the absorbancy?,"These pads are NOT as absorbant as before ""new and improved"". They leak when you are trying to remove the used pad.As the other reviewer mentioned they do not have that cuff and don't get all the hair/crumbs. Must vacuum beforehand."
3,System getting way too expensive to use...,I have had this system for about six months now and it is nice in that it keeps your hands out of dirty mopping water....BUT by the time you buy the starter kit and have to replace the cleaning pads and the cleaning solution frequently it is beginning to be too costly to use and their price seems to be increasing all the time. P&G is making big money off of replacement pads and solution.
4,I'd use this before dragging out the old mop n bucket!!!,"It might be a little costly, but it's very easy to put on a pad and quickly clean the floor. I can use one pad for the kitchen and bathrooms. You may need to use more than one if your area is large. I'd rather use this than drag out a large bucket, slosh dirty mop water around and then have to dump it out. I did hear it isn't safe for pets, we don't have any so I suppose it is ok on our floors. It helps to use the Swiffer Sweeper to pick up small particles before using the wetjet pads."
1,Use a terry cloth instead.,"I like the swiffer itself, but the cleaning pads are expensive (and not very environmentally friendly). I found that using a cheap terry cloth works just as well as these new pads. I just throw the cloth in the washer once i'm done. Endlessly reusable."
3,Great for you first machine,"It's a neat machine, that does the job pretty well. If you choose the hard setting plan on butting the finished product into your regular freezer to finish it up. Put a fun machine all the same and a great thing to do with the kids."
1,Piece of crap,"I bought this product at a garage sale where the lady said she had not used it previously. We tried to make ice cream with it for the first time, and it kept making a grinding noise and we had to hold down the lid to make the ice cream. The second time, it refused to work at all and we didn't have any ice cream. Both times we used the hard setting. This product sucks. Don't buy it."
4,Sift Clean Liners (36in x 40in),"I received the order within a day or two of ordering which is great. I was surprised how fast the order arrived. The size fits perfect for the litter box. I have a large box with a cover. The cats do not tear them up as they both have their claws. I would recommend these to anyone who ask.Mary, Rock MI"
2,Not for Me,My cats tore these up almost immediately- they both like to dig around and so they shredded the plastic pretty quickly. It also did not fit my litter box very well.
4,Empty capsules--full warranties,"Hey! What can one say about empty gel capsules? They arrived in a timely fashion and I have not grown a tail, so I ""assume"" there are no harmful contaminants therein lurking. I would do business with this seller again; the quality and timeliness of delivery of the product left nothing to be desired."
2,Not worth it...,"This may work for smaller cats or babies but not for bigger cats like mine it was messy and did not help me for daily cleaning, again this will work for smaller cats."
5,"Great product - fast, easy, effective","Eliminates the daily scooping. You just pick up the edges of the top sheet, and let the clean liter sift through the holes. There is no odor anymore. I couldn't be more pleased by this product."
4,Great Value,"Sifters is the only way to go. I first saw similar sifters at Petsmart, but they were double the price - they also discontinued selling them, so I'm very glad I found this on Amazon. I typically use 2 sheets each time and still find it to be a good value BUT it would be nice if the sifting holes were made a bit smaller."
2,NOT A FAN!!!,"These things are ENTIRELY TOO THIN to benefit any normal cat!!! Had to use three or more to sift, because cats clawed thru while covering there mess. Thought item was to come with 2 basic pan liners, only came with 1 and also too thin for any benefit!!Definetely will NOT buy again!!! Better off with my automatic cleaner and changing weekly"
3,good but one serious flaw,"I'm pleased with the quality of the pictures but the shutter speed is very slow, as is the startup time of the camera, the time between shots and the zoom. I realy miss a lot of nice pictures of my kids because they just don't hang around in the sme position for the minute or two it takes me to open the case and zoom."
5,Monet Playing Cards,"On 1 December 2012, my (very youthful) 82 Mother was in an auto accident. She has walked away from 5 accidents in the last 2-3 years. Non were her fault. I was furious that they let her walk away from this one. She has broken ribs, a fracture in her back, etc. I gave her these for Christmas and she loves them. We are both quite fans of the Impressionist Era! It is going to take her a long time to get through this accident, but she is a card player at heart. Hint: Never play poker with her!"
5,Great look into penmaking,"I had been considering getting into pen turning to expand my woodworking hobby so I got this book to see what the craft is about. After reading this book, it definitely is something I will pursue. This book does a great job of explaining all the different angles involved with the different types of products you can use. I feel that I am much better educated about the craft and look forward to turing my first pen.Great book."
4,Good Book,"Very good book for beginners. If you have been turning pens for a while you will not find this book as informative. However, they have some pretty good ideas on turning pens and adding different materials to make into pens. The book is worth the money for a beginner or even an experienced pen turner wanting to brush up on the basics."
1,dissapointing,This book isn't really good for anything. There are much better sources for learning the three card monte and the shell game (school of scoundrels is the best source IMO). His dice switch is completely unpractical and not used by real cheats. Save your money.
2,More a pamphlet than a book!,"Like one of the other reviewers, I also heard the author on Stern's radio show promoting the book. Unfortunately, the book is _very_ small (73 pages) and has fairly large type. There just ain't much here.90% of the book is devoted to slight-of-hand scams like 3 Card Monte and so on. But those are better-explained in more traditional books on card magic and manipulation. The street hustling portion of the book is entertaining, but there just isn't enough of it to make the book worth [the price].The publisher, Loompanics, has a number of fairly bizarre yet fascinating books out there that are pretty entertaining and informative. Unfortunately, THE REAL WORK just isn't one of their better efforts. If they sold this as an electronic download for a few bucks, that might be one thing; but [this price]for a 73-page paperback? No way."
4,All Disney Fans Must see this film,"I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Walt Disney's life story unfolded in this documentary film. It keeps the viewers attention with ample film footage of Walt at work and giving riveting interviews. I especially enjoyed the part where they show Walt Disney's first studio as it was in the twenties and as it is now because I live a few blocks from the location.My only complaint about the film is it cuts off a lot of Walt Disney's interviews after only a few comments, which appeared very interesting on the screen. It would be nice to see Walt Disney's interviews in their entirety."
3,"If You Are a Disney Fan, Don't Myth This DVD","This is must-have if you live for Disney. We really like the mouse, but everyone should watch this once if even if you are not a Mickey fan. Rent it, but don't buy if you aren't. If you like Disney movies, Disneyland, and buy anything if it has Mickey Mouse painted on it, then you'll have to buy this and watch it over and over."
2,Absurd Price Structure of Color Laser Toner,"I could buy a brand new color laser printer for the price of replacing all the toner cartridges, even at Amazon ""discount"" prices, this is absurd. I have a Drum replacement warning light now as well. Once the Drum is expired I will buy a new printer instead of a new Drum. Not very green of me, a shame, the printer still works fine, but HP really sticks it to you on the price of expendables."
4,toner replacement,excellent product. this is oem. i didin't want to take a chance with those drill and fill replacements. i spent a few extra dollars for peace of mind
3,Worth a laugh or two,"If you liked Dickson's earlier novel ""Hoka"" then you'll probably also like this one. Written in a similar style, it's lighthearted and amusing in all the right places but probably not the sort of book that you'll put away on the shelf to read over and over again."
3,Reprint from a Master of SF,"For those of you who have yet to collect all you can of Gordon R. Dickson, this volume will make it possible to collect three of his light SF tales inexpensively.I'm sorry to say I've heard that Gordon R. Dickson died 31 Jan 2001 from asthma complications. He was one of my favorite authors. While his Dorsai SF and Dragon Knight fantasy series were my favorites of his works, pretty much everything he published was worth reading. I hope SF publishers will find some good editors and republish more collected editions of his works."
3,"Great book, but did not meet expectations","Don't judge a book by its cover.I saw the picture of the heavily armed bear and hastily purchased the book without reading the title. Working under the assumption that this was a how-to guide to train bears in the arts of war, I increased my personal arsenal and hatched plans to break into the local zoo while I waited for the book to be shipped.Fortunately the shipping was handled so promptly and professionally that it arrived early into my planning stages. This saved me a great deal of money and possibly prevented me from having to serve jail time for my late night bear liberation efforts.While this book is not a training manual for creating your personal army of armed bears, it is an enjoyable collection of short stories and I would suggest it to any fan of the English language."
3,Too big to be funny,"The three storrys in this books are neither really funny like the ""Hoka"" tales, for that the bears here are just too big, nor is there much suspense. Oh, granted, they are all well written and not unpleasant to read. However one would wish that Gordon R. Dicksons last book were more memorable."
5,All Around Great Product,"This MP3 player is a steal for the price! For once, the earphones are excellent!! The quality of the sound is fantastic, considering that the earphones came with the player. I hear no static when I play my music at high volumes. I suggest getting a memory card to boost the player to more than 64mb, because longer songs fill the player to capacity very quickly. The LCD screen is very clear, and the buttons are very nicely laid out. Most importantly, the player's MP3 software was a breeze to load onto my computer. My player was up and running in 2 minutes or less. I definitely suggest this player to anyone wants to get the most for their money."
1,Huh? Thanks for telling me....,"This stupid thing does not even upload the freaking voice saved data. How freaking WORTHLESS is that? I'm sorry, but I can buy a 2 cent voice recorder to just record something if that's what just I want to do. Don't put a freakin recording feature on the stupid thing if you won't let the user upload the data. WORTHLESS."
4,For my first ever MP3 Player...,"I've had this mp3 player for about 8 months and it has given me nothing but satisfaction. The size is awesome for taking places and i just wish they made a specialized bag for it. Yeah, your thinking, 64mb isn't that much space. Your right. It will hold around 23 songs. Willing to spend 30 more dollars? Go out and buy a 128mb smart media card. All you have to do is slide it into the player, it's that easy. That's what i did and with that it'll hold about 60 songs. I took off the extra star because on the screen it doesn't show the name of the song very clearly. It'll say something like, if the song is Billie Jean, it will say ""/_BILLIE/_"" across the screen. Otherwise this is a great mp3 player and i think you should go out and buy it!"
1,Mine broke,"After about 3 months it won't power up, and I haven't even received my rebate yet! I have seen other reviews with this same problem. This player only has a 90 day warranty. Other manufactures offer 12 months. I would not buy this player again."
2,Uhhh..........it just DOESN'T WORK!,"At first i liked it because it met my simple needs-a simple mp3 player that played some songs i like so i dont have to burn a bunch of cds. But, it kept having problems from the getgo. When i put my smartmedia card in, it just froze and the only way to turn it on or off, was to take the card and the battery out before trying it again. Also, it can freze at random times too and i have to take the battery out. You also have to hold the on button for literaly 5 seconds! And it only plays mp3, so i have to downloade free softwear to convert wma or wav to mp3. If this unit just worked how its supposed to it would be good for money, but it doesnt. I mean, the features are pretty good for such a cheap mp3 player but is just that-CHEAP! So right now i curently cant get it to turn on at all, so im gunna try and return it.PLEASE LISTEN AND DONT BUY IT. I DIDNT WHEN OTHERS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND LOOK WHAT HAPPEND!"
1,Comments,I had this mp3 player for about 2 weeks it worked perfectly. Now it wont turn on. WHAT is the problem? What kind of mp3 player stops working after 2 weeks. Dont waste your money.
4,NEED DRIVER,"I love this MP3 player. I am currently looking for the driver to the Ev64amx. I attempted looking online for any available downloads since i broke the CD. If anyone could help me with finding the driver and software, that would be great. email me! spicyshortie21@hotmail.com"
3,driver woes are being solved,i am in process of using drivers i got emailed to me. thanks to everyone who tried to help.
2,I need the XP or win98 drivers too!,It looks nice but I can't use it because I don't have the drivers! If you have them please share them.whitton182@hotmail.com Could you add Evolution drivers to the subject box in the e-mail?Thanks!
2,It breaks,"I loved this tiny, brilliant machine. However, the one I bought broke in the first three months. Radioshack immediately gave me a replacement, but this has stopped turning on, a mere three weeks later."
1,it is so bad,"I bought a new one from ""J&R Music and Computer World "" but it seemd that just like refurbishd one becase there are some fill gold lost in the surface ,that really make me unhappy, and it is said that ""Uses 1 AA Battery (included)"" but I found no battery in the original box ,I am puzzled .The worst thing is that I download some songs but cannot play well-- there are some "".WAV"" files that can play with mp3 player in my computer but cannot play with the ""NOW EVOLUTION EV-64AMX Portable MP3 Music Player "",even bad ,the ""NOW EVOLUTION EV-64AMX Portable MP3 Music Player ""always no responding when play such file and the only thing I can do is drop out the battery to make it power off , it is really so bad.additional,I can not find the ""removable drive "" after Iplug the usb at the second time , I must restart my computer to find them , bad!# NOW EVOLUTION EV-64AMX Portable MP3 Music Player"
3,"interesting, but not a must","This book compares and contrasts the position of German and English as languages of science. While German was frequently used before the war (there were also many German Nobel prizes) after WW2 its use as a scientific langanguage has dramatically declined. Ammon's research suggests that in some parts of the natural sciences, partiuclarly physics and mathematics not even German scientists use German as langauge of publication.In the conclusion, Ammon suggested that German universities should become bilingual - a somewhat misguided view in my oppinion (ESP courses should be enough)."
1,worthless,these sucked and were not worth the cash. I was shocked at how small the can was and the almonds tasted stale!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,not what i expected,I expected a much more flexible and thin clear insert. This like a really cheap picture frame you'd buy at the dollar store.
1,the best service and frame product,"I ordered this product and recieved it two days later for no extra cost. The product is excellent, I use it to display pictures to their full extent without the bulkiness of a frame.Acrylic 8-1/2"" x 11"" U-Shaped Frame"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"Unless you buy tourist guidebooks to read about gratuitious violence, find another book. My husband bought me this book for Christmas 2 yrs ago to help celebrate our decision to adopt a baby girl from China. Reading Christmas morning, expecting an exciting prelude to our next adventure, we got instead a horrific recount via a sidebar about an unspeakable act of violence to a dog somewhere in China. We have shelves in our library filled with travel books and there will never be a lonely planet guide guide among them."
3,Already Out of Date,"Let's face it, China's a big place and changing at the speed of light. I credit this newest edition of LP China for trying to keep up but as a frequent traveler to China, I've been frustrated to no end in seeking the dead-end addresses and recommendations that's listed in this edition. There's so many inaccuracies, it's embarrassing. Previously ""undiscovered"" spots are now teeming with tourists, there's a sorry list of restaurants and most of the ones listed seem to cater to foreigners anyway, making redundant the China experience. I'm usually a big fan of Lonely Planet, but LP books seem increasingly to be chock full of unnecessary and often demeaning commentary towards the local population. Noone can hope to try to understand China, so keep your smarmy opinions out of it, editors! I can buy Paul Theroux for that and have a LP that's lighter in the backpack."
3,Read before you go but don't pack it with you,"China is such a great country both in area and history. I found this relatively small book not as useful as other LP guides for smaller countries or areas. Nearly 1 billion of China's population are farmers and live most of their life in rural, agriculture orient villages. This book just can't cover that part of China well. It might did good enough of covering big cities and modern part of Chinese living but certainly missed out a lot too. You can read this book for getting general information and try to get other LP guides targeting smaller areas. Try LP Southwestern China!commenter lives in a former China ruled island, Taiwan outlying mainland China where now is politically separated from communist China. China and Taiwan both share the traditional Chinese culture."
2,ok after first 250 pages!,"hi! im 14, and have read this book. I didnt read the first, but maybe i will. I agreee this book was VERY slow in the beginning. But after about the first 250 pages or so, it got better. I think I might read the third."
4,It blew me away!,"I couldn't put it down until I hit the end and I couldn't wait for my next visit to this world! This was a great read, if you love cats, telepathy or the interaction of just people and animals you'll love this book!"
4,"Good, but not as good as the first one...","For some reason, Greeno chose to destroy MOST of the main characters -- almost as if she was worried any book without a lot of senseless deaths would be unprintable...The Ghatti are also relatively absent for much of the book, which I found a great disappointment.The plot and characterization are otherwise brilliant... It was nice to see Greeno decide to treat the ""Gleaners"" a little more rationally in this volume than she did in the first. The only problems really occur where Greeno evidently ""needed"" to inject elements that didn't fit in with reality. Still, it's worth the extended read, if only for a historical set-up for the next novels."
5,Excellent,My daughter who is 2 absolutely loves this book - she brings it to us to read over and over - she knows most of the words already!
1,Improper application description,The product description states that it is a charger for a JVC BN-V14U battery among others. A BN-V14U is physically too large to fit into the charger. Improper description resulted in purchasing a charger that is useless for the intended application.
3,Charger,Did not receive all of order. Only got the car charger. It was for my husband and he was not pleased.I was disappointed to say the least.
5,Great customer service,"I am from Brazil and it was awsome to listen the samba, the live music in this CD. It made to feel like home."
1,Made in China,"Red Barn has a plant in China, a country that not only eats dog meat but skins them alive and roasts them alive. I cannot put my trust in a company that manufactures in a country that treats animals in such an inhumane and despicable manner."
4,Interesting and True,"The history of India has always interested me, and more so, when it is written in this way. A story, with many tales,a personal approach to many facts.I enjoyed it very much."
3,"The Last Mughal: The Fall of a Dynasty: Delhi, 1857 ...","I found the Last Mughal a fascinating historical sort of biography and journal about a part of Indian history that we are somewaht aware of but often forget. I especially found the description of changes in British Colonial Rule from participatory to dictetorial fascinating...The strength and weaknesses of both the Indian and British cultures are readily understood and form part of the problems and solutions...However, I found the book lacked critical analysis and was weak on historical methodology...It did not relate what happened to the Delhi to the rest of India or World economics or political changes...Benjamin"
2,"Dalrymple's concern is Islam, not India","Dalrymple is writing less about India than about an Islamic regime that, as a previous reviewer noted, was initially a colonial power ruling over Hindus (often with a brutality that makes the Brits look paternalistic in contrast). Dalrymple has become a commentator on Middle East policy, with a pro-Islamist perspective that has led him to criticize Israel and the United States as well as Great Britain. This does not mean that his history is of no value. His use of ""Persian"" documents to give the Mughal viewpoint is of interest. It is just important to be aware of his leanings and sympathies. His work cannot be considered an objective or disinterested chronicle of facts. He has a partisan-Islamic axe to grind."
5,The Twilight of an Empire,"One of the greatest books ever written about the fall of one empire and the expansion of another.... this narrative relates the story of how a group of traders came about to become the rulers of India through never ending conspiracies and intrigue. This is the story of how the Britishers behaved when they thought the sun would never set on the British Empire. Alas it was almost a little less than ninety years later that the British were forced to leave India... forced not by a civil war, rather a crippled economy... They left India far less prosperous than when they acquired it. In the ninety years of formal British rule, the British Empire plundered and looted India's wealth much like the US would do so almost 150 years later in Iraq.Much can be learnt from the British experience in India by the American Empire."
1,Dalrymple' s biases to the fore,"William Dalrymple has done extensive research on the Indian Mutiny. His biases come to the fore:(exhibited in all his works on India)1> He loves the Mughals, who were a cruel foreign exploitative regime in India2> He is an apologist for Islam (interesting how that has changed off late)One exception :He generally is an apologist for the British occupation & atrocities in India. In this book he is more truthful. However his reviews of Amitav Ghosh's book ""The Sea of Poppies"" is more illustrative of his true feelings.He needs to stop exploiting his ability to live in India and write about it. How about some books on Scotland instead..................?Less exotic and fewer copies sold !!!Move on Dalrymple."
5,Very Satisfied,I found the Opteka 3x Telephoto Lens for Canon PowerShot A95 to be a very nice and high quality lens and the silver adapter and stepping ring that was included with the 3x lens was an unexpected delight. This was money well spent. With regard to the silver adapter it takes the place of Canon's LA-DC52D Lens Adapter and is of better quality!
1,Dissapointed,"Actual lens OK, however the adapter for the Canon A510 is poorly designed and fits loosely. When you screw in the lens onto the adapter, the whole assembly is loose and shakes when you move the camera. I don't recommend this unless you can find a better adapter."
3,Sufficient Stand,"This roller stand fulfills its function but isn't anything special. A side-by-side comparison to the Heavy-Duty Fliptop Roller Stand by Rockler favors the Rockler stand quite a bit. As a light-duty stand constructed of small diameter square tubing, One can adjust the legs for less-than-level floors by spinning the rubber feet. Unfortunately, the round rubber feet attach to square tubes at the bottom unlike round tubing used by other manufacturers. This makes rotating the feet cumbersome. The locking mechanism is located on a corner at a 45 degree angle and appears light duty. It folds up and stores nicely.Amazon sold this unit for $46.53 including shipping as a warehouse deal; it performs like a $30 stand but nothing more. Much better stands available out there. It's staying but cannot be recommended to others looking for a sturdy stand.NOT recommended."
5,Best roller stand out there.,"This stand is extremely stable and is leaps and bounds above the junk you'll find at HD, etc.I would prefer a knob to the t-handle they provide to secure the roller but otherwise I'm very happy.Be careful that your fingers don't get pinched as you extend the legs."
1,Old stock,"These batteries were either junk to begin with, or possible were just OLD. They were weak upon arrival and wouldn't take or hold a charge. They were returned for a refund."
5,I Love Lucy,I Love lucy and I love the Lucy Show! I am a die hard I love Lucy fan and so excited to find out about this series that I didnt know ex-histed! It takes a few episodes to switch gears from I love Lucy to the Lucy show but once u do its easy to Love this series! Its great! Every Lucy fan should see it!
5,The most awaited TV on DVD for me ever!,"At long last, after years of waiting and hoping, this series is finally coming to DVD. Lucy and Viv sparkle and shine in this follow up series and as other reviewers have pointed out, some of their best work is HERE and not just I Love Lucy. I'm hoping all Lucy fans come out and support this release. Anyone who bought the public domain releases and were disappointed needs to give this series another try with season 1. The first three years with Vivian Vance are vastly SUPERIOR to the last three years set in Hollywood, which probably gave many casual viewers a bad impression of Lucy's post-I Love Lucy work. I'm hoping CBS will be shocked by the great sales of this season and immediately work on putting seasons 2 and 3 out promptly! We lifelong fans of Lucy deserve to have all of her work made available to us. :)"
5,LOTS OF FUN!,"The Lucy Show: The Official First Season. If you like ""I Love Lucy"" you will like ""The Lucy Show"" Lucy and Vivian and their Kids getting into all kinds of troubles and Slapstick Situations. 30 Episodes in 4 DVDs with lots of Special Features:New Interview with Lucy ArnazNew Interview with Jimmy GarrettClips from ""Opening Night"" SpecialVintage OpeningsVintage ClosingsCast CommercialsVintage Network PromosFlubsCast BiographiesProduction Notes""The Lucy Show"" Vintage MerchandiseThe Lucy Show The Official First Season is filled with very funny Episodes, lots of laughs, Great DVD transfer as well as Sound, it is in Black and White, however, it is high quality, very clear. In my family, we all enyoy watching the Lucy and Vivian Team all over again! Thank You"
2,I don't think this first season of I love Lucy not to HOT!,"I Love Lucy, Grew up watching The I Love Lucy Shows! and didn't care for any other of the black market one's, Yes Lucy was and is the STAR But The cast that plays on the show with Luck Ball make's the show, And make's it worth watching! Lucy, Ricky and the best friends that are their landlords the tight wads. Now that's the Show that every one (LOVES) and being that, The I Love Lucy Show was first introduced to all of us,In Black & White.Not Color, In my Heart it isn't the same with out it being in Black & White! I still watch it, try to never miss it, If I can't catch it I make sure I record it on DVD. It's on TV every morning, at 8:30 AM. For 30 Min, But was very mad when they changed the time, It us to be on for an Hour every morning from 9-10 AM, now only 30 min makes no since 8:30-9:00 AM, so have to save my money and try to buy all they made, But to make sure the RIGHT CAST is playing in it!"
2,Recycled laughs,"more like 2 1/2 stars. fine actors with weak stories and script. seems like it was all done before. gee, the same writers from 'I Love Lucy'. Lucy does this and Lucy does that. how original.that said the presentation and extras are great.one more thing, Vivian Vance actually saves this season from being a total disaster. She could be the most underrated sidekick in the history of television !hope season 2 is an improvement."
1,Excellent! Best TV Series DVD This Year!,"Definitely do not pass up this one. CBS/Paramount has outdone themselves with this DVD set. Every episode is in perfect condition and uncut. One correction to an earlier review: The Lucy Show was actually being broadcast on RTN (the Retro Television Network) until last year when all the Paramount series were pulled from the network, and then they were only showing the color seasons (Season 2 on), so it's nice to see the black and white ones again after so long. Now let's hope we get to see the color seasons on DVD... The color quality on these was really superb on RTN, so one can only hope."
3,"Excellent review, but ..","I, too, look forward to Season One of the Lucy Show. The first season is the best. They seem to get progressively worse with each passing year. Re the Joan Crawford episode, it can be viewed in its entirety on YouTube. Well, it's been divided into three or four continuous segments, but it's worth checking out. Great fun."
3,Good but Missing cardboard sleeve,The first season good but the series take off when Gale Gordon joins. I have to wonder why Season 1 was missing the cardboard Sleeve as all the other seasons had one. This seems very strange to happen as I read it comes with it.
4,beautiful story with strong female protagonist,"Unlike the usual simpering heroine, Lucia is strong, mysterious, natural, and good. Children who are different from others--foreign, language difficulty, intelligence higher or lower--will appreciate how this stranger bounced back from hurt."
5,Copasetik & Cool - Hill Street Soul,"Very good CD. I purchased this CD for its version of the song ""For the love of you"" which was originally released by the Isley Brothers. I discovered some other nice tracks like Pieces, Blue Tears, and Think Again. I wonder why I wasn't aware of this CD's existence, until I researched a song that was played on a jazz radio station."
4,Copasetik & Cool,Awesome CD - the case was cracked a bit in shipping but the quiality of the CD was just fine. GREAT PURCHASE
2,JUST OKAY,"DON'T GET ME WRONG THE GIRL CAN SING, BUT IT'S JUST NOT WORKING FOR ME, SHES NO INDIA AIRE OR ANGIE STONE AS FAR AS I CAN HEAR."
1,Sorry,Sorry but I'm not impressed. There isn't an original or interesting note in ear shot. Maybe I'll have some dutchie and try again one day when I'm stranded on a desert island and all other cd's I have are warped or broken and I need to listen to something that distracts me while the natives are chasing me through the jungle.
5,"Long Pig, A Fantasy Concerning Cannibals, Courts and Other C","San Franciscans are wierd, San Franciso's politicians are outrageous and San Francisco's legal community challenges credibility...which is to say, ""the City"" is terrific...In Long Pig, San Francisco's multi-cultural melting pot boils over under the stirring of Miller's comedic genius. His account of the bumbling and venial antics of his four mayoral candidates rivals the best of contemporary (or non contemporary, for that matter) humorous fiction...and speaking of fiction, Miller describes his book as such, but I wonder. Everytime I open my Chronicle now I think ""Is Miller imitating life or is life imitating Miller""..Whatever, this book is a hoot! I can't wait to see what other ""Institutions"" Miller will descrate with his insightful and irreverant pen."
3,They're okay.,"I have many hardcover books about 10 to 12 inches tall and this bookends flex a bit when under stress. For shorter books, okay. They are made from about 1/20 inch thick metal, simple and not flashy thus I bought them."
5,Absolutely unmissable!,"There aren't that many amazing books to read in the world. How often do you take a book and find that it lacks that something that keeps you awake at night or makes you wake up early (when you adore sleeping) just to read it? This is not a thriller (which can have the same effect but for different reasons). This is a monster itself, but in the best sense possible. You just can't miss it. For anything."
4,In Good Shape,"I am new in this profession, but seems to be a great resource book for Vet Assistants and Vet Techs."
3,OK Book,"This book is OK but lacks more in depth technical overview of SAP NetWeaver and its components. It has 10 chapters and waits until chapter 9 to dive into some of the technical depth. Much of this depth was so quick that I would not necessarily use the term ""depth"" to describe it. Could have excluded 3 of the 4 business examples as these were more specific to the industry and the individual company. I was looking for more screen shots and more technical specifications and did not find specifically what I was looking for. It had good content for the company looking to implement a totally new IT infrastructure, however for companies that have already started down that path, it fell it bit short."
2,No reason for anyone to buy this book,"I suppose at one time there was a reason for someone to purchase this book, but that is no longer the case. The book _SAP NetWeaver the Official Guide_ contains all of the content you'll find in this book plus more. The Official Guide is the same price as this one. When I say ""contains all the content,"" I mean almost all the text found in this book is reproduced in the Official Guide with only minor elements changed.As a prior reviewer noted, the technical elements in this book are saved until the last 2 chapters and as a result compose a minority of the book. Most of the book is a set of case studies of various hypothetical companies that use NetWeaver.In the event that you value the case studies, they are still present in the Official Guide. In the event you want more technical elements, that facet of the book is greatly expanded in the Official Guide.So, in summary, don't buy this book. Buy the Official Guide instead."
5,a confusion by the reviewers,"This is one of Argerich's greatest recorded performances. The reviewers who talk about the performance being more tame or passive are confused by the microphone placement by the engineers. I like the resonant sound at St. Eustache near Montreal, but I can understand other tastes. Many of Arrau's Phillips recording are miked very closely, and THAT reverse mike placement can cause confusion, too. Argerich is more mature and less sloppy in this recording than her first. That first one, though impetuous, suffered from not such good ensemble, and less than Berlin's best playing. That is my personal opinion.However one views the 2 performances of Prokofiev 3rd, please don't confuse the recorded sound with the playing!The other pieces are new to her recorded rep. and I love them, too. (see her play the Db Prokofiev concerto on DVD. Not a good orchestra, but her pianism is white hot!)"
4,argerich is amazing,"dutiot and argerich make a great team they blend very well together espesily in the 3rd concerto, very well played probeley the best 3rd iv every heard though i havent heard them all,though i still like argerich more when she was young but she still is a yellava pianist though her sound is more modern where as dutiot/montreal sound is more romantic but they still blend well together.decide for your self.i give it 4 stars mostly because of the sound,im glad they got john ducursly from london/label to do the engerniering for emi but the sound is kinda dark and a little blurry but wuy carp buy it for the preformence you wont regret it"
4,"Prokofiev - Piano Concerti 1 & 3 Argerich, Dutoit, Montreal","Once again I broke my never buy Argerich rule, and once again I have paid for it. Dutoit and the Montreal are absolutely superb - clearly worth 5 or more stars. But Argerich. With all of that talent she still feels that she must rewrite the compositions of the greats. One moment she's superb, the next she's off wandering to a different drummer (no insult to the drummer - I mean the one in her head that has to rewrite everything.) I give her a 1 for the wandering a a 5 for the highlights. That's a 3 for Argerich and a 5 for Dutoit and the Montreal. Average score - 4She really should form a jazz ensemble - then she could improvise to her heart's content.."
4,Amazing Game,"This is currently my favorite. The game play is intense, much better than Halo3, the scenery and story have been very well researched. Congrats to all involved in making this game."
3,"Fair game,, but not lot of functionality,,","Can't adjust the skill of your opponent, plus you can't be on the other side,, 1 person play only. The aim is too sensitive for me as well, no way to adjust that."
3,Okay but...,I was used to the newer versions of this named product which is fantastic with the adding of DICE and FROSTBITE2 technology. It may be okay for someone just starting out but still the newer versions are so much better.
4,$99.99 ?????,"Huh ????...$100 for this game...something must be wrong because i just bought it new for $20, is someone asleep in the pricing or info systems dept? what a joke."
1,Waste of time and money!!,The guys who developed this game did not do their research of the effectiveness of the different weapons. Since when is the 9mm more powerful than the .45 ACP? Since when can anyone be so good with a Rocket Launcher that they can hit you right between the eyes while you were sprinting?You can shoot a German with a .30-06 at point blank range and they keep going. Enemy soldiers magically appear to kill you from places that you've just cleared. You can't use the MG42's sights - whn you are allowed to use it at all.This game is a waste of time and money. I am never going to buy another EA game ever!!
5,Best WWII game,I enjoyed playing this game better than any other WWII game on the xbox 360. Highly recommended! I still like this better than all the new games that have come out.
3,Could have been better,"I bought this recently and although it has a few good things i don't like the game too much because it is frustratingThe graphics are good but not great,the level design is confusing because you can take different routes and can achieve the objectives in any order.The ai in this game is quite smart,unlike some of the other ww2 games i have played which is kinda nice,the hit detection in this game is off,it is frustrating when you are shooting at an enemy soldier and he wont go down right away, but in the meantime you are getting blasted by other enemy soldiers.I think if EA would have spent a little more time on this to address certain issues it would have been a better game.I have played both the call of duty games and the earlier medal of honor games and none managed to piss me off like this game.Whoever said that this game is better than Call of duty world at war is sadly mistaken, world at war is a hell of alot better than this."
3,"Good or Bad, WW2 Never Dies","The 360 showcases wonderful lighting and intense firefights in MOHA. Unlike last gen WW2 titles in which programmers used lots of tricks to make it seem like a big battle, MOHA has large levels and lots of enemies, so that after parachuting in you'll turn into a human meat-grinder, shredding Krauts in two with your BAR. The sounds also bring the experience home: explosions, rifle fire, soldiers screaming, and soaring music to pump you up. MOHA's good, not great, but good. EA definitely should turn to a new venue in its series, but MOHA is a good exit."
4,Better Than COD 4,"I havent been a fan of MOH or COD games for years, since they did millions of sequels and nothing new.Airborne offers superb graphics and something really cool. You basically jump out of a plane and choose where to go and what mission you want to complete. Plus there are weapons skills that go up. The weapons and sounds are realistic, and it offers online play but i dont got my xbox 360 hooked up to internet. Animation is also amazing, gives lots of life.Not too many missions but they do last a while if u try to raise all your skills on the weapon systems they have and do an airdrop at certain hidden points to get achievements.COD4 on the other hand has better graphics but it so fake and straight forward. But there is a plot. Weapons fire like BB guns. Not a fan."
3,warfare,"this is another call of duty 2 wannabe but, fail in the try . this title is even worse with the graphics it seen like I'm playing my regular xbox . online play is funny. but not fun as call of duty 2 and 3 or another warfare game as the ghost recong 2 or R. six vegas. SORRY BUT THIS IS A DISSAPOINTING GAME.FOR A WARFARE OR FPS GAME. NOT RECOMENDED"
3,good game. stupid achievements.,"this game, just like all of the other moh series are great and fun to play. there is a decent amount of replay value in xbox live and going through to beat it in all the difficulty levels and unlocking achievements but there are some buggy parts in the game that are annoying as hell. for example, when you need to land on a skill jump, some skills jumps require you to land in an exact spot otherwise you won't get it. (i had to land on a pillar for a skill jump and i did but didn't get it until i landed on a certain corner at a certain angle, which i found out on youtube). but besides the achievements and such, the run, iron sights, etc are great and fun to play with. graphics are decent, not overly amazing like other fps games on the xbox360 and the mechanics aren't as realistic as i expected but still fun to play. the ai can be stupid sometimes, getting stuck on corners or running in circles which is hilarious. wished there was a co-op option to this game."
1,save points are horrendous !!!!,"I've been playing the game a few days now - but one thing made me post this 1 star review right now - I just spent about 20minutes battling and moving my way up, but there werent' any save points - after 20 minutes of battle, I got killed and........ARE YOU KIDDING ME, I STARTED AT THE CHECKPOINT FROM 20MINUTES AGO AND HAVE TO REDO ALL OF THAT ?! 1 star."
3,Okay game,"the sky-diving part is pretty damn cool, but just the controls and story-line are just to sub par."
3,AIRBORNE,"the game arrived very quickly....it has great graphics and its awesome jumping into drop zones, but, when you are trying to fly through the level, its very hard to spot your enemy, the friend and foes dress the same..."
1,My mistake....,"My mistake, I thought it was Yo Yo Ma's choices in the music that he played....not by others. Did not like the CD at all."
3,"Interesting, but repetitive","Anothony Smith's book traces the lives of many early inventors, including: Gatling, Colt, Maxim, Lewis and Browning (among others). It also traces the usage of the guns and the mindset different countries from the Civil War to the modern era, with emphasis on the colonial wars of the 19th century to World War I.My main complaint about this book is the repetitve nature of many observations. We understand that the British/French mindset at the outset of WWI was that machine guns were not for use in civilized warfare, must we read this observation a dozen times?"
4,A Five and a Three at the same time,"Murray Rothbard was a friend of mine, with whom I had many engaging conversations. His historical knowledge was second to none. His ability to discuss controversial topics with people who disagreed with him, while never crossing the line to make it anything other than an intellectual question, was unparalleled.That said, the first seven chapters of this book are an amazing historical look at banking. While there is still history to be gained in the remaining chapters, between chapter 7 and chapter 8 you are required to take a leap of faith across a grand canyon of philosophy because the book switches from being completely history to trying to integrate a specific economic theory (Austrian) into the history. If you are willing to make that leap, or willing to put up with that part to gain Murray's wisdom on the economic history, this book is worth the read."
1,Cheap reprint DO NOT BUY,"LikeAmerica's Great Depression, this is a low-quality reprint that has no TOC or index. The typography for the headings is laughably amateur, low-resolution graphs, etc. Use the Search Inside feature to see for yourself. Compare with the PDF of the book as found on Mises.org.Was Amazon fooled into stocking this vanity press edition?"
5,Must Read,"If Americans had a better understanding of the mechanics of banking, as articulated in this fine book, America would definitely not be in the suicidally disastrous economic/fiscal shape it is in. It also furthers the case for maximum LIBERTY in all areas of human life--especially when it comes to money and banking."
1,Kindle version of the book is awful!,"Beware. They did a really poor job with the kindle version of the book. The layout is awful, pages are often repeated, pictures are missing, some random text appears in the middle of the paragraphs etc. Seems like somebody just run pdf through automatic pdf to mobi conversion utility and didn't even bother to check the result. Even though it is only 4 bucks, I'd really like to get a refund on this one, it's a matter of principle, if you are selling books in electronic form that cost you nothing, at least have the decency to make it readable."
4,Judge Yourself,"The CD is good. It switches from live performances to tracks accompanied by 'mood' music. Personally, I prefer the live or acapella tracks because Acey often speaks with a high level of energy. That energy coupled with intellectually stimulating speech makes for good work with every release. My favorites on this particular CD; Judge Yourself, God's Work & Metaphysix"

2,Always liked these books till.......................,"These books have always been a fun read, like the writer, as well as the writing.Something went wrong with this one, however.Josie has a boyfriend whose former girlfriend is found murdered in his NYC condo.Josie wants to find the murderer, forget the entire NYC police force is seaching for the one who 'dun' it.Josie sets out on a mission to find the killer- how does she do it ? By going to every spa/salon/trendy shop in NYC- that's how.We come to quickly forget that she is asking questions at the time- we no longer care. She leaves no stone unturned either. We hear about every fabric in every dress she looks at , as well as procedures done at all the fancy spa/salons. Like a travel brochure with the hint of a mystery- which is never delivered to the reader. Sorry, the book was lacking."
3,A Pigeon in the City,"I enjoyed Josie's view of New York. And amateur detectives always get involved whatever the local P.D. is doing, so I can't fault that as another reviewer did."
2,Liked these until.............,"These books have always been a fun read, like the writer, as well as the writing.Something went wrong with this one, however.Josie has a boyfriend whose former girlfriend is found murdered in his NYC condo.Josie wants to find the murderer, forget the entire NYC police force is seaching for the one who 'dun' it.Josie sets out on a mission to find the killer- how does she do it ?

2,A Fashionable Murder,"First Valerie Wolzien book that just wasn't that good! Josie does not belong in New York not doing construction work! The plot seemed really scattered and not very organized to me (won is so very important but only in the very beginning and ending of the story, finding of dead body didn't seem to matter at all) - book just wasn't up to Valerie's normal high standers! Plus I could care less about fashions, beauty salons and all the crap Josie was finding in NY! ""Just ugh"" for a review!"
5,Way better than crutches...RollerAid,"Product is exacly what they say it is, and that is Awesome!I have had foot and ankle surgery several times and my hands cannot take the crutches for any length of time. I was really surprised when my doctor suggested renting a knee walker. I had never heard of or seen one. I did my homework and found this fabulous knee walker on Amazon for much less than anywhere else. I feel it's the best one rolling along. I still need the crutches for transfer around stairs, but around the house, the yard and out shopping it's a breeze. I just love it's ease use and easy to travel with. It can be to big for smaller trunks without completely folding it up, it will fit in the back seat of most sedans.I am going to be using the RollerAid for over two months. It was money well spent."
4,A wonderful blast from the past!,"I read this book in the 90's and absolutely loved it, it was quite fun to read it again all these years later. She is a very funny author and there are several laugh out lout moments. Its a bit of a fluff chicklit read but there's also, surprisingly, some really good writing in there. Also rather fun to be reminded of the world before cellphones, facebook or instant messaging!!"
3,A bit weak,"There's a malevolent presence in Sea Haven and the Drake sisters need all of their collective power to combat it. Matt Granite, a former Army Ranger and a native of Safe Haven, fell for Kate Drake long ago but has never expressed his feelings. Now in the face of evil, the two are thrown together.While I enjoyed the premise of the story, the dialogue was weak and the writing often repetitious. The offered conflict between Kate and Matt didn't make sense but their romantic scenes were more interesting.I'm hoping the next book in the series improves. There is tremendous potential in the sisters' gifts for storylines but so far it hasn't materialized. There should be more than them all being spent after each use of their talents and the subsequent mindless banter."
2,Witches in California,"Frankly, I bought this book on the basis of a reader review and I was somewhat disappointed. It is the story of one of seven witch sisters, living in a seacoast town in California and amusing for a couple of empty hours, but I found the supernatural elements predictable and the romance at Harlequin level."
4,Awesome!! Must HAVE!!!,This is an awesome series. Very HOT!! A great addition for Christine Feehan-aholics!!
3,"Good, but predicitable..","Based on Christine Feehan's other books, this one fell right into step. It's a great read, but predictable and usual. Read this one if you are a Feehan fan. If you are new to Feehan read one of the later Drake Sister novels."
2,Pretty bad writing!,"I thought this book was stupid, to put it bluntly. The mist that takes material form so that it can throw things because it hates Christmas? The relationship between Matt and Kate? Two people who have lived years apart on different continents and did not even attend school together? They were never friends that I could detect from the storyline. Yet, each KNEW the other was the only one for them. What utter tripe. Maybe the man in the mist is more believable than the love story, now that I consider it farther. A stinker of a book.For the record, I read and enjoyed the Hannah story! That made this all the more disappointing to me."
1,The Twilight Before Christmas Book,"Was charged for this book but never received it. Therefore, the only thing I can say is obviously, since I did not receive it but was charged for it, my review would not be favorable."
2,Predictable and blah,"I agree with the reviewer who said this is an obvious set up for a new series. I really enjoyed most of her other Dark series books. Though there was one or two that I found a bit slow. This one is no way compares to her other books. Non of the caracters are developed, even the main couple. I felt like her publishing date was coming fast and she had to get it done. I had to force myself to keep reading. There was none of the dark mystery or thrill of the caparthian men. I gave this book 2 stars just because there is real potential for the series. But do not bother with this one unless you are one of those people who has to read them all. Otherwise skip it and see if the next in the series is any better."
3,OKay reading,"This wasnt my favourite book of the series, it was rather out there. Not her normal line of story so i suppose it was okay but not as riveting."
5,Another great read,"I can't say it enough. The stories, all of them, are exciting and wonderful. They each have such wonderful modern heroes & heroines. Thank you Ms Feehan for your gifted works."
3,ok book,Im trying to finish to read it but its moving kinda of slow for me. I love this authors other works but this story isnt moving quickly enough for me.
5,Another winner for Christine Feehan,I first discovered Christine Feehan with her Dark series which I loved more with each successive book. This series by Ms Feehan looks great from the start.I loved this book. Kate is such a gentle soul and I think most women could relate to her.I hope the rest of the series is as good as this one!
3,The Twilight Before Christmas,"I enjoyed this story, but I wanted more of a plot of WHY this was happening to the small town during the holidays"
4,Excellent Value!,"Wireless networking is the coolest thing ever! After minimum configuration of the WAP I was sitting at my dining room table, wirelessly connected to the Internet with my laptop. I installed the WAP configuration utility on the desktop in my basement (running WindowsXP Pro), and got the same error as one of the other reviewers: this software only supported on NT, blah, blah, blah. But yet the utility actually did install, and worked perfectly, so I don't know what his problem was. Besides which, all configuration is done through a web browser anyway, and they give you the default IP in the manual.If it weren't for the glitch in the software install I would have given this product five stars. Regardless though, this is still the best value for the money of any 802.11a access point on the market today."
2,Meh...,"Definitely NOT T. Anastasio's best effort. Listening is sometimes challenging. ""Shine"" was much better. Sounds like it was recorded live with a little beer thrown in... lacks musical craftsmanship."
5,the bare truth about philmore,this is a great cd i went to there concert and talked to the band in a little town called frankenmuth michigan well anyways there were great and i was able to get one of the first copies of the bare truth about philmore when it was just a demo. i have to say that it is one of my most listen to albums. they lyrics are great and the music is great. it is a must have.
1,WHERE IS JESUS????????????????????????????!,"I bought this CD known that Philmore will never change. I WAS VERY WRONG! The first CD was awesome. It had every ounce of Jesus, from dating to life. This CD is very disappionting. There is not one line or word about christianity. It went from allowing God to direct him to his girlfriend, to how to get one buy been 'cool.' I will not listen to this CD again. I pray they find God in their music again!"
3,Not likely to wake the dead,"Every ten years or so, when the dearth of great German composers becomes too hard to bear, record companies trot out Franz Schmidt's The Book With Seven Seals, a grand oratorio based on the Book of Revelations. As far as scale and ambition goes, there's no arguing against this work, even though it's about as dated as a stuffed auk. With each new recording a few converts are made -- mostly among those who either love church or churchy music -- but to my ears this is banal stuff. Schmidt had an apocalyptic subject but worked in a cozy Sunday parlor style: think Elgar without the genius. There's no insight into the text and barely a memorable tune; the idiom is pre-brahms at best. I suppose Welser-Most's version is as good as any. The tenor soloist who sings the part of John strains considerably, but so do his rivals. I can't imagine wasting much time over this drearily devout farrago."
2,Hair Lady,"These clippers stink! I lost the #3 extension on my Wahl clippers, so I bought these thinking Oster is an AWESOME brand ... their profession line is great, but this product is a piece of junk. It shreds the hair instead of cutting it and it pulls like crazy on any kind of hair (fine, medium, course)."
2,below average critical review,I didn't read the book but was listening to the audio book. i'd hope the book is better than the audio. I didn't wish to finish with it. I really got nothing worthwile out of it.The only thing i could gather was the imnmigration of the family during the war years and the marriages and dowrys and business partner brothers and the internal fighting throughout the family. Was kinda a real headache to listen too.Not reccommended
4,An interesting read for people working in the investment banking world,"Well written, detailed, lots of anedoctes on Lazard but not only Lazard. It is a big book (650 pages) but easy to read and at times even captivating. Very interesting for people that have experience/exposure to the investment banking world, maybe less so for others."
5,Long but worth it,"extremely long, but it gives you a great description of how an organization rises and falls with the times and the great men who are at the wheel."
1,Just gossip,"Nothing at all of substance, just a lot of unattributed and unsubstantiated gossip about i-bankers, People magazine level."
1,"all fluff, no meat",Am about halfway through it and it's more like a popcorn soap opera recounting little petty jealousies. It recounts a few big name deals they firm facilitated with virtually no real deal details. The secret history it ain't.
2,Boring read,"In my personal opinion, the book doesn't flow easily like the book Barbarians at the Gate. This book gets boring after it puts the reader through lots of small details."
4,Tasty,"I stumbled on this album looking for stuff that John Giblin (Kate Bush, Brand X, Peter Gabriel) had played bass on. I was intrigued by the cast of characters who appear on the album--in addition to Giblin, also appearing are Trey Gunn (King Crimson), David Rhodes (Peter Gabriel), Peter Hammill (Van Der Graaf Generator) and world musicians Kudsi Erguner on ney and Shankar on double violin. I decided to take the plunge and was richly rewarded for my efforts. With a revolving cast of vocalists, we get washed in tones that remind me of the best of Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel. If I have any complaint, it's that the CD runs a mere 37 minutes."
3,The Art of Hyperbole,"I think Trump is a phony and an egomaniac. But I gave him credit for ""coming back."" But he doesn't really elaborate on his comeback nearly to the extent the title suggests. So I was disappointed in that. I'm from L.A. where even the average burger-flipper runs into celebrities with frequency, so his name dropping of celebrites meant nothing to me. I really would have liked a more introspective analysis of his comeback, but didn't find it here. He's an overgrown boy, which is no sin, but also doesn't make for great reading. One thing he says that a very very wealthy friend of mine told me is to ""not depend on one source of income."" So that's decent advice. Too bad more wasn't included."
3,"While this book was interesting, Donald is very egotistical","This was the first Donald Trump book I have ever read. I started the book with wild enthusiasim expecting to learn something new that I could apply to my own life. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. This book was full of self-proclaiming victories for ""The Donald"" and did not contain much applicable to everyday life. ""The Donald"" is at a level in life that is well above the normal everday person and therefore it is hard to relate to his experiences."
5,THE WORLD'S GREATEST SALESMAN TALKS AGAIN,"The guy lays out his financial comeback. But, the real point of the book is an entertaining display of upbeat publicity and cheer he has brought to New York. Over the years he's been a one man Marshall Plan for the City."
3,Uncover The Hidden Treasures,"For the reader able to plow through the egotistical language of the author (any great businessman must be somewhat egotistical to make him great), there are several worthwhile lessons for the aspiring entreprenuer. As the best of his three books, the volume also provides an entertaining account for the casual reader."
1,self-serving aggrandizment from a pompous egoist!,"The first (and LAST) book I will ever consider by this egotistical maniac. I had assumed that there would be some relavance in here (a la ""Jack Welch Speaks), but no, only how cool The Donald is.Save your money."
2,The Art of Donald Trump's Accomplishments,"This book fails to live up to its title ""The Art of the Comeback."" Having devoting only one full chapter on how he came back from near bankruptcy, Donald Trump fails to give his audience a proper perspective on the ingredients of coming back. His theme, like his other two books, is basically about all his acquisitions. If you truly are looking for a book about the inside secrets of negotiations, business practices, and real estate finance, don't buy this book. Instead, try to get his first book ""The Art of the Deal."" Now, that's a book you can learn a thing or two from."
4,Another 200+ pages of chest pounding from The Donald,"I have long been a fan of Donald Trump. I have read every book available on him, including this newest one. This book gives a little insight to his inner workings, and some of his deals. The biggest disappointment for me is that Donald will not share any of his vast financial acumen with us. He is very gifted in the arena of finance, and I wish that he would impart some of that knowledge on us. Perhaps he feels like this would give away some of his business advantage, or maybe he just likes chest pounding better that education. In contrast, Warren Buffet spends lots of time telling us the exact formulas and philosophies that he has used to become a billionaire from the stock market. Donald Trump has a great gift, and I wish he would write one more book to share even a portion of that with us."
3,What a guy!,"Trump knew exactly what we'd say after we read the book. He's egotistical and he's egotistical. But, he gets to talk about what he wants -- his sucesses -- and he gets to take a jab (or a full swing) at everyone who's irked him. Between him and his ghost-writer, he's even able to sound gracious and sincere while doing so.You may not get much real estate developer knowledge out of this one, but you'll come away thinking that Trump is an innocent victim. He's an innocent victim who is also the savior of New York (Hell -- all of the East Coast) and the world's premier developer. He helps everyone and provides advice to anyone in a position of influence. Alas, he is still but a victim to press and even to those who he tries to help.They'll all learn someday...!"
3,Back in business,"Like all the Trump books this one captures a moment in the life of ""The Donald"". Trump's bad habit of erroneously naming his books with 'how to' titles makes no exception here as The Art of the Comeback contains no instructional material. The book begins with Trump taking shots at some of his rivals, whom he feels betrayed. The book puts Donald back in the drivers seat, officially letting everyone know 'The Donald' has return and is richer and more powerful than ever! Flaming aside Donald briefly talks about his divorce with Ivana, and I mean briefly, there is no indication as to why Donald thinks the relationship collapsed, expect for a few nonscientific remarks. Anyone interested in the life of New York City's real estate tycoon would identify with this book, those looking for actual advice on making a financial comeback are better set skipping this one."
2,Quit while you're ahead,"This book should be called ""The Art of Looking Like An Arrogant Moron."" Although there may be brief passages of note concerning Trump's comeback (a legitimate topic of interest--when you happen to find one), most of the book is just a 'Damn, I am a god' thing. If you remember Jerry Lewis' character Johhny Love, you get the idea. A chapter on his women? Puh-leeze! Trump says it is his last book. Do us all a favor and keep your word. The man who wrote Art of the Deal would be ashamed of this book."
1,My most disappointing book this year,"Donald said:""This is my last book"". It could have easily save that one. The reading of the book was a complete waste of time and money. Not a good ""deal"" for the reader. Donald's next book could be ""The Art of Falling Down Again"". Donald shall focus on what he does the best: building (great) and womenining (beautiful)"

3,"Good Keyboard, Bad Mouse","This cordless desktop has a good keyboard, but the battery life on the mouse is appalling. It lasted hardly a month before it needed to be replaced. The battery on the keyboard, however, seems to go on forever."
2,Not Happy With This Item,"This keyboard has small keys and doesn't stand up enough. It worked fine but I wasn't comfortable with it. The legs that make it stand are not high enough and I don't like typing with a flat keyboard. Didn't like the feel of the keys either. Like I said, it worked just fine with no problems but the feel of it wasn't what I wanted. Just not happy with it."
4,A good value for a cordless setup,"I've been a big fan of Logitech keyboards, mice/trackballs for years. I've been using this cordless setup with a notebook PC at work all day every day for 3 months and it hasn't had a hiccup yet. It has performed very well, but I must say that the mouse feels a bit clunky compared to the other Logitech mice that I've used. (I did buy the least expensive Logitech cordless kb/mouse combos that I could find to use at work, so I'm sure that my cheapness is the main problem!). Although the mouse ""feels"" a bit clunky when clicking, it works perfectly. So far I haven't needed to change batteries yet, after 3 months of use 40+ hours per week."
1,disappointed with the mouse,"Though I like the keyboard, I've found two serious problems with the mouse. First, it is very sensitive to movement. I've tried making some adjustments but it is still difficult to control. Finally and more importantly, the mouse burns a set of AA batteries about every 8 days. I only use the mouse about 6 hours a week so I should be getting a lot more battery life. I've bought other Logitech products and have been pleased with them but in this case I wish I had bought another brand."
1,Not a good choice,I bought this product for use in my office. In less than two months I have changed the batteries in the keyboard 5 times and once in the mouse. I also had problems with the keyboard in regards to connecting to the receiver. The keyboard would often lose the connection and needed to be set-up again. Good price but buyer beware...You get what you pay for...I am now going to return this product and try out the Microsfot Elite Office wireless duo.
4,This is the second one I have had to order,"from Amazon. The first one was missing a plug-in for the keyboard. Although the one I have now works just fine, the whole process of ordering, returning and ordering again was not worth the wait. I would have been better off buying one from a local electronics store.I love this set, though. It works just as well as the higher-priced cordless desktop sets out there."
1,Connection would have been nice,"I had all kinds of problem using this thing. All I wanted was the keyboard, but it didn't like my logitech wireless trackball. I ended up having to plug it into the keyboard port using a ps2 adapter (supplied). It worked for about 20 days. Now it won't connect, or when it does it disconnects within minutes. I've changed the batteries and tried usb ports again, and nothing.I'll liked logitech wireless keyboards before but this has been a bitter experience. Now I'm back to el-cheapo wired keyboard."
1,"Very Cheap and ""Plasticy""","This has to be the worst keyboard I've purchased. It's my first wireless. I've used and sold several keyboards and none have fealt as cheap as this.With the added snap-on plastic palm rest it sets the base up too high. Without it there is a 'hump' where your palms go that puts your hands an an uncomfortable angle.The plastic is really bad. It feels really cheap and slick.Before I purchased this I had been trying to get in tough with Logitech about their products and compatability but they never bothered to respond.So, bad product....company on the slide.....doesn't add up to a good value.Logitech used to be the best company out there...or at least one of the best...."
2,Punch compared to 3d architect,"As an occasisonal user with little experience, Punch is much more difficult than 3d home. The walls dont self square, window and door choices are extremely ,limited and you have very few closet door choices. I gave up and went to a new version of 3d home. 3d is much more intuitive and a heck of lot faster. I can see why Punch was discontinued."
1,Bad Product,I bought this new and the DVD's are messed up. They freeze and are blurry. I am not happy. I had to stop watching them.
5,Where is Season 2???,"Excellent TV series from the mid eighties. Now I can finally watch some of the episodes that never have been shown on German TV.But how much longer do we all have to wait for season 2?It's quite a while now since season 1 has been released and according to the other reviewers there is enough demand for the 2nd season and the 3rd and 4th season as well!PS: It's December 2011 now and more than two years later the second season from ""Hotel"" is still not out. Why???"
4,Includes Pilot with BETTE DAVIS,"I am writing this review only to mention that the original pilot starring Bette Davis is included, but her presence is not mentioned anywhere in the set, not on the back, or inside with the guest stars. Ok she is not a guest star because she was supposed to be a permanent role but you would think someone could have added her name on the packaging? I only bought this for her :)"
5,Hotel Tv series,I liked it..where are the other seasons? I am eagerly awaiting them.. please dont keep me hanging too longtnks
5,Don't Stop Now!!!,It was great to see this series again! Please don't stop now... I am anticipating the release of all the seasons!Nicely done! Holding on for the next season!Debbie
5,super!,They are fantastic! They pop open like discribed! It is worth the money! They are neatly stacked in the box.
5,VHI therapeutic ball kit,I wish more cards were available in VHI series. It allows me to keep the exercises I use on file for my clients.
3,Swish is better,"Flash MX is a very good, detailed Flash making software. But it is also very advanced. For those of you with less than perfect flash making abilities, i recommend a program called ""Swish"". It's cheaper, and much much easier to use."
3,Macro media flash,It is an extremly useful product wihich I would immensly reccomend BUT the price is extremly high so it is impossible for normal people to have.
4,Great program with great options though worth the moeny?,"For huge designers this may be a program for you. Otherwise I'd suggest Macromedia Flash 5. Cheaper, more user friendly, easier options, and easier to do actual animations. I am a flash specialist and I can work with Flash MX well. Though overall if I am doing long animations or splash pages I'd well vote for Flash 5 to do my dirty work. They are both great programs that will completely help you with your animating career!"
4,Great Show but no original theme,This show is in my top ten favorite of all time. I purchased the instant amazon version because its available faster to me and the only complaint I have is that in the instant version they don't have the theme song over the opening credits. The theme song sets a tone for the show and it jarring that it's a different generic song.
5,satisfied in the Southland,"Oh man do I love amazon instant season pass subscriptions for watching tv. If you love love a show, but can't stand ads, and don't watch enough to justify a dvr, then for a small amount you buy the pass. Then you can watch it whenever you want, as many times as you want, on many devices. And at the end of the season you own the whole season forever in your video library. Amazon has already figured out tv, why wait for Apple TV?And it's Southland!"
2,"OK for about a year , short life span","UPDATED: I bought two of these, they performed pretty well for about a year and then both experienced failed cells. I guess I got what I paid for, low cost=low quality. My original dewalt batteries lasted almost 10 years, these TopCell completely failed in less than 2 years; they do not work at all and overheat if attempt to charge them.ORIGINAL: I was very impressed with the price of these batteries. They have good capacity and fit in my dewalt perfectly. I've had two of them for a year now and they are starting to drop off in capacity. I haven't really found any other reasonable replacement batteries for my 12v dewalt until I came across these TopCell packs, no regrets here."
4,"Works great, visually unappealing","I would give this battery 4.5 stars if I could. It works great and now that I know how strong my drill can be I will buy another one soon. The only knock I have of this battery is that it has the visual appeal of the old black and white ""generic"" product labels from the '80s."
2,Disappointing,I bought this battery to replace a DeWalt battery that had died after several years of use. This battery worked OK for one summer of house remodeling but never had the battery life that my standard (non-XRP) DeWalt batteries had and required more frequent charging. After a year this battery needs replacement as it loses its charge unless I keep it on the charger and it does not work very long before it needs recharging. Meanwhile one of my two original DeWalt batteries is still working fine after nearly five years.
2,Not so great after a year.,Maybe it's because I don't use it all that often but the charge dosen't seem to hold as good as it did when I bought it a year ago. The Dewalt batteries that came with the drill lasted several years. The battery is still useable but I wouldn't count on it for a bigger job.
1,Dissapointment,"Seriously. Can anyone ever read this?! The girls in here have there own language ""any hoo I pleez"". It's reedeekulus, Galleria would say. The girls in here are shallow, fashion-obsessed people who almost hats eachother. I wouldn't recomend this. What I recomend: Warriors Harry Potter"
2,Worked great for a little while then quit!,"Product worked great for a little while then just quit. SMC tech support was of no use because the product was at it's end of shelf life so no support was available. When product was working I give it 4 to 5 stars, but when because of the lack of support, even after paying for support at $29.95 and still getting no where, I can't recommend this as being a good by."
4,Had Linksys--This is a better unit,I had the equivalent Linksys unit for a couple of years but it began powering down randomly so I had to replace it.This unit has many more firewall features and offers finer controls on the LAN/WAN settings--much more than the Linksys. My only complaints so far are with the DHCP server: there is little control over leases and no way to specify a WINS server address. On the Linksys you could call up the current lease table and remove items if you wished. This unit only has a running log of leases.The SMC is also much more solid. Steel case. Reset button on front. Only uses a line AC cable. The Linksys has a laptop-style supply that became flakey after multiple resets (which involved unplugging the power from the cheap plastic unit).
2,The most silent of all movies!,"Given the fact that this film has no soundtrack, I can only give it two stars. It is a bit too silent to enjoy."
5,Memories come back,"I can't believe it. I have not heard Gene Pitney sing recentley. WHAT A SURPRISE, and a happy one. His voice has not changed. In fact it has gotten better. As soon as I heard that voice all my memories(happy ones), came back to me. I highly recommend this cd and now am going to buy other recent ones. I hope he comes to Chicago soon I will be in the front row."
5,"Accomplishing a personal goal, step-by-step>","Being a person that loves the outdoors and adventure, I found that this book captured one man's quest for that same spirit. This story draws you into the trail step by step. The reason for developing the Appalachian Trail is more than justified in these pages. It set standards for hiking and Pat Pittard met that goal. This book will make your feet hurt, your back burn and your heart yearn for the next turn in the trail."
1,you meet all types.........,"you meet all types of people on the on the trail but this is one arrogant SOB! he constantly flaunts his life's business successes, and money, but then shows what a wuss he is by whining about some stupid dog he misses at home. not a purist, he slack-packs and blue blazes the trail to boot! why do the trail if your not going to do the true trail? i wasted my money on this one folks....this guys story is weak at best!"
5,Ideal for Wood floors,I've used this product for several years. It's wonderful for wood floors; so easy to use. It really revitalizes the look of the wood without a waxy build up.
2,Not Impressed,"I bought this because I could not find Pro Shot floor restorer. I was very disappointed. I have oak and mahogany wood floors and this stuff gives the wood a cloudy look. It does work well on vinyl though. Fortunately I just found Pro Shot again, and would recommend you try it instead of this stuff."
1,Waste of money.,I would not recommend this product. It is a waste of money. It made my floors look worse than ever! It made them look hazy and just awful.
4,Tap-Dancing is STILL great Jimmie!,"This is actually Jimmie's second release while he was alive. One can sense his determination for some type of commercial sucess while remaining true to his new found fans and himself. The album as a whole comes out feeling a little bit unfocused. He simply tries too many things for one release. In the minds of the record execs, this one should push his career further, but in many ways it was an initial set back until ""Dragon is Dancing"" came out. This album DOES contain several of Jimmie's best. Streets Of The Harbor, Keeper Of The Canyon, Moon On The Water all have Jimmie's true magic. Buy it for these three tunes and for history. Great spin!"
3,"Not his best, in my opinion, but a good CD nonetheless","Buy it to round out your collection, for sure. This being Jimmie's third CD, I think he might well have been working too hard and too fast.Still, ""Original Tap Dancing Kid"" is fun. ""Shirt full of Apples"" is probably the best song in the collection. Even the worst are worthy of a listen."
1,Incomplete episode.,"I purchased this episode not noticing that the Amazon product details note the episode length as 16 minutes, when the actual episode when aired on Showtime was 30 minutes long. The on demand episode stops at 15 minutes and 40 seconds, in the middle of a segment, in the middle of someone's sentence. The comedian Mike Birbiglia who is said to appear in the episode never appears in the 15 minutes and 40 seconds of footage. Until the problem is corrected and the whole 30 minute episode is made available I would recommend against purchasing this product."
2,Sadly this went downhill,"Basically, season 2 is plagued by the same lack of care in making the DVD as season 1 was, but the content itself is also not nearly as good. Don't get me wrong, its still better than almost anything else on TV, just not up to the high standard that season 1 set."
2,"Pathfinder, The","Limp effort to present one of James Fennimore Cooper's Leather Stocking Tales. It has none of the pacing, drama, realism or tension of another of Cooper's tales on film, ""Last of the Mohicans"", with Daniel Day Lewis. The music alone sets ""Mohicans"" apart. Don't bother with this film."
4,James Fenimore Cooper,This is a story taking place in my favorite era of american history and therefor I would like to give 5 star. I deduct 1 star coz of missing Uncas in the story.
3,This is not Ofelas,"The review by quiet traveller is NOT of this movie, it's of a movie called Ofelas, translated as Pathfinder in its US release. This movie is based on a James Fenimore Cooper story about the Americas during the French and Indian wars. (Ignore the star rating, because I haven't actually watched this movie yet. I ordered it thinking it was Ofelas - which, it turns out, isn't available on DVD, at least not in the US.)"
5,PERFECT!,We bought this item to match the rest of our Butterfly Garden collection and are very very happy with it! It was very inexpensive and came with two large panels. The colors or vibrant and the designs are great! We can't wait for our little girl to get here so she came enjoy it too! :o)
3,Fan noisy after 18 months... no replacement parts,"MB works perfect with my AMD Athlon 64x2, until two weeks ago that started an annoying sound... checked and clean... add oil in the little MOBO fan and everything worked perfect for just 15 days and again the noise.Actually I don't care much about changing parts... I like it. THE BIG PROBLEM is.... Cannot find easily a replacement!!!!!!. You cannot install a Universal fan so easy... it should have the wire that measure de RPM to be MB BIOS compatible !!!! The space is so small...... Only have TWO pilar type attachment bolts. Thinking about change completely this MB.No replacement parts... No deal.... sorry MSI"
2,Mine was Defect,Can't say much about the motherboard because he was defect.So i returned it to amazon.
2,Valuable info in utter disarray,"Although ""The Food-Mood-Body Connection"" teems with interesting information, its format robs it of instructive value. It takes the form of a long series of interviews with alternative-health practitioners, with occasional (and I mean occasional: more than half the book is paragraphs quoted verbatim) comments from the ""author,"" Gary Null. If such a style appeals to you, you'll love this book; if you prefer knowledge in a usable context, however, turn elsewhere.With real editing, this may become a valuable resource. Until then, most would be better served with Elizabeth Somer's ""Food & Mood,"" a truly useful guide to this important subject."
5,THE FOOD MOOD CONNECTION BY GARRY NULL,GREAT BOOK! JUST WHAT I NEEDED WITH SOME MEDICAL PROBLEMS THATI'M HAVING. THIS BOOK HAS REALLY HELPED ME WITH SOME CONDITIONSTHAT I DO NOT NEED A DOCTOR FOR.
3,Kind of average,"I have come to expect a lot from some groups, the Isaacs included; however, thought this album was only kind of average. In that respect a bit of a let down."
5,FABULOUS SELLER,I PURCHASED THIS VIDEO FOR A BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY FATHER. HE LOVED IT. IT WAS SHIPPED OUT QUICKLY. I RECEIVED IT IN NO TIME. THANKS AGAIN FOR MAKING THIS A GREAT BIRTHDAY FOR MY FATHER. I WOULD DEFINETLY ORDER AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER. THANKS DEANNA
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD,"THIS IS A HORRIBLE FILM. It is only 8 minutes long, with a monotone, boring person narrating. It is insulting and pointless. I showed it in class and afterwards a student said, ""I learned absolutely nothing from that."" WHY have an 8 minute long film with no point and no conclusions?"
1,Poor quality=sad little girl,"When we received the truck and trailer the top looked broken, but we opened it anyway. It was in fact broken and the plastic truck and trailer are very poor quality. Not at all worth the price! I would NOT recommend purchasing the Breyer Stablemates Truck and Trailer."
1,"""The Siege""",This is definitely a miss book. Dated material that does not stand the test of time. This work does not compare to the rest of his work.
4,Not Easy-Breezy-But Very Powerful,"This book deeply impressed me, but it's definitely not for just anyone. Its blunt examination and critique of human nature will only appeal to the most serious and dedicated seekers of truth and enlightenment . I liked the author's subtly inclusive and self-deprecating approach. That tempered its somewhat scathing directness.It's an intense metaphysical guide to human behavior, sociology, and spirituality. In addition to its' intense original insight, it also incorporates discussion of mysticism, quantum physics, and great literary (lots of Shakespearean references) and philosophical quotes. Pretty heady stuff, if you can relate to it. Definitely highly recommended for anyone truly and sincerely seeking enlightenment- of any kind!"
5,POP,"Ace of base has made some history in pop music. This is first single from their third album (listeners in the States were treated with ""Whenever you're near me"" - slightly different melody, new lyrics).""Life is a flower"" is just like a flower - it's blooming :) It has a very positive vibe, perfect summer tune.The track list is as follows:- original version- reggae version (the beat is more similar to their first hits such as ""All that she wants"" - cool!)- extended version (longer intro, everybody loves EXTENDED VERSIONS!)- soul poets night club mix (house mix with a very strong bass; completely different to original)- ""No good lover"" (never released song, typical Ace of base track, resambles a bit ""He decides"")My overall impression of this maxi single is very positive. Not only for fans."
3,Typical Ace of Base Sound,"LIFE IS A FLOWER was one of the group's biggest hits, charting instantly throughout Europe back in 1998. In retrospect, the song does capture the true Ace of Base essence of happiness, perkiness and sheer bubbliness. While this is not one of my favorites of all their songs, this record is undoubtedly excellent in terms of vocals, instrumentals and production values. I think that I would like this song better if I had not been introduced to the unfortunate version released here in the U.S. entitled WHENEVER YOU'RE NEAR ME. I heard this lacking version a long time before I ever heard the true Euro-version. LIFE IS A FLOWER is good song, and while not quite measuring up to other Ace of Base hits, maintains itself via pure pop energy."
5,One of their best,"This is a first European release from Ace of Base's 3rd album (titled ""Flowers"" in Europe; ""Cruel Summer in USA). It was one of their biggest hits, ranking up there together with their such as ""The Sign"" and ""Beautiful Life."" It's a beautifully composed tune, featuring mesmerizing harmonies. Beautiful song, very catchy and very 90's. It's a nice single to add to any CD collection."
2,Disappointed!,"This game is so poorly constructed that the pieces that are supposed to ""slide"" get stuck constantly. The board folds in a way that the crease never goes away, even when it is supposedly lying flat. My four-year-old (who regularly plays games that are for 8+) can't get the pieces to slide- I have to help his every move. It takes a LOT of the fun out of it, for both of us! Overall- a good concept (I am considering purchasing the card version) but a flawed design. Would NOT recommend."
5,Excellent Book Highly Recommended,"This is a wonderful book, very well written. Author is very talented and by reading this book you can easily tell alot of research was done. I would highly recommend this book to everyone."
5,Finally . . .,"I first saw 10,000 Maniacs performing their Peace Train video on MTV and became an instant fan - and immediately bought In My Tribe. Much to my dismay, although Peace Train was listed on the CD jacket and in the lyrics section, it wasn't on the CD itself! I assumed there was some copyright issue and figured I'd have to be content with the rest of their great music.Some 17 years (wow) later - I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it listed as one of the songs in Disc 2. WOO-HOO!!!Disc 1 is a good selection from their other albums - good for the car while keeping the other CDs in the house. The real reason to buy this is for Disc 2. A must have for any 10kM or Natalie Merchant fan."
5,Excellent!,"Still, kind of dissapointed. Where are ""don't go back to rockville"", ""Jolene"" (the studio version) and Jackson Browne's ""these days""?"
3,Okay Album,"If you don't own any of their stuff - a good compilation. Even with the second disc, if you had collected the singles, you're not getting a lot for your money."
5,Smart Music,"If you are a conversationalist with an open mind, this one is for you. It is smart pop/rock. It is cool music. It will educate you if you know someone with a drinking problem or give an overview on child abuse."
3,Too much praise...,"10,000 Maniacs deserve to have a comprehensive compilation, but sadly, this is not the compilation it could have been. To all of its defenders, yes, it DOES have its moments, but why omit two of, not only the best on their sadly ignored ""The Wishing Chair"", but two of their best, period, ""Can't Ignore the Train"" and ""Grey Victory""? I realize this isn't a ""greatest hits"" kind of compilation, and 10,000 Maniacs was pretty much only played on college radio and received a bit of exposure on MTV (when MTV even played videos), but it really peeves me to no end when an artist's best songs are dismissed like this, especially when those two aforementioned songs are not available in remastered sound, as the rest of this compilation are (the original album CD's have crappy sound) AND when labels decide to include demos or live versions instead of important studio versions. As I mentioned, the improved sound on this disc(s) is a bonus but, as I said, it could have been much, much better."
3,Rather predictable,"Whoever chose the tracks for this collection made a hugely grievous error in including one sole track from the Maniacs' best album ""The Wishing Chair"". Choosing the best-known tracks rather than choosing the best tracks makes sense from a sales perspective but as a prior reviewer has stated already, The Wishing Chair is criminally overlooked and has many gems on it.The many cover versions on this collection are rather by-the-book and leave one wondering why they didn't pen more of their own B-sides."
3,Good,You need to like this band to appreciate the entire album. Besides to two popular songs the music gets a little muddy.
4,Not sure what to say,"Great band but this is not much more than a greatest hits album. It's great that the second disc collects the band's non-album tracks, but I'm not sure if it's worth buying the whole album for that.Also, it's somewhat ironic that the release is called Campfire Songs, yet the song ""A Campfire Song"" is nowhere to be found."
3,caught my ear,"nice intro of instrumental sound, blended with the vocals, but wishing for more variety. still a nice listening for wishing to just be laid back and relaxing for the afternoon."
2,Precious Time by Euphoria,"I really love the 1st song (Precious Time) and song # 6 is ok, but not really crazy about the rest of the music on this CD. Euphoria should do a CD with 13 songs in the same vane as Precious Time. I think that is the name of track #1.ThanksLori SherrillSalisbury, NC"
4,Death is a matter of delicacy for Frenchmen.,"Realised by (mostly) French artists, this CD can boast of having the most adequate singers for the the roles. Michel Plasson conducts his orchestra with precision, being discreet when needed for this opera √† voix. Natalie Dessay is Lakm√© evidently, her colorature voice covering the necessary high-pitched notes with ease, which enables her to concentrate on the drama. The Flower duet's beauty is covered with an ominous atmosphere (Lakm√© will commit suicide through a flower after all). As for men, Van Dam's diction, and its dramatic force, is well-known. He can also be so sensitive: ""Lakm√©, tes yeux se voilent"" gives a full display of his love. Kunde is technically adequate, having no problem with his character. A slight reproach though, we don't get the impression he is in love with Lakm√© (which he is supposed to be at first) as if he would run away at the first opportunity."
2,nice but too much crooning,they all sing for the mic and sound vocally tight and at times I cant even hear them. Van Dam is wonderful. This is a perf. for the studio only could not be heard in the opera house
4,Very good,"Slon manages to balance jazz improvisation with electronics very nicely. Some of the improvisation is done with electronics, and sometimes the electronics is used to enhance the song. There are a few songs where there is too much synthesizer (Zagreb, Kite, Palermo), and not enough cornet, bass & drums. Some songs instead of acoustic drums have (obviously played, not programmed) bleeps and squaks driving the beat. Theres a free-ness to Rob Mazurak's playing, but there are no lack of themes and written-out parts. On the whole, it's a fresh-sounding, excellent jazz album."
4,Everything I expected,"The presentation and quality are good. Easy to follow instructions on the disc and presentation format of episodes just as I remember from when I watched the TV series at home 33 years ago. Maybe my memory is not that good but the quality seems a little less 'clear' and the colour not as vivid, but maybe it's because now the quality we expect is so much better.(Thus not 5 stars). Otherwise as I said in the title 'everything I expected'."
5,My husband loves them!,Bought them as a gift for my husband and he can't stop watching them! The quality is very good and I recommend them.
4,Alias Smith & Jones - Season One,"I loved the Alias Smith and Jones series when I was young. This DVD brings back alot of memories. But I don't remember the pilot, so that addition is a big plus for me. Alot of the scenes were filmed in areas I knew as a kid, so it is always fun to watch these old westerns. If you like westerns and comedy, this would be a good purchase for you."
5,Alias Smith & Jones,I was so pleased to find this TV show on DVD. The episodes are witty and engaging. The actors fit the roles perfectly. A good piece of television history.
5,"Ah, my teenage heartthrobs!","Yes, every Wednesday night when I was a teenager, I tuned in to ""Alias Smith and Jones"". Now, thanks to the modern miracle of DVD, I can visit them all over again. I hadn't seen this show in over 30 years so when the box set came, I was transported back to teenage nirvana. I'm hoping this sells enough copies that Universal warrents the release of the next 2 seasons. This is what good television as all about; good writing, good actors, good direction and AN ORIGINAL IDEA (something lacking in TV these days). This show still holds up after 30 years."
4,Episode: Never Trust an Honest Man,"When you watch this episode ""Never Trust an Honest Man"" you will notice toward the end of the episode they will go up to this old house. And it may look familier to you and it should. It is the house fromthe original Psycho movie. I could not beleive it."
5,Alias Smith & Jones - Season One,I bought this as a present for my husband who regularly talked about watching the show when it was originally on tv. He was delighted with it and actually watched it in a couple of nights. He said it was every bit as good as he remembered and he is now waiting impatiently for another series to be released.
4,ALIAS SMITH AND JONES,"NICE TOUNGUE-IN-CHEEK APPROACH TO THIS WESTERN SERIES. VIOLENCE IS KEPT TO A MINIMUM AS THE TWO ""EX-OUTLAWS"" AVOID CONFLICT IN ORDER TO ATTAIN AMNESTY."
4,FUN n GUNS,"The premise for Alias Smith is what if Butch and Sundace were offered amnesty if they could stay out of trouble for say, a year,(which is based on fact) an original an innovative idea for a western which that is exploited to great affect by Glen Larson and his team.Sadly we lost Pete Duel whose charisma was the focal point for the show, Ben Murphy being the restraining influence.Alias Smith and Jones belongs to genre of action feel good shows.I avidly await season 2"
3,Author's other books are better,"This book does not begin to measure up to the author's earlier book, The Magic of Crazy Quilting (which is stunning and admittedly a tough act to follow!) While the Magic of Crazy Quilting is jam-packed with techniques, stitch instructions and contains only a few quilts this book contains a variety of quilts and other projects with suggestions for piecing them but no instructions for specific embroidery stitches etc.It does discuss a variety of ways of doing piecing for crazy quilting. The variety of projects give alternative colour schemes etc. but none are particularly inspirational.This is a good book to borrow from the library or to purchase at a discount clearance price. However, I would not pay full price for it."
2,Not my Cup of Tea,"There are crazy quilts, and there are CRAZY QUILTS. I guess I'm going to sound like a snob, but I like crazy quilts that have some thought behind them to the structure and flow of the design, to the color palette used and the style and placement of any embellishment. The quilts in this book looked thrown together willy-nilly and left me feeling that I was looking at someone's scrap heap. The pleasure I find in crazy quilts is taking those scraps and transforming them into a pleasing whole that is much more than the sum of its parts. I had high hopes for this book, and maybe if I could look past the kind of quilting used and imagine the quilts that I prefer in the examples of decor given, I might still find it useful."
5,A nice personal firewall,This is nice personal firewall. I enjoy its compact design andnever occupy much of the system resources. It's I/O speed is alsovery nice and won't delay much the network traffic.
3,McAfee Firewall false alarms,McAfee firewall puts out its fair share of false alarms.I would recommend Tiny Software Personal Firewall over this product.
4,Once again a well-played and poignant role...,"As usual, Robin Williams shows us what being 'connected' to life is about...being unafraid to reach out and share those times of joy and laughter, grief and sorrow, and the full range of all things in between.Cast performances were well balanced and thoughtful. Again, giving the viewer a gentle reminder of the true meaning of humanity."
1,Not kid friendly,"My daughter (8yrs. old) received this machine as a Christmas present. My husband and I spent two hrs. trying to get the machine to work properly. The problem was with the bobbin. We could never get it to thread correctly and then once we did the bottom stiches were very sloppy, loose, and tangled. I would not recommend this machine. A child would never be able to string the bobbin correctly."
1,Children Sewing Machine do not purchase,"My daughter wanted a Sewing Machine for her 8th Birthday. I thought it would be a good introduction to sewing instead of using my adult machine, but it was a mistake because the Singer Lockstitch Sewing Machine only worked once, when we first tried and this was it. I tried to work on it but it is so cheaply made that no wonder it doesn't work more than once. Unfortunatelly by the time we realize, I could not return it, because the box was in the garbagge.It is just a big waste of money. Don't buy it."
2,Disappointing Product,"I purchased this machine for my eight year old neice who loved to used my full size sewing machine. The intent for giving her this machine was to give her a kid-sized machine designed for children that would allow her her to practice and learn how to sew in her own. She loved the design and colors of the machine. However, it was very difficult to thread the needle as the presser foot ""protectors"" were in the way. She could never thread it and required an adult. The bobbin kept binding up. I tried everything to get the machine to work, but all attempts failed. Overall for being a kids machine, it is the right size but the quality is only okay. In the end, I decided to get a smaller full-sized ""real"" machine for her to use, as it was more reliable."
1,Worst machine ever!,"I wish I could give this product review ""zero stars."" Do not buy this item. It is poorly designed and poorly built!! Don't the designers and manufacturers test thier products?!? I'm going to write a nasty letter to Singer."
2,The bobbin will jam,"The other reviewer is right. The bobbin gets loose and jams. Mine even broke. I've emailed Singer and asked for a new bobbin case. Hopefully, they'll do the right thing. My six-year-old did make 1 thing, and the controls are easy to figure out. Threading is just as difficult as a grown-up machine."
1,Do not waste you money!,"All my daughter wanted for her birthday was a sewing machine so I got her this one, She started making her baby doll an outfit and it was all going well when suddenly it started making the string into clumps......i recommend not buying this item because i couldn't fix it for my life."
4,a work for all seasons,"Although this excellent piece of work is more suited to Lovecraft's fans or people with some background on his work, it serves equally well the interests of newcomers into the subject.I shall just point out the utmost care and respect for the Master's original work, the passion and scholarship pervading every single line of the encyclopedia.I did not grade it with a fully deserved 5 stars,though....because only the Deep Ones are perfect..."
3,"good quality, no lock","Good quality. Has a magnetic side which spins as tape moves out. Supposed to use your thumb to hold the tape out. This works for quick measurement and the tape is wider that typical small measuring tapes, but no lock makes this less usefull. Can't lay on the ground without it rolling up."
5,Perfect,Small size is perfect for keeping in my pocket when I enter stores with measurements to double check - perfect
4,Great Little tape!,This is a handy little tape measure that fits well in your pocket. I keep a tape in my pocket and this one fits just right.
3,Be careful,"The item shown on the Amazon website is only USB 1.1 compatible. The product description says it is USB 2.0 compatible. If you click on the ""See ...other views"" link, you will see a picture of a different model, which is probably the newer USB 2.0 model. Amazon charged me return shipping to send the older model back."
1,USB 1.1,This device is USB 1.1The SMC website summary is wrong too. You need the SMC2209 for USB2.0. The initial SMC product listing is correct.SMC2208USB/ETHEZ Connect(tm) USB 10/100 Ethernet AdapterCompact USB to 10/100 Ethernet AdapterSMC2209USB/ETHEZ Connect(tm) USB 10/100 Ethernet AdapterCompact USB 2.0 to 10/100 Ethernet Adapter
2,Thorough but Obtuse,"First, let me say that I read only the first half of this book. I was very interested in the topic and the author has done very in-depth research to support the book. Having said that, I quit half-way through the book when I finally got tired of trying to decipher his train of thought. Virtually every sentence is a convolution of clauses and ideas that wind on endlessly so that I finally lost the gist of what he was trying to say. The author often reaches for an abstruse term when a simple word will do. I must have looked up fifty words in the first 100 pages. I also agree with another reviewer that Beatty gets lost in the details and loses continuity on the larger themes.I think the message that Beatty is trying to deliver is very relevant in today's world of economic greed gone awry. I just wish his writing had been more approachable."
3,Economic history,"This probably rates higher than 3 stars if you are an economic historian. It is a detailed dislogue of the years between 1865 and 1900. It is not an easy read, but for the student of the era it is about as complete a recitation as you would ever hope to find and should prove useful. For the average reader however it is not an easy read, is not told in a narrative manner and three stars may be too many. It may tell you more than you ever wanted to know."
2,"Interesting, full of facts, too hard to read","I was really interested in this book and have enjoyed listening to Mr. Beatty on NPR radio as a commentator. But I found his book to be a hard read, even hard to skim. It drifts away from the big picture and wanders endlessly in microscopic details that overwhelmed me. He's seemed more enamored with tricky sentence structure - I some times had to read a sentence several times to sort out all of the heavily comma'd parenthetical expressions. The endless references were useless. In today's age of electronics and hyperlinks a book like this would be much better if it wasn't on paper."
2,Uneven Economic History,"Other reviewers are spot on. This book is very uneven. For a work that covers a fascinating time period and a fascinating subject, it could have been stronger and better written throughout."
2,A Disappointment,"Vaillant's book, from any expository writing standpoint, is poor. He also doesn't address, let alone explain, the psychological/psychodynamic aspect of drinking, which was beyond his purview but exactly what I was interested in."
2,Misinformation,"This book, as well as many out there, encourage people who have IBS to consume whole grain. Whole grains vary dramatically. In this book it lumps it together. I have been following the diet created by Heather Van Vorous in her book ""Eating for IBS"" and she specifially tells no whole grain wheat. As a result of her diet, my symptoms are far less. I can always tell when I eat something I am not supposed to....including whole wheat."
2,it's ok!!!,"This book has more recipies in it then helpful hints about ibs. I would not advise this book if suffering from ibs, unless you are just looking for a cook book. But the sellar was great got it here on time!! I would buy from them again.."
5,IBS Information,This is an excellent book for anyone who has suffered with IBS. I read another book that didn't really have as much information.
1,"I would love to review this, but never received it","I have been anxiously awaiting delivery of this book from one of the book vendors listed on Amazon. My book was shipped December 23 and here it is January 3 and still no book. Anyone with IBS knows that every single day can be agony so having to wait this long for this book is doubly irritating. In this day and age, I can't think of a single reason for a book shipment to take this long. I will never, ever order from an outside vendor again. People tell me this is a great book, wish i could give a personal review, but can't."
3,Good book if it's not the only one you read.,This book focuses too much on just fiber and not enough on the difference between soluble and insoluble fiber. Insoluble fiber and even a low-fat meal can be a deadly combination for an IBS sufferer. The recipes that the author considers invaluable for an IBS diet contain fat that is far in excess of what I could tolerate. I have a master's degree in nutrition and have also studied food chemistry and baking properties. There are other alternatives to the relativly high-fat and high insoluble fiber that this author recommends.
3,"same ole, same ole","I read two books on IBS today. One, Good Food for Bad Stomachs by Dr. Henry Janowitz was excellent. Tell Me What To Eat was just another book that tells us to eat more bran -- which is often exactly the wrong thing to do if you have IBS - diarrhea and is often not the right thing to do if you have alternating constipation and diarrhea. And, there is only token coverage of IBS - diarrhea.There really is a need for accurate information from a registered dietician on IBS. Unfortunately, this isn't it."
1,Same useless information,"I am so tired of reading IBS books that promise to help and don't deliver. The book had the standard ""eat bran"" and ""keep a food diary"" advice that my doctor gave. This doesn't help me. I also don't want recipes for hamburgers and alfredo sauce when I KNOW that high fat foods make me sick. The author claims she has IBS but if she eats the way this book suggests I doubt it. I didn't learn anything new or helpful for controlling my symptoms."
2,Totally contridictory information,"On page 40 she states, ""55% of patients reported that bran made their IBH worse and yet the 1st recipe in ""20 Recipe You Cannot Live Without"" is Raisin Bran Muffins! Whereas in the definitive book on IBS ""Eating for IBS"" says stay away from whole wheat, milk, cheese, and red meat (which I followed and it solved our IBS problem), this book pushes whole wheat, whole milk, eggs, and dairy.""Eating for IBS"" helped. Following the recipes in this book would not."
1,Don't order from this book seller Email no good either,"I never received this book. The email address you said to contact if there were any trouble, did not work. AOL informed me that it was not a legitimate address. Get rid of this book seller! I called to have a credit returned and that was done by Amazon."
4,way too abridged,This two cassette audiobook read by the playwright was far too abridged and just whetted my appetite to read the entire book.
1,Tedious and Disappointing,"For such a well regarded playwright, I found the writing tedious. Miller's comments on the times added nothing that one familiar with the post-WWI period would not already know.I had hoped to learn more about the author's character and inner thoughts, but was disappointed. At times, what came across as irrelevant commentary or details seemed intended almost to obscure rather than reveal.By 50 pages, I was exasperated and starting to skim, shaking my head in wonderment at those with the patience to wade through all 600 pages of this.About the only interesting parts were Miller's comments on his plays and some of their underlying themes or motivations."
3,Beauty and the Beast in reverse.,"I loved the story, but I could not get past the picture Ms. Dodd kept painting of Jane. She was not very likeable. First of all she was described as large and unattractive. Her personality was that of a 50 year old woman, when indeed she was only 27. I found nothing to attract Ransom to her other than her fasination with sculpting his body. His loyalty to her troubled me. He informed on her, yet he married her. What a way to begin a marriage. I don't know maybe its just me, but these two did not have good chemistry between them.I like the fantasy of a beautiful heroin and a handsome hero. If I want reality I'll stick with life. I like to lose my self in the world of my novels. This book left me with a difficult time picturing the characters."
3,Just OK.,"This is my second Dodd book. I thoroughly hated the first one I read, so I was hesitant to read another. I decided to give her another chance and was not moved much in either direction.I'll give it this much: That Scandalous Evening was readable. It was like a cup of diet popcorn, slightly palatable but empty and forgettable. I noticed that Dodds male characters tend to be mysogynistic and arrogant. Unfortunately this makes them not in the least bit likable. I'm not sure I know why she does this since her female characters are always strong women with plenty of self-confidence and intelligence.I might read another of her books once the taste of this one has dissipated, but I won't be going out of my way to do so."
4,Delightful !,What a delightful read. This was my first Christina Dodd book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Her witty reparte between the characters made the story fly by. I couldn't put it down. Thank you for a good time.
3,Not her best,"I thought the book was ok. Really good in parts, dragged in others. I'm glad I read some of her other books though because they are really good."
1,Not worth anyone's time.,"This book is a *pathetic* attempt at romance. The characters, the plot...absolutely nothing about the book even remotely captured my interest. I was so bored I didn't even read the whole thing...just skipped around. I am so never going to read another book by Dodd. The only other one I read, Someday My Prince, was terrible as well. Save your money and time and don't get this book."
3,'That Scandalous Evening' was not very scandalous!,"No, it was not very scandalous, but yes, it was enjoyable. Different, not quite refreshing, but yes, different! The heroine was older than your average 17 - 20 year old debutante and artistically talented. Not only was she talented, but she was intelligent. If you're looking for something substantially different than your average (non-historical) romance novel, try Christina Dodd"
4,Nice book,I won't write a long review because oyu know what the story is by reading the above. I liked it and I read alot of books.
4,Fabulous,"Jane has a gift with clay and in her first season, she falls for Blackburn and decides to model him. Unfortunately, being an innocent school-room miss, she misses some 'vital' detail and when the statue is exposed by a malicious rival, both Jane and Blackburn are in shame.. but of course, for different reasons!! Years later, Jane is chaperoning her niece to town when their paths cross one more time and the story begins...This is NOT your everyday Regency story, so don't expect to be bored or to go through the pages looking for the 'juicy' parts. The whole book is 'juicy parts' and Christina Dodd will never allow you to flip through a page without reading every word in it!Excellent reading, different, original, and very-well written."
3,Something missing,"Having just finished re-reading this book, I can't help feeling that there is something missing from the story. Miss Jane Higgbothem worshiped Lord Blackburn during her first disasterous season. The action in ths story centers around their interactions when they meet again years later. What seemed missing was more detail/explanation about the two characters feelings for each other. I wasn't really sure why Miss Higgbothem felt so strongly about Lord Blackburn, or whether he felt anything for her or was just using her as a distraction for his other activities.The secondary characters were the saving point of the story for me. The scenes involving Blackburn's sister and those with Miss Higgbothem's niece were delightful and fun."
2,Took forever to read!,"You know, I really hate to say, I don't like a book by a fellow Texan...But I just didn't like the book....So there you go...The characters were not warm and fuzzy, hard to get to know. I would almost say empty of feeling.....I think the end of the book was the best part...not saying it to be mean...it really was a pretty good ending...I needed reading material for a lot of hospital sitting, and this one took everything, just to get through it. Was good enough to keep reading, you know, like one of those movies, you watch in the wee hours of the morning..and its just awful, but for some reason you keep watching it, mesmerized, and it haunts you for the whole week, in your tired brain.But you never watch it again, and you keep wondering, why did you keep watching it."
4,Great transaction!,The Short Prose Reader with Student Access to CatalystThis is a power seller! Problem-free transaction with fast shipment. I hope to do business with you again; this seller is highly recommended.
5,Russo Puts Out a Top Notch Show,"Halloween Havoc is, without a doubt, the best event of WCW's calendar year. They always try to make Starrcade #1, but havoc always takes the cake. 1999 was no exception.This was the first PPV show I ever ordered, so i was excited as it came on the air, and the opening bell sounded. First I was treated to Disco Inferno vs. Lash LeRoux for an excellent opening bout. From there I saw many entertaining matches as well as Dean malenko turning on Chris Benoit.The real excitement came towards the end when we saw the Flair/DDP strap match, the Hogan/Vicious brawl, and finally Sting vs. a Mystery opponent!The event was far superior to any other WCW event I have seen. The strap match is unbelieveable, as is the unpredictable ending.Definitely worth renting. If you've seen it, make the judgment on wether or not to buy it."
3,havoc 99,"there was only 1 match that i thought was good ,that was ddp v ric flair,sid v goldberg was dumb."
1,skirmish red white and blue,"The information in this book is not correct, the roster of the unit is not complete. I did not realize it was written by Edward Daily who has been proven not to have been in the unit or a prisoner of war and did not recive any of the metals that he stated."
5,Great Jack,This is a great jack and meets all my needs. The shipment came on time and I am pleased with the whole the deal.
5,I was stunned!,"I was stunned when I read in the introduction that Mr. Busselle had gotten to the point in his career where he wasn't taking shots because he'd felt that he had already taken many similar shots!This intrigued me, so I bought the book.Straight off I realized that this isn't a book about taking photos with a digital camera, but rather a book about the revolution that computers have brought to the artistic endeavor of photography! Mr. Busselle embraces this revolution with a passion and discusses some of the myriad of possibilities in the digital imaging world.The book is well written and filled with examples. I'd suggest a strong working knowledge of Photoshop if you plan on purchasing this book."
3,Misleading title,"If you are looking for a book that will teach you how to take creative shots with your digital camera, this is not the book for you. The photographs are very beautiful, but 99% of them were taken on film. The author discusses scanning the photos after they have been developed and manipulating them on the computer. At the very end of the book the author discusses his views on digital cameras; he doesn't appear to like them and would rather use film. That is fine, but then why call your book, Creative Digital Photography? Why not just Creative Photography? I had hoped to learn more about digital camera techniques but came away from this book empty-handed."
5,Down to Earth Language and Concepts,I took a class with this book as the instructional manual. I found it very easy to understand and follow. Language was basic and it really helped to improve my skills and my understanding of some of the concepts that seemed complicated to me before. This is a great at home/work resource book and I highly recommend it.
3,Good overview of Office 97,"I have used this book in two computer classes I have taken. I found it to be very useful in teaching me the basics of all the Office 97 programs but it was a bit simplistic at times. They showed you how to do things so many different times that it got tiring. Also, I found the section on Outlook to be very poor. This book was good and I did learn a lot from it but I think it could have been a lot better."
1,This is a terrible book!,This is a terrible book! Unless you are _extremely_ slow at learning the inane detail is maddening.
4,My first introduction to Balzac,"I have been going through the classics lately and decided to give Balzac a try. Pere Goriot is considered one of his most important works. Overall, it was a good novel, but it didn't impact me like many of the other classics that I have read.It did paint a vivid picture of the early 19th century French aristocracy that was far from flattering. The title character has a distorted view of love but the law student does have some redeeming qualities. Balzac does a good job describing things, but I found his characters hard to like.Since this is the only version of Pere Goriot that I have read, it is hard to make a judgment call on the translation, but if I read it again I will try a different translation. Some of the phrases could have been translated better and sounded almost too literal.The book was worth reading, if only to get a feel for that time period in France. I came away from it very grateful that I wasn't born an aristocrat in 19th century France."
2,Cheap gasket,Do not use the gasket that comes with this intake. I have had 2 leak in less than 2 years of installing them. The intake is probably OK. Some say they warp. I looked at the supplied gasket and they are cheap. Both failed the same way. Buy a name brand gasket and use it. ATP has a better intake out now. I have used 2 so far and no problems. I use after market gaskets now to be sure. All these products are made in china or other over seas places. I wont trust the gaskets they come with ever again.
3,"Great Kit, One Problem","Great kit that addresses major areas of concern related to EGR passage hot gasses warping intakes. Includes all necessary gaskets to perform the replacement.I would have gave 5 stars but I had a problem with the tubes inside (a separate piece of the assembly, basically air passages to each cylinder) not lining up with the gasket well. I spent almost and hour pushing, pulling, and forcing the tubes to line up and I'm not confident that it did indeed line up after installation. I don't know if this will cause any problems or not, it will likely just leak air into the intake runners bypassing the tubes, but the OE part that came off the engine lined up perfectly."
3,poor finish quality,"This fixed the problem on my old 97 Pontiac and it was quite a bit cheaper than the same product locally, BUT I don't expect to have to use a razor knife to trim off left over plastic from the molding process like I was putting together a model plane or car. Just finished putting it on tonight, so we'll see how long it lasts."
4,Almost perfect product,"I used this on a 1998 Pontiac Grand Prix, fit great, update to the ERG tube was great, only problems were that the fuel injector o-rings were not correct for my car, I had to pull my fuel rail and injectors back out after some serious vacuum leaks around the injectors. Switched to some Fel Pro ES 70599 O-rings and all was good."
4,GM 3.8 Dorman Upper Intake,Be sure to install the throttle body on the bench. The studs will strip out and you cannot get to the back side to hold them on the engine. I think Dorman needs to rethink the way the nutzerts are installed. Otherwise a great product at a good price.
5,Fantastic book about drug use and its potentials as well as its pitfalls,"This book is a great look into the culture of LSD users before the drug become a nation-wide phenomenon. When the drug first caught on for recreational use, people were hoping to use it as a gateway to a new way of understanding existence and reality. Think Aldous Huxley and The Doors of Perception. Of course, this does not happen, and there are many painful experiences to go along with the fantastic revelations and insights that result from using LSD. I myself have not used the drug but after reading this, I understand why one would, but I also understand why I don't want to. The book is told from the point of view of a discombobulated narrator/author, yet he has more philosophical/existensial credibility than the hippie culture that followed in his footsteps with the drug. I highly recommend this to anyone trying to understand more about psychadelic drug use and what it may have to offer, both good and bad."
4,When red is the right color.,"I bought a 0.9mm Pentel Twist-erase Automatic Pencil and the Red Refill Lead at the same time. I put some red lead in the barrel with the black lead, but I am mostly using the red lead. I don't write delicately, so I must keep the lead extended really short so it doesn't break, but that's working out okay. For my purposes, a softer lead that may be more erasable would be better, but it may break more easily, so I am happy with it. I might suggest that if someone is using red ink because it can't be erased, that they might be interested in using this type of red lead, because it doesn't erase either, and it may be another option for art."
1,This book is terrible!,The book does not match with the drawings that are included. It has a lot of type-Os. It's very difficult to understand.
3,this was smaller than i expected,i guess i just wasnt paying attention. but it was a lot smaller than i thought it was going to be. was a gift. still a pretty drawing tho
4,Well done,"I thought this book was engaging. After a couple of sittings, I had this book done. The basic theme to this book goes along with what you'd expect, alcoholism is a disease which needs to be dealt with. I don't recall all the people's names in the book, however the only people you really need to focus on is Buff and his father.The whole idea of the book is how alcoholism destroys families and breaks down relationships. It made for a very fast paced book indeed.If this book had flaws, I didn't pick up on them. The book had me drawn in."
3,The book was very interesting and moving,"I thought that this book was moving because it showed how alcohol can affect people's lives. Buff and his father drank too much, and it practically ruined their lives. The father was always picking on Buff for not doing things that he liked. They would get into fist fights, and Buff would try to solve his problems by drinking. But the drinking didn't solve his problems, it made them worse. It just gave him more problems to deal with. But after reading this book, I will think twice about drinking on a regular basis."
4,just in time,"was a little surprised it took two weeks to ship this from DE to philly. Got it the day I was giving it as a gift, whew, juat in time!"
4,It was a outstanding book,It shows real life problems.I think this would be a great book for alcoholics.
4,Steve's Review,This book is a great example for athletes in highschool or anyone else.Drinking does not solve problems.It only makes them worse. Everyone can learn something from this book.The story shows a real life situation that could happen everyday.It's also good to see how close of a friendship the characters had.
3,its an ok book,"The Boy Who Drank To Much is a exciting book and it tells how much drinking can effect your life,and other family memebers that you love and care about. Buff gets into drinking with is father, and his father is an alcoholic and if his father doesnt get what he wants he starts to yell. Because of this Buff and his father would fight all the time. Drinking can effect what you do, and what you say to others. I suggest that everyone should think on what can happen to them, if they become an alcoholic or if someone they know is an alcoholic."
1,uncompatability,The audiovox 2503421 cruise control stick is NOT compatible with audiovox's ccs-100. I ended up using the control pad that came with the ccs-100.
4,"Detailed yet readable, inspirational and helpful","Ms. Ganim's wealth of experience, fluency in art, and intuitive understanding of the human experience comes through in this book. Case studies and excellent color plates help to put life into the points and exercises she gives. There is a tendency to hyperbole and sometimes what seems too good to be true may be just that. But I concede that tendency to anyone who is enthusiastic about their work. This book is made to be used. The exercises are doable and procede in a logical, stepwise fashion. No one needs to be an artist to benefit from these exercises. Ms. Ganim's definition of healing as opposed to cure puts this work in perspective and gives it validity. I would highly recommend it to anyone seriously looking to experience healing in mind, body, and spirit."
2,"Not groundbreaking, not new information","In contrast to the previous reviewer, I have to say that this book is not groundbreaking. The author has simply taken material that already exists in the fields of art therapy and arts medicine, fashioned it into a book. There are so many other books that deal with this material such as MCNiff's Art as Medicine, Allen's Art is a Way of Knowing, and Malchiodi's Art Therapy Sourcebook, each provides more grounded, novel information than what is provided in this particular book. I also kept wishing that the author did not refer to cancer or illness as a gift-- that concept is tired and not appropriate to any literature on healing wisdom. This book would have been wiser to stay away from that all together."
2,really disappointing,"As a survivor of serious illness, I was really disappointed by the message of this book that art making would help to reveal the hidden metaphors of illness. Ideas such as cancer results from emotional repression of anger and heart disease is the lack of ability to love are insulting,frankly, to people who have serious medical conditions. The information in this book, while presented in an easy-to-read format, is simplistic in its tone and content. The author spends more time talking about herself and her workshops than giving the reader some real guidance on art making for healing. Illustrations are beautiful, but the content was less than satisfying"
2,Pipe is too small.,The suction hose is really way too small in diameter. It clogs very easily. Don't buy it for vacuuming your guinea pig pen.
3,Shop Vac,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. He seems to like it and says it does have good ""power"". I myself use it mainly for for vacuuming out the cars and it does as good a job as the one at the carwash."
1,DRIVE IS HORRIBLE...SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE...,"Congratulations, Philips, you've done it again...you've made a horrible drive and offer no support for it. The drive has burned only one DVD correctly in the months that I've had it. It will only burn onto Philips DVD+RW and Philips DVD+R discs. If you buy this, don't waste your money buying non-Philips discs, they won't work. And then when something does go wrong with the drive, they shift you around the Philips support sites. If you're going to spend this much on a burner, get an HP."
2,can't burn dvd+r's,"I have probably wrecked about a 12 DVD+R discs in this burner. I have 2.4GHz computer and have tried Nero 5, 5.5 and 6. I even took the advice of the guys at Philips to turn off every program in the task bar. Half of the discs cancel burning before they finish and the other half are mostly, if not entirely, unreadable. CDs and DVD+RWs work fine, but I already had a Cde burner and RWs cost twice as much as the Rs and they can't be put in DVD players."
5,Much better than older Philips burner drives,"I had one of the first CD-R drive (CDR2600) Philips made several years ago that I had wrecked many discs in. This time I got this drive with the computer 2.8GHz Compaq Presario 8000 I bought. I have to say it's a day and night difference. So far I have only used DVD+RW and CD-R discs and it worked flawlessly every time. The speed is satisfied. It surprised me that the drive writes faster with my old SCSI Jaz drive than with the 48X CD-ROM drive on the same bus with the burner. I have yet to try burn photo CD or VCD or video DVD. But for burning data discs, it's adequate."
4,Beautiful cards,"I am a casual card player and really like this designs this company has. They are unusual and pretty. They feel like the ""average"" card and probably will hold up about as well. I suspect they are geared more for people like me, who play occasionally and casually and are not as concerned about how well they wear. I will buy more from this company when they do wear out."
5,Unusual and Invaluable Colonial Era History,"This book provides a fascinating look at life in the Louisiana territory in the early 1700s. The author kept a rambling diary of everything that made an impression on him, from geography, wildlife and climate to French relations with various tribes of Native Americans, the Spaniards and English, and the black slaves. He waxes poetic over a beautiful sunset and also mentions the punishment for slaves conspiring to overthrow their masters. We learn where ""Baton Rouge"" got its name (a famous cypress) and how the Spaniards and English are scheming to pit tribes against each other and the French. Arguably the most fascinating material is where he describes the Natchez nation, the last living remnant of the once-great Mississippian cultures which were found from Arkansas to Georgia. Unfortunately, illustrations are not included in this edition, but it's a very readable and worthwhile book."
3,a little disappointed,"Nelly packs are great. I use them in my massage therapy practice. I recommend them to all my clients. I have one in the freezer for cold therapy and use one in the microwave for heat therapy. I can't say enough good things about them. They hold the cold or heat for a long time, and the effect really soaks into you, giving the most effective treatment. ***I was rather disappointed when I ordered these nelly packs though. I expected a ""large"" to be wider than 4 inches. The large nelly packs that I've ordered from another company is a good 8 inches wide and 20 inches long....large enough to treat a full area. These 4 inch wide packs are good for treating specific areas like the neck or a hand."
4,vaccum bags,It's hard to rate vaccum bags. I certainly have no compliants. They are sturdy and fit. What more can I say?
5,not just for nostalgia,These CDs are great to go back to get information from older releases. I'm trying to collect the entire InfoMagic set.
4,Good Book,This was a very good book. All the books about the Astra family are very interesting. It is easy to get involved in the series.
3,"Nice idea... but ""imagination not included"" ;-)",Not much to really say... it's a model dragon with changeable heads! Well made though. Best when mixed with knights and other fantasy stuff.
4,Only lasts one summer but a ton of fun!,"This pool isn't terribly durable and started to slowly leak air after 2 or 3 uses. That being said it was only [...], we can still use it for over 5 hours without re-inflating and my 1 and 3 year old LOVE this pool. We've spent hours and hours playing this summer and have hosted numerous play dates in our back yard with our alligator. As a new stay at home Mom, this pool was a lifesaver for me this summer!! Definitely get a pump to fill it instead of trying to blow it up."
3,Also sold at Toys R Us for $15.00,"This exact pool can be found at Toys R Us under the brand ""Banzai"" for $14.99. I purchased one today but have not set it up yet. I will update my review tomorrow after it is used."
4,"If I can do it, you can do it","I am computer illiterate and after a brief overview of the user friendly manual, I was creating photo albums in minutes. I have become an admirer of Jasc software. You may also want to try Paint Shop Pro 7, even us ignorant beginners can enjoy it!"
2,Tried it didn't like it,Love JASC products. This one I did not. I am now trying their Photo Album 4.0 on trail dowload. Much better product. can do more things with it than After Shot. Better camera support. Adding music sound track to a slide show is a couple mouse clicks. And can change soundtrack in a couple more mouse clicks. If you dowload the trial ver to use free for 30 days and wish to buy. They offer you a ... dicount on it. Boxed set on CD with manual only [money]. Photo Album is the lastest ver of After Shot. If you want to upgrade from it to Photo Album 4.0 they want [money]. Buy the photo Album 4.0 instead. More powerful and easy to use.
1,So simple its pathetic,"This program works like Microsoft photo editor, so why bother buying it. I will certainly try to get a refund. I wish there was a ZERO star."
3,Wonderful compilation,"I am not a fan of ""integral"" thinking, but this book was a good exploration of it, expanding well beyond its goofy notion of humans ""evolving"" into enlightened beings."
5,Born in East L.A. is one of my favorites.,The movie depicts a realistic situation that still occurs in parts of the United States. But the minds of the crazy C & C make the presentation hilarious and thought-provoking.
3,Nice shirt,"came in a timely fashion, which was great, but the T-Shirts at this place are a little pricey. whatever. buyer beware. they are just following the current internet standards that are out there. i wish someone would really start to price according to actual value..."
5,Great Device for Multiple Gaming Systems,"This game cart is awesome - holds my XBox 360, Wii, PS2, Dreamcast, and old NES with some creative positioning. Disregard any reviews that say this thing isn't sturdy - if you follow the directions, and tighten everything down. The wheels are optional, there are also some wide circular feet you can put on. I went with those for the extra sturdiness."
3,Maybe good for a dorm or small apartment,"The Gaming Tower is good for gaming systems like the pic shows but it didn't fit my needs. My receiver, CD player, and Tivo couldn't all fit with my XBox and Wii. I love the hooks on the sides to hold the remotes and guitars. It looks more like it belongs in a dorm or a first apartment instead of my home."
1,Remove the wheels before use. Buyer Beware.,"After having a problem with a previous video game storage system, I finally got the cash to buy an xBox 2 360 system. I hooked it up and had it on one side of the tv which proved to be a problem. Since it had wheels, I pushed it to the other side of the tv except the wires were stuck on the tv and the game system got pulled off and fell on my bear rug that I hunted myself.It's stupid that they'd put wheels on this because if someone sees it has wheels, they'll think they can move it around easy but instead you have to unhook everything. Why should I have to unhook stuff from behind the tv? The point of buying this was to be able to keep my game systems in something that looks really nice but they make people think you can wheel it around because they put wheels on it.If someone has a baby, I'd hate to own one of these since the baby will push it and probably have the xbox 2 360 or playstation 3 video game system fall on them."
4,Awesome musicianship! Let's see some more!,"Clocking in at 57 minutes, this DVD is a must have item if you are into Niacin as much as I am. If you are not familiar with Niacin, imagine a futuristic instrumental version of ELP. Billy Sheehan's bass playing continues to amaze me- 16 years after I first heard him! 'Three Feet Back' is not really on the DVD- it merely plays over the end credits, *BUT* for all of you bassists out there the short but amazing 'Clean Up Crew' is present. The next DVD should be longer in length and include different angles to toggle between- one for each amazing player! (that would make it the perfect DVD, IMHO)"
2,PRODUCT IS SO SO,THE LEATHER IS VERY NICE QUALITY BUT THE BUCKLE BROKE AFTER 3 USES. I WEAR IT TO THE GYM SO THE WEAR AND TEAR IS VERY MINIMAL. THIS IS DEFINITELY A DONT BUY!!!!!
2,Cheap buckle,"I love the size of this bag. The leather is nice, and the compartments are convenient. The problem is the buckle; it broke the 3rd or 4th time I used it. I bought a new clasp, thinking I'd replace it, but the strap is not standard size for the replacement buckles I could find. I'd have to replace the strap as well. Bummer."
1,Broke within 2 hours,I purchased 4 of these as I loved the size and compartments. I've used 2 and the belt broke within 2 hours and it just fell off. Not really safe with money inside.
1,Broke the minute I put it on,"The buckle was sewn on backwards, so when I tried to buckle it closed the first time I put it on, the buckle broke. Also, this flat fanny pack is actually very large in real life; I wanted something smaller. Because I was going out of town when I received this shipment, I did not contact the seller. The leather appears to be of adequate quality, but the buckle quality and assembly in my particular case were quite sub-par."
1,Leather fannypack,"Bought two of these fannypacks, one for myself and one for my mother, for our trip to Europe. The first day on our trip, the plastic buckle that attaches the waste strap together broke. My mother's broke the fifth day. I bought them because I liked the compact size. However, they were very cheaply made and a waste of money and I'm returning them."
1,waist money,"I bought this item about 1 month and use only couple times. The buckle was broken. Before i bought this item, I thought that it is flat and slim but the front pocket is pumped up, the design of the pocket is flip over and using the nylon fasterning tape which is not very stick very well. My V3 cell phone dropped from the front pocket. The price is great but only good for a month, it waist my money and my time to search other product."
5,The best collection of African-American Prayers ever! :-),"I chose this book because I say a lot of prayers at meetings and gatherings and I was looking for some prayers that would touch on the major issues of the African-American community. This book has been by far the greatest collection of prayers that I have encountered. It has prayers for children, parents, grandparents, peace, healing, graduation, students still in school, etc. It is just a wonderful asset to have for the African American Christian who knows the power of prayer!!!"
5,book,"My wife has this book and needed one for a dear friend that is going into the hospital, and she wanted her to have something good to read."
3,"A collection of papers, not a handbook at all","An handbook is usually a little fact book with just the factspresented in as understandable a fashion as possible.You have to look at this book from a price to benefit point of view.Most of these research / survey papers are just not presented in a teaching mode: more of a theorem and proof mode with references.The price tag per volume is over 200 dollars.My bet is that libraries and the authors are the main market,with most poor graduate students and post grads not being able to affordthe volumes at a price for both at of $400.The material is dense and not presented in enough detail thatthe result is very useful to a student.Here we have more ego than scholarship as a result?"
3,"Good, but not the best","If you are looking for a Thanksgiving story book, ""Thanksgiving at the Tappletons'"" is good and warm hearted.But books like ""The Thanksgiving Door"" or ""Molly's Pilgrim"" do a better job at conveying a sense of thanksfulness that transcends the usual native American/Pilgrim motif. ""How do we find connections rather than differences?"" is the central theme of a real thanksgiving, not turkey and stuffing."
1,the anti-thanksgiving book,"This story would be nice if it didn't teach your child about the merits of lying and dishonesty. Members of the family make simple mistakes, but each character refuses to take personal responsibility for ruining their share of Thanksgiving until it is too late. Grandpa tries to save Turkey Day by desribing the true meaning of the day, but it is too late to save this family of delinquents."
5,little George,George just teaches a lot of things and having Adventures.Kids love to watch him.GReat DVD I always Recommend George.
5,"First Ever ""King Of The Ring""","The first annual ""King Of The Ring"" was one of those very rare nights where the WWF did not pander to the fan favorite crowd. It was the first time in awhile that I can remember the WWF ending a pay-per-view on a less-than-flattering note for the ""good guys"". Yokozuna defeated Hulk Hogan for the WWF Title and seemingly ended Hulkamania. Crush was once again screwed by two Doinks. Bret Hart won the King Of The Ring but had his celebration interuppted by Jerry Lawler and was assaulted.This now-defunct PPV concept got weaker and weaker every year as they condenced it to a smaller event, many years later to fit in more of other matches. While the following year's event was without question, the best, and one of my favorite PPV's of that era, this KOTR event is excellent in its own right."
5,The first and best King Of The Ring ever,"Here are the resultsKing Of The Ring Quarterfinals1.Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart def. Razor Ramon2.Mr. Perfect def. Mr. Hughes (DQ)3.Bam Bam Bigalow def. ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan4.Tatanka vs ""The ""Narcissist"" Lex Luger (Draw)King Of The Ring Semifinals5.Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart def. Mr. PerfectWWF Championship6.Yokozuna def.

CrushKing Of The Ring FinalsBret ""The Hitman"" Hart def. Bam Bam Bigalow"
3,WWF King of the Ring 1993 review,"All of Bret Hart's matches in the tournament were outstanding. The 8 man tag team match served no real purpose thus making the bout a ""Big Lipped Alligator Moment"" The Lex Luger-Tatanka match was poorly planned and executed. The World title match between Hulk Hogan & Yokozuna was the worst match on the card becuase it had awful wrestling with a dumb ending to boot. The IC title match between HBK & Crush was a pretty good match and it could have better without the dumb 2 Doinks ending. The rest were ok. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10."
5,Feel safe using this harness!,"This harness is very well constructed. It's easy to put on and adjust. I'm 5'7"" and 180 lbs, but it's on loan to a guy who's 6'9"" and about 270 lbs. It fits him also. It is comfortable to wear all day. One D ring in back for fall restraint. Two D rings on the front hips to use if you are on steep roofs and need to tie off. We are both very pleased that we can go about working on roofs without fear of falling off. Well written instructions and OSHA regs to follow if you use this for business. Price is right and made in the USA."
2,Skye,"I listened to clips of songs from this CD, and I think Skye is an okay singer, but not so good that she should have a recording contract. I haven't heard enough of ""Tangled Up In Me"" to know exactly how much I like it, but I know ""Too Late"" and ""Tidal Wave"" are annoying. I think Skye Sweetnam is going to go out unless her new album ""Noise From the Basement"" is a hit, and actually has good songs on it."
3,I can't decide is she good or bad?,"Skye seems like she has a good voice, but she chooses childish songs. I like her song Tangled up in me. I think it's cute. But some songs she trys to be too cute. I give her 3 stars becuase she has a very good voice, but she needs to put it to use a little better. If Skye was to magically read this, I'd tell her that she should do a duet with a very popular artist, then maybe she would see what she has and how to put it to good use.I LOVE tangled up in me and her Christmas songs. So Skye you are almost there!!"
5,SOMEONE FINALLY FOUND OUT WHY DIETS DONT WORK-GOOD-BY WEIGHT,"I FOUND THAT MANY OF THE COMMERCIAL DIET PROGRAMS DON'T WORK IN SPITE OF MY BEST EFFORTS ,I WOULD PUT ON WEIGHT..AFTER READING PROTIEN POWER I NOW KNOW WHY. THEY ARE ALL BASED ON HIGH CARB. LOW FAT,LOW PROTIEN. I FOUND MY SELF HUNGRY WITH MANY HIGHS AND LOWS . PROTIEN POWER KEEPS YOU ON AN EVEN KEEL AND NOT WONDERING ABOUT WHERE THE NEXT MEAL IS COMING FROM. WHEN I STICK TO IT I DON'T HAVE THE URGE TO CHEAT AND THE WEIGHT COMES OFF. I HEARTILY RECOMMEND IT TO THOSE WHO ""CAN'T STAY ON A DIET.AND THOSE TIRED OF YO-YO DIETING"
5,No joke. . .this way of eating is sensational.,"After two months on the plan, my husband has lost 35 pounds, six inches on his waist, and has gained much self respect. I am not overweight, but have lost two inches on my waist, five pounds of fat, and my stomach is much smaller. The Protein Power Plan keeps us from being hungry. The kids like eating the vegetables with us. I never thought I could eat a filet mignon every Saturday and not feel guilty. Now I feel like it is making ME leaner."
5,"Finally, a diet that makes sense with the science to back it","I had a friend that told me about the diet from his doctor. I though nothing of it at first. Then, I met a nurse that used to work with Dr. Eades who told me a similar story. Both had lost weight and kept it off with this ""diet"". Both my wife and I were interested and we bought the book that night. I read it through on the first night. I was fascinated by the scientific explanation of the master hormones. In the last week of May, I started. By the 4th of July, I had lost 35 pounds and 4"" off of my waist. I was not a saint either! Just like the book says, I used type 1 strictly after falling off the wagon and got right back on track. My percent body fat has dropped from 24% to 13% and I feel great. My wife has lost over 20 pounds in the same time frame. I have noticed one minor problem, I get cold now! Little did I know how much insulation I had before. Buy this book and use it. You will feel and look great."
3,Zone Plan is a more sound lifestyle,"I have researched a number of diets from a scientific point of view. I believe the Atkins, Eades, and Zone plans appear to be the best of them all. However, of the three I have personally chosen the Zone Plan by Dr. Barry Sears. It is backed by the most scientific studies and FOR THAT REASON makes the most sense to me. I am not prone to experiment on myself with fad diets.I just thought I was in excellent shape before I ""Entered the Zone"". I have since obtained optimum health and fitness beyond what I thought was possible.Again, while they are similar there are some differences in the types and balance of proteins, carbs, and fat. I believe all 3 are better than any other diet on the market but the Zone is as close to ""perfection"" that you are going to get!"
1,Be careful! This diet is not for everyone.,"I have been on this diet for five days. I have not lost an ounce. In fact, I have gained a pound and a half, and am constipated. I had a headache for the first four days. Although I have a friend who was on the diet and lost 7 pounds the first week, not everyone can go on this diet. I have been looking for a forum, wherein I can communicate with others, but have found none. I'm sure it works for most people, but everyone's system is different."
1,I believe that you need a PHD to understand this.,"I borrowed this book from the library the other day. I'm sorry but I could not understand how to calculate the formulas that are required to start this diet. I was looking forward to starting this diet and hopefully experiencing a new way to loose weight. At this point I feel discourage and I will purchase the Dr. Atkins book. I find it hard to follow certains recipies I would much prefer to have a food guideline to follow. Please help me figure out this chart as I am desperate to drop at least 20 pounds by the summer. Also, I would like to know if anyone has also had a hard time to figure out these charts."
1,"Was a low carb believer, but not anymore","I bought the book on vacation 2 years ago. Lost weight immeadiately and preached low carb to anyone that would listen. Was convinced I would stick with it for life. Just not possible (for me anyway). Gained weight back faster than ever, plus some. Tried to go back on it several times but weight wouldn't come off like before. Jan 1, 2001 started following Weight Watchers, didn't join the program, just used the point calculator. I've lost more and kept it off easier than ever before. I'm convinced the ONLY way to lose weight is to EAT LESS. Food isn't a reward, eating out is not an event. The mind set must change to lose weight and keep it off. If you eat less, you want less."
2,help my blood sugar but devastated my cholesterol,"This book was presented in such persuasive format that I actually tried it. I had cholesterol problem before I tried the diet(total cholesterol at 276), blood sugar within normal range but behave rather strangely--my after meal reading is actually lower than the 12 hrs fast. Anyway, I tried the diet for several months. My blood sugar remain pretty much the same but now the after meal reading is slightly higher than the 12 hrs fast. But my cholesterol went haywire! It is now at 326! I'm changing back to my near vegetarian diet for sure!"
4,protein good,Good book on proteins and how they affect your health. Protein is the only thing that repairs your body. I'm in.
3,It's working!,"This diet is, initially, counter-intuitive yet logical when placed in context. It may even be considered politically incorrect, but it works. After eight weeks, I've lost twelve pounds and my wife has lost seven. Hopefully my cholesterol counts have also dropped, too, like the results described in this book -- I have yet to have my blood tested.While I miss baquettes, pastas and chocolate, it is not that difficult to adhere to, although some might find it hard to keep up with the water intake requirements.Good Luck!"
2,Doesn't work for everybody,"I was on the Protein Power plan for a year and a half. Three meals a day was red meat, cheese, and eggs. My weight went from 192 to 192; my cholesterol soared from 143 to 210! A few months ago, after finally being forced to conclude that the plan simply wasn't working for me, I went back to eating rice, beans, noodles, bread, and cereal. What do you know: my cholesterol has already plummeted to 172. But... right after I started on the plan, I turned my brother on to it. He dropped 15 pounds almost overnight and leveled off at a 20-pound loss. So give it a try; it may work for you. It didn't for me. But nothing works for everybody, not even aspirin or condoms."
1,Never Have I Been So Disappointed In A Book,I cannot believe that this book made it past the publishing stages. It does not work!!! I am still fat!
1,Fast Aging = Excessive Protein intake,"Eating a lot of protein is a sure way to age fast. It puts way to much strain on the digestive and eliminative organs. If you are interested in health and fighting aging every step of the way, like I am, then don't follow this book. The way to health and ""Stopping The Clock"" (a name of a book I read)is exercise, tons of fruits and vegetables, and a little protein. People who reach a 100 years old eat very little protein. I would only follow this book if I was obese and I had to lose a lot of pounds immediatly. So in summary if you want to look 60 years old when you reach 40 then go ahead and eat the bacon, sausage, cheese. I choose not to look shriveled by age 40, so there is no way I am following it."
1,A Waste of Money & Emotion,"I lost weight at first and got all excited, but then gained it all back. How depressed I became I can't even begin to tell you. Thank god I came across a book by Gary Rempe that really works and finally did lose my weight for good. Check him out and save yourself some grief."
4,Doing great so far !!!!,"I just started this diet a little over a week ago, after having read the book. I, too, have tried other diets in the past with very little success. I am 34 and, because I am taking estrogen and two other medications which tend to inhibit weight loss and, in my opinion, slow down one's metabolism, I have had an even harder time losing weight. (I'm 5'7"" and my weight fluctuates between 158 and 165) Today is day 10 on the diet and I've lost 3 lbs. I was hoping the weight would come off a little faster, but I'm being patient and following the diet faithfully. The only problem I seem to be having is that it really decreases my appetite and I have to remind myself to eat! I was wondering if anyone has any advice or comments with regard to the success of this diet on someone who is taking these types of medications (i.e., hormones, anti-depressants, etc.)"
3,Protein diets are for real.,"My friends have read the book, although I have not. But, after I stopped running 70 miles a week because of my job, I gained 30 pounds. After a year I got tired of being overweight so my friends told me to eat protein only, and some tricks learned in the book. In 2 weeks I have lost 8 pounds, so no more carbs for me!!!"
3,"It works, but not for the reasons you think","Low-carb diets are still reigning supreme as the weight-loss fad du jour, but ""Protein Power"", a more sensible version of the plan, is often lost in the glare of the better-known Atkins diet. Doctors Michael (a cardiologist) and Mary Dan (who specializes in eating disorders) Eades present a fairly easy-to-follow plan that emphasizes protein and produce rather than pasta, and if one follows the plan to the letter they will find themselves losing weight. However, their insistence that weight loss is due to the ""rebalancing"" of insulin and not because ... well, you're eating less and working out renders the idea a bit far-fetched (and sorry, doctors, those cheesy infomercials don't help your cause, either). Still, this is a good book to get a jump on healthy living, and hey, if it makes you put down that donut it's all good!"
5,This book explains body biomechanics.,"This book explains how your body burns and stores fat. It does it in language that anyone with a grade school education can understand. The diet not only works, it works just as discribed in the book. I have been on it now for 2 months and have lost 34 pounds. And, I have every expectation of keeping it off for the long term. All of the negative reviews I have read on Amazon are not based on fact or research but on emotions. If you are overweight do yourself a favor and buy this book, its the best use of your money you will ever make."
5,Here's a question:,"I have read this book and have enjoyed keeping up with the customer comments, however, the one thing I've noticed is nobody has mentioned a weight loss of more than about 40 pounds. Granted, this is a large amount of weight to lose but I am interested in finding a program that will incourage a loss of about 100-125lbs. and will also keep it off! Protein Power may be that program but, to reasure me, I would sincerely appreciate any comments from individuals who have experienced such a successful weight loss. Thanks!"
5,Protein Power Bible,I must say that I am/was the biggest skeptic in the world regarding this diet plan. After buying this book and conducting much research I decided to give this diet plan a try. The results after 10 weeks? -- both my wife and myself have lost 23 pounds each! As stated in the book - this diet is a change of life style - forever! The key to success with this diet is to follow it exactly as described in the book -- no deviations.
5,The proof is in the data!,"I started reading on 3-27-98, couldn't put it down and finished it on 3-29-98. The dietary studies are thorough and all claims are supported by ample data. I would recommend this book to anyone as a text for understanding why the high carb methods do not work, especially for muscle building and maintainence."
5,This diet really works!,This book makes it clear why low-fat/high carb diets don't work for everyone. I have lost 6 lbs. in 5 days without feeling hungry. My craving for sweets is diminishing more and more each day. Several friends of mine have used this diet with great success.
5,You really won't believe it until you try it!,"All of the reviews you read are true. I have experienced the same thing. Been on the plan (not a diet) for about a month now and have already lost 20 pounds and two belts sizes. I am well on my way to my goal.One of my favorite things, which turned up a few noses at first at the office at first, is to make ""pork rind pizza!"" You heard me right. Spread the rinds out on the plate, cover with cheese and a single layer of pepperoni and microwave for about 20 seconds! You will not believe how good they are - the office staff is now converted!Don't waste any more time with low-fat, high-carbs. Get into life with this plan and lose the weight you want to lose - NOW!"
5,The Protein Powerlife Plan,"I really love this health plan!! I have already lost 15 lbs in 3 wks using this plan!! You do have to make life changes by changing your eating habits to keep the weight loss off. I haven't felt so good since I was a young kid in school!! I didn't work out at all and just by changing my eating habits and taking the right supplements, I lost weight and I feel great!! Now I am starting a 30 minute a wk workout program designed by the same authors with the help of a fitness expert and I hope to lose more and tone my body!!"
2,Any dieticians out there?,"Have not read the book, but would like to hear reviews from Registered Dietitions and nutritionists. Anecdotal results from readers whose science is nil are not safe recommendations for those who wish to lose weight. Just remember the old saw ""Diets don't work"" or the perfect one would've been found by now. This book seems to appeal to those who want the old quick fix after years of abuse. Have heard good things about Dr. Edward Taub's books on eating properly."
1,"I strictly followed this diet, gained weight & got sick.","A couple of my friends lost weight following a loose interpretation of this diet. I was intriuged by the counter-intuitive claims of this book and had to try the diet myself. It required much time, energy and math to follow the plan precisely. I did. It failed. Not only did I experience decreasing energy each day I stayed on the diet,(for ten days), I ate like a pig (as allowed) yet was continually hungry and gained weight. This may work for some people, it sure didn't work for me. The tone of this book sounds often like a sales pitch. Now I see they're hard selling this book with a TV informercial. --I piched my copy of the book, not wanting anyone else to pollute their body with it's missguided advice."
2,Is it just me?,"Is it just me or do most of the reviews on this page sound like they were written by professional ad writers? Perfect diction, syntax, grammar -- how curious. At any rate, I tried this diet plan and failed miserably. I lost three pounds in one month, and I imagine most of it was shed in water form. The book was easy to read and follow, but the plan didn't work for me."
2,Anyone have any ideas?,"I have been following the Protein Power plan quite faithfully for 5 months and have lost very little weight. Apparently this is due to a very slow metabolism, I would guess. I see in some of the earlier reviews that other people have had the same difficulty. Does this mean I should go back to Weight Watchers? How long should I stick with it before concluding that this simply will never work for me and I should try something else? Email me if you would like, just write a message ""Protein Power"" otherwise I won't open your message. Thanks!"
4,I have found my recipe for success in Protein Power,"I have tried almost everything with no success, just more weight gain and that awful ""heavy"" feeling. I found Protein Power about 2 wks ago and am having a great time! I enjoy the food, feel more energetic, and actually look forward to weighing in. In the first 1 1/2 wks I lost almost 2lbs which would have taken me months without this program. I am eating food that I love for the first time and no guilt involved!"
5,I think this book is saving my life,"After 3 weeks on this diet I am losing weight and feel great. My blood pressure has stabilized and is now normal. It was high normal (135-140/90) now it is normal and I can actually feel that it is down as I go through my day. Overall my belief is that carbo's can kill you. Our society has dictated carbo's as healthy. THEY ARE NOT! Protein Power doesn't mean eating steak morning, noon and night. It means moderation and keeping a close eye on eating 4 dinner rolls before your huge plate of pasta is set before you at dinner(carbo central). I think if I ate that now I would puke."
2,Looks more like a text book!,Not very pratical unless you are harcore into a diet. I would reccomend The South Beach Diet instead.
1,Always doing things the easy way,"While being on a protein-packed diet may cause you to lose weight if you're overweight or obese, the results won't last. Exercise and a diet full of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is what a person needs to live a healthy life. The reason people gain weight when they exercise is because they gain muscle, which weights more than fat.The scale, therefore, is quite deceiving. I ran a cross-country season and gained ten pounds, but it was all muscle. DIETS DON'T WORK! Make a commitment to a healthy lifestyle, and you'll look better and feel great! Remember - balance is the key, so check out the food pyramid!"
3,"Book Good, Bad Diet","They book is great...but the diet is horrible. Horrible for your checkbook, and your body. Any diet that totally elimiates something is bad for you. I wish I hadn't done it. To keep of the weight you loose while on this diet, you pretty much have to do this the rest of your life. Yes, it is a lifestyle change. I wasn't ready to give up bread, pasta, potatoes or any of that for the rest of my life.Try Weight Watchers instead"
1,I Would Rather Throw It Away,This was a terrible book! Couldn't understand it at first and I'm a nurse. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Even Amazon thought is was bad and they are selling it. I'm throwing my copy out rather than give it to someone else. That says it all.
4,IT WORKED!,"Both my wife and I started last October. We didn't follow the book 100%, only used it as a guide. It explained how carbs affect insulin in the body and how that affects fat. I am not an expert but can give testimony of the results. As of the beginning of 2000, I've lost over 20 pounds (from 207 to 185)and my wife almost 30. (we're both in our 40's) We did not increase our exercising or take any additional weight loss or magic fat absorbing pills- only vitamins. We made thru the Holidays with no weight gain! Eat all the meat and cheese you want. It's amazing. You'll learn what foods are high in Carbs and what to avoid. We're now on a ""maintenance"" program watching those Carbs!"
3,Not for Everyone,"This book is neither good nor bad, and like everything else in this world, it isn't for everyone. If you haven't read the book, ""Eat Right 4 Your Type"", I strongly encourage you to do so. It suggests that certain blood types like type ""O's"" metabolize meat more efficiently than type ""A's"", so this may help to explain why some people have had successes and others challenges. I also feel that high protein diets work best for men. Just a thought....."
5,MINNESOTA MEALTIME,"My wife and I have heard a great deal about this great diet plan that seems to be the best way to go about losing the pounds. In all fairness, I believe we cannot really give this product a rating due to we have yet to try it and see for ourselves if this is the way to go? We will comment again in one month and let you know what the results are for our weight loss goals. Wish us luck. My wife is out picking up the ""Protien Plan"" and the ""Carbo Counter"" books as of this moment. Stay tuned for our futrure reports.The BeBault's"
4,Beats Atkins -better results,"The Power Protein Plan is an excellent program. The book details every aspect, including cholesterol, triglycerides, heart disease, diabetes...and explains how this protein plan can actually positively affect each.My husband is diabetic and is on insulin and oral drugs to maintain his out of control blood sugar. I put him on the protein power plan and his blood sugar dropped enough that he could do away with 3 shots and the oral drug. He never felt better, but his self-destructive nature has caused him to forego sticking to the plan entirely-which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5: If you cheat on this plan, you will gain weight and probably cause your blood levels to rise.All in all, a healthy, easy plan--the included recipes are really quite good-though time-consuming."
5,The best book for low-carbers yet,"This was my 4th purchase of this book. Every other time I bought it, it came up in discussion, and I ended up giving it away. This time I will refer them to Amazon.com to buy their own copy.It has its flaws, in that it doesn't dwell on the obsese and how their body fat percentages, and carb/protein needs vary, but even for the obese, it gives so much valuable information that I consider the book indispensable.Not only does it give the science behind how the body works - in very easy to read terms - but it talks about what to look for in a vitamin/mineral supplement, and it shows some before/after pictures of a man that I find SO INSPIRATIONAL. (1st picture, when he was a scrawny marathon runner. 2nd picture when he was obses. 3rd picture after 6 moths of low-carbing combined with strength training. How could these men be the same men? It's a miracle.I highly recommend this book!!!!"
4,This book worked for my wife and me.,"My wife and I followed the low-fat advice for years, slowly gaining weight the whole time. After switching to the low-carbohydrate diet advocated by this book, (which was suggested to us by our doctor), both of us have dropped huge amounts of body fat in spite of eating eggs, meat, cheese, butter, etc. We look and feel much better!The only reason I gave this book four stars is for the exercise advice. The authors advocate weight lifting as aerobic -- personally, this doesn't work for me. I did take up weight-lifting per their advice, but I still need to get on my bike 2-3 times per week to really shed the fat. I wish they had pushed a combination strength-training/aerobic exercise plan."
2,Disappointed,"This book had too many formulas to compute different things in order to see where to begin on the diet. On the body fat calculation chart, there is no female list, just male as far as I could find. I will try to finish the book and utilize as much as I can from it however."
4,Made sense of the weight/weight loss problem,"Once you turn 50, it's all down hill. I'd tried everything and nothing worked. Someone lost mega pounds on this eating plan so I thought I had nothing to lose. It's sensible and so easy. I lost 13 pounds and inches right away. Just the boost that gave me ensures that I'll stick to this eating plan. The authors give lots of common sense ideas and include how to eat when you end up in a fast food resturant. They recognize this a strict plan for weight loss and even tell you how to add in carbos to maintain your weight. A wonderful plan and a great book."
5,Great!,"We (my boyfriend and I) have been on your program for 1 month and feel great. Although we are not overweight, we'd like to change the fat-muscle ratio, which is occurring as we sit here.I do get heartburn after certain foods, tuna and some chicken dishes, but it makes me drink more water. Jon gets tired in the evening, but it is also winter and dreary outside. We have been concentrating on aerobic exercise, but soon will hit the weights, which I am sure will show a large difference in our body structure. I am 31, Jon is 33. We are trying to get the others at work to join us in our new way of eating, (we are firefighters, and some of them aren't the healthiest of guys!) It seems to have a slight impact as they observe our ""weight"" loss."
1,"This Diet Is Wonderful, IF YOU AREN'T ADDICTED TO CARBS!","While the diet does point out interesting facts, I still hate the premise. I mean, I've lost 31 pounds in a little under 3 months on HIGH-CARB, low fat, and my health is great. This diet is not the best way to go, because anything that is restrictive can't be good in the long run."
1,This diet does not work!,"I gave this diet more than a fair chance, followed it to the letter for almost two months and I can honestly say it doesn't work. The very first week I lost 5 pounds of water weight and that was it for the whole 2 months. Please don't waste your time on this fad diet. Since quitting this diet I I gained back the 5 pounds I lost on Protein power and then decided to go on a diet of my own. I cut my calories down to 1200 a day and have since lost 15 pounds(over about 2 months.) I'm telling you folks, cutting your calories and exercising is the only way to really permanently lose weight; not eating lots of protein and cutting out carbs. Trust me, I tried this and was very disappointed."
2,"It doesn't work for everyone, doesn't work for me","I just think the book is tooo complicated, but it's educating. I have already on this diet for about a month and I only lost 2 pounds. The worst thing I feel very very unhealthy. I felt sick all the time, lightheaded, I could't concentrated, worse I always feel like wanting to yell at everyone because I feel like a sick person, it's weird 'coz I always felt hungry, and couldn't stop snacking. I want to exercise but have no energy to really do it. Probably it worked for some people, but doesn't work for me. I can't take a day without enough fruits and veggies. I had a constipation on this diet. Once I felt too depressed waiting my scale to drop a pound, which didn't happened at all, I bit an apple and eat a tuna salad and I felt sooo much better than eating slices of bacon with scrambled eggs. Too litlle carb is not good for you anyway. Brain's food is sugar. So take enough carb each day."
3,Probrably Works but too complicated,"The idea of eating this way for the rest of your life is pretty unrealistic. Im sure that their theories are correct and it may be the best way for you to eat, but it is eliminating a majority of foods in the world. Im a little hesitant about any plan that limits the amounts of fruit and veges. However if you have any major health problems, diabetes, heart disease and so on you should probrably try it since you will have to modify your diet drastically anyway. If I had a serious health problem that was life or death i would defenitly do this plan. However if you just want to loose some weight and still need conveinence foods or want anything pre packaged or frozen (or some birthday cake at a birthday party) than you should probrably look elsewhere. I dont like to cook especially 3 or more times a day and I have a busy lifestyle that needs some fast food and pre packaged stuff."
1,Nothing new here,"Don't waste your time, read the original by Dr. Atkins. Half of this book contains nothing but recipes."
2,"Re-Hash Old Stuff in Another Package, AND MORE!","Hubby and I bought the audio tape version and then the actual book. Although well-enough written, with clearly defined studies on actual participants, the fact remains that I developed severe chronic hives from eating too much protein and not enough carbos. Watch out. Not only did I end up having to undergo emergency room visits for shots of Benedryl and Epinephrine, but I had to continually take Benedryl daily, plus Prednisone, to combat the hives. When I ended the diet, the hives didn't stop. My abdomen (colin) was taking in too large of molecules from the protein overabundance. After a brief stint on Acidophilus, I was fine. And I did lose 14 pounds. Just be careful."
4,"Concise, informative and fun to read","This is the first time I've read a diet book from cover to cover. I suppose it was because I intended to take the diet seriously. I have known a number of people who had tried a number of protein diets. This one appeared to be one that I could easily stick with. Unfortunately for me, I gained almost 7 pounds over the course of sticking to this diet for 6 weeks. I guess this just may not be the diet for everybody...but again EVERYONE I know who has been on this (and other protein diets) have done very well. But, boy, talk about being frustrated...."
4,It worked for me,"The authors say that by consuming lots of carbohydrates over many years, many people develop resistance to insulin; as they grow older they make more insulin for the same amount of carb intake. But insulin stores fat molecules in fat cells, so increased insulin makes us store more fat. If you keep your insulin levels low, by eating less carbohydrate, you'll store less fat.I gave the book only four stars because although they mention scientific papers backing this hyperinsulemia hypothesis they don't cite them bibliographically, so you can't evaluate their thesis. However, the book isn't a scientific treatise, and I lost 35 pounds in five months loosely following their recommendations, so who cares whether they got the cause right -- the effect was good, and easy to accomplish.They also claim reduced levels of bad cholestorols and triglycerides, which I've not verified."
5,This diet changed my life!,"After having ""failed"" at every diet imaginable, and suffering from blood sugar problems as a result, I have lost a healthy 40 pounds in 7 months, and my cholesterol went from over 300 to 147! I haven't had this much energy in years, and my blood sugar problems have all disappeared!"
5,"I was sceptical, but this deck is wonderful!","When I first received the Pagan Tarot, I was skeptical. Would modern images serve to trivialize the tarot? To my great relief, however, I found that this deck works well as a tarot, despite its modern-day images. In addition, I've found that this deck lends itself beautifully to reading for myself. Rev. Pace's meanings serve as a great reality check with a side of pithy, and always apposite, advice. It's refreshing that she does not rely solely, or even mostly, upon the Waite-Smith deck's meanings. Her twists on The Devil and The Tower, for example, take some getting used to, but they work. The Lovers card expresses ""choice"" better than any other deck I've seen, also. The deck is more Wiccan than pagan, in my opinion, but I think it would work well for any pagan seeking a deck that will help her to be more objective in self-reading."
5,God Bless Frank Black...,"for giving us not just one great album, but two. Sounds something like seventies classic rock...in a parallel dimension. Less country, more rockin' than BLD. Less ramblin', more to the point. Which one's better? Black Letter Days or Devil's Workshop? Guess it depends what mood you're in. No Rich Gilbert, though. Instead Lyle Workman and Joey Santiago are back-and have never sounded better. Great stuff!"
3,I'm ok with this album,"In my opinion, this album is one of the decent albums of freestyle/dance genre that has been released so far, but haven't I heard ""Daydreaming"" from Bad Boy Joe Vol.3? I would rather buy that. Also, if you're looking for the best freestyle albums, may I suggest Bangin' Beats: Then & Now."
4,Not-so complete set of Charles Dickens,"Have been looking for this set for a long time. It was published early in the 20th Century as a 30-volume set. That's what we ordered, but only received only 27 volumes."
3,Tiny Item - HUGE Shipping Cost!,"WARNING: This tiny item may be just $3.49, but shipping was nearly $7.00. And, THAT was the cheapest option.Otherwise, it does what it says it does, at over twice the cost of the actual item."
4,Meditations on Abraham's Life,"This book wasn't terribly long, I got through it in a week or so, but don't let it's brevity fool you! Each of the 10 chapters are power-packed. Jack Hayford takes us on a step-by-step journey as Abraham was instructed to ""get out of the country"" and go to Caanan, through his life, drawing parallels that we can relate to. Showing us how very human he was, helping us to learn from his journey. It was very insightful!Chapter titles are:1. The Commitment to God's Will2. Muddling Your Way in the Will of God3. Settling Problems in the Will of God4. Warfare in the Will of God5. Learning to Walk in the Dark6. How to Deal with the Flesh7. Responding to God's Presence8. Faith Comes Out of Hiding9. The Power of Total Commitment10. The Ultimate in God's Will"
1,NOT as Ravel should be played...,"Her artificial pauses (NOT AS WRITTEN IN THE SCORES) ruin the overall shape of the works. Her phrasing is FAR TOO SHORT FOR RAVEL, omg she can't focus for more than 4 bars sometimes. This pianist is technically fine but her ""interpretation"" of Ravel does a disservice to his music! I'd HATE to have listen her gag her way through the second movement of his concerto in G, imagine her pitiful little pauses and phrases added to a melody line the length of 56+ bars in length.I'm really surprised a ""Fanatic"" in here reviewed it and commented on the rubato as a good thing! With Ravel? NEVER unless he wrote a darned comma into the score (as in his Valses Sentimentales) then MOVE ON and CONTINUE the MUSIC. Don't pause for breath. The phrasing is in the BALNCE and the COLOR of the instrument and how the pianist brings it out. This one FAILS!Yuck yuck and YUCK!"
2,Horrible DVD transfers,The picture quality of these to movies is appalling. It's good to own as a part of the collection but does nothing to improve the viewers interest thus making it look dated. Wonder how bad the studios are doing if they can't maintain any standards for DVD picture quality.
5,A vintage treasure,"For collectors of antique art, this is a must. The book is huge and beautiful, and the artwork superb. These are glorious reproductions of paintings of the zodiac, solar system, and planets by Andreas Cellarius (1596-1665). The Plates show Cellarius' artwork in magnificent color and detail, and many show the work in close-up. An incredibly beautiful book and a rare treasure!"
2,"Attractive pix, poor maps, some dated material","I was disappointed in this guide. Although some of the photography was vivid, there was a surprising lack of detailed maps of Buenos Aires (in marked contrast to what might be found in ""Eyewitness"" guides, for example). I also thought it was strange that the ""1998 reprinting of the 1996 edition"" should note in the ""Getting There/By Air"" section (page 243): ""From New York, fly EASTERN""! (Eastern Airlines hasn't flown anywhere for years!)I also felt the book was poorly organized, and that it was a challenge to find specific information quickly."
1,don't bother to read this,"Why would anyone bother to read this when there is the lonely planet guide available? This is in my opinion a vastly inferior guide when compared not just to lonely planet but to many of the others available, it lacks organisation and detail."
3,Udder Confusion,"This book was well worth reading but even tho they move to Alaska and build a log cabin on their homestead they don't live off the land. Eventually they build a dairy farm.The husband has to hold down jobs till they get the dairy farm going.I guess I expected more of a ""live off the land type book""All the descriptions of picking wild berries and catching salmon makes your mouth water !!Inspite of the silly title it was pretty good."
3,Hot Mike!,"This is a pleasant reminder of how Mr. Duke used multiple keyboards to create a singular voice when he first ""blew up"" on the 70's fusion scene. But I'm having a hard time getting past the acoustic piano going way up into the red zone every time he comes down hard on the keys. So unlike Kerry McNabb's other engineering work from that time."
5,perfect,"This is the cheapest piece of furniture I have ever bought in the most hilarious way possible. I reccommend purchasing it just for the fun of it. And as it turns out, it holds coats too! Actually, it is totally functional, you have to put it together yourself and for the most part it seems to be actually made of wood except for the rings at the top and the bottom which are plastic. And each piece (there are 13) comes wrapped in an excessive amount of saran wrap rather than... say... a plastic bag. But it's up and it's plenty sturdy."
1,"Poorly made, not functional","Made with cheap wood, a couple of the arms broke off soon after putting it together. Even worse, the stand is not well balanced and would frequently tip over when hanging or removing coats. I replaced it with a better one after a few frustrating months."
2,Cherry Coat Rack,"Served our needs...not top quality, but good price. 1st shipment was damaged and returned by shipper without my knowlege...fortunately I called customer service and they sent another out in time for our event (it was a theater prop)"
1,"Ugly, Poor Service and Impossible to put together","Cannot be assembled by a reasonably intelligent, college graduate. I am trying to return it and the customer service is simply terrible. I am very displeased with this item. It is unattractive, flimsy and has no assembly instructions. The holes don't seem to line up and I am not sure which parts are supposed to fit where since nothing fits."
3,Cherry Coat Rack,"The coat rack is decent for the price. It is a little flimsy and leans to one side more if nothing is on the other side of the rack, but it does the job. The price was a lot better than others I had found, so overall it is a decent coat rack."
1,JUNK,"This program has mostly files written in 1989, on a CD-R copy disc produced by a cut-rate publisher. They do not support the product, unless you pay PER THE MINUTE over the phone. In short this product is not worth it, even as cheap as it is."
1,Rip-off Software No Longer in Production,"This software was taken off the market by the publisher about 5 years ago because they used someone else's brand name, ""CheckWriter"". This is not the real CheckWriter software even though lots of people think it is when they buy it.This software is surplus stock that had to be taken off the shelves in Staples and Office Max and is now being sold at a deep discount to unsuspecting customers.The real product you are likely looking for is at [...].This product will not work on new operating systems and prints items that are no longer in compliance with Check21 regulations. It is not worth it."
1,Not as advertised,THIS PRODUCT WAS LISTD AS WORKING ON WINDOWS AND MAC MACHINES.AFTER RECEIVING IT I FOUND IT WOULD ONLY WORK ON WINDOWS AND I HAVE A MAC.
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"This product is advertised as working on Windows, Mac, Linux and Unix. IT doesn't. The package says that it requires Windows. The website for the company (listed on the package as www.elibrium.com) has NOTHING to do with software; it's for phone cases.The phone number Amazon gave me for the company is not answered. It rings once and stops.This is truly a FRAUDulent product."
2,Boring Play Mat,"We had this playmat for my first son and he was never entertained by it for more than a couple of minutes. He did like the butterfly, but that was about it. I wouldn't recommend it and we'll definitely be getting something different for our second son."
1,The glasses that could have been,I would have loved the glasses if I had received them in one piece. But instead after two tries I received broken messes. I don't understand why Amazon would offer something like wine glasses if they were not able to ship them safely. The 2nd attempt brought me 2 glasses that weren't broken and one that has an unusually large stem that I have to assume is a defect.
1,A great disappointment from DK,"A book full of pictures that does not tell you have to take those pictures!If you want to see colorful pictures of various kinds, buy the book. But if you want to learn how to take those pictures, buy something else."
5,Barenboim on Mozart,This is a sublime recording of the complete recordings of the Mozart piano concerto (except 7 and 10 which are concertos with 2 and 3 pianos) I cannot express how highly I regard these recordings and how skilfully Barenboim weaves his pianistic tapestry on the listener.
5,Great performances of inspired music,"This set is beautifully performed and is also priced competitively. I am very satisfied with my purchase, though I'm sorry it doesn't include the concertos for 2 and 3 pianos.Barenboim's own cadenzas are enjoyable. I don't notice any lack of maturity in the playing, but this may be my inexperience!Some prefer Ashkenazy, but it is quite a bit more expensive [though it does include those works just mentioned].I am confident most readers will be very happy with this set.Highly recommended"
4,A little behind Perahia and Ashkenazy,"Danny B. is good, especially on the big ones like the 25 and 26. He isn't as poetic as Murray or as flashy as Vlad but steady never-the-less.The ECO shows some slack playing at times which belies their consistency for Perahia and Ashkenazy."
3,It's fairly good.,I agree with most of the other comments. It's better than Devil's Workshop which just came out with it. I recommend getting it especially if you are a Frank Black afficienado as I claim to be. I have Oddballs and I liked it as well if not better than these two new cds.
3,Boring for a Fourth Grader,"Tikta'liktak is a young Eskimo hunter. His father is a great hunter. In a time of little food and warmth Tikta'liktak goes on a adventure to a different island. Were he confronts a bear, kills 3 seals, and builds a home. But he started feeling lonely. He did not know how to get home. He figures out a way to blow-up the seal skins and make a boat. On his way home he finds a cave filled with gems. He grabs a few and runs home. when he gets there he is praised by his family and is feed well. Content, he falls asleep.It's a great book. Perfect for young readers such as my little sister. A very interesting thing to read, but it's not wonderful for older readers such as myself who prefer a little more drama."
3,DeWalt Batteries,"The 18v DeWalt drill is solidly built, but the batteries do not last very long. I have purchased 3 or 4 replacement battery sets, including Top Cell, but they didn't even last as long as the original DeWalts. Two DeWalt branded batteries at Home Depot cost more than a new drill ($90 each) so repalcement DeWalt batteries are just a big rip off. If you open up any 18 v battery you will find that it is just made of 15 ""C"" cells which are only worth a couple of bucks each. Save your money and buy a new drill with Lithium Ion batteries. Incidentally, I also have a 12 V Makita drill and the Makita batteries last 3 or 4 times longer than DeWalt or Top Cell."
1,Poor fit,Poor fitting battery. Never held a charge very long and died a painful death. Will stick to DeWalt from now on.
3,Very similar to the source for Benny Lava,"This movie has the same stars as the youtube viral video ""Benny Lava"" by Mike Sutton (youtube user Buffalax). Prabhu Deva, the male lead, is considered the ""Michael Jackson of Bollywood"". It's got similar fast and catchy dance numbers -- and would be great for ""buffalaxing"" or ""soramimi"", which is translating a foreign language based upon what you think you hear in English regardless of the actual language. As far as I can find (2/2009), the original movie, ""Pennin Manathai Thottu"", and song, ""Kalluri Vaanil"", are not available on dvd at this time. Lets hope that the distributor gets it transferred to DVD soon! I would love to have a copy.The DVD transfer has quite a bit of snow and other static with occassional heavy pixelation. Looks like a direct VHS to DVD with little cleanup. Sound is OK. There are English subtitles for those who want to know what they are really saying. There is also a special feature to show only the songs sections of the movie."
3,Audio review,This is interesting and fast moving. But any Audio listener it's only one CD. Wish Amazon would list how many cd's in each audio book description.
5,important series,"I listened to this series with a group of people interested in the contemplative journey within the Christian tradition. There were about eight of us, and everyone, without exception, loved it. James Finley is a guide to the essence of the Christian contemplative experience. His presentation style is quiet, intending to evoke the contemplative stance.He speaks with the authority of someone who has been there, done that, not just read about it."
2,Only For the Seriously Obsessed,"I looked forward to reading this book, and like one reviewer, looked forward to a pleasant evening of reading. This book is painfully researched and definitely not an enjoyable read. I have no doubt the author knows what he is writing about, but unless you are really an Earp fanatic, you will not enjoy a pleasant read about a colorful western persona. The book would have been much more enjoyable if the author had presented his version of the history of Wyatt Earp first. It was very distracting with the constant reporting of descrepancies he found in other texts in every chapter, and at least for novices, would have been appreciated at the end of the book as a summary of research."
5,The most definitive work I've found on the subject,"Mr. Erwin's book becomes almost tedious when one tries to plow through all the documentation and disparities surrounding the many versions of the story. But, with patience and attention, the true story comes to light, blowing most of the others out of the water."
1,"A Catalog, Not a Biography","Any bright High School kid could have compiled this book as Richard Erwin obviously did, by taking snippets of everything previously written on his subject (unless it didn't prove his pre-selected conclusions) and pasting them onto the page with his own, not too well-informed opinions, added. Nothing new. Much erroneous. A typographical nightmare of misspellings and erroneous words. Save your money."
5,Had for 8 years with no problem for 99% of the time.,What can I say besides that I have had this for 8 years with little to no problems. The only problem I had was trying to configure it to allow a Nintendo DSi to connect wirelessly to it. I am still using this router currently.Update Dec 2010:Wireless did finally give out and only worked 2 inches from the router. Finally had to replace.
2,"no CD-ROM, book in very poor condition","The book never came with a CD-ROM as specified in the title. Further, the book was severely damaged at the spine and pages are coming out. There are marks on many of the pages. If I didn't require this book for class, I would have demanded my money back. As a note for this book, the author uses negative going clock edges to trigger logic."
5,"Great book: excellent text, examples","While this book is designed as a self-paced textbook, Dr. Roth takes great care in explaining the fundamentals of logic design in relevant detail with an excellent use of examples. This is perhaps one of the easiest textbooks to read, and does not contain long, boring material. Study guides and review questions help you understand the material even further, following up on what you have read in each unit. This is a book that's definitely worth keeping, as it can also be used as a valuable reference that can be used year after year."
3,Not For Beginners,"I purchased Fundamentals of Logic Design to use in conjunction with a Digital Logic class. This book assumes that you understand every concept you encounter before moving to the next section. Near the end of the text, it is assumed that you are taking in outside knowledge while using this text.Many of the images used throughout the text are difficult to read - even in conjunction with the captions."
5,This is a good book for starters in logic,It describes the basic types of fallacies. It is a good book for training brains. What I have read is a much older version. I am expecting the new one will be even better.
1,My Check Writer Business Premium,This product only works with HP LaserJet Printers with a Special Ink Cartridge. It is a total waste of money otherwise. I wish that had been made clear in the description.
3,Baby Einstein Baby Monet Crib Toy,"The toy is okay, nice music, nice sound effects. Baby likes the lights and bright pictures. The downside is that you have to mount it on the top of the rail, which means that the toy isn't interactive until your child can reach it easily - when they turn their attention to other things quite quickly."
5,Awesome book!!,I am 8 years old and in 2nd grade. This was my favorite Scooby Doo book so far. It was very exciting and scary. It made me want to keep reading to finish the book. I liked it so much I finished it in 2 days.
1,Im really sad with this book!,"It said this book is for C++ with OpenGL,Its not that you think!, I thought was in Ansi C++. This is using MFC. The Library seems its a good wrapper of OpenGL and the book its interesting but im complane that nobody told me is using MFC , also the description of the book and the sypnosis doesnt post that, so i think people think is with ansi C++!. anyway i have no chance to use this book cause i dont use MFC."
2,Good concepts but poor portability testing,"This book has great promise. Unfortunately, it was not tested on a variety of platforms for ease of building. I installed it on my NT box, and no executables were provided, just source. I installed it on my Linux box, hoping that building there would be much more straightforward. The makefile and build process is very poor. The ZIP file in the UNIX directory on the CD-ROM all has dos-format files in it (^M on every line) which messes up the EGCS compiler. I'm having to edit a great number of files to get anything to compile. I'm persevering because it has some cool ideas in it. But if they could have taken the time to write better build scripts and makefiles for a variety of platforms, I could rate the book better. This book could have been excellent but fails in its CD-ROM delivery."
1,A Waste of Paper,"The title of this review says it all. I'm hard pressed to think of any arena in which this boook might server some purpose other than book-end. Too small for a boat anchor...This book is not about OpenGL programming. It's about the authors highly specific, extremely limited system for rendering a small set of surfaces described by mathematical expressions. Don't make the mistake of thinking that the author has developed a general purpose surface rendering-graphing system. He hasn't. Likewise, don't make the mistake of thinking this is some open-ended system that can be extended to a general-purpose (read 'useful') rendering/graphing system. It is too limited to be a useful graphics/mathematical tool, and it certainly isn't going to teach anyone anything about OpenGL."
4,Happy Holiday,"This book is stunning. It is over the top and took a few glances before I really could absorb its beauty. I so fell in love with it, that I designed my own Tiffany Table for Christmas. My mom is elderly and not quite use to this holiday decorating approach. Initially she didn't know what to make of it, but eventually fell in love with it and would call me to come turn on the lights so that she could view it from the next room where she usually sits. I can hardly wait to do it again next year. Great book!"
2,I want to cry!,"I have owned a Sony 8mm camcorder for 6 years,and i decided to get a digital one.This product is not a good buy.It is sharp and clear if you playback the tape on your LCD.When you play on your tv with a S-video cord,its quality is like a vcr tape.The worst of all is when you shoot the video,of course,with the stabilization fuction on,the pictures become blurred when you move,and when you playback the tape, the pictures are also blurred.The pictures of my 8mm is better than this digital one when i playback the tape.Think before you buy this product."
3,Mac users beware!,"Several reviews of this camcorder mention that it works with Macintosh computers, and based on those reviews, my wife bought it for me. However, I've been unable to get my software (iMovie, OS 10.1.5) to detect the existence of the camcorder on its Firewire cable. Whether the problem lies with my computer, my software, or the camcorder, I don't know. But when I called Samsung technical support about it, their response was: ""Samsung does not support the use of this camcorder with Macintosh computers."" Gee, thanks a lot!"
3,Good If you don't mind that the date/time keeps on reseting.,"This is a nice camcorder for the money if you dont mind the Date/Time always reseting. I returned the first one because of this problem and guess what! The replacement did the same thing. I contacted Samsung and all they would say was that I had to send it to their service center. Forget it! I just got this thing now Ive got to wait for them to fix it. I think not. I returned the replacement as well and bought a Canon ZR40 for ...more. I love it. Im happy I did. Overall though, Its nice camcorder barring the problems I outlined."
4,Great camcorder at a great price,"... this is truly the best digital camcorder. It has 23x optical zoom, which is much more than the typical 10x or 16x zoom. The picture quality is excellent and the sound is also great. However, the battery that comes with it lasts about one hour only (with the lcd on). So, you might want to buy an extra battery if you're going to use it for extended time. Also, it can't record well in low light. So, make sure there's adequate light when you're recording indoor. But overall it's a great deal."
5,the best deal,"I just love shopping at Amazon because they are very good in delivering the order very promptly. I think this is the best thing anyone can get with this amount of money. I got this 10 days ago. You won't regret this purchase. If you want to find out how things work, just plug in the camcorder and watch the demo. It is so cool!!! The picture quality is fantastic. The functions are simple enough that anyone can execute the tasks. It's light and fits right into one's hand. A good grip. The viewfinder is nice too. Good job Samsung"
1,Samsung is a dishonor to Korea,"I thought they made great products but this one breaks the mold!! I bought it on 2002 and it worked fine until the warranty ended. The video is worse than my old VHS cam (there are blocks in the picture). Yes, I've cleaned the heads! The sound is non-existent. Yes, I've checked the connections. Then, he mummbled something in Korean, laughing something in Korean. (This American probably forgot to plug in the power cord.) Suprise!! I understand it. I hanged up on him and bought myself a Canon."
1,Worst Camcorder Ever,"I bought this cam due to the great price 20 days ago. Upon testing it out at home, I found artifacts floating all over the screen. The time and date imprint kept on resetting by itself. Lcd has bad spots on it. If using the image stabilizer, the image will roll quite a bit upon capturing through firewire so beware. Image quality is the worst ever for a digital cam. I had better pic quality from my old panasonic vhs-c cam. Time and date also vanished when capturing to PC via firewire with aist digital movie suite. I am returning this product and buying a Sony TRV 27 even if I have to pay a bit extra. Heard great review for that model. Save yourselves the frustration and buy Canon, Pana, or Sony!!!"
4,A great two-in-one camera,"I actually originally purchased a JVC digital camcorder. I should have listened to the other Amazon reviewers and steered clear of that one, as within an hour of use, it stated that it needed head cleaning, and wouldn't operate.This Samsung camcorder replaced that one the day after I purchased the JVC, and I am very pleased. The picture and sound quality are great, and it is very easy to download the video to my iMac via firewire. I'm not sure how well (or if) it would work on a PC, so you may want to investigate whether it will work with your system.About the only thing that keeps this camera from getting 5 stars is I have had difficulty trying to retrieve still photos when the camera is connected to the computer- but then I haven't fully read the manual, so it could be very simple.Basically this is a great camera, and it's not much more expensive than a high-quality digital still camera. If you enjoy having multiple-use products as much as I do, this is a great bet."
2,Save yourself the grief and pick another brand,"I'd carefully researcged miniDV camcorders and picked the Samsung because of the price and features (quite a lot for not much $). I'd also read the reviews and figured that most people were satisfied with theirs and thought it unlikely that I'd get a dud.Well, only about a month after we got ours, the ""play"" function stopped working -- and I found that no one in LA will service the Samsung under warranty. So I sent it back to Samsung's main service center -- it took about a month (and two phone calls) to get it back -- and it STILL doesn't work. It doesn't look like they did anything to it (aside from the new scratch that wasn't there before). I am sending it back, and we'll see what happens this time.But save yourself the trouble and spend a little more for a better-known brand!"
1,Doesn't work with a Mac and phone support was poor,"After downloading the manual from the Samsung web site and seeing that it support the Mac OS I decided to try this camera. The camera specs are great but I had problems with the camera. First off, it has a real SLOW focus and there were times the system picked up on foreground objects and tried to focus on them. Not a bad thing but it takes about 3-5 seconds for objects to come into focus.The second problem is the IEEE-1394 port does not work with the Macintosh. After 4 calls to Samsung tech support I got the promised call back about Macintosh compatibility. They recommended a few windows programs for the data import. The 5 call into them they admitted the SCD67 did not work with a Macintosh. If you plan to use this camera with iMovie or Final Cut Pro get a different camera. The applications can not even see the camera. I tried 4 or 5 other IEEE-1394 capture applications on the Mac and none could pull data from the camera."
1,Broken After 3rd Tape,"The power switch broke after 180 minutes of video. I am unable to turn the camcorder off. It's the switch that goes from, ""camera-off-player"". In the official review, it notes that the switch is flimsy. I should have listened.In addition my camera has problems keeping date/time settings. It will revert back to Jan 1, 2001 often. During the use of the camera with the first 3 tapes, I've had to reset the date/time over 15 times."
1,Don't buy this camera!,"I bought this from a local store and have had nothing but trouble from day 1. Like most complaints, my date is reset everytime I turn it on. Then, it started eating my tapes (which are expensive). Final straw, started getting lines in playback mode. Now it's to the point where playback is not working. I don't know if my kids memories are gone forever or if I can play the tapes on some other device.the local store and Samsung are basically telling me that I'm on my own. It sucks, $... down the drain and lost memories forever.DON""T BUY IT!"
1,"Awful camera, awful customer service","This embarassment of a camera is the worst mistake of my consumer-life. It was broken out of the box. Ok, that I can understand.. happens to every manufacturer. So I took it to a so-called Samsung Certified Service Center who kept it for THREE MONTHS before giving me a new one. The new camera's picture quality quickly deteriorated until the images became unwatchable. Samsung's customer service amounted to, ""You're lying and it's not my problem."" Horrible, awful camera. Stay away at all costs from any Samsung product. If you've had luck with them in the past, pray you stay lucky because if something ever goes wrong they will burn you every chance they get."
1,do not buy this camera,"this camera is not compatible with a mac. it says it is on their website and in their owner's manual, but once it is at home, it won't work. i have contacted samsung three times, and have had little or no help. a manager was supposed to call me back (this after I had sent the camera off to be worked on) but i still have not heard from anyone. and that's been over two months. i am tired of trying. this camera is ok at filming, but does not work when trying to edit on a mac. save your money and buy another brand!!"
4,Great review of GMPLS,"I give this book 4 out of 5 stars because of its age. 2006, and its nearly 2010. With advancement in this protocol and the advent of GMPLS/GELS for ethernet control plane for Carrier Ethernet this books screams for a 2nd edition (even if in PDF format only). And perhaps a chapter giving a run down of GMPLS implementations by major vendors. Both those that supply network nodes and a control server, and those that build the control plane server only (like Soap Stone until Extreme Networks bought them)."
4,GMPLS - Architecture and Applications,I am suprise with this book. The authors use a clear language and explore very well all the concepts about GMPLS. It is a very important book for wich are developing projects in this area.
5,Extraordinario para nenes de 4 a 13 a√±os,"cuando las tormentas rugen por el cielo, suena el trueno, alumbra el rel√°mpado y el rayo ilumina el cielo, es NATURAL que nuestros ni√±os se asustent ante la demostraci√≥n de poder de La Naturaleza...

5,I TOLD MYSELF I BELONG TO A COUNTRY,OF HEROES AND WARRIORS...But cried like a little girl when the sotrm thundered and was VERY ASHAMED OF MYSELF...I bought this book with my own savings...and you know what?}NOW I'M READY TO GO TO WARD AND TO FACE STORMS !!
2,Irritates my skin,"I've been looking for something to help with my flaky skin on parts of my face where my Eczema flares up. This not only made my eczema flare back up, but it also made my skin more dry with more flakes. If you have really sensitive skin,(allergy prone) don't get this. My guess is the fragrance caused it."
3,good mix .. but weird Tubthumping mix,"this is a good cd .... great to have ""Pepper"", ""Santa Monica"", and ""Naked Eye"" on one cd ... but be forewarned .... the ""Tubthumping"" version on this cd is bizarre, not the version heard on radio"
5,This Book Is One Of The Best!,I have the whole Jenny McGrady series and this one is one of the best out of all ten. I have read it around four times and it still never gets boring!
5,Amazing Amazon.,I wanted to know how much more capacity the subject battery would have over my existing one.The item arrived within a very reasonable time and in excellent condition and was pleasantly surprised at how much more capacity it had over the old battery.I have ordered several other items from Amazon.com in the past and their service is awesome. Always on time and product was always in excellent condition. I would recemmend this service to anyone.
4,It worked till it didn't anymore.,"I used these batteries till I couldn't any longer. it has been 3 years it finally died on me. This HXP model has a fan that lets the battery charge faster by forcing cool air on it to keep it from getting hot. Yeah it's nice that they charge faster than my other batteries but now these are dead, and my classic batteries still work, for only 15 minutes of good use, but at least they work, keeping me from spending hundreds of dollars on new batteries again. The choice is yours, fast & now, broke a few years later, or slow and steady for years to come. I'm happy with how long it lasted, since I expected they wouldn't outlast the ones I already owned. Also these are much lighter than the older model, a plus, but the lack of heavy strong components are the downfall as well. Instead, they should make a heavy slow charge battery with fan, so we would never have to buy batteries ever again."
3,Losing Patience with Hitachi,"Hitachi makes great power tools but they keep switching the batteries around and you have to buy very expensive new ones if an old one goes bad. I was dormant for a while and took mine off the charger and they mostly went bad over about 16 months, but running the charger all that time is an energy drain. My last purchase was a power tool with a cord--made by another company.Maybe I did something wrong taking them off the charger, but it sharply reduced my enthusiasm for an otherwise very satisfying brand with good design."
2,Poor,Bias writing. Was not accurate in much of his portrayal. I knew some of the people in the book. This was not a fair description of the entire time frame and effect on law-abiding citizens.
5,VERY INFOMRMATIVE,"I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE VERY INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL. I WISH THAT I COULD HAVE HAD THIS BOOK BEFORE THE BREAKUP OF MY MARRIAGE. I WILL SEND IT TO MY EX-HUSBAND, HE NEEDS TO READ THIS TOO. I AM SURE THAT MOST COUPLES COULD BENEFIT FROM READING THIS BOOK TOGETHER."
3,Complete RIPOFF!!!,My neice REALLY wanted this for Christmas so I went on-line and bought it for her from Amazon. I'm sorry but I got this little toy and felt completely ripped off. I have bought Bratz for years for my daughter and all her friends so I know for a fact this was a $10 doll not a $30 doll like Amazon is charging. I went shopping and found the same dolls at Walmart for $10.44........1/3 the cost. I bought my neice 3 of them and am returning the Amazon one. Amazon needs to take a look at this doll again and realize it is over priced. Thanks!
5,Inspiring book on the power of the Gospel,One of the best books I have read to introduce people to the power of the Biblical gospel and the meaning of the cross. This is truth that will transform lives.
1,bad,this is the worst album of 2000-2010. I'd rather melt my brain than listen to this music. Weezer are such a terrible band; they should hit the abort switch and move to arkansas.ps - keep fishin' for a better cd.
4,Great Album By The Duo - Dillinja and Lemon D,"Lemon D and Dillinja make a great DnB album together on their Valve Record label. Dillinja, as always, comes with his up-in-your-face driving bass lines, and Lemon D comes with a more melodic approach to production.What is great about this CD is it comes with mixed and unmixed versions of the songs/tracks, which you don't get if you have bought the Killa Hertz album on vinyl; and you also get a bonus DVD as well. Now you can finally see the infamous Valve soundsystem, if you haven't seen it live.A good album with many good tracks, even though some may be a little too repetitive after hearing it numerous times -- like Program One.Overall, a good investment."
3,"A Little disappointed, a little pleased","Bird on a wire, was not as advertised. The disc said it was wide screen, 2.35:1, even on the disc, but it was not. There was a little box in the middle of my screen with black all around it. I had to stretch it real wide, and then settle for the BIG black bars on the top and bottom. I don't call that wide screen.Cowboy Way was great. It was full aspect, 1.85:1, which covered the complete screen. I really enjoy that film, even if I am not a Harrelson fan. If it wasn't for that, I would send it back."
5,A good start for little ones.,I appreciate this books God centered approach to the question stated in the title. I have read it to both my boys (2 & 3). They enjoy the pictures and the dialogue between the mother and her child. I enjoy not having to edit out anything not quite appropriate for children their age. The best I have seen for this age group.
4,Great unit but WEAK volume,"Had to upgrade to the 60Cx from the 60CS due to the larger map file sizes discovered after upgrading to the new City Navigator North America version 8 software. Aside from having to buy a new unit, the 60Cx has a very weak alert tone volume. I rely on the tones to alert me to an upcoming route change, but the volume of the tones is so low, that if you have the stereo on, or are talking on a cell phone, you might not hear the tone. You'd think that Garmin could put a decent speaker in the unit and provide some way to increase or decrease the volume output. Believe it or not the volume of the 60CS was louder than the 60Cx, although still way too weak.This unit smokes, but it's getting only 4 stars from me because Garmin has failed to improve this feature, or lack thereof."
2,difficult to use,"difficult to use, screens are not user friendly, navigating information not usable the screen does not lend itself to usage while driving on bumpy trail.I would seriously look at other options. 2 stars because of durability. take paper maps with you."
1,Not What I Expected From Garmin,"Having owned 2 automotive GPS units from Garmin I ventured into a handheld unit for hiking, etc. The unit looked like it was very well constructed and made from high quality materials. I had the unit up and running in no time. It did take nearly 60 seconds for it to discover enough satelites in order to determine its location. (This was outside with no obstructions) The unit performed OK for the first 24 hours. It does leave a lot to be desired without maps. I really don't understand why Garmim doesn't include them.The next day I decided to install City NT maps to test its performance in the car. While installing the map software the unit died. It powered off and would not come back on. I tried different batteries to no avail. I decided to box it up and return to Amazon. I really didn't have the time to deal with a defective product. I am going to look at the Oregon series GPS in hopes that I will have better luck there."
4,Garmin GPSMap 60Cx Handheld GPS Navigator,"The Good1) Found the GPS works well.2) It is quick and has a nice and useful set of features.3) The interface is easy to use and learn4) Loading the software (MapSource) was easy and the GPS interfaced with my PC with no hitch5) Transferring data between the GPS and PC was easy and effective.6) I particularly like the large screen and the large fonts and this was why I bought this unit7) On the whole I am pleased with my purchaseThe Bad1) MapSource, the software supplied with the GPS did have a glitch with upgrading from the internet. Each time I tried to upgrade the software, a fatal error occurred. Garmin could not assist unless I telephoned a Garmin technician. This remains a problem.2) Purchasing road map data for South Africa has proved to be very expensive."
2,Great piece of technology.... poor map support,"This purchase was to update an older Magellan Map 330. I was excited to see the device and quickly found it easy to use. I purchased the Garmin MapSource 2008 and then disapointment set in. After loading a section of the local topo map, i went out of the house to test it. It had my location almost 200 feet to the north of my house with 8 stations in view. A driving test had me as much as three streets off at times. I would stop the car and check outside and the error remanined. A Dolorme LT-20 with a laptop on the car seat was dead on. After comparing a friends 60Cx, he had the same problem. It's a shame that Garmin does all this development and then provides such inaccurate maps. It is sitting in the glove box for emergency use only to determine north and south.... pitty..."
1,"No maps, support keeps bankers hours","I was really looking forward to using this product on my dual sport bike, but found it nearly impossible to set up. Big gaps in information in the manual, online help, and cd. Also expect to spend another 130 for maps as nothing is included and the chip that comes w it won't download the street maps I purchased from Garmin. Oh, and no support on weekends!"
4,Garmin 60Cx from Amazon - undocumented feature,"I don't know how about others, but this one Garmin 60Cx purchased from Amazon in difference of its description contains a 1 GB microSD card! Very pleasant :)"
4,"Used in Moab, UT","The base maps are a problem, for me. I needed the topo maps and the city nav to make the most of this unit. It's very reliable and powerful."
4,Very Pleased,"I bought this GPS strictly for navigation on a snowmobile throughout the public trail system in the Midwest. I am a COMPLETE novice when it comes to any type of new technology, especially handheld (big hands, slow brain). I am very impressed with the ease of use on this Garmin unit. The product is a perfect combination of feature rich and reasonable value. I would highly suggest this unit for any ""outdoor nut""."
5,great seller,transaction went very smoothly and the seller was great at resolving a problem with the item
1,review,"My husband bought this to take with him to afghanistan. However, the downloadable map for afghanistan is only available from one website...and the website is a piece of s**t."
4,What sensitivity!,"I can get satellite lock in deep forests and in my house and places where my old Etrex Vista could not. The displays are crystle clear and easy to see in all conditions. The user interface is good compared to other GPS units I have owned but could be designed more intuitively. The device makes calculations fast. I bought North American City mapsource and they work well together. I intend to use the device for hiking and the topographic map intended to be loaded into the 60cx does not have sufficient resolution. I carry 1 to 24,000 resolution maps from Maptech set in 3d mode. I load the appropriate waypoints from this maping software into the 60CX.If I were buying now I would certainly look at the Garmin Etrex Vista cxh. It has the same resolution display as the 60Cx, has the same chipset, weighs less, and goes longer on a battery. It's a hundred dollars cheaper."
4,Good buy.,"What I like about it...It finds satellites quickly.It shows accuracy to within 9 feet.It was way cheaper than most mapping handhelds.***best feature***It is easy to read in most all light conditions.The dispaly is large enough and the unit is small enough.It has more than enough available information for me.It's easy to add waypoints by inputting coordinates.It shows lake shores and islands pretty accurately with the optional map program, works great on a boat.I'd give it 4.5 stars.What I don't like...The base map that comes with the unit is only useful for off road use (hiking, hunting, etc.) I knew this going in and purchased the Garmin ""Lower 49"" road map. This also required the purchase of larger capacity MicroSD chip."
4,Heavy duty,These mats are heavy duty and seem to be made well. There are ridges on the ends to help if it needs to be cut to size. I got 3 for my mini-van and am very happy with them.
3,"Heavy rubber, lightweight carpet","I was surprised by the excellent reviews of this item. The carpet is very thin, far thinner than any other floor mat I've ever seen. The rubber is heavy enough to keep it down though, and if you are in need of a runner for your vehicle, there are very few choices around. I was happy with the price and availability on Amazon, but don't expect this to look right in your luxury vehicle."
2,As a fan of the Susan Henshaw mysteries...,"....I found this one to be my least favorite. Mostly, it was just annoying. By the middle of the book I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters. The story was sort of muddled with odd useless stuff, like the cryptic messages from the person suspected of the murder, to the behavior of the suspected murderer's wife. Even Susan and Jed weren't particularly likeable. All in all, not Valerie Wolzien's best work."
4,death takes a holiday?,"Not the classic movie, but an enjoyable mystery. What I truly enjoyed is that I got this book in a grouping of mysteries. I read it and didn't even realize it was the eighth book from the writer with this character. The book was good enough to stand on it's own without having to read all the others first. It was so good I will just have to check out the other books, not something I could say for everything I have been reading lately."
4,Good begining reference,Good hiking reference if you're new to the BH and hiking in general. I've found the ratings to be more for beginners or folks without a lot of hiking skill (ie. a moderate trail listed as strenuous). Good to get you oriented to the area.
2,First time I've ever been disappointed in a Falcon Guide,"I go on an annual hiking trip with a group of buddies. We almost always rely on Falcon Guides for hike planning, and this year being my year to plan the logistics, I purchased the guide for the Black Hills and Badlands for our five hikes.We found that the distances for virtually all the hikes we did were very far off (miles off, including our longest hike, the Lost Cabin/Harney Peak loop, which was listed in the guide as 8.6 miles but by the count of two different GPS readings was 12.4), and one of the hikes was rated easy when it included several fairly significant climbs. Most disappointing, however, was the fact that one description, that for the Bear Mountain loop, was wholly inadequate/inaccurate, including simply incorrectly describing the trailhead at the boy scout camp, which after 90 minutes of all 6 of us spreading out and searching we simply never found.Very disappointing."
3,Better just to use the internet,I've been hiking and camping for over 40 years. I always research the area before any trip. I had hoped this book would help in planning. It was very weak on trail description.I got more information from just looking through the internet.
2,Missing parts.,My 9-piece scroll chuck system set is only a 7 piece set. The 2 Tightening Levers were not in the box. The box was sealed. Nothing in my shop fits the holes in the chuck for the tightening levers. Therefore i've yet to use it as i'm 50 mi. from a hardware store.
4,Great chuck for the price,"I have four chucks that I use steady, one Nova and three Barracudas I prefer the Barracuas and prefer those with the bars over the key adjustment."
4,wood lathe enhancement,"I've owned my 9"" dunlop wood lathe for as long as I can remember. Having turned bowls, candle sticks, lamps etc. Using the Barracuda Chuck System, I've graduated to the world of today in lathe use (short of an NC wood lathe).I highly reccommend it for any one interested in improving his or her lathe expertise. It alleviates the time spent crosscutting the piece for use in the attachment to the drive spindle of the lathe and allows for a safer grasp on any operation not using the tail stock"
3,Not bad (Not great),"The chuck is fine for an entry level/budget chuck. I'm disappointed with how poorly it centers work pieces however. I find that I have to make a pass to ""true-up"" the surface every time I rechuck. Not the end of the world so far but a nuisance nonetheless."
4,lathe chuck,I like the chuck alot and have used it quite a bit. The only negative part is that the screw holes for attaching a Longworth chuck do not match. All the other chucks I've looked at seem to be bored the same. However if you compare the price difference its hard to dislike it.
5,Candle holder Christmas gift,"The chuck worked perfectly for my first ever candle holder lathe project.Although not perfectly matched, they were greatly appreciated by my girl friend."
1,Catastrophic failure of chuck,"I purchased this product a year ago and this December it broke sending the #4 jaw into my lathe bed and cracking it beyond repair. It had worked OK prior to the failure. Be wary of this product in use, it can fail suddenly and with out warning. I was doing the final sanding at low speed on a 9"" diameter platter when the jaw let loose.The product has been returned to PSI, but as I purchased it through Amazon, they have been reluctant to do anything other than say they ""may (Our warranty policy calls for a repair or replacement of any of our defective equipment. )"" send me a replacement. If that is what they do, it will end up on E-Bay Craig's List as I won't use their product again."
1,Save your money!,"He has the idea (The Symptomatic Thought Process) but no idea on how to implement it. This book is repetitive and repeats nothing over and over again. I'll repeat this, ""Save your money""!"
5,Susy's salt & pepper CD,Susy Dorn does a wonderful job..My granddaughter has been in her class for over a year. She started when she was years old. The class is fun and all Spanish. Go buy the DVD...
5,This is my son's favorite of the Susy CDs,"Susy's 2nd CD is more muscially soophisticated than her earlier CD, and is still a fabulous learning tool. My son's favorite song was ""Pelotas"" (balls) which he actually insited we listen to the song for 90 minutes straight when he was about 16 mos old. I think of Susy's first 3 CDs, this is the best one at teaching an adult with a small amount of exposure some basic application of the lanugage. (My mother-in-law was very impressed when I talked about a duck quacking in Spanish! I've bought this CD as gifts for many of my friends, whether their kids were learning Spanish or not."
4,One of his best!,"I love books about books so Dunning is right up my alley. I've read his previous two books and enjoyed them so when I got ""The Bookmans Promise"" I was expecting another good read. I got that and more! Kept me spellbound trying to figure it out (and I'm usually pretty good at that!). I was so caught up in the story and changing scenes that the ending came as a total surprise. Love the history and it truly made me want to do more research on the subject. This had more heart and twists than the previous two and is definitely worth reading. I may do it again!"
3,So who said he should write a story,"John Dunning swapped the insider details of the book collector's world that peppered his first two Janeway novels (compiled inBOOKED TWICE) for an actual plot. Fortunately, it almost makes up for the lapse in the curriculum. The notion that the explorer Sir Richard Burton may have been more than an observer during his (historical) sojourn in U.S. just before the Civil War kinda tickles the fancy. But next time, Dunning... next time there better be more lessons."
3,Maybe 3 1/2 stars,"This kept my interest. You've got Janeway doing his thing as you'd expect. Though ""Bookman's Wake"" is my favorite Janeway story, this one has its moments. I especially liked the descriptions of Charleston, SC as I used to live there. The use of Richard Burton (the explorer) was what most kept me involved here. I even picked up something from Dunning's suggested reading list at the end."
3,dissapointed,"Really enjoyed the first 2 Jameway books a lot!!This latest story was not up to snuff. I could see no reason at all for the Burton fling in the south, and I wanted it to work!The Dante character seemed to clown like for Dunnings quality of wrtting."
2,Does Dunning know what is or isn't supernatural?,"I'm about 3/4 way thru this book (Bookman's Promise), Coco keeps saying she doesn't believe in the supernatural but surely seems to be affected by spirits & talks about ghosts. In my dictionary, both of these are considered supernatural...I agree with the others that Dunning has not come thru with this book. To listen (I have the audio) to the tapes of the conversation(s) of 2 dead people thru the old lady (isn't that rather supernatural?) is pretty boring & really makes for dull reading, I'm sure.I will finish the book, mainly because I've read later segments of Janeway's career & want to understand the pairing of Cliff & Erin. But it is a disappointment...don't recommend anyone else reading it."
1,bookselling interest hides hack writing?,"I haven't read the first two Janeways but if this is how Dunning writes I can't imagine they'd be much better. His characters are two-dimensional and his prose style is laden with cliche. I was actually listening to an audiobook of it read by a man I know to be an excellent reader, and a good reader can make a book even better than it really is. Nevertheless I had to give this one up about a third of the way through. My eyes were getting sore from wincing every few lines..."
4,A definite bargain,"The recordings are obviously not the greatest on the market - Tennstedt certainly can't match Karajan's version of the 5th. The 2nd is a little disappointing, I agree - this is my favourite of the lot, and Gilbert Kaplan's recording of this with the LSO is fairly earth-shattering. Notwithstanding, for the amazing price, this set is an excellent buy, and the playing is of a sufficiently high standard to please all but the most critical listeners. Unless you want to spend another $100, take this opportunity."
3,Better for Tennsted lovers than Mahler lovers,"Tennstedt was a fine conductor with an amazing personal history, and he has a particular voice with Mahler. There are tremendous moments here, but taken as a whole, the cycle tends to drift. A common problem with most of these performances is that the opening movements are stunning, some of the greatest you'll ever hear [the Sixth, for example], but then the playing and interpretation looses both energy and focus, leaving the listener a touch jejeune. The 8th is the highlight of this cycle, and it is wonderful, but as a whole, this is not a great set."
