5,A Truly Inspired Compilation of Today's Best Artists,"Coldplay, Zero 7, The Shins, Thievery Corporation - it doesn't get any better than this! Even if you missed the movie, you've got to pick up this CD! With all of the crappy soundtracks (and crappy movies) coming out these days, it's refreshing to find an album with such a diverse mix of original-sounding, truly talented artists!P.S. If this floats your boat, you should definitely check out the Wicker Park soundtrack, another excellent compilation featuring The Shins, Death Cab for Cutie and Postal Service."
5,good compilation,"I did enjoy the movie and the soundtrack is very much a catalogue of moments in the movie.Noteable Tracks:- The Shins: Caring is Creepy- Zero 7 - In the waiting line- Colin Hay - i just don't think i'll get over you- Cary Brothers - Blue Eyes- Remy Zero - Fair- Nick Drake - One Of These Things First- Frou Frou - Let Go- Bonnie Somerville - Winding Roadyes, i've mentioned more than half the album and yes, it's THAT GOOD!!!"
5,Best CD I have ever had.,"I have found this cd to be one of the best CD I own. It has opened a hole new world of music to me, it has shown me bands like, the shins, Colin hay (love him), simon & garfunkel, Frou Frou, and more. It also is a soundtrack of one of my fav movies Garden State directed by Zach Braff, and if you have the chance get both the CD and movie of Garden State"
5,"Amazing Movie, Great Music",I'm a music lover and one of the things I look for in a movie is the soundtrack. The music is very important because it could make a scene worth remembering. This was an awesome movie and the music really fit well into it. I give this movie 5 stars and the same rating for it's music counterpart.
5,an eye opener for the blind,"The only reason why you must buy this album is to listen what you have been missing all these years: frantic music performed by real artists. That beacuse most if not all these songs can be found in previous releases. In a collection that gives preference to The Shins, Nick Drake, Iron & Wine, Coldplay, and some other less welcome names, Zach Braff has (un)consciously built the soundtrack that will define the taste of millions of teenagers and adults used to listening to pre-recorded voices. Moments like these only happen sparsely in a decade (remember what Good will hunting did for the mighty Elliott Smith, or Morvern Callar for those underrated electronic bands) and should be treasured as unique gems. It is true, although, that the songs make more sense within the context of the movie, but as individual entities they could reach even deeper.Enjoy them and look at the state of the precious garden."
1,Dentist Music,"I suppose it's a tribute to Zach Braff's eye for scene and character that this lame music actually seemed pretty cool in Garden State. I remember it being very sweet and elegant and wonderful when I watched the movie.Yet upon buying the CD I'm mortified by the sheer tedium of the songs. It's not even one particular style, but many styles all conspiring to put the listener into a boredom-induced coma. Even ""Break Down"" by Frou Frou - which sounded so great in the trailers and the closing montage - sounds tired and worn. There's nothing else to that song and without the images of the movie in place, it falls.The rest of the pieces are odious. Coldplay isn't so bad on this particular CD, but Nick Drake, the Shins and Simon & Grafunkle work overtime to act all sentimental - so sentimental that you want to hit them on the heads with shovels and tell them to stop whining.This music has some good context, but hearing it without the movie just sours me."
4,Super CD!,"I had heard the Shins ""New Slang"" song on the radio recently, and after listening to cuts from the rest of this album on Amazon, had to have it. Currently my favorite music. Have yet to see the movie, but will soon."
4,Crime Scene DVD,"I bought this out of curiosity and am not disappointed.Its about investigating a crime scene where the students are given the task to do a forensic fact finding. As a viewer, you'll be drawn into making your own investigation & comparing your result against theirs.Its like reading a detective novel & trying to figure out who did it. Along the way , I learnt quite a bit about forensic science which may come in handy( God forbid)should I decide to engage in a brutal assult on my enemy Example: wash all weapons with bleach & the forensic scientist will not be able to find trace of blood.I would have given a 5 star if only this DVD contains more episodes."
4,Helpful resource,This book is a great tool for beginners there are handy lists of advice for beginners. It is well organized and is a great supplement in addition to the regular russian dictionary.
1,beginners my foot,"UNless you already know the cyrillic alphabet and can pronounce it, this book is quite useless. No pronunciation guides for hte words, only a page on how to pronounce the alphabet. I don't really see why it's a beginner's dictionary except maybe the words are bigger type. a waste. if you are a beginner try to find either a) a real dictionary for writing purposes or b) one with word-by- word pronunciation."
5,Great stuff,"The writer of this comic series really captures the teenage spirit of a kid gowing up in today's America. Funny, and entertaining."
5,"Funny, funny, funny.","This book is a hallarious compilation of previously published strips. I LOVE the Bermudez family, they are a great cast of characters with so much potential. There's just nothing else like it in syndication. I would reccomend this book to anyone who's interested in reading a funny, funny strip with a new perspective on everyday situations. Cantu and Castellanos do a wonderful job of bringing this family to life.The art is first rate, and among the best there is. I can't wait for the second book to be released."
1,Slowest service imaginable,"Can you imagine waiting for months for a tiny little package? If that is not a problem, then order this product from this seller. I ordered in October 2006 and in December I was emailed asking if it was okay if they delayed shipping until February 2007."
2,problem with problem solving,"I enjoyed the first video of this series and thought it very informative and useful, but I wasn't at all impressed with this one. It showed problems, but not much in the way of solutions. I thought it seemed hurried and superficial and would not recommend it."
1,Faulty - I would return if I could,Only held its charge once...... then dead with no recharge - maybe mine is only defective one..... who knows....
3,Love Hirt's..poor plant,I recently received my plant and I was very disappointed..yellow and brittle leaves..loaded with bugs and worms. I have recently transplanted into appropriate pot with trellis and seems to be recovering. Fast shipping..packaged well..will order again without hesitation. I have always received impeccable plants and products..unfortunately not this time.
5,Passion Flower vines purchased from Amazon shipped from Hirts Gardens,I was hesitant about ordering live plants by mail especially when shipped from a cold part of the country to Florida. Both the red and the purple passion vines arrived in perfect condition (had a heat pack inserted the the packing material) and the purple ones even had buds and has bloomed. I followed the directions to let it acclimate and have moved them to bigger pots and they are all thriving. I have had them at least a month now. I would not hesitate to order again.
4,great,"the item was in great shape. the material is very good, but it is much smaller than what it appears to be."
1,Terrible purchase,The first day I wore it one of the balls was lost. It must have fallen off during the day and I didn't notice. Now I cannot wear it anymore
4,Very Informative,A lot of information regarding the geography and history of the areas where my ancestors settled when they came to this country. Small details make reading very enjoyable.
2,Dissappointed,I searched every where for this product over the holidays. I had to wait until after the holidays to purchase this for my daughter. The advertisement made it seem so fun and easy to use. But in reality it's boring and a waste of money. I thought the child would be able to draw on the face and create a different look. It is really a tap and paste type deal. If the picture isn't in the correct spot the image will not turn out right. You have to also be in a very bright environment for the pic to show up. I just wasn't pleased and neither was my daughter. She has only played with it once and that was the day it arrived.
2,SOSO Camera Quality. Options limited.,"I returned this twic. Camera quality was not good. (Darker subjects will definatley have problems) The lips, etc are pre sulpted, and it is like pasting them over the face, and it does not line up. My almost 8 year old ws unimpressed, and we returned it and got something else."
2,Radica Digimakeover,Very disappointed. You cannot get a light-enough picture to enjoy playing with this product. It is very dark. My daughter has not touched it since Christmas day. It was a waste of money.
4,Radica Makeover Fun could use few minor improvements,"I bought this for my daughter, who is 11, for Christmas. She really enjoyed playing with it. She plays with it for hours. I thought it was fun too. The only things I would like to see would be a way to print or email the pictures. Also, the pictures you take are not as easy to edit if your pictures are not proportionate. The loaded pictures that come w/ the game are also fun to edit and they are a lot better looking than your own picture, but it is still fun and I would recommend it. It would be great for a sleepover w/ a bunch of girls. There are tons of hairstyles and other things to change. It is a good game!"
4,DIGI MAKEOVER IS COOL,"I really like using digi makeover on myself, my dog, my dolls, my mom & anything else that stands still long enough for me to take a picture of it. The only down side ;( is that there is not enough light on the subject when a picture is taken. I've been holding a flashlight on the subject to help with this problem and it works pretty well. Maybe a flash feature on the next upgrade would be good.Keep smiling!Laura"
4,Digi Makeover,This is a fun game for pre-teen children. Parents can enjoy this game with their daughters also. The only problem we have experienced is that it is hard to get the picture of your face the size of the diagram provided on the screen. I think any child in between the ages of 9 and 13 will enjoy this toy. It seems there are few toys out there for this particular age group.
5,A great gift,I gave the Digi Makeover to my Granddaughter for her birthday and she loved it. She said that it was her best present. The camera quality was very good and the product was easy to use
2,Not worth the big bucks!!,"This is definitely a great concept, but needs a lot more work. It's a pain for even adults to navigate through. Most of it is very cartoonish, not realistic. It usually doesn't even line up with the photo, no matter how much you try to move it around. I feel I got especially ripped off after paying extra to get it in time for the holidays.My opinion is wait for the new and improved model!!"
1,Big waste of money,"Believe the other reviews and save your money. There is no such thing as getting a good picture, which is critical to do the makeover...and the graphics are cartoonish. My daughter way way disappointed as was I...I spent alot more than I should have on this because she really wanted it. I'm not sure why anyone would give this product high marks."
3,CAN BE FUN,"MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN REQUESTING THIS TOY ALONG WITH A MILLION OTHER TOYS FOR THE PAST TWO CHRISTMAS. INSTEAD OF GETTING IT ON CHRISTMAS, SHE RECEIVED IT AS A REWARD FOR ALWAYS MAKING THE HONOR ROLL AT SCHOOL. SHE WAS SO EXCITED. SHE OPEN IT IMMEDIATELY AND BEGAN TAKING PICTURES OF HERSELF AND HER COUSINS. THE CAMERA TAKES A PICTURE OF THE PERSON AND THEY APPEAR ON THE T.V. YOU CAN ADD DIFFERENT HAIRSTYLE TO SEE HOW YOU LOOK. THE CONCEPT IS NICE BUT LIMITED. AFTER THIRTY MINUTES, MY DAUGHTER WAS BORED WITH IT. MY DAUGHTER IS TEN YEARS OLD AND IS GOOD WITH FIGURING THINGS OUT. IT ONLY TOOK HER THIRTY MINUTES TO DO EVERYTHING IT COULD DO."
1,"Hard to work, digital part is primitive","My kids got this for Christmas last year. It was difficult to get a decent picture from the camera. You have to set it up exactly the same size as the example. Picture came out grainy and dark. If you don't size it right the eyebrows can end up on your nose in the makeover, etc.The actual makeover part uses very simple and limited graphics. The girls got frustrated and lost interest. They were 10. They expect more from technology nowadays."
4,My daughter loves it!,"This was #1 on my daughter's Christmas list and I was worried that it wouldn't be as satisfying as she expected it to be, but she loves it. She has taken pictures of her uncles, the dog, the cat and her cabbage patch doll and given them all make-overs. The only complaint is that the picture quality, of course, is far from what they display in the ads. The pictures require a great deal of light and still come out rather grainy and dark. It's still worth it."
2,Disappointing for the price,"I bought this for my 7-year old daughter for Christmas. She saw it in a magazine and asked for it. I was skeptical based on the other reviews but I bought it anyway. The picture quality is very poor even after using bright lights. My daughter ended up just playing with the existing models that it comes with and seemed to be happy with that but for what I paid, this is a waste of money."
3,digi makeover,"We got this for our 9 yr old daughter for Christmas. Our expectations were pretty low. Just a silly toy for taking pictures of mom, dad, little brothers and friends and dressing them up in make up and radical hairstyles for a laugh. If you're looking for a makeover game that creates a realistic makeover, then this is not the game for you. It's also not the kind of game that's played with daily. But fun for a party of young girls, or evening with the fam. As others said, camera requires very good lighting to work well, makeup is difficult to apply,instructions are poorly written."
1,Stinks!,"I gave this to my daughter for Xmas and she told me then that she didn't like it, and it wound up in the closet. I finally remembered to get it down yesterday and play with it, so that I might interest her in it.The camera is pathetic to start with. It takes a lousy picture.Then, you apply lips and hair over top of your face. It's awful.A million times awful. I have never purchased a product this bad.I cannot believe these people who post good reviews and haven't even opened the product yet.Don't buy.We bought Bratz Girls playstation game and my daughter really loved that. She's 11. I would've given this a zero star if there was one."
1,False Advertisement,"This product does not perform NEARLY as well as it is advertised. The makeovers given to the 'models' look ok, but the makeovers given to yourself (or anyone you take a picture of) look ridiculous. The makeup looks like it is painted on and does not line up properly with the facial features. Also, the hair does not even fit the face of the picture. Basically, you end up looking like a circus clown when you do your own makeover. Two thumbs down...I can't believe the hype this toy got."
1,Disappointed,"This was the #1 toy my daughter wanted for xmas. I bought it, which was not cheap. She was disappointed that it was so far from what the advertisement portrays this as. The picture quality is very dark and hard to center. The tools that you can actually do to create the makeover is VERY limited. She played with it once and wants me to sell it. ;("
2,Very Disappointing,"I bought this for my daughter this Christmas and we were so disappointed with it. The main problem is that the camera takes awful, dark, grainy pictures. After several tries and lots of added light her features were still difficult to see on the tv screen. We still tried to do a makeover but, in addition to not being able to make out the subject, the makeover items were kind of boring. I was hoping there would be a way to import our own photos but didn't see a way to do it. I don't know how this product got so many good reviews (which I relied on when I reluctantly made this expensive purchase). If you decide to buy this item, be sure to hold on to your receipt and the packaging. BTW, I had also bought the same company's (Radica's) ""Designer's World"" game this Christmas and it turned out to be much more fun and was much, much less expensive."
4,Digi-Do-Over,"I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT. I have had lots of fun with it, but it could be easier to use. I had some trouble working the controls and getting it to do what i wanted."
3,Um not what I thought,I found this film entertaining but lacking in the story. I thought with all that talent this would be a better film.
2,"A very boring, silly film","Kirk Douglas' performance is probably the only worthwile thing in this boring, predictable, and unfunny comedy."
4,Phil Hartman is a Standout.... as is most of the cast.,"An above average comedy made three times as good by one of the best casts ever. Michael J Fox stars as the only nice member of a family waiting for a rich relative to die. Kurt Douglas, Nancy Travis and Ed Begley Jr are just some of the hilarious cast. My absolute favourite scene is the brawl between Michael and Phil, but the film is full of unforgetable scenes. See it for yourself."
4,Greedy Families... Interesting plot,"The ending of the movie, which I will not say anything about. I refuse to spoil it. Makes the whole movie awesome! Plus a pretty good cast."
5,Love this movie,"this movie was fabulous!it was relatable!the product was great, no stracthes or anything!Hilarious movie!Add it to your collection!"
4,It's a keeper,"I have the VHS of this movie and since I am getting all DVD's now, this one was a must. Great actors, super plot, this movie is a keeper."
5,Oh Chilhood Memories!,"I was 10 years old when this movie came out! Loved it as a kid and love it even more as an adult!Great cast, great acting, with an overall great message! It's great to have money, but not great when the money has you."
3,Long and rambling,"I found this DVD to be too long. The fashion shots were of interest but there was so much else going on it was hard to focus on fashion, as fashion, or the rambling story line. Ranked as a comedy, the American humour for me fell flat. However, it was an entertaining interlude and a very different take on the Paris Fashion Week. I much preferred the fast moving DVD The Devil Wears Prada."
3,Amusing and confusing,"When Robert Altman decides to parody, he doesn't do anything half way. Considering that the fashion industry is all about labels, the all-star cast is very appropriate, including: Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Lauren Bacall, Marcello Mastroianni, Sophia Loren, Linda Hunt, and Lyle Lovett.The story's parallel to the confusion prevalent in huge expositions, such as fashion shows, etc. We have murder, nudity, sex, and gossip--all the tender morsels the news feeds on. If you're a fashionista or someone who loves poking fun at the world of design, you're probably going to love this film.Rebecca Kyle, December 2009"
3,It was OKAY...,"I really love everything that has to do with fashion, but this movie was somewhat disappointing. I thought the bit with the ""editors"" of Vogue, Elle, and Bazaar was funny and as usual Sophia Loren was stunning. However, Julia Roberts was horrible. Watch it, if you don't have anything better to do."
1,The only movie I ever walked out on,"My patience with films and filmmakers is high, regardless of length or pacing. I watched the five-hour version of ""Fanny and Alexander"" in one afternoon with considerable pleasure. Conversely, I've sat through incredible stinkers to the last frame, hoping for some worthwhile glimmer that never came. With a director as demonstrably talented as Robert Altman, it seems impossible that he could create a film sufficiently awful to send me running from the theater in mid-movie.But he did.""Ready to Wear"" is unbearable. Painful. Unspeakable. There's nothing here except a colossal waste of talent. It's not bad in the right way to be unintentionally funny, and God knows the intentional ""comedy"" isn't funny. Stay far away from this cinematic torture."
3,"Garbage, with some exceptions...","This movie has an unbelievable cast and they are almost all wasted! However, I must give snaps to Altman for getting Anouk Aimee and Sophia Loren in front of a camera, and for a great performance from Kim Basinger, and for putting Linda Hunt in a movie, cause I love her. Roberts & Robbins scenes could have ended up on the editing room floor, and I doubt anyone would have missed them. The movie itself is a retread - see ""A Wedding"" instead. The dog poop thing gets boring after the 75th time you see it."
1,Perfect for a Buddhist Temple,"Ok the title of my review may seem odd, but if you ever see this movie you will understand. I tried as a test of wills to watch this movie from beginning to end on at least 3 occassions and I found my self at some point or another contemplating the universe and life in general. I would then snap back to the real world and realize i had missed some half hour or so of the film. So if you are in need of sleep or want to contemplate the sound of one hand clapping this movie is for you"
2,Too much of nothing,"What exactly is this supposed to be? I still can't figure it out. There is a dozen beginnings, that don't make much sense. There is a dozen endings that don't make much sense and there is a whole lot in between. With about a hundred characters that do, or do not have anything in common it gets to be just a little bit confusing. I had to watch this three times, before I could keep track of who was who. Think of the Ten Commandments but then with all the extra's playing parts compatible to Yul Brinner's and you get the idea. Altman tried, but this goes nowhere, with perhaps one in every ten plotlines holding any interest. 'Shortcuts' was a hundred times better."
1,Pure Dreck,"When this movie came out I was too young to see it, so I rented it last night and let me tell you, this movie is so bad it should be banned. I'm in a state of disbelief that an actor of Julia Roberts' caliber would agree to be a part of such a piece of crap! The only redeeming scene in this movie is when Tim Robbins says ""Je suis mort. Ou est je suis?"" in French, which doesn't make any sense so it's hilarious. Other than that, this is 2 hours of some of the biggest stars in the fashion world making fools of themselves, getting naked, and speaking an atrocious script."
1,Ready To Wear,"WORST 133 MINUTES I'VE SPENT LATELY. IT HAD SUBTITLES, THAT DIDN'T STAY UP LONG ENOUGH, AND JUST A STUPIT MOVIE OVERALL. COMPANY DELIVERED DVD IN RECORD TIME. THAT'S THE ONLY GOOD THING I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS PRODUCT."
1,Waste,Very flimsy and not worth the money. The storage is less than it appears and the bag below does not stay in place.
3,Missing Parts,"It was delivered with no mesh holding unit or prongs for attachment. Pretty difficult to use when some of the parts are missing. Never heard back from anyone without me sending constant emails. Very frustrating. After several weeks, they claim they are sending out missing parts. We'll see."
5,Perfect fit,It stores everything neatly in the garage. The kids are able to access their belongings easily and can store them away quickly.
5,"great product, just as advertized",I read the other reviews and ordered this item to find that it was all that it was advertized to be. The net material seems more than strong enough for the intended purpose. I love ordering through Amazon because I have always received my shipments early as I did in this case. I have loaded this item up with my son's balls and sports equipment and cleaned up the mess. The storage unit is more than sturdy enough to handle everything. The only thing that would make it better would be for it to be on casters to move it occasionally. Great product at a very reasonable price.
3,OK for the money,"We bought this because we have a ton of sports equipment and wanted to get it all organized at a reasonable price. It does hold all of our stuff, although a drawback is that since it is plastic and you assemble it yourself, once you set it up, you can't move it or it will come apart. There is no way to permanently assemble it. Baseball bats, helmets, etc are stored perfectly on the molded racks. The net at the bottom is very large and easily holds all our basketballs, footballs, etc. The other draw back we have is that our hockey sticks keeping falling out. The handles are narrower than the slots provided, so we prop them up in the back. ( We have about fourteen hockey sticks of various sizes). If you're looking to organize baseball bats and lacrosse sticks, this is awesome. If you have lots of hockey sticks, it'll be a problem."
2,Fair,"Has room for lots of balls and toys, and space to hang bats, skateboards, etc. The problem is if we hang too many bats it starts to sag as the shelves and supports are cheap plastic. It does the job but it's not high quality."
3,Very flimsy but...,"Mine came a little bent and not looking that good or sturdy. That being said, It's a great idea. I have it in full use for all the kids gear. It definitely helps keep the garage a little more organized. If it was made a little better it would be a 4 or 5 star product!"
4,"Entertaining, Uplifting Movie. Very Well-Made.","From the writer of Academy Award winning director Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" comes a modern retelling of ""Oliver Twist,"" mixed with ""Amadeus."" This is an excellent family movie (aside from some mild language, thematic elements and brief violence). Freddie Highmore (""Finding Neverland,"" ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"") does a very good American accent and can cry on cue. Keri Russell (""Waitress"") and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers are terrific. Robin Williams is menacing, but not quite a villain. Unfortunately, the movie ended too abruptly, hence the four out of five stars. Should've had a clear resolution. Other than that, I loved this movie. Rated PG for thematic elements, mild language and brief violence."
5,August Rush is a 5 star hanky,"I loved this movie. It has a good love story, fantastic music ( a crossover of Classical music & rock) and a 5 star hanky ending when LOVE AND MUSIC REUNITES."
3,"Nice story, if you suspend disbelief.","Cute story, predictable ending, but fundamentally not believable. Could have been a much better movie. Nice idea, but poor execution."
2,Artificial,I am so confused why this movie got so many high marks by so many reviewers here. The movie seems artificial and insincere.
1,Dissapointed.,I was not able to watch this DVD as I do not have the correct player to do so. I feel this should be advertised especially for overseas purchasers. I cannot rate this item correctly as I have not veiwed it. I have Have had my money returned.
2,Sickly sweet,"I was excited to see this film because I love fairy tales and those types of stories. This isn't really one. And compared to something truly wonderful like Pans Labrynth it's pedestrian and cliched.I can't actually believe how many good reviews it got, which just goes to show that one mans meet is another mans poison! I found it very sickly and just too cloying for my tastes.The cast were great however (waste of a great cast IMO) - well except for Robin Williams who over acted commendably. Jonathon Rhys Myers was good and the child actor was amazing. Just a pity they had such a weak story to work with.If you fancy checking it out though i would say to do so, it;s not an offensive film and obviously a lot of people really love it.Oh and it has Alex O'Loughlin in it for about all of three minutes but he steals the damn film with those minutes and he's very, very, very pretty here. So yeah two stars for Alex. It would have been one otherwise!"
1,Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen,"So, so bad. Sort of a ""Oliver Twist"" - boy deprived of his rightful destiny, in this case musical genius; and his misadventures while ""following the music"". The film had so many plot holes that made it absolutely impossible to buy into the story. I never believed from the get go that the two musicians fell in love, that they could never have found each other earlier, that a baby could be born and given to an orphanage without the mother's consent or even knowing what really happended, etc. etc.The dialouge was insipid and contrived; the dialouge during the scene where the two musicians have their once in life time one night stand;actually made me cringe it was so melodramatic and stupid.This movie is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen because of it's pretentiousness while it actually insults the intelligence of its audience."
5,August Rush - Freddie Highmore,August Rush by Freddie Highmore video is very intertaining and educational. It encourages children to perceiver to develop their God-given talent in this case in the field of music. August Rush will inspire children to pursue their musical ability overlooking any kind of diffculties and problems they are faced with. I recommend this to parents with children who are incline in music.
4,"Beautiful film, great cast and message","I finally had a chance to see this movie on blu-ray. As a music lover and believer in the power of music, for healing, catharsis, unity and many other powerful experiences and situations, I really enjoyed how the child attempted to speak to his ""lost parents"" and the parents to each other. The score of the film is itself very powerful and blended seemlessly in the story. The song lyrics sung by Jonathan Rhys Myers fit perfectly into the story, and the mom's face when she saw her son at the concert was priceless. This movie truly warms the heart, and is a great date movie, or an opportunity to remember the things that are important. Highly recommended!"
5,fOr tHe LovE oF musiC,This movie was magical!Without making this review too much of a downer...I am so glad that a song from this movie was nominated for an award! I hadn't heard about it and am fairly sure that this movie never came to my local movie theater.A fantastastic and completely uplifting piece of creative genius. The acting is spot on and a delight to watch. Captivating and moving.This movie had me from the beginning all the way to the final note!This was truly a delight to stumble upon and wish that the smaller movies such as this one would get more play than the latest slasher/teen drama/comedy stick!This movie was utterly breathtaking and a MUST SEE!!!e.
5,Great Movie!!,"Received in a timely manner. Wonderful movie to add to any collection. I also received notification of an instant movie, but didn't use it. So I can't comment on that."
4,"A Good, Sympathetic Magical Mystery Tour","August Rush conveys a goodness we want to see more of in the world. Music wraps the story in light and keeps the plot moving through the years. While not especially deep in its plot line, the goal of child finding his parents, parents finding their child and all finding each other has a philosophical depth that warms the heart."
4,Tugs at the Heartstrings,This is a sweet and uplifting little movie that lets you just sit back and enjoy. It won't change the world but it might change your mood. Enjoy.
4,"Very enjoyable, though far-fetched","I feel this movie really tears at one's emotions in a good, happy way. It's about an orphan boy who believes that one day he'll find his parents through the use of his music. It has a really great story, even though a lot of it is hard to believe. Like the fact that the boy never had any musical training, but can pick up a guitar for the first time and automatically just start playing it like a pro, or how he had never seen a note written down before in his life yet somehow is able to write an entire musical score in a half a days time.I do want to say that the music in it is amazing. Very catchy, yet emotionally powerful.All the same, this is a great family movie which is enjoyable and fun to watch as long as you dont pay too much attention to how impossible some of what happens really is. But hey, what else is fiction for other then to suspend reality a little bit?"
1,Harmful to gray matter....,"This movie is toxic to gray matter. My brain is in ICU - my family is praying for its recovery. Seriously, though this movie was a bad acid trip, replete with scattered characters, hazy plot, robotic acting, and a script you so banal it couldn't pass as a Microsoft Word template on which to build a real story. Oh, my head."
1,poor quality DVD,I bought a previously viewed August Rush DVD and tried it in two different players. Neither machine could read the disc. The DVD was a complete waste and should not have been available for purchase.
1,ABSOLUTE CRAAAAAAAAAAAAp,AVOID wasting time with this CRAAAAAAAAP filmthis is for women who like to feel better and cryGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYand i hate robin williamsAVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE
5,August Rush DVD,This is one of the best movies and stories I have ever seen. I loved all the characters. I wished they had a better ending cause it left me wanting more.
3,The Music is Everywhere... as is the premise,"I watched this movie with my family a few weeks ago, and as a music lover I found it to be entertaining in that respect. Overall I found it hard to suspend disbelief enough to really enjoy this movie. The story is WAY out there, so I took solace in the amazing soundtrack that Kaki King contributed to (the guitarist behind August's unique style).This movie was made ridiculous in my mind (after all the previous cheese) when visually the piano keys went up in 3rds, and the notes played went down in steps. It was only a second, but it was up close and as a pianist I definitely took notice and it was hard to overlook. ""C'MON, SERIOUSLY?!""Despite everything, it's a movie I haven't been able to get out of my head since, and I'd love for my kids to watch it someday. (Hopefully the fact that it's on HD DVD won't deter them!)"
3,Feel good,"It's a cute, feel good movie with a decent story line and the ending is nice. Just glad that I didn't pay full price for this movie. I could possibly watch it again."
5,Amazing music,Amazing music and a touching love story where hope brings together a family that has been separated and miserable for over a decade. Very under-rated movie and one that I recommend for viewers of all ages.
3,An A+ in Feel Good Quality,"This is the story of an attractive young couple, both of whom were musically gifted. They meet,make love, part, and unknown to the guy, a boy is born. He is born into a world without a mom or dad. He, too, is musically talented, and blows away adults with his advanced skills on the organ, guitar, etc. He seems to find friends and adults who help him develop and showcase his musical gifts. When he is called upon, at about the age of eleven, to direct a symphony orchestra in Central Park in New York, his parents, as though drawn by ocean tides, appear to celebrate some very, very special new beginnings! I have given a number of these to people who love music, in one case to a high school band director. For my wife and me, we watch it about every year. . . in August!"
1,Blu-Ray August Rush,I ordered this product (a great movie) and it was never delivered. The mechant claimed it was rejected at the delivery point which is not likely since I had it delivered to my work address (it was a surprise for my wife's birthday). Failed transaction lead to a no sale. Go figure...
1,Poor Service !,"Never was able to even watch the movie.THE BLU-RAY movie was defectivei emailed the seller and told him the problem and i was instructed to return it and mark it refused and my dvd warehouse also said, that they would replace the movie as we'll as pay theshipping cost also.i Nevergot any response regarding this purchase. Thanks to amazon.com i gota refund less the shipping cost to my dvd warehouse. I will never dealwith them again."
2,Disappointing ...,"Musically, this film was good and the 'music' and 'musicianship' content was great! A few faux pas on the playing scenes, but if you're not a seasoned musician, you'd never catch them.HOWEVER, the story was nothing more than warm, fuzzy, fluff. There were a lot of 'gaps' in the story and the realism was pretty lacking. I understand this wasn't intended to be a documentary or anything like that, and I wasn't looking for spoon-fed information, I was simply disappointed with the 'movie' as a whole. The acting side of things was pretty tragic. Robin Williams was good, in a disturbing way (due to the character), but the storyline and 'depth' in the other characters was pretty shallow.If you're looking for low-substance, warm, fuzzy, family film ... this one works well.If you are wanting something more 'real' or at least a sense of 'believable', then it's not."
2,August Bust,"This movie was soooo slow, and predictable I could have fallen asleep after the first 10 minutes, woken up during the last 5, and not missed a thing! It consists of a young boy, wandering around looking for his parents, meeting people who's characters are never developed, staring wide eyed at everything he comes across, then finding his parents. On the way we learn he is a musical prodigy, which provides the only redeeming quality of the film, the music.It is basically just a waste of time, but the music is good."
2,"Music showcase, love story or orphan's longing for his parents?","It is difficult to say what this movie is really about. We observe one night stand between rock star and classic musician and the product of that union is musical child prodigy. Due to set of circumstances kid speands 11 years of his life in orphanage. In his pathological desire to find his biological parents, kid runs away form the orphanage and changes his name from Evan Taylor to August Rush. Before you know it, this kid can play every instrument in the universe, he is accepted at Juliard and composes a symphony for the Cetral Park public performance. And of course, it all ends up happy. There is no focus to this movie since it wants to cover too much. Story may be good for a book but it is too unbelievable for the movie. Acting is forced and feels fake at the time. Body doubles with guitar playing, etc. are too obvious. This movie is not for everyone. Do not expect too much."
1,worst movie i've ever seen in my life...,it's just unbearably cheesy. not in the way that disney films are so that adults can enjoy them. this is just awful. filled with cliches and bad 90s style music and horrible acting.
2,Like an Oliver Twist remake,"O.k., here's my review, my short review. I don't recommend that you buy, nor rent this movie. It's too much like Oliver Twist, with a hint of Forest Gump. It's a love story none the less, but in every aspect, your typical Oliver Twist. What ever you do, don't watch this movie."
1,Almost the worste film I have ever seen,"The only person who could enjoy this film would be someone who could completely suspend all belief in reality. The story is so far fetched that it is laughable. It draws from various sources not least of which is Oliver Twist, with Robin Williams in the role of Fagin. I have read some of the reviews which praise the film and I am frankly amazed. I have seen worse films but am struggling to name them !!!!"
2,TAKE IT WITH A TON OF SALT,It's not like movies need to be 100% realistic and the fact is either you dig this type of fantasy or you don't. It's just hard to swallow August's Dad running +/- 23 blocks in half a song and ending up exactly 5 spots from his long lost love in crowd of thousands; August composing a whole concert in about 3 days; both his parents looking more like his older siblings; characters miraculous meeting around NYC as if it consisted of 2 square blocks and the insufferable Robin Williams yet again at his very worst.A must miss !
5,August Rush,"February 13, 2008I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It was just a great movie that comes along once in a while. I couldn't wait for this to come out on DVD so I went to the movies and saw the it the day before Thanksgiving Day in 2007. Very good movie. JB of Joliet, IL."
3,Sweet Chick Flick,"My girlfriend loves this movie, I am indifferent. The kid is kind of creepy in all honesty."
3,Not Musical or Video Rush I Expected,"Letdown describes my reaction to this movie. Told by others how much I would like this since they knew of my love for music and music lovers, set me up for this letdown.On the plus side, the photography was nice, and the theme of orphaned boy finally uniting with his parents is nice.On the down side, there was not enough of the classical side of music for me. Further, the Irish accent of the father was hard to understand. Overall the plot development seems too unrealistic, not that we all like fantasy now and then, but for some reason, this frustrated me in this film, and I haven't yet been able to articulate it. Maybe the characters therefore weren't that believable?Compare this with Sandy Bottom Orchestra and too me, there is no comparison. I can watch this once or twice a month and never tire. I will not give August Rush another viewing. The difference between a five star and three star."
5,What a Movie,"My sister recommended this movie, and I'm so glad she did. Anyone should like it. Even my husband did, and he is not too thrilled with love stories. But this had other aspects which made it enjoyable even to him."
5,Great Movie!,"My hubby and I love it! We have the DVD, and now we decided to get the BluRay. We recommend it to anyone..."
5,Great movie,I had seen August Rush on TV and had wanted to own it at some point. I waited and finally broke down and bought a blu-ray to see what all the talk was about. I received this item in excellent condition and on time. As soon as I could I watched a wonderful and enjoyable movie in vibrant and sharp color! Love the movie and would recommend this seller.
5,Awesome,"A great film. Really well done and I would recommended it to anyone. Clean, shows the beauty of music.""August Rush"" is a wonderful film that shouldn't be missed!"
5,An Incredible Story,I was amazed at the quality of acting by such young actors in this movie. A real bonus on top of this great story is the incredible soundtrack. I had seen the movie before but liked it so much I wanted to add it to my permanent collection of DVDs.
5,My heart was pounding and I gripped my armchair much of the time,"in hopeful anticipation of what was to come.I absolutely loved this movie and in fact paused it so I could call my daughter 2,000 miles away to tell her she MUST see this movie!The movie was magical. And many refer to it as a Fairy Tale and yet for me, personally, I viewed it as something very real, and THAT is what made it magical.For I have experienced, or known of, many things that many may find unbelievable, or coincidental, or magical and yet they were the Orchestration (pun intended) beyond our own thinking.And that magical wonder; that purposeful Orchestration is there all the time..all we have to do is listen."
5,lovee it,"cutest movie everrobin williams was a creeper but everyone else was amaaziing.. i really fell for it, like most reviewers say they did. Oh man though, the music was beautiful and freddie highmore was exceptional. I was alternatively smiling and half crying. i really enjoyed it, it was a little corny and weverything fell into place really easily buuuut i still enjoyeed it. though the ending was sort of quick.. :("
4,Unusual film,"I really enjoyed this film, though it is a little off of regular film fare. Maybe ""unusual"" is a better term. Actors all do a great job. Definitely recommended !"
3,A good family movie,"Safe movie to watch with anyone in the family.Movie is very predictable, though."
4,"""Field of Dreams"" for Musicians","Just like the baseball movie, this is about risk, confidence, and ultimately -- the concept of simply having faith. Being a musician helps -- knowing how music can flow through you; be part of who you are; change your perception of life. After this film I had tears streaming down my face -- as much for the movie experience as for those who will just never ""get"" this film. If you are a person who has no faith -- in anything, anyone or in a higher power, you will either hate this movie or be challenged to the max. Ask yourself -- is there anything you believe in enough to cast it all aside on faith? In this film, all three main characters did just that."
5,One of the best - EVER,"On a scale of one to ten, this movie is a 12! I have recommended it to friends who have bought it ""unseen"", and they've agreed with my opinion. One must ""watch"" this movie, and ""listen"" also. I sure wish they'd make more like this one!"
5,August Rush was a musical rush in itself,Beautiful display of talent and music. The warmth was radiant and the sadness permeable. I will watch and listen to the music for a long time. A wonderful movie for both young and old.
4,Almost 5 stars,"Great movie but why put a four letter word in this? Could of been a great movie for all ages, what were they thinking."
3,Great condition!,The product I received is in great condition. The time was not as quick as I would have expected but the quality is great!
5,This Movie was great,This movie was my all time favort movie and love it. I recommend that you buy this movie and see it. You will enjoy it as much as I did. It has a happy ending.
5,August Rush a very pleasant surprise!,"This is one of the better movies I have seen in a long while. I bought it from Pay Per View with my cable station and watched it alone , then watched it with my adult son then I went on line and purchased it from Amazon."
4,Can you hear the music?,"Great movie. I loved the love story aspect between man and woman, mother and son, boy and the world of music, all the musical ties to each character were wonderful. Freddie Highmore was amazing as Evan/August. The whole story was really good, and I couldn't wait for the big finish. I think the ending could have been done a little better as far as Lyla and Louis's roles being given more of a finish, but all in all it was satisfying."
3,Decent Movie,"Let me be up front right now. This movie is more about faith and music connecting everybody than anything. The story begins with Keri Russel and Jonathan Rhys Meyers playing Lyla and Louis, 2 individuals involved in music in different ways. Lyla is with the philharmonic and Louis is in a band. They meet one night, have a deep connection and then Lyla is forced away by her father. Lyla becomes pregnant and ends up in an accident. Her father tells her the baby died, but we then turn to the baby turned into an 11 year old at a boys home. The story then becomes about Evan (August Rush) and his journey throughout New York in order to play his music to find his parents. There are some really great moments in the movie, but you have to be able to put doubt about Lyla hearing Evan's symphony and knowing that is her son aside and just enjoy the movie."
3,okay,"Bought this as a gift. It's a interesting movie. Lots of cool music, good story line. A bit sad a times, but over all good."
5,"A thoroughly enjoyable""feel good"" movie!","Do you want a strictly believable story line? Go watch a documentary then!The acting and music are very good. The blending of diverse styles of music when the rock concert and the classical cello were playing together ties in with a universal language theme running through the movie. Intense in places but not too scary or melodramatic. Shades of Oliver Twist. Sad at times, but with a happy ending."
5,I beat off on this!,"As Yusuke begins his new job at the Best Beauty Body Lingerie Company, little does he know that he's about to find himself in the center of a ring of business and sexual intrigue. Charged to disrupt and eliminate the cohorts of an opposing faction."
3,"Not terrible, not wonderful","This is better than the usual low-budget ""everybody's back to spears and axes"" movie, but it's not a great film. If you are a big fan of Sean Bean it's pretty amusing to see him in such a setting. The story was decent and so was the acting. There were unrealistic things, but as long as you check your analytical brain at the door and just watch it to watch it, it's not bad."
1,Complete lack of craptasm!,"There are ""good"" bad movies and there are bad movies that just suck. Someone stole the Craptasticness from this one leaving it completely devoid of cheese.Resist all urges to push the ""Sean Bean"" button.One shining point? Kid playing ball with rock. That's it folks...kid playing ball with rock."
3,"Decent ""B"" movie","It was worth the 99 cents it cost to stream to me. Maybe it would be appreciated more by rabid Sean Bean fans? I don't collect ordinary ""B"" flicks, so I wouldn't buy it."
3,Good but predictable,"Mr. Bean in the post apocalyptic world, fighting beasts and greed and ignorance. Rent this cheap or free and you might not feel as bad about using up the time to watch it, poor character development."
1,Expected a lot better with Bean's name,"... and my expectations were low to begin with, given the premise, and that I'd never heard of it. After watching it, I can't believe it's averaging at 3 stars. From the opening credits, it had the feel of bad made-for-tv production and it got worse from there. Cliche'd writing, poor acting, a predictable story line, no surprising twists or character development... Worse than the rental cost was the time wasted watching. Skip this one."
3,better than i expected,"not a great movie, fun the cinematography is very good , and the sorry line is better than some post apocalyptic movies"
1,Worst movie I've seen this year.,"Everything coming out of Hollywood these days is either garbage or a remake. This is obviously in the former category.Like another reviewer said, ""utter nonsense""! No redeeming qualities."
1,Not good at all,"When it come to watching movies, I always read a couple of reviews prior to making the decision to watch or not. In this case, I should've heeded the warning that this was a really bad movie. This is just plain crapola, don't waste your time or money on this donkey."
2,One word TERRIBLE............,"they never really got to the point, sean bean pulled of his part though. I was hoping for something a better though."
1,Truly Bad Film,"Watched this on the SyFy Channel while sick at home in bed. Typical of that cable channel's offerings, this was another hum-drum affair, with poor production values and an even worse narrative, which was a derivative hodgepodge of ideas cobbled together from previous films. Only illness and nothing else on kept me watching; an embarrassment for Bean. I've seen worse films, but not many. The 3-star, let alone 5, rating are absurd. Avoid unless you're stoned, drunk, or generally brain-addled."
1,Can you give a negitive 'star'?,This flick is so bad it now has a place in my list of ten worst movies. Stone age post holocaust humans fighting fugly infectoius trogs. Barley one dimentional characters romping through a national park forest sputtering dialogue in pursuit of a vague plot that would embarase a highschool freshman. Don't waist your money.
4,"Fun Sci-fi movie, but felt unfinished or part of a series",This was a great dystopian future sci-fi movie that feels like a strong pilot for aTV series. End of the movie made me wonder what happens next but midway towards the end I realized that they were probably not going to wrap everything up.
2,the movie Sean wants to forget,"Sean had to start somewhere.Its a good movie for young kids.Weak plot ,been done before in other movies,and the acting well you judge."
1,CORNY movie,We suffered through the movie but it was very corny and predictive. Glad I only paid $.99 I would not pay for more. Also there was one sex scene that I could not even figure out why it was even in there. The story is about how our society failed and then went back to the caveman age. If you like zombies then you might like this. We do not like zombies and did not like the movie. two thumbs down!
3,Okay,It was okay. The acting was all that. Typical straight to DVD type movie. Like the story line but just wasn't into the story as much.
4,A movie to watch when you want to see Sean Bean,movie is ok. Had lots of exciting moments and was worht weatching when you have nothing else planned. Not really great but worth the watch
2,I've had more fun dreaming in bed!,Revolution the TV series is 10 times better. Sean Bean is the type of actor who needs a good supporting cast around him or he fades into the background. The main characters suck worse!
2,way too boring,"seriously this movie put me to sleep....confusing, odd...all over the place...too bad the preview had me...thought it was going to be fast paced....just wasn't"
4,Different twist on end of world scene,It is the same old story world as we know it ends this time a plague turns people into cannibals.. Of course the one with the cure holds the power.The starting twist is this tribe at start is led to believe they are all thats left beside the rest that are diseased.. I wish this system would allow half stars 3.5 is more to my view..
1,Utter nonsense (and poorly acted),"Utter nonsense, poorly acted, dire, wretched, poor, dreadful, appaling awful and a total and complete waste of your time. I think Sean Bean must have short for cash that week......"
3,Plain Nasty,Wow this guy didn't know many boundries did he?. Torture and [...] ...oh my this is a nasty book.
4,Loved it!,"This was one of his best. I loved the characters and I couldn't wait to find out what would happen to the woman in the bath! Some of Laymon's characters are so perverted, you just can't believe the things he comes up with. I find his books are fast paced and well-written. He isn't overly descriptive as Dean Koontz (another favourite) has become. He sticks to the point of his story throughout. I would definitely recommend this book to any Richard Laymon or horror reader fan."
5,Quake with fear,"Another fine offering from Richard Laymon. This time we see a family struggle after a devastating earthquake disrupts the entire city.As with any disaster, looters and worse rear their ugly heads. But central to the fear is lonely Stanley, a former peeper who now has an opening to actually pursue his desires. After all, in the madness following the quake, who will notice some premeditated violence. His goal is the family's daughter and his drive is relentless. He knows that once the city has recovered, he will have lost his chance to pursue his perverse fantasies.Laymon once again shows us the dark heart of people when civilizations restraints have been removed. A fine read."
4,One Good Tune to Another,"Chorley called ROSA BIANCA a ""poor opera"" when it was first performed in London in the 1820s. It is certainly not an exciting one in the way that this composer's MEDEA IN CORINTO is. Mayr's and librettist Romani's view of a heraldic and pastoral Wars of the Roses England is simply too bland. Vanoldo, the opera's wishy washy villain just can't scare us the way Medea does. What this work does have is tune after beautiful tune, superb orchestration and first rate choral writing.The performance is ably conducted by Thomas Briccetti and features particularly fine work from Anna Caterina Antonacci and Luca Canonici. Susanna Anselmi in the travesti role of Enrico, once a favorite role of Giuditta Pasta, hasn't got a particularly attractive voice, but is fully up to the role's considerable technical demands.A fine sound recording."
2,"Odd, sloppy and poorly produced","I saw this book in the bookstore, and it looks like it was a rush job. The images are all really dark, the paper's poor quality, and there were numerous typos. Why is there sushi on the cover? There's none on the inside. I'm not sure who this book is intended for, but it didn't seem to be much more helpful than the user guide."
2,I'll stick with the camelbak,"The bottles were difficult to get in and out during the run and there were defects along the rim, which allowed the bottles to leak. I was very disappointed to say the least. Needless to say... I have a Fuelbelt for sale."
4,Great for long distance running!,"I was overall impressed by the quality of the Fuelbelt 6 Bottle Belt I ordered from Amazon. The belt was true to size and feels very secure when worn. The only problem I encountered with the belt is that the bottles have a tendency to leak if laying on their sides while freezing. When running, the belt minimally interferes with my running stride and it remains securely in place around my waist. I would highly recommend this product."
5,Outstanding!,"Bob Amos is a tremendous talent. He is a very versitile songwriter, and a fantastic singer. I would highly recommend this recording to anyone who enjoys good music. Get it!"
2,yes they do crack,"well, i read the reviews and bought a set thinking that they would nt crack...its been less than 2 weeks and one down....."
4,Nice Cups for Kids,"These set of cups are good size for kids 4 to 10. They are made of heavy duty plastics. Nice color and easy to clean. However, there is no information available whether these cups contains BPA or not."
5,"Fine, classic family entertainment","This is the type of movie you walk away from thinking, ""They sure don't make family films like this anymore"". And you know what? They don't!Released in 1948, ""Hills of Home"" takes the world's favorite collie and places her in the hills of Scotland in a small farming town. Lassie has a phobia of water, and is turned away by a shepherd, only to be taken in by a country doctor, played by Edmund Gwenn, who is bound and determined to help his new friend overcome her fear.The script is the right combination of wit, drama, and action. The cast is top notch, including Tom Drake as an apprentice of Gwenn's, whose father refuses his studies to be a doctor, and a young Janet Leigh (in of her first film roles) as the girl of Drake's affection.The scenic work is beautiful, the costumes are lush, and since it's an MGM film, you know that nothing was spared in creating a true classic film treasure."
3,Cheap price,"I haven't watch it yet, the reason for three stars I got it at the thrift store for 50cents. And so far the reviews has been good. So hopefully I will like it."
5,Good Leaders Don't Need Good Luck,"""...behavior (is) only a cost until its value is clearly defined and its return on investment can be determined."" -Leslie Braksick, PhD.Dr. Braksick has done it again! She's turned magic into method by harnessing the science of applied behavior analysis and making it work for ANY leader as a REPLICABLE template for achieving and sustaining optimum organizational performance. We're wearing this book out referencing it against our strategic and day-to-day management applications."
4,Excellent introduction to behavioral study,"This text provides a very clear introduction to ABC analysis as well as the use of PIC/NIC in the study of organizational behavior. In addition, it offers several examples that never leave you wondering how these techniques should be applied. The inclusion of feedback and coaching advice for leaders is terrific. If you are a manager or student of human behavior this text is a great introduction."
2,Read your manual instead.,I'm very impressed with my other Kreg products but I feel I didn't learn anything from this DVD I didn't already know from reading the directions provided with my pocket jig.
3,Kreg dvd,I was somewhat disappointed. You can view most of the information presented at other places on the internet. Kreg should provide this free as advertisement rather than charging for it.
3,So-So,"While I suppose this is useful if you have never seen the system used, Kreg is better at making tools than they are at making videos. It isn't bad, but it isn't excellent either."
3,Love my Kreg the DVD is OK for new users,"This is a better DVD for people just starting out using tools and the Kreg. People that have used tools for years will find the DVD a review of common knowledge. I still picked up some tips so not all is lost, and I will pass it on to my kids to learn so they can use the Kreg."
1,Too light on detail,I found the video skipped many salient points like setting up jig for wood thickness. No planning was included for cabinetmaking. I would not recommend it.
4,Cool Tool,This tool going to be useful but the DVD does not have as many projects as I thought it would have.
1,Don't waste your time if you want to learn about the Kreg sys,"If you want to learn techniques on the Kreg system DON'T buy this DVD. It's a video of a guy building a cabinet, not anything on the finer points of using the tool. I should have read the other reviews first. Kreg should pull this product."
2,"If you've seen a Kreg demo, don't waste your time","Let me say at the outset that I love the Kreg jigs. I own one of the master sets and use it all time. In fact, it's one of the most-used tools in my shop. It's a testament to Kreg's jigs that the company has become virtually synonymous with pocket hole tools, although a variety of companies produce them.That said, this DVD is nothing more than a brief demo. It may be worthwhile if you've never seen a pocket hole jig used, but you'll get just as much out of a 10 minute in-person demo at your local Woodcraft or woodworking show.By the way, referencing comments in a few other reviews - my copy of this DVD WAS free when I purchased my jig."
2,Biology:Exploring Life:,"It was not what I expected. I had put in the ISBN# and I thought everthing on the page was the correct ISBN#. It just said Learninglog.It did not say learning log for on line activities. I felt cheated and disappointed, because it was not what we needed at all. I fell like it was a waste. I bought two, one for my son and one for his friend. Luckly, the teacher has been understanding and given us the pages he needs. Thank you. Brenda"
1,did not enjoy this book at all.....,"this book takes you back into medievel time. The story is weak and talks about a submissive man and his mistress, it's not at all interesting. I wanted to throw it away after reading it halfways. I made myself finish reading because I paid for it, I shouldn't have wasted my money....."
4,Fine 35mm lens for Leica Screw and M Mount rangefinders,"The Voigtlander Ultron 35mm f1.7 aspherical wide angle lens offers at a reasonable price similar optical performance which Leica users have had to pay over a thousand dollars for. I have seen test reports where this lens is rated to perform as well as the last non-aspherical lens element Leica 35mm f2 Summicron lens. In practical terms unless you have to photograph constantly wide open, you won't notice any difference between this lens and the current, expensive 35mm f2 ASPH Summmicron-M lens. Leica M mount rangefinder users will have to purchase a screw to M mount adaptor to mount this lens onto their cameras."
4,Beautiful Machine EXCEPT for constant failure of power connector,"I have had several of these machines --- with them typically moving once a day. All of them have the middle pin of the power connector breakoff within a year. The only authorized repair is to replace the ENTIRE mother board (some $700 is out of warranty).If you buy one, make sure you get an extended warranty for any of this line of PCs -- and be prepare to have it in repair for 2 weeks a year (and be prepared for it)."
4,5 years & still going,"This baby is a heavy carry & I've burned out more ac adapters & batteries than I'd like to mention - but this baby is over 5 years old and still going. As long as you have anti-virus installed, you shouldn't have any problems."
3,"Nice fridge, very noisy","I purchased this refridgerator for my office at work -- figured it would be very convenient to put my luch in. I had read reviews that you need to unplug the fridge for an hour every 48 hours, but when I talked to the seller, they said the power cable was upgraded and this isn't a problem any more. It gas been running for about a week and no problems yet. The only downside to this unit is that it is very noisy. So depending on where you plan on using it, it may be very distracting. When I had it plugged in on the first floor, I could hear it running when I was on the second floor. It is a decent unit for the price, just know what to expect."
3,The Hunt for Hidden Killers,"Very disappointing if you have already read The Medical Dectective by Berton Roueche; or vice versa they are 90% the same, but a very interesting read if thats what your into!"
2,Didn't do what I wanted,"I bought it to get rid of tall, thin, wheat-like weeds, but the instructions say it works for weeds with foliage. I sprayed it on them anyway just in case, and now I have a bunch of brown circles in my yard (most of my yard is crabgrass) with the weeds I wanted killed still standing tall. I sprayed it on some other weeds with lots of foliage, and all it did was wilt them a little."
1,No tie out included!,"The picture and description did not state that the product did not include a tie out! (But the package I received clearly had it written on front of package) KV wouldn't pay for the tie out (only the shipping) and will not reimburse my cost to ship it back! Plus, the operator wanted to debate if the product should include a tie out. (""Sir, it is sold as a trolley"" - I guess I learned my lesson. The last trolley I bought included a tie-out, but dumb ol' me shoulda realized......!)Suggestion - 1.) Clearly state what is included in package (including updated picture). 2.) Send the tie out for no cost (what is 9.95 vs. good customer relations). 3.) At least pay for return shipping! (Cheap skates!)I will never buy from this company again."
1,Poor GPS initiation and reception,"I have owned this product for 2yrs now and I must say it has not been an easy ride. I just bought a Garmin to replace it. Sometimes you get to your destination before the unit gets a gps fix. The GPS receiver built into this unit is the weakest on earth. It takes about 30min - 1hr for the unit to locate your position after every power on. This is very bad especially when you are in a hurry. If you don't mind waiting for 30mins for a fix, then this product is good for you but if not, I will advise you to look around some more..."
4,Unique story that will make you think.,"Voices in the Park is not your typical book. There is no plot, as such. The afternoon's events are told by 4 different characters and clearly you will see that each one has a very different outlook. This is a good book to open to discussion with children that things are not always as they seem, that one person's fun is another person's bother, and to be mindful of our differences is what can hopefully connect us.Not what i call a 'feel-good' book. Its not fluffy. This is a story that will bring about thought and discussion."
3,eh.,"Voices In The Park arrived at my house a little bit bent. As in, it was not in good shape at all. Aside from that, the book was crazy. I didn't like how the mother was discriminatory towards others, but maybe that's to teach the children that discrimination happens and is not good."
5,Voices in the Park,"I loved this book. I used it to help my students understand voice in writing. After reading the book, they did some writing of their own in different voices for the same ""story"". They had a great time learning and they loved the story Voices in the Park."
5,My students enjoyed this book very much.,"Our class has discussed the book for a week, pointing out all the interesting things that are on each page. We just wanted to know a little something about the author and why he uses gorillias in his books."
2,very slippery to hold,"The pen writes well enough, and collapses nicely (although I don't really have a use for this particular gimmick). However, the metal shaft is very hard to grip. As I write, my fingers rapidly slide down the shaft and I lose my grip. So it's actually quite unpleasant to write with, in my opinion."
2,Not the Pen as Advertised,"I received a different pen than advertised. I received a retractable Zebra pen but it is not the pen they advertise. It's impossible to tell whether it was an innocent error or they knowingly shipped me the wrong pen hoping that I wouldn't go through the hassle of returning such an inexpensive item. If the latter is true, then they were right. I did not return it. CAVEAT EMPTOR."
1,Pitiful,"I gave this CD one star, only because there is nothing LESS. How can ANYBODY call this stuff ""MUSIC?"" When I think of all the immmortal, incredible rock and roll we used to have in the past, this kinda stuff is an absolute disgrace. When I hear crap like this, I actually feel EMBARRASSED for the person performing it. ""Plant man knows where the plants will grow."" Yeah, right. That song had to take every bit of a minute and a half to write. When I was a kid, if someone had tried to record an album like this one, they would have been laughed out of the room."
5,Wonderful piece of fiction,"I bought this book after reading a positive review in Hadassah magazine, and the praise was well warranted. I enjoyed the story line, and particularly the hopes, dreams, and struggles of the characters. Ms. Pollack tackled the subject of race relations in a satisfying way. The Catskills were a place I vaguely remember visiting as a child when my grandparents would make their annual summer trek. To learn something of the history and demise of the ""borsht belt"" made for fascinating reading. Most interestly, I mentioned the book to a non-Jewish, 65-year old neighbor when I was through, not necessarily thinking she'd want to read it. It turned out that she and a close friend worked at one of those hotels in the 1950's when they were in college. Not only did she love the book, she told me the portrayal of the dynamics of hotel life was right on target and even helped her understand some of what she experienced that summer."
1,"You get what you pay for, I guess",The battery door broke the first time we took the camera out of the box. Seems cheaply constructed. We sent it back for a refund.
2,"Easy to use, but poor quality","Camera is easy to use. Point and click.However many issues:1. They advertise 16MB... however, I could only take 6 high resolution pictures. Effectively, this only holds a total of 2MB. So, they are advertising this wrongly.2. Quality is good on outside pictures.. inside pictures quality is really poor. Especially on medium and low res.3. Battery life... batteries died after taking three sets of pictures. Also, my current pictures went away when battery died.Overall, simple to use camera; however, poor quality of pictures. I am planning to return this..."
2,"Good for the money, but","I've had this little camera for about 3 weeks now. I like the price and the size, but has enough drawbacks that I'm going to return it. First, the FAQ says that it will hold 15 high quality pictures. I couldn't get more than 5 on my camera. No problem, you say, add a CF card. The FAQ states that the camera will take 128mb CF cards, but not in my camera. When I finally got a response from their tech support, they could not provide a solution other than to buy the iClick brand 32mb CF.... I responded asked for more information, like, ""Which CF 128mb card WILL work in your camera?"", and haven't received a reply. Photo quality? I liked the outdoor photos and most of the indoor photos looked good. Some looked a little mottled, but I could have lived with that if the camera would hold more than 5 photos! I guess I'll look for something else."
5,Easy to use,"This camera is perfect for me because they've eliminated all the hassle. A few buttons and a few functions, and that's it! It's a relief to see something being simplified as opposed to complicated, and I would recommend the I-click to people who are interested in having good, digital pictures that are truly ""point and shoot"". Thanks a lot guys!"
5,review for Faith cd,"I had the pleasure of seeing this gifted vessel minister ""Stop Searching"" in Houston this summer. This song is so real and so anointed,I was truly blessed! It is apparent,that through the message in his song that he has an intimate relationship with the Father. If you are in need of a blessing,do yourself a favor and purchase this cd. I pray that doors of opportunity will swing wide open for Anthony Faulkner."
2,Not what was in the picture.,"The photo shows an M5 cage nut, but what I received was 10-32. You can use it with M5 screws if you're not picky about the sloppy fit, but I'm not going to order any more, because I don't know what they're really going to ship."
4,Perfectly good product,"I ordered these because they had the best price. They work perfectly fine and they are M5 like the discription says. I rated it 4 star because 4 star is supposed to mean ""I like it."" I would rate it 5 star (I love it) except it's hard to love something as mundane as a cage nut.I read the 2 star review by ""Financial Consultant 'MH'"". He claims he got 10-32 nuts instead of M5. He also says ""You can use it with M5 screws if you're not picky about the sloppy fit."" 10-32 screws have a diameter of .190 inches. M5 screws are .197 diameter. Therefore, the 10-32 screw would have the sloppier fit than an M5 so I think MH is mistaken. The nuts I got had ""M5"" stamped on the side of each one."
1,This is not the version in the reviews,"Based on the two editorial reviews above, I bought several copies of this book. I love Gogol's original text, but wanted something for my kids. I've paraphrased it to them so much that my six year old dressed as a nose for Halloween this year. Sadly this is nothing like the kids version in the editorial reviews. Instead it is a lame english learner version, without charm or illustrations. I'm disappointed."
5,The Nose,"The Nose by Nikolai Gogol. Translated by Claud Field. Published by MobileReference (mobi).A man named Kovalyov wakes up that morning to discover his nose is missing, in its place nothing but smooth skin. ""The Nose"" spends many pages following Kovalyov through futile attempts to recover his nose. Like the narrator, Kovalyov is often distracted from his mission by random thoughts and events. Gogol purposely mangles form and content, breaking all conventions of traditional writing."
2,Not too hot,"""The Gurnius Affair"" guest-starred future ""Laugh-In""Sock It to Me gal Judy Carne, but it lacks the lustre whichboosted the popularity of this fad series. ""The Master's VoiceAffair"" is a typical third-year turkey which forecasted the wayfor this show's eventual demise."
4,everything I hoped for,"I am a suedo pesco-vegan. Which mean when I have the choice I eat to those standards. But when I do not have the choice I do not complain to the chef. I have been a vegetarian in the past, and I hate tofu. As you know, a redicules amount of modern vegitarian food uses tofu. So what I was hoping in getting this cookbook, is that there would be no tofu reciepts; and I was right. my only problem is that after going vegitarian, eggs stopped agreeing with me, and I don't really mind, because I never thought much of eggs anyways, but there are alot of eggs used in these reciepts. With a little research I have found alternatives to eggs(not substitute eggs either) and this book can feed me the rest of my life."
4,Grandma's purchase,"Great portable crib. Goes together easily, and folds up easily. Made well, and nice looking at the same time. Love the fact that you can roll it. Can't wait for our grandchildren to be sleeping peacefully in it."
2,They Came Seeking: History of Christian Pioneers,"This book tells the history of early pioneers in Christianity pursuing their missions in the early 1900's. The author presents anecdotes of early Baptist ministers spreading the word across the mid-west.Particularly poignant are the old photographs that are included with each of the stories. Two separate stories are told of Christian teachings on two different Indian Reservations (Cherokee and Najavo).Also included is a short biography of William N. Hubbell, who was pastor at Mariner's Temple, New York for 25 years.The book is written in journalistic style befitting the 1930's. It is straight-forward and easy to read."
3,Robin Hood for women,"This was a more pleasant, feminine telling of the traditional Robin Hood story. I have never gotten into the whole Robin Hood thing but found I enjoyed the telling from Maid Marian's point of view. Marian at first is a naive spoiled princess who cannot bear to sleep on straw. Being an orphan, however, puts her in the hands of the dreaded and feared Queen Elinor, and to avoid the Queen's plans, she enlists the aide of the famed outlaw, Robin Hood. This leads to a new life of adventure and discoveries and love. The spoiled princess blossoms into a strong woman that is not only a lady, but can work a field and sleep on straw with the rest of the hard working world. A good story with a pleasant ending even though I did not get excited about it. May be appropriate for young adults also."
3,A fun romp thru Sherwood Forest!,"I enjoyed this perspective from Maid Marian. She sounded very much like the teenager she was. The legend of Robin Hood gives the reader a familiar backdrop, and the story can take right off. I liked how she became more introspective as it progressed. Then, it took a turn for the dramatic and felt like reading an escapade like those I'd watch in black & white on a Saturday morning as Errol Flynn battled Basil Rathbone!"
4,Beach Read,"I first learned about this book in some ""Beach Reads"" book list - fun and entertaining books to read at the beach, on summer vacation, etc. And the book is just that - a fun and entertaining beach read. It is not meant to change the world, or even really add to it in any way. So don't write some scathing review when the novel was not intended to solicit any type of deep, thought-provoking emotion.I highly enjoyed it - the novel is fun and cute. You move fairly quickly through the book and it's fun to be in the Sherwood Forest and imagine Robin Hood falling in love with the young Maid Marian."
2,"Good young teen book, bad quality","I loved this book when I was a mid-teen. So I was looking for it and I found it here on amazon. So I bought it.When I got it, the book is paperback, like it said, but the cover wasnt even attached to the book and the binding part of the cover looked like it was sliced with a box cutter. So I returned it and asked for a replacement, I got it in the mail within 2 days of placing the order, but the cover was barely attached, yet again. Cover was so annoying while reading since it was barely hanging on that I pulled it off.So good book, bad book quality..."
2,Easy Read - 2.5 Stars,"Maid Marian is an easy read. I have to agree with some earlier reviews that the author spends too much time telling and not enough showing. I liked the premise of Marian trying to control her own destiny and enlisting Robin Hood's aid in doing so, but somehow their actions fell flat. It seemed like all of the action oriented things happened off camera. Marian spends her time telling us about them, not really involved with them until the end.Overall, I'd give the book 2.5 stars.Anyone interested in an engrossing Maid Marian story might like to try Lady of the Forest by Jennifer Roberson. I read it in one night. The sequel Lady of Sherwood was not quite as involving, but still a good read."
2,K. Hoy,"I really wanted to love this novel - the premise has so much potential. Unfortunately, it was little more than fluff. The story in the hands of Elsa Watson is told rather than shown, giving the reader no opportunity to be immersed in the drama. While Ms. Watson is a capable enough writer, she does not know how to pull a reader in. In the hands of a more experienced novelist, Phillipa Gregory, for example, Maid Marian would have been incredible. I wanted a great summer novel. What I got instead was a ho-hum treatment that missed countless opportunities to be terrific."
2,Interesting....,This is an interesting collection but not Diana Ross's best. On some of the songs her voice does not seem as strong as it used to be. I think this was a good concert but not good enough to be released and sold. She seems to rush through several of the songs and can't reach the high notes.
5,Terrific Camera Worth Every Penny!,I purchased mine at best buy and paid over 200.00 more for mine.I absolutely love this camera it's easy to use and the pictures and video are just beautiful! Best part there is no delay in the shutter it will stop action not blur or miss it. It is so much easier having an all in one -it's so small. I am really impressed. I have had just a point and shoot 2mp for years it was time to update I was little nervous over the price but it is cheaper than buying 2 seperate cameras which was what i was looking at.I can say it was worth the money when i can finally get some wicked good portrait quality pictures.i can't wait to take it on vacation.If your looking for a 2 in one this is the ticket.
4,DVD Camcorder,"I love my camcorder, I havenot found this model in the store. Everyone that has meet me on my vacation loves my camcorder. I is little light weight easy to travel with. It takes nice pictures."
4,"Nice camera, terrible shipping service","The camera is very nice, the still images quality is very high.The software is not so good, it can not get a normal DVD for support the videos.I paid a two days service because I needed my camera, but after two days I did not receive the package, I contacted UPS office and I had to go to UPS offices three times, and in third I got my package, Terrible service."
5,Sony DCR-DVD505 Handycam,Very good product. Excellent picture. I use JVC DVD-RW and performance is outstanding. I down load to my computer and use Nerovision express 3 to convert to DVD.
5,Fantastic features/Very happy.,"This camera burns dirctly to DVD. Can finalize and unfinalize disks to allow adding pictures or video. Touch screen features allow editing with camera, itself. Very useful for quick editing, including dividing scenes for deletion of parts of scene. Very happy I bought this camera!"
1,Sony DCR DVD505,Please think before you spend your money on this unit. I have one that is just over a year old and is now dead because of touch screen that no longer works. I cannot believe that Sony built such a weak system for this unit. I will put the 211.00 towards a new Canon.
3,Weak Touch Screen When Finalizing,Bought This Sony 505 Years ago. Suddenly the screen was unresponsive and I Could not Finalize my Recording.I was goung to get it repaired but too Much Money.I found out that you do not need to finalize by the touch screen. Just bring up the menu through your remote that comes with it. It will allow you to finalize all your recordings. The Key is the remote control that comes with the camera.M. FreemanPalm Coast FL
2,LCD touch screen not working,i had this sony 505 camcorder it was working ok one day and the LCD touch screen is not working well and now i cant finalize muy specal moments iam not well satisfid with this sony the picture is not that good its ok for rough moments i called it the price is to much for this thing save your money thanks for this review i hope it helps some one
4,I think its delicious,"So I got this food for my turtle which is little more than a hatchling. So far this has been the only ""healthy"" food the turtle has shown any interest in but I think Im going to need to get some genuine hatchling food. I was impressed with fast delivery. Also the food tends to stay together better and instead of completely dissolving in a weird mess making it easier to clean."
4,Ignore the other review,"This group is a capella. The ""canned music background"" is created by one of the members of the group (he is just that good). The only reason this does not warrant 5 stars is that if you have the two earlier albums you already have 1/2 of the songs on this one. If you do not own the previous two albums by all means get this."
4,Magnus Watch winder,I had been looking at watch winders for a while - you can spend anywhere from $25- $1000 so I was particularly interested in the reviews. The reviews for this one seemed consistent and the ones for the more expensive ones did not seem to be any better so I bought 2 of these (one for a co-worker) I like mine just fine - it is a little noisy since I have it right next to my bed so I have it on a timer that only allows it to run from 5AM to 10PM - it's working fine and I now wear my kinetic a little more often than I was because I don't need to reset it
2,you get what you pay for,"It's ok overall for the money, but if you think you're going to get something like a $100 mahogany product for $25, think again. Cheap plastic box with a basic motor in it all made in China. when new, it's really silent but after couple of weeks or so, it becomes noisier and noisier and now it's like a cofee grinder. plus, I think if you leave the watch on it for 4-5 days or more, it will eventually stop winding itself, the machine just spins too slowly and monotoneusly to move the rotor inside the watch. When it finally breaks down, will most likely NOT buy another one."
2,Not for all watches,I have a Seiko kinetic watch that this unit does work on. The unit works as adverstised however the circular motion the watch moves in does not work on keeping my watch wound.
2,OK for the Money,"It's not a high quality winder. Mine was not quiet from the begining and sometimes I need to take the power cord out and in to get it to start.By the reviews I read before buying it, I knew what to expect, so I am OK with it. Now, I wish I had get one with both ac and dc power to put the watch in the safe."
3,magnus winder,"good product. it has two modes (clockwise and counter-clockwise)and it rotates one hour on three hours off. It is noisier than i expected. It's not loud if you're working in the room, but at night when its silent it can be a little irritating. I am a deep sleeper so it doesn't bother me much. overall a good product."
5,Large Bench Clamp System,Addition to my Kreg kit. great tool for pocket screw holes. used in cabinet making and trim work.
2,annoying and a one trick pony,it really has only trick then it gets really anoying - the sound will drive you batty. In our recent move it suddenly dissappeared....oops sorry kids.
2,Over rated boring,"These tapes were a waste of my money. They are boring to listen to, for both adults and kids. Most of the time you can't really understand what the person is saying on them, so it makes it a useless background noise. My boy did learn a lot of spanish from the little people tape I bought for him that has kids singing songs in spanish. I did too for that matter."
4,Kreg pocket hole joinery-tables,This video is very good for anyone interested in making tables with pocket joiner. Video very easy to follow and I recommend it.
2,not worth the money,"the dvd shows you how to build ONE table ,the one on the cover.and thats it.the cover should say TABLE! not TABLE'S. it's not worth the money"
4,Back Support,"It helps a lot to maintain a good posture, but after a wile, the zipper becomes uncomfortable on the back skin."
4,The tell all relationship of FDR and WSC,"This book chronicled the friendship of FDR and WSC. It explained how England needed the help of the US to fight Hitler and how they went about it. There were many highs and lows re these two leaders in their lifelong friendship and mutual respect for each other.Meacham takes the reader on a step by step look into the history of WWII and the leaders of the countries involved.Included are biographies of FDR, WSC, and Josef Stalin and the competition for who would have the ultimate say re Germany and the countries in eastern Europe's post World War II future."
5,History told from personal notes of Franklin & Winston,Very well researched and written. Tells the story of friendship and political obstacles these two men faced against their own peoples while attempting to stop the Nazi machine.
3,It was just OK,"To me it was more of a scattered thoughts and statements, than an organized presentation of information - that I expected."
5,Outstanding,"An enormously enjoyable read about two of the greatest leaders of the 20th century, Franklin and Winston provides a rare glimpse into this complicated relationship, from Winston's almost childlike admiration of FDR to FDR's clever but hurtful deception of Winston at Tehran and again at Yalta. Beautifully written and with great insight. I was also glad that the photos shown in the Kindle were large and clear enough to view well."
4,Living History,"Bought the book for my 99-year-old grandfather who needs large print and loves history, especially history that he lived! He thoroughly enjoyed the book and said it affirmed many things about Roosevelt and Churchill that he felt were true during the war years."
3,Not much new,"For World War II history buffs, Meacham isn't mining a lot of new information here as to the relationship between Roosevelt and Churchill---just expanding on it. The most interesting parts, to me, were the the revelations on the childhoods of both men (which had so much to do with their relationship), the role of Harry Hopkins as a go-between (I can't imagine anyone enjoying that sort of influence today) and the last meeting of Roosevelt and Lucy Mercer Rutherford just before the President's death and the subsequent personal correspondence between Lucy and Eleanor. Interesting read."
4,comparing 2 powerful men,Good insights into what makes these two tick. Especially interesting how they use each other to compliment their own weaknesses and build a stronger whole. Shows the importance of relationships in everything.
4,Not Much New Here,"To anyone who's done any reading at all about these two men, most of this book is repetitive. This is another venture into the friendship of the two world leaders during a perilous time for our world and I must say I found it a little superficial. Maybe my problem is that I have long been familiar with the friendship between these two. Doris Kearns Goodwin's ""No Ordinary Time"" does, I feel, a superior job of analyzing the relationship between Churchill and Roosevelt. Meacham's book is creditable and nothing is lost by reading it. Also, whether intended or not, he seems to paint Roosevelt as more of an opportunist than Churchill. I find myself wondering if Roosevelt really liked Winston or if he just feigned friendship as a marriage of convenience. In any case, this is a well done book. But not in the same league as Kearns Goodwin's book, which presented a more nuanced description of the two men's friendship."
2,Not much here,"This well written but superficial survey of the FDR/Churchill relationship, is most disappointing. For anyone who has read independently about FDR and about Churchill, there is nothing new here, no interesting new facts, no interesting new insights. Unfortunately, this felt like a book written just to write a book. It is possible, I suppose, that for a reader entirely ignorant about WWII and the role of the two English speaking leaders, there may be some value here."
2,much ado about nothing,"I must confess that this book was not a pleasure to read. The trivia portrayed in the Roosevelt-Churchill relationship was at times interesting and even amusing but when all is said and done both men made decisions NOT based on their supposed special relationship but on the needs of the day. Roosevelt was at first suspicious of Churchill, then came to be a fan or his, but turned again suspicious of Churchill as he pursued the courting of Stalin. I am not convinced that there really was a meaninful and consequential relationship between Roosevelt and Churchill. Without this relationship much the same would have probably occurred. Meacham does not demonstrate that his thesis is valid.Having recently read Meacham's analysis of the Jesus Question in Newsweek I am not surprised that his work here is superficial and jejune -- the work of a journalist not a scholar. He is a bright young man but doesn't have anything to say which would last more than a week."
2,A book in search of a reason to exist,"First off, I want to say the author can write well - which makes this book even more disappointing.The stated reason for the book is to discuss the personal relationship between FDR and Churchill - which is one of the most important friendships in history. But it actually doesn't dive in to the personal relationship that much.And for discussing a friendship, large chunks of time are jumped over with not much of a mention - yet during these periods there was ongoing communication between FDR and Churchill.I think I have learned more about the relationship between these two from reading other books about the war itself - and how command decisions were arrived at at the top.Bottom line - you will learn little from this book."
1,Doesn't remove the hair but sure does create a mess,"I typically shave, and I got sick and tired of having to shave so frequently. So I decided to try waxing. Well, I can now say that this product does not do such a great job removing the hair, but it sure does create a big old mess. Not worth any amount of money!"
1,AVOID THE KINDLE VERSION!,This is for the kindle version: Bought this at the beginning of the semester. Several of the equations are wrong. Defining constants are missing. VERY POORLY composed e-book. I have to double check everything with a paperback copy from a fellow student. many of the tables are blurry and you cannot zoom in with the application you are allowed to use( it allows only text zoom). I want a refund.
2,A little too basic,If this is for engineers they've must have meant 1st or 2nd year students. I wouldn't recommend this for seniors or professionals. I would recommend a more complete version which can be found right here in Amazon.com.
5,Good,Great price and condition. Shipped fast with Amazon Prime!I need it for the class I am taking. The class is a pain in the a**!
2,Far too basic,"Any book written ""for Engineers"" should assume at least a basic level of mathmatical knowledge and go from there. A better title might have been ""Introduction to MATLAB for the Junior High Student"""
4,Good for College Freshmen,"As a professor of engineering freshmen, I can absolutely state that this book is not too basic. It is a good introductory text and the best I have found, especially for those students who have little experience in programming (which are far and away the majority of my students.)"
5,jensen 9311ts ipod wire,veryyy fast shiping.. just got it and its great !!!!very easy to installl u plug it in the hide a way box and plug it in ur ipod and ur done !!!!about 2 mins to installi have the jensen 9311 touch screen works great with itif u got a ipod and jensen get itgreat priceon a scale 1 to 5 i give it a 5....... very worth it
4,"and you thought religious music was all about ""praise""","It is about religion, the book, why salvation is important.But this metal band is not on it's way to heaven.Classic 80's metal, kicks ass! Can you handle this speed metal?"
5,Best Training Tool,"I know it looks harsh but my dog weighs about as much as I do, and while she knows her commands, she doesn't always care to obey them. Her tugging was becoming an issue when I got hurt a few times. I did some research and as it turns out, the prong collar is actually totally humane. It replicates the alpha dog's correction so this caters to their instincts."
4,It Works,"Had to remove 1 link for my 125 lbs great dane. She pulled like an ox.Now my 8 year old can walk her.I DO get judge-y looks sometimes, but screw them."
4,Pretty good dog collar.,"I think that the dog collar works good. My dog is REALLY stubborn but it seems to do the trick. He ignores it sometimes though, but like I said he's extremely stubborn. He is a husky and they are just that way. BUT... it has made him calm down and walk now so that my daughter can walk him by herself so that is a major plus and huge improvement. I would recommend it."
1,Did not work for St Bernard,I got this for my Saint Bernard. It did not stop him from chasing after other dogs and resulted in a broken wrist for me when he pulled the leash out of my hand. I guess I will try other methods.
2,Wish I'd known about other options years ago,"Training? Pain is not the same thing as training.This will make your dog stop pulling quickly, but it will hurt him and it may make him more reactive in the long term. If other dogs make him forget about the collar and pull then he may learn that other dogs mean pain, and this can cause problems.Try this: get a gentle leader head halter or a halti. When your dog pulls stop walking. Be patient. Your dog will learn that pulling does not pay, with no pain and no fear! What's more once he does well on the halti you can switch to a normal collar and he won't forget what he learned!*****meant to give one star! 2 stars is too many."
3,Subtitles that will make you go blind,"The portions of the movie where the Japanese are speaking, are subtitled. The subtitled text is nearly impossible to read, mostly because of its size and color. The small, white text is very difficult to read, and is moreso when shown with lighter colors in the background.Outside of that, the movie's sound and video direction was good."
4,See it now.,This movie was fine.The action was great and I was at the edge of my seat and the love story was okay.Go ahead and buy this movie because its great.
4,Don't let the Bermuda Triangle fool you.,"All in all,I was quite happy with the movie.Don't listen to the critics because they're crazy people."
3,Pearl Harbor DVD pros and cons,"This DVD is quite nice. It has 2-3 discs depending on which one you get, and the 3 disc cams with a National Geographic map of Pearl, with timeline and a type of score board of the damaged ships. There are a number of documenaries which are very good, and more. (BUT)this has the most insulting thing I have ever seen in a DVD before, it is that the movie is only about 3 hours long but it is cut between two discs. Now, I can name at least 5 other movies that length or longer that are of one disc, one side, and you can see it from start to finish with out flipping or switching so needless to say I was quite insulted, but still a good film."
2,Titanic Wannabe,"Clearly, Michael Bay was reaching for his own Titanic with Pearl Harbor: A tragic romance set against a national tragedy. Well, it didn't work. The romantic story is too soap-opera, the acting a bit over-the-top and the whole movie was just too darn long. The effects are outstanding, the only saving grace, but not enough to justify watching the movie. If you're interested in Pearl Habor, I mean really interested, rent Tora! Tora! Tora! Keep Michael Bay's plastic version at, well, bay."
5,The perfect bass,"This bass is perfect for a young or old man. It's serious, big and have a great sound. It's a great bass!"
2,I hated it..,"I found this novel quite pointless. It is about a quite ordinary but heartless man named Monsieur Meursault whose mother dies. After the funeral he befriends a gangster named Raymond and as a result of getting mixed up with him, he ends up senselessly, somewhat by accident, and because of the blinding hot sun, killing another man. His trial, his stay in jail and the results of all this are narrated throughout. But I could not feel any sympathy for the man. Find something else to read; this one is pointless."
5,Tout simplement exquis!,"Quel roman savoureux. Du passé simple, j'en prendrais volontier. Un incontournable."
2,"Great book, false advertising by Amazon","The books is a classic, wonderful read as always. My problem is that the ""Look Inside"" on Amazon's page makes it seems as though this edition includes an introduction (in English) as well as a guide to understanding some of the French phrases. The edition I received today had none of this. It is, very simply, the original French text. No additional material. Just a heads up."
5,"Aujourd'hui, Maman est morte.","What a way to begin a story?! And what can one say about Camus that hasn't already been said? This is a great novel filled with observations, images and actions carefully stitched into words by a master narrator. If you're a novice to French literature, this is a perfect place to begin."
3,Great taste and keeps you full,I've been using this product for over a year and I only gave it three stars because they've gone up on the price without increasing the amount of packets in the box.
3,They Forgot to Mention Corn Syrup Solids,"I just received my order of Lean Body for Her MRS and decided to take a look at the ingredients list. Even with my tired old eyes I spotted ""corn syrup solids"" in the list on the box. What's that all about? It was exactly what I didn't want. Look above in the ingredients list and you'll see that it's missing. I got the Chocolate and haven't checked the strawberry or vanilla, but I'll bet corn syrup solids is listed on those ingredient lists on those boxes, too. Is this some kind of trick? I'll use what I purchased, but I'm not impressed at all with this bit of business. In looking at other meal replacement shakes I remember some of them said ""no corn syrup solids."" Now I know what they were talking about. Buyer Beware."
5,Yummy & Satisfies!,"This is hands down the best tasting protein shake I have ever had! I do suggest mixing it with icy cold water in a simple blender bottle. You can do skim milk, but there's really no need. It is smooth, rich, thick and keeps me very full. I like that it isn't a high sugar cintent and it provides a great source of low fat energy boosting protein. There is nothing weird in this shake that gives people the jitters. I work in a business where I can't always sit down and eat a big meal, so this shake is quick, nutritious and simple. Best of all it really keeps me satisfied, and keeps me from snacking on crappy foods. By the time I get home I am still energized enough to do my workout. This shake is helping me keep my lean muscle and burn off my excess fat. One of my friends recommended this shake for me and I am so glad she did. I can take the little protein shake packets anywhere and convenience is SO key."
2,"OK if blended with something (i.e., strawberries)","I didn't like the thickness or the flavor, compared to another protein powder that I was used (Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Vanilla). Perhaps this is the nature of all meal replacement shakes--not sure.Easy to use/carry, mixes well (no lumps), and mixes with water (rather than requiring milk)"
1,Maggots with powder,"I loved the flavor of the vanilla shakes until one of my packages had dry maggots in it, which makes me be seriously concerned about the cleanliness of the facility that packed the protein powder-- or about the origin of the protein in the pack. Would give Labrada negative stars if I could."
3,"Labrada Nutrition Lean Body For Her Meal Replacement Powder, Strawberry, 1.7-Ounce Packets (Pack of 20)","Bought this for my wife. Tried them. Taste good but way overprice. Get optimum nutrition(ON) protein instead. ON's whey taste good, dissolve easily and they have a whole lot of different flavors. If money is not an issue these are not bad."
2,"I really, really tried","I do not like the flavor. I love vanilla ice cream/ shakes. This shake however, doesn't even compare in a natural goodness. It is chalky and harsh. I even tried blending in strawberries. The flavor of the shake was too powering over the strawberries. I would be open to trying the chocolate...but not at this price."
5,Very Satisfied,"I am a regular user of the Lean Body shake and was pleasantly surprised when I ordered the product this time. Amazon had sent the new and improved version I couldn't get at my local vitamin store. It tasted 100% better! I'll order it here from now on - as they have the newest, freshest product available."
2,Only OK,Lean body is ok. I purchased the chocolate and the consistency kind of makes me sick. The flavor is decent.
1,Demote Capt. Invincible to a Private.,"First off, I want to state that I have seen other reviews for this movie elsewhere - and many people like it. I suppose that, no matter how bad a movie is, there will always be someone who likes it. I just am not of that ilk.I love superhero movies, and I like some musicals - but this is the first combination I have ever seen of both. The humor was ""far beyond that of mortal man"" (it sucked). It could have been possible to make a pretty good movie using the premise of a dishonored old drunk of an ex-superhero - but this one missed the mark entirely.If you are a fan of Rocky Horror Picture Show - you MIGHT like this. If you are a completest and want to get to know Captain Invincible - and you can get it REAL CHEAP - go for it. That which doesn't kill you . . . . and all that."
1,faulty,"this product arrived in a timely manner. It would have been a great item with the acception that I had to drill the hole for the stock swivel in the bolt ,didnt have a hole to install swivel 1"
4,Does what they say,Basic simple set up. Finish is not that great but they do the job they were intended to do. All steel construction nice sling swivels.
5,super number 1 !!!,"super good quality, very very nice addition to my rolling thunder. Very much worth every dollar spent, and will surely hold up as well if not better than factory parts."
5,Good buy,I bough this for my Maverick 88 and installed easily. The sling snaps rigt on and swivel feature is nice. Does a nice job and a solid buy.
4,Received as described and ahead of schedule.,"It worked well with my Mossberg 500 12 Gauge Pump-Action Home Defense Shotgun. That gun already had a tapped hole in the action slide tube nut, so I didn't need to use the nut provided. I just had to screw in and tighten the sling loop hole provided in the kit. Very easy, took < 5 mins."
3,Good quality swivels,"These bad boys match my Mossberg 500 blued finish almost perfectly. The they great and will work great.Upon inspecting the parts carefully I will comment on each part individually.Sling Swivels: These look to be of great quality which is most important. Great finish, tight clearance so they dont swivel right away but after some use, the will work great. The tight clearance shows a sign of good machining, which is a good.Magazine tube attachment: I would rate the actual threaded bolt that caps off the magazine tube to be of less quality than the Mossberg part. The Mossberg threaded easier and had a much better knurling around it (used to grab onto an twist on/off.) I ended up threading the swivel attachment off and installing onto my Mossberg stud.Retaining washer: Looks to be sub quality compared to Mossberg again. I threw it away and retained my mossberg washer.Good value for the price and will get the job done."
4,Need to Check the Thread Size,I had read the reviews on this product before purchasing and notice many were having a problem with threading the barrel retaining bolt into the magazine tube. When I received mine I also experienced the same problem. I took a die and ran it over threads and sure enough several hairlike shavings came off along with the bluing. The bolt can now be threaded without cross threading. A drop of gun oil should inhibit any rust. All and all good product.
3,Swivels Work as Advertized,"Installed easily. The magazine bolt was easy to change out and drilled a hole in the wood stock for the stud. Seems sturdy enough. However: I subtracted 2 stars for the ""...manufactured in America"" ""keeping jobs in America"" swill when the package clearly states ""Made In China""."
5,Easy installation and great delivery,I received very fast the order from the vendor. I installed this to my Maverick 88 and this was very easy since this kit include all the parts and TOOLS. it took me approx. 10 minutes to install all. 5 start to the vendor.
4,Adventuring in the Pacific : Polynesia Melanesia Micronesia,"""Adventuring in the Pacific"" is the only book I've found, to date, that covers information about the South Pacific and Oceanic Islands from as far east as Tahiti in Polynesia, to as far north-west as the Northern Mariana's in Micronesia, covering many of the more remote or unfamiliar islands in between. The book contains a wealth of information that is vital to the traveler such as travel tips, length of stay considered adequate for each island, flora & fauna, native foods, and even important information about crime and health issues that may be encountered. Additionally, it includes an in depth look at the culture and history of each island. I would have preferred seeing more detailed maps, more weather information and pictures of the islands, but for anyone planning to visit or sail throughout the South Seas, or if you're just an island ""buff"" it is well worth the purchase."
4,Interesting and even relevant - if you have the money !,"No doubt interesting reading. Whether it's relevant... Well, yes, this could be great advice for those adventuring in the Pacific, but only with huge amounts of money which few of us have. Unless you have your own yacht(s) etc, you may be better off with one of the more 'conventional' travel guides."
5,Vintage,"A Rare piece for any Sci-Fi Fan, like me. I recomend the aquisition of this book. One true guide for all fans of Sci-Fi."
1,Is this a joke?,"This ""game"" is like a Saturday Night Live skit. A bright red and yellow star claims ""with Limited Gameplay!"" as if it were a feature. Whichever marketer labelled this game is an a-hole, and I hope his or her children get very disappointing and mis-marketed ""games"" for their next birthday."
4,Basic introduction to 3D and OpenGL,"As a basic introduction to 3D and OpenGL, it isn't bad. It doesn't cover advanced OpenGL features (for example picking) or 3D concepts. Beware of the faulty 3D rotation matrices for y and z."
3,A Good Message Wrapped ina Love Story,"Although at first I doubted the probability of this wealthy girl marrying an uneducated stable hand, Arana handles the story in a way that I believed. She documents the difficulties of an immigrant, and the prejudices, with sensitivity. I found myself drawn to the prayer-warrior grandmother, and I liked how Arana portrayed the woman. The husband, Antonio, while uneducated is intelligent, and untainted by American culture, he reveals a strong, child-like faith.The second book in the Regalo Grande series, In the Shade of the Jacaranda delivers a simple message wrapped in a story of love: Believing IN God isn't enough-you have to believe God."
5,Bring this lovely creation back in print!,"Kay Hagan's book is a magnificent work, with such a wonderful variety of reflective writing exercises, and ample space to explore right in the book. I met the author at a journal conference long ago, and was introduced to parts of the book before it was published. For many years, I have used the finished product in my journal classes, as a guide for men and women who are exploring self and creativity. Unfortunately, it is now out of stock at the publisher and is not readily available. But I hold tight to my last copy and continue to write again and again, using Kay's imaginative weekly exercises as my beginning."
2,Copied from a VHS tape?,"1994, eh. This has got to be copied off a VHS tape from a TV broadcast. Most likely a grainy 4:3 picture with so so 2 channel sound to BOOT,,,,leg. They all are pretty much the same. Find a nice copy of Live in Vencie 1989 instead for about $12."
4,works,"Bought these for my daughter who was starting to go to bed without training pants. Its not as absorbant as the hospital type of pads. More than moderate amount of urine can spill over and leak onto sides. Overall, except for that one incident when my daughter had a lil too much pee on the bed, it's done its job. I use it as a pad for my trunk now."
3,Product changed,"I reordered this product but it was different this time around, the pink protective side is much softer, but also doesn't hold place as well in the bed as the older version did."
1,Disappointed O Hentry Fan,"This is one of my favorite O Henry stories and I think the only thing this movie has in common with the book version is the title. They changed much of the story, added characters, etc. With such a wonderful cast of actors I was expecting so much more. I was hoping to read the story and then share this movie with my class, but this is NOT O Henry or anything close to it!"
3,The Ransom of Red Chief DVD,"The video is adorable; I showed it to my students after reading the short story in class. It arrived a day late, even though I paid the extra money for quicker delivery, and the disk gets stuck and skips.Since I couldn't find the movie anywhere in town, I guess that ""beggars can't be choosers!"""
5,SOOO FUNNY,I love this movie. I laughed so hard when I saw it. I admit it is very stupid but that only makes it more fun. There is no real deep story line and all of the charecters are dumb and dumber. All in all it is just pure good intertainment. Fun for the whole family.
3,Not too funny comedy.,"Comedy suitable for the whole family, but unfortunately not too funny. Supposedly based on a story by O. Henry, this was apparently made for TV and later remarketed on DVD to exploit the young Osment's new fame after he starred in Sixth Sense. It takes place in the old west, when Christopher LLoyd (Taxi, Back To The Future) and Michael Jeter think they can make a fast fifty by kidnapping the banker's son (Osment). But the banker doesn't believe them. Meanwhile the kid's having a grand old time playing with his kidnappers. Kind of like Disney's No Deposit, No Return; not as funny."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This had to be the worst, most awkward movie I have ever seen. I could not even stand to watch the whole thing. It does not even stay true to the short story it is based on."
3,O. Henry would be disappointed.....,"In my 8th grade English class, my students read O. Henry's ""The Ransom of Red Chief,"" every year. The kids LOVE the story, and laugh right out loud. When I showed the video in class, they were extremely disappointed. The movie is quite different from the short story. It's a cute little movie, but it in no way compares to reading the selection orally in class. They thought the movie was fun, but they were looking for it to be much closer to the real thing. However, my kids learned a valuable lesson that made my heart SING!....The book is ALWAYS better than the movie!"
2,Look for another text,"My cohort in an 2-year MS Stat program almost universally hated this text (of us all, I was probably the one least opposed to it). Hocking skipped too many steps for us (""It is easy to see ...""). He often takes a geometric approach, but presents it at a level that was incomprehensible to any of us (including our professor). I don't doubt Hocking knows what he was talking about, or even that some other readers might, but it was beyond all of us, many of whom as undergrads majored in math or statistics, for what that's worth.For theory of the linear model, consider Rencher and Schaalje's Theory of the Linear Model, which is extremely thorough and clear, has solutions to all exercises, great for self-study It doesn't cover all the material that Hocking does, though."
1,Things that don't work,"This pedometer not only counted my steps incorrectly, but it counted them when I was sleeping! Imagine my surprise when I woke up and found I had walked about 10 steps in my sleep. It also would reset itself all by itself, usually in the middle of a walk. There is no protective cover for that, there was no way to adjust for your stride. Cheap it as and well worth the cheap. I returned it. PS I also could not add any tags to this review. The program would not allow me to."
1,Worst pedometer ever,"I have owned at least a dozen pedometers, and this is the worst. It counts, at best, one of five or six steps. I even fiddled with the stride length in hopes of tricking it to work. But it still undercounted by half or more at the end of the day. Furthermore, I wrote the company to register my complaint, and I never received a response. This pedometer needs to die a quick death. And the company needs to be more responsible."
1,Not so good,"You have to run to count right. It's not so sensitive, you have to walk almost jumping to work. When you run, it's ok."
1,Awful,"Just a bad product. Wish I'd read the reviews before I bought it. Like others say, this will reset at the lightest touch of the exposed reset button. Try to take it off your belt, and it will read 00000 by the time it's off. Worthless."
1,Might as well have made the reset button red!,"I typically don't write reviews when I have nothing new to add. I usually reserve my opinions for products that are significantly good or significantly bad. Unfortunately, this is one of the latter cases.I agree with others who have said that this pedometer is a little too sensitive. Somehow it counted 35 steps this morning from my bed to the bathroom, which takes me all of about 10 real steps to get to. The day I bought it (yesterday) it had reset when I bent over to untie my shoes because the reset button is so big, and the day I threw it out (today) I accidentally reset it when I was taking it off while changing clothes.Normally, too, if I'm going to write a negative review, then I'll try to offer up an alternative. Not this time. For one, I have yet to buy another step pedometer, but I'm fairly confident in saying that ANY pedometer will serve you better than this one!"
1,Poor Design,"Poor Design.The Sportline 330, if slightly bumped, will reset to zero. If you want a reliable pedometer DO NOT buy the Sportline 330."
1,It died in 3 weeks,"I purchased the Sportline Walking Advantage 330 pedometer from a local sporting goods store about 3 weeks ago. This morning it died. Even if it hadn't died I would not recommend it because most days it would reset itself to 0 steps at some point in the day. It could be that I accidentally reset it, but if so, it was too easy to do by accident."
1,useless,"My Sportline 330 gets reset at least two or three times a day, because it's so easy to accidently press the button. The instructions say that you have to press it for two seconds to reset, but that's not the case -- a brief touch will do it. It was a total waste of money."
5,BoaC & Don= Pure Magic!,"I wasn't very deep inside BoaC music. I bought this because of Don, and SURPRISE! Bang on a Can really swings hard.I strongly recommend this album to all jazz & open minded music lovers.Halowdance"
5,Dog Lover,"This book is great for anyone who loves animals, especially dogs. Zeus is a guide dog for your soul. Each page makes you smile."
4,sturdy chair,"Love how easily it folds flat. It is very sturdy and comfortable, only reason it didn't get five stars is the back is just a bit low, at least for me. A few more inches and it really would be great!"
2,Outnumbered!,"I recently pulled out my 1979 LP and had a listen to this album. First time in probably almost 30 years. I was in absolute stitches! My two sons came down to have a listen and both sort of said ""alrighty now Dad!"" Knowing my tastes in music they were puzzled as to why I even had this LP.What a dated contrived piece of sonic crap that has not aged well one bit! To be fair, I do like Annie Haslam's contribution...Ooo ahh ooo ahh, COME ON NOW!!! Time to rise, time to wake up?... All conditions blue, it's up to you? Most of the lyrics are downright painful! laze guitars? Garbage...in MY lp collection from thirty years ago...what was I thinking? Hell if I know!"
2,Mixed Feelings,"It's weighty and cute, but the chain is flimsy, its a bit smaller than in the movie, and the coloring is a little off. I think its a good gift for children."
4,Price Seems Good,I'm not writing a true review on this since i didn't buy this exact one but i am looking into buying one for my sister bc she likes mine. This one looks like mine and which is really nice but actually cheaper and I got mine from the store for the ride at Disney in Florida. However I only got the coin and not the necklace and mine was only about 2-3 dollars cheaper. So going off of what everyone else says i would buy it bc it sounds like a decent piece and going off of wht i know for price i think i will get this one bc it is one of the cheapest ones i have seen and i know wht the retail price for them is.
3,Disappointed,"""This is smaller than the coin it is replicating...for a kid it would be ok...but for a replica the carving is a little muttled...i was surprised disney put this out as a replica...they usually do a better job."""
2,A nice necklace,"This is a nice piece as well for pirates of the caribbean. I got one for me a long time ago, then I got one for both of my nieces and they love it. It's a nice piece for child or adult."
5,Beautiful!,"I love this necklace...I had purchased one at Disney, but it was on a sturdy chain, not like the delecate chain on this one. This version is like the one Elizabeth Swan wears in the movie. Great replica! Fun!"
1,Not to good!,I bought this for my 9 year old and the chain is not sturdy. It was broken after just one day. The charm is not as large as I thought it would be. I wish I had not made this purchase.
1,not bad,Cheap decoration for my pirate theme room. Like the look but did not come with link chain as shown. Was going to give it to my girlfriend but only came with a cheap chord.
1,Don't be deceived!,"The detailed pictures showing for this item are not of the Master Replica coin that is being sold. The pictures look much better than the MR coin necklace. The MR coin is VERY shiny and glossy and does not have much detail. I'm not sure what brand the coin in the pictures for this item are, but I think the one with the chain is the Raven Blackwood necklace.You will be disappointed if you buy this necklace and are expecting it to look like the close-up picture--IT DOESN'T!"
2,Repititive,"This book is very repititive. If you like books in which things are repeated, this is the book for you because things are repeated in it. This book says the same thing in different ways. Similar ideas are stated in different ways many times in the book. Although stated differently, many times, a sentence states the same idea that was stated previously. This happens many times. Many many ideas are repeated many many times. It gets redundant."
4,Disability model is missing,"Luhrmann compares and contrasts the biomedical and the psychodynamic in psychiatric training. The focus is compelling. The author starts from the assumption of medicine that these are illnesses. Service user diagnoses -- schizophrenics, borderlines -- replace the person; a family organizataion is described as a patient lobby, she notes that is clear to her that these are diseases and the medical model works. The last chapter tries to redress, and she has interviewed and quotes California clients John Hood, Vernon, and Howie, but she uses professional distancing jargon -- high-functioning and dysfunctional, .... I felt they were diminished. Missing is the model of managing and accommodating disability. Missing is the fuller context - where these psycho-science approaches fit when the spiritual and social dimension are included."
1,"Fighting scenes are slow, not exciting. The plot is typical of this genre.","The fighting scenes are slow, not exciting. The plot is typical of this genre. In short, it's not worth it.I prefer the ones made in 90s and the 21st century such as Iron Monkey, Flashpoint, etc."
2,Neither just scandinavian nor rage,"Aksel Sandemose is surely a Norwegian writer, as he always wrote in Norwegian, but as he himself states in one of the later editions of ""A refugee crosses his tracks"" he based the book on his own upbringing in the small town Nykobing in Denmark.Ultimately there is nothing Danish, Norwegian or Scandinavian about it - it is just what can happen to everyone growing up in a small town surrounded by a lot of small minds. And the feeling of wanting to pay back those who made your childhood a nightmare doesn't need a lot of analysis.But Aksel Sandemose's ""A refugee crosses his tracks"" definately makes you think about it twice before you judge other people just from their appearance... I can recommend that book to everyone interested in expanding her or his mind."
1,Correction,"I have not read this book by R. Birn, but I'm a norwegian and what the guy who wrote his rewiev is a little bit wrong, first of all. Aksel Sandemose was only born and raised in Denmark, he moved til Norway quite young and lived there for about five years before he wrote the law of Jante. And it is based not on his own expirence, but what he saw in Norway. He must therefore be concidered a Norwegian author.Thank's"
3,"Decent, could have been better, Vague in some aspects","Pretty good buy as a reference point to some 60 something law firms in the southeast. There is approx 2 pages per firm that details pro (mentors, hands on experience, decent hours, office comaraderie) and cons (insane hours, low retention rates for minorities or women, sweatshop). The salaries are somewhat dated. The book has maybe 1 or 2 comments per firm from their attorneys. Very vague on who they hire - though a ""good personality"" is often repeated. Some do say top 10% from a good school."
5,A Fabulous Exploration,"James MacRitchie is one of our gifted interpreters of the secrets of ancient China. This is his third book on Chi Kung - Qigong, the mother of Tai Chi. His exploration of the Qi (Chi) cultivation arts is assisted by 22 of the most impressive luminaries on this suject in the modern era -- Jahnke, Johnson, Garripoli, Winn, Weil, etc. MacRitchie's incredible crafting of his own writing, the writing of this impressive team of experts, the illustrations and photographs, creates one of the more definitive of the contemporary books on the subject of Qigong and its roots into the deep and rich soil of Chinese philosophy, medicine and culture."
4,Pretty,I love it...very pretty. Be careful though glass is easily breakable...i had to buy a second one b/c i broke the glass. But the silver part without the glass works well too.
1,Shame on Amazon for Charging $5 for this Lousy 1-Pager!!,"That's all it is, a simple, 413-word, 1-page, 4-question interview with authors Goldsmith and Eggers. Their book is superb, but this ""interview"" is thin gruel and not even worth 50 cents."
3,24-Inch Road Bike,"This is a good deal for the young road enthusiast that wants to go ride with a parent. Some recommendations I have to make are with the brakes and the derailleurs:You will need to put new lockwashers on the brake caliber bolt because the calipers don't stay in position to keep the rim in the center. The way it comes, one brake pad always rubs the rim after you squeeze the brakes once.Adjusting the derailleurs is a task, they are rudimentary and borderline quality, have a bike shop do it if you can't.You may pay $30- $40 to get it running right. I bought one of my kids a Trek KDR for $600 and it has a better groupo and free lifetime adjustments from the bike shop, but with the cost difference, the Denali is a better deal."
5,WHAT A GREAT DEAL!,"We are THRILLED with the GMC Denali Boy's 24-Inch Road bike. It looks amazing, rides like a professional bike. It was a breeze to put together (my husband wasn't home and me and my 10 year old son did it together in about 15 minutes). He is small for his age and had no problems reaching brakes or pedals. He is thoroughly enjoying it. We have several friends who race road bikes and they can't compliment it enough. I HIGHLY recommend this bike to anyone!"
3,glen 1601,"great beginner bike for my 9 year old. needs tweeked out of the box. will up grade some componets as my child developes his riding skills, but overall great bike at a even better price"
2,Better books out there,"I am in the business of service excellence. I study it, I preach it and I teach it to my clients. While this is an ok book, there are many others that are better in my humble opinion. The Disney Institute series, the Disney Magic/Disney Service books and the knock your socks off series are exceptional books on the subject of creating the wow factor for service that will turn customers into your biggest fans."
1,This guy expects a little too much from the working world.,"A chapter-by-chapter adventureinto situations where ""someone""didn't bend over backwards tokeep this guy as a customer. In all honesty, I'm not certain I would want him in my place of business. In fact, I'm not certain his errogance would fit through the door."
4,Great Tips on Preventing Customer Service Problems!,"This is a must read for every business owner. None of the ideas in this book are ground breaking, but the authors does a great job of explaining how they translate into loyal customers for your business. This book will help you create systems in your business to avoid customer service problems in the first place. This book was originally published in 1998 and has been updated three times since, selling over 1 million copies worldwide. Every business owner should have this book, and I'd also recommend buying copies for all your employees as well.Melinda Emerson ""Smallbizlady""AuthorBecome Your Own Boss in 12 Months: A Month-by-Month Guide to a Business that Works"
4,Great Practical Application of Service,"This book cuts through all the theory and gives a real life view of someone who is passionately dedicated to service and shows how service drives superior business. All the business theories come to life through real life examples from Carl Sewell's business experience. It is a down to earth book of how to see the true value of service to a business and how to think like a customer to deliver world-class service.Since he is the boss over his firm, there are a few things that need to be modified or adapted to fit in the corporate world to be practical.Overall, a good read. It will energize you in thinking about service as a strong business tool."
5,Great!,"This book gives valuable insight into what a customer really wants and thinks. I would recommend this book to anyone who works with customers, employees and employers alike! Often we forget who really pays your paychecks. (Hint: It's not your boss!)"
5,solid material from Voigtlander,"Cant complain at all about this piece. Fine cut metal, screws in tight to my Voigtlander E mount to Leica mount adapter. I only have one Lens(Voigtlander ultra wide heliar 12mm original) for this adapter and i love the set up of the lens and my sony nex 7. Voigtlander seems to be a good match for the nex line and have done a good job and quality to match many different camera types. this piece looks like camera jewelry to me. the set up of my black nex 7 on the brushed aluminum finish of the Voigtlander lens set up looks really nice, and the pictures look even better. recommend this if you need an adapter. yes it has a high price, but i don't think i would be happy with a product of cheaper design."
4,Great DVD but no plans......,"This is a great DVD, but the one reason I can't give it 5 stars is becuase there's no plan. I had to sit and write down all the measurements down as I watched.I agree with the other reviewer, that you an learn a whole lot just by watching, but if you actually want to build the router table, be prepared to sit and write down all the measurements."
1,mostly an advertisement for Kreg... no plans included,This DVD is a big disappointment. It spends more time advertising Kreg products than building a router table. It also did not include the plans for the table that it said were included. Without the plans the video is virtually worthless. I do not recommend this DVD.
2,Not his best effort.,"I can't put my finger on why I didn't like this book. I like his other books (Great Apes and Grey Matter are great). You can't help, but feel dirty after reading a book like this, yet there was little humor or even interesting perspective to lighten the blow. I found this to be creepy and not in a good way. Maybe I was just in a bad mood..."
3,Dont buy this!,"These looks great online but when you see it in real life, they're extremely ugly. The black is not contrasting and sometime its bunch up together. Poor quality! Looks bad! What a dissapointment! Well, the only good thing about it is ""no slip"""
2,Copycat fantasy movie,"""Willow""tries to be just like great fantasy films like""Hobbit"",and ""Neverending Story"".Unfortunately,""Willow""falls flat on its face.The story intended to be good,butit kept plodding along,taking forever to get to certain partsof the storyline(the 25-minute scene where the soldierswere turning into pigs,the 20-minute scene where the browniedrank beer,the 30-minute scene of the 2 sorceresses fighting,etc).Perhaps if the movie-makers kept the storylines shorter,this movie would'nt been more enjoyabel.There are a couple ofof hilariuos moments,but they only last about a couple of minutes.The special effects are okay,and the evil queenwas only half-convincing.Advice:Rent this movie."
2,Stupid,Another film with great production values struggling to hold up a defective screenplay carried by a pathetic script and mediocre acting.It's somewhat hard to sympathize with an undersized hero whose voice sounds like that of a wailing sheep: ba-ah-ah-ah-ah-d. The film is supposed to take place in some fantasy past but the script spews out modern idioms and values out of the characters displacing them even more from the context of the story. The final scene with two women fighting against each other as if they were professional boxers was even more atrocious bringing the film down into the pits of vulgarity. The only good role and acting in this film was by Val Kilmer.Stay away from this pathetic film: it's not even worth renting. Watch the 'Lord of The Rings' trilogy or 'Dragonslayer' instead of this putrid crap.
2,Two Old Ladies,"I've seen this movie several dozen times. I remember the two-headed monster and the morphing special effects.What I remember the most, though, is two old ladies fighting. It's rather comical, if you think about it."
2,Bad Movie,"It boggles the mind why so many people liked this movie so much. It has a small cast of one-dimensional characters, an overused storyline, bad acting, and laughable special effects. Don't watch it."
5,A Legendary Fantasy Film,"I can say truly that I have never met anyone who did not like the movie Willow. I've been a fan since the first time I saw it some 10+ years ago.The amazing scenery, the antics of Willow and the comedy of the brownies Rool and Franjean all blend well to make this a great film. An extra touch is an earlier role by Val Kilmer and fans of his will definately not be disappointed at seeing this film.I would recommend this film to anyone who even has the slightest interest in the fantasy genre. It is truly a classic.-Zilean"
5,Best movie of all time!!!!!,"Willow is by far one of the best movies I have ever laid eyes on. My daughter is named after Alora Dannon in the movie. Now tellme I don't love this movie. I never get tired of watching it, I am just as amazed by it the 1st,2nd, and 100th time I see it. Please release this movie so that the millions of us who love it so much can have it for our collections."
5,rerelease Willow,"I can't believe this isn't available for sale, I've been searching for years. Give us a break and put in on the market! People who haven't seen it are missing out."
5,WOW BRO!!,"This movie has got to be the best movie of all time. skeletons and stuff and midgets and badguys and magic. it has everything!! I totally forgot about this film and one day the theme song was stuck in my head for some reason and I couldn't figure out where it was from. then I was like oh man!! WILLOW!!that movie ROCKS. I'm sure all of you have had the same thing. but anyway, this movie has got to be one of the most classic films of the 80s early ninties. wow bro!"
5,fantasy movie,"Love this movie-watched it first so many years ago. I think it was Val's first or one of his first movies. I love this kind of movie. Fantasy movies are the best. It is funny, romantic and you will love it."
4,"Willow, Fantasy film done right..","The first film I remeber Val Kilmer in and he was cast just right. A scoundrel gone right type of deal.. It works good for his style of acting.There's something for everyone in this movie, brownies for the kids, a few good guy fights with humor, as well as some romance for the ladies.."
4,Willow,Not only did I receive this item before the time I was suppose to recieve it but it came in very good condition.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Now that Willow's special effects (its major selling point at the time, are dated and fairly unimpressive, the movie is really not worth watching; Val Kilmer is fun enough but the story is really pretty derivative."
5,Willow,"I love this movie. It is a great way to send the message that the lease likely, possibly the most weak can have great power if they have a good heart."
5,midget returns a normal size baby to a big adult,"I think that warwick davis was funny and kicked a$$ in the movie. Ecspecially when he fights the little trolls. It was funny when the baby barfed on one of the fat midgets and when a bird poops on the fat dude again. I think that all warwick davis's movies are the bomb, I really liked this one the most"
3,They should be sued,"I'm rating the movie in the middle, since I haven't seen it. I am more concerened about the advertisement on TV for this movie. They should be sued! Their ad goes something along the lines of ""Before there were hobbits..."" That is a downright lie. This movie came from teh mind of George Lucas. I highly doubt that Lucas came up with this BEFORE Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. Tolkien wrote those books about 60 years ago! How dare they try to pass off Tolkien's masterpiece as a play on Willow! That is outrageous!"
3,Fantasy,Val Kilmer stars in this sword and sorceery flick about a baby destined to overthrow Queen Bavmorda. The casting and costumes are excellent.
5,DVD from amazon,the item I purchased arrived in excellent condition and also in a very timely manner.
1,Is this the best they can do?,"I really wish Lucas had made a better movie than this. In fact he did, it was called Star Wars. Look at this movie and see the similarities to Star Wars. Willow is Luke Skywalker. Billy Barty is Obi Wan Kenobi. Val Kilmer is Han Solo. The two little faries are R2D2 and C3PO. And you can obviously see who the Darth Vader character is.I would have forgiven this if at least the story were watchable. Even when I saw this movie as a kid I found it hard care what happened it any of these characters. I really wanted to like this movie because I am a big fantasy fan. Unfortunately when Hollywood makes a fantasy movie 9 times out of 10 they make it silly beyond belief or so sappy that you wonder why they didn't just make a modern romance movie instead.If you want to see a real fantasy movie check out any of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Princess Bride, Excalibur or Conan the Barbarian (NOT the Destroyer.)"
1,ripped off,"Illegally sold outside of USA or Canada, unable to be played in Australia. Complete waste of money."
1,So lame it makes Jurassic Park III look like a classic,"Anyone old enough to remember the world before Star Wars should avoid this movie.Although it contained state of the art FX (like JP III), it's script is one boring rip off of many classic fairy tales , retold badly.It's the primer for how not to use ""Great FX"" to stop the story from engaging the audience.If you are an FX fanantic and really want to check them out just fast foward through the un-""dramatic"" dialogue."
1,Deplorable,"From the obvious rip-offs of Lord of the Rings, the Bible and lots of other standard quest fantasy (not to mention Star Wars), to the idiotic villains, to the lame special effects (including a ridiculous two-headed dragon named ""Ebersisk"", obviously Lucas knew these guys weren't going to be fans of this drivel), this is a really awful film. The script is terrible, the performances range from lame to embarassing, the whole thing reeks of a lack of imagination but a determination to make some kind of fantasy film cobbled together by people (or, I guess, a person) who really can be bothered to come up with anything new. If the Ewoks were the first sign that Lucas had lost his touch, ths was the second. We should have seen the Phantom Menace and it's Jar Jar Binks sense of things coming a mile away."
1,Avoid this Turkey,Willow was boring and cheesy when it came out and I can't imagine anyone but the biggest Val Kilmer fan in the world ever wanting to buy this flop. One of the other reviewers compares Willow to Star Wars. HAH! Not very likely! I think Howard The Duck would be a closer comparison.
5,Great Family Movie,"Sit down on a rainy Sunday afternoon with a bag of popcorn, pop in Willow and you will spend two very enjoyable hours with your family."
5,Willow,Outstanding movie for all ages. I love this movie and bought copies of it for all my grandchildren.
5,Another Lost Fantasy,"So many great films are disappearing. This is one of them. It was released on video in the usual pan and scan format and was released on laserdisc in widescreen. Both copies disappeared in a matter of months. I have managed to obtain a used copy of the video, and this film must be re-released in the widescreen format. So many films are disappearing, and with the eminent takeover of DVD, less and less widescreen films are available in VHS. I hope this film is an exception if it is ever rereleased."
5,RE-RELEASE THIS FILM!!,"This is easily the best movie I have ever seen. I have seen itmore times than I can count, and I still enjoy rewatching it.Please rerelease it so I can add it to my collection. Better yet - digitally remaster it and release a DVD version!"
1,Not as expected.,"The DVD frames froze throughout the movie. Unable to watch the movie all the way through, This is the first time I have purchased an item that was not to my expectations. I will probably not try buying anymore items which say Very Good. I will stick with New only."
4,.,"Dorky but enjoyable fantasy flick, competantly directed, with an effective, humorous script and a really entertaining performance from Val Kilmer (who comes off a lot like a medieval, more exasperated Han Solo, but without being an imitation in any way.) Pretty silly at points, but overall it's a good time, free of the Hollywood propaganda, banal ""hipness,"" and trite scripting that characterize the escapist adventure movies of today."
5,one of the best fantasy movies of its kind!!!,"being a big fan of fantasy, i found willow to be one of the greatest fantasy movies ever. i have a very old vhs copy of this movie that was recorded from television several years ago. i need the dvd! i can't stand old vhs quality! aaaaahhhhh"
5,Outstanding Fantasy,"I have found so often in the fantasy genre very few well done films.Most are second grade B movies. I recommend Willow to any fantasy filmbuff. Highly entertaining, great effects and acting even by the baby.Val Kilmer is suited for so many roles and his role as Madmartigan inthis film is no exception. Jean Marsh's role as Queen Bavmorda issimilar in ways that remind me somewhat of the evil queen in the SnowWhite story (only meaner). And of course we must not forget the role ofthe dwarf Willow Ufgood (the hero of the story) played by midgetWarwick Davis. This film held my attention through out it gets an allaround 5 from me."
4,A fun family treat,"If your kids are fans of Tolkein and C.S. Lewis as much as mine, they will love this movie. While a little corny at times, and with cpecial effects that don't match up to 2003 standards, the story is engaging and keeps things moving, and its ideal for kids from 5-12 years old. Of course, I enjoy it, as well. But then I'm a sci-fi/fantasy geek."
2,Paid for a NEW copy of this movie but received an obviously used one,"Wait a long time for this order to be filled. When received, it was obviously not a NEW copy (as I had paid for) as there was no seal on the DVD case and fingerprints on the DVD itself. Also, the case had sticky residue on the top of it.Contacted GoHastings. Took them a while to respond. While they offered to accept a return, they could not replace the DVD. Since this was a Christmas gift to our daughter, she decided to keep it.All in all, still not happy. Would think twice about ordering from this company again."
5,excellent,"i love this movie. i can watch it over and over without ever getting sick of it. it looks great on DVD. The storyline and special effects are interesting. Val Kilmer was very funny as Madmartigan. The parts of Willow, Sorsha, Bavmorda, and many others were played extremely well too. i recommend this movie for anyone. you will definitely enjoy it, even if you are not a big fan of fantasy."
5,Willow,i saw this movie as a child and have just finished rewatching it. despite whatever George Lucas has made recently this is a really amazing movie.
4,Good,"This movie is a good movie. It has good sets and good special effects, although I think it needs a little help in the story department. This movie stars Val Kilmer and done by George Lucas. It was released in 1988 and made pretty good money and has become a cult classic. These movies have become popular again because of the recent surge in fantasy movies. If you like this movie try Legend(1985) or Labyrinth(1986) and the newer ones harry potter and Lord of The rings. my suggestion BUY IT!"
5,good movie,"willow is an awesome movie... pure, classic fantasy, no confusion with sci-fi or any other element."
5,CLASSIC,"This movie is a classic for any child ages 8 and up. It has all the magic and fantasy that newer movies have, but more clean cut."
5,#1 on My DVD Wishlist,"When I bought my DVD player, I was asked by the sales person which DVD would I like to own. It was instantaneous, I told him ""Willow"". Since then I have tried to get it. Willow is the type of movie that is for the young at Heart, it has all the ingredients of good old fashioned fantasy adventure. I reckon the guys who made this movie should be the ones to make the Narnian Choronicles.Cheers"
4,Good movie,"A good movie with great actors(Kilmer),good f/x and a good story.The extras are right but the original featurette has a bad quality(maybe tranfered from video tape).Recommend to your friends."
5,review of a classic fantasy,The product was in great condition! No problems at all with the seller. It was also sent on time.
3,The Jungle Book meets Lord of The Rings,"Like I said, The Jungle Book meets Lord of The Rings...with out the music of course. The story of a human child who must be brought back to human civilization set among a medieval landscape with various creatures such as dwarfs and evil monster warriors. Many similarities to LOTR, such as the dwarfs being afraid of humans and evil warriors. I enjoyed it, but think it's more worth your time to watch The Jungle Book and Lord of The Rings (1-3) back to back. The ending was not worth it though. I mean c'mon, willow is a character you're supposed to root for, but I was left asking myself why? This is the story of an average Joe who sets out on an adventure and ends up not doing anything all too special.The Jungle Book (40th Anniversary Platinum Edition)The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)"
4,One of the best fantasy films,"I originally saw this movie when I was in 9th. grade. It is still one of my favorite movies of all time. I even read the sequel novels by George Lucas and Chris Claremont and it just brought back so many memories of when I saw it in the theater. I just hope it comes out in VHS soon, because I don't have a DVD player."
5,classic must have for all ages,"i grew up on this movie and i love it, my children will grow up on this movie as well as other classics such as princess bride , goonies and never ending story"
5,One viewing is not enough,"Willow is a giddy rampage through a medieval fantasy world. Everyone will laugh and cheer on Willow's kind hearted hero as he helps save a baby from a wicked queen. You'll love it whether you're a teenager, a parent looking to share a film with your kids, or a child. Like The Princess Bride, Willow transcends its genre. The movie is funny and inspirational. The baby is cute, the hero is a parent who learns to believe in himself, and the love story is delicious. You have to buy it because one viewing is not enough."
5,"The ""Star Wars"" of fantasy adventure movies",BRING BACK WILLOW! I have searched far and wide to find a copy of this magnificent film and have to yet to find one (to buy). This is one movie that demands re-release! One of the most compelling storylines in a fantasy movie ever and the final battle between Madmartigan and Kael is something NOT to be missed! The special effects in this movie were groundbreaking in that they introduced morphing and other great features. WILLOW must ride again! We demand re-release!
1,Not vegetarian.,"These vitamins contain cholecalciferol (D3), a form of Vitamin D that is animal-derived (from lanolin or fish). The vegetarian version of Vitamin D, ergocalciferol (D2), is derived from yeast."
4,Good book,This was a good book. Set at the very end of the vietnam and how we treated the people that fought with us. Makes you kinda mad how we treat people that depended on us. Worth your money
5,Great!!,I've used this product before and just love it! My shipment arrived quickly and the product was perfect and as expected. These were holiday gifts for co-workers and I've received rave reviews!!!
2,Too Harsh,"The oils used in this are very nice, but the sea salt is very harsh. It was too painful to use on my hands; I used it on my feet a couple of times. But I ended up just throwing it away."
4,Clayton Infinity Guitar Pick,I just got these picks. They are light which I like to use because I play in a townhouse and it keeps me a little quieter on the strumming.I like that these kinda have a texture on one side. Helps keep the grip on them easier.
4,Bangin' Jam,This track is another dope hit from The Federation and E-40. Hyphy is hella hot. I can't wait until I get a hold of the 916 Remix (gotta represent!)
3,Took forever to arrive,"Our dog likes these treats, but it took many weeks to receive the dog treats. To be totally fair, although I ordered the treats May 15, 2010, I received a reply saying that the treats would not ship until as late as September 20, 2010."
1,Merchandised never received,"Although the US Postal Service says the item was delivered, I never received it. I contacted Amazon Customer Service, and they promised to ship a replacement, but they never did. I contacted the USPS and opened a case with them. They have no idea what happened to the package. It was not signed for by anyone."
5,exactly as hoped,"I love this bedding but found it at macy's pretty late- they did not have the Euro shams so I was happy to find them at Amazon. Very expensive, but very nice."
4,The Essential Elvis,"A wonderfully melancholy journey to the heart of Elvis as he deals with human foibles as only he can. Soulful and beautiful, this album is a must for lovers of well written and executed ballads. On a technical note, the arrangements of the songs, especially the sparse piano throughout, add a unique touch. Costello's lyric writing and singing is at its best on this recording. highlights: Poor Fractured Atlas; The Other end of the Telescope."
3,he holds a pirate's cutlass,this is not my elvis costello...mine has sharp teeth and grins devilishly...but this album took me in...the first sounds of distorted angel define cool...poor fractured atlas hangs me head...
4,Dressing Up Venom In Pretty Packages,"No one can be as devastating with a phrase as Elvis Costello, and this album is no exception. While the music may sound pretty and innocent, the lyrics are anything but. The title track is absolutely gut-wrenching, and ""The Other End of the Telescope"" captures emotions with unbelievable accuracy. The album is not as accessable as some of his others, so casual fans may find it difficult at first. Stick with it, though. It is worth it."
3,Funny,All This Useless Beauty is my 2nd LEAST fav. EC CD HOWEVER... So far the bonus disc that comes with this reissue is one of my fav. CDs ever. It is simply great. I really think that the bonus discs should have been sold seperate from the reissues as I now have 3 or four (counting LPs) copies of some of these recordings. So the reissue I give a 2 and the bonus disc I give a 5 but since I feel bitter that Rhino is taking advantage of my EC addiction I round down to a 3 star review.
4,Received incorrect trimmer as well,"I, like the previous poster, ordered a Toro but received a Ryobi. In the process of trying to return it but not sure what kind of luck I will have. BTW, it is a great price but if the parts are as expensive as the previous poster suggests, then I would rather have what I ordered - a Toro.**Update**Customer service from seller was excellent. They explained why the Ryobi name is on the trimmer and I am happy with their explanation. For the price, it cannot be beat. Everything arrived as promised."
5,Berkely Fireline for Beadweaving,"I have purchased this fishing string for bead weaving purposes. Berkeley manufactures this string with a different label for bead weaving purposes. After contacting the company I found that it was in fact the same as the fishing string. This string is excellent for bead weaving with size 15 or 11 seed beads, especially if you have to weave through a bead several times. The string is very strong and long lasting."
3,Rating relative to other Fireline,"Basically, no less opaque than the other colors. This is white and quite visible, although the color may be less offensive than say Green to the fish. Not sure. Anyways, the clarify aspect is overhyped. I've used thousands of yards of Fireline so I feel that I know the line pretty well."
4,Not just for fish anymore,"The same product is available on small spools in bead stores for about 3x the price per yard. Terrific for beadwork: doesn't stretch like monofilament, has a little bit of friction to its surface so it doesn't slip out of the needle and square knots don't pull out, and has more structural integrity than silk so the needle can't accidentally go through a strand and get hung up. I do enough needleweaving, gourd-stitch, netting etc. that I will easily use this up. And if not, I'll fish with the rest.It's whitish, not transparent (I make see-thru raised patterns on some of my beadwork and was looking for a really invisible thread). However, it's pretty thin, especially considering its strength So it's the next best thing to something that doesn't show at all."
2,Couldn't handle the smell...,"Unfortunately I can't say if this product was effective or not, because we used it only once. The smell is so offensive and strong, something like medicated Gold Bond plus bug repellant times 10, that I couldn't bring myself to use it again. It's a shame, because I like most of the ingredients and I believe they would be helpful for eczema and general itchy skin, if only I could stop smelling it in every corner of the house."
4,The Cavalier's Cup,"An entertaining change of direction for Carter Dickson's irascible sleuth, Sir Henry Merrivale. It is a typically ingenious and baffling locked-room mystery centering on the fabulously valuable goblet of the title, and why a thief should NOT have stolen it when he had the chance; but for the most part, it resembles P.G. Wodehouse or possibly the Marx Brothers, as Dickson indulges himself in the manner of country-house farce. This is good fun on all levels. Those who have never read Dickson before should know that John Dickson Carr, the man behind the psedonym, ranks with Christie and Marsh among the greats of the golden-age detective novel, and was arguably more versatile than either. His speciality was the locked-room or 'impossible' crime, and he created two memorable detectives in Merrivale and the Chestertonian Dr. Gideon Fell. The latter stars in The Hollow Man (or in the US, The Three Coffins), one of his best."
1,Water all over the table,Design is poor. You will have water or whatever all over the table. We will never use it at the table. Dee
2,Little Usable Information,Nothing very innovative and very little information. More of a coffee table book although the picture on the cover is the best one in the whole book. Everything seems a little outdated but what should I expect with a copyright of 2002? Also I'm not sure why this book is priced so high. I bought it used and it's in pretty rough shape and still $15.
4,Great for the amatuer photographer,"As said before, didn't really cover studio portrait photography at all, but would be a great guide for the pet owner that wants to capture their pet at play. Having said that, for the non-professional, I would recommend this book."
4,Childhood Development Book,"I bought this book for a friend of mine who was about to have her first child. I am a speech-language pathologist, so I am versed in the language development of children. After reviewing a lot of child development books, found that most of them have TOO much information and read a little like a medical dictionary. The information in this book is brief, to the point, and easy to access. It also includes suggestions for activities to encourage development across a multitude of areas including fine motor skills, language, gross motor, and social. It is not a reference book for figuring out different ailments, more of a reference of what to expect at what age, from birth through 6 years of age."
5,A challenging book that can stabilize a floundering life,"This book is a concise integrative study contrasting a shallow short-sighted commonly-held view of happiness with the grounding nurturing notion of happiness that has guided mature Christians in all ages. The book is personal, candid, and broadly informed. It discusses biblical principles as well as comments from wise observers of life throughout history. There are discussion questions which can guide group use of this book. Highly Recommended."
5,Great Book for Group Study,"I was very impressed by Moreland and Issler's book, The Virtue of Happiness. I participated in a group discussion of the book, and it proved to have all the right stuff to make it a reflective and thoughtful topic of study. The writing is very clear and sharp, and the theme grabbed me right from the beginning. I still think about some of the principles and quotes in the book now two years after having read it. The American church community would do well to read this excellent treatise on what real happiness is and getting back to a classical definition that has nothing to do with pleasurable experiences but everything to do with character and conduct and a life well chosen."
4,Unique and Creative,"With some independently released albums including a very charming one for children, The Harmonica Pocket brings a lot of heart to their music; which in my dumb opinion more than few major label artists seem to lack. I can't help but feel a little happier while I'm listening to this cd.The songs, lyrics, vocals are all very original and creative. I'd be hard pressed to pick the best but my personal favorites are Earth Over Air, Drive, Float/Fall, and See Ya Maria. [...]Anyway, I honestly can't think of anything I'd fault or criticise this album on. There's two cds worth of songs here and nearly all of them are good so give them a chance."
5,Dead Presidents: Incredible hip-hop song,"The Dead Presidents 12"" Single was Jay's 2nd single to be released and it helped generate somewhat of a buzz in anticipation of his Reasonable Doubt LP. Let me go ahead and tell you that this is one of my favorite hip-hop songs ever (along with Dead Presidents II). Ski of the group Original Flavor laced Jay with this amazing beat and Jay rips the track to pieces. It samples Lonnie Liston Smith's ""Dreams of Tomorrow"" and also incorporates Nas's voice from ""The World is Yours"" into the hook. If you're lucky enough to find someone selling this single for a reasonable price then I definitely recommend that you buy it. If not, then just buy Reasonable Doubt for Dead Presidents II (with different lyrics). But of course any REAL hip-hop fan would already have that album anyway."
5,I don't really understand the title of this book,"For the finns the first Ten Days of World War II happened from 30.11.1939 when Stalin attacked Finland with 20-30 divisions, in winter 39-40 (The Winter War). It lasted from Noveber 1939 to March 1940.Without reading this book, i can't comment it more. The title however seems to suggest russians still hang on to their soviet time propaganda history."
3,Not much we didn't know before,"This is an entertaining and well-written book, but it really doesn't add anything to what we already know about the topics of (a) how badly prepared the Soviet Union was before the June 22, 1941 Nazi invasion and (b) whether Stalin had really been planning to launch his own attack on Germany at about the same time. One irritation was the fact that the captions on some of the photos (one about a military man dying shortly after his wedding, another of a German fraternising with a Russian family, one female member of whom allegedly later tried to kill him) were not really followed up in the text. So the idea that this book gives new insights into the first 10 days of the war by quoting from personal papers of ordinary Soviet citizens isn't really borne out."
5,Great Book,"Good read, you won't want to put it down. Take the time and purchase more as this is a great autor."
5,L'amour,"I loved this book, it was a great read.If you like westerns you will love this book. L'amour never fails."
5,Louis L'Amour Lovers,"Although this book was a gift, I know that the readers of Louis L'Amour enjoy ""westerns"". While the stories are not always too long, they are easily and quickly read. Especially good if you are trying to get your sons or husbands to read."
2,NEW? NOT!,"As much as I love Scott's work I find it deplorable that Llewellyn would market this as a new book -- Scot has been dead for quite a while, and this is simply one of his older books with a new cover. So, buyer make sure you're getting what you think before you purchase."
2,Dont buy this book if you have 2-3 months experience on PHP,"This book is very basic learning of PHP...strictly only for PHP beginners. But even for beginners this book would surely get out of date. I thought this book would have some PHP object oriented concepts and code snippets, but it was not.So buy this book only if you have absolutely no knowledge of what is PHP and how to run the PHP code."
3,So pour us another vodka...,"This film is best enjoyed after a few shots of KOSKENKORVA and some thick manly sausage. This film is hee-lar-ee-ous if you like Finnish humor. And there's some social commentary there. Notice the abundance of tractors in the opening scene? They are Marxist symbols. Bottom line is, it doesn't work. Good film though. KIPPIS!"
3,Freaky Finns with pointy shoes and 'do's,"A surreal little film about a really bad Finnish polka band come to the US to make its fortune. Picture ten poker-faced Eastern European Blues Brothers clones in pointed pompadours. And their shifty manager and dead bass player. And their sole fan, the village idiot from their tundra hometown. Discovering that polka music doesn't sell in America, the band learns to play rock 'n'roll during a road trip from New York to Mexico. The movie is filmed on location in some of the most blighted bars across the US. It's actually pretty amusing in a dopey deadpan way. Like The Blues Brothers movies, this film has little plot and mostly serves as a showcase for the music. The Leningrad Cowboys are a real Finnish band whose covers of American rock songs (accompanied by the Red Army Chorus)are still popular in Scandinavia and Russia."
3,Did I miss something?,"As another reviewer noted: I also really wanted to like this film but it was hard. I almost only watch foreign films, hoping to learn a little about other cultures. I actually rented this one because I heard some positive reviews of it, but I'd have to say it was medicore at best. I just felt like I was missing something the whole movie, as if I didn't get it. Granted there were cute funny parts here and there, with obvious slants at the Soviets, but it just didn't pull together. My girlfriend (who has been put through many Russian films and enjoyed them) slept through this one. In the end, unless if you're dying to learn about Finnish filmmakers or really expand your foreign film collection, I'd try another film instead."
2,One Word in Finnish: Pettymys,"I wanted to like this film. I liked Kaurismaki's ""The Match Factory Girl"" and loved his ""Ariel."" I love Finland and have been there more times (nine) than to any other European country. I've even been to the Leningrad Cowboy's Zetor bar/restaurant in Helsinki. But this film, about the Leningrad Cowboys trip across the United States, is intended as a comedy, and it just isn't very funny.It also isn't very original. It steals scenes from ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" and ""The Blues Brother Movie."" For example, in the Blues Brother's movie, they stop at a country bar and are booed until they change from blues to ""Stand by Your Man."" In this film, the Leningrad Cowboys stop by a biker bar and are booed until they switch to ""Born to Be Wild.""All in all, a Kaurismaki misfire."
4,"Deadpan, at its best!!!","Great movie! Reviews are going to be real polarized, either you love it or you hate it, there's no middle ground. The dead pan humor just builds with each scene and it just gets funnier. I've seen it 10 times now and each time it just gets better and better."
3,Just o....kayyyyyyyyyy,"I am a huge fan of Coldplay. However, this particular album did not deliver like i thought it would. Their past two albums ""Parachutes"" and ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" were both really good pieces, particularly my favorite is A Rush of Blood to the Head. I was anxiously waiting for X&Y to debut and when i bought this album after listening to it several times i found myself skipping through or barely being moved by this cd. There are only a few songs that actually do something for me and they are Square One, Speed of Sound, and Talk. I am a little disappointed because i guess maybe i expected too much from this album. If you are looking into buying a Coldplay album i recommend A Rush of Blood to the Head or Parachutes, this album however isn't that bad but not all that either."
2,poorly recorded good music,It's so sad that such good music can sound so horrible. Such a waste of talent put on a copy guarded disc. I will never in my life buy another copy guarded disc. Too bad for the artists when their music is so inspirational and they sound like crap.
3,Coldplay: X & Y (Capitol),"Coldplay's objective was to try to create a completely different album than the last one. This one is more focused on being electronic, complex and anthemic. And all while they did well on the opening, the album goes downhill right after the indeed musically complex ""Clocks No. 2"" ""Speed of Sound"". In fact, that is all that is complex about the album so far: the music. This is where we won't see eye-to-eye here. The rest is just kind of bland, and ""Twisted Logic"" takes it all downhill lyrically but does alright musically, until they hit you with the reversed cymbal crashing. The very last song, ""'Til Kingdom Come"" (which channels country and should have really been on their live album as unreleased), plays ressurection. Now, this isn't Coldplay's actual masterpiece (That's A Rush of Blood to the Head.) But you can sure say that they have tried hard enough, only to find it really wasn't worth the sweat at the very beginning.Rating: 5/10"
4,Spirtually Good,"With there multi platinum album ""A Rush of Blood to the Head""with their big single ""Speed of Sound"" which is very catchy with great vocals and lyrics.""Fix You"" and ""White Shadows"" are two personal favorties of mine, with their combination of guitar and high vocals. I also like the songs ""Talk"" and ""What If?"" This album has already been very succesful, hitting #1 and being 3x platinum,I give this album and overall effect of : 4.5/5"
3,Not too shabby,"Like other reviewers have stated, this albumn took some time to ""sink in"". I wasn't too happy with it at first, and I still think 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' is a way better albumn.X&Y; just doesn't have the depth or atmosphere as the previous one did. Although, it is nice to hear some new Coldplay after listening to the two previous albumns over and over. My favorites on this albumn are: Square One, Talk, and White Shadows. The title track is a little corny (waves & outerspace)....yawn. And 'Fix You' is a little sappy. Poor Gweneth!I do appreciate the new material and it has grown on me. However, I don't think they accomplished ""Best band in the world"" status as they claim they wanted to with this offering."
5,This album blows my mind,"I have to be honest, I was not expecting to much out of this new album at first. I love Coldplay's older music, but I just couldn't see how they were going to take there sound beyond there last album. I kind of expected it to sound like there previous album. I couldn't of been more wrong. It still sounds like Coldplay, but they have totally taken there music to the next level. This album is awesome in every way. I would give this album more stars if I could....."
3,What you were looking for - substance,"I judge Coldplay on Rush of Blood to the Head and although, I didn't expect something equally as good, I expected something similar in weight. Obviosly different songs appeal to different people, and the songs on this album are not much less likeable than those on Rush of Blood... but its the overall feel of the album that I have a beef with. Besides 'Talk', evey other song on this album seems like a performance rather than sung from the heart, which Rush of Blood seemed to be doing during its every second. Yes the falsetto is there, it just doesn't display as much emotion as as Rush of Blood and that is my only knock on this album, otherwise, to everyone that knows the band will enjoy it."
4,its not as good as the others,"i just cant get into this one like i could the others. i dont find all the tracks listenable like i did on the other two albums. i dunno... but i get tired of the sound.my fave tracks :: what if (awesome ending), fix you, x&y;, low, hardest part.i feel like those tracks break new ground whereas the others just continue to tread the same old water. im sure ill get a bunch of negative reviews by all the die-hards out there but whatever, thats my opinion (i actually have listened to/own every album before this one)ps the guitar riff on talk is blatantly ripped off/COPIED from kraftwerk's ""computer love"" and it annoys me to no end... just credit the artist already!"
2,Isn't it getting Boring for anyone else yet?,"""Parachutes"" was a very impressive debut. ""Rush of Blood to the Head"" was amazing, one of the best of 2002.But come on, now with this third release, all three records sound the exact same. Martin moaning on the piano, and background music that was ripped off from a bunch of different bands.""Speed of Sound"" is terrible, what an awful song. ""Fix You"" is way better, that's a great tune. The CD has it's moments.I do enjoy Coldplay, their first two albums are played regularly on my CD player. But by the next album, the media that's loving everything they do will say ""Are you guys ever going to change it up?"" Then the fans will follow. They have one or two albums left before they get the backlash. Enjoy it while you can, because I can't see Coldplay changing their sound."
2,What happened here?,"Don't give in to all the hype about this album like I did. I loved the single Speed of Sound, heard great things about the album, and saw it the store for 9.99. I usually preview albums before I buy them but I didn't with this one and that was my mistake. I figured I'd check it out because it was so cheap. I think Coldplay is a good band and had lots of potential for this album but failed to execute. There are a few good highlights like Square One, Speed of Sound, and Talk but the rest of the album has a dull drawn out sound to it. It was a disappointment."
4,Not what I expected,The music over all is good but not the rockin beats I expected. If you want love songs this is the album for you :).
3,Case broken in shipping,"I received the CD within a week, which was good. However, it was shipped in thin plastic with no bubble wrap or other barrier, so the case was badly cracked when I got it. The CD itself was fine. The seller should send their products in a better packaging to prevent damage."
3,"First Exposure, what's all the fuss?","This CD is my first exposure to Coldplay and I am at a loss as to why all the fuss over this band. Then again if you enjoy mainstream, commercial music this is for you.Soon after inserting the disc into my player I removed it to thinking I had selected a U2 disc in error. No error had been made on my part.The same vocals, the same maddening I feel like marching drum beat, the same simpleton bass lines, the same lack of substance on the guitar. Plain and simple, a ripoff of a commercially successful band from the past."
5,COldplay X & Y,"I dont think I really need to write a review, everyone should already own this album. If you haven't, just take care of that."
2,a disappointment!,"I've been a Coldplay fan ever since Parachutes. That's an amazing CD (their best so far) and A Rush of Blood to the Head was good, too (but not nearly as good as Parachutes).I had such high hopes for X & Y, and between my being a fan of the band and the overwhelming hype, it was hard not to be really psyched about this new CD. So, I bought it the day it came out, listened to it, and...was sorely disappointed. Maybe it will grow on me as I listen to it more, but I just really expected more from them."
1,whiny tripe,"I cannot believe how many people like piercing elevator music. Martin is forcing the listener to believe he's depressed, or conflicted about something (maybe how boring and annoying this whole album turned out) and it is not genuine. Writing the equal sign on your hand doesn't make you a champion for the downtrodden, and you are a millionaire with a healthy baby and movie star wife, so the crap you are peddling, I'm not buying. In no way is this rock music, although, maybe adult contemporary soft rock. The song ""Speed of Sound"" is like being trapped in the scent of Ben-gay while your muscles ache from running in the hot sun. Kids, teens, and adults who think this makes them rock fans, it's just too sad.Speed of Sound is terribleFix You is an over-indulgent fake cry fest for what purpose I don't know.This album is not worth your hard earned money. Save some cash, save your ears from shreiking man-children, and buy a Led Zeppelin, Who, or Pearl Jam album. THAT'S rock music."
2,Are you kidding me??????,"I think it's tragic. How can Coldplay, in such a short career, become no better then the rest of radio-gimmick radio bands recycling their biggest hits. C'mon people, there is nothing new on this album, it is completely recycled material. I expected WAY more from these guys. True, I just saw them live on T.V. and Chris Martin thoroughly annoyed me to tears with his horrible stage precense, so maybe I have a little annomosity left over from that. But really, this album is lacking and I think most people that rate this album high probably have a narrow view of music. Sorry, I dont mean to insult you, but do you mean to insult me? It's frustrating how generic music has become. If you want to play it safe, go get Ok Computer or even the Doves disk, or this guy down the street named Tom Foolery can even play for you.... whatever, this sucks."
3,What happened?,"This album sounds nothing like the previous 2. If you're expecting to hear music that sounds similar to ""yellow"",""trouble"",""the scientist"",""in my place"" and so on,this is not the one for you. You can't appreciate Chris Martin's voice on this album because it's not as outstanding as it was in the previous albums.There are a few tracks that are good;Speed of sound,The message,Fix you,Swallowed by the sea(personal favourite)It's not a bad album,but just because this is coldplay,I know it could have been better."
3,"It's not too bad, typical Coldplay","I actually really like Coldplay. The Radiohead comparison will always be there because they sound so much like Radiohead. As for the reviewer that wants defining songs, what are you 13? Van Halen - Jump, KISS - Detroit Rock City, Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit ? and the Mysterians - 96 Tears and many, many, many more (Did I mention Crazy Train? Intro to Clocks doesn't even touch Crazy Train). Coldplay sounds like Radiohead, but they aren't nearly as experimental, and their lyrics make sense for the mainstream radio. Who really cares if they sound like Radiohead? Talk sounds exactly like a U2 song, but who cares. They're a pop band and they write great pop songs. This album is another great example of music engineered for commercial success. And guess what? They got my $18.00!"
5,A Good Album... Very Decent indeed...,"Of course there are somethings that have gone overwhelmingly ridciulous for Cold Play. But their sound is always simple and of course for the masses. It's been interesting listen to their last few albums. But this one is one that I probably like as well as any other (IN FACT I LOVE THIS ALBUM!). It's hard to not notice their songs still madly aired on the radio non-stop nowadays.The same goes for their current single ""Speed of Sound"" is smashing the airwaves across Asia it's my favorite single next to Mariah's ""We Belong Together"" this year. I must congrat them for not loosing their grasp on their music. Unlike most artists who get wealthy but then loose their grasp on their music. They haven't. But they still give out good, decent, friendly and fun listening music which is more than worth your money.Way To Go ColdPlay you proved me wrong again."
4,alright,this cd isnt the greatest but it is good. not all its bragged up to be but still quality music. good buy overall!
4,Great CD (too bad it doesn't work in my car),"The CD is excellent in my opinion. The only problem, which wasn't stated at the time of purchase, is that it will not play on some audio equipment such as car CD players, due to new anti-piracy protection. BUYER BEWARE!I have a 2001 VW Golf and it doesn't play in my CD changer. Ironically, I've already put the CD on my iPod and will probably burn an illegal copy of the CD in order to get it to play in my car. Hopefully that will solve the problem.It's another instance of ill-convceived technology that creates more problems than it solves. I've read of other technology that makes CDs (such as the new Foo Fighters and Dave Matthews Band) incompatible with iPods. see this article on Yahoo! news: (...)To sum it up: Coldplay rocks, record companies don't. Be careful."
2,Mediocre for the Masses,"""Fix You"" is genuinely marvellous, but what happened to the rest of the album? To me, X&Y is a kind of slushy, over-produced, mass market slice of overly sweet cake. Coldplay have mastered the ability to make their music popular to absolutely everyone and in the process watered it down to the extent that it misses the ingredients that could make it truly great. Very disappointing. Download it before buying."
2,Coldplay's worst,"The lyrics, utterly trite, make me embarrassed to be a Coldplay fan. And why o why have they traded in a piano for a cheesy synthesizer?What amazed me about ""Parachutes"" was the sheer restraint of it. It was subtle and nearly perfect from start to finish. ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" was good too; although more direct and louder, gorgeous melodies were still abundant. (The song ""God Put a Smile on Your Face"" was atrocious, and hinted at the lyrical disasters to come).X&Y; sounds different and worse, combining some cheesy drumbeats, synth sounds, and lyrics with deteriorating songwriting. There are a few nice moments here, but I want to sing along again."
1,Is this even music?,"I've never heard such [...] ""music"" in my life. [...] This music [...]! I can't stand listening to one of there songs without getting ready to kill myself. DON'T BUY THIS CD OR ANY OTHER COLDPLAY STUFF! If you realy want good-hearted music, get city of evil by avenged sevenfold. Now that will be money well spent instead of this piece of [...]."
2,I fell to the hype,"This CD is horrendously bland. The second Audioslave CD is way better.This has just been voted ""Best CD of 2005"" by the readers of Q magazine in the UK. Oh dear. What is wrong with people? Rock is supposed to kick and rail against authority, it's not supposed to be something your mom likes or plays in her Volvo when taking your mewling brother to the kindergarten.Music has indeed lost its way if this is the best 2005 has to offer.But of course, it isn't the best. It is not even close to being in the vicinity of being the best.Check out, Porcupine Tree, Roine Stolt or even as I mentioned before, Audioslave for music in 2005 that's at least got heart."
2,Gwyneth Paltrow screwed up the greatest band,"Of course it was just a matter of time for a band to mellow out, but chris fell in love with Gwyneth and had kids what more does he have to accomplish. Remember how it took 6 months longer to finish, because even they knew it sucked. You know what I'm talking about if you bought the live cd and heard the two new songs, this is more of the same. The first six songs are painful, Songs 7,8,9,10, are great coldplay songs, 11,12,13 go back to the suckin'. I've been trying to make myself like them but there is just nothing there. There's always a good chance that Gwyneth exits this picture, if it doesn't happen soon the next cd could be worse. In ten years people will still be listening to the first two cds but not this one. I've seen them twice in concert, I will see them many more times."
1,SHE IS BLIND AND DEATH!!!!,"The girl or boy saying""Coldplay rocks"" is stupid!! X&Y; stinks and Parachutes is much better. Coldplay are not cool. True they do some good songs but how can Coldplay ROCK? I think she was born with a seeing and hearing problem. I think ""A Message"" is the only good song on the album. Every other song, Square One,What If, White Shadows, Fix You, Talk, Ex and Why, Speed Of Sound, Low, The Hardest Part, Swallowed in the sea, and TwistedLogic are all horrid and utterly unlike Coldplay. Plus, I hated what the Q magazine comments said, something like ""Coldplay made it"" or ""Truely magnificent"". Blah Blah Blah Whatever. I don't know what those death reviewers really wrote."
3,Not up to previous standards,"Like others have said, this music needs time to grow on you. Regardless, I don't think that this is quite up to the standards of its predecessors. Coldplay has become a little too sure of themselves. There are many other new albums coming out right now by other bands that I'd much rather spend my 15 bucks on."
2,Coldplay's worst,"Just because you liked the first 2 Coldplay cds don't think you're necessarily going to like this one. I love the first two, but this one leaves me totally flat. Not that it's a departure... it's no departure at all. Maybe their ""thing"" is just getting a little tired. Or maybe this is just an uninspired interval and their ""thing"" will come roaring back on the next cd. (Or -- and don't bet on this, at this point -- maybe next time they'll try something a little new.) I certainly don't insist that a good band reinvent itself with every new release, but these particular tracks are just a big bore, period."
1,not worth it.,"i was a fan of parachutes. a rush of blood to the head was ok. and this cd just didn't quite make it. coldplay's other two cd's were uplifting, but this one is depressing.the thing that i really dont understand is that singer chris martin just got married, has a child, has a wonderful life...then why are his songs depressed? isnt music supposed to be a reflection of your inside?i wouldnt spend more than $3 on this cd."
3,"good, but not great","X&Y is an evolutionary effort, its not by any means revolutionary. For one thing, the band has tried (but not entirely) cast away the ""radiohead lite"" label, they've developed their sound, its not very different, but its distinctively coldplay, for better or worse. So its no Kid A, but for a band in the spotlight they didn't manage to sell out like other bands.. *cough* Dave Matthews *cough*. X&Y might have been a great standalong album but compared to Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the head, it really doesn't stand out that much. In the end, I expected more out of coldplay in terms of lyrics, (some of the songs are a bit painful to listen to because they're just THAT trite). The band has been under alot of pressure to produce this album, and its hard to live up to such high expectations. X&Y is still a decent album, just not great"
5,Review of Cold Play!,I just came on to say this cd rocks! Cold Play is a truly unique and talented band. I love in particular the song Fix You! This cd is a MUST buy for anyones collection!
2,A big regression after the mostly-brilliant Rush...,"Am I the only one that cringes with the Hallmark-like lyrics of this album? The music is derivitive and over-produced. They channeled U2 in a subtle, non-wearing-your-influence-on-your-sleave way. Now they've just gone overboard.This is why artists die when they become happily married. Especially those who base their work on the subject of love. Misery writes the best music.They are on a slippery slope downhill."
5,X&Y could it beat A Rush Of Blood To The Head,Of course Coldplay does it again and beats its last album and makes Coldplay that much better. I really like coldplay there songs are very meaning full and are not just random stuff put together (Example Coldplay threw out tons of songs that they did not like to put on this album). Coldplay is also really dedicated to ther music and fans. They are very careing and they really love to make music. Some of the best songfs on here are:Square OneWhat IfFix YouTalkSpeed of SoundLowSwallowed In The SeaOne of there main hits on this album Speed of Sound was probably so popular because it is very similar to CLocks there smash hit on A Rush of Blood To the Head. Anyway get this it is great and is another perfect ablbum from Coldplay keep up the good work guys.
3,Mediocre Pop...,"I was very excited about the release of X&Y , hoping it'll be a classic like U2's 'Where the Streets Have No Name' or Radiohead's 'Ok Computer' but unfortunately it's doesn't come no where near those albums. The lyrics written on the are the worst of the 3 albums they've released so far. Most of the songs seem stagnant,bland,and very very whiny basically to the point where it becomes irritating. Musically in some songs ('Square One','White Shadow',and maybe 'Fix You') Coldplay's has made some progression from their last album. Hopefully Chris Martin&Co. can make a better album, because they do have the potential. Don't get me wrong this album is decent when compared to the Popular music of today, but when comparing to the first two albums ""Parachutes"" and ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"", ""X&Y"" disappoints."
2,Easily The Worst Coldplay Album So Far,"This album isn't terrible; it's just entirely devoid of GREAT songs. Both Parachutes and Rush of Blood had songs that demanded immediate repeat listens. Not so with X&Y. This album just meanders. The catchy piano hooks that Martin is known for are missing. Very, very disappointed. I think a lot of people really want to like this album, so they're giving it lots of stars. Read the Rolling Stone review for a second opinion. It's dead on."
1,sounds like one long song,straight to the point - boring and unoriginal - every song sounds the same - starts getting annoying by the third song
1,Coldplay rip-off Kraftwerk tune,"Comment below refers to their ""new"" song: Talk.Q: What do you do when you are a band bereft of ideas?A: Don't bother coming up with anything new.Just trall through the tried-and-true section of any sizeable record collection and pilfer something.Then have the ""balls"" to pretend that you have done something other than ""cut and paste"".The radio jocks don't fuss. They say: ""This is great, this is adventurous! (And besides, everyone is doing it.)"".No.Don't we have the original tune (Kraftwerk: Computer Love) still playing somewhere in our thoughts?As for Kraftwek. I guess they are into the franchise business these days. Uber-doober; Money for nothing!A good tune made crummy.Really."
2,weak,cold play is getting gayer and gayer. i'm just waiting for the day whe i light up the télé to hear them in a family sports sedan comercial.
1,All Hype.....No Substance,"This album is as manufactured as it gets. If you listen to A Rush of Blood, then you have petty much heard this record. It is the same recycled trite, with chris crooning away amongst over-production and cliche lyrics. No real talent here, just studio trickery. Makes a good coaster though!"
3,Coldplay has gone melancholy and lost emotion,"With this album, Coldplay has gone sad and melancholy,but not like their other 2 albums. Some of the songs are good, but this album lacks the emotion of the 1st album. The first album was much more energetic. This one is more dry."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"Wow....this band plays the safest, most boring music I've ever heard. 4 chords over and over don't make a song. I find it disgraceful that people feel this album is ""amazing."" As a piano player myself, this album has absolutely no musicianship to it at all. It's processed mainstream pop, and it sucks."
2,"Same formula, over and over....","I don't understand how people are so appreciative of mediocre songs that don't have a catch, and sound exactly alike. Chris sounds the same on every album, the music is the same. These songs could have been in any of their albums. This stuff is HIGHLY COMMERCIAL, riding on the same feeling that made people buy 'Parachutes'. They will never top that record if they keep recycling their music. Meanwhile, they think they're making the next 'Dark Side' or 'Computer'. Just look at the album artwork. These guys are full of themselves. Disgusting."
1,Rubbish,"Woe is me. Woe is Chris Martin. Woe unto all who buy this album...This album will likely mark the beginning of the end of Coldplay's success in Europe. Unfortunately, however, it will only heighten the popularity of the band's following in the U.S. This album is not at all good - it is unimaginative and continually borders on cliches and tired ""already been done (by Coldplay! incidentally)"" themes.I have become resigned to the undeserved success of Dave Mathews, Rob Thomas, John Mayall etc etc, all of whom use a canned approach to ""soft rock."" But Coldplay produced two GREAT albums. X&Y; is rubbish. Don't waste your money."
1,...,"I do NOT understand why people enjoy this band so much... maybe it's not my kind of music? Anyways, I really hate this band because they are way overrated, and their songs are pretty much all the same; I can not stand it. Do not buy this CD, you're better off saving your money."
2,X & Why?--Understanding Coldplay,"People always tell me to listen to Coldplay and claim they're the next big thing. Well, they are certainly popular now, but I can't say that I really enjoy them. Sure, I'm sure they've got talent. But Coldplay just sounds to me as if they're trying too hard to sound like U2. I love U2, but I listen to Coldplay and it sounds a lot like my boys, only without the magic. What's the appeal? By trying too hard to sound like U2, they lose whatever makes U2 enjoyable to listen to in the process, and that's a shame, because I believe Coldplay has a lot of potential."
2,dissapointed....,"a rush of blood to the head is a classic album and easily the best release this decade, imo by any band. that's pretty hard to live up to, apparently even for coldplay. i've sat in my car every drive for the last 2 days really hoping for these songs to grow but i'm getting bored with it. in fact boring is a perfect word for this album. where is the energy and wow factor i was hit with when i first heard a rush of blood or parachutes? hell speed of sound is the best song on here and i dare you to hum it without going into clocks. fair enough to coldplay cause clocks is a great song, but it's little brother shouldn't be the best song on this album. if you like the album than that's great cause i really wish i could. the idea that there's no way you can dislike this album if you like the first two is one of the dumbest statements i've read."
1,dreck,This a truly awful album. I am off now to clean my teeth and throw the window open to try to get rid of the dank atmoshere left by this ghastly overblown pukefest. You may have gathered that I didnt like it much.
2,Ummm...okay....,"Well, I own all the Coldplay albums. I do not know why. I keep trying. I was gonna stop. But I read the great things about this album. So I bought it......and I don't get it. This is so U2...or what U2 might sound like if they were trying to be Coldplay.I've listened to it 6 times. And I've now put it away.Now everyone get mad...."
5,Best Album Ever,"This may possibly be the best album ever recorded. It absolutely blows away the dying U2 and self-absorbed Radiohead schlock that we've had to endure the past few years. Maybe Bono should focus on his music instead of enriching Nigerian despots.Square One: 9/10What If: 10/10White Shadows: 10/10Fix You: 10/10Talk: 10/10X&Y;: 10/10Speed of Sound: 9/10A Message: 8/10Low: 8/10The Hardest Part: 8/10Swallowed in the Sea: 10/10Twisted Logic: 10/10Till Kingdom Come: 10/10The detractors are nothing but a bunch of jealous losers -- save your spite for your miserable little lives. Go back and listen to Parachutes and AROBTTH. Yup, they're not as good. Think of the albums that you can listen to without skipping ONE song.Pearl Jam: VitalogyPeter Gabriel: SoU2: Joshua TreePink Floyd: The WallFleetwood Mac: RumoursAdd the following:Coldplay: X"
1,"X&Y Gets a ""C"" (for c*ap)","We waited three years for this? In my opinion, X&Y is overproduced and extremely uneventful. The edge and emotion is gone, and the few and far between guitar riffs get drowned out (or should I say Swallowed in the Sea) by melancholy synthesizers. This is the sound of the fat-n-happy vs. the up-and-coming. Save your money (if it's not too late) and buy Parachutes and/or Rush of Blood if you don't already have them."
2,X and WHY,"It pains me to write that this album is overhyped, overvalued, and overdone. This will not be the last Coldplay album and this will def never be considered the best Coldplay album. With such a strong debut and powerful second record, it just seemed inevitable that these guys would continue to release gems. They just didnt quite pull it off this time, unfortunately. However, people will continue to buy their music, they will continue to tour, and they will hopefully continue to make music. Hopefully this wont be their best effort from here on in. I would like to hear all the material they supposedly scrapped in the 3 years between Rush and X and Y."
1,Help me!Stop the torture!,"I dont own this album,and never will but whys there so much hype about it?Really Coldplay dont know how to have fun,all they sing about is being depressed and not being optomistic.I heard the samples to see what all the hype was about and I fell asleep,its so slow and boring!Even other slow albums have at least 1 fast and upbeat song!Noone I know owns this album and in my form,noone has it at all (Everyone likes Hip Hop,RnB or Rock)If I saw Coldplay write an upbeat song,I'd eat my PS2!Avoid and dont belive the hype!Get an album by talented artists who write upbeat songs unlike Coldplay like Ludacris!Well done to Crazy Frog for beating Coldplay to number 1!!F**k ColdplayJonesyP.S I think on their album front cover,they made a printing error!they put in pl instead of g so it spells Coldplay instead of Coldgay which is their real name and anyone who likes this has a depressing life!"
3,best buy future No. 1,"Hi i am Alan of Liittle Baddow and you are going to read a great deal about me as I am going to rewiew everthing I watch read and listen to over the next 3 days. some of these products I have even bought (LIKE THIS ALBUM TODAY AT 8.47 AND $0.01)!!! I really like this album of Coldplays - good on you Jimmy Greaves - because it comes with a free credit card and i need one right now -= I am off to visit my cousin in the north island of new zealand so I need a good guidebook (Fodors) and a credit card which has a 20, 0000 limit as my present one is nearly maxed out at 9k. On my salry of 18k (semi retired) I recon the trip will cost 30 % of my salary cheap hey HOPE THE WEATHER IS GOOD THERE AS I BURN EASILY"
2,I had no message and the message was...,"The comparisons some make between Coldplay and U2 are unwarranted. Six years into U2's career, Bono & Co. had already made four LPs with lasting songs like Sunday Bloody Sunday, New Year's Day and Pride (In The Name of Love). Whereas these songs have an immediate and unambiguous message, the only message I can derive from Coldplay is that the world is messed up but let's make the best of it.The music on X&Y; tries too hard to be anthemic, stadium filler. I guess they figured now that they're big, they have to write ""the big song"". Despite this, these songs still sound like easy listening muzak. There is hardly a trace of the charm Coldplay used to have.If you want easy listening, buy some Gordon Lightfoot or Celine Dion.[DW]"
1,Chris Martin has disgraced young Apple,"I loved Parachutes, liked Coldplay's second album, and have nothing but disdain for X & Y. It's simplistic and boring and gets old by the second or third listen. It's waaaaay over-produced, and the lyrics sounds like they were written by a third-grader doing his first poetry assignment. There are a lot of great new albums out there, and some of the hyped ones deserve it (for instance The White Stripes). But this effort by a talented band is truly disappointing."
2,A Huge Let-Down,"Where are those instrumental and melodic hooks that defined this band? The haunting, and beautifully simple guitar parts which struck you on ""A Rush..."" are either gone or are buried in a wall of dreary washes of sound, and the vocals drone and whine away without the resolution or glorious crescendo of the band's outstanding first two albums. Everything sounds labored and overworked. These poor guys must be buckling under the weight and hype of being ""the new U2""...all those expectations. I actually feel sorry for them."
2,Everybody Knows This is Nowhere,"That title is from the old Neil Young/Crazy Horse album, but it pretty much describes the effort here in comparison to Coldplay's first two products. I agree with others that it doesn't amaze or move me. The music is somewhat flat and seemingly uninspired. The lyrics are often weak and haven't got that catchy phrasology of the previous releases. I will continue to listen in hopes to appreciate it more in time. Some releases grow on you the more you listen. Even the Greatest Bands of all time have had bumps in the road. The key is, Can Coldplay overcome this with another stellar performance?"
2,Amazing,". . . that this cheesy, boring, Vegas-lounge effort is given so many superlatives by so many people. I can't find a single song on this album that isn't ruined by embarrassing writing or bland production. This is their ""greatest album yet""? The crisp sound and sharp lyrics are gone and have been replaced with a rock opera by The Carpenters. Coldplay was always a bit overhyped to begin with, but this effort is, as one reviewer put it, ""music for shopping malls and armpit commercials."" To say this cd is disappointing doesn't really come close. It's a collection of numb, lifeless, whiny songs that are posing as angst-art but only manage to bore you to death. There are a hundred bands that can top this in their sleep."
1,My views on Coldplay...,"This is an overrated mess that is loved because it's different from other crap on MTV. Chris Martin has an extremely whiney voice that's so god-damn annoying, it'll make you want to rip your hair out. The guitars are boring. The drums are piles of drab. The bass is inaudible and the pianos although the strongest part of the band are also mediocre at best. This band got a ton of Grammy nominations because they have bad taste in music. Why don't they nominate Opeth, Nevermore, Judas Priest, or Dark Tranquallity for the Grammys? Because they suck and all they love is ColdCRAP!"
2,Look to your left.,"Look to your left, is there a person near by? Chances are, they like Coldplays latest album, or have at least bought it anyway. No, you dont't need to read a review to help you decide whether to purchase this album, you just need to ask yourself ""Do I sing along to advertisements on the TV and radio?"" If the answer is yes, buy this album immediately, then find a herd of lemmings and follow them off a cliff."
2,The loss of brilliance,"When I first listened to AROCBTTH a few years ago I was drawn in to the music further after every listen.With X&Y; I did NOT experience the same magnetism. The songs on X&Y; are, except for a few, not remarkable. The album is rhythmic but not for the most part melodic.After giving up on X&Y; after listening to it 6 times in a row, I listened to AROCBTTH. The sound of Coldplay in 2002 was their moment of brilliance which is now lost."
2,An ingenious band taking their style too far,"Coldplay has always been an extremely favorite band of mine. In my opinion they are eventghe 21st centuries version of the beatles. Parachutes was amzing, as was a rush of blood to the head, but there is nothing amazing about X and Y. I see people giving this album five stars and part of me is thinking that they are giving 5 stars because it is coldplay (imagine giving a beatles album less than 5 stars). The point is the music is stale at most times. There are some good songs, but they all sound the same. The addition of the awful synthesizer is very annoying with that outer space, borderline techo feel. While the album has god songs as said, they are not anywhere near ""yellow"" ""shiver"" or ""The scientist"". There is no hit songs, only a combination of mediocre and above average. I would definitely recommend their other albums in place of this."
1,B&S,"A wayyyy-overrated, merely competent corporate band. Instead of having some bollocks and artistic integrity to find their own sound, they are trying hard to be something between U2 and Radiohead--and failing embarassingly at both. Pretty edgeless, predictable, and limp stuff. They make The Fixx sound like Pantera.If U2 was the Beatles, then Coldplay is The Monkees."
3,Boring...,"Let's start with saying the truth and admit that Coldplay has finally and solidly made it to the mainstream. And very rarely will bands become mainstream by sticking to their essence... one example would be U2. The other quicker way is to become a copycat. And what a coincidence: guess who Coldplay is trying to copy? You're right: U2. Coldplay is trying very hard to sound like U2 in this album. It worked for them, as they've already sold millions of copies of X&Y. But musically, however, the Irish lads will always have the upper hand. In this album, Coldplay sounds monotonous and tired. Their previous release was much better, more authentic to say the least, and it also sold millions. This one just makes me yawn.... a great alternative to those sleeping pills."
4,a great journey,"I think this is an all-around great album. There is something about ""Fix You"" that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Of course, there is also ""Speed of Sound"" and ""The Hardest Part,"" which seemed to be the biggest tracks off this album. The bonus track, ""'Til Kingdom Come"" isn't too shabby either.Anyway, being one with a discerning ear and a home theater setup that can expose flaws in recordings, I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge that this album is a victim of the loudness war and contains almost no dynamic range. There are long passages of songs that border on clipping and are just plain LOUD. Of course, I've come to expect this from all new recordings, so I won't dock the album that much."
3,"Man, I really wanted to like it","I bought this CD because of ""Speed of Sound"" which I've been playing non-stop for a couple weeks now - BUT, the rest of the CD just isn't as catchy. Some decent songs, but not as moving as ""Rush of Blood"". Strangely, it has an early U2 sound to it.Maybe I'll like it better with more listening, but right now it gets just a 3, maybe 3 1/2."
5,Awesome,Fabulous Music... Listen to the Words!!! Very creatively put together. Love it! The cd right before this one is also fantastic.
1,Why can't they mix without OVER-COMMPRESSION?,"What the heck is the matter with the deaf people who mix Coldplay? Being an audiophile, I like to be able to hear a clear, clean mix where you can hear all the instruments without distortion. Coldplay's music is great, but you can't hear the delicate intricasise. The comperssion just doesn't stop. I can't stand to listen to it at anywhere near the levels of other bands of the same type.You look up the people who are doing the mixes on the internet, and they are all are talked about in the glowing terms as to there credentials and expireance. Well, I would give anything if they'ed get off the compressors and give me a clean recording that I could actually listen to. I cannot express strongly enough how terrible I think Coldplay music sounds. Yuk!"
5,"Simply fabulous, again!","I cannot stop listening to this CD, Coldplay has done it again...it's amazing. The lyrics, the composition, the emotion of this CD is simply fabulous...I have recommended this to all of my family and friends."
3,Not Great... Not Bad,"If this were the first album by an unknown band we would consider it a great first effort and hope for better in the future. As it stands Coldplay has released two great albums and this one is a let down. I'm not saying it is terrible, it is good, but it deffinitely is not great. I gave it a long time to grow on me and have come to the realiziation that it just doesn't stand up to the quality of their first two album and even some of the B-sides for that matter.10 years from now this wont be considered their best album and despite all the hype it isn't their best album today. Infatuation doesn't make something great."
5,"Great, Great, Great, Great","Seriously, this was the only album i was listening to last week. Driving to work, at work, on the way home from work...minimum 3 times a day. The first 8 tracks are just pleasure to my eardrums. ""White Shadows"" is probably my favorite of those, but it's hard to pick and choose, they're all so fantastic. And ""Kingdom Come"" is a happy additional, another wonderful song that was originally written for Johnny Cash. Get this record now if you don't have it already."
2,Poor follow up,"I must be missing something or else people are a bit too biased. I was really looking forward to this CD after their last one and their recent single Speed of Sound, but I have listened to it 4 times in my car and am not impressed at all. Other than the single, there are no songs that are intersting enough to want to hear over and over or (like A Rush of Blood) that bring out the emotion of it's predecessor."
5,Outstanding stuff,"Even though this album didn't grow on me as quickly as Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head did, after repeated listens I think it is the best album of the three Coldplay has released because of its consistency. Every track on X&Y is solid and if you like Coldplay in the slightest you should definitely pick this album up."
5,Coldplay's dreamy beautiful style remains,"X&Y is like Rush Of Blood To The Head but just a lot better. Their songs still retain their mystical spacy dreamscape kind of sound, which all Coldplay fans love. A must buy."
5,Works great as an enema,"This long awaited CD X&Y is a cure for my gastric distress. When I first hit ""play,"" the intestinal fluids began to flow in the most soothing natural way. I especially like the song about meeting a polar bear and sheep and making them all die of boredom. Chris Martin is a lyrical genius and let's make him our polar bear soverign of white icy meleancholy. As my intestines began their regenerative glory, this album whished the bile to and fro, the perfect inspiration for my bowels. This is some of the very best enema music I have yet heard. I am a 78 year old grandmother but I think Chris Martin is hot. He came over last night and let me tell you he is such a gentleman in the bedroom. Thanks Chris from all the grannies who love the foulest of corporate rock."
2,"This Album is Good, If You're Deaf","God-Four babies banging on Pots is better than this crap. Take my advice, go buy ""THE BIZ"" by The Sea & Cake"
5,Very Good!!!,"This CD manages to do what a lot of others can't, it ignites the imagination with all sorts of colors and hues. ""X&Y"" starts out with the powerful and triumphant ""Square One."" From then on, you will absolutely remain breathless. In fact, I think they saved one of the best songs for almost last, ""Twisted Logic."" The middle is stuffed with so much good stuff that it's very filling now matter how you stack it. This has to be one of the best albums released in a long time. I've bought many, but this one stands out in a very crowded and diluted field."
4,Almost as good as the new Oasis album,"X&Y is very good, yet a disappointment compared to Coldplays earlier music. Speed of Sound is really the only decent track. If you like Coldplay (good Coldplay) you are sure to enjoy the new album from Oasis, Don't Believe the Truth. I can't get Keep the Dream Alive out of my head. Hope some of you enjoy this new Colplay cd. Otherwise, pick up the new Oasis cd. It's the number one cd worldwide right now. Cheers."
2,The Biggest Disappointment of 2005,"The person who wrote the review below me is completely wrong. Coldplay's records always sound excellent on a first listen. It's when you listen to them more to enjoy the intricacies that they fail on so many levels. Predictable song structures, meaningless lyrics, and cheap, cheap U2 and Radiohead rip-off's everywhere. Chris Martin said they were going to be the next U2, but U2 won album of the year and this wasn't even nominated. So for once the Grammy's got it right."
2,just ok,"There are a few good songs. Otherwise its melancholy background music to fall asleep to. God, FIX YOU has to have the most irritating contrived manipulative lyrics in a song. ""Tears stream down your face, when you lose something you cannot replace."" haha. laughable. ""lights will guide you home, & ignite your bones."" ""i will fix you."" c'mon, this is why coldplay is so popular, peddling this crap to the masses."
2,Coldplay's X and Y= ZZZZ,"I am not the world's biggest Coldplay fan, but I very much enjoy there brit pop album. This and the new White Stripes album both came out on June 7. I looked forward to both. Both were dissapointing. But ""X and Y"" is worse. Songs such as "" Fix You"" and ""What If"" have absurd lyrics and lack the energy of Coldplay's previous albums. ""Twisted Logic"" tries to hard for the emo angle, when in fact, it just doesn't work. The only songs that are good on the album are Speed of Sound and A Message. Don't buy the album. Go on Itunes and buy those two tracks, cuz overall, X and Y is a mixture of material with potential that, together, just doesn't work."
2,Same As It Ever WasSame As It Ever WasSame As It Ever Was,"Ahhhh, a world has waited for a new voice, for a band to keep every one from running to U2 and to bury the memory of Radiohead. X&Y is as easy as 1,2,3- This was supposed to be Coldplay's ""Rock"" album... The opening single is catchy and well over produced and sounds like a hidden track that should be found on ""How to Dismatle an Atomic Bomb"". I hoped for a bit too much. I think it is simple... Coldplay follows in music... They are a talented Pearl Jam living in the shadow of their own Nirvana... Radiohead."
1,Pathetic Bono and Thom York poser's most trite work,"The pathetic lead singer of this group causes me to give this horrid review. He is nothing but a pale imitator of the pop style of Bono from U2 and the vocal technique of Thom Yorke from Radiohead. People compare his vocals of to the stratospheric Jeff Buckley but he is merely a sissy Thom Yorke impostor. The first album at least had credible power guitar hooks on tracks like ""Yellow"" and ""Shiver"" that at least gave these commercial mass market music perveyors masquerading as artists the facade of being a rock band. ""Speed of Sound"" is simply a reworked version of their previous single ""Clocks"". The only bearable song of this guy is ""In my Place"" but Thom Yorke has more intensity in one of the flaxen hairs of his scrotum than this flaccid banal pop star has in his whole body."
3,I'm A Bit Disappointed,"I really was anticipating this album. I'm not sure what went wrong, but this is not the album people want to hear. It has the same formula, but the lyrics sound generic at times. It does feel good to hear some new Coldplay though.The opening, ""Square One"", is a good track, but things go downhill until ""Fix You"". (I like this track a lot.) ""Talk"" is good listening. Why does anyone listen to ""Speed of Sound"". That is what record companies want when ""Clocks"" does so well. ""A Message"" is a great song. Can't wait to hear it in concert. And the bonus joint is the type of venture I was looking for. I wish 'play would have stuck with Ken Nelson as the producer of the album -- not just three cuts."
1,This band sucks,Im gonna leave this short and simple this band is the worst band ive ever heard in my life do urself a favor and dont give these guys any more money for their crappy music
3,Could have been better,"For Coldplay, the third time is definately not the charm with the release of their new album XY. The album moves along at a snails pace, and reminds me of REM's last effort, Around the Sun, because of the pacing, and the fact that their really aren't any memorable songs here. If you want to invest your money in an album that shows remarkable range and is a joy to listen to, give BEFORE THE ROBOTS by BETTER THAN EZRA a try."
3,Mediocre,It just doesn't capture the power of the previous albums. Check it out though.Also check out the innocent Michael Jackson.
2,Eventually Every Band Lays an Egg...,"so who's ready for an omelette. This just doesn't even come close to the previous albums. The whole album is about Chris Martin's voice, much like every new U2 album is about Bono's voice. I got the sense from the X tracks that they're trying to take their music in a slightly different direction, while most of the Y tracks resonated more strongly with the previous albums. I'm all for bands going in new directions; I'm just not sure this one is headed in the right direction, musically. Puts me a bit in mind of Pink Floyd, actually. When the albums just became about Roger Waters (e.g. The Final Cut), that was the end."
2,Boring,"""Parachute""s and ""A rush .."" were better than this album. It sounds like they recycled some of their old songs and made it more slow paced.All the songs are boring. I almost fell asleep listening to this album many times.A BIG YAWN"
4,Mike Says : Another great One,Coldplay has done it again with this CD. Each song has a unique sound and potential hit quality. If you liked the last you will love this one.
5,Coldplay prove they're no one-hit wonder,"Many doubted that Coldplay could match the success of Grammy-winning 'Clocks', but with X&Y they have raised the stakes. Just about every song is single material, an accomplishment that has spawned criticism that the band has ""sold out"" with ""music for the masses."" I'm still wondering how making music that so many people of all ages and nationalities enjoy listening to is a bad thing."
3,Safe Bet,"Coldplay has achieved great recognition prior to the release of their third album X&Y. They did this by creating a sound so unique while at the same time appealing to mass audiences. I have no arguements that this album is a great album, but their unique sound seems to be made up of other influences. In some ways Coldplay represents a watered-down version of Radiohead, this was apparent in the first two albums but not the the extreme in this third album, X&Y. When you listen to this album it will seem as though you have heard this album many times before, making it almost predictable. Even their first single off this album, Speed of Sound, resembles one previous hit, Clocks, greatly. Although this album is a good album, thats all it is, a good album."
4,the enjoyable tracks are the ones that sound like U2,"there, i said it. not a bad disc. not a great one either. buy it, or buy a U2 disc. either way you're guaranteed a handful of good songs."
4,Good listen,This cd was good. I didn't like it as much as Parachutes. But it is still a good listen.
4,Coldplay finally got it right,"The impression I get is that the two previous albums were nothing but a preparation for this one, which is undoubtedly their best work so far. From the catchy 'Talk' (ok, they got the main riff from Kraftwerk's Computer Love, but that doesn't make the song any worse, does it?) to the beautiful folk-rock ballad 'Til Kingdom Come'. Just hear carefully how the drums and dynamics of the songs have evolved. Listen to 'Clocks' and then to 'Speed Of Sound' for comparison matters. The only reason I won't give 5 stars to this album is because I really think lyrics should be more than just simple rhyme."
3,Colday is no RADIOHEAD..,"Ok... I like this album, but then again, I'm waiting for Coldplay to progress towards something new; a different sound. I am a big fan of Rush of Blood to the Head - that album is out and out beautiful in the way that it reaches both emotional highs and lows, and the self-titled ""ROBTTH"" and ""Amsterdam"" cap of the album leaving me wanting to replay the album again..However, I don't have that same feeling for X & Y. Part of me thinks that because most everyone is giving this album 5 stars is because they've never heard any other Colday.. and that's a shame, sorta.I totally believe that Coldplay achieved much much more with Parachutes and Rush of Blood.. I give this album more like a 3.25, maybe 3.5...And if anyone would like to argue that Coldplay is Europe's greatest band of this age, YOU, friend, ARE WRONG. You're forgetting/ or never even delved into the greatness that is RADIOHEAD. Here's 2 must-have albums - OK Computer, and Kid A !"
5,LOve the CD!,"I love the CD! Coldplay's melodies are intoxicating, and Chris MArtin's vocals are very nice. Speed of Sound, COldplay, X & Y, Coldplay, UNdertow, Corinna Fugate, all very good music."
2,Bland,"I was a little disappointed by this album. All the hype surrounding its release literally forced me into buying it and the little snippets I heard on itunes sounded enticing.I found the melodies and arrangements a little formulaic and repetitive. I think their sound is becoming a little too predictable and not very exciting.This is mainstream, uninspiring pop music, disguised and packaged as cool music by a leading rock band.I think recent works by bands like Wilco and Radiohead and artists like Rufus Wainwright are far superior!"
4,Some excellent songs,"I recently saw an independent movie called Young At Heart. One of the songs in that movie really touched me, and, of course, it was written by Coldplay. I'm a real fan of this group and have been for quite some time. The album was an older one that I didn't have, but I have enjoyed many of the songs."
5,Stick With X and Y,"No need to look any further for the BEST album of 2005. It has officially arrived courtesy of Coldplay. I have been playing this CD for a week and it just improves with each spin. You just don't know how good X&Y; really is until you play something else. After listening to a new CD that I had purchased, I had no choice but to draw the conclusion that X&Y; is the masterpiece that others are claiming it is. Every song leaves you in awe. It's amazing that so many great songs could end up on one album. So stick with X&Y.; You won't be disappointed.FAVORITES: White Shadows, What If, Twisted Logic"
5,What is there to say?,"Coldplay are pros at making music, it's as simple as that. I think it's clear by now that this album is about as good as it gets in modern music.Anyone who disagrees must be lacking ears."
4,very close to excellence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When i first listened to this album, i have to admit, that i was a bit disappointed.But then i listened to it more carefully and i realised how good it was!I got stuck with the follwing songs(they are randomly written):1)speed of sound 2)fix u 3)talk 4)low 5)a message 6)the hardest part.I really love these songs and obviously they are my most favourite in ths album!To be honest, i don't think this is their best album because i consider ""a rush of blood to the head"" as their BLOCKBUSTER!!!!!!!!This is because i like almost every song in this album.HOWEVER,this one is also v. good,i listen to it thousands of times everyday!!In addition,i rally enjoyed them at the LIVE 8!They are vry good at their lives,ain't they?I LOVE THEM!!"
4,Let this album speak for itself,"This happens to be the next generation's GREATEST band. Coldplay has finally lived up to its status. Their music is comfort-food to their listeners. After 2002's ""Clocks"", a smash-hit from their sophomore release,""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" Chris Martin's lyrics and piano is well-connected to his other bandmates as they perform together to make it more enjoyable to listen. Their first single, ""Speed of Sound"" is now a well-established #1 hit. the next single from ""X&Y"" will probably be ""Fix You"" with some help from the surviving Gibb Brothers, Barry & Robin, AKA The Bee Gees. Other great songs worth listening to: ""White Shadows"", ""Low"", and ""Square One"". Add this to your CD Library, It's worth it. You won't be disappointed."
2,Not their best,"""Speed of Sound"" is a very good song, and ""Fix You"" is sublime. Other than that, this album doesn't have much going for it. (Get ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" instead---that was a great album.)"
5,Passing the torch,"This entire album is the essence of individual growth and of equally individual sense of time passing. Every single tune, regardless of lyrics-inspiration or tune-borrowing, is a powerful reminder to all twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, or forty-somethings, that there is a little bit of us that needs to be brought forth to the ones that will carry our torch on. This is the one album for us to remember and for our next generation to learn from."
5,Flying At The Speed Of Sound,"X&Y is the best album that I've come across as far as I can remember. If I wasn't already a raving mad Coldplay fan, this album would have made me one. From the euphoric Franz-Ferdinand-meets-Travis frenzy of ""White Shadows"" to the acoustic sweetness of the hidden bonus track ""Kingdom Come"" recalling John Denver's ""Annie's Song"", every track on the album takes you through on a journey through soundscapes filled with rich musical details. From the deliberate fragility of Aqualung to the laid-back drifting of Rialto, the third album pushes the boundaries of the Coldplay sound to encompass a wide variety of influences, presenting a repertoire that is part rock, part ambience, and all Coldplay. It is gorgeous, it is marvellous, it is terrifying. Humanity in general needs more albums like X&Y--there would be less suffering, and more joy."
5,A serious artistic statement,"Remember these words: This album will be remembered as the most important, historic and impressive of the year. X & Y is the best song I've ever heard since Radiohead's Sit Down Stand Up. Everytime I hear both songs I get chills throughout my body for about 15 minutes. AMAZING.IMO this album is the finest moment of any British band since Ok Computer. Its a masterpiece, unparalleled soul-spilling, the soundtrack of a life. Cheers."
3,As inventive as an Apple Martin(i),"the title of coldplay's new album ""X&Y"" unknowingly presents itself for evaluation in linear form. let's assume that ""x"" represents each track number and ""y"" represents the quality of each track (out of 10), so that a graph would illustrate an overall rating of the album. after listening, the equation is therefore y = mx + b where m = 0 and b = 7.5. what does this mean? it means there is no slope (i.e. no variance) to this line. it means that there a constant of semi-decent music moving at an unflinching pace (75%), but with uber-simplistic and entirely safe lyrics written most likely by the winner of a local third grade poetry contest. it means that EVERY COLDPLAY SONG ON THIS ALBUM SOUNDS THE SAME, IS GENERIC, AND EARNS A FAT ""C"" IN MY BOOK."
1,no good,"I already wasted enough of my time listening to this romper room music, and I can't be bothered to expend my energy into writing a review, but I will give a quick synopsis. No Good."
1,"Why does this exist? It shouldn't, but sadly it does.","Is it just me or does it feel like they let Nickelback write most of the songs on this album? I mean it's either that or they just want their CD's to rot for eternity in the adult contemporary section of your local dollar store. Not to mention the vocalist,""no I will not refer to him as a singer"", sounds like a dying brain damaged horse. Well it certainly doesn't help.I feel bad giving them one star because I don't want them to feel like I got anything out of their ""music"", because frankly that would be lying.Oh and for anyone who doesn't want to read my entire opinion and wants a summary in layman's terms. This CD sucks."
1,Why do I give one star,"General idea:A bad lead singer does not mean the band is bad. No matter whining, screaming, murmuring. We have a lot of great bands doing that.A bad guitarist or bassist or drummer or whoever does not mean the band is bad. There are many players who cannot play better than average playing in many great bands.Then what will it be to guarantee a bad band? Bad music.Coldplay is the most famous bad music maker on earth today. However, their music may be more ""decent"" than that Linkin Park or Good Charlotte make. But it is worse. Everybody knows that Linkin Park is even retard for a rap metal band. Coldplay is famous because a lot of people including those who consider them with good taste(i.e., not a highschool kid's taste) like this band. What I want to say is, picking out any 90s brit-pop band with at least 2 albums you know, it will be much more talented and creative than Coldplay."
2,This album is a comet,"A particular sentence in my college astronomy textbook caught my eye the other day:""A comet is as close as something comes to being nothing.""A statement that could very well have been written to describe Coldplay's newest effort."
4,Coldplay's Finest Overall,"When I first purchased X&Y;, I was thrilled, since you know, it's Coldplay, and it's been a few years since their last album. At first, I wasn't all impressed with it, but as many know, it takes a short while until the songs really have any effect. . .at least for me.So it goes, the more I listened, the more I enjoyed, and the more I admired the lyrics. Unlike the first two albums, whereas I admired most of the songs, there were usually only 2-3 songs that really stuck to me. I think overall, this is Colplay's finest album. My top 2 would have to be Speed of Sound and A Message. But I'm still debating, because I really like Square One and Talk, too.This album has certainly satisfied this fan of Coldplay, and it only makes me more anxious to wait for their next live concert, which isn't too far away. Definitely worth your ears listening to."
3,An Honest Review,"When I heard the new song Speed Of Sound, I wanted to buy it. I am fourteen, and I have been playing piano for six years, so I automaticly liked coldplay when they came out with their first CD. But this CD (which to me, is a step down from parachuttes and A Rush Of Blood To The Head) seems too plain, and maybe it's because of the overly retro booklet. But there are some good songs like: Speed Of Sound, Fix You, and A Message. It is worth buying if you can find it for ten dollars. But to me, A Rush Of Blood To The Head is their best CD which has my favorite Coldplay song: The Scientist."
5,Well worth the three year wait!!!!!,"I became a huge fan of ColdPlay when I heard the song Trouble on there first album Parachutes. I diffently could not wait for there third album X&Y and it was worth the wait. Every song on here is so good and to me there musical talent's just keep getting better every cd. There such an amazing band!!! Every song on here is good, there isnt one that I don't like. Chris just has an amazing voice and he sing's the songs so well. Keep it up ColdPlay!!!!!"
5,A masterpiece...,"I used to hate this band, but when a friend give me this album, I change immediately my opinion. This is great album. All songs have a different particularity. When Coldplay become a great band..."
4,Waiting for it to grow on me...,"I bought ""X&Y;"" around the same time I bought the Killers' album, and I find myself listening to The Killers much more often. I loved ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"", but it took a few listens for all of the tracks to grow on me. Now ARoBttH is easily my favorite CD of all time. I'm hoping that repeated listenings will improve X&Y;, but truthfully I end up falling asleep to most the tracks. So far, my favorite songs are ""What If,"" ""White Shadows,"" ""Speed of Sound,"" and the bonus track. The CD is really well-done - it's just so sleepy, from beginning to end! Some of the songs are just plain annoying.I gave the CD 4 stars because I'm assuming it will grow on me as I listen again and again, and the songs begin to distinguish themselves from each other."
5,Best album of the year,"Like all Coldplay albums, after you listen to them a couple times, It won't leave your cd player for months, and thats exactly what happend with X&Y.;Highlights:Talk (A song I have been obsessed with)Fix youWhat ifA messageSwallowed in the SeaSpeed of Sound"
2,Kind Of Boring - Just Not My Thing,"I enjoy rock and roll and I found this album and band to be quite boring. I know I will probably be insulted and such just for my opinion, but I just wanted to write a review that people who enjoy my same interests in music could understand what would be a good buy. It seems like this CD could be elevator music or relaxing, meditation tunes, but not something you could move or connect to. I have nothing against the band or the people that listen to their music, I'm just wrting an honest review. Thank You..."
3,A Mediocre Effort,"Compared to their last album, X&Y is actually rather lame. The music isn't as adventurous and the the lyrics seem to be trying too hard. I was a very big fan of Rush of Blood.. but this album sounds like a mediocre band trying to sound like the Coldplay of 2003. There will be die-hard fans out there that will defend this to the end but they are too close to be subjective. If you are not a huge Coldplay fan, I would recommend maybe buying only a couple songs from ITunes instead of wasting it on the whole album."
1,DONT BUY THIS CD IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY,"this cd isn't that good i don't know wheather it's because i don't like coldplay or it's because they sound like dave matthew's band (F.Y.I.)(i hate dave matthews band)""Coldplay you should have stayed with your song from your last album clocks"
1,Bad Lyrics and U2 Rip Offs Abound,"I was cringing at the empty headed lyrics on this CD. Chris Martin obvioulsy has too much on his hands to spend some time on his end of the job, it's understandable - but just the same.Coldplay do ballads, and they do U2 songs. The pumping bass and drums, delayed guitars and melodies that sound too familiar. I suspect these guys cringe everytime they might have to bump into U2 socially ""Hi, thanks Bono - the check's in the mail, mate."""
2,Boring and Slow,"Granted I just got the CD and maybe it will grow on me. First impression, the CD is boring. I will update my review if the CD grows on me, but reading some of the other reviews it doesn't seem likely.OK, I've listened to the CD about 3 times .... IT'S HORRIBLE! Too bad because I really liked Parachutes and Rush of Blood to the Head. I would have given it 1 star however there are 2 redeeming songs: ""Speed of Sound"" and ""Till Kingdom Come""."
1,Coldplay sux,"You know I'm not going to listen to your nonsense, and anyway, IDON'T need help. Coldplay doesn't rock. How can you call peoplewho come on stage looking gungy and horrid a band who ROCK?!?!Coldplay are the worst band in the world, and X&Y; is their third and WORST album, not their third and best album."
3,solid but not essential,"did anyone else notice that the riff in ""talk"" is a blatant rip-off of kraftwerk's ""computer love?"""
5,Take the Time to Listen to this Album,"I sat down the other day to listen to this album straight through. I wasn't a Coldplay fan...I like Classic Rock and maybe some Red Hot Chili Peppers (sometimes). But this album is fantastic. Please don't pay attention to what some of the other reviewers on this site are saying about the album. In my opinion, I think people were expecting a Coldplay ablum like Parachutes and Rush of Blood...so they probably think the CD sucks just because it doens't sound like the others. But I say why should the band continue to play the same style over and over again. It's obvious Coldplay is trying to re-invent themseleves here, and for me it definitely worked. I was thoroughly moved by listening to the album even though I hardly listen to Coldplay or respected their music before a few days ago. If the album had sucked I probably would have blamed it on Gwenyth, but I feel like Coldplay has MASTERED the studio album with this latest release. It's perfect."
2,Too much of the same-need a little risk taking,"Bands don't need to be different for the sake of being different, but I prefer when each CD a band creates is a separate entity from the ones that have come before them. X&Y is basically a clone of RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD but lacking the few essential differences that would make this something other than a tired retread. The same sound, the ethereal production, but now it's wearing thin because you sit there and say ""Haven't we heard this before?"" I don't really dislike the sound, but X&Y is just pleasant background noise. Here's hoping the next time out the band puts a little edge on their music."
3,No Rush,"Although nowhere near as good as the previous albums or b-sides, X&Y; is getting serious airtime during my morning commute. Let me state here that I really dig the Coldplay sound and will listen to just about anything they release. However, it took several plays to get into this album and, as stated in many other reviews, it is lacking the track or two that simply rock. You won't find a ""Clocks"" or ""Yellow"" on this album. I'm going to go middle of the road with the star count. Wasn't thrilled but wasn't as disappointed as with some of the other ""highly anticipated"" releases of this year.Bottom line: If you really dig Coldplay, you'll enjoy the album. If you can take or leave them, you're better off passing."
1,Rip-off,"Coldplay sucks. That out of the way, the singer is a dweeb and he is so full of himself it's sickening. He rivals Billy ""Pumpkinhead"" Corgan when it comes to the dork factor. I read about them being ""influenced"" by Kraftwerk on the track ""Talk"". Influenced? When a song's main melody is used outright, like it is here, it is not being ""influenced"" by; it is ""ripping off"". How can a band that produces such unoriginal crud be so popular? I think it has a lot to do with hype. They're supposed to be the next big thing. Big deal. Who cares. And if this band is so hot, why can't they buy some decent clothes? I can't stand bands that have no sense of style or pride in their stage appearance. But the bottom line is the music sucks. Buy something else."
2,Boring play,"The first single's music video is pretty good, but the music are way too boring. I can't see any different between their 1 2 3 albums. Why there's no heavy band in the UK?"
1,"I'd pass, but if you have a little sis","While I'm not a fan, I gave this album one star because my little sister likes it. She's nine yrs. old and she also likes the music by Ashlee Simpson and Lindsey Lohan. Since Coldplay's lyrics are written from the perspective from a 12 year old, they're just her speed."
3,Review of Coldplay CD Order,"It could have come in a more timely fashion, and the CD case was cracked! I was very disappointed."
2,It's really whiney,"I am a Coldplay fan, but most of the arrangements on this album are very similar & even similarly whiney. I was sorely disappointed!"
5,#11 Swallowed In The Sea - Remarkable,"Admittedly, I have not listened to all of the songs on X&Y; more than once. The reason - the first time I listened to it, I could not get past #11 Swallowed in the Sea. Chris' vocals are unbelievable and the melody is great. It's also one of those songs that gets better with each listen. I think it will join the likes of ""Hey Jude"" and ""Let it Be"" as one of the greatest songs of all time.I give the CD 5 stars on Track 11 alone."
2,The Newest U2 Album Delivers,"This is an excellent new effort by U2. Bono's vocals are just as good as they ever were, The Edge is creating some masterful sounds, and it all adds up to another great album. Definately a must buy if you're a true fan of U2.Seriously, what the hell is Coldplay trying to sound like? Sometimes it's Radiohead, then they have this wierd Enya thing goin' on, and this album has U2 written all over it.I expected more from Coldplay. They can do better."
5,X & Y is I & N & C & R & E & D & I & B & L & E!!!,"I luv Coldplay!!!! They are so good to listen to!!!!!!!!!!!!I luv ""Square One""! It's really nice!! :-)Also, I like ""Till Kingdom Come""!! It's the hidden track which is actually pretty easy to find. Just go to track 13! I like it cuz I was gonna off myself--cuz life is dank and empty :-(And I was all ready to do it (I had a friend who was gonna drop a way cool computer on me from 20 floors above) but I heard ""Till"" on my iPod and I waved up at him to not drop the thing!I also really like ""Talk""! The melody is sooo good!! :-P"
3,not what i expected,"The new Coldplay album is somewhat of a disapointment just because its to ''produced'' for my taste.It does sound like u2 even if Chis Martin is contradicting that in every interview.I was hoping for a mix between the first to albums but x&y is far from that,there's actually not one song that reminds me of the ''real'' coldplay.Speed of sound is okay and thats all the good i can think about right now..."
2,Pu@^y Rock,"What is the deal? These guys do not rock. This album isn't cool. I was forced to listen to it on a car trip and I was not impressed. There is not one catchy song. Nothing really rocks. The lyrics are faux deep and uninspiring. Chris martin is a tool. He should do some drugs or something. I'm sick of his supposed ""fairy-tale"" romance to Gwyneth Paltrow (she looks kind of ratty these days anyway). I hate when we have to see some self-satisfied gazillionaire sigh complacently about how she has found true love with some sensitive man whatever just stop it. I hope he gets caught with his pants down with some 19 year-old groupie in a coke orgy. Plus, Chris, knock it off with the fair-trade nonsense. If you really believed in that tripe you should follow through with it in your own life. In that case you should have been paid like $500 total for making this flat can of Shasta of an album. Coldplay sucks."
2,Cold play,I'm not wasting my time writing a negative review. All I'll say to you people passing out 4 and 5 stars like mints is this: Snap out of it. These guys are done unless they do a one-eighty.
1,DRM prevents copy to ipod,"The music might be OK, but everybody should noticethat Coldplay makes it impossible to move the musiconto an mp3 player. You are probably smart enoughto get around the DRM crap on the disk - but whydo you want to support a band that thinks you shouldnot be allowed to listen on your mp3 player after*buying* the gorram cd??!"
4,Pretty Ok for a long long drive,some stand out tracks. it's actually a pretty good album if you can bring yourself to sit and really really listen to the words and the melody. i pop it in sometimes when i need to think.
4,Greatest band in the wolrd!!!,"Chris Martin has become the new ""Bono, Michael Stipe and Paul McCartney"" of his generation. The lyrics, the voice, the sound; they come alive together!!! Once again Coldplay does not disappoint. Songs like ""Square one, Low, Fix you and Speed of Sound"" are instant classics! May this band continue to make great music for decades to come! P.s, Coldplay was great at ""Live 8 2005."""
4,What's wrong with the more of the same?,"Is there a word to describe this album or any other by Coldplay. I think there might be one. Moving. This album is a reflection of alot of hard work. The work shows and it pays off. I try to be somewhat objective. I don't want to compare this album to A Rush Of Blood To The Head. It would be impossible to accomplish what they did there. But this is a great follow-up. There is alot of heart here. The sound is not groundbreaking but who wants Coldplay to sound like anything but Coldplay? I am a huge fan and this album is everything I wanted it to be. Highlights include Fix You, Till Kingdom Come and What If. The album starts off ""vintage"" Coldplay. And ends on the highest note. I don't give this album five stars because I would like to hear a bit more guitar on this album. But all and all I love Coldplay and I love this album."
1,"Overrated, and one of the worst albums of the year","I'll start off by saying that I enjoy a fair amount of Coldplay's music.X&Y;, however, I could not get into. It lacks innovation, imagination, and variation. All of the songs are the same melodically. They all start slowly and build into a crescendo, but one that dissapoints every time. If you're looking for similar music, try Rufus Wainwright. He has a very unique voice, but unlike Coldplay has some true vocal talent, and his music starts slow and builds, finishing well. Coldplay, it seems, has tried their hand at this--having already saturated their work with acoustic ballads and piano-driven songs, it seems as if they are doing something new in the hope that it might catch on. They were lucky, because most Coldplay fans ate this album up without really thinking about how atrocious it is. Truth is, Coldplay failed miserably."
3,Pretty disappointing!,"When I bought this album I didn't have great expectations... I tend to listen to critics from a source in Denmark and they usually always share my oppinions on music. (Also on this album)There are a couple of outstanding tracks like ""What If"" and ""Low"" but the rest all sound like each other or something Coldplay has written on previous albums - that's not very creative.All in all it's a pretty disappointing experience and the only reason I give the album as much as 3 stars is because of the few highlights on the album. And the mixing job is nicely done, as well."
3,Focusing more on the Y?,"While the album isn't lacking in some great songs, namely Speed of Sound and Low, something just seems amiss about it and that seems strange with all the hype surrounding its release.Rush of Blood and Parachutes both contain material that seemed fresh and new and overall, both were great albums.Maybe that is the problem with X&Y.; The past two albums have said all that Coldplay are saying in this new album. They seem to be sticking with a formula that has previously worked instead of branching out and delivering something new and exciting. While this may work, it makes for quite a dull listen, seeming almost insipid.If you're a fan of Coldplay's earlier works you shouldn't be too disappointed - if you are not a fan of their earlier works, this one will not deliver anything to change your mind."
2,X&Y? More like Zzzzzzzz...,I've never quite understood the appeal of this band and just have to face the fact that I simply don't like them or their music. The songs do sound same-y and I hope that it's just that I haven't given it enough spins yet. Martin's voice sounds whiny and nasally and just annoying. It seriously grates.Save your dough and just buy an old Pointer Sisters record.
4,I hope The Album Leaf got paid.,"Okay, so the other day I was sitting at my desk, listening to the In An Off White Room EP by The Album Leaf. I got to the end of the track Off White Room, which is a really ambient track that is 29 minutes long. About 10 minutes of the song is just city noise. Anyways, to my point.At 2 minutes left in that song, I heard a part very familiar to me. So I went an listened to Talk by Coldplay.Guess what?Exact same melody and tempo of part. exactly. All Coldplay did was change the sound to guitar instead of synth.So, I'm just wondering if Coldplay stole that part or they paid The Album Leaf off for it. Either way, this album is not as original as Parachutes or A Rush Of Blood To The Head.Still great sing along music though."
2,Coldplay released the same album again?,"Man, call me nuts, but this album sounds just like the first one.... it's like: changhe the things a little bit and sell them the formula again....has catchy songs, but just because they seemed strangely familiar...Radiohead should be named king, and maybe U2 in second....Coldplay, I don't know where to put them... at least now..."
1,Falling away with the recycled Speed Of Sound,"I'm not interested in Coldplay. Typical of C.M. to make such a bad cd because they're snobby and untalented. I also get sick of hearing that spooky and pathetic single ""Speed Of Sound"" being played on TV very often. It gives me the icks. The whole cd gives me the icks. YUCK!!!!"
2,Sorry but this is a rehash of their old style,"I am sorry to say this because I like Coldplays earlier work. Unforutnatly this is exactly what X&Y; is -- a cold replay of their earlier work. Based on this album, the Band has not grown in terms of their music or the issues they deal with.I bought this album on the advice of a friend who said that they loved the band and this was the best yet. I guess they did love the band as they were -- because this is what we are getting. Unfortunatly, I was hoping to find a band that would grow and change as I have.If you want more of Parachutes and Rush of Blood, then go for it and revel. If you are looking for something more, then take a pass on this one."
4,"Their worst, but still great","This is their worst album, no questions asked, but it is still very good. Coldplay don't have a bad album and never will. The songs on this album are all good. The album grows on you with time, but there are not a lot of classic songs like on Rush Of Blood To The Head. Many great songs, but the other albums are better with catchier songs. I don't really see how anyone can dispute this."
1,I thank those wise enough to see beyond the hype...,"...for is not often the case that things which are keenly awaited are such a dissapointment when they arrive?Personally I have never found musical satisfaction in this band and I cannot understand quite how others do. The lyrics are the most contrived agony, anxst and neurosis, they are delivered with the kind of howling whine that would put a dying man in pain to shame and the monotony, oh god the monotony! It's like having to go on an endless walk in driving rain with no hope of ever finding shelter, a warm cosy fire and something nice to listen to!Time Chris the misery hung up his prozac and just stopped laying his highly glossed, depressive episodes at our feet, surely he has made enough money by now to leave us all alone and pay for some decent therapy? Oh and by the way Chris, buy a manual of Children's names while your at it and best you book Apple some self esteem classes, poor kid's gonna need em!"
2,A perfect example of the Loudness War,"This could have been a great album but the mastering is unbelievably bad.The drummer could have a set of rolled up carpets and a stick as a drum kit; you wouldn't be able to tell, as all the drums are a dull thud, and cymbal work is almost inaudible. It's a muddy wall of sound.If they turned the compression up any higher you would just be left with a constant 2 KHz sine wave.I suspect the earlier Coldplay albums dont suffer from this problem as much, but based on my experience this is one worth avoiding."
2,not one star worthy,"mostly because coldplay has some good work in their past. This is a band that is continually going to get worse until they are like U2. This band pretty much rips off U2 and radiohead and are BORING. Early U2 and radiohead are great, this band just survives by watering down what those bands did. ""speed of sound""? Seriously it's like coldplay covering coldplay, poorly. One of the most overblown albums that I can remember, right up there with american idiot...the only difference is that american idiot is a good album (it just gets way to much radio play).There are bands out there that destroy coldplay in every way....go searching for them."
3,Others must agree that these guys are simply average ...,"Look, I think coldplay makes wonderful BACKGROUND music and that is about it. I find the lead sings voice to sound very feminine and I do not dig that... They opened up #1 in everynation on the planet and when have record sales corresponded to talent in the last twenty years? Let them wash dishes for the next few years... You tell me gwennie would have given this gaunt looking lead singer a second look if they were not the ""in thing"", I say not... Book them to play in Fallujah this summer I say.."
2,Not the sum of it's parts,"I loved Coldplay's first two albums, but this disappointing offering shows us what happens when a BIG band wants to be too big for it's boots, but falls short by producing contrived and laboured songs, too pretentious for their own good.The only songs I like are, ofcourse, Speed of sound, which is a poor cousin to Clocks (which is one of the greatest songs EVER, I reckon) and that hidden track which sounds like Coldplay the way it used to sound before it produced X and Y. Simple but unforgettable."
2,Not as great as everyone makes it out to be,"When I hear this album all I can think is that I've heard all these tunes before. Not all of the tracks are good, and despite a few semi-excellent tracks [i.e. ""white shadows""], the rest of the album is bland and repetitive. Some of the lyrics sound downright pretentious to me, and none are jaw-dropping, though Chris Martin does manage to make them sound pretty.I see some hope for this band, but they've got to start being a little more innovative/original... the same formulaic rock over and over just isn't cutting it. 2/5 stars"
1,Recycled Corporate Crap,"A little known fact - This CD was actually reproduced. It was remade because coldplay thought the original CD ""didn't sound like coldplay"". I'm sure the original tapes were Solid Gold material but it probably scared the record company to death. shame for having a soul.I was a huge fan of coldplays first two records. But trust me, there is no song on this cd you'll want to listen to more than 5 times.I promise you, one year from today, you'll have forgotten you've ever bought this cd. This is not good material. Trust me and save your money, or don't trust me and find out after about 3 listens through."
1,"""Fix You"" is such an annoying song","God, that song is annoying. It's just such overwrought sugary crap. I feel a strong urge to suck on lemons after hearing that song. And why do all Coldplay videos feature the lead singer walking somewhere as he sings into the camera. Man, that band is annoying."
1,What happened?,"Loved Parachutes, loved Rush. Got this as soon as it hit the stores...never heard Speed Of Sound or anything prior to the release. Absolutely disappointed!!!Their trademark Brit sound is now slagged off for something which comes across as ""commercial sounds"" jumbled with ""A-Sure-Fire Hit across the Atlantic US-type mumbo jumbo rock"". In tryin to do well in the US, Coldplay has lost their British sounding roots. This is definitely a disastrous record."
5,pretty good,"This cd is pretty good. I had a copy before, but the this edition of it was worth the money. The extra songs are better then some of the tracks on the actual album"
1,crappy,"this album did not do it for me, it was really quite horrible, only 1 song is good and the rest sound the same and have no rhythm or purpose"
3,repetitious,"Although when you listen to music and you like a group, you want to be able to recognize their particular sound, the songs in this CD are too much the same as previous work. Disappointing."
3,Better Versions,"I love coldplay. They are absolutely one of my favortie bands, but this import version of the album isn't all it is craked up to be. First of all, the hidden bonus track isn't ""How You See The World"", it's ""Pour Me"". Secondly, there are better versions of this album out there. For example the Dutch Limited Edition which has all of the B-Sides up to ""Talk"" (""Hardest Part"" B-Sides are not on here) on a Bonus Disc. Over all I would not recommend this version of X&Y."
4,Another solid album from Coldplay,"This is pretty much more of the same from Coldplay - which is good or bad depending on what you were expecting. It's not a new or different sound, but I wasn't looking for one here, so I'm happy with the CD. If you're expecting something new, you'll probably be disappointed with this album. If you just want something else to follow ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" then you'll love this."
4,Pretty Good,"This cd has some good songs like Speed of Sound and Fix You. Though, this cd is good the first couple times you listen to it. (Like the First month or two) after that it's still good, just not as good. Overall I was very impressed with the lyrics and beats of it. 4 STARS!"
4,Coldplay at its best,"Every time an established band releases a new album, there exists the risk of the bands failure to keep with the noise that made them famous. All bands can now take note in what Coldplay did in their recent release of this album. They kept the sound that makes them wonderful and wrote a handful of songs that will continue to push them forward in the world of music.The songs written and performed are simply described as typical Coldplay. You get the heart-felt lyric, the pounding drum and bass line, the voice, and the overall sound. It is all the same as before and is made to sound well once again. I love nearly ever track on the CD. If you like what you found on the first album, if you like what you hear on the radio, and if you like Coldplay, then you will love this album.This is money well spent and candy to the ears."
5,Pink Floyd for this generation,"Coldplay. They are the Pink Floyd of this generation. When they entered the mainstream with their first album ""Parachutes"" most people compared them to Radiohead. Then when ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" came out they entered into their own category. Now with ""X & Y"" Coldplay keeps it coming. The first five songs on this album are spectacular. Their song ""Talk"" I hope catches the radio waves after ""Spead of Sound."" If you loved their second album you have to buy this one. You won't be disappointed."
4,Incredible.,"Wow! Just when you're wondering if Coldplay can keep it up or have blown all their cookies producing Parachutes and A Rush of Blood..., boy, do they kick you in the pants to put you straight. This is more complex, more dynamic, simply more dazzling than anything they've produced so far (well, except for The Scientist. Doubt if they'll ever top that!). Too cool by far. If you loved their other stuff, boy, are you going to writhe in ecstacy over this. Best tracks? I could say all of them, but if I have to narrow it down - What if?, Swallowed in the Sea, 'Til Kingdom Come. Buy this!"
4,best one yet,"This album is a fantastic work. I give it 4 stars due to some of the lyrics. Although the lyrics are sincere, they dance a little too close to ""just plain stupid."" The music, however, surpasses the previous albums by a huge margin. I feel that the debut was a great album but Rush of Blood was filler (I can only find 2 good songs on Rush, 5 or 6 being complete throwaways). By comparison, X&Y is quite consistent throughout. It is difficult to decipher which songs will be chosen as singles because the whole record is uniformly excellent. If they continue like this, they may have an impact equivalent to a fraction of U2. However, if Coldplay want to become U2, Chris Martin better pick up a thesaurus."
2,A HUGE disappointment...,"This album was more disappointing than I can even explain. To go from A Rush Of Blood To The Head to this just doesn't seem possible. But I guess it is since it happened. AROBTTH was a phenomenal album, I think most agree. But in this album, there are 3 tracks I can even remember to be somewhat good: Fix You, Swallowed By The Sea, and Kingdom Come. As for the rest, they're just kind of there.Incredibly disappointing."
1,DON'T BUY....for the love of beauty...REAL BEAUTY,"I'll be damned if any of my money goes to the maintenance of Gwyneth Paltrow's fake blonde hair. HEY, Mr. Martin....Mr. Live 8...Mr. ""Let's end world poverty""....YEAH YOU Mr. POLITIK, I'M TALKING TO YOU ......the cost of your wife's monthly root touch-up could feed an entire village.....FOR A YEAR!!! And the cost of her bi-weekly Brazilian wax could feed the neighboring village...FOR ANOTHER YEAR!!!! And the cost of youR luxury home in Belsize Park could feed both villages plus 5 more villages... UNTIL THE SUN BURNS OUT!!! You once asked, ""Am I the cure or Am I the disease?"" Well, you're the disease man. You're the Full Blown Spotted pus-filled DISEASE!!!! Regards to you and yours."
5,Brand New Old Friends,"I'm a newcomer to Coldplay and don't presume to add much to the praise that has come before me. But this album, after just one listen, felt like I was hearing songs I'd loved all my life: a very unusual sensation. This isn't the best music I've ever heard, but it's probably the most comfortable."
2,not as good as hyped up to be,"not to say that coldplay isn't awesome, but their latest album had me confused. after listening to the album on the bus and while walking, i felt as though i was listening to elevator background music, which is something i didn't expect to feel like while listening to coldplay. but anyways, definitely one to pick up if you like coldplay, however, newcomers should buy earlier stuff."
2,Stale Bread,"If you loved the first two, you'll eat up X&Y with a spoon. It offers an essentially identical sound as its predecessors. Loved the emo of ""The Scientist""? Now we have ""Fix You"". Thought ""Clocks"" was brilliant? Try out ""Speed of Sound"".However, to those who found Coldplay's past albums to be exhaustingly mediocre, X&Y isn't even worth the download nor the flexing of your mouth's musscels as you cringe to lyrics about cutting down a tree."
1,ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Some bands can pull off writing slow, drawnout songs with whinny lyrics. Coldplay can't, as this is the most boring thing that I have ever sat through. The problem isnt that they are slow, the problem is they are slow with no musical creativity. Bands like Radiohead and Pink Floyd have made a living of creating slow, dark, and depressive music. So why does it work with them and not coldplay? Musical integrity, Different Sounds, brillent guitar work...Coldplay does none of that, and I am falling asleep more as the CD goes on...Try on something different then this yucky yukca mess"
1,They Stink,"Predictable and careful. Boring and pretentious. I agree they have some hooks, yet they usually keep playing the same hook over and over again until you feel bludgeoned, a la ""Clocks""I am still waiting for them to ""hit one out of the park"" like they are supposed to. Maybe their fourth album will be an ""Unforgettable Fire"", and their fifth ""Joshua Tree."" but as of yet they are treading water."
1,Melodic Noise,"Coldplay has clearly fallen into a deep creative hole. 'Rush to the Head' was aptly named as that's the effect that outstanding piece of work has had on the band. X&Y is tiresome melodic noise repleat with overdone falsetto and obtuse, trite lyrics. The hype machine is working overtime on this one, so climb aboard with the others; I did. Buy the ticket and take the boring ride.."
1,"""WE'RE THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD"" - CHRIS MARTIN","The ""greatest thing since sliced bread""?How is making extremely commercial music (which is actually pretty easy to do) & going through no evolution make you ""the greatest thing since sliced bread"" Chris?... another example of a rock stars ego becoming bigger than their popularityChris also said that ""Low"" was unlike anything they've ever done because of how fast it is.... for him to think that 'Low' qualifies as a fast song proves just how truly lame this guys musical mind is.I believe there was one thing Chris Martin of Coldplay said that I do completely agree with""We're just dogs yapping at Radioheads heels""- Save your money for the new Pearl Jam album out sometime this year... a band that knows how to do sensitivity, while also keeping their balls firmly intact."
2,Comparison so you can understand,"i can only describe this album with the following analogy:its like when you are painting, and you mix every color and you get brown... that is what hearing this album feels like. Generic, brown, nothing shines, nothing surprises you, nothing is interesting, its just brown..."
2,Fails in Comparison,"The highly anticipated third album from Coldplay comes as a huge dissapointment. After all of the hype over it and considering how long they claim it took them to produce this album, I must say I am not impressed. There is nothing new to be found here and when compared to their first two albums, I believe they really took a couple of steps backwards here. I find the lyrics to be redundant, Chris Martin's voice begins to get on my nerves after the first five songs, and the rest of the band does not seem like they improved at all on their respective instruments. Hopefully they will take those much needed steps forward on their next album that I was so hoping for on this one."
1,TYPICAL FROM THEM,"i gave this album a chance because of it's ""Rave"" reviews and i wish i hadn't!!!! this is typical Coldplay, nothing different! this band gives british music a bad name!! i wish i could have gave this no stars!DONT BUY THIS!"
5,Better with every listen,"Though I love Coldplay's last two albums, I too was a bit skeptical if i'd like this. I watched the songs performed on MTV for the first time and just wasn't ""wowed"" by what i heard. But I also know I've loved about everything they've done previously, and that one listen of any new song/s never makes for a fair review - so I bought the album. As with ""Speed of Sound"" (having been released early and really sticking in my head - in a good way) I found once I began listening to the album, songs had stuck with me without my realizing. There were some, after just hearing a few times, I can't wait to listen to again and again. I think if you like Coldplay's other albums, this is definitely worth purchasing. Maybe it won't be your favorite, but your money won't be wasted. I give it 5-stars because I like what i hear, and I'm finding i'm growing to like it more and more with each listen - and that I can't say about too many albums."
2,"umm, not exactly coldplay's ""joshua tree""","maybe we should look back and consider Rush of Blood to the Head more like the close comparison, but even then the emo-coated lengthiness of the overtones of the...how do i describe these ridiculous songs? it seems every song whose title otherwise suggests a dramatic soundtrack-style masterpiece turns out to be a soppy un-original dissapointment that will forever make the band oasis' least favorite to see in concert, if not everyone's..."
2,For those of you too young...,"...to remember a band from the early 70's named ""Bread"", they were a band that produced very nice, never offensive, mellow music that was pretty popular there for a while.JUST like Coldplay, except Bread's singer wasn't annoying."
2,Boring,"The songs all sound the same. If you like Radiohead or Coldplay's first albums you will like Keane's ""Hopes and Fears"" much better."
3,Predictable,"Pop fodder, with crossover appeal; teen and housewife music. Sure to be on the soundtrack for next season's ER. The utter harmlessness of this popular band says something about our lackluster culture. Can't fault Martin or the rest, but this band just doesn't merit the accolades."
2,Far from great...,"I must have heard this album about a dozen or so times by now. One thing's for sure - I'm not in a hurry to hear it again). A shame as I really liked both Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood...Aside from the fifth-form poetry my biggest complaint is that the album's been produced to within an inch of its life. And, while it unquestionably sounds fabulous, the end result is an album bereft of any performance, complexity or depth.Great albums have an ability to surprise you despite the fact that you may have heard them hundreds of times before. There are no surprises here, everything happens just as it should and therein lies the problem."
3,A rush of blood to the knees.,"For me the best song in this collection is the hidden track Kingdom Come. It is a true surprise in it's honesty, simplicity, and sheer beauty. Perfect lemonade after a 12-song diet of sugary syrup. And too, it is a surprise as it is delivered in the manner of an after thought given it's position. The rest of the collection is clearly a worried-over effort that tries to best its predecessor. Sadly it doesn't.Here's how to fix the problem.Dummer. Simple highhat, kickdrum and snare. No more complex tom rythyms or chugga-chugga 16th notes. Play with your heart not your head.Guitarist. We like your style but you need to expand. Lead us down a path that seems obvious but then surprise us with things that touch the soul.Singer. Remember Politik, and A Rush of Blood to the Head? Don't sing to mortals, sing to gods. Less broken spirit stuff, we're not all broken hearted or lost or sad.Basist. You're fine.Please don't become the Styx of this century."
2,X&Y are next to last,Dissappointment from a great group.. The first 2 albums were fantastic. This is an unenthusaistic followup. I hope they regain their creativity and performance talent on the next album.
2,Rush of Blood to the Face that I paid $ for this CD,"2 stars is for the # of songs I can actually stand on this CD. I loved the 2 previous albums, but this one is whiney and concentrates mainly on the lead singer's voice, which isn't all that great. This album falls short of Coldplay's earlier work by an infinite amount. Too bad. I don't recommend it."
2,The Epitome of Mediocrity,"X&Y; is pretty dang close to being THE quintessential bland music album. The production is pretty-sounding, easy on the ears and doesn't demand attention. This is the perfect background music for people who are indifferent about music.The songwriting for the most part falls flat. The melodies seem to be trying so hard to be something great but ultimately fail to stand out. Probably the strongest melody line on here is the one they copped from Kraftwerk. Most of the songs are forgettable or downright impossible to remember, as they mostly sound very similar. Also, the album is fairly long for how little it has to offer. There are hardly twelve songs worth of musical ideas here.In short, X&Y; is the epitome of mediocrity. The absoluteness of that mediocrity, (ironically) is what makes it both remarkable and despicable."
4,"I don't hate it, but I don't love it","I hate to say it, but I love A Rush of Blood to the Head much more than X&Y.; I want to love it, but right now I just can't. After listening three times it's still growing on me. It'll take time.Here's what I do like: I love the fact that the music is different. Musical artists should really strive to achieve this as their career progresses and if they want to stick around. I love that Coldplay has finally released new material and that this new effort still sounds like them.Favorite tracks:Square One- a really good openerX&Y-; should be the next singleSpeed of Sound- obvious choice, didn't like it at first, but hear it 2or more times a day everywhere and now like itFix You- next single, and a nice balladA Message- another good ballad and love the messageSo skeptics and big fans of Coldplay like me, give X&Y; another chance. Give it a few more chances even. Just because its Coldplay. With a little time, it will grow on you."
5,Stunning ! Great ! Exceptional !,"I don't get the ""dissapointment trend"" going on. This album is very good and Coldplay didn't dissapoint at all. Yes they are everywhere on the media right now and yes everyone is talking about them but this doesn't bother them because they are great musicians and they know how to construct a challenging and also relaxing album. Don't waste another minute and BUY THIS !"
2,unhappy customer,I still haven't received this item. I've e-mailed the vendor to check with status and I never received a replied. I'm very upset...
2,I never really got into this bad.... You know why?????,"Becuse Radiohead did it better with Ok computer, Which this band is ripping off.......This album was really a letdown"
1,what this album needs,"I wish Chris Martin would consider a gospel track with Bette Midler on his next CD. That is what this album needs is a track with Bette Midler, it might have sold more copies. Coldplay has come a long way since their song on The Bodyguard soundtrack, which was subpar."
2,Dissappointed,"After all the hype and everyone telling me how great this CD was I finally broke donw and got it. Needless to say I was very dissappointed. I really like ""Speed of Sound"" but the rest of the album is worthless IMO. Every song sounds basically the same to me. Just my 2 cents"
3,huge let down,"Is this the same coldplay that released Trouble, or Green Eyes, Or In My Place? This album is a huge let down, but due to their past great songs i couldnt bring myself to rate it lower than a 3.It would have been nice if the band decided to show up for a few tracks....Coldplay tried too hard on this album, all the lyrics sound so forced. Speed of Sound is a nice song, its alright (it aint clocks tho). Fix You is a really nice song, probably the best. Everything else is pretty bad. They tried to have abstract, yet comprehensible lyrics, all they turned out was crap.Coldplay is still a good bad and i'll still be listening to their old songs but this album is a HUGE let down..."
5,How do they do what they do so well?,"I have all 3 albums, this most recent one is a little adventurous but they come back before they lose it, you can tell they are testing other styles, but they still manage to retain what makes them coldplay.Another inspiring album, perfect for just listening to alone.Even if you didnt like the first album, i suspect one may like this, its different enough for non listeners to tune into.The standout song in my mind is ""square one."" enjoy"
4,give it a chance.....,"i was actually tempted to give this one 3 stars at first. the first few listens were quite disappointing. but it was bound to be. coldplay was following up on one of the best modern rock albums ever made. i knew they wouldn't equal or top ""rush of blood to the head"". a band always gets more processed, tries to make it's music more ""mainstream"" as they get more popular. it's a shame. but give it a few more listens, and it does grow on you. i promise. there sure isn't anything else better out there right now (if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know) just don't expect it to be ""rush"". oh, and by the way, the ""cross between U2 and radiohead"" comments are absolutely correct, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. :)"
3,X&Y,Great Lyrics;Nice to listen in the car while traveling down the NJ Turnpike.Soothes the soul. I had not listened to this popular group beforebut I am glad that I did. Definitely a Coldplay fan..Jeffrey
2,Um... No,"Coldplay definitely has a lot of talent, and prove it with a few songs. I'd like to know what happened with all the other tracks. The two previous albums were better, but you still hit the skip button too often. Speed of Sound is way too hyped.. a great song but not worthy of all the praise its gotten. Talk is good, and so is square one. and the J Cash cover, til kingdom come (the bonus track) is excellent, but not even their own really. So that makes 4 good songs, inmy opinion, out of 13 tracks.. not even 1 out of every 3.I recommend saving your money and downloading some of their songs and making a mix. Unless of course you'll buy a cd for one or 2 good songs.But if you really want to buy coldplay, or are new to the band, ""a rush of blood to the head"" is probably the best to start with. It's easily their best cd with the most creative sound. i'd say about half is good and the other half isn't. typical coldplay however."
1,Mainstream Mediocrity,"Ah, another example of mainstream mediocrity. All those fatcats are playing this on the airwave over and over and over into our brains until we just cannot think! Please! There is still time! Buy Franz Ferdinand's new cd and be protected from this pile of craptacular goodness."
2,Mmmm....lazy risk free stuff,"I don't know which is worse - Coldplay's corporate risk free reproduction of Rush Of Blood To The Head or Radiohead's total reinvention after OK Computer.A mix of the two would be nice - some risks coupled with some tunes.Coldplay have opted for the safe bet and the fans should vote with their feet.Unfortunately, this is going to be a massive seller"
3,ubiquitous,"This album hits the spot nicely, and I was pleasantly surprised by it - at first.Then I started hearing it everywhere; it seems no one can produce a television show, film a commercial, or run a coffeeshop without using a track (or ten) from X&Y.; If Chris Martin & Co were looking to create a soundtrack to life in 2005, they succeeded.My advice is to skip the purchase and just walk into your local Barnes and Noble - you're sure to hear it.It's a good album, but it's wearing thin."
1,X & Why Bother?,This album is a piece of crap...I don't see how anybody could give this five stars unless they're are just as empty and devoid as this cd. I happen to like Coldplay's last two albums but the music sounds as formulaic as the album title. I thought that Coldplay would try to branch into a new sound that could inspire me more than their more deliberate commercial release of Rush of Blood to the Head but X&Y is as lively as a rotting animal curled up by the side of the highway.
4,excellent,"One of the things that gives songwriters staying power is the gift for a great melody. Coldplay demonstrates this talent thoroughly on X&Y;, showing that their previous efforts were not a fluke. They have real talent. The songs are catchy, with melodies that are innovative but very musical. Chris Martin's lyrics are heartfelt and seem drawn from real-life experience, touching on real emotional issues. ""Fix You,"" for example, deals with trying to help someone else through a difficult experience.I have continued to listen to ""Rush of Blood to the Head"" regularly since it came out. X&Y; has the same persistent appeal. I'm glad I bought it, and I don't buy many new albums these days."
2,Big disappointment,Compared to the band's first two CDs this is a piece of junk. There is not one single track with the kind of passion present on Parachutes or Rush of Blood To The Head. Makes me wonder how much time was spent arranging the songs.
3,"Good, but not great by any means.","The album gets off to a roaring start. Square One is an amazing song. Hey, great bands can't be near perfect all the time the way A rush of Blood to the head was. U2 didn't achive the same greatness of Actung Baby or the Joshua tree with Atomic Bomb. Give Coldplay credit for NOT trying to remake Blood to the head. It's hard to deny the 80's influence on this album- and it will no doubt be huge. The songwriting is a bit weak this time around- but overall a pretty solid record."
4,GIVE THIS ALBUM MORE TIME,"Any person who reviews this album ON THE DAY IT COMES OUT is an absolute MORON. Take your time, listen to it for a while. I absolutely worship ""Rush of Blood"" and love ""Parachutes"", but I've been listening to them for a very long time now. Rome wasn't built in a day, so listen and let ""X&Y;"" grow on you. I've listen to ""Rush"" for two years now and I find new things I like every time I listen to it. When I first got ""Rush"" I listened to a few songs and then threw it over my shoulder. But when I came back later and really started listening to it, it grew into my favorite album of all time.So give ""X&Y;"" time to grow, because patience will make you appreciate this album even more.P.S.: This album really is pretty darn good already."
2,A let down,"After discovering Coldplay by hearing and enjoying ""Rush"", this is a big disappointment. The music sounds like one long song split 14 different ways, and left on the floor from the previous cd. Coldplay will need to make some dramatic changes to their next cd, otherwise I'll be looking elsewhere for some new music."
1,Finally! a cure for an insomniac!,"The name of the band is like the explaination for that horrible music blaring out of the radio speakers. They are so dull that I'd probably fall asleep before I got thru the first song... The singer's voice sounds like nails on a chalk board. Truly these songs sound like remixes of their old songs (ehhem, clocks).Invest your money into something else besides this untalented man's sad, depressing, sound-like-your-dying, and DULL as sin music.The only reason I'd buy this CD is if I needed a cure for insominia or perhaps some music for a funeral of someone you hated."
1,"Eh, nice.....if you like template music","I couldn't help thinking how much Coldplay reminds me of Salieri who tried so hard to be better than Mozart. The problem with Coldplay is that they try just too darn hard... real talent is more effortless and natural. The best bands focus on their art and content; they don't sit around and deliberate which marketing strategy they should take in order to please their listeners. They have their own sounds and styles that will withstand the time. Coldplay writes pleasant music, but it's the type of sound that's liked at the moment but will soon be forgotten, like The Monkeys, like Salieri. In a nutshell, it's just not nice to ripe Radiohead or U2 music and have the guts then to proclaim you're one of the best bands in the world. In this world of mass marketing, maybe you will be ""successful"", but you'll never earn the musical respect bestowed on the truly talented. Sorry, but the Radiohead complex is still obviously there."
3,overrated,these guys are talented but their recent music just seems lame in comparison to the last album which was a great and refreshing hit record.
3,"It IS cold, AND playful!","My friend Jerry said this album wasn't as good as another album he recently purchased. Well, I want to tell you that Jerry's as big a fool as you'll find in any comedy club in Sacramento. Clearly, this album can't stop vampires from attacking your family, but it WILL be played in your CD player (if you buy it and put it into your CD player and play it).The music features notes and rhythms, with all sorts of notes. There's a singer, and I can tell you from experience, music with a singer makes the lyrics come alive!Also, if you don't know who X and Y are, this album might solve that mystery, with its powerful lyrics. If you had been in this band, you'd know that this album was recently released. Don't stop buying this, and make sure it's got the lyrics somewhere in your house!Morley"
2,Disappointed,"I enjoyed _A Rush of Blood to Your Head_, but was disappointed by this new album. Unpoetic lyrics set to random tunes."
4,A great new direction,"I love the new direction that Coldplay is going in with this album. I think they really have stuck to their roots as musicians, but it really allows the listeners to see where they have come since Parachutes. The hype of this album was not a let down in this case. I was worried because of all the publicity they were doing for this record.""Low"" is a really great kind of new song for Coldplay the tempo of the song is fast from the beginning there isn't really any lead up to the song speeding up. This song is really powerful and brings a new element to the album.The hidden track was a really good choice because it was originally written by Johnny Cash song that he didn't have a chance to record so Coldplay decided to record it. This song is a really great closing for the album. It gives us a chance to see their versatility as musicians.Overall this is a great album and a must buy! I loved it from the second I put it on."
5,So Addictive - So Epic,"I am officially addicted to ""X&Y."" This CD plays like a great movie. It has these great cinematic melodies with larger than life orchestral like sounds. This album has more of an epic quality. It just operates on a grander scale. ""X&Y"" could be a feature soundtrack. It's so Oscar worthy. Coldplay created something that has more than one dimension. I just feel like there are so many different levels and reveals. At times it's very intricate with lots of little flourishes and details. This CD requires repeat listening just to absorb it all. The title is sweet and simple, but the overall texture is inherently complex. The presentation is very straightforward and it all blends and flows very well. Therefore, it's very accessible and enjoyable. But if you really pay attention, you'll discover different geometries. It's not redundant. All of their songs are very interesting. Their music draws you in and takes you places that you'd never expect. It's like a great fairy tale at times."
2,and it was all mellow...,"I guess this is what they mean by adult alternative rock. Although I will never understand why music which can sell 20 million albums can be anything but mainstream.I kinda liked ""Yellow"" but found the rest of Parachutes a little too twee and precious. Now, Rush of Blood to the Head, I hated initially but it grew on me and how! The influence of Echo & the Bunnymen was strong and I loved the psychedelic nuances and wasn't ""The Scientist"" simply gorgeous?Which brings us to X&Y; and COldplay is suddenly carrying EMI on its back... the new Beatles, wow!Overall, X&Y; lacks the conviction of Rush of Blood, with Martin and co repeating the formula a little too often for comfort. Do we need a fifth remake of ""The Scientist""? And how do you take the moaning of a rock millionaire seriously anyway? Cobain notwithstanding.So I giving this the thumbs down, it leaves me cold. Ask me at the end of the year, and it'll be in my top albums of 2005. Probably."
1,Music for shopping malls and armpit commercials,"Chris Martin must be the luckiest student on earth.It's amazing that a band that started as a Jeff Buckley rip-off got so big.Anyway, this album is not as good as Parachutes.Or even ROBTTH , which was ok anyway.Terrible music for tv commercials and shopping malls."
2,Bring back coldplay!,"I was very excited with the initial reviews of the album...after hearing it though...I am wondering exactly what all the fuss is about. Gone are the melancholic romantic songs from the past...usher in U2. I did find the Kraftwork rip-off interesting though...catchy! But not cutting edge, and only remotely interesting. Sorry to all the die hards out there...bring back the old coldplay sound and feel and I'll return to the fray."
4,X&Y,"I was not too interested, when I first bought this disc. After a couple days it grew on me, personal favesinclude square one, talk, and what if."
2,Crap,"I enjoyed Coldplay's first 2 albums. This however is crap. There is nothing innovative at all on the disc. It is as if they found a formula for what sells their music and stuck within that framework alone. The annoying elements of earlier work were used at every turn and it ammounts to recycled, manufactured, trash. To whatever critic compared them to radiohead: HOW DARE YOU!"
2,Booorrrrring,"Why is this band so popular? I have no dislike for them, unlike the emo rock bands that are shoved down our throat and proclaimed to be ""so talented"" just because they have a cool video, but nothing Coldplay does is remarkable. Quite simply, their music is boring. Like I said I don't hate but it but I don't understand why its a recipe for overwhelming popularity. Oh well."
1,Goodbye earthlings,Any world where the likes of Chris Martin and his completely average band Coldplay is considered genius is a world I CANNOT and WILL NOT be a part of. The abject ordinariness is weighing me down and I must be free. It is about time I made my return to which I came.....I am of the stars.
3,not ok computer,The first thing that comes into my head about X&Y is that although different from their last albums it does not have the changes to make it an OK computer.It starts off well with square one and what if which are two good songs but white shadows lets its self down it is a dull song and the lyrics dont make much sense.Fix you is a great song maybe the best on the album.It is a typical coldplay song whith a great climax.Talk is a good song but i felt the let themseleves down by not letting it go full rip.The title song is crap despite what anybody says.Speed of sound is a carbon copy of clocks which doesnt make a bad song just not origanal.A message is the same as green eyes as coldplay stick with the stuff they know.Low is alright but it takes to long to get going.The hardest part is coldplay at their parachutes best.Catchy and martin at his best.The last 3 songs are alright but get tiresome after a while.Overall not a great album.
5,Not Happy,"While I love the sound of Coldplay, so far I have not been able to listen to the album in my laptop or in my ipod.The record company have Copy Control software so that you cannot listen to the album as most of us do, in ipods or on laptops.Well done EMI, I for one will never buy any copy controlled CD's again, as my rights were totally taken from me with this album and Gorillaz latest.Beware buyers, you are being cheated big time."
2,Weak,"Musically dull; vaguely reminiscent of The Cure but not as good. I was given this CD as a gift. After listening to it, I told her she could keep it."
1,THAT'S IT! I HAVE JUST HAD IT WITH STUPIDPLAY!!!,"Coldplay think they're the best, but actually, they're not. They're really a group of untalented twenty-eight year olds.""Fix You"" is another junky sing-along with Chris Martin.I have never really been a gigantic fan of Coldplay myself. I'm nearly ten, and have hated Coldplay for a month or so. Coldplay used to be really good, but now they're not."
1,Wholly lifeless.,"Well why do you suppose this is such disappointingly dull commercial sap? Is it just genetics? Or the result of large egos, large checks and no talent? Either way it presents us with a valid case for abortion."
5,the melodies have a noel gallagher esque feeling!,"take ""what if""! it sounds like an oasis melody! fantastic! it goes straight to the ear! martins voice is also great!"
1,Highly Overated,"I thought I'd give this album a listen because so many people told me it was great. I listened and listened and I just couldn't get into Coldplay. Every song sounds the same and I just find the band to be boring and over-hyped. Maybe it's just me, I really wanted to like it. But after listening to it, I was thinking "" So what? What's so great about this band?... Oh yeah, the singer Chris Martin is married to Gwyneth Paltrow! That's why!"" Who cares! Oh... I'm going to get it for this one..."
4,A very good effort,"After just one listening, I didn't feel this is as good as their previous album, but I still liked most of the songs. The first single, Speed of Sound, is a great song and I suspect there will be a few more singles that will be well-received. And, I suspect I will like this album better after a few more listens. As for comparisons to U2 or Radiohead, I don't get it: they don't sound like either--they just sound like themselves. So like them or not--but give this album a chance because it deserves it!"
3,The SONG remains the same,"Remember when rock groups would alter their style and take chances, exploring thier abilities and taking rock music in new directions? Like Led Zeplin? (Houses of the Holy)I also anticipated this release, and was also hoping for a SONIC UPGRADE as previous CD'S were poor recordings that delivered a harsh reality. But you overlooked the poor recording because the music was so good.My recent upgrade to the Theta Digital Dreadnaught II amp improved the early recordings somewhat, but Steely Dan AJA quality they weren't.SO IMHO, this new highly hyped release offfers not much more than I already have with the 2 superior previous recordings.I hear less rock and more whinning in this release, surely to inspire another Mad TV parody. Sorry CP fans, I say what I feel, not what I think you want to hear.IMHO, one or two good songs do not save a CD, if its good, its good ALL the way through.D"
2,More of the same,"If you really insist on buying into the Coldplay hype this album will be right up your alley. For the few sane people in the audience, keep listening to the Yeah Yeah Yeah's till the New York Dolls record comes out!"
5,Copy Protected!,"This album is copy protected! I can't use it the way I want to (in the car, on my work pc, on both my home pc's, extracting songs for my party compilations and so on (i never bring original discs out to a party)) so I sent it back.The only way you and I can tell the record companies that we don't like the way they're kicking our butts adding this sort of ""technology"" is by returning their crippled discs back to the store, or even better, steer clear of buying them. The latter is pretty hard since the record companies are denying the online shops to _mark_ the releases as crippled (copy protected).I support the artists, it's the record companies that needs a wake-up call! They slept in the class (the nineties) when the digital stuff took off and we're now paying for their blunders.Sad, really. The only business making money of this mess is the postal service (by shipping crippled items back and forth)."
4,Excellent CD!!!!!,"At about 8:30 this evening, I went to the mall to check out this cd. I bought it for 10 dollars and rushed home to put it in my cd player. I ripped off the plastic, opened the cd, and put it in. From the first minute or so, I could tell that this cd was going to be great. Interesting lyrics, soft instruments, and a nice voice on top, this cd is awesome. I like every song, but it is a little too soft. I would recommend this cd to everybody because it is a very good cd and it has been number 1 for 3 straight weeks and it deserves to be. I have never listened to Coldplay before this album, but I am happy that I did pick up this cd because it is very good and is one of the best cd's this year."
2,"Oh, ARGH...","The appearance of Brian Eno seals it: we're listening to Coldplay as U2 Jr. on this album, and man... it's a crying shame. I thought PARACHUTES was a pretty decent album, and thoroughly enjoyed A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD (despite the fact that, at its greatest moments, the latter cribs directly from The Chills' criminally-overlooked masterpiece, 1990's SUBMARINE BELLS); however, if you close your eyes, and allow the stadium-sized vocals and the processed-guitar army of X&Y to overtake you, you can almost see Bono and Edge manifest themselves in your mind. I'd suggest that Mr. Martin and Co. go back to The Chills. We've got way too much U2 in the world as it is."
2,Perfect... for a nap,"Here it is! The album that Coldplay try to become U2, and Chris Martin bemoans a bunch of troubles he's not actually having. Rule #1 - you don't make lovesick music when you're married to a wealthy Hollywood actress. Rule #2 - U2 is the most bloated band of the last 20 years, and you should not model your band after THAT. Seriously, this is the most over-hyped, overrated, boring music to be released with such anticipation. Guitar riffs are repeated over and over again, and the band apparently tried to recreate ""Clocks"" 12 different ways for this album. Their first two albums were a great alternative to the genre, but this is just a shame. By the time I make it to ""Swallowed in the Sea"" I just feel like yelling ""shuuuut up"" and smashing this disc into a fine dust. Kiss your precious Coldplay good-bye... they have become Matchbox 20 (**shiver**)."
2,ON A SCALE FROM A TO D...,"I give X & Y a ""C."" I've listened to it numerous times now. It's my least favorite CD from them. Every track is forgettable, extremely ho-hum. With all honesty, I think these guys have way more potential and for some strange reason they're being held back. Take older tracks Like ""Bigger Stronger,"" ""Where is My Boy?"" and ""Your Love Means Everything Part 2."" This is the Coldplay I love.Don't get me wrong...they're talented as !@$% and put on one hell of a live performance.Just my two and 3/4 cents. Oh!...and two stars maybe a little too harsh. I'd give it 3.See you all on Aug. 19th at Shoreline."
3,something tells me I've been here before...,"I liked ""X & Y"" better when it was called ""A Rush of Blood To The Head"" and it was the year 2002."
1,Horrible Horrible album! Utter and complete rubbish!!!,"Coldplay is a very good band. I think the best record they evermade was, ""Parachutes"". This album is like a bad mixture of Franz Ferdinand and Beck. I have never really listened to the songs on,""Blood rushing to the head"". X+Y, this album, STINKS!The worst song on the album (in my opinion)is ""Speed Of Sound. The song, to me, sounds spooky and scary (in my opinion). Who wants to listen to thatstupid song when it sounds like somthing you'd hear when you were at a phantom funeral in your dreams? Well, not me! On theirfirst album(Parachutes), the most amazing song on the album was,""Yellow"". I really hated the first song on X+Y, ""Square One"". That's yet another spooky song on the album. Chris Martin's voice gets rather spooky, too. Coldplay didn't do a very good album!"
1,Worse than OK Computer by Radiohead!,"There are few sounds in this world that irratate me more than the grating falsetto caterwaul of Chris Martin and the talentless hacks known as Coldplay. What is wrong with this man's voice? (...) Either that or maybe he's just been huffing helium. Either way, his voice makes for quite an excruciating listen! This CD sounds like a 2005 version of Radiohead's awful 1997 ""classic"" OK Computer. And I hate that album with an extreme passion that can't be expressed with words!Aside from Chris's helium voice, the music is spooky, dreary, and depressing, like something you'd hear during a nightmare. Who listens to this stuff anyway? Hearing music like this doesn't entertain me, it just bums me out! Who actually ENJOYS being depressed? That's right, nobody, so why buy an album that is more depressing than a funeral? It'll only make you miserable, so stay away from this pretentious band."
3,It's the same,"I don't think it's a good CD because it's all the same. It's like this CD is one long song. It's boring. The only good track is the first single. They should re-invent theirselves. Artists like Missy Elliott are more creative with their albums. Go and buy Missy's new album instead of this ""crap"". OK It's not really crap but it's not my favorite. I'm used to hear better CD's than this one."
2,It's just not that good.,"I love Coldplay but I must say I'm extremely disappointed. I think the expectations were that the guys just couldn't go wrong with this album -- after all, their first two were so amazingly great. Unfortunately, X & Y is barely mediocre and just downright boring. There are only two standouts of the 13 songs: ""Speed of Sound"" and ""Square One."" The rest just seem to blend into one another, creating a sort of a drone. Thankfully I don't think I'll ever tire of their first two albums, and I've already replaced X & Y in my car CD changer with Rush of Blood. Now THAT'S good Coldplay."
3,The Gwynneth Factor,"Not to be rude to Mr. Martin, but a band's raison d'etre changes when what was attained becomes reality. Coldplay produced a great sustaiable album (no mean feat) when they released AROBTTH, but this new album faces challenges that the casual Cldplay fan might expect, and more. Firstly, you are expected to live up to - not alone surpass - your last album; secondly, Martin is supposed to keep his ""music for the massses"" sensibility after his marriage and fatherhood.The songs are elegant and climactic, yet without soul. Many of us had heard of the tortured songs they'd disregarded - two album's worth - before coming up with X&Y; . I only hope that they're worthier and surface later.I felt that the band was in trouble when ""Speed of Sound"" was released. While by no means the weakest song on the album, it was a strong portent of an album that could have been better.Overall, Coldplay's X&Y; is still a well-crafted album, but very forgettable compared to its predescessors."
2,Beginning to slip?,"I am a casual fan of Coldplay but I do own both their albums 'Parachutes' and 'A Rush Of Blood To The Head' on CD, but after hearing many of the songs on X&Y; elsewhere I don't think I will be purchasing it. Why?I agree with another reviewer who said that Coldplay's lyrics seem to be subpar than the ones on their earlier albums. Also there don't seem to be any real memorable melodies except for 'Fix You' and just (and I really do mean JUST) 'Speed Of Sound'.If you are thinking of buying this album I'd wait until you can get it much cheaper on ebay."
2,after one listen:,"Coldplay doesn't evolve on this album. Rather, it sounds like an attempt at greatness that went awry. The sound is bloated, overly U2-ish, and ultimately, it doesn't sound like Coldplay. In other words, they strayed too far from their musical identity."
1,U2 wannabe's!,"I heard a song on the radio off of this CD, and I would have bet my trailer home that it was U2! I couldn't believe it! Really I couldn't. Anyways, the way I look at it, if you can't be original then why be a cheap imitation of rock's greatest band?? That's what I'd like to know. The only reason that I think most people have any interest in these guys is that the lead singer is married to Gwyneth Paltrow. You don't have to agree with me, but you've got to admit that I'm entitled to my opinion. Keep the rubber side down, and I'll see you at Sturgis. Carry on."
1,What Can I Say,"Well America old friend, all I can do is apologise that my fellow Englishmen have inflicted this flavourless drek on the rest of you. It will sell millions, just like the hamburger drek you have inflicted on us. Perhaps its Karmic retribution for that, and electing Dubya. If you want to buy British music, and Lord knows you have lots of your own, listen to the Kaiser Chiefs, although frankly if you find Coldplay exiting, the Kaisers might be a bit rich for your blood, you may prefer a mug of hot milk and your slippers. In a similar genre Snow Patrol are FAR superior."
4,Effective Resource for PTSD in Children,"I first used Therapeutic Stories by Nancy Davis while working as an elementary counselor in Iowa City. I found the stories to be an excellent technique for discussing sensitive topics with traumatized children. One of the stories, The House and the Hurricane, allowed me to communicate with a severely withdrawn child. The story helped her to express the emotional pain and fear of being with others. From this story we were able to move to a concrete plan for building social supports at school. Many other stories are equally valuable. I urge any therapist who deals with traumatized children to check out this resource. With over five hundred pages it is like many books combined into one program."
1,poorly written,"Great plot idea, which is the only the reason I read it even though it was written badly. Some books flow nicely and just make sense. This didn't. It was like trying to read through mud. I not even sure what happened in the book the words were so poorly written. If it was written better, this book could have been absolutely wonderful. The idea about two people getting married, then getting seperated, changing theirs names and then finding each other, falling in love again and not knowing that they were who they were was really great. This is the only Fern Micheals book I have read, so it's possible that she's not a bad author, and that this is just the worst thing she ever wrote. Meaning, perhaps her other books are very good."
2,Disappointing,"I read the back cover of this book before reading it and it sounded very good. I really enjoyed this Fern Michaels book until near the end when Ariel and Lex realize that they are long lost lovers. This is the second time I've been disappointed by a Fern Michaels book. I am beginning to believe she just is unable to deal with any kind of ""surprise"" in a book without completely blowing it. There is no lead up or thought on either of the characters parts before they realize who the other is, it just happens. I even flipped back to the beginning of the chapter to see if I missed something, but I didn't. All this book was is another terrible disappointment. It had the opportunity to be great but ended up not living up to it's potiental."
1,WISH I DIDN'T READ THIS,"If you can imagine Sylverster Stalone and Steven Segal picking avacadoes, this books for you, otherwise don't bother."
4,good book,"Ì have just received this item and I definetively do not have any regrets about it. Good condition, great illustrations and lovely story to tell to my child!"
5,Wonderful book,I bought this book for my youngest granddaughter for Christmas. She loves books with bright colors. Her daddy reads a book to her every night before bed and this one fits the bill.
1,This CD is a Hack,"This is not a review of the material from the book or the author performance of it. Those are great.The makers of this cd should be condemed. Not only are there no chapters, making it one long track on each disc, but there is a spot a few minutes into disc two where some audio is left from the tape version. It says ""end of side two.""They made Hitchhikers discs with many tracks, did they become lazy. . . or cheap. . . or both. Damn irritating."
3,Puzzlingly,"I read this for a book club. Frankly did not understand it too much. I am going to try again soon. I think I do not have the proper understanding for this type of book. The Hobbits puzzled me , I never even accepted Star Wars and I wondered why Harry Potter was so great. I think it is my failing ."
3,End of the Universe Falls Short,"While this second book in the hitchhiker series is amusingly satirical, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe falls short of laugh-out-loud funny. Some lines will have you smiling at society's stupidity and your own conformity to it, but the overall feeling of the book is simply sci-fi run amuck. I admit that the themes that run throughout the series are intriguing, but the effort it takes to sort through the layers of insanity makes the read almost unworth it. If you have nothing to do, pick up a copy, but don't plan on joining the hitchhiker cult any time soon."
3,worst then the first,"If you read the first book in this series and really liked it then you should definitly get this book, otherwise don't get it. I didn't like this book very much because the charachters are not well developed at all and the only good quality that the book has is humor, and it's lacking in that. It's not suspensful, you don't get very involved in the story, and as I said, only get it if you REALLY liked the first book."
4,Whacked-Out Nonsense,"The second book in the trilogy is a hilarious, mind-boggling, freak-out. The only problem would (and I didn't have to deal with this) is it is utterly incomprehensible to people who never read book one. Thankfully all I need to read is So Long, And Thnaks For All The FishDouglass Adams is a genius!"
4,"Hilarious, odd and interesting to the last.",The Restaurant at the end of the Universe is the second book in the Popular HitchHiker's Guide Series. Though not as funny or interesting as the HitchHiker's Guide this is a book you will wan't to read more than once.
5,The best of the series!!!!,"If you have read The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy, you will love this one! The hitchhikers travel the galaxy in search for a place to eat. The nearest place was Milliways, The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe. The only promblem is, when they leave they steal the stuntman, Hotblack Desiato's side ship. In the ship they travel 2,000 years back in time and then teleport at the last second, splitting the hitchhikers apart. Now Ford and Arthur are on prehistoric Earth, where they find the shocking truth about the earth's history...."
3,Not As Good As the First,"Yeah, this one defintely wasn't as good as the first. I didn't really know what was going on and the plot just seemed to plod along. By the end, I didn't really know what the point was, other than that Arthur and Ford seemed lost...? I think there was a bubble bath, too. Maybe I'm just not paying attention. I was pretty tired today when I finished it.It was funny, though, even if it was pretty scatterbrained. I love Marvin. And the scenes at the restaurant cracked me up. I might read the sequels, but I'm not in a hurry. I go in phases where I like science fiction and then I kind of get out of it."
5,The Sequel Is Better Than The First Book!,"The second installment of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy picks right up where the first book left off. The subtle humor of this second volume is much more entertaining than the first. If you are at all a fan of the recently revived TV show Futurama, you will emensely enjoy this series of books as the humor is very similar. By the end of the volume, you find out what the question is to Life, The Universe and Everything (the answer to which was 42)...assuming that this is not changed in a future volume. Anyway, the journey through this book is much more entertaining than the first book and the fact that The Restaurant at the End of the Universe actually refers to a time and not a place will give you a great idea as to the type of off-the-wall concepts you will find in this book. Very entertaining and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. Recommended."
4,LAUGH OUT LOUD HILARIOUS,"This is the book that introduced me to Douglas Adams and his wacky sense of humor. At first I had no idea what was going on the book, but it was a thin book so I decided to keep reading. The one part that really makes this book memorable--and worth reading--is the end. There are few books that can make me laugh out loud. This is one of them."
2,A definate let down,"After reading the first volume, I was looking forward to this one. What a disappointment! This book went around and around and ended up no where.Save your money. If you enjoyed the first volume, be satisfied. That's as good as it gets."
2,13 year old male,This book is not good for a 13 year old. It has little plot and makes human seem stupid and foolish. The author has some great ideas but he is not the kind of guy I would make friends with.Also 5 times 9 is not 42!!!
2,12 year old male,This book is not good for a 12 year old. It has little plot and makes human seem stupid and foolish. The author has some great ideas but he is not the kind of guy I would make friends with.Also 5 times 9 is not 42!!!
1,you people are crazy!,"It is very evident that people who don't have a clue what exactly real humor is gave this book more than three stars. This book is so terrible that I wouldn't even force Jesse Helms to read it in an attempt to torture him. If someone says that this book is good, then run because they're probably mentally unstable."
3,"A table in the back, please","More like 3.5 stars. This follow-up to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy begins almost immediately where the first book left off. It is again very funny with some interesting social and moral ideas underneath the silly situations. I gave it a lower rating because the whole thing seemed a little forced. It went on longer than the first book and with no good reason. Their is almost no plot at all in this one and the science behind the Restaurant at the End of the Universe gets a little convoluted. A good read, but not as good as the first book."
3,a must read,"dont be discouraged, 3 is my lucky number, so it is the best i can give it. the beggining was really funny but then the jokes dwindled. sometimes it was hard to follow but was always interesting and one of the best books i ever read. i didnt read the first one but it didn't matter, reading the back was enough. a must read!!!!!"
4,not as good as the first,This book was good but not as good as the first. After Zaphod got out of the soul destroyer it was all downhill from there
5,The best of the series ...,"I liked this book more than any other in this amazing series. Somewhere around page 30 (I rememeber this even though I read this book 18 years ago) if you aren't hysterical with laughter, you need to see a doctor."
5,The peak of hitch-hiker's series,"This is absolutely the best book in the Hitch-hiker's pentalogy. Even better than the first, and the others are on a downward spiral. But this is a maelstrom of inventions, of masterful marvelous satire, ranging from the Absurd, the outright demential and the satyrical. Almost every sentence will make you laugh, and the best of them will make you think! My favourite episodes? Zaphod's irritable personality at odds whit an emotive insect, an acrophobic elevator, a soul divorced from its body and the demented captain of an intergalactic ship waiting for lemon-soaked napkins! Then you have Millyway's Dinner, the Science Fiction answer to Petronius'Coena Trimalchionis, and later, after the encounter whit the man who rules(?) the Universe, the absurd fate of Ark B! Oh,we'll miss Douglas Adams! He was truly unique."
4,Poor Marvin,"I understand why my dear friend, Marvin is so depressed. No one cares about him! They forget him for millions of years or ask him to sacrifice himself for so they can live. It's all rather depressing. Being a robot is no reason to take him for granted. As he has clearly expressed, he has feelings too.That said, I'm thrilled that I am a vegetarian. The idea of your dinner coming to talk you made me ill. I don't care if the meat wants to be cooked, it's just another example of humans trying not to feel guilty for torturing animals.Rants aside, I am enjoying this series. Mr. Adams dry wit and humor continue to amaze me."
4,very funny book,"I have just been introduced to Douglas Adams, and as I read his first book, The Hitchikers Guide To the Galaxy, I didn't totally understand his humor, but then I finally caught on and I don't think I ever laughed so hard, my cheeks started to get sore from smiling and laughing. theres absolutely nothing serious about the book, its not like some parts are serious during the story and some are just funny, the whole book has a story to it and its one funny page after another. If your looking for a funny book then pick up any Douglas Adams book, you don't have to read them in order if you wanted to know but its always nice to do that."
4,time travel and tomfoolery,"Irreverent. Laugh out loud funny. High concept? This tale picks up after the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and in many ways is the stronger of the two. Adams was ahead of his time with these books and I can see why he amassed such a devoted following.Oh how the residents of Fintlewoodlewix resemble Americans.The poor Belcerebon's cursed with telepathy, once enlightened now forced to talk very loudly and continuously about the banal.And who can forget the Editors of the Guide's defense that ""beauty was truth, truth beauty"" and that ..""the guilty party in this case was Life itself for failing to be either beautiful or true.""I recommend anyone with a sense of humor that hasn't spent an afternoon with the Hitchhiker's Guide or the Restaurant at the End of the Universe to go ahead and do so...time travel and tomfoolery in the hands of a satiric master."
4,stand-up comedy to challenge the mind,"Intolerably funny. But if you thought you could get away with Douglas Adams without thinking about the Big Questions in life, no such luck! While putting mortality 2 million years out is a great way to soften the blow, the question is still, ""OK, you got a life for a little while, whatta ya gonna do about it?"""
5,Hilarious!,"Among the best books I've read. A worthy sequel to A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The ideas Douglas Adams has are ridiculously ingenious. I highly recomend this book, but read the first one first."
1,Waste of time and money,"This book will tell you absolutely nothing you can't learn for free by reading the eBay tutorials and looking at couple of sports card message boards (beckett, sportscardsheriff, etc).The information presented is of the most basic nature and is repeated many times, often on the same page. It became quite obvious after reading the first two chapters that the author was struggling to ""pad"" the page count of this book.I am not an expert in sports collecting by any means, in fact I just started this year. However, if you just follow the advice in my first paragraph, you will have acquired the knowledge in this book many times over.If you're still not convinced, go to your local bookstore and flip through this book, you'll see what I mean fairly quickly."
5,RIP-ROARING ROCK 'N ROLL,"""Fly"" is a great outtake from the ""America's Sweetheart"" sessions and ""Mono"" is the lead-off track that kicks in with a fury I would think UNDENIABLE to anyone who loves hard rock. Courtney really IS the queen of noise, and her instincts with melody, chord changes, and lyrics is remarkable."
1,"Courtney, please go home...","I don't own this particular CD single, but I bought her full length CD when it came out. I also recently purchased Melissa Auf der Maur's debut solo album too, which doesn't hit stateside until May. For those of you out there keeping score:Melissa: 10 Courtney: zip, nada....I don't know. I think Courtney's going thru some bad stuff right now, especially after last week's episodes.Get some help, NOW honey...HOLE this ain't.Buyers beware."
5,This book cooks!,"I'm not a great cook but I thought I knew how to make nachos. Boy, was I wrong! The recipes in this book take nachos to levels I never dreamed of. Now I can make them not just as a snack but as a full meal. Even my girlfriend wonders where I suddenly learned how to cook.If you want to salivate, buy this book just for the photos."
5,Muncha Macho Nacho,"What a fun, handy, and useful book! Piled to the brim with lucious, delectable, and creatively appetizing recipes that elevate the common nacho to unequaled gastronomical heights, ""Macho Nachos"" is as witty as it is full of useful ideas. For less than the cost of a bag of nachos, you can discover how to prepare toothsome nacho-based meals and munchies to satiate hungry family and guests, anytime from game nights to opening galas at the opera."
4,great chorus pedal,"This is a great chorus pedal, except the expensive out-weighs the greatness.EH pedals need to bring their prices down a tadother than that an awesome pedal.I play bass through it and it works great.So really great for whatever instrument you want to run through it. Many knob configuration can also let you get some weird sounds out of it."
3,I think my unit is defective...,"I've always looked up to EH when it came to extreme guitar effects. Their pedals are about the only ones thatallow of extreme settings, even when they aren't musical. Their engineers let the player have full power overthe sound. It is fantastic, because the effects range from classic to dramatic, and even unique.Unfortunatelly, I'm too far away for a return, or to ship it for factory repairs. Everything works great, exceptthe When using the double track mode. In order to obtain that ""rodeo arena"" sound, I must set the tune/delayknob past half. With lenghtier delays, the sound is invaded by a a high pitched whistle, like the sound madeby a camera flash charging. It is so annoying that is impossible to use the pedal at this settings, and they'renot extreme or experimental: The pedal should work well in this range.I just don't know if my pedal is working as it should, or if it is defective. Anyway, i'm not completely happywith the product."
1,Poor Quality construction,"I did a lot of research before buying my pogoripflash pro2 and based on the praise it had received it seemed like a good idea to pick one up. It seemed to work fairly well for the first couple months, but after about 4 months or so, the headphone jack started acting a little strange. It wouldn't always carry a stereo signal so I figured maybe the contact points needed addressing. I tried other sets of headphones and all had the same problem. I really was not rough on the device and really rarely used the headphone jack as I used it mostly to record lectures and then dump them right onto my computer. There's no reason a headphone jack should go bad in that amount of time. I should also add to my list of gripes the fact that the user interface is not intuitive. Hope this helps someone!"
3,"Good product, but","1. I can't understand why the name of buttons are at the bottom of the product. When you want to know what a button os for, you need to turn the player. Annoying.2. Good sound but not strong enough. When I walk down the street in New York, I need to turn the volume to max, and I still can hardly hear the music.3. Battery life is good."
1,Stay away please,"This company is very very unprofessional. The unit looks cool and has great functions. The problem is that it breaks easily and the company has terrible tech/customer support. This unit has had a lot of complaints, do yourself a favor and go with a different company. I did."
3,Not quite what I expected.,Not as good as I hoped. I was looking for more of a Doo Wop sound. A couple of good songs however.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK,"This was a COMPLETELY worthless product. I bought it to slice limes for a party...they might as well call in a juicer. It just smashed the limes. I even tried cutting the ends off my limes, thinking that it might be too hard of an edge....it didn't help. It just isn't sharp enough. Don't waste your money."
4,very complete,"excellent book with lots of info, some i never even thought i would find! as good as expected after reading her first book, baby love.enjoyhend"
2,Disappointed by bias,"I found this book somewhat useful, in that it has a run down of development milestones which is what I was after in reading it, but overall disappointing.The fact that Barker says it is fine to stop breastfeeding at 9 months if you want to, despite that fact that Australian, American and the World Health Organisation's standards all recommend breasfeeding until *at least* 12 months concerned me. While there are acceptable alternatives for those who cannot breastfeed for whatever reason, her 'expert' view that to stop at 9 months is 'fine' seems misleading.Additionally, although she presents various options for managing issues such as night waking, it is clear where her bias lies (controlled crying) and she does not present any of the advantages of other systems.Basically, this book presents itself as being balanced and giving you options, but in my opinion the 'balance' is very one sided.I will not be purchasing or recommending this book."
3,"Not a girl, not yet a woman...","Ciara's return with ""The Evolution"" has garnered her comparisons to Janet Jackson, Prince, among others. While I admit her dancing is phenomenal, her singing and songwriting talents leave much to the imagination. I bought this cd on the strength of the song ""Promise"" which I find innovative, if only for the production by Palow da Don. The rest of the cd leaves me lacking to find Ciara as a person, as a songwriter, even as a woman. She guards herself too much, almost self-censorship and I feel it hurts her material. One exception: ""Just Like A Boy"" is an intriguing spin on the male vs. female relationship spectrum. I feel what she is singing, and can relate to this song. Nevermind, the scripted spoken - word interludes. Fake and contrived. Once Ciara becomes more ""real"", I will recommend her music."
3,An improvement over the first but she yes yet to evolve into a diva,"Ciara: The Evolution is a slight improvement over her first CD. Granted the child still can't SANG but she is a performer like Janet & Aaliyah before here. The lead single Promise has really grown on me and has a early Vanity/Appoliana 6 feel to it (the video is proof this statement). With the exception of ""Promise,"" The Evolution lacks clear-cut highlights on the level of ""Goodies,"" ""1, 2 Step,"" and ""Oh from her first album. Ciara must have been trying to show her growth as artist but she fails for the most part. Other than Promise, Can't Leave Em Alone and I Found Myself there isn't really to much mentoin."
4,A New And Better Ciara,"This was a great second coming by Ciara. You can really tell that she has grown and matured as an artist. With the exception of ""Promise"", all the songs fit her vocals and style perfectly. The cd has some nice beats and the topics are very relateable.All of them are topics that people have delt with in relationships at one time or another. My only complaint would be the skits. I don't think those were necessary b/c they added nothing to the album. Overall though, this is one of the best female R&B cds out. Stand Out Songs: Like A Boy, Thats Right, Just Me, My Love"
4,HIGH ENERGY,"I gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She lovessssss it. I can appreciate her youthful 21 year old spirit and honesty ( ""I'm just Me""...love it) Some compare her to Janet Jackson...I say, let'senjoy the freshy feel Ciarra has to bring on its own."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I'm still a fan of Ciara's, but this album doesn't live up to the hype of the first one. The lyrics seems to be a little more adult, but her beats have lost somewhat of that 'crunk' appeal which was featured in her first album. I'm guessing she just wanted to slow things down and show she has a singing voice, which she has a decent voice. As a recommendation to a future buyer, unless you're a huge fan of hers don't buy this album.Here are the tracks I was feeling:~Get Up~Make It Last Forever~I'm Just Me~Promise~Get In, Fit In~I Found Myself~Like a Boy"
2,Whoa! save your money,"This CD is for people who like to dance all the time, I only liked two songs on it and those were the songs that came our before the cd was released. Ciara this is not an evolution, the first cd was better, another sophomore flop"
2,First album was better,"Ciara calls herself the Princess of Crunk so that is what she should stick to. Promise is a good song, but not for someone with limited singing ability. The first few songs are good, but I wasn't feeling the rest of the cd that much. Maybe she shouldn't have went back to the 80's."
2,just ok,Ciara is a ok vocalist at best on a good day. what makes some of these tracks work is the Production&the Sounds. this Album has a 80's influence which clearly channels a Janet Jacksonesque vibe through out. the album has a blend of dance tracks&slow cuts. Ciara though is more closer to Ashanti in terms of where she is. catchy dance pop which usually means that a newbie will come along&take over what Ciara is doing. basically a Producer's Act which as long as she can stay in her music lane she will be aight.
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!! 2.5 STARS!!!,"I'm sorry but this album was not good AT ALL! Okay maybe i shouldnt say at all but it was far from what I expected from the ""Princess"". Ciara is on some other sheit and change isnt always good.Let me start off with the tracks I thought were hot!!-Like A Boy(#2) is a good track, it's definitely something us girls canrelate to.-Promise (#4) of course this track is bangin! I must say in the song andvideo she has really grown from a cute teen to a sexy woman.-Cant Leave Him Alone feat.50 cent(#6) is good, but it took about threetimes of me hearing it to like it. Im really getting boredwit 50 and his ""never-changing"" flow. He always sound the same.-My Love(#8) another song to relate to.Some songs were ok (""Thats Rite"", ""C.R.U.S.H."", ""Get Up"") but other than that, I will keep her first album ""Goodies"" in constant rotation because I really dont see much evolving on this album. Ciara is my girl and I really hope on her next album she come wit it again!"
3,Ciara Continues,"The queen of the quick-to-evaporate ""crunk"" genre is back in an attempt to reclaim her throne. Although the title of the album signals a sense of maturity, she is still sticking to what made her. Dance loop and club hooks evade from the opening track ""That's Right"" to even the second single, ""Promises,"" which is a slow number but with a groovy beat.Yet, including the singles, nothing stands out from the other tracks. This creates a plateau on the album that rarely waivers. Moreover, the interludes exude unhealthy amounts of pretense, that optimum enjoyment of this record requires a re-burn without them.This effort is easily digestable with tracks so easily accessable like ""Like A Boy"" and ""Get In, Fit In,"" but that is all that can be said to its withering quality."
3,Same Old Same Old,"Get Up, the first single sounds just like One, Two Step, and the video looks like Janet Jackson. That's Right, the albums leadoff single, sounds just like Missy Elliot's Lose Control.Besides that, it's a good listen, and she's hot and a great dancer, but just not an original artist. I guess Evolve should really mean Morph. Morph into 2006's version of Janet Jackson. Sorry for being so critical. But who needs good reviews anyway."
4,Ciara: The Evolution,"Good CD. Maybe Goodies has a slight edge, but it's just that, slight. Ciara has grown in this album and I love the fact that she has joined MJB, Beyoncé and Heather Headley in letting society know that whatever you do (men) we can too... Like a boy is a great example of how society has different standards when it comes to men & women. Promise is a great song (we need more ""real"" love songs). And we won't even talk about the fact that there are great dance tracks. I love the fact that she is our next Janet Jackson. For me, she is a great dancer, alright singer and that makes for great years of entertainment as we had from JJ. I love this young lady. KEEP IT UP CiCi..."
4,Descent,"3.5 stars. Since I'm always on the prowl for good music to workout to, I thought this CD would be a nice addition to help me NOT watch the clock on the treadmill. It was and it wasn't. I don't know anyting about this Queen of Crunk, since there isn't a Crunk billboard, but whateva. On this Cd, there's no one song that makes me want to hit the replay button and it isn't one of those CDs that stay in your head after you listen. It's not bad, it's not great. However, there are a couple of songs just shy of being really good. So congratulations Ciara for not buckling under the sophomore curse, but you're really going have to bring it on your third CD."
3,It is okay?,"Some of the songs are good like C.R.U.S.H, Get Up, That's right,I proceed,and Bang It Up."
4,Did her best,"Ciara has put the icing on the cake with her single ""Promise"". After I heard that and saw the video i couldnt wait for the release date. I was a little disappointed when i heard her CD, because she has alot of techno beats, but after i sat and listened to the songs they are actually good. I love number 8. The one with 50 is tight. I give her props, because she well deserves them......."
4,Feels so good...,"I am not exactly into the new music spewing out the radio these days, but thanks to the sexy cover on Ciara's album, curiousity got the better of me. While the first song had me reaching for volume control, the high energy of the song had me moving my feet, yeah this is hot club music! By the time I was on the track ""I Proceed"", Ciara had won me over. Her vocals reminds me of Toni Braxton but with a sexy twist to it. Love the music...its great for dancing up a storm!"
3,it's ok,"There are 3 or 4 good songs on this album, but the rest are just so so. The bonus DVD doesn't include full routines, but it's pretty good."
1,"wow, this CD got a lot of hype but it wasn't worth it!","I liked the singles get up and promise and her dancing was fabulous in it, very much like janet jackson so of course I expected ciara to have gone all out, but I listened to the album and I just couldn't get into it at all. I love r&b and I love freestyle music, both of which ciara sings but it's so bland and boring I couldn't get into it at all. I have tons of friends who were gushing about the album, and I even had to hear it over and over again at a hip hop dance class I took so I thought it would grow on me for sure but it just annoyed me and is already forgotten about. Ciara is a good dancer and has the looks but that's it. She's all hype and without any substance."
4,The Evolution,"Artists seem to worship the word ""Evolution"" as it not only appears to be the title of Ciara's new album but also Robin Thicke's latest album. Ciara's ""Evolution"" is like Janet Jackson's ""Rhythm Nation"". It is somewhat formatted like the classic 1989 album. Ciara, clearly influenced by Jackson has done what she does best..make dance music. Dance music that goes hard with vocals that are easy on the ears. Ciara's obvious influence, Jackson can be recalled on the breezy Rodney Jerkins produced, Make It Last Forever. The song is one of the albums many highlights. The hook and melody is pure pop perfection. I could see this as a future single. Unlike Jackson, Ciara doesn't stick to just one in-house producer as she did with her previous album, Goodies. Ciara hauls in big name producers such as the aforementioned Jerkins, The Neptunes, will-i-am, and Sean Garrett to name a few. All of this makes for one of the more enjoyable discs of 2006.Personal Highlights include:Tracks 4-18*****"
3,She's grown....But it could've been better,"I'm not going to totally discredit Ciara because i do see growth in her music. Her last album was more fun songs not taking life too seriously but you do see her talking about more situations but i do think the notably absent mentor, Jazze Pha effects this album in a negative way. Everyone can't stand too far out without having any faults. Only some artist can do that and get away with it(Kelis), so Ciara you can experiement but don't go too far from where you started.p.s. If you're looking for a sequel to ""Goodies"", this isn't the album for you."
5,She Kills It,What is really good with the Ciara haters. She has stepped her game up and stuck to what she knows. Her sophmore album is just as solid as her first. Working with different producers really worked in her favor too. She is growing and can't be stopped.
2,Not my cup of tea,"Pros: I think Ciara is an excellent performer and dancer. I'd go see her live and always enjoy her stage presence. I like her song with Chamillionaire a lot; it's good from start to finish. I also like how in her new video, she shows off her hair length. I think it's cool when women embrace their OWN natural attributes. I thought ""So Hard"" had a really nice beat that I could dance to.Cons: I was not into this cd at all. It was medium all the way through. Even the dance tracks were just ""okay."" The song where she talks about how ghetto she is was absolutely annoying, and just embraced the stereotypes that mainstream media already loves to glorify. Minus the song with Chamillionaire and ""So Hard,"" I listened to this cd completely confused. The lyrics were amateurish and the beats weren't nearly as exciting as her last cd. I'd still buy her next cd in hopes that it would be better though and balance out the two."
1,evolotion of what,never liked ciara she's cute but not much of a singer she's best known as a p popper.
5,give credit where credit is due,"I love this cd, mostly everybody I knows says that Ciara tries to act like Aaliyah, is she trying to act like Aaliyah or maybe she just happens to like the same type of singing and dancing style. My opinion, Ciara is a much better singer and dancer, Ciara has the kind of voice that can sing any type of song or style, Aaliyah did not have that kind of voice. If Aaliyah were still here would anybody says that Ciara is trying to act like her, give credit where credit is due?"
4,Keep it Bumpin',"Ciara is as hot as the city she represents on this CD. With Lil Jon on the first song, you know this CD is gonna be crunk. The songs flow well and Ciara knows how to connect to her audience. This is the next stage for Ciara and is in my opinion the natural evolution from Goodies to real issues. I personally don't like interludes but they are short and I can handle it. If you like the Atlanta crunk sound, pick up this CD."
3,Just OK,"Despite being hyped as a major revolution, Ciara's new full-length CD is just OK. A reviewer below said it best - mostly studio produced stuff. The vocals are OK. Many of the songs have hooks, but many others don't, and they are interrupted by interludes...sounds like a Janet Jackson album to me. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Its just that one would have to have expected so much more from her this time out. There is nothing on this record that is as edgy or as catchy as ""My Goodies,"" however that song was helped tremendously by Petey Pablo, who is an underrated performer despite his limitations. Some of the beats here are new, but some sound like they were recorded in 1993, particularly the ones engineered by Darkchild. There's nothing wrong with this CD, and it was worth the price. It's just nowhere near as good as it could...or should have been. Not bad, but certainly not an evolution."
2,HM Blog Review,"[...]Brace yourself, because the second you put the CD in, Ci Ci gets crunk. This is not a chill in the crib or cruise down Sunset cd...This cd is more like something you get a good workout to. Vocally, she sounds better on this cd than she did on her debut album, but her songs certainly aren't better. She may have been a bit premature in calling this cd an evolution, since it's more like a throwback. A majority of the tracks have a very 90's Ghost Town DJs, borderline techno/house sound. She would've been much better off sticking with the sound of her first single, Promise. Promise is hands down one of the best songs on the album, if not the best. Other highlights are Can't Leave Em Alone (in spite of 50 Cent) and C.R.U.S.H. Overall, her cd is very redundant, she doesn't really show much depth or range of emotions, and all of the up-tempo songs become overkill."
1,lovetobakebutnowithMarthaDay,"Review from Mrs. Weiss: I have tried several recipes from this book and time and again I have been disappointed with the whole thing from start to finish. For the pie crust recipe the dough was too sticky to roll out or stretch. It also didn't make enough dough for the pie. Another example is when I tried to make the chocolate chip cookies - should have been very easy - but the cookies turned out to be ""cookie chips"". The cookies spread out flat like crepes and toasted to where when I tried to get them off the pan they broke into chips. Sooooo... I have finally given up on this book and I'm just going to give it to a thrift store :( It's just not worth waisting more food."
2,Average Results,"This recipe book really drew me in with the fabulous pictures of so many desserts. But, I have tried a few recipes and was dissappointed with the results. The blueberry muffins were bland, and the snickerdoodles (cinnamon biscuits) were hard. I have been baking for 20 years, and my desserts are usually crowd pleasers. Not the case when I used the recipes in this book. Since it was published in London, some of the the weights are measured in ounces and grams, which is totally inconvenient. Also, there is no conversion table in the book. The two stars are for the great pictures. Make no mistake, this is written by Martha Day NOT Stewart!"
5,Child of The 70's,"What can I say, I owned this record when I was a kid. I recommend tjis for any CD collection especially if you love 70's music. It has a very layed back sound."
5,What is not to like?,"I got introduced to Ambrosia back during the ""Life beyond LA"" years and was very taken with both the lyrics and musicality of this band. Creative and very nice to listen to. I often find myself going back to listen to them again and again. Still enjoy & hope you do too?"
5,Slaughter in the Ashes,Very pleased with the speed of delivery. The books are all in excellent shape. I discovered the Ashes series and William W. Johnstone as a writer. He is awesome. To think that he wrote these books over 15 years ago and you can just look at todayand see all of us right there. Should be manditory reading for Juniors and Seniors in High School. Might help to teach them to be thankful for what they have and to wake up and take some pride in the country and responsibility for their own actions.I am on book 16 of the series and can't wait to finish them
5,fantastic plant stand,"I just received this today and I am very impressed with it. The stand is sturdy and does not wobble. It can hold pots sized 4 inches across at their base and the stand does not take up a lot of space on my outdoor deck. I've been searching for good plant stands at all the ""big hardware"" stores and nothing was sturdy enough or had the value this one does!"
4,"Is very simple and soft, but no strong","I to buy this bag becouse I want to protect my nikon camera coolpix P2, This bag is good and simple, but is no very strong and no for continue use."
4,look alike OEM part,It fits like oem partit looks like original OEM part. thougth quality could be better.to anybody who wants to get parts that fit and look as a OEM part at low price
5,Great Deal,"I ordered this mirror for my 2002 Saturn SL2. The price was very competitive. It arrived quickly. It was well packed. The old one slipped out, and the new one slipped in easily with 3 10mm bolts. The new power mirror is working perfectly. I'd call this a great deal, and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a mirror of this type."
2,Good Product For The Price...Not After A Year,"My husband is hard of hearing. I have set his handset at the high volume and he can now talk to his family and hear them (the ""hard of hearing"" phone doesn't work this well).It is easy to program.We like having 20 memory entries...it covers both famiies and friends. We like having our own handsets.He can clip his to his pocket and take it where ever he wants to go and I can use the paging system to alert him. I am still waiting to hear what the composition of the key pad is due to allergy issues.2011 update: have gone through 3 sets of expensive batteries and the phones are worthless. I am looking to replace them now as the sound has diminished greatly."
4,como cada disco de victor manuel,"como cada disco de victor manuel, este disco esta lleno de buenas canciones, tiene varias que son muy especiales, tiene sons, y varias baladas, la cancion ""con un poco de ti"" tiene ritmo y sabor, mientras que la cancion , ""dama del alba"" te pone a pensar en esa nefasta enfermedad que esta afectando a tantas personas en estos tiempos, el sida. le recomiendo este disco a todos, es muy bueno"
4,Great Product,"Worked great with my craftsman air compressor. It's seems to be made solid, great product, would recommend if you need to split your air."
4,too much cough syrup can be a good thing,"this is the sound of:walking down a dirt road. a dry, dry dusty dirt road. there is no water to drink. it is august and hotter than august should be. and dry. you swallow and it hurts. you sweat and your head hurts. the dry heat pounds.so you find this old 45rpm record at the side of the road. in the dust. the dry dry dust.you take the 45 with you and you come home and go inside your shack. you put the 45 on your turntable. maybe not all the dust is blown off the record. but your turntable is broken and only plays back the 45 at 16rpm, maybe 33rpm now and again.that is the sound of this Houndog record, and I love it. love it dry like that"
3,Side Project or Side Show?,"Houndog is a side project of David Hidalgo and Mike Halby consisting of all but one original tune. The CD has a distinct, slow motion quality to the sound with vocals often reminiscent of Tom Waits on Quaaludes. Whatever the duo sought to accomplish, it certainly was not to demonstrate their musical talents. Nevertheless, there are some relatively good songs here. In fact, arguably the two best tracks, ""No Change"" and ""I Brought The Rain"" were both covered by John Hammond in a little more tolerable fashion in his latest release, ""Ready For Love"". I would have liked to have heard this CD in its original form, before the engineer decided to slow it up on the playback. Interesting stuff."
4,DEF comedy JAM at its best,"If you liked the DEF Comedy JAM series, you will love this movie as many of the comedians from DEF Comedy appear in this film. Very Funny. Above all else, if the critics say it is bad then you know it must be a great movie."
1,Value our children and refuse to lower their expectations,"I watched this film years ago, and even laughed a little. Now I think about the messages that he's teaching our young children, and it upsets me. I belive Martin is a talented comedian, but I refuse to believe that this is the best way for him to express himself. This is my ""OPINION"""
5,great,Just an amazing item and would recommend this to anyone and the service was great as can be! Just awesome!
3,A Disappointing Knock-Off,"Having watched and loved Nunsense, I was prepared to enjoy Nunsense 2. Although there is a ton of talent onstage, the total effect is lightweight. I kept waiting for this video to get to the good part, but that never happened. I wish it had."
4,great video shots but questionable ratings,"I loved the game footage on this DVD. However, I had a problem with some of the QB ratings. I wholeheartedly agree with Joe Montana being the undisputed number 1 quarterback. Where I disagree with the ratings is when they rank non-Superbowl winning QBs such as Dan Marino and Jim Kelly so high. I simply can't believe Dan Marino is ranked ahead of Terry Bradshaw! This is pure foolishness. Otherwise, a nice NFL films product."
4,IRON MAIDEN'S FANS MUST HAVE BOOKS,"If you are a hardcore Maiden fan like me,Get The Books,you fans won't regret it.The best of Steve,Dave,Adrian,Bruce,and ofcourse Nico.Trust me this toy is not one you would get tired of."
5,"Of course, he's angry","This is a great book by a very angry man. The world has turned horrible as we have watched, and Bywater tells us some, only some, of the ways in which this horror has been foisted on us. Many of the essays are very funny ..... and then not so funny. He has seen the absurdity of life and has now told us about it. Anyone who is satisfied with the modern world and does not feel that much has been lost will hate this book. Anyone without a sense of humor will hate this book. Anyone incapable of feeling outrage at what ""they"" (and we all know who they are!) have done to us will hate this book. Anyone lacking a soul will hate this book. Anyone who thinks that the government/the corportions/the people across the street have our best interests at heart will hate this book. Anyone who thinks he will live forever will hate this book. I love it.At first and to a shallow mind the essays seem random and unfocused, but gradually the theme emerges: we've been had."
3,Not what I expected.,"From the review from publisher I had expected any number of things. What I got was essentially a comedy novel along the lines of the Devil's Dictionary. With entries like: Absurdity, Gloves, and Patchouli(which I disagree with I think the author just needs to go find a hippie and he'll find his patchouli). While it's good for what it is I was hoping for something a little more serious."
1,Its not what it says on the Tin(ask an English if confused),Failed the first chapter test...irritating chattering classes book that no doubt enables amusing dinner party conversations...clearly I am too common to appreciate its wit...sigh back to the scullery where I belong
1,Was expecting Better,"The guys are good, but don't get this collection. Choose a better one. Nothing on the disc, except ""She's My Girl"", is stereo. Shame on Rhino - who is usually excellent. The tracks are clean. But an awesome stereo version of ""I Fought The Law"" exists. I suspect one does also for ""Let Her Dance"" - the two main tracks for which I purchased this. To find they are in MONO is disappointing. If anybody can recommend the collection that has these two tracks, specifically, in STEREO, please share that info. Thanks."
5,Best Horse Ever,"I bought this horse for my horse loving little girl when she was 5. Ranger has been through it all, and he definitely shows signs of being well-loved, but he remains her favorite of a collection of 200+ other stuffed horses. Ranger is well made, holds up to being tossed like a basketball, can survive time-out, and is very huggable. Great product."
4,delivers,"I mounted this thing to a Craftsman 12-inch bandsaw, even though it's supposed to be installed on a 14-inch. I had to drill a couple of holes in the side of the saw table. It was a snap to mount and true up. When the fence is tightened for use, I believe you could swing on the fence without moving it out of place. Great product."
3,Not Meet Expectations,"This fence is the best rated of them all, that is what led me to purchase it even though I was a bit skeptical. The fence only anchors on one side, but so does a Biesmeyer fence, and that fence is rock solid. However the Kreg fence will flex since it made of aluminum, and this causes blade drift if you are resawing heavy timbers. I am going to scrap it in favor of a fence that secures on both ends.rgds"
4,Band saw fence,"Most original band saw fences are lousy at best, unless you buy more expensive saws. This is definitely a great improvement over my original Delta 14"" band saw fence which came with the saw. It was easy to install and it works fine for what it is designed to do. Be prepared for a lot of adjustments to get it almost perfect though."
4,A step in the right direction.,"This fence didn't fit on my 18"" delta band saw. I would be nice if the product literature would mention that.The quality of some of the materials was disappointing. Kreg could at least have used stainless steel bolts and screws, and sturdier knobs.The adjustment mechanism for drift was not as easy to use as it could be. One could make a drift fence in about the same time as it takes to adjust the fence.The microadjuster would have a better feel if it was constructed of higher grade materials.I give Kreg 4 stars for making an effort.3 stars for the quality of the product."
2,"Doesn't Fit Craftsman 14"" Bandsaw Without Drilling","I visited Kregs website to see the compatibility chart for mounting this to my new Craftsman 14"" bandsaw. The chart showed that it could be mounted without drilling, but would require removal for blade changes. There are no mounting holes pre-drilled on the table where this needs to mount. I don't want to take a chance on damaging my new bandsaw table so this unit is being returned."
5,Kreg band saw fence review,Great Fence! My only complaint is. Nothing was mentioned in the add about tape coming with the fence.Not wanting to reorder. Just to get the tape. So I ordered the tape. A waste of money. I know it is shonein the photo. But I have ordered in the past. ( I should say Not with Amazon.) And be told thats only for the photo.
4,IT IS A NICE FENCE FOR MY BANDSAW,"It felt weird not having a back end to clamp onto the table but it does work and stays solid. Much better than the factory fence for my Jet bandsaw. The gravity held lever made it a real pain for fine adjustments. I also bought the fine adjuster and even though it may be a bit gimmicky, it does do what it is supposed to do and gets the fence where I want it."
5,Sturdy and convenient,I used to attach a piece of wood as a fence using a couple of clamps. When I saw this fence I was not sure how sturdy it was going to be since it is only attached on one end but it is very sturdy. It's so easy to set it up and to slide it out of the way when you don't need it. No more trying to set up the piece of wood parallel to the blade for me :-) I love this fence!
4,nice fence,"The only ""issue"" I had with this item is that the fence is available only in a length to fit a ""standard"" bandsaw table. As my 30"" wide table is considerably larger than the standard, I had to order a separate 48"" length of fence material to replace the standard length fence. Would be nice if the unit could be ordered with the 48"" fence in place of the standard 18"" rather than having to purchase the 48"" length fence material in addition to the standard. The mounting rail fits on the left side of the table, the design assumes that the blade slot comes through the front edge of the table. As the blade slot on my saw comes through the left edge of the table, I had to mount the mounting rail on the right side of the table which is a bit unusual but gets around that problem. The alternative would have been to cut the mounting rail into two pieces, and mount one section to the left and one to the right of the blade slot"
3,Good album could have been better,this is more like a 3.5 star release there are mostly good tracks and then there are some tracks that are just plain bad lyricly this touches on many topics mostly political and is closer to LMNOs Economic Food Chain Music with the lyrics. On past efforts the production was handled by dj rhettmatic but its good to see that all of the visionaries are involved on this one I enjoyed some of the tracks on this CD such as Cant Say Love and a few others. if you are a fan I would deffinitely recomend this. otherwise I would say start with the World famous Beat Junkie series and work your way up from there. this was an above average album but I would not go as far as to say it was great.3 and a half mics.

I was swept off my feet while listening to this one for the first time and the CD has been on heavy rotation ever since. Some samples sound a wee bit too familiar though (the one in ""6 Ring Circus"" has been used by the German DJ Roey Marquis II 4-5 years ago, hehe) but all after all, tight production and lyrics aren't an issue with MCs like LMNO in your team. :)"
2,What is the purpose of this book?,"Besides for being a long ad for Sonia's products and a photo album of her friends, the is nothing I didn't know before. A makeup artist writing a book about beauty without showing even one ""how-to""? No tips?And the CD jammed my computer, so I cannot review it!DISAPPOINTING."
2,"All photos, not much substance","Much like so many other books out there, it's a lot of beautiful photos but no illustration on techniques or charts. It seems like there is a ocean of makeup coffee table books aout there but hardly any true 'how-to"" books."
1,Not at all like it was decribed..,This book is written by Sonia on how great Sonia is. If you are looking for a step by step instruction on how to do your makeup...this is not the book for you.
4,NOT Blowing Smoke,"I paid the $250 dollars, after searching for this movie for years, and it was money well spent. I find the movie brilliant. Possibly this is because I lived in Southern California during the cigar craze. I enjoyed the craze, but didn't like the fact that cigar prices were inflated. I've spent time with guys as depicted in the movie, at Friday after-work smokers, sponsored by Dunhill located in an upscale mall. Of course cigars were also great in seedy bars, before the smoking ban went into effect. The movie isn't a blockbuster, but for my personal nostalgia, it is a winner.Patrick shouldn't have been such a pessimist. I managed to get the widescreen, unrated version."
4,Great way to quiz yourself,I bought this book for my medical school psychiatry rotation. This book alone is not one that I would suggest to prepare for the shelf exam. This is a book I would use after you have already studied and you want to quiz yourself to see if you can recognize the diagnosis.I would use the First-Aid Psychiatry Clerkship Manual and Pre-test Psychiatry Question book instead. I felt those helped me get a great shelf exam score and I also used them to prepare for Step 2 boards.
2,Go with something else,"Although this does the trick (it charges the NiMH batteries), I've used much nicer products that are really not much more expensive.The charger is not ""rapid"" by any means. It takes more than 10 hours to charge fully. Also, the batteries have to be positioned 'just right' to get the charge lights to stay on. AAA batteries are even harder to get right. Another problem is that batteries much be charged in pairs. Overall, I much prefer the other offerings like the Lenmar Mach 1 charger. Spend the extra money."
5,vision of the fool ii,Jr has a wonderful soulful sound. it doesn't really fit in any catagory she has made her own and it is delightful. her music fills me we passion. Veretta
5,Teacher Touts Book!,"I use this book in my 6th grade class in NM. It's a great example of a bi-lingual book that focuses on stories from the Hispanic culture. What child has no grown up with stories of the ""bogey man"" in any language? You can pair ELL students up with a ELO student and share reading. It's great for Peer Support teams also."
5,El cucuy - loved it!,Loved these series of books - I had a hard time finding Mexican folktale books at the traditional bookstores and this book was exactly what I needed. The fact that it's bilingual was a huge plus since my kids are not that fluent in Spanish yet. They really enjoy reading about some of the stories I grew up hearing.
4,Not a bootleg,"The review by Bob Hund is not correct. This collection contains versions of tracks not found on Trojan releases. Some of them are superior, some of them not so. But if you must have everything Bob released, you won't be disappointed with this CD. Do a search on the usenet (rec.music.reggae) for postings concerning this CD."
5,Worth the Money!,"Yes...it's a little pricey. But, I don't think I will be needing to replace it anytime soon. I have the switch panel powered from a BlueSea power/ground buss. I ran all my accessories with a hot wire to the switch panel and the ground to the buss. I have the LED backlights set up to turn on with the ignition switch. Each switch is individually protected....no ""two switches on one fuse"" like many other switch panels. So far, this thing has been holding up and working stellar! Looks awesome on my rig. Right now, I have four of the six switches in use. Shortly, the other two will be taken up, also. The switch came with a large selection of decals to put in the switch ID locations. You should not have any choice finding the ones you need."
3,Classic TV - The Fu Manchu Series from 1956,"Four episodes from the original 1956 TV Series is in BW and unclear in certain frames, but overall a very good transfer with good story lines. Episodes include 1) The Golden Egg of Dr Fu Manchu (henchmen sent to kill wife), 2) The Master Plan (revives Hitler), 3) The Death Ships (deadly germ cultures), 4) The Prisoner of Dr Fu Manchu (deadly serum at the Conference of Nations)."
4,the TV FU Manchu,"1st, outstanding service and great product, exactly as described.2nd., amazing piece of early TV history and a welcome edition to my Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee interpretations of this wonderful pulp character."
1,Not as shown,"The case I received is NOT the case shown. The one I received was made of really thin, cheap blue plastic. It would provide no protection. It also had the label ""Remington"" on it. It is a complete rip-off, and a waste of money."
1,"A half star, or no stars at all, if possible","I cannot believe that this speculative, didacticrant has received all 5 stars. If you want to knowand understand Virginia Woolf, read Hermione Lee'sgreat (and definitive) biography. Period."
3,"A Decent Book, Must Have Interest in Acting","Although this book is a vast collection of writings, it serves a relatively narrow interest for anyone who does not have a direct interest in the theater. It's been useful to me in that I've read two chapters for my acting class (which was taken simply to fulfill a requirement), and I was able to complete a very well-informed and organized report based on what I read in the book. However, I do not see myself using this book in the future except as perhaps a reference book when I'm asked about one particular famous actor/actress or another. But then, I could also buy the Encyclopaedia BritannicaBritannica Encyclopedia (Encyclopaedia)and get a quick reference instead of several pages of things that I will not really care about again in the foreseeable future. Cost, however, prevents me from doing so."
2,21st Century NFL Follies not what I had hoped.,"I had my hopes up for a bunch of ""old fashioned bellylaughs"", and there were a few, but not nearly as many as I had anticipated. There were too many minutes spent wondering if I should fast forward through the slow parts. I didn't, but if I watch it again I will use that FFWD button and cut it down to about 30 minutes out of the 60. This is for the diehard fan only."
2,"Not the best, but ok...","The video had some funny moments, but what I think killed the whole thing was the narrator... she makes the whole thing uninteresting and she got on my nerves after about 10 minutes... It would've been much better if a guy was narrating the dvd since guys understand more about football than most girls. Over all it was ok."
5,Nice Introduction to the Order,"I'm a member of the Rosicrucian Order, AMORC and I think this book provides an excellent introduction for anyone interested in AMORC and it's philosophy. This work was translated from French into English and the only thing I found confusing was the use of the word 'sect'. It says that AMORC is not a sect. I agree this is true, but the way sects are described in the book I think the more appropriate word would be 'cult'. Contrary to the work of Pierre Freeman (AMORC Unmasked ... see my review), AMORC is definitely NOT a cult."
3,3 1/2 stars.,"futile though it may be, here is what i have to say about this cd: this is volume three of the cuca records story: a studio that operated from roughly 1959 to 1969 about 25 miles north of madison, wisconsion. oddly enough, the 3rd volume covers the beginning years. the rockabilly times of 1959-64. rockabilly in 1960? 61? 62? 63? and 64? you may well ask. remember, this was wisconsin. evidentally they were a year or two behind the times out in farm country. fun disc, though. no genius unearthed here, but a lot of pretty fine guitar slingers. if you love rockabilly, this is a nice set of obscurities for your collection. if you love the magic of music's ability to transport you to another time, this might be up your alley as well. if you are strictly a stravinsky sort of person, this will not do. look elsewhere."
3,not that interesting,"I had great expectations for that book based on the glimpses of ""low ports life"" in Liaden Universe books. Unfortunately, it is nowhere close to those. The stories are more typical for young starting writers - the plots over complicated, the styles overly dramatic and there is usually a ""profound message"" in most of them that is (in more stories than not) explained to a reader just in case the poor sod misses it on his/her own. Not a single story stuck in mind, in fact I would be hard pressed to name even one or two (or their authors). Pity, could have been a nice fast and energetic reading if the authors combined had a bit more trust in their readers."
4,So SWEET!!,We used these for the birth announcement for our son. It was so cute. The only thing I had to complain about is the sizes weren't listed when I ordered. But fortunately the t shirt and the onesie fit.
5,Another gem from Incognito,"Incognito came out with a new ambum. This time they did covers of seventees classics such as Everybody Loves the Sunshine, Summer in the City, and That's the of the World. they came with a new fresh sound for incognito, powerful string and violin sessions, excelent vocals of Carleen Anderson, Maysa, Joy Rose, Jocelyn Brown and Imani as well as Tony Momberelle. They also remade Always There, Still a friend of Mine, Everyday and Deep Waters, which have also a fresh and very slow beat to it. Altogether, this one is another smash in the line of Incognito music!"
5,i love the sunshine,"who is joy rose and where has she been hiding. everybody loves the sunshine is the bomb. talk about a nice cd. to bad the smooth jazz station here in las vegas never played this song on the radio, with all due respect to roy ayers this song was much better, though mary j blidge did it gorgeous also. track 2 everyday is also very smoothing and of course maysa on here makes me smile. glad i bought this one also, buy it folks and get your smile on, trust me"
3,OK but their traditional style is better,"I am a huge Incognito fan, having all their CDs and having seen them in person several times. This CD is a remake of many of Incognito's previous works. It is ""acoustical,"" not the big band party sound we are used to. Too bad -- that's what Incognito does best. It is like Incognito made into elevator music -- a watered down version of their work. Go for the other CD's; much better. Incognito go back to your roots!"
2,Circuit board burned out just days after 5 year warrenty exp.,"Genie Excelerator Model Number ISD990, bought 3/21/2004It was relatively easy to install and worked pretty well for 5 years. Almost daily use. Then after 5 years it started to have problems opening. It would only open half way and stop. It always closed properly. After a week or so of intermitent problems, it started not opening at all. I had to reset it (pull power) to get it to work. Then it just quit altogether. All the lights work, it just wont open. The green status light flashes continuously.I called tech support and they say the circuit board needs to be replaced. 5 year warrenty on parts is expired. Cost of about $130 if i replace the head unit or replace the circuit board. Either way.I just expect things to last longer. 5 years is way too short for a garage door. Not impressed with Genie. Looking for a replacement with a better brand vs. fixing the old board."
3,Not too reliable,"I have had this unit for about 4 years. I have had to replace the plastic carriage that actually pulls the door open because the plastic teeth disentigrated. Just last week the door would stop several times while opening. I called a technician out and he said the door was not balanced....he was wrong. The problem persisited and the tech returned. He added additional bracing at the midpoint of the track. The reason was that due to the extra force applied when opening so fast, the track would flex and bounce really bad (just like the other reviewer said). It has now worked fine since the additional bracing. Also, for some reason, I have to periodlically re-program the remotes...don't know what that is about. Anyhow, it has not been a trouble free opener."
3,actual case is much BIGGER than it seems in the picture,"i was looking for a small, sleek case for my friend's coolpix P1. the other grey case that amazon has for the P1 looked too bulky for my taste, with the flap posket on the front. some other website (not amazon) had listed this black case as one that would fit a P1. HA! when it came, i was shocked to discover that it was twice the size i'd expected. the material seemed quality (i like neoprene for protecting electronics), and it's a simple camera case. if it was smaller, it would have been perfect. so for anyone looking for a case for a camera anywhere in the size range of a P1, this one is way too big (unless you want one that's twice the camera's size) no matter what the pic may look like or other websites may claim."
5,"Pfenninger and Fowler's Procedures for Primary Care, 2nd edition","This book is a must for anyone doing procedures. It lists the materials you need for a procedure, how to do it, the care after, and the ICD-9 codes. The 2006 edition even gives you patient handouts, so you have it all. Do not waste your time on cheap knock-offs; this is the book to have. It was originally written by John Pfenninger, who created the National Procedures Institute, where doctors can take courses to brush up their procedures. I have the first edition, which is now in 3 pieces due to chronic use. I will get the new (2006) version from the publisher, since it is only $207 from them and includes: 2 DVD's, the website, the pocketbook and free shipping."
3,"a lot of breadth, little depth","I purchased this book based on excellent reviews on Amazon. I was disappointed. The book covers a lot of material, much of it of little or no interest to most of primary care doctors. For example it describes blepharoplasty and EGD, and a lot of similar procedures that most of PCPs refer to specialists. At the same time most of the procedure descriptions are covered very superficially, providing very few details, and not really useful for someone who is trying to learn procedures. Photos are of very poor quality, and are not helpful. The big drawback for a procedure book is the absence of DVD demonstrating procedures. Considering its huge volume, I decided it is worth the price I paid, and I decided to keep it. But I wish the authors devoted more space to relevant procedures performed by most PCPs and added good quality photos and DVD to help understand procedures."
2,Disappointing...,"Norfleet has assembled an interesting variety of photographs; however, her commentary is scant and superficial. Serious students of social history and of mourning art, in particular, are far better served by Jay Ruby's comprehensive work, _Secure the Shadow: Death and Photography in America_."
3,Seems to be killing my battery,"Easy enough to install although the cords could be longer so you have more options on where to keep it. I got the ""quick"" plug so I could plug in externally.. that was a huge joke. Almost impossible to connect permanently and had to glue the plug end in.I've been to the lake now twice since installing this and my batteries we're completely dead to the point I had to replace them. They are deep cycle so I wouldn't expect that even if I'd just left them not charging for a year... which I didn't.I like the idea but haven't had much luck."
4,Cant complain,"The charger looks nice, packaging is top notch- very professional. I like the moisture resistant capabilities of this unit. However this charger was purchased to replace an identical one that failed. I should note however it is being used in a rather extreme production environment. Would highly recommend it for personal use."
5,Would of had too buy a new 200.00 battery!,I have had my dump trailer for over six years and never had to change the battery (this runs the dump operation). I screwed up the charger. I ordered the same type of charger and installed the charger and prayed that my battery would take the charge. It took the charge! What a relief! Awsome product!
5,battery charger,charger works great!!! gives you a green light when batteries fully charged . very happy with it thanks
4,Marinco battery charger,"This is the second charger I've purchased, one with dual bank charging for my trolling motor batteries and now one for the cranking battery.The charger worked so well with the trolling batteries I decided to purchase the second. Definitely would recommend this product. Batteries always ready for cold starts. Reason for a 4 star rating is that nothing rates a 5."
1,wrong model is sent,"This is NOT the 2607A which has two 3 amp outputs and could have been wired for a 24vdc system, or a single 6 amp 12vdc. What you will be shipped is the 2608A which is a single output 12vdc, at 6 amps. I wish the model number listed did not mislead me."
3,"Sir John Fielding, Detective","There is an inherent danger in taking a historical figure and using that person in a fictional setting. Sir John Fielding was founder of the Bow Street Runners, the precursors to modern policemen and Bruce Alexander makes a valiant effort to turn him into the hero of this mystery. The details to the criminal investigation with the limitations of the forensics ring true and the characters are engaging. The mysteries themselves are very basic and some characters seem to be added just for effect, but all in all not a bad addition to the historical mystery field."
1,Don't waste your time on this sludge.,"Complete piece of garbage. Slow and boring movie with poor acting, lame actors, no story to speak of. I took a chance on it since there were no reviews. After wasting an hour and a half hoping something would happen to make it worthwhile (nothing did), at least I can spare other people from wasting more time on this cruddy piece of junk."
3,10 Minutes of Exercising,"Is it really possible to get a true workout in 10 minutes? In this amount of time you can briefly exercise a few muscle groups. Even though this video has good production value and a nice narrator, real Pilates can't be done in 10 minutes. If you want a Pilates basic video consider getting Pilates for Dummies because it's much more complete. You can get a full workout."
4,Not overly challenging; a feel-good workout,"I am a retired ballerina, so I demand more out of a workout than the average person. I did not find this video terribly challenging, but it features dynamic workouts that make the body more supple, capable, and deep-fiber strong. If you are looking for definition and muscle build, this is NOT the video for you, but if you are looking for a quick way to reach the deep fibers and produce a great feeling of well-being, then this video is perfect. I absolutely love Lara's encouragement, emphasis on proper breathing, and let's-get-down-to-business attitude. My favorite workout is the abs, followed up by the arm-sculpting workout. The others are simply not challenging enough for me.A great feature of the 10-minute Solutions series is the viewer's ability to mix and match the workouts into a customized sequence. Very cool. A great buy."
5,Really good,I'm very picky and this is an excellent exercise video. I can't rave enough!!!!!!! I use it via netflix at least once per week and have seen results quickly.
5,The best pilates DVD you can buy.,"As I said in my title review, this is by far the best pilates video I have ever used. And ONLY use anymore. The reason? Simple.Anyone can use it and get the same results. Fast.I was in a car accident a couple years back, so I am very restricted on the types of physical activities I can take part in. After gaining 40+ pounds after the accident (due to lack of physical activity) I was told by a friend to try this DVD out. I was able to do EVERY part of this video with no limitations. Its fun, its doable, and it gives what it promises.All I can say is I love love love, this is just an amazing DVD."
3,Good intro,"if this is your first time trying pilates or working out. I feel like this DVD is mainly for beginners or people who want a light workout. If you exercise daily or every other day like me, this may not challenging enough. I only felt a burn during certain ab and arm exercises. The legs, body blast, and flex did very little for me. The more redeeming section of this DVD is the ab workout."
2,"Interesting idea, mediocre execution","I have been taking pilates classes (mat and reformer) for over four years, and during that time have become familiar with several different pilates instructors and techniques. I purchased this video because of my travel schedule -- I like the concept of ten-minute increments. Although I did sweat, I was quickly annoyed by the instructor's ditsy voice, and her demeanor struck me as unnatural and contrived. I also felt like form was not well emphasized, despite the fact that it is the key to getting results in pilates. All in all, I'm glad I tried it, but it doesn't add much to an ever-increasing collection of pilates videos."
2,New Variations,"The 10 Minute Solution Pilates video doesn't represent the method Joseph Pilates created. Joseph Pilates taught people to workout their entire body because health and well-being come from using your mind, body and spirit. Joseph Pilates did not separate workouts for different parts of the body. For example, he did not say, ""Here is Pilates for abs,"" ""Here is Pilates for thighs,"" or ""Here is Pilates for back."" He created a holistic system. Try Complete Pilates for Everyone or Classical Pilates."
2,I guess I must have gotten the wrong DVD!!!,"I have this DVD at home & in my opinion, I THINK IT SUCKS!!!!I have several other pilates videos & it just wasnt long or challenging enough. I wish I could get my money back. I have read some of the online reviews & everyone else loved..So back to my original statement...I must have gotten wrong DVD. If you value your money dont buy this DVD!!!!"
2,Back In The Day,"I have been teaching Pilates since the early 1970s. I was fortunate enough to study with Joseph Pilates in the 1960s. Joseph Pilates would be happy to know his method of exercise is so popular. But he would not be happy about all the ways people change his method and lifelong dedication to helping people stay healthy. Joseph Pilates created a fascinating and complicated technique of body conditioning. And I never saw him teach a person for 10 minutes. 10 minutes would never be enough. Innovation can be helpful but not in this situation. For me, the traditional Pilates method can never be improved upon because it's too sophisticated and too complete. Please, no yoga-lates no bal-lates no aqua-lates no others."
3,Meh..,"Sorry to bust everyone's rating, but I did not love this DVD like others. First off, the instructor has a mildly irritating, fake-esque attitude. She's not the most fit either, which is sort of discouraging too. I get that others want to ""Relate"" to the instructor (whatever) but I want to see tip-top shape so I can at least fool myself in to thinking I have a chance at a body like that. Her cues are fine - but again, I have seen much better, more encouraging and fun DVDs. If you are on the fence about this one, I suggest you skip it in favor for one that has better reviews."
5,Like the Instructor!,"I ordered this as a gift because I couldn't find it in stores anymore and I liked my copy so much.I like Lara's calm, no-nonsense personality and pretty, but not over-the-top, non-distracting appearance and presentation.She's not bopping around with a bunch of cleavage like the person on the new 10 min. Pilates dvds I see in stores. To me, she looks like a lovely ""average"" woman and is not intimidating but pleasant especially if you are doing this around children or boys!"
3,Review for 10 Minute Solutions Pilates,"I used to have Comcast cable and loved the 10 minute workouts with Tonya Nettles, but I can't find any DVD's for her anywhere, so I bought this one by Lara Hudson instead. Out of the 6 work outs there is only one on here that I really care for. I do an hour long Pilates class once a week, so I'd say I'm fairly advanced, but I use these quick work-outs in the morning, so I was really looking for something low impact and focused on stretching, not so much full impact and strengthening. I really wish I could find Tonya Nettles on DVD!!!!"
4,"Great, now what","I bought this DVD a while ago. I really enjoy that there is motivational instruction without sounding like Richard Simmons. I did a 30 minutes routine 5 days a week that included stretching, abs, and thighs, along with cadio of sometype and got amazing results. My husband even noticed and there are bikini picutres I am not ashamed to show people. The only down side is there is no next step. After a while i got bored with the routine and wanted to move up a level. What to do?"
5,Fantastic Workout!!,"This is an excellent dvd. The production quality is very good...bright set, good music, great cueing. The instructor is easy to follow and challenging, and the workout is a intermediate/advanced level pilates workout. I have all of the Crunch pilates tapes and find this to be a perfect compliment to my other pilates workouts. I highly recommend this as well as the 10 Minute Solution Carb Burner workout."
5,Perfect Work Out!!!,"This DVD is really the perfect work out. I've been doing Pilates classes at my gym for a while now and I am yet find a challenging home work out that matches the intenstity and quality of instruction. This video absolutely does the job. I agree with some of the others saying that the ability to mix and match the sets keeps the workout fresh... and most importantly, Lara Hudson, is an excellent teacher. She is the furthest from ditzy or pedantic, she is just the opposite as she encourages and motivates. I will be on the lookout for more of her videos. In the meantime, this one is a keeper for my morning ritual."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I had purchased a tool belt for my grandson for Christmas 2011. It was excellent quality. When I went in to my history, I thought I was making a purchase of the same item. This was not the case. This item was inexpensive, but also cheaply made with very little play value in terms of moving parts and tool quality."
4,Great creative play toy,"My three year old loves the tools on this belt!We haven't had any problems with the tape measure (some reviewers mention it is easily broken), but it is a little small for toddler to operate the retraction mechanism.Excellent toy to stimulate creative play, great quality!"
1,Taken too long,This has taken way too long to get here. Classes require that you have your textbook asap! Kind of defeats the purpose to order one and not receive it in time.
2,THIS IS ONLY THE STUDY GUIDE,"Unfortunately, the seller did not mention that this is NOT the textbook, but a workbook to accompany the text.Damn."
1,Not Happy!,"I am not happy. Nowhere did it say that this was a study guide. All it said was that it was in paperback. I needed the actual book, not the study guide for the book."
1,"this is not textbook, but study guide","when you want to buy the book, make sure that the book is textbook, not study guide"
1,Business Law,"I did not receive the book to review. It was cancelled!!!I felt so bad about lack of communication concerning shipping and handling. If they need more money for the s/h, they should have been said so, but they quickly cancelled for it. It is not acceptable to me."
1,BE CAREFUL,"While this company ships the item quickly the ad is misleading. The ad says 3-pack for $7.40 HOWEVER, THIS IS ACTUALLY THE PRICE PER BULB. If you order 3 bulbs it will cost you $22.20 and you will get 3 bulbs instead of 9."
3,"Good content, but needed a bit more","This book was an excellent read, and provided some great information. However, as a math text, I feel like it should have provided a bit more examples, and perhaps even a solutions manual.I understand that the books main focus was on the abstract discussions of mathematics, but I feel like that should merit the writer to put a bit more examples to drive home the theorems before copious amounts of problems are assigned at the end of each chapter. A ton of these problems are classical, and need to be understood, in light of this, why isn't there a solutions manual to better explain these problems?I greatly appreciated the voices of the writers keeping themselves grounded in pragmatic language. Too often will mathematicians get lofty in their dictions and fuddle the material they claim to understand all too well. This book did a great job discussing simple concepts simply, meanwhile working the more difficult ones with more space."
5,Great proof reference book,I originally purchased this book as a text for a math course and quite enjoyed the selections that we worked through in it. It has been about a year since I took that course and I still find myself going back for references in the book. It is a must have for someone who is interested in proofs or will be doing them on a semi-regular basis.
2,Level is not appropriate with function,"My main problem with this text is the level of understanding it assumes on behalf of the reader. Many reviewers say ""great reference"" or something of the sort. But this book is a *foundational* text. It's not a book for mathematicians or a mathematically mature reader -- they should already own the techniques presented here. A book of this kind should be suitable for self study and this book fails in that department. Given the amount of math it assumes, I would imagine those at that level are already fairly assimilated to proofs and the like. Hence my critique that the level and function is confused. Note also that this book is *expensive*.If you want a book on problem solving, go with Zeitz or Engel, or something of ""olympiad"" character. If you want a book to learn proof techniques, Vellman or Eccles is good; Solow for true beginners."
1,worst textbook i've used,"I use this textbook in a math 300 class, the textbook is very dry, has little to no examples and illustrations.The author failed miserably in arousing interest in the subject(based on many similar complaints from my classmates), and i spend about 50% of the time asking myself ""why am i learning this kind of useless, twisted thinking?"" while reading the text book. Unfortunately i never find an answer to that question."
3,Review,The book was coming a loose from the center binder. It has a big orange sticker on the front of the cover that is hard to come off.
1,no solutions,"The material covered does not help you solve the exercises at the end of the chapter. I wish there was a solutions manual available, so I don't have to guess the answer and be left unsure of what to do to solve a problem."
3,Fire Fighter Night Before Christmas,It was fun. A AB ABC ABCD ABCDE A AB ABC ABCD ABCDE AB ABC ABCD ABCDEAB ABC ABCD ABCDE
1,Love this film--but it doesn't work on PS3!,"We have been able to watch this BD on a PC, but even with a current update as of 1 March 2013, our PS3 doesn't even see the disc. :("
5,Great Show on DVD,"A great live video of Lynyrd Skynyrd from a show in Louisville, Kentucky in 2007. I bought the DVD/CD combo. For some reason, the DVD has great quality, and is a great show but the CD does not sound as good. Almost as if the CD doesnt have good sound quality. Its really hard to explain. I really recommend the DVD only. Dont bother with the CD. This video shows one of the last times that Billy Powell and Ean Evans would share the stage. All the musicians have a lot of energy and spunk. Ricky Medlocke and Billy Powell really shines in the video. God Bless Lynyrd Skynyrd."
2,Video quality was a bummer,"Although the concert was awesome, and I have all the respect for the band. I had hoped that this dvd was as great as the concert itself was when it was shown on HD Net. Unfortunately the video quality was a huge let down. I was hoping for the same quality and clarity that it had when I first saw it. This was an HD Net production, I guess I shouldn't have assumed it would be the same show that's stuck on my DVR which is fantastic no matter how many times I've seen it."
1,nanowax,"I have bought this product from my hairdresser, and this product from Amazon is not the same product, it is a cream and not a wax and I do not like it."
1,An alternative to this CD,"An alternative to this CD, also by a cover band, but with versions that are closer to what the Beatles would have sounded like, is a CD called ""It's Four You"" by a group called the Beatnix."
1,"not too good, because it's a fire hazard during recharging",it's getting too hot during recharging. the high heat melted down part of the cover and deformed it.i'm not sure i'd use it again because it may be a fire hazard.
3,Rapid Aa/aaa Charger Kit,"The product itself does okay as a portable charger. It's nothing to brag about, but worth the money I paid for it. It serves the purpose okay, however this particular product brand is not something I would purchase again in the future."
3,Funny memories,"The Leningrad Cowboys are a throwback to the Elvis time, with costumes and all. The combination of the Russian Military Choir with this Rock Band is entertaining, if you like good oldies and traditional Rock. I enjoy it truly."
5,Irony at its Best,"The Leningrad Cowboys: Total Balalaika Show constitutes wonderful irony. I served as a US Air Force officer from 1969 to 1990, much of that time as a Soviet specialist and nuclear targeting officer. The Cold War was America's longest war, (1946 to 1991) and our third most costly with 100,000 American service personnel giving their lives on battlefields from Greece and Yugoslavia to Korea, the Congo, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and scores of other places you may never hear about. As students in my college class in ""Russia under the Tsars"" was filing in for the first day of classes, they were greeted by the Leningrad Cowboys and the Red Army Chorus hamming it up with ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" I began class by saying, ""Russia, what we think we know about that riddle wrapped in an enigma usually is wrong. Welcome to the history of Russia.""Five star fun!Earl H. Tilford, Jr., PhDProfessor of HistoryGrove City College"
2,Not very interesting selection; difficult references,"The introduction to this book states that ""learning to read a foreign language means learning how to understand texts that are aimed at native speakers and therefore take for granted references, contexts, and levels of understanding that are mysterious to foreigners."" In other words, this is not a book with selections written for students of Italian. I have been living in Italy & studying Italian for a year and have a decent command of the language. Even so, I have difficulty with the references in this book, especially in the many poetry selections. I think this book would be even more frustrating for someone who has not spent considerable time in-country. It is NOT written at a beginner level or aimed at casual students of the language. Furthermore, I found the selections rather boring reading. If I had it do over again, I would buy one of the short-story books."
1,Vegetable Lubricant,"I liked all ingredients listed except for one, vegetable lubricant. I have contacted the vendor and got the answer. It is something called stearic acid. It is up to you to decide whether it is harmful or not. For me, I do not feel comfortable taking it."
4,Music for those that believe that everything has gone wrong.,"This group has helped me get through life on a daily basis. If you truly claim to enjoy the difference between pretenious pop culture and harsh reality, then give it a chance. At least it's better than most current Steve Albini indie rock."
1,No Wave? No Interest!,"Consumers revolted all right, against this album. This is pretentious yelping from a band that imagines it is too cool to make rock music. Arty music that tries to hide the artyness with loudness but without passion loudness is just annoying. Why bother?"
5,Top pick!,"This is an excellent record. It has great dynamic range, from hard to spacy, and it is wonderfully dark."
4,"Good, but Lacking","Like many I have been waiting for this book for a long time. I rushed home after work so I could read it. After reading the note from Asprin, I got a feeling of dread, but I will get to that in a bit.The first part of the book was a little difficult to get into. The cliffhanger from the last book was not addressed until the last quarter of the book, which added a little confusion. Overall it was an OK Myth story. When you get back to the last quarter you really get the feeling of a MYTH story. But once you got used to being back in the MYTH groove Asprin throws you. I am not sure what his intent is. Is this the last MYTH book? I would really be disappointed if this is true. I really did not care for the ending. It leaves options open, but you get the feeling that this is the last Myth Book. I hope this is not the case.For us diehard Myth fans this is a good read, but for the most part is not a typical MYTH book. Hopefully this will be a new beginning like Asprin hinted."
2,"Okay, but disappointing","After so much time, to write such a brief standalone book which is to be concurrent with Sweet Myth-tery of Life was a mistake. The story here should've been included in that volume. It wasn't a bad story; it just doesn't belong as a separate entity. And the proofreading/editing was horrific! On the other hand, after the jibes I've taken regarding my own self-edited novel, this mess makes me feel better in a left-handed way. I hope Mr. Asprin and his publisher get their acts together for M.Y.T.H. Inc.'s future."
3,Wondering,"I haven't read the book under inspection to this date but I would not write of Mr. Asprin yet. He has turned out some real works of art and I for one could forgive any plot errors. And BTW If you think this was bad with it's spelling errors, Lords Critical, then I suggest you read the original Little Women and it's aftermath. THAT is spelling to give those of us who love reading and writing the worst of nightmares!"
4,Nice ending,"If if wasn't for the ending, I'd have given this three stars. There are setups with no payoffs, and this story isn't as well written as the recent ""Myth-ion Improbable"".Specifically, they have abandoned Klah as a mideval society once and for all, and I'd have been happier if RLA had explained it as Deveels, now knowing Skeeve as they do, had revised their opinion of the dimension and started trading there and most of the changes had come over the past few years... but.. anyway...The last quarter of the book is a return to form, and pays off the whole six book arc as well as it can, and I liked the ending. Not recommended as an intro to the series, but for long-time fans, it was cool."
1,Something Myth Inc.,"The something missing was a story. The book appears to be an outline that wound up being published. The only part of the story that had any meat was uninteresting and the rest was unsatisfying.It appears that Mr. Asprin was only going through the motions to complete his contract for this book. Mr. Asprin's writer block was very obvious and the only good comment is that he at least tried to meet his commitment.The book was long delayed (it even wasn't available in September as it was advertised) and should have remained Mything in Action.Since you don't allow 0 starts, this had to be rated 1 star."
2,Sad ending to such a good beginning...,"This series started off so well! The first few books of the M.Y.T.H. series is so fun and entertaining... and this one just feels like Robert Lynn Asprin is just trying to get it over and done with. Well, mission accomplished, and I don't think anyone will be begging for more!"
3,Something IS Mything,"Did not enjoy this book as much as the rest of the series, it fills in a few gaps in the overall series storyline, but the humor is sadly lacking here. I always look forward to books in this series, but I have to say the ""short story"" at the end (Mything Instructions) was way more entertaining than the ""main title"" of this book. It will be on my shelf for two reasons, (1) because I'm a completest when it comes to series and (2) the short story in the back."
3,It's good to have closure!,"I have to agree with the general sentiment expressed in other reviews. I'm very glad to see the promised final book, but it certainly could have been better. All in all, it's rather forgettable, but it was a lot of fun to see the series conclude."
3,I waited 25 years for THIS!?!?!?,"Oh well, at least we're done. A thin book, but important for completists. I'm glad I have it, and I'm happy I read it, but I won't be reading it again."
1,Huge Let-Down,"I am a HUGE Aspirn fan, but this is by far the worst book he has written. It read as if he just wanted to finish the series to fulfil his contract. Every time the story looked like it was going somewhere interesting...it fizzled. Overall, it was simply a boring book with a disapointing ending."
4,Fun and a bit Silly,"If you have a couple of hours and a silly sort of mood, this is the series to read. I finished them quickly and had some good laughs."
2,Save your money,"The book is OK, really. However it has some of the worst editing of all time. There are HORRIBLE grammar errors (it's/its and you're/your and to/too) as well as spelling errors, numerous typesetting errors and so forth. It's bloody horrendous and reading it is impossible because you'll be so distracted by that.As for the book, it starts of well, ends well, but the problem is everything in the middle. It wanders, rambles, and deviates finally remembering it's a book with a point."
2,Disappointed,"I have had several water feeders over the years and this one I like the least. The water container comes in two pieces it has a lid that has to be snapped on in 5 places. The snapping takes significant force. I have to hit hard with the palm of my hand in all 5 places to ensure I get the ""click"" ""snap"" sound. If you don't make sure you hear that click and snap in all five places there is good chance the lid will come off when you turn it over. I turn mine over the sink to be safe but the point is that this feeder takes more effort and work to fill than it should. As I said I have used others over the years that were much less effort and potential for water spills that this. They were easy to fill. So get something else is my advice."
3,Pendant WAAAY TOO SMALL!,"The pendant is almost as small as the earrings they set as purchase togeter, it says 1 inch lenght, but it's I guess around 10 centimeters(yes I like the MKS system more), soon I'll upload a video, as well, the box where the pendant comes, it's too large in comparison to the pendant, it makes it look even smaller that it already is."
5,The Used Book Lover's Guide to the Central States,"Truly a treasure map for the reader! Even if the book did not necessarily give a favorable review of the different book stores,it was a blast to seek some of these shops out. The main drawback to this book is it becomes dated when a tiny bookstore doesn't make it and shuts down. But I've been to some of the shops that ARE still open and loved them all! I was also able to find books that are waaayyy out of print. If you are looking for ignorant used book sellers to sell you a 1st edition ""Gone With the Wind"" forget it. Most book sellers in this manual are savvy when it comes to the trade. When I retire from my real world job and open my book store in 14 years, I hope to be listed in this book. Please keep revising and printing this one!"
2,not his best work,"first of all, i want to say to anyone reading this review, don't get me wrong, tupac was a brilliant artist. i'm not giving him or his music 2 stars, but this collection of ""poetry"" does get the 2 stars. it was a horrible collection. i bought it expecting so much more, but he makes the mistakes that so many other young poets make when writing. in fact, i the only reason i'm even giving it 2 stars is one for each of the good poems in the collection (the rose that grew from concrete & in the event of my demise). there is a lot of promise in the poems, but he needed more work. if you really want to find tupac's poetry, listen to his music. that's where his poetry is."
2,I expected more...,"I bought this book because everyone kept telling me that he was a poet and his words were deep blah, blah, blah...I was disappointed to find that his poems were simple and not ""deep."" It is not his best work. His best work will be found in his music, not here.I had expected a lot more in this compillation of poetry.Don't missunderstan me, I love the artis and his music. I was just expecting more dept and originallity in the poetry. I think I will stick to the music as his best work! Long live Tupac Shakur!!He gets two stars because I did like the very last poem."
1,Trite,"I have a lot of respect and admiration for the late Tupac Shakur, and he's actually one of my favorite rap artists, though, admittedly, I am not the biggest fan of rap. Unfortunately, this book of poems does not serve him any justice. He did write these during his teens so he may not have found his voice or his calling quite yet, so that's understandable, but the poems themselves are basically cliches written in the syntax and spelling of most rap artists. This book is mainly for die hard fans of 2Pac or completists who are doing research or whatever. Other than that, get one of his albums."
5,Moving,"I found the book of poems by Tupac to be very moving and insightful of how he felt in his everyday life. From is heartaches and struggles of freedo within our society, I can feel his pain and hear his voice as I read each poem aloud to myself. I knew he was deep, but I had no idea."
5,An immortal collection,"When one thinks of 2Pac, does poetry come to mind? Of course we all know he could rap and rhyme, but not like this. The way that the actual words he wrote, the way he wrote, were a tremendous asset to this book. RIP 2PAC"
5,pepeljara,its so good for one page..nice to now to somebody care about fan of tupac ..:PP but heh im from bosnia and u can now that some ppl in bosnia takecare about tupac shakur .rip man..nad that all by ppl from bosnia/tuzla....
5,Greatest Rap Poetry Ever Read,This is a great book to futher understand 2pac and the foundation of all of his music but the book has to much love poems but he was young so dont hate. Just Open your mind and read and you will find something that stimulates a feeling of that you can relate to.
5,tupac was a rose to his fans,"i love the book ""The Rose That Grew from Concrete"". I have read this book about ten times and I got it yesterday. The book shows Tupac in a way that his fans never really saw. Tupac, to me was a very talented man. i hope everybody will buy this book, so they can see the softer side of Tupac."
5,Truly Poetic,"This book gives great insight into the mind of a man called Tupac Shakur. I will treasure this book for years to come. A masterpiece, one of many from this great man. I do not write this to try to convince you to buy it. I want to try to convince to at least pick up the book and read the very last poem. I'm positive that you'll end up making this book part of your collection."
4,cant judge this!!!,"im a 2pac fan , always have been. i haven't even read this book and believe it to b sum of tha mans best work. i say that because poetry is the foundation of this ""god"" or thug immortal. it was his way of escape, he was tha shakesphere of tha 21 st century. tupac fans all know"
1,sorry to say this,"all the stuff from this book is from when he wasn't famous yet. he didn't have anything to say back then. he was a very profound person but i wasn't compelled with anything he said until he started looking at political issues and crimes and society in his raps. When he was in his late teens and early 20's and had to deal with the corruptions of society, that was when he had interesting, even brilliant things to say. But, not before. I'm a big Tupac fan, but this wasn't worth it. He just talks about love and it's cheesy and the rhymes aren't very well done. Get stuff from his more recent times to really understand his character."
1,The rose that grew from concrete,"This is a very disappointing book of Tupac's work. Be reminded that these poems were written when tupac was nineteen. It doesn't account the events tupac encountered in the highlights of his career. I was expecting to see more of his feelings towards other rap artists. I also thought that as a poet, Tupac limits himself but as a rapper, he has exposed his lyrics to a higher level. There are a few poems that are worth reading tho' but they're already all over the net and plus they're all super short. Maybe he put a romantic or sorrow connotation to poetry. Besides that, just ""don't believe the hype."""
2,NOTORIOUS BIG,dont care i give tupac props but biggie is tha man as goes for mobb deep so u cant test with what i have now hahah
1,Don't waste your time.,Being a pop icon does not make you a great poet. First off Tupac needs to learn how to spell and he also needs to learn that cute little pictures are not words. Do not waste your time.
5,the rose that grew from concrete,"My people argue whether or not that tupac is alive. Either way, he lives through the pages of his book. this book makes it possible to get into tupacs head and to some level understand the thoughts and emotions of the legend of his time and forever more. I would suggest that every one read this book. A good book like this is hard to find and only comes around a few times in a life time."
5,the best rapper ever,"if you ever wonder what should i read, read 2pac's a rose that grew from concrete by tupac!! it is the best! tupac was one of the best rappers ever i agree with what he said when he was alive and now that he has pasted i listen to his music and read his books more and more each day me and my friend are gettin shirts made in memory of him , my homeboy chad is doing them for us he follows everything tupac ever said or did! WESTSIDE 4 LIFE! R.I.P. TUPAC SHAKUR!EMAIL ME IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS"
5,Deep,"No, some may disagree but tupac is alive. He is telling us this through his works of poetry. I think this is a great book, a great insight on what was going on in his teenage years as well as what is going on around us today."
5,This book is the bomb,I love this book it is soooo cool. When I went to buy it at the book store the guy said that a lot of people have been buying this book. I payed full price. :| So good adice buy it from amazon it cost less. A LOT of my friends haven't heard of this book when I told one of my friends I had the 2pac poems book they were like whats that and he writes poems? ANd I was like yeah. then they said they wanted it cause its buy 2pac
2,A Promising Poet,"Tupac's ability to work with words so well at such a young age was his trademark and is what made him a prominent celebrity in the hip-hop world. This publication is fascinating, mostly because of the copies of his handwritten words and interesting use of ideologies.However, as a poet, Tupac really was just a 19 year-old boy writing about his feelings and thoughts. Despite the recent tidal wave of interest in the collegiate community, his poetry is nothing to get excited about.I would recommend this to anyone interested in observing the process it takes to capture words the way Tupac was able to do so well later in life. Don't let this work compromise the talent of one of the greatest lyricists of our day."
5,Only for the realist,"I feel that this book truly shows Tupac for the person he was. This collection of his works allows the world to view the side of Tupac that the media never showed. Through his poetry, we are able to see the intellectual side of Tupac-the softer side of Tupac. His death was truly a waste of talent. I hope that people will continue to love Tupac for who he was as I always will."
5,Tupac Shakur was a wonderful poet - His spirit lives on.,"Tupac writes about events he sees, hears about, or has been through in this book. His poems are well written and show a side to Tupac no one heard in his music. I believe many people can relate to these poems. They gave me a sense of hope, but also an even greater sense of loss because Tupac died in the prime of his life and he still had so much more in him. I hope that this book opens peoples' minds to the fact that Tupac was an intelligent and even sensitive man."
4,Good but some changes need to be made!,"There is a lot of good poetry in this book. However, it annoys me how they translated Tupac's written words but kept his shortenings. For instance, Tupac often used 2 instead of 'two' or 'to' and 4 instead of 'for' as well as C instead of 'see'. That is fine but when they write it in common text they should really use proper words. It makes the poetry not run nearly as smoothly and makes it seem worse."
5,love it,Love it!! Great addition to my collection. This item came very quick and was packaged properly to prevent any damage!! Would recommend to anyone.
5,Beautiful Poetry,"This book is so inspiring. I bought this book about 3 years ago and I read it at least once a month it's that good! I even got a tattoo that says ""The rose that grew from concrete'. Definitely check this one out!!"
5,Wonderful teaching tool!!!,"I am a middle school English teacher who uses this collection when teaching a poetry unit. While most of Tupac's writing is rough and unedited, it shows students that poetry is a beautiful way to express ideas and emotions. Young people are so full of passion and idealism. Someone as famous as Tupac started off similar to them... Small with bigs dreams and a hunger for growing up and changing the world. It's not so much about rap but about the art of lyrical poetry. My students find it fascinating and inspiring."
5,Great and touching,"The poetry is passionent and shows the true self of a great star. If you like poetry and tupac, Get this book now. The most enjoyable about this book, is that the original poem has been printed in his handwriting and a computer writen version."
5,Tupac is deep.,"Tupac ideas and thoughts are extremely powerful, and have a deep impact on the mind and soul."
4,Creative Teenager,I love the fact that the book also includes the original handwriting of the author. That is quite usual. I love the throughts coming from one so young.
5,Overjoyed,To say that we(my 2yr.old and 6yr.old) are extremly happy with this purchase is an understatement. By far this is the best on-line purchase I've ever made. I was very pleased with the item's price including shipping cost and how promptly it arrived. I would defenitly use this seller again.
3,I Wonder Who Wrote This?,"""Cop Out"" is a fairly conventional 60s suspense novel about some cheap hoods terrorizing a policeman and his family. Fans of Ellery Queen will wonder why this is an ""Ellery Queen"" book-- it's obviously ghost-written by somebody else, and has nothing to do with others in the series. (""Ellery Queen,"" the detective, makes no appearance whatsoever.) The plot's a bit improbable, but the book isn't bad, and it ends fairly well.If you're looking for the real thing, read any of the early Queens from the 30s or 40s."
3,Needs updating,I rate the basic construction methods as fair. I rate the styles as poor as they are very dated. Value for amount paid good.
1,Caribbean Bay Rum Key Lime,"This is not a bad smell, but certainly not a good one either. It smells more like an antiseptic than a cologne. Strangely enough like one part Bay Rum and two parts Chloraseptic and I detected no lime scent at all. It's neither sweet, clean nor flowery... its smells sterile like a chemical or some sort of medicine. That is my honest opinion.. some may like it... my friend said it smells ok on me. I think I smell like a lab technician."
5,A warm picturebook tale of animal friends,"Lynne Cherry's How Groundhogs Garden Grew may require parental assistance but kids with some prior picturebook skills will relish this story of a little groundhog who loves to eat the vegetables in his neighbor's garden. The cycle of a gardening year is told within the structure of a warm picturebook tale of animal friends, and the drawings are especially engaging."
5,You will not be able to put it down.,"Misplaced People is utterly stunning in its emotional impact, in the depth of the characterizations. C.G. Devise draws you in from the first page, making you feel for these characters, making you root for them.It is the story of Striker West, an American woman with an outer shell of steel and a fragile soul lying beneath in pieces. Striker is on duty at a London hospital when a woman is brought in after being savagely attacked. The woman is unidentified and alone, and Striker is drawn to the comatose patient. She sits with her when her shift ends and reads to her. This becomes a daily routine until Morien Llewelyn's brother identifies her, and her family decends on the hospital.This should have ended Strikers compulsion to take care of the woman, but it does not. She becomes obsessed with Morien Llewelyn.Misplaced People is filled with mystery and intrigue, but ultimately, it is a beautiful love story that really touched me. I loved this book."
2,"An Illustration, which Fails to Illustrate.","One would imagine that the comic version of ""How to Master the Art of Selling"" would probably include illustrations of what the book is about. Instead, it is CliffsNotes pasted into speech bubbles on pretty much irrelevant panels. I don't think this product has any real value to anyone."
1,I order it but i havent got it yet.?,I havent get the book yet???? back order it is been like almost 2 months?
2,"Please, forget the hype.","Another predictable ""Look at me"" book on sales. Whilst the author may well have made some money doing one thing, I wouldnt ask him to sell water to a thirsty man. Im tired of ""ego"" books and would suggest Keep it Simple Stupid, by william j montgomery, a real salesman who can sell anything and his book shows you how, (and no its the one book that isnt an ego trip for an author) as an alternative to this book."
3,Hard to sift through the lip service and bla bla,"Perhaps it is because I'm a database consultant and have grown accoustomed to technical manuals, but this book seemed like a big pile of salesman bs. Granted, it explained good techniques for selling; it was just hard to stay awake through all the extra blah to get to the meat."
3,Didn't realize it was all comics,"The original book is fantastic, not into the comic book approach at all. Print too small to be legible on my Kindle."
1,How to master the art of selling,"This book was not as described when I made the purchase. The description did not make mention that it was a comic version. It wasn't expensive to purchase, but returning the item is not cost effective. It would cost more to return and pay the restocking fee than I originally paid. When I contacted them with my complaint, they were unhelpful and unsympathetic. I'm very disappointed."
1,Not even close to explaining the fundamentals of selling,"Good book only if you have no concept of selling, otherwise this book will hinder sales. These sales concepts are outdated and do not really assist any salesperson to close more business. My recommendation is don't buy if you have any sales experience."
1,Old techniques = Useless techniques,"Unfortunately, Tom Hopkins is a victim of his success of the 1980s. This used to be a great reference book for selling. Sadly, that is no longer true. Buyers are so used to dealing with the techniques mentioned here that the buyers can actually get angry when these selling strategies are attempted. Everybody knows these closes and has heard them for years. If you as a salesperson want to master your craft, you need to drop the old image of a 'peddler.' If you attempt the tricks in this book, you'll brand yourself as an amateur. Save your money on this one, it's old news."
2,Door to Door,This is a great read if you're selling things door to door. I don't recommend this for the serious-minded major account sales person.
1,Don't waste your time with this one.,In its day this book was okay. Now it's dated and its advice is somewhat manipulative. Try Miller & Heimann's books. They are much better and will allow you to create productive sales relationships.
1,Dud!,"I read a lot of sales books and I had heard of Hopkins, so I decided to pick this ""book"" up.What a disappointment.The book was nothing more than a marketing piece for his organization.Do yourself a favor, pick up something original and not this sham - try S.P.I.N. Selling, Selling to V.I.T.O. or any of the consultative selling books out there and pass this one up."
1,"Beautiful book, but poorly edited.","This is lushly detailed book with fine reproductions. However, I found the book to be full of editorial errors and blunders. Why should consumers be asked to pay one-hundred dollars for a book that is this poorly edited? Profits should go towards finding new editorial help. Let's hope the new edition finds someone in charge that is more organized and observant."
1,Best of Race Car Bash Ups-,"This is the worst quality video I have seen yet. Repetitiveannoying, loud music throughout- fuzzy out of focus video. jumps around from trucks, to boats, and you can't see anything clearly. Terrible."
1,A big disappointment,"You can find out much more about Selena's life and discography from Wikipedia (not to mention other web sites) than from this DVD. A few no-name teenagers are interviewed but there is no interview with Selena. This DVD has no music and no music videos of Selena Gomez. Video and sound quality is amateurish, at best; sound level fluctuates from quiet to loud. I make better quality videos with my $200 HD camera and Windows Movie Maker. It's not so much a waste of money to buy this DVD (it is cheap), but it is a waste of your time waiting for the DVD to arrive in the mail and waste of time watching it. My recommendation: read about Selena on Wikipedia, download her music videos and other clips from YouTube (for free and many in high definition) and forget about this DVD."
4,A Hidden Classic.,"Why I call it a hidden classic is because like a lot of science fiction it can be dated, but the concepts brought out in this story seem to be very viable today, and in a way, even more so. Just what are the consequences of human colonization? This book dives right in and shows what could happen, especially if your ride to that new planet is with a ship that has acheived sentience. After reading this I look forward to the other two books in the series, in fact I just finished The Lazerus Effect, but I am going to let that soak a little in my brain before I attempt a comment."
4,Herbert's little known series.,"The book is fantastic as I already knew. The only down side is that now that I've reread this book on Kindle, the rest of the series is unavailable in that format."
5,"Great Commentary: Balanced, To the Point, Well Contemplated","Anything by John Stott has to be good. I am preaching a series through Thessalonians and have found Stott's work to be my favorite. Stott offers the meat, veggies, and potatoes. Good stuff.If you are not familiar with Stott, he is a conservative evangelical with faith in the integrity of Scripture. He seeks to interpret objectively, seeking the meaning intended by the human author and how the original recepients would have understood these letters.Although I do not necessarily agree with every single interpretation, I confidently recommend this one for pastors, Bible teachers, or serious laymen."
2,For younger than 5 yrs.,"Although this book is called a ""classic"", and listed as appropriate for 5-year olds, I think it's better suited for 3 or 4-yr. olds. I won't even read it to my twin grandsons who are 5 because I think they'd be bored silly. It's very dated as far as children's books go."
2,Terrible ending ruins an otherwise good book.,"Everything in this book was actually pretty good, and what might have been a ridiculous and silly story was done very well. Except for one thing.I despised the ending. It left me confused, dissatisfied, and resenting the main characters. None of their actions made sense to me and weren't consistent with the rest of the story. I even was expecting Pete to wake up and kill Shaunghessy in a lucid fit of rage at the end. Even that would have redeemed the book and partially satified me. But no.I rarely write Amazon reviews, but I'm making a special case for this one. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,A book well worth reading for anyone of any age,"I first read this book the year it was published. I found it by chance on the shelf of a local bookstore. I was young as Peter was young when I read this book. It so affected me that I have never been able to forget the story. I visualized each part, each scene and can still today remember them vividly. It changed me much as Peter's adventure changed him...I'll never forget it."
3,well written,"Ariel was a well written story, that pulled you in from the beginning. I couldn't put it down, but when I finished the book, I was happy to (put it away). I hatted how it ended, I would NOT recommend reading it!"
2,"Fun dialogue, horrible ending.","The banter between Ariel and Pete is amusing. The plot, though, doesn't make much sense. And the ending is one of the worst that I've ever read. The information presented about the author shows him to be a real piece of work."
1,Very useful for starting campfires.,"This book is awful. If this is an apocalypse novel then the gaping plot hole that never gets answered is, what happened to 300,000,000 people that left all of the canned goods sitting around uneaten and no corpses? You also have to swallow hole the idea that the main character wants to hump a horse with a horn. EWWWW! To add insult to injury the author believes that you can learn all you need to about martial arts from library books and a helpful samurai in about a week. Ditto what everybody else said about undeveloped characters, a flat unimaginative landscape and zero development of the idea of magic as an everyday fact."
4,A Boy and His Unicorn,"A really good post apocalypse fantasy of the caliber of Brin's ""The Postman"" or S.M. Stirling's ""Dies the Fire"". What if technology stopped working and in it's place was magic? This is the story of a boy becoming a man. This is the story of Teenage Angst and dealing with rampant hormones while navigating the relationship battlefield.If I would have read the premise of this book beforehand I probably would have skipped it. Probably why they don't have a picture of a unicorn on the cover. Unicorn of not this book is well worth reading, is extremely enjoyable and it ages well like most classic science fiction and fantasy does."
4,Entertaining but predictable,"Good revision of his previous book that could have been updated even better with a current view of New York. Interesting but unfulfilled expectations of an alternative reality world where magic takes over from science. The ending is somewhat predictable, but plants the seed for greater works to come."
2,A katana wielding hombre with a bad-ass unicorn buddy,"If I had understood that that book was written by a 19 year old about a talking unicorn, I probably wouldn't have purchased it. Upon discovery of that alarming fact, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that that the book is in turns twee and testosterone. A katana wielding hombre with a bad-ass unicorn buddy straight out of the daydreams of Napoleon Dynamite. There are some good ideas here and the story telling is a mixed bag."
4,Highly imaginative fantasy,"I was captivated by the original cover art - a boy and his unicorn against a city skyline, and picked it up. I've never regretted it. I recently reread the electronic edition with the author's notes, and find that even with the added knowledge of how it came into print, I still really enjoy the fantasy world Mr. Boyett creates - a changed world in which certain things work, mythological creatures exist, and a young man tries to live by fighting, when necessary, to survive. If you're intrigued by magic, have a fascination for mythological creatures or survival in a world where swords are the preferred weapons, this is definitely worth checking out. I haven't read anything like this book since."
3,A 19yr old's first try...,"Mr. Boyett was 19 when he wrote this...and it shows.There are several ""hits"", from very weak world-building, leaving too many distracting and lingering questions for the reader, to a complete lack of research regarding a few key elements of the story...but mostly I have only one concrete complaint, and that is with the ending. Was there one? The ending was very abrupt, confusing and extremely disappointing in how it was presented. I didn't have a preferred ending in mind, but I did expect to read one. This is actually the first and only book whose purchase pissed me off. I didn't expect a true classic, but I did expect my time to be well spent. It seems silly, but I felt cheated."
3,Don't Overthink It,"In this reprinting the author spends time in the afterward describing what it was like creating his first novel. Even without him explicitly saying so it wouldn't be that hard to guess that was the case. The choice to have characters bounce between geographical locations is odd. The sequence of ""boss battles"" proceeds strangely. There are maddening inconsistencies in the ""changed"" physical universe. Even the main antagonist is left underdeveloped; if there was no time for fearsome detail then the story would have been better served by a shadow of the reader's own imagination. However, the story of loosing one's innocence is poignant. It is understandable why this book is such a favorite among teenagers: the story of a samurai-sword wielding familiar of a unicorn isn't as removed from their experience as we might think."
3,Ariel,"This was a book that was somewhat interesting but I think that my teenage grandson would have liked it more than I did. The author wrote the book when he was 19 and it was not bad writing for a 19 year old. I'm sure that there was some kind of message one was suppose to get from the book, but I'm not sure what it was."
5,Woody at his best !,"This picture, along with ""Hannah and her Sisters"" and ""Zelig"" are, to this date, Woody's best films. Well, you can add ""Radio Days"" and ""The purple rose of Cairo"" to the list. It's a ""to see you is to love you"" kind of film. The screenplay is as polished as it can be, the cast shines throughout and you'll leave the theatre with the feeling (very rare theese days) that yu've seen a great movie. No wonder the crew gave a round of standing applause after some scenes were shot.Moving, funny, cinical and very, very humane, it's not to be missed."
5,Woody Allen at his best.,"I have not seen all of Woody Allen's films, but based on the few I have seen I can quite easily say he is one of the most talented writer/directors of all time. The film is dramatic at times and funny at others. Not only is this the best Woody Allen movie I have ever seen it is one of the best movies I have ever seen."
4,"a long long time ago, woody allen made good movies","woody allens best film since the 70s (and hey this one was 18 years ago!) features great acting turns by martin landau, sam waterston, alan alda, angelica huston, jerry orbach, joanna gleason, claire bloom, and even the usually awful mia farrow (who it might be noted hasnt been cast by a real director she want sleepoing with in 30+ years). his nod to dostoevski (however you want to spell that guys name) is clear in both the title and theme, and for once (maybe its because he only plays a minor role) one of his his post-""manhattan"" manhattan movies comes off as real instead of stilted."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An unsucessful merger of two vastly different plots, one of which would be given the attention and nuance it deserved 16 years later in Match Point, Crimes and Misdemeanors is one of Allen's bleakest films but not one of his best; watch Match Point for the thriller plot or Hannah and Her Sisters for the relationship plot."
1,Blah,"It's time I face the music, Woody Allen does nothing for me. I think I've only mildly liked one of his films and I keep watching them expecting that I'm going to have that 'a-ha' moment when it all clicks and I figure out this man's appeal. The truth is: it's not going to happen. Woody Allen's appeal is just going to have to pass me by. From what I can make out of this, the two running stories in this film have nothing to do with each other. There is a theological question posed, I supposed with Martin Landau's character and of course it's left open ended. Allen keeps trying to pass himself as a leading man, but it hasn't and never will work. I was bored thirty minutes into this thing. Watch at your own risk."
2,Outdated,"I ordered this book without having seen it before, and was diasappointed at how outdated so much of the information is. For example, most of the references are 1960s and 1970s, many much earlier than that, and practically nothing after the mid-1980s. The illustrations are overrated in the description, most are poor quality B&W and the vegetation map is nothing to get excited about. If you want plant lists of the different vegetation types, you get that, and the information is probably accurate in that respect. However, I returned my copy for the refund!"
1,Marta Hari,"The blurb on the back cover is enticing enough. Although quite misrepresentational of the plot. You expect one thing and get another. A novel attempting to fit into the literary genre by being 'different'. If intense unhealthily co-dependant relationships bordering on psychosis are your thing, buy it now. If you're looking for a love story that will tug at your romantic heartstrings - forget it. I read the book from cover to cover in the hope the end would justify the means of having to wade through a depressing relationship clearly destined for tragedy. The violent and even more depressing ending did not justify the means. I consider it sacrilege to burn any book, but I'd make an exception in this case. Why have the words 'literary' and 'entertaining' become so mutually exlusive?"
1,"Sleazy, sad and brutal","I finished this book reluctantly because I don't like to abandon books half way through, but now I wish I hadn't bothered. It's not what I call a love story, or even erotic. It's an account of a woman's systematic humiliation and degredation at the hands of various lovers, culminating in the brutal and unnecessarily graphic murder of her one true love, accompanied throughout by her belief that she deserves no better. The love scenes between the women which could have been tender in another context, were marred for me by Sofia's passive acceptance of fate and the inevitability of what had to follow. Why would anyone who loves women write a book like this? Save your money."
4,Distinguished Writing,"The story suffers from a contrived ending, but the writing is so fresh and evocative, the characters so deftly drawn, that the book is a pleasure to read just the same."
4,My own thoughts,"The story sticks in your mind until the last page turns. It makes you feel like you are there, living with these two women and what love can really be like. To find someone your exact double, who can love you in the way that only you can understand. I would recommend this for those who enjoy exploring there emotions."
2,"at least they won't explode, burn, or shock you","But they're not too good when you take them out of the box and look at them. The pick you actually get doesn't look anywhere near as good as the picture on Amazon. It is a thin sheet of plastic, rather crudely stamped out, grainily printed with a fourth generation carbon copy (misaligned) of the picture shown on this page. Unlike the magnificently stained glass jpeg you see, the actual pick looks faded, crude, and cheap.As a pick, it works OK, but not as good as a fender or martin, both of which are shaped and sanded to a fine, tapered finish. It is unashamedly stamped, poorly cut, and crude in the face of the beautiful picture, which looks nothing like the actuality of the pick you get. But just imagine, what if a pick really looked as good as the pick pictured here? Wouldn't that be something?"
2,"Ok, but not the best","Yeah, family friendly, but if you're an adult watching it while babysitting, you can't really understand why the adults are so useless in the movie. Someone steals the hermit's animals and goes to make them into food/furs, and he just lets them. The bad guys hit him with a car, and apparently that translates to ""Well, he's old, so naturally he's having issues."" The poachers kidnap the girl, and the cops and her dad just stand there like idiots. The horse is pretty, but you can see he has mane extensions in several of the shots so it looks a little bizarre. I know it's supposed to be for kids, but why do these kid movies with horses always have the village idiots? Can't they write anything decent anymore and stop hoping all we're looking at is there's a horse in the movie?"
1,Waste of Money,"I am not at all impressed with this resaw guide. I had a difficult time keeping the blade going straight because of the curve on the face. I used it on my first attempt at resawing and immediately removed it. I made another cut without it and it was perfect. However, I am using a blade made for resawing and spent time calibrating the saw. Over all, I am not impressed with Kreg products."
3,"amusing, annoying, poorly written","Kary Mullin wishes he were Richard Feynman. Surely you're joking, Mr. Mullin.Amusing anecdotes alternate with strangely self-contradictory rants about government-sponsored science and medicine. Luckily, there aren't very many pages and the type is pretty big, so it goes quickly."
1,Awful.,It is beyond comprehension that this guy won a Nobel Prize! I'm sure they would take it back if they could. At times he sounds extremely intelligent and insightful but the use of LSD and the belief in astrology and aliens is very hard to reconcile with a rational mind. I agree with a previous review - I think he's had one tab too many...
4,Wow! What a trip!,"Once you get over this ego of his and get over some of his...""paranormal experiences"", he actually brings forth and exposes the reader to alternate views that are present in the scientific community that are not very popular and therefore typically silenced. His views and arguments on such topics were to me the more interesting parts of the book. No matter if you agree or disagree with him, they are still valid points to consider. At the least, the book provokes great discussions and makes you curious enough to want get out on the internet do your own research on his theories.Easy to read (even if his writing is not well-edited) and funny, this is a book that is worth the read if you are at all interested in the scientific field or just like to read biographies."
3,Uneven,"The author discusses a wide range of issues, such as astrology, the hiv-aids hypothesis, drugs, and other kind of out there things. It's fun reading about his experiences being attacked by grey recluse spiders, possible alien encounters,etc...He makes some nice arguments for things I don't agree with. However, he could have elaborated greatly on most of these issues. The book is way to short to really cover all this. And some of the personal anecdotes are tired, weekend magazine type stuff. So, it was good but could have been much better."
3,"Intelligence, humor, and an ego","I'll have to start by agreeing with most of the other posts and say he does have a big ego. The first time I heard Dr. Mullis speak was at a college scholarship competition. I was blown away at his outlandish ideas. My thoughts were ""Where did they find this guy?"" and ""Who or what makes him the almighty?"" Therefore I decided I had to read his book. The book was basically a summary of his speech, but with more detail that allows you to understand what he is thinking. Overall, the main idea of the book is not to be locked up in the traditional cage of thought, but let your mind freely question and explore. This book should be read for enjoyment and to broaden one's own little, enclosed spectrum of life."
3,It definately makes you think,"It is an interesting book;it is beneficial in that it allows a person to see that most innovations in science today are small steps toward a greater goal. Furthermore, it makes the average joe feel he or she can also be a nobel prize laureate. The book also mentions many of Mullis' life experiences which were very strange and intriguing to say the least."
4,The Title Tells All,"One usually associates a Nobel prize in Chemistry with a techie...but Mullis is a bit of a free spirit and uses all of his brain when he thinks. He is the classical ""out of the box"" thinker. If you like eccentrics (all my heros are eccentrics!), then read this book. It won't change your life or opinions, but will give you some entertainment."
3,"Entertaining, but take it with a grain of salt!","I picked this book up because he seemed to be a character out of the Feynman mold -- eccentric brilliant scientist has comic adventures and pokes fun at the science establishment.It starts out as just that. Unfortunately, about halfway through, be begins to wander from the trail of science into some uncharted territories which he claims are equally worthy of study: astrology, astral plains, telepathy, control of the weather.... HIV does not cause AIDS....He destroys whatever credibility he had by failing to be critical when it serves him not to be. So yes, it's an entertaining read, he's a cocky and petulant iconclast who sounds like he'd be a lot of fun at a party.Just don't take everything he says as gospel. His whole schtick is that people shouldn't take anything at face value -- which must include his book!"
3,Extremely provocative but entirely undocumented.,"Extremely provocative scientific claims unsupported by a single reference would normally be ignored but cannot be when, as here, the author is a Nobel Laureate. Does he know what he's talking about when he says HIV does not cause AIDS, freon is not dangerous, cholesterol has not been proven dangerous, etc.? Who knows? When he says that a law was passed by the German ""Bundestadt"" (presumably he means ""Bundestag') and that middle A = 880 cps (it's 440), he clear doesn't. Very frustrating."
1,Pathetic,"Inflated, egotistical, and self-serving beyond measure. Kary Mullis wastes our time with his dull anecdotes and half-cooked philosophy. If you're looking for insight into the scientist's creative process you won't find it here. Mullis gives us only a few pages on his discovery of PCR -- basically he stayed up real late thinking about it. So late that his girlfriend fell asleep. Imagine. Hell, this doesn't even work as fluff -- unless hearing about passing Marcia Clark in the hall at the O.J. trial floats your boat. I'd rather read star-boffer Angela Bowie's book. At least she delivers the goods."
2,Proof you can win a Nobel and still be a dimwit,"I'm wary of people who write outside their area of expertise, and this book is a good example. Mullis is a big fan of astrology, yet he ignores the fact that astrology uses such sweeping generalizations that it could (and does) describe anybody. He also advocates exterminating a type of spider and says that environmentalists are liars. Why? A spider bit him, and he didn't like the explanation for why spiders bite.The one good thing about Mullis is that he made me want to make a few calls to the local university and find out the other flaws in his thinking."
1,"Use PCR, but read Feynman.","My lab uses PCR almost every day and I thank Kary Mullis for making my research possible. Unfortunately Kary Mullis seems to now have turned his efforts towards convincing the public that scientists are unethical, lazy and stupid. His fascination with astrology and mysticism are acceptable. His misinterpretation and twisting of data are unforgivable."
1,"Unfounded, Disorganized, Egotistical, and Bizzare","The possibility for anything profound in this book is far overshadowed by his absurd denial-ism of the HIV to Aids connection, CFCs to Ozone depletion link, and the possibility of climate change in general.. He talks about being abducted by aliens, the ability to be in someone else's mind, and gives credit to horoscopes and astrology.I expected this book to illustrate an interesting life philosophy or, at the least, tell his account of his invention of the PCR. Instead, all I got was a collection of disorganized rants by a narcissist.Pick this book up if you're looking for bizarre stories about LSD fueled trips, alien abductions, and experimentation with drugs. If you're looking for something worthwhile, look elsewhere."
2,Not worth 5 stars,I bought this book based on the 5 star reviews and was disappointed. The funny parts did not counterbalance the lack of science and excessive opinion and ego. I ended up feeling that I had just paid more than $6000 for a no-show.
5,FUN BOOK to read,"This book was a very fun to read. I read the whole thing in a day. I couldn't put it down. Very spiritual, and intelligently written. He has a lot of insight into many of the issues of the times, and you might be surprised at his outlook. I would highly recommend this enjoyable book to anyone."
1,What a Shmuck!,"I was buzzing along, fifty or so pages in, thinking, 'Not bad, a little cocky, but what the hell, he won the Nobel, give the guy some slack,' and then it happened. He went to work for O.J.'s defense team. Not only that--he and O.J. passed notes about chicks during the trial! There's nothing that pisses me off more than a brilliant man with no soul, so I tossed the book in the trash."
1,Devastatingly disappointing,"This is a well-blurbed book, and I really looked forward to reading it. Nearly as soon as it arrived I set aside everything to read it. What I liked about it was his open-mindedness and curiosity and playfulness. What disappointed me were the factual innaccuracies and just general lack of precision thinking. I learned a good bit about Kary Mullis, but I didn't learn much else. A very disappointing, weak book. Can't recommend it, although mericfully it is not a long read."
3,"A five star character, but it's hard to detect here","As Mullis says, the Nobel Prize will open any door, once. And, yes, it will sell a few books. I like Mullis, and think PCR is exceptionally important, but this is three star book that feels like the author didn't really care about it... like he'd spent the advance and had to produce something, anything."
5,An extremely funny look into the life of Kary Mullis.,"One of the best books I've read in a long time. An easy read, even for those without a science background. In fact there isn't that much science in it. It's all about his life and his experiences with aliens, drugs, and winning the nobel prize in chemistry. I LOVED IT."
2,Dancing Naked in the Mind Field,A very mediocre and arrogant book. The only benefit I got from it was the feeling that profound scientific truths can be discovered by accident.
1,Worst book I've read in ages.,"It doesn't contain any interesting science, the 'alternative' stuff is pointless, the political views are mis-informed and self-contradicting, the writing gets progessively poorer to where the latter part of the book is hard to read, and I can't imagine that it would be any fun talking to the guy.I did draw one thing interesting from the book: There's no reason to assume that Nobel Prize winners are other than discovers of something that turned out to be really useful. Which left me a little disappointed."
3,Build Your Own Robot?,A collection of Karl Lunt's articles from Nuts & Volts magazine. This book is not as much of a step by step guide as the title would imply. There is plenty here for the advanced robotics hobbyist as there is for the novice. A welcome addition to my robotics library.
5,Top Notch,"Beginning and advanced robotics builders will find Build Your Own Robot! a rare coverage of all the basics involved in building a robot, from hardware to the author's own code used to program robots. Build Your Own Robot! is as much for the hobbyist as for the student of engineering and promises to reach a wide audience with in-depth details, tips for building very different kinds of robots, and specifics on circuitry and how to avoid problems."
3,Not for someone who knows nothing about Robots,"I always wanted to build my own robot, but when I decided to purchase this book, I read a couple of reviews from beginners and thought I'd take their advice. Well, for all of you people out there who are just as lost as I am, this book will get you nowhere. As someone who has an open, intelligent mind, I just don;t get it!"
1,Suspicious,"I used this book for many years when I taught my third graders about the Native Americans who lived in Minnesota prior to the arrival of the Euro-American settlers. I became uncomfortable using it when I learned that the word, ""Sioux"" means ""enemy"" or ""snake"" and is a bastardization of the word the Ojibwa had for their enemies, the Dakota.I have also learned recently, from speaking with the Native American families in my school, that I should be suspicious of and try not to use books about Native Americans that are not written by a Native American.I looked for a better book to use and found Michael Bad Hand Terry's book, ""Daily Life in a Plains Indian Village 1868"" (Clarion, 2001). It has a lot of great information, gorgeous photographs, and is a more accurate portrayal of the Native People of that time. I feel much better using it."
5,Grandson loved the book.,"Purchased this book for my 7 yrs. old grandson. They were studing about the indians at school. He is a 7 yrs. old who loves to read and wants to know about things. He restores alot of facts on things, so this book was perfect. It also arrived as stated on website."
5,WONDERFUL Product! Very versatile and easy to use.,"I've been using this program for about two years now. It is so versatile. So many choices in making up worksheets. I love that I can tailor my daughter's penmanship to what she really needs to work on. Specific letters, cursive, manuscript. Whatever she needs to work on and I can keep it at her level. I often make up worksheets with her spelling words, so she gets practice at both spelling and cursive at the same time.I also love all the font choices. We use Palmer Cursive, but there are many other choices as well. I highly recommend this product."
5,Best price to performance ratio,This is my third vaio and as usual I am very pleased with its performance. This laptop is very reliable and I just adore it.Thank you Sony !!
5,Most pastors will be grateful for this book,"""Weaver and his colleagues have produced another winner for clergy: a casebook which covers most of the difficult situations in which pastors are called upon to be a first, and sometimes primary, support and helper. Each case presentation is followed by critical issues to be aware of, relevant information, including community and national resources. Most pastors will be grateful for this book a number of times each year. Sections in the first chapter on the child's personality development and on effective parenting will be appreciated by most parents."" --David K. Switzer, Emeritus Professor of Pastoral Care, Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University"
4,An expansion of one of the classic vampire organizations.,"Presenting the vampire Covenant (political faction) known as the ""First Estate,"" Invictus provides well thought out insights and clever plot hooks for the oldest and most powerful vampire Covenant. New Factions, Bloodlines, Disciplines, Devotions, Merits, and Ghoul Families are presented along with a substantial amount of descriptive setting material. In every instance the new game mechanics support organizations and ways of thinking within the Invictus, and provide more than just a list of new toys."
2,My Two Cents,"I bought this when I got my two ferrets because of Marshall's warranty. After doing some research on what's good for ferrets and what's not. I'm not very please with the fact that the 3rd ingredient that this food has is ""Corn"". Ferrets are meat eaters and cannot digest corn. From what I've read, corn is actually bad for them and can cause intestinal problems. My guess is that Marshall's is using it as a ""Filler"" to save money instead of thinking about the ferrets well being. Sure they warranty the ferrets for one year as long as you keep them on Marshall food, but my thinking is that it takes more than one year for problems to show up in your ferret.I won't be buying anymore of this product. Do your ferrets a favor and research the ingredients of this and other brands before purchasing this."
2,OMG THE SMELL!!,"I thought coming from Marshall's that I would get a better product. It smells awful. It REEKS of fish, filling my house with the awful smell. It also makes my ferrets waste smell worse. I will not buy this product again."
2,Tad dissapointed,The book was not what I expected as far as graphs etc. It came apart also and I had to re-glue the binding.
5,great earrings,"Love these earrings, they are very flattering, especially since I have a round face. Quick delivery too."
5,BEAUTIFUL EARRINGS!,"THESE EARRINGS ARE SO NICE, THEY LOOK LIKE WHITE GOLD! THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH TO GO WITH THE MOST DRESSED UP LOOK TO JEANS TO SHORTS! THEY COMPLIMENT EACH OUTFIT YOU WEAR WITH THEM. THEY ARE REALLY SHINY AND SPARKLY AND DROP DOWN JUST THE RIGHT LENGTH! BEAUTIFUL EARRINGS!!!"
3,Poster is blurry,The poster was blurry & looked like it had originally been a small picture & scanned and made bigger. It's not bad for $.01 except the shipping makes it actually $4.
4,A Poster With a Message,"This poster now hangs in a coworker's office, and it always causes a ruckus! Is it offensive? Is it art? Who cares?The only issue I've had, is that the poster was very clearly folded in half upon arrival. Not too much of an issue, but certainly takes away some intrinsic value."
4,poster,"my only complaint was that it came a little wrinkled but other than that, cheap, quick devlivery, and good looking"
5,Perfect,"My teenage son wanted this poster for Christmas, but I couldn't find it. Thank you! He loves it!"
3,CASH!!,Well its a poster of johnny cash giving the finger wht else can i say.except that i got this one in a frame.
2,Mixed blessing...,"The author presents some incredibly useful laws (i.e. tithing, goal setting, forgiveness and fulfilling your purpose) which will indeed be transformational. The reason they are transformational is that they were established by God and are all biblical concepts. And although Gaines makes the point that real prosperity goes well beyond financial blessings (certainly true), many of her examples seem to belie this (""If you want a solid gold toilet seat, you've got a right to it."" - p. 96). The truth is that God does want us to prosper and is eager to bless us as we align ourselves with his purposes. I'm not convinced that God's eager to bless us with a gold toilet seat. Gaines ignores the fact that there are also many examples, both in the scriptures and in our world today, of very spiritual people who have not achieved financial prosperity. The bottom line is that while an abundant life is a biblical axiom, it does not always translate into material wealth."
5,An amazingly concise guide,"It's like having Edwene in your pocket ! If you've seen her in person, this book captures her exactly. If you haven't, then meet her here. She has an amazing grasp of the simple principles you need to achieve your kingdom."
5,Fun and enjoyable,"Edwene is very personable in her writing, Her stories are sincere and the reading is easy. It is a fun prosperity bookwith personality"
5,A Wonderful Guide to Living a Life of Abundance,"Having experienced Edwene Gaines in person and found her to be a dynamic and motivational speaker, I was happy to see that her book reads much like her seminar and is filled with her own stories of how she applied these spiritual principles. Anyone who is trying to prosper by working hard or coming up with gimicks to make money needs to read this book. It is more about what is going on inside of us than what is going on in the world. I highly recommend this book!"
1,This is a compactflash type2 card,"I bought this compactflash-card to use it with a canon digital elph, but got quite dissapointed when it came in the mail because the card was a compactflash type2. This card is thicker than type1, which is more common. My camera only handles type1-cards, and I couldn't find any information on the page for this card that it was a type2. Not even the manfacturers modelnbr. ..."
2,Boring,A slow moving boring movie. I was hoping for more laughs. The actors appeared to be doing the best they could with the material they had to work with.
1,on your mark. get set. terrible.,Pam is still hot but doesn't make up for possibly the worst script ever.I'm not sure I could write a better script but I'm fairly sure if I wrote that script I'd toss it in the trash where it belongs.
4,Great Mix of Talent,"Vagrant has done it again, mixing a great lineup of songs into a cheap comp. Highlights include songs by Hot Rod Circuit, Saves the Day, Audio Learning Center, Dashboard Confessional, Hey Mercedes, The Anniversary, and a song that I actually like by Alkaline Trio. I'd have given this cd 5 stars, but the songs by the Get Up Kids and No Motiv, two band I like, weren't exactly the greatest. Also, A song by Reggie and the Full Effect would've been nice. And Vagrant's lineup still includes Face to Face, so that automatically means that at least one bad song is on this comp. I do recommend you buy this however, because it's cheap, good, and we all have a skip button for when those face to face songs sneak up on us."
3,Not quite what I expected...,This is an extremely detailed account. It in fact reads much like a text book...dates included.
5,Nice Handbook,"This should be the book in a class required for all chemical engineers, and they should be bound to the equivalent of an engineer's Hippocratic Oath after reading it.Do not expect detailed process diagrams on how to sustainably produce plastics and other products, but do expect short and concise guidelines and considerations for the production of things from a life cycle perspective. An engineer might be deeply interested in producing a material with some key ingredients to make it stronger and cheaper, but the last 60 years have shown us that this kind of myopic progress leaves a trail of waste and health hazards behind it. This book addresses that concern by outlining considerations for making things, achieving the purpose of their manufacture, yet also considering the lasting impact in a cradle-to-grave life cycle. The principles are sound and do not interfere with the engineering process, but instead add to it."
