1,Too Confusing!,"I am a student and this was our text book.. I have had to go out and buy 2-3 supplimental books because I couldn't follow this book, if anything I have used it for a notebook.. What an incredible waste of time and $$. Our instructor wasn't happy that we had to us this book in the first place. Not the best for beginners to follow, its good as a reference book and that's about it!"
3,Excellent Introduction to Java Programming,"This is an excellent introduction to Java programmming. I was able to learn to program in about a month by doing all of the exercises as I went. LeMay is an excellent author of instructive material. However, her co-authors leave a lot to be desired in their chapters.The book suffers from an incomplete transition from the Java 1.0.2 version that preceded it. I look forward to reading the Java 1.2 version in the hopes that the transition has been completed and the co-authors have been dropped."
2,Not impressed,Does not meet my needs. Very few new and exciting ideas for trainng. Good for those that are new to training.
1,The Ten-Minute Trainer,"I'm always looking for good tips to include in my ""Train the Trainer"" classes. This book was a complete waste of my money. I would not recommend to anyone - even a complete novice"
5,Quick and Easy Ways to Break Up a Lecture!,"Dave Meier, the director of the Center for Creative Learning, and Sharon Bowman's mentor, must be very proud. The Ten-Minute Trainer is chock full of quick wonderfully imaginative ways to engage learners that work beautifully in all types of training sessions. Need to break up a lecture with limited time to spare? Sharon offers 1-minute, 5-minute, and 10-minute accelerated learning techniques that also address the needs of the kinesthetic learner, who is often the most difficult to satisfy in a classroom. I've used learner-centered experiential training techniques for over thirty years and cannot believe how easy it is to incorporate her techniques! My personal favorites include the time sponge, pop-up, grab the spoon, mark up, and the walkabout. I've already used them and my participants love them! Every lecturer and trainer should keep this book handy!"
2,For novices,"I looked forward with anticipation to gathering some great tips to add to my training repetoire. Unfortunately, I found the book to be incredibly repetitious and elementary. How many different ways can one put ideas on a sticky note and share with the person beside them? A disappointment."
5,It's a must have for engaging the learner in the process.,"As a presenter and trainer for over 16 years, I know the value of keeping the learner engaged in the process. Sharon has been contributing ideas to keep energy and fun in any learning environment for a long time. With a bookcase full of resources, I've found this book to be among the best to apply review, retention and energy to my programs in a quick and easy way. Even the ""Sage on the Stage"" can transform the learner process by applying some simple principles and training tricks found in this informative and valuable resource. I wouldn't be without it. And my learners are the real benefactors."
2,Au contraire,"This book is 77 pp., half its pages are blank, and it lists for $22. The quality of its poems is uneven; one, ""The Gambler,"" is banal. I'm disappointed in my favorite poet and more so in his publisher."
5,sublime.,"Words fail me in praising this. Simply put, it is one of the most over-looked, classic texts of the 20th C. Platonov writes in a style that combines a dreamy, surreal sensibility of the world with a hard, trenchant, unflinching look at the characters who inhabit it. My copy of this is dog-eared, full of notes and underlines- aspiring writers take note- Platonov is a writer who is to be studied, as much for his subtlety and lyrical elegance as his tough-skinned presentation of ruined lives; people trying to craft some order and peace from a world, and largely doomed to fail.I'm being a bit too romantic, too hyperbolic. I probably shouldn't have attempted this. But I want to put my two cents in as concerns this work, because I love it. It is a marvelous book."
3,Ok,"Upon perusing the exuberant user comments about this book, and after reading said text, I was quite disappointed. The novella is good, but classic it is not. I was expecting a wonderfully innovative novella that made innovative use of language within the confines of a sharp, satirical story--especially after reading some comments that Mr. Platonov was maybe the great 20th century Russian writer. Instead, I found a rather simple allegory utilizing typical Soviet-propaganda and speech. It was good, and a very courageous novella to write, but a little too simple, not all that innovative, and well, it doesnt hold a candle to other Russian 20th century writers such as: Bely, Bulgakov, Nabokov, and Sologub--all true innovators of fiction, that also held a light upon Russian culture/government and revolution. Of course, comparing the work with the aforementioned authors is perhaps unfair. Still, it is an excellent read."
1,One Night in Bangkok,"Like several others who wrote in, I was mainly looking for the popular version of ""one Night in Bangkok"". Just wanted to say that I was finally able to find the popular version on ""Just Can't Get Enough: New Wave Hits of The '80's, Vol. 14."""
1,This must be different night in Bangkok!,"I shelled out nearly $20 for this CD since it's an import. Like most people, I know one song by Murray Head, ""One Night in Bangkok."" It's not even the original version, it's a re-make of some sorts, which is not as good. There's not much of anything else on this CD that's great either. If these are his greatest hits, then clearly, I'm not a fan."
4,Easy to take,These capsules are a big improvement over taking 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar straight. I started taking vinegar because I heard it helped with controlling blood sugar levels. I probably will order these again when I run out.They do not burn the throat like liquid vinegar and do not leave a lingering taste in my mouth.
5,Use it every day,The apple cider vinegar helps with acid reflux and for me it also diminishes sugar cravings. I've recommended this to many of my friends and I was happy to find it on line for cheaper than what I was paying at Sprouts.Love IT!!
4,Fireplace a plus,"ben Watt is mainly known as the guitar playing half of England's folk-pop outfit ""Everything But The Girl"". This, his only solo effort so far is a beautiful, melancholy album that shines with emotion and lyricism. Watt plays soft, Bossanova influenced electro-acoustic Guitars and sings in a voice that seats somewhere between Nick Drake & Morissey... This is a must for any mellow music fan who is looking for an original, simple album that will be your best friend for a while."
5,memory chip,"price was economical, purchase was easy, delivery was quick, plugged it in and it worked!"
3,PC133 512 mb memory module,"Item was shipped out FAST! Arrived only a few days after the order was placed and well ahead of the predicted date. If only all suppliers were this fast . . . Item was easy to install with simple instructions, even I could do it and I'm no computer whiz at all. Great service, fine product. 5+ stars."
2,Do your homework before you buy PNY,"PNY memory is not very specific on its products, check and re-check that the specs. are what you need. PNY is more a reseller of dubious memory brands of asiatic origin (not that others are'nt, but...), pay the extra and go for respected brands like Viking and Kingston, you can't go wrong. In the long term, it's a better investment."
4,got The wrong memory upgrade,I was very happy with the price for this upgrade memory. however it is not for the Apple Lap top I bought it for. It was not labeled very clearly.
5,memory,PNY OPTIMA 512MB SDR 100/133 MHz PC100/PC133 Desktop DIMM Memory Module MD0512SSD-100/133great product thanks
1,Skip this one,"I bought 12 of these surge protectors for my office. They looked nice and priced right but after trying the first five, two of them were dead. I didn't bother with the rest and returned them all."
5,No complaints,"I have a 2000 honda civic ex, has a jdm d15b stage 3 vtec and they fit, was kinda worried because it was not the original engine. You can see the quality built from ngk, do recomend ngk spark plug, no complaints, this product gets a 5 from me."
4,This is a good workout,"This is a good workout, but I must say it's not my favorite Ellen Barrett DVD. She's not quite in her element with this one, but as always, she does her best, and she delivers. It's a good addition to your ""Ellen Barrett DVD Collection""."
1,Crap!!!,"I had one of these and it's crap. Freezes a lot, when you turn it off, you might have a problem to get it back on to keep the right temperature. It takes forever to ""calibrate"" itself. Poor technology."
4,PSD111,"Good thermostat-easy to use. The only thing I don't like is you can't set the temperature unless you are on heat or cool, so when you switch to heat or cool you may turn the heat or A/C on which you might not want to do. Then you need to adjust to turn it off. Otherwise very user friendly and works well."
1,elmers tub and shower repair kit,"Not very impressed with kit. Used as described and followed directions included. Finished repair did not match shower surface. Repair areawas dull and flat while original material shiny. Also, found that materialcomes off in time with cleaning with some bathroom cleaning products.I could scratch it off with my fingernail after I used a typical shower cleaner. Not worth the money. Elmers better just stick with glue for now."
5,"This ""Blaze"" lives up to it's name...and then some!",The tension between these two starts out at a 10 and then just keeps building. I carried this book around my house the entire day until I had finished it! Carly Phillips is a woman to watch and I can't wait to read her next one!
5,Solid feel and construction; excellent vintage replica,"I have several of these plates throughout the house, installed 10 years ago. Had to replace one, due to placement in a bathroom, where water spotting over the years dulled the finish. All of the others in the house have not lost their luster or finish. These are solidly made and look just like the plates in Victorian-era houses in my area.Switch plates were packed to prevent scratching and quickly delivered."
2,"Silly little book, and not in a good way",This is a silly little book that did not hold the attention of my 3 year old. There is just nothing to it. Learning to read can be done with a book that is interesting and fun; I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,Meh,"I am one of the biggest Geoff Farina fans out there, but this album unfortunately does not deliver. The other Secret Stars album far outshines this one to the point that I never really listen anymore. There are a few nice tracks, but overall this album drones on, both of their voices seem to adolescent to be captivating. Her voice especially, I dont know why she records music."
1,"Should be a free promo video, not $19.97","Nicole's OM work is good, and the video is well produced, HOWEVER, this DVD is really just a promo for the OM work, and as such, should be a FREE give-away. There is no depth to the presentation, it is mostly couples sharing how groovy the OM work is. Selling this DVD for $19.97 is, quite frankly, bad business, and to the producers - if you are reading this, please consider NOT charging people for an advertisement for your work. To the public: don't waste your money on this DVD - just get the book: it has everything you need in much better detail than this promotional piece. It gets a one-star rating based on the fact that they are actually charging for the DVD at all."
3,It had its strong points,"Anshaw's first book, Aquamarine, is one of my favorite books, so I picked up her second novel with trepidation. And sure enough, it's not as good as her first novel, but the complex relationship between the two lovers is fascinating. Anshaw takes the time to explore and examine all of her characters and therefore it is an in-depth look at relationships of all kinds. I liked how the ending left the reader hanging; to neatly tie the ending with a nice bow would have been disingenous at best."
3,this book needed more work,"this book felt like it was unresolved. a woman's partner dissapears, and she slowly learns about her and her own lives... but nothing seems to get accomplished..."
2,Not So Great,"Unfortunately, this is not a great book. One would expect better from Piers Anthony but, with Firefly, Anthony does not deliver. Everything is too easy in this book. The characters leap to conclusions with no real logical means of doing so. Things seem to simply be presented to them. The characters don't really have to work very hard to find the answers to their questions. Everything just falls in their laps. I was monumentally disappointed in this book. Piers Anthony has written some wonderful books in the past but this is not one of them. Perhaps he has spent too much time in Xanth where things are expected to come easy and he has forgotten how to write a grown up novel. Too bad."
1,Pedophile,"I am disgusted by this book. Used to be a fan until I read it.Anthony basically endorses pedophilia. To the nth degree.Really, this is the sort of book censorship is made for."
1,Really disturbing,"I picked this book up at Target when it first came out however many years ago having enjoyed some of Anthony's other titles as a teen. Wow this toxic piece of drivelfuzed into my brain, searing the unwholesome grotesque images straight into my memory most robustly! I think I understand the sick magnetism sexual compulsives must feel when such material is hardwired into them. Just a jolt of this was enough to make me tear the thing up and throw it in the garbage. Is society tolerating this as some kind of Art?"
4,Great horror book,"this is the first novel of Piers Anthony's I've read. I liked the way the characters all came together. Its about ""something"" going around killing people, leaving only the bones and skin shell. With pheromones the creatures renders the victims helpless(horny) and death soon follows. About losers coming together. About sexual and physical abuse and the consequences of the abuse afterward. Plenty of Sex!In the afterward Piers Anthony states that the book was banned by bookstores (they would not sell it) because of the content."
4,"Ok, so maybe not a horror novel","Piers Anthony delivers another stunning book. True, not the best work ever written, yet still something to curl up with when you are looking for a good read. A tale packed with sexual cravings, love gained, death and abuse. I love how Mr. Anthony attacks some of the topics in this book because he deals with some of the more ""touchy"" issues according to popular culture. He writes of the abuse that two women receive in their marriages; he deals with the ancient tales of mythology bringing alive, once again, Paris and Helen. The characters are so developed many have a second secret life, not apparent at first yet gradually building though the story. After hunting for over a year for this book I got my hands on a copy and read with utter delight the story for a second time. The idea of the firefly is so unique you have to applaud Mr. Anthony, if for nothing less than a brilliant idea. I agree the book shouldn't be a horror novel, yet it is still an excellent read."
1,"Oh, Please!","A long-time horror fan, I had never read any of Mr. Anthony's books when I bought Firefly shortly after its original release. The concept is original and has real promise, but amateurish writing undermined almost everything the author attempted to accomplish. Offended by the sexual content? Not in the least. Offended by the apparent lack of care and attention in writing and editing? Absolutely. I even now recall this book as one of the worst reads I've ever experienced."
2,Somebody definitely should confer with Freud,"Admittedly, Piers Anthony was one of my favorite authors until sometime in high school when I realized that he's just another dirty old man. Every book he's ever written has had some form of elicit sex or sex at the very least, and if it isn't elicit then it's presented as a purely animalistic function. This book is no different. In this book the widow gets to cure the impotent caretaker. And naturally the predator draws in his prey by, you guessed it, pheremones, and apparently if you get too close you can't stop orgasming (is that a real word?) Can you get any more adolescent? This guy is in his fifties or sixties and still enjoys writing about young girls and their menstrual cycles.But I digress. If you're looking for something completely unrealistic and sexy, go ahead and grab this book and a moist towel and enjoy yourself."
1,firefly,"If i could give this book a lower rating, I would. Never have i ever seen such blatant abuse of the exclamation point in all my years of reading. The dialogue is sophomoric and even the sex scenes are unfulfilling. (Did anyone ever finish the actual act without ""spending their seed"" before they could even make penetration?)He tries to justify Nymphs sexual tendencies by stating, ""We have problems enough with world hunger and injustice, without making more by punishing people for deviant but perhaps harmless behavior"" Sure he's speaking of homosexual, bisexual relationships (which i do not consider to be deviant in any since of the word) but to classify child sexual abuse in the same context is an abhorrence.All in all, i did not enjoy this book and since i believe in finishing what i start, upon completion of this travesty, i promptly tossed it in the garbage."
1,Execrable dialogue,"I probably hadn't read a Piers Anthony book for over 40 years before a co-worker loaned me this one, but have always thought of him as a big-name sci-fi writer. That's why I was so stunned by the amazingly stilted dialogue. Real people don't talk that way. I don't know which surprises me more, that the writing is so bad, or that a fair number of readers describe it as well-written. Compared to what?! The numerous stories come across as intrusive, the author continually interrupting the flow of the narrative so we can see what a story teller Oenone/Jade/Nympth, etc. is, but it finally just becomes boring. Nor was I conned by his author's note at the end, in which we are to understand that what looks like a paedophile friendly worldview is just his attempt to bring to light the problems of child and wife abuse. Yeah, right."
5,Works Just As You'd Hope,"We had a squeaky step under some standard pile carpet. I wasn't too optimistic that we'd be able to do anything about it, but, with this kit, we eliminated the squeak in about a minute. I haven't tried these screws on a hardwood floor yet, but they worked like a charm on our staircase."
5,No More Squeeeeeks,This product worked as advertised. We used it through carpet and it worked extremely well.
1,Not zinc diecast but cheap plastic,"I originally saw this product on Tom Silva, This Old House and i liked the idea that the tool would not be another disposable item. but when i ordered it, i got a plastic not a Zinc die cast alignment, and depth control fixture light described. you are supposed to be able to twist screws with it but i doubt i would be able to get many twists out of it. Somewhere along the line, the manufacturer change the material used but left the description the same. That's cheating."
1,didn't work for me,"Put one more in the loss column, as it didn't work for me. I've driven about 20 screws into the carpet, and there has been no improvement on any of the squeaks. This product seems hit or miss, and it's a miss for me. Maybe it's a function of my poor floors, or it could be some sort of operator error. The ""This Old House Guy"" makes it seem so simple, but i didn't have such success. Good luck everyone."
4,worked some how,"worked in one piece of my carpet on the noisehowever, the nail is not cut well so I can feel it with my foot on it. may be hurt me in the future. May need check the manual more careful before i work on the second point."
2,"So far no good, we'll see","I just started using this and have not gotten it to work. The problem is the screw not going deep enough, so when it snaps off it leaves about 1/8 to 1/4 inch above the carpet, which of course needs to be viced out. Maybe I'm doing it wrong since most other people seem to have no problem, but no matter where I screw in it doesn't happen. The joist finder isn't good, better to find the joists from the crawlspace and measure distances between them (usually 16''). Perhaps eventually it will work and I'll revise my review but for now this was a waste. Any suggestions are welcome."
3,Hi Tech,"The product works. However, the following issues were noted:1. The screws do not break easily. I used a bit more powerful screw driver to break the screws.2. The screw position tool is made of plastic and does seem to last.3. It is difficult to pull out screw head after it breaks.4. For hardwood floor application, the effective length of the screws is not long enough to enter the joists, if you want to tighten plywood floor to joists. The screws can be used to stop squeaking caused by pieces of hardwood floor. You will need combination of this screw and joist screw to finish the work.For the above reasons, I gave three stars for the product."
3,Good but not great,"This product worked as advertised but definitely is not a solution to all types of squeaks. It worked well in some spots of my second floor, but the joist finder is such a pain and is far from exact. Also, if you have berber carpet, double your work time because you have to tape every screw and the joist finder each time you use it or your carpet will be eaten. Expect some blemishes left in the carpet, but it wasn't bad. Also, this system did not work at all for me on squeaky steps. I don't know if the source of the problem was at fault rather than the kit, but I finally gave up. It's probably worth a shot to get this if you have a couple problem spots, but if it's widespread...not sure."
2,Do NOT purchase the extra bits and screws!!!,"The product image (shows only the adapter), lack of description, and the fact that they suggest a package deal with all three products is a scam. The kit already includes the bit and screws. You do not need 2 bits. You may need extra screws but the kit comes with plenty already."
1,Plenty of Squeeeks left,"I bought this for the squeaks both under my carpet and under my hardwood. I followed the directions exactly, and squeaks remain. The product simply doesn't work. One small area has a slightly less-irritating squeak, but it's definitely still there. I do not recommend buying this."
3,Good,"If you can isolate the loos floor boards and what they nail into this can solve your creaky floor. However, once I put these in the problem was only temporarily solved. A year later the floor creaks even more than it used to. Guess I'll just have to replace the old flooring."
5,Worked on my old house,"I have hardwood flooring installed in my oldish house, it was very squeaky. I tried this product out, and it worked well for me. Squeek No More is pretty easy to use if you have hardwood flooring since you don't have to worry about finding the joits(studs). It consisted of walking around to find the exact spot that creates the loudest squeak, step on the sides to put weight on it, drill the scored screw into the spot and break it off with the supplied gripping tool, finally fill in the small hole with a wood stick (I used Varathan Fill Stick). It fixed my squeaks, and the small hole it made after repairing is barely noticeable."
1,Didn't work for me...,"I didn't have as many problems fining the joists as other reviewers. There is a good This Old House video online that shows how to use a string to help mark lines once screws are properly placed at the ends of the joists.However after placing approximately 120 screws (over a two-hour period) in an area that is 4' x 8', the squeaks haven't stopped or even been any quieter. My house is 30 years old, so based off the other reviews I expected it to work. Oh well will tear up the carpet next...need new carpet anyways."
2,Didn't Work for Me...BUT....,"I tried this device with floors going back to the 1940s, and it just couldn't tighten the boards enough to make a big difference. Also, it's meant to be used for floors with carpets, and I was cutting away an old carpet and so the device wasn't much help. If you need to snap the tops of the screws off, that can be done with some pliers.The best and least expensive way to do this is to use an electric drill with a 1/8th drill bit to drill the holes. Once that's done, use an electric screwdriver to put the screws into the holes; then snap off the heads with pliers or, better, just leave them in. (I hate putting things in that I can't later remove if I need to.)All in all, the device is only handy if you don't have a drill or an electric screwdriver."
1,Didn't work,"This didn't stop the squeeky floors. Tried it in several locations and they still squeek. House was built in the late 1940's, so maybe it just is not made for these floors."
1,Didn't work for me,"I own a mobile home with a squeaky floor. I put all 50 screws into the joists and the squeak didn't change one bit. Maybe it works for other types of homes, but not mobile homes."
1,Kind of a pain...,"You think can do these home repairs yourself, then you try and well....Yep, I'd rather pay someone to fix things, than waste a little money here, and a little time there, on products that don't work, aren't as good as they say they are, and are not worth retuning. Save your money, and by next month, you'll have enough for materials, AND a handy man."
2,SQEEEEEK NO MORE KIT,Well-built product.Hard to get it done right if you are a home owner with average score on your handiness (like me!).Would not recommend this if you are not handy.
2,Did not fix the squeak.,I used this product as the directions stated and the floor continued and still continues to squeak. It was also hard to use and took a lot more screws they stated.
3,"Handyman says ""sort of works""","Saw this on youtube and loved the product demonstration. However, it's not a magic charm and will not work 100% of the time."
5,Eliminate squeaks easily,"I've used this successfully over high pile carpet to tighten down the subfloor and eliminate all squeaks in my bedroom. Please note that some squeaks can actually come from walls and not the floor. I found this out after using this product on my floor, had to install some screws on the wall/floor junction as well to eliminate that."
4,Partial success.,It quieted the squeaks resulting from floorboard moving up and down over loose nails. Just be mindful it will not quiet when butting edges of floorboard spanning the joists rub against each other.
4,Great Product,The product works as advertised. I used it on a 2nd story condo carpeted floor that had many squeaks in the floor. The toughest part is finding the joists underneath to screw into . Once you got them then you're good to go. It's a great product and it works well.
2,So so product,Work on some squeak but not all. Definitely need a lot of screws to fix one squeak. Now I have to fill up the crack and stain the patches. I a lot of work for something that doesn't work 100% of time. The nail does break when not intended too.
5,Awsome Kit,"For a long time we were frustrated with our floors in the bedroom, it was impossible to get off the bed with out a SQUEEK and waking up person who is still a sleep. But, finally I found this product which saved our sleep and marriage :). If you have squeaky floors I recommend to buy ""O Berry Enterprises 3233 Squeek No More"" Kit. Thank you Squeek No More."
5,Worked Great,"Product worked great, it took only one screw to solve the squeaky floor at the bottom of my stairs, much cheaper than having the carpet guy come back and pull back the carpet."
5,Amazing Peace,"Over the years, I have purchased and gifted several copies of the adult version of Amazing Peace: A Christmas Poem by Maya Angelou. I was very pleased to learn it was more recently illustrated as a children's book. The pictures are lovely and the words equally inspiring. It is a beautiful poem and a much needed message in our world. I gifted the book to many this holiday season as a reminder both to myself and others that peace begins within and that we can all be messengers of Amazing Peace!"
5,Amazing Peace,I first heard this poem when it was read on the Oprah Show by the author and the host. It was so moving and I think is it Ms. Angelou's best work. I purchased my copies to give as gifts to friends and to pass on the prayer for universal peace.
1,Kindle Edition - No pictures,Disappointed that there are no pictures with the Kindle edition. $10.00 for 300 words. Wished I had know that before ordering it.
4,This is a helpful book,"If you want to be truely successful with Zoo Tycoon 2, you should read this book. There were things I learned that worked WAY better than other things I tried myself. For example, who would have guessed that visitors find standing up in a gazebo more restful than sitting on a bench?!I will say that I am slightly annoyed that some of the more basic information that is in this book is not available with the literature that comes with the game. But I guess it is one more way of funding the game creation process (in the way that paying a parking ticket is a way of funding the good things that your local municipality does!!).But it really does help you make a zoo where the animals and the people are happy. :-)"
2,zoo tycoon 2 zookeepers collection,"My son loves the zoo tycoon games. The only problem is we do not know how to install it. It is not like other games you install. I put it in the disc drive and I see nothing!! Not sure where it is,we tried every possible folder. Would be a nice game if wwe knew how to install it."
4,great book!,"I normally try not to spend over 3.99 for any of my kindle books, but this series had me hooked. I don't remember what I paid for each book in the series but I looked forward to each of the books. I still haven't bought the last of this series, 'Zoe's Children'but am saving that for when I am facing a dearth of readable books and don't have the time to search more out. I enjoyed the premise of the book, enjoyed the character development (yes! there is character development!) especially over the subsequent books, and recommend this and the other books to anyone interested in good science fiction. Sorry I am not more analytical in my review of this book, but oh well, it's early in the morning and I just want to get this out and say try this book out..."
3,Yamabushi's mini reviews XVII,"this sequel to leagacy of heorot stumbles badly, and never captures the tension, excitement, imagery of the first book."
3,A disappointment,"From my favorite authors I expected better. They've tried to spice the work up by loading it with more sex than anything else they've done but this only made the rest of the text seem even paler and duller. I kept reading, thinking surely there's a pony in here, somewhere. After The Gripping Hand and now this I'll get their next work from the library."
1,"Terrible! Niven, how could you?","Until this book, I had never read a Niven book I didn't like. Ugh! Choppy writing, gratuitous sex, gratuitous violence, unlikeable characters, and a storyline that never went anywhere. The plot kept chasing its own tail. I lost interest about halfway through and had to force myself to finish it just to find out who gets killed by the end. And when I found out what happened, my response was, ""So what? That's all?"" Sex, gore, choppy writing, and lousy plot. Read _Ringworld_ or _The Integral Trees_ instead."
2,Doubt if Niven and Pournelle wrote much of this.,"This continuance of the excellent story of The Legacy of Heorot is a huge disappointment, full of editing errors and downright sloppy writing. I was amazed that I considered not finishing a book with Niven's name on the cover, but after the zillionth dredging up of sexual mores among the colonists and useless paragraphs devoted to coffee (which contained glaring factual errors), I was almost fed up. I don't believe Niven nor Pournelle had much to do with this project and that their names appear solely to command $4 per word from the publisher. Their respective writing styles are absent except for some obvious cut and paste operations, and the book is a dismal failure. Barnes is written all over this book and it shows"
5,"SF, Ecology, Biology, Sociology; a renaissance work!","True, there were a lot of editing errors in the book -- such as talk of the colonists being near the equator when the maps show the ""mainland"" as close to the north pole. But disregarding the sloppy editing I found this book to be one of the most overall entertaining works of SF I've ever read. The characterization is remarkable, the Avalon ecology well thought out and consistent, and the social interactions between factions grabs and keeps your interest. I felt myself cheering when the colonists achieved their goals, and sad when the main characters experienced tragedy. Thought provoking, adventurous, sexy... Hoping to see more works in this series"
4,At least as good as Legacy...,"I thought the book was a good read. First third was ok, the second third was good, and the final third was great. I thought there should have been more closure. There was a lot of repeated content. It seems to have been lengthened uneccesarily--Tim"
3,This book is a good follow on in the Heorot saga.,"The book is one of the poorest editing jobs I have read.Niven has taken us back to the Tau Ceti system for anotherencounter with those fun loving grendels. This book haseven more surprises in store for us as the progeny of theFirsts attempt to tame Avalon from their base on CamelotIsland. The story is as usual with Niven, Pournell, andBarnes excellent in its construction and leaves the futureopen for an additional sequel. The only problem with thebook is the pathetic job of editing done. There are dozensof places where words are misspelled or the wrong word isused. In most cases you can decipher what is intended,but it makes the reading less fluid. Thank the grendel godthat I borrowed this book from the library rather than spendingmy money on it!"
2,Nothing but an interlude...,"I am a big fan of Niven/Pournelle/Barnes, however this book really was nothing more than a long and only somewhat entertaining interlude in the Legacy series. I was extremely disappointed with the ending and it was even more disappointing not to find another sequel. If this is truly the end, don't bother. If there is ever a final book to finish a trilogy, this book may be worth reading to get to the end of the story, but as it is, it leaves you hanging with a lousy ending with more new questions than answers.It was so disappointing that it almost makes me sorry that I started the series. I really hope that the authors will come up with a fantastic book that really closes everything up, but since it may never come, I recommend anyone considering this book (plus Legacy) to wait to buy it until (if) a final sequel comes out - otherwise you will be as disappointed as I am."
2,Beowulf's Children lacks the punch of Legacy of Heorot,"The sequel to Legacy of Heorot(LOH), takes you back to Avalon 25 years after the Grendel Wars. The community is split between the orginal settlers and the ""Star Born"". This rift is evident during the novel, and only gets larger. The colonists finally take a step to settle the mainland, in which they meet a deadly new ""Avalon Surprise"". Unfortunately, this book lacks the raw intensity and power of LOH. The book plays more on social structures and issues. On the positive side, the book does create an intersting new threat found on Avalon, and makes you wonder if there will be a sequel."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This is the sequel to the former Legacy of Heorot novel, also called the Dragons of Heorot, I think, and unfortunately it is not as interesting.The older generation begin to have health problems from all that they have endured, so a serious generation gap develops between those born locally, and those not.So, the book mostly is about the difference in cultural attitudes between the two, and the new kids wanting to go their own way."
1,WHAT'S UP WIT' DAT?!!!,"This book was a real let down. After being completely impressed and blown away by ""The Legacy of Heorot"" I had expected great things from this sequel. Pffft...not even close. There are so many more directions that this story could have gone. Imagine a world where religious cults worshipped the grendels and it was a right of passage to sacrifice oneself to the beasts...This one was written to take a few more dollars from hopeful readers without having to put in the effort of giving them something back for their investment. Don't bother!"
3,There have been better,"The development of Avalon ecology is interesting, but the characters are flat. Plot could have used some thickening. I think the best read is Footfall."
1,1989 Mustang electric fan #67015,"With this fan hooked up my motor was on the edge of over heating and it was 70 degrees out. Also after the second week the fan quit working and I cant find anywhere to get it fixed. Not that I want it fixed I want my money back. Well, if you read the fine print they give you a percent of your money back minus shipping from them to you and minus shipping it back to them.Horrible product DONT BUY !"
1,Proform 67015 - Bad Design,"This fan would be great if the temperature probe was not so fragile. I order this fan and when it arrived the temperature probe was broken off of the capillary tube. Amazon sent me a replacement fan and it arrived with the exact same problem, so after two fans I decided to go with the Flex-a-Lite it is a much better design - the tube is a thicker gauge unlike the proform. Anyone who tells you they are the same product just in a different box is a liar. DO NOT BUY PROFORM 67015 UNLESS YOU PLAN ON RETURNING IT!"
3,"Was a sampler for 1985, pointless picking it up now","Don't get this, two of the songs are on 1985, so get that, and just download don't hate me. These songs are slightly more mainstream than the ones on perhaps i suppose but they still sound great."
3,new ep,"after listening to this ep a fews times i just decided that its great work and great music, but it is just lacking something the last c-d had. i am still looking forward to the full length in june. to sum it up if u are a big lover of rufio u will enjoy it, if u are not a big lover and u just like them a little then i would suggest testing it out before buying."
2,rufio!,"I loved Rufio's sound and overall energy on their old CD (Perhaps I Suppose). However, this CD seemed to lack some of that energy - which was a disappointment. Also, a heads up to reviewer David Samaniego...middle school girls can be one of Rufio's original fans, okay? So instead of trying to be too cool for yourself, maybe you should learn how to spell words like ""original""."
3,the new Ep,"yeah well i liked the ep alot, but it just didn't have what the old c-d had i dunno there is just something missing from it, but i still can't wait for the full length in june. to sum it up its a must have if u are already a rufio fan, but if your not i would suggest trying it out before buying."
2,great work.......but not what I expected......,"I couldnt wait for this cd to come out and i was very curious to see what they would put out next, but when i bought this cd i was quite disapointed because it was nothing like there old cd(perhaps i suppose). Dont get me wrong this is a great cd and still has there great instrument work, and i give them all the credit in the world for that, but its just not the same pop-punk style as all of there previous work, and dosent have half as much energy as there old songs like above me, in my eyes, and dip****. Well im sure alot of there very first origional fans like me are disapointed but all of the trendy middle school girls are eating it up."
1,Not for me!,"This was crap. It smelled really nice but that's about it. Maybe it just didn't work for my hair type. If you have thick relaxed African American hair, or you're a natural with low porosity I would not recommend it at all. I think my hair just needs sulfates because this really just sat on top of my hair and I dont feel like it got clean enough."
1,makes my relaxed hair dry and coarse,"This shampoo overdries my relaxed hair dry and coarse the minute it touches it, and so tangled it's unbelievable. This is the 1st time ever a shampoo does this to me. I wanted to try a different sulphate-free product as I've tried Organix and those are very gentle and detangling, but Burt's Bees is maybe for another type of hair, maybe hair that's not chemically processed."
2,Very Harsh,"I like that this shampoo is all natural, that's why I purchased it and the reason that I'm giving it 2 stars. However, it is harsh, strips my hair and doesn't create shine as claimed. I also don't like the smell. It's a bitter, grapefruit smell and isn't pleasant at all. I'm really disappointed with this shampoo. Burt's Bees usually has good products but this one missed the mark."
3,Burt's Bees shampoo...,"I gave this product a rating of three, because it weighs my hair down. It has a really nice scent and lathers well, but I prefer the Aubrey Camomile Luxurious Volumizing shampoo, as it gives my hair more body and bounce. I have been using this shampoo as a hand soap, and it does smell nice, but do not like it for a shampoo."
1,Do you want your hair to smell like Grapefruit and Sugarbeets?,"Where do I start with Burt? He seems like an alright guy since he looks one of my favorite wrestlers of all time Hillbilly Jim!Man, when him and his whole family including Uncle Elmer and cousin Luke would come out to ""Don't Go Messing With a Country Boy"" I would throw my cereal bowl across the room and start square dancing. My momma thought I was insane since I was by myself but what an inspiration he was!Back to Burt Bee.I will make this one pretty easy for you and my spell check button.I would like to ask the men a question.Do you want your hair to smell like Grapefruit and Sugarbeets?I didn't think so! Go buy some Pert!This has been Ronny Tucker with Hillbilly Hygiene saying ""Free don't mean free unless you are drinking out of a lake"""
3,Dry when wet,"I was so excited to use my new shampoo...i got it in the shower and put it in my hair...it made my hair feel brittle.After i got out and my hair dried, my hair was for sure shiney, but i think that this shampoo is better as a clarifying shampoo for build-up...not for everyday use. :)"
2,ho-hum.,"definitely not very volumizing. i think this cleans hair well, but that's about all that i liked about it and i've definitely gotten a clean as good or better with different products with a much better total outcome. this shampoo left my hair feeling a little dry and unmanageable and certainly not soft. i did give my hair time to get used to the product as some other users/reviewers had suggested in hopes that i'd get better results but time did not make it any better. i enjoy using natural products, but this simply is not a very good one. also, the smell is delightful in small doses but over time it seems to be too rich. you know what i like better? yes to carrots products. highly recommended."
1,"Dull, Brittle and Flat hair","If you want dull, brittle and flat hair this is the perfect shampoo for use. It is full of chemicals and will strip you hair of all life making it dull, brittle, and flat. My wife thought that her hair dyes were destroying her hair. It was not the hair dyes it was this shampoo. Avoid this shampoo; it is the worst. It is full of soy, GMOs, harmful chemicals and who knows what else. This used to be a great shampoo. Too bad the Clorox corporation destroyed it when they bought Burt's Bees.We switched to J.R. Liggett's shampoo bars. My wife's hair completely changed after using J.R. Liggett only once. Now her hair is fluffy, soft, and bouncy."
2,Dry,"I bought this shampoo (and it's matching conditioner) a few months ago because they were on clearance at Target. I just started using it. The shampoo WILL lather if you rub it in your hands first. However, my hair is SO dry. At first it was a bit oily (I don't think i was rinsing it out well enough since it does seem a bit thicker than other shampoos I have used). I decided to stick it out and see if it got better. My hair does look clean for longer than most shampoo/conditions I've used. However, my hair is tangly and dry all the time, including immediately after I get out of the shower. I would not recommend this product.Just for info: I have fine, straight hair. It has never been dry, although every once in awhile it can get oily. It might be better suited for other hair types."
3,A little stiff and a little heavy,They will take some time to get comfortable. Well made though and the soles are almost boot like. They will last a long time I would suspect.
3,"Beautiful old book with a lot of great music, but missing the violin part pullout","This is great old book with a nice old fashioned cloth binding. The music is also great -- lots of famous songs from classical era. I give it 3 stars because I was expecting for it to come with a separate pullout with the violin part, which unfortunately it does not. This item is perfect if you want to play the just piano accompaniment."
2,"Quality is nice, but there are some issues.","I bought 3 pairs of these cables to make a 6 channel bundle to go from my blu-ray player into the surround processor. The quality seems very nice, and I like the braided covering over the wires.What I don't really like about them is:The ends fit WAY too tight into the RCA connections. I had to be very careful to twist and push them in, because I heard the circuit board cracking on my Rotel RSP-1066 as I connected them."
5,If you are supporting a depressed person read this,This book is so good. It has changed the way I focus on the issues of depression. I feel empowered by reading this book.Marj Noble
5,Ahhhhh Good Game,A couple years ago i use to play this game on a ps2 but i gave to to my big brother so he would have something to do so I have been playing the wii and my friend told me that he has been playing this game on game cube. 2 years later and I bought it and I am enjoying this game. It came perfect and every feature of the disc works.(isolditlongisland) is where i got it from
5,NFS Most Wanted,"Whoo! What a fun game. NFS previous games were fun, kinda slow, but fun. This one is NFS 2 on crack! Me and my sons (13 & 21) fought over who got to play and when! Faster paced and sooooo much fun. This time you get to destroy stuff, get chased by the cops (constantly) and trying not to get busted and your car impounded all while playing the regular race ladder at the same time. Surprisingly easy to play once you get the hang of it. Enjoyed it very much. We all have."
4,Good Game,This is the best Need For Speed Game made because the cops are like bees on u! So get this game and u will be truly satisfied!!
2,Not what I expected,"When I first heard aboyt this game I thought that it would rock. I am very disappointed. In underground and underground 2 they had great cars and many parts. This not so much and also most wanted only has expensive luxury cars or imports thet look hot but are not. Although I like the cop twist and unlike the first hot pursuit game electronic arts developed, Need For Speed Hot Pursuit, the cops follow even after the finish line. But to what extent to lose hot cars for better chases and fewer upgrade parts. If you wnat a pursuit game that rocks get this one, If you want to race with a car that you see in america do not buy this game"
2,Was good while it lasted,This teapot was very good for the first year of its use. Now it has rusted where the solder joint is for the spout to connect to the base. It leaks tea out of the bottom of the spout now. We are really disappointed.
2,Advertised MIU 1.5 quart is only 1 liter,"This tea pot is only 1 liter, not 1.5 quarts as advertised. (=1.4 Liters) Everyone is very confused on the volume when questioned. Liters are very close to quarts so I can't see what the confusion is or where it was initiated, but it continues to be an incorrectly advertized volume so be aware.Otherwise, it is a very well built and well pouring tea pot that does not dribble at the spout, very natural to hold and pour."
4,B. Explores Themes of Societal Insulation and Evil as Chaos,"Meeting Evil is a great book. In it (like in Neighbors and The Houseguest) Berger explores the themes of the limits of hospitality and the shield of insulation that we as members of society build around ourselves. However, in this novel, Berger uses the character of Ritchie to explore the nature of Evil more than he does with any other character. Ritchie's motivations are random and surreal and chaotic in contrast to the overly orderly and logical John Felton. It is as if Berger purposely makes Ritchie as illogical as possible while simultaneously showing John (and the reader)to be completely unprepared to deal with or understand him. Preparation requires logic, and logic is useless in dealing with chaos. Ritchie does not seem as sinister as he does chaotic."
3,Required Reading,"I was required to read this book for a literature class and found it interesting. I was not ""hooked"" throughout the book, however it did have some ""dark humor"" as it went on. This was my first book, therefore first impression, on Thomas Berger and I was not overly impressed. I am interested to read more of his work to see if I can see any similarities."
3,interesting,"It is one of the few books that was not as good as the movie in my opinion, but it was a fun read"
5,One of the Best Putting Books in a Long Time,"Todd Sones' book is right up there with the greatest putting books of all time -- George Low's The Master of Putting, Dave Stockton's Putt to Win, and Arnold Palmer's Complete Book of Putting. Sones is two-time Illinois PGA Teacher of the year and a Golf Magazine Top 100 Teacher in America. Like Rik DeGunther in his Art and Science of Putting, Sones tells you what works best and how you can do it. The writing is clear, and the explanation suits the general golfing public. This book is much better than a book like Dave Pelz's Putting Bible, where you get tons of stats about how average putters don't putt so well, and next to nothing actually useful by way of HOW to putt (other than to buy Pelz's gizmos). Sones goes to the heart of the matter every time, teaching the optimal techniques in terms the average golfer can apply daily. That's what teaching is really all about! Great job, Todd! ..."
3,Fun & Simple,"If you love puzzles, this is a fun and simple game to purchase to pass time or take on a train/plane. It's challenging yet easy to start playing without needing directions, etc. Great for all ages. My stepdaughter loves it."
2,Just OK,"I thought this would be more fun, but it just didn't grab my interest and I hardly ever play this. I was disappointed because I really love word games. So, I give this a ""just Ok"" rating."
5,Great find for great price,Been looking for this cd for a long time. Found it here for a great I mean really grat price. CD arrived promptly and melody is great.
3,Hoover U5272-RM Review,"The things I don't like about the Hoover are the noise...it's pretty loud, and the cord is too short. Also, it doesn't pick up the dog hair very well in the carpet. I think next time I'd spend a little extra and get a better vacuum cleaner."
4,Liked it a lot,"A nice study of characters & culture. I spent a good deal of the book cringing watching the stress exerted on the characters squeeze out dark behavior. While I was rooting for them to find strength, I couldn't blame them when they didn't."
4,Read it in Arabic,"I read this Novel in Arabic and it's excellent, even the translation was excellent , Not my type of novel as it involve poltics but I find it capturing novel :)"
5,A well-written and powerful story,"This very powerful and touching novel is not only revealing but also opens our minds to more questions, the most powerful of which is the problem of freedom in a land haunted by limited civil liberties and the strong man, a diseases that is still plaguing Africa today. It draws on the powerful theme of oppression and the yearning for liberation that I also saw inTriple Agent, Double Cross,which explains a lot of things about Africa. We get a vivid picture of living in unfree societies that are enriched by citizens that are yearning for freedom.The situation in Libya today is well heralded in this book. After all, it is the land of Omar Mukhtar that fought the Italian colonizers for nearly twenty years. Deep within the people is an almost unbreakable spirit that we are seeing today."
3,"Technically, well done.","The novel's theme is accommodation vs. integrity, taking place in Libya as Khadafy is consolidating his power. Technically the work is nicely done, but I cannot muster any enthusiasm for it. It is told through the eyes of a 9 year old. Matar employs adult language, but maintains the sensibility of a child in his narration. Perhaps because of this, Mata does not do enough with his adult characters. Also, the attempted resistance comes across as so nave."
4,A quick read about Lybia,"I read this over a weekend. This poor boy is lost with what is happening in his country, his mother medicating herself and father in his own world... this child becomes codependent and tries to please others. No one stops and talks to this child and the one that does is a ""bad man""Who is a fault? Mother? Father? Government? All the above? What can be taken from this may be the importance of standing back and communicating with children especially in the hard times. He was somewhat forgotten. You feel the emptiness in his adulthood."
2,Going nowhere,"This book was an excursion to nowhere. I did not feel it gave a great sense of country and there was not much of a story. In the last few months I have read ""What is the What"", (a great book), ""A Long Way Gone"" and ""Don't Let's Not Go To The Dogs Tonight"", all set in Africa, and they all gave the reader a great feel of the countries in which there were set.They also had a more interesting story progression, although they were more autobiographical. I never got a great feel for Libya in this book. Try another book."
1,Really boring; doesn't get to the point,I had to put this down after 100 pages; the author spends endless descriptions of mundane events through a boy's eyes without getting to the point; the first 100 pages appear to be the lead-up to something better but could have been condensed to 10 without losing a thing;
4,Very well written!!,"I enjoyed this book; however, it is one that you must concentrate on every word. A little slow moving and yet very interesting perspective on the life in Libya in the late 70's and early 80's. Very interesting to me was the fact that this story was as seen through the eyes of a 9 year old. Having a 9 year old of my own, really related the significance of this story to me personally."
4,National and Family Repression Through the Eyes of a Child,"An interesting look at a Libyan family in 1979 through the eyes of the nine year old narrator, Suleiman. The novel shows what it was like to live in a completely male dominated society during the first decade of Khadafy's reign. Suleiman lives with his business-traveling father and a mother with some serious emotional issues. As his neighbor and possibly his father get caught up in the revolution movement, Suleiman learns what it is like to live in a repressive society.I enjoyed this novel, and how the author explored the family dynamics of a Muslim family in Libya at this moment in time. There is a lot packed into this thin novel, including the struggles of Suleiman to reconcile his parent's shortcomings with his view of how adults, specifically fathers and mothers, should behave. It doesn't always have an even flow, but still a very strong effort."
5,Remarkable!,I occasionally see someone so clumsy that I think to myself how lucky everyone is that they don't do heart surgery. Reading In the Country of Men reminds me that I should be very thankful that I never aspired to becoming an author. The craftsmanship that Mr. Matar displays throughout this book is simply humbling. I can't write well enough to do it justice. I can only suggest that you buy it and see for yourself.
5,book club choice,"Not a typical book club pick because this is a book that I will keep and pass on. Libya's version of To Kill a Mockingbird.I learned about the author from an email sent by Bidoun, an arts magazine. The author was invited to speak and becauseI couldn't make it, decided to order his book. Soooo glad I did. Thanks Amazon. Anybody know if it's available in Libya today?????"
4,Does what it is supposed to,There's nothing fancy about this notebook case. But that's exactly why I bought it and why I am hapy with it.We use our laptop quite a bit from the couch and this case definitely keeps prolonged laptop use from being a painful affair. And when you are ready to shut it down and move it out of the way the whole thing zips up and is easy to carry elsewhere.If you are looking for a case that is machine washable and protects you from the crotch searing heat of today's laptops then take a chance on thie Belkin Sleeve Top.
2,Gets dirty easy,"I still use this but it gets dirty easy and I don't carry a computer in it any more, just a batch of cables. It looked good and was cheap, but not such a great idea, sorry Belkin, you have a lot of better products, this one is in the also ran category. Not a bad product, just an also ran that gets dirty easy."
1,One of the worst quality treadmill,"Don't be fooled by the advertisement and its warrantee statement. I 3 bought this treadmill 3 years ago. And now its controller boad is broken. Guess what, the electronics part only has 3 year warrantee. And it will cost you more than $350. And worse yet, smoothfiness customer service has bad attitude. After 2 months of repair, it is still not repaired. The parts they sent me are all broken after 2-3 hours of running. The customer service department has no clue how to fix it. Now, after 2 months, the treadmill is still not fixed.So if you think you have the patience to deal with the bad quality product then go ahead and buy it. Otherwise I suggest look around and find other product."
1,False Advertising,"The item is listed as:""3M Marine Adhesive/Sealant Fast Cure 5200, 05220, White, 3 oz. (Case of 6)."" However, when I placed my order, I only received one, not a ""case of six."" Not the deal I expected. Probably could find it cheaper somewhere else."
5,A FANTASTIC BOOK!,"I thought this book, Gift Horse was a great book and one of the best Saddle Club books yet! I am a huge fan of all the Saddle Club books, even if this is only the fourth one I have read. My friends reccomended it to me a long time ago, and I just got around to reading it. It really is a wonderful book and I reccomend it to anyone who loves horses and adventure! In this book, Stevie trys to compete with No-Name one last time before the snooty, Chelsea Webber takes her away from her. What must Stevie do to ride her beloved mare one last time? You will have to read the book to find out! It is really good! Keep up the good work Bonnie Bryant!"
5,"Eartha Kitt, Cool Cover!!","I don't know much about Eartha, this is the first album I own of hers. Typical of the ""MasterSong"" label(Cheap), only cover art and track listing, I have no idea when these tracks were recorded. Several of the tracks are live, the jazz band backing her are tight, good horns and piano, a nice clear and crisp recording."
4,Good American Black Metal,Summon are a great black metal band from Michigan. I already own 2 of their cds and this newer release is just a heavy as the others. Good raw evilness. I recommend this cd of blasphemous metal onslaught. Long live metal!!!
3,Th story of an ultra-rare Wurger.,"You've got to be a WW2 aviation enthusiast to appreciate this reference work, otherwise it's a bit dry. The ""Wurger"" name means ""butcher bird"" and describes this aircraft type's efficiency as a bomber killer. This model was an advanced model which was among the finest fighter planes of the war, if not the best. At war's end, the ""yellow 10"" was brought to the U.S. and eventually fell on hard times. It's low point was sitting out in the open, vulnerable to the elements and severe vandalism. The story of it's resurrection to the star display at a fighter museum is well documented. But you've go to enjoy the details! 89 pages and lots of very good photographs (both wartime and restoration process), mostly B & W though."
1,Great Game but Sucks on Intel Macs!,"I used to play this game all the time on my power pc iMac and recently bought it for my MacBook Pro and it ran slow as a mother! I was super bummed because I've got 256mb of vram and 4gb of system ram. Unfortunately and I hate to say this, stay away if you've got an intel mac!"
2,"Runs like crap on the Mac, and forget multiplayer","The game seems fun, but it runs crappy on my Intel Macbook Pro, and there's no one online to play against. I've had the game randomly crash so much, I ened up just tossing the game in a box and forgetting about.I would recommend it for a PC, but not on a Mac."
5,A lot of fun,"Very funny, it's pleasant to get a game as this one. I'm already waiting for the new edition pack.About Freezing, At the beginning."
1,Freezes Up for no good Reason,"The game looks good. But, it doesn't run well. It is seriously buggy.On a G4 with 1Gb of memory running 10.2.8, the game starts up, but then freezes when I attempt to lay track. Contacted MacSoft, looked up bugs on their site --- NOTHING. It would be great if it worked."
4,Fun but better games out there.,"My son says the game is fun, but not as good as StarCraft or Age of Mythology."
2,Beware on OSX LION,"This a great game. In my opinion one of the best out there. It does, however, not run on OSX Lion because they've dropped support for powerpc games. Make you find a game that can play on an intel based mac before buying. I have to install snow leopard again if I want to play it."
4,early poems,"This collection was privately published while Morrison was still alive. It contains his early poetry, full of epigrams and philosophical fragments of observation on film, sex, mysticism, night-life, and society, among other things. I think it's his best and most readable poetry.David Rehakauthor of ""Poems From My Bleeding Heart"""
4,"""Destroy Roofs, Walls, See In All The Rooms At Once""","Jim Morrison is one of the unsung heroes of his generation in the literary scene. But, his poems are just as good, if not greater. Surprisingly, his poetic style is different from his lyric style. There is no rhyme scheme, and all his works are direct thoughts. All are perceptive of our society, and its imperfections. My only problem with this book is that the publisher granted an entire page to one poem, which may only be two lines long. Although, this may be good for the individual who is into taking notes, and hanging upon Morrison's every word. This does help, because his poems require intense meditation. I find that each phrase, and each verse can have as many as five different meanings. They can be taken literally, or as he would've meant, on the metaphorical level. In short, if you are a fan of his work with the Doors, or have an interest in Beat Literature, then this is the book for you. Prepare to be blown away!"
3,I love Jim Morrison but this is too much...,"I can understand that people who are so into Morrison could read this and walk away feeling like they've been blessed and enlightened by the greatest poet they've ever read, BUT, c'mon. This stuff isn't really all that good. Bits and Fragments of thoughts abound, nothing really cohesive throughout. Jim talks alot about his views of cinema and society as some monster of its own free will. Fans should seriously check out Wilderness and American Night, as well as the American Prayer CD. All of which are much more understandable and, not to mention, enjoyable to have. Add this one to the collection though. It is Jimmy darnit. But, if you want real poetry, get the Doors illustrated lyrics book. Now THAT's some real good writin'!"
5,jim is god.,"jim was THE best poet of this century. not to mention the founder of modern rock and roll. his early death was a tragic loss for mankind. but his music and his words live on thru books like this and the music of the doors. someday jim will be revered as shakespeare, frost, dante, or rumi. he was way above their league..."
5,I am the lizard king I can do anything,I am 14. I have not read this book but i would like to jim morrison i think is one of the best writers ever . decide for your self if you like the book don't go on some one elses opinion exspecially mine. i like the doors
1,Puerile maunderings of a nearly talentless narcissist,"These ""poems"" are so bad, so puerile, so schlocky, so self-indulgent, that it is no wonder that thousands of disturbed teenagers carry them around clutched to their chests. Morrison speaks for the all the disaffected but talentless millions who ever lived. His thoughts are their thoughts; his pointless word-salads apparently strike deep, thrilling chords of banality in the unthinking. Don't read the book; read the other reviews of it posted here, and you will get the full flavor of the Morrison ""mystique."""
4,"fantastic book, borrowing heavily from blake and rimbaud","Unfortunately your day-glo electric cover was so ugly i carved it off with an exacto knife so i wouldn't have to look at the pseudo-acid-y colors. The original edition, now no longer available had a much more interesting cover and didn't use his doors fame as much to sell the book."
4,read it in one night,"morrison's first collection of poetry shows that not only was he a talented musician, but also a first rate poet. divided into two sections, the lords (the first) and the new creatures (the second), some of the greatest lines i've read come from here. the poems in the lords seem to lead into the next one. excellent read. i can't go on enough about this."
5,Astonishing,"I happen to own all 3 Apocalyptica albums, and this is their finest yet. They finaly decided to make the huge step, write their own music instead of playing some metallica songs like in metallica by four cellos(awesome album too,dont get me wrong). Now maybe the time has come for metallica to play apocalyptica songs?To cut a long story short, dont just buy the normal edition, get the special edition,it deserves every nicle of its price"
1,"I pay this item in 7/25/11,and they no send to me the perfum","I dont know the problem,but I bay this item in 7/25/11,and today,I dont know where its my perfum............this seeler its very irresponsable"
4,"Generally great, but loses steam as it wears on","A fabulous look at the world of oil. Margonelli educates the reader and debunks commonly held beliefs by taking you on a trip backward through the petro supply chain. Her writing style is interesting and highly illustrative, and the insights she draws from her observations make the book initially hard to put down.As the book takes her overseas, however, the insights start to wear thin and the text starts to drag on. In fact, I still haven't finished the book in its entirety, but what I learned in the first 100 pages was enough to make it well worth the cover price."
4,"A worthy effort, but somewhat superficial","Margonelli's book is worth your time to read, but don't expect to come away with a DEEP understanding of oil ""from the pump to the pipeline."" More conversational than exploratory, this book will appeal to those who enjoy a good story more than an in-depth analysis."
4,Excellent Read,"Kudos to Lisa Margonelli - A interpersonal tour de force of the global petroleum industry from the corner gas station to the far reaches of the globe. Despite a few typos and a little errata here and there (in one spot billion is confused with million, minus one star) this is very much worth reading for anyone interested in the past, present, and future of the global petroleum industry. Score : 4/5. Cheers."
5,Insightful,"This was an absolutely great book. I was a little nervous about it. Expecting it to be pretty boring and borderline conspiracy theory-ish. It was anything but. It was honestly one of the most informative, engaging books I've read in a while. Not once was I bored while reading it. And I really feel like I learned a whole lot. The author basically lays out the process of how we get our oil. Starting with the pump and working backwards towards the refineries, derricks, and pipelines. She even spends time discussing 5 countries that are (re)shaping the oil industry. The book is super-balanced (which I honestly was hoping it would give me reasons to boycott gas companies that I already mega-loathe). She is fair. Honest. And extremely insightful. The stories of the workers from the countries like Venezuela, Iran, and Niger are heart breaking. Realizing that my constant ""being on the go"" is so far removed from their poverty."
4,"Good, but not great -","I am a big Jennings fan, but after finishing all 3 books in the Spangle series, I can't help but feel there was something missing. I enjoyed the story, and the history, but maybe got confused with some of the characters. If you are a fan of historical fiction or Gary Jennings you should read this saga...."
3,Another licks DVD,"Ya, we get to learn another group of lics. Wow, anyone know a good dvd or book to actually teach you theory of Rockabilly?Ya, you learn a bassline riff, a solo, and a couple of other things, big whoop. You won't be able to understand how to come up with your own licks or theory for innovation."
2,Terrible,"Horrible acting and dumb sound effects make this film completely unwatchable. The movie is full of crude humor and tired cliches. I've seen worse, but I cannot recommend this unless you are a die hard BD Wong fan (he does look good in a speedo, hence the extra star) or Bronson Pinchot fan and are adding this to your collection of their work. Otherwise, do not waste your time with this utter trash."
4,Very funny film,My daughter loved this movie as a kid and wanted to see it again. The used condition is still great - no imperfections in viewing and she was thrilled with a classic gift!
3,Eeeeh its decent,"The movie was sort scratchy, in the beginning it skipped like 30 secs but other than that it was ok, funny movie."
4,Classic stupid fun,"Classic stupid fun. To watch B.D. Wong on Law and Order then remember him in the ""root suit"" on Slappy is too much! A movie with a plot? Not this one. A great movie to watch with kids? This is the one."
5,A Great Kid's Movie,"I bought this movie for my younger sister, who is eight, and she just loves it. Even the grown-ups laugh along with this movie."
4,"Six year old son loved it. No bad language, minimal violence","For Kids only. My son (5) and daughter (3) wanted to watch it every day. As a parent I liked the minimum of violence and the portrayal of kids who can follow thier imaginations. It was easy to relate to my kids that the STINKERS worked as a solid team and shared responsibilities and ideas. No arguing, no ""me first"" , no pushing , no shoving , no designer clothes. A movie that impresses upon my son that being a kid should be fun and to use your imagination."
2,it's no Free Willy,"We picked up this movie at a garage sale, and I am SO GLAD I only paid a dollar. I really feel I should get a refund though, and maybe some payment for time lost! The plot line is SO contrived (oh look at the poor sea lion, he looks so sad, we should save him and release him to the sea). Free Willy it ain't! The acting is abysmal, and don't get me started on the fake accents!! *shudder*I gave it 2 stars instead of one because the kids had some laughs. However with the basic premise that kids should defy adults because they are all stupid, incompetent, and/or evil I think there are MUCH better family films out there to get your chuckles."
5,Nice size board,"Very nice size and a lot better than expected,It has rubber on the bottom of feet that keeps it from slipping and leaves no marks,also sits about and inch and a half up higher because of the feet on it, and is heavy .No wobble at all,if you have had cutting boards that are not to thick and kinda of small ,you will feel like you can chop wood when you get this board"
3,IF YOU ARE DIE HARD FAN YOU WOULD HAVE THESE,"Even a die hard fan would already have these in their collection, and remastered. I love what Concrete Blonde had done over the years, but I would be hoping more for a box-set including rarities and whatever other gems they have accomplished. This is a great re-introduction set for those who knew Concrete Blonde but want to get re-acquainted with their material and artistry. For me there is so much more that could be packed into an ""Esstential"" collection, this doesn't even touch the surface."
1,Book title is misleading,"This book has a relatively small section on speed-reading, which I find strange considering the book's title. It's a great book -- for taking notes and reading for classes -- but not for speed reading. The title should be changed since there's not much emphasis on speed reading."
4,Very comfortable,"If you wear a mask a lot as I do, these are worth the money.They are very comfortable. I can wear them all day and pretty much forget I have one on.The straps are a little funky, but I figured out my own improvement with the help of a small piece of duct tape."
4,Gorgeous Bible,"I was a little disappointed that there weren't reference verses down the middle of each page but that is my fault for not making sure of it prior to purchase. I love the NASB version of the bible. My FMS made it difficult for me to carry a big study bible to church with me. So, this is the perfect size."
5,Nice Bible,Very good Bible for the cost. The leather binding is beautiful and its a great size for a bible and still has decent sized print.
4,Great Bible for Taking with You,"I now have two of this same bible. It has everything I like in my bible (e.g., red lettering, no tabs, no center references). It's small enough to be handy and not too small to read (when your eyesight is starting to go). I also like how the leather feels to the touch. I keep one by my chair and have the other for when I travel."
3,Zondervan's Thinline NASB Bible,"I was looking for a personal size NASB to carry around with me. I originally purchased the NASB Compact Reference Bible. The problem with it is that it is smaller than what I would have liked for it to be. So, I searched for a Bible the size of which would suit my needs. After comparing the size of this Bible with the one I originally purchased, I decided to buy it. The size is perfect. I enjoy reading and studying the NASB translation. This is a text only Bible with a partial concordance. But, the material that it is constructed of is second-rate. The paper and the guilding remind of the Bibles that are leatherette and cost between one and five dollars. True, you purchase books and the Bible in particular to be read, but you should also expect quality in your purchase."
5,Best translation in great format,"NASB is now my favorite translation, because it is word -for - word literal. I was looking for it in the thinline format and this was my favorite choice."
5,Bible Readers,It is the Bible I carry on most of my Bible Studies. Thus far it fulfilled every expectation. Very handy size to carry.
5,NASB thinline bible.. brown/blue cover,"I purchased this Bible yesterday in the Italian Duo Tone blue and brown leather. The binding is sewn and of good quality. The cover feels soft and suede like, and the book is comfortable to hold. It lays flat when opened to the middle, however will probably take a bit of breaking in for the whole thing to lay flat when opened.There is a concordance in the back as well as some pages with scriptures for when you need encouragement, are feeling down, etc.This is not a reference Bible, but just the good old Word, which I am finding nice. Over all I am very please with my purchase. This is a great Bible."
5,Handy and small Bible,Excellent little slimline Bible but it does have small print. Not for the seeing impaired. Easy to carry and great for travel.
5,What We Like We Make,"whoa.. This CD has to be one of my favorites of this year. The song, ""Skies So Blue"", was recommended to me by a friend and I just loved it. So after hearing the rest of the songs, I realized that it wasn't just one song that was good. It was the whole CD. I must say that I wish more people had heard of it and I've been doing my best to spread the word about The Rocket Summer. Not enough good things can be said about this album. Request the songs at your local radio stations. Request the video on MTV. Beg your parents to buy you the CD and if you're old enough, go out and get the CD yourself. Well, worth the price of 15 dollars in the age of free downloads."
2,umm....no.,"First i have to say that it is pretty amazing that Bryce plays every instrument on this CD, but he should of spent more time coming up with better lyrics, honestly an eleven year old could of written the the album as good or better then he did. This is a good CD to play if your cleaning your room, or you just want something in the backround while youre doing your homework or whatnot. But if you are like me, and appreciate good lyrics then you probably wouldnt want this CD."
1,What the f**k is this?!?!?!?!,i recently saw this band supporting the ataris on their recent uk tour and i had to warn people do NOT listen to this band as they are the worst band in the world. Even after seeing them live i thought id give a second chance to redeem themselves but after listening to their albumn their even worse. in conclusion.....SAVE YOUR MONEY DO NOT TOUCH THIS ALBUMN!!
1,Misleading/rip off,"This offer is only for ONE bowl for the price of $17 at the time?I could buy a whole corelle set of 4 big plates 4 little plates 4 glasses and 4 bowls for $52.Asking or $17 for ONE BOWL is just outrageous!At the time there were no indication that this was just for 1 and not 4 (which would make more sense.)For now on, I will never assume that I am getting what i'm asking for (within the logical amount the price is set for.)"
4,Faster,"NFSU2 was a good game, with a lot of races, challenges and cars. An a lot of tuning. NFSMW is a good game with new cars and challenges.PROS:New cars like Lamborghini Gallardo and MurcielagoFaster carsPolice pursuitsJosie MaranCONS:Police pursuits can be long and annoyingFew vynils and pieces for tuning, you have to unlock themThe sensation of speed is unreal, even when your car has the best of the best to runNo SUV'S"
3,Stressful to the MAX!,"I bought this game on a whim, having really liked Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. This game needs help. First of all, the frame rate is lower than it should be. There is slow-down as well. Even the game before this, Need For Speed: Underground 2 looked 100 times better. The car models in Most Wanted are a touch nicer-looking and there is a far better selection than Underground 2, but that's the only plus this game has to it. You don't race as much as fly around the city in a barely-controlled frenzy, trying to stay ahead of the computer cars. Winning is more by luck than skill. He or she who hits the least obstacles wins. Hardly an enjoyable way to race! I get too stressed when playing this game, so I put it away for a while. Definitely rent before buying this game."
4,a more improved version of need for speed,"While the graphic and the details were very impressive and outstanding, the game starts with ease and then, later it gets rather frustrating. There is no force feed like Need For Speed- In Hot Pursuit so you have to frustratingly force the wheel in order to make the car respond. The scenes are so breathtaking and the characters are so lifelike that I thought, how in the hell did they do that? The songs are rather not in my favor so I tend to see that annoying. I would recommend that game for those who want to see what it is like to drive an actual car, though I feel that the game should be a bit tweaked up so I could find it easy to drive a real car instead of trying to force the car to respond when it seems to have a stubborn mind of its own."
2,Wrong Direction for the game,"OK i started out with a clear positive attitude for this game. I mean it's need for speed it has to be good, right. NO! I liked underground 2 with some of the best free roam capabilities for a racing game. Differing shops for differing needs. this one one stop shops and less customization than nfsu2. While your racing the cars paint scratches off! WTF? either you get damage or you don't. no lost paint! The cop chases suck! you either lose them way too easy or you are busted no matter how good you drive. bad game for me. you might like it, if you like underground games you won't."
2,Tons of Fun But Game Freezes From Time-To-Time (Sux),"When they said 'most wanted' they weren't kidding. Milestone or Bounty mode can have dozen of cops on your tail..shaking them off it's the most challenging and fun part of the game. I love the game over all but decided to write a review b/c I there is a major problem with the game which is from time to time it freezes w/o a reason. Especially when you are playing milestone or bounty race. It happened at least 4 times so far and usually after near completion of the milestone the game would freeze. Just a minute before the same thing happened again. Hence, I'm writing this review. If you faced the same problem plz post your review so I know I'm not the only one."
4,great game!,"This is a great game! I like to hit the cops into the walls. I like the cars, the colors and the music. Great game for a 10 year old. The only game I like better is Need for Speed Carbon."
5,#1 game for any system,"Best Game period. There are a few glitches here and there but this game is awesome. Buy this game and you will not regret it. Don't waste your money on Pro Street, Carbon, or the Undergrounds, Most Wanted it the way to go. It's hard but you always know what to do next, Great Storyline. 11/10 Stars. Please go to http://www.cmjreviews.blogspot.com/ for reviews for this game and other games too!"
3,Need for Speed: Most Wanted,"I have been enjoying playing this game. Once you get used to the speed brake and the nos button, your on your way to mastering this game.This defenitly beats Need for Speed2: Hot Persuit.1.I think the game could be better if they had us race at night through the city streets with the buildings aglow like New York or Las Vegas, in a couple of the races.2. I am getting my cars pretty fast as I try to win the game, my last wish for this game was, to bad the roads have to end before you can really see how fast your car can go, whether your racing or on free time. I always seem to have stop or brake sooner than I'd like to as the road curves as the race track keeps going along.I am having fun with the game anyways. The milestones requirements give the game a nice touch as it adds more fun to the game as you try to accomplish the task and avoid getting your car impounded. Good game !-M.O."
3,Not Bad.,"For me this game eventually got too bogged down with the 'milestones'. Getting the milestones and getting free of the cops became a pain in the butt. The cops seem to have inhuman maneuverability at times. You get into these chases that are just about impossible to get out of and you lose everything you achieved. The actual races were very good, though I didn't care for the drag racing."
2,It's no NFS Hot Pursuit 2!,"This game, while it has some strong points, also has some glaring weaknesses that drag it down. For one, this is THE WORST handling racing game I've ever played. The cars swerve left and right as if the tires are blown out, and it's all I can do to just flick the thumbstick back and forth constantly just to try to keep the cars in a straight line. Secondly, the graphics are subpar for a PS2 game. The colors look washed out and unrealistic. Final complaint would be the fact that there is no replay! What?? How lazy is this programming team! Hey, that was a great race you just won, too bad you can never see it again."
4,game glitches,well for one this game froze when I beat razor on the final race the first time and I noticed a few glitches also in the game like numbers will change during the game and other nonspecific things at first I thought it was my system but after reading responses it seems to be the game itself
3,underground 2 was better,"In Need for Speed Underground 2 upgrading your car was easy and fun. In this game it is more limited and a lot harder to do. Also the cop chases are lame, just like people have said they are either gone in a second or on your [...] like stink on crap. I liked the new races and they graphics were OK. It's a generally fun game especially with having a rank but i still think Underground 2 was better. Go for Carbon."
4,It's Alright,"This game isn't really bad at all. The only thing that I really didn't like about it is that you race in the daytime. I like that the cars are realistic-looking, and that you can use ""real-life"" cars like the Chevy Cobalt to race with. This was also an enjoyable characteristic of Need for Speed Underground II. Graphics are pretty good for using the PS2 platform. I thought the soundtrack could have been better, but overall it's alright. The thing that keeps me from fully enjoying this game is that I have Need for Speed Carbon as well, and I find that game much more fun and a lot more easy on the eyes."
4,Awesome addition to the NFS series,"I have always loved NFS. This game is no exeption. The Cop chases are really fun, the enviorment is huge and less restricted than in Underground 2 and the racing and car physics are just a little bit more arcadey. This is fine, as the physics in Underground 2 were really sim-like. The music was okay too. The only big problem was that at times the framrate was horrible, which can sometimes really hurt the games fun. the custimisation is back just as good as ever and is helped by a great selection of velichles."
2,where is the therapy here.,"I felt let down with this book,as I thought it was to be about helping souls,with psychotherapy,in the LDS community and how to go about it.Instead it has a lot to do with the church.This would be good for those looking to learn and read articles about religion and psychology."
3,Incomplete Description,"It doesn't say so in the item description, but even if your laptop accepts pc133 RAM, this module will not work with processors slower than 1Ghz. You have to get their pc100 RAM if you have such a processor. Be sure to check www.pny.com/configurator/ to make sure this module will work. I learned the hard way."
1,Doesn't work with Dell Inspiron 3800 as advertised,I could not get my Dell Inspiron 3800 to boot once in install the RAM.
1,Not compatible with Dell Inspiron 3800,"The amazon.com people actually called PNY for me and asked whether this unit was compatible with PC100 computers. They insisted it was. When I installed it, my computer went through a series of scary crashes. The Dell tech support person I talked to was sure that it was a compatibility problem. I have no issue with PNY, in general, but the low rating is because it was not compatible."
1,Wrong Product Discription,"This memory module is not PC - 100, but is PC - 133.Make sure that your notebook support PC - 133 memory module."
3,find another vendor!,"delayed 6 days before shipping. emailed and and took 6 more days to reply. reply stated ""they were very busy and even office staff is working on shipping"" no excuse for the delay of email reply. insufficiently prepared for success, so don't so don't burden with it!"
1,Didn't work even though it was suppose to!,"I purchased this memory for my laptop as my specifications met it. I even went to the manufacturer (PNY) website and used the configurator to check and see if this memory would work with my laptop. When I received the product, my computer wouldn't turn on when I installed the memory. So PNY did an exchange for me since I thought the memory may be defective. I received the new memory and the same result happened. The customer service was unable to explain it, they said it's the memory required for my laptop and should work...their only solution was to exchange it again, which I see no point. VERY disappointed and frustrated that for some freak reason this memory will not work with my system. I would say to double check before you buy, but I did all that and still ended up with memory that doesn't work. As most reviews say, it works great...just wished I could have had the same result!"
1,256 MB SO Dimm laptop memory,"I ordered the RAM memory for my Sony Viao relying on ANTonline's recommendation. Turns out the recommendation was wrong.Wrong speed version PC133, should have been PC100.I ordered the PC100 RAM directly from ANTonline, but the memory did not show present, and acted like its was defective memory.I'm very frustrated..........MJK"
3,Priceless humor in an awkward format,"First, let it be said that the humorous poetry contained within this volume is beyond price. Let there be no mistake about that. I gave this Kindle edition three out of five SOLELY due to the awkward formatting of this particular e-book edition.The book, which is over 700 pages long, has an index and a table of contents, and is broken down into six sections. However, no means is provided to easily get to the particular poem you want to read, nor even to the section in which it is located. I spent a half an hour marking the beginnings of the six sections with the Kindle bookmark feature, which is at least a slight help.Get this book, as it is definitely worth while for the poetry. You'll simply have to learn to live with the awkward formatting, as I have."
3,Watch out!,"I had great hopes for this watch as I wanted a funky cool change for spring-- the colors do not contrast as much as the photo depiction: I thought it would be really bright yellow swirled with green, but the colors were much more subdued.The description does say 'small ladies..', but I wish there had been dimensions and a picture of it on a model wrist-It's a very tiny watch, but the fit is fine. I just didn't care for it when I realized how small it was on my wrist."
3,Nike Presto,"This watch is ideal for a person with a very small wrist. Looks very nice but is light green not camo, looks more like yellow on my wrist. Good watch for a young girl."
1,Puerile and prurient!,"In my opinion the animadversions from other reviewers, regarding this book, are justified. This was easily the worst poetry book I've ever read.When one starts to read this book, one rapidly gets the feeling of general ennui. I found the poems to be very predictable uninspiring and wearisome. The content was puerile and prurient laced with a hint of anti-Semitism. I for one cannot fathom what Mathew Jones is going on about, none of the poems were about India. I can only assume he reviewed the wrong book.One should certainly avoid wasting their money on this book."
1,Rubbish,"I bought this poetry book from my local Borders, expecting a collection of stimulating and exciting poems. Much to my disappointment I found the most awful poetry imaginable intertwined with messages of hate and intolerance towards people of different faiths and races. The poetry lacked inspiration and did not read well i.e. it seemed to meander along in a monotone.I find it hard to fathom how such a poor collection of poems could be published. I can only assume that the poet is an amateur, who publishes his own work. The author would be well advised to embark upon a beginners poetry/writing course before producing any more books otherwise he will simply waste his own time and money.This book is certainly worth avoiding as it consists of very poor poetry with morally repugnant ideas."
1,Dreadful!,"I was very disappointed with `Transitions'; it was one of the worst poetry books I've ever had the misfortune to read.Kim's poetry is absolutely clueless; his use of English is so bad that many of the poems fail to make sense. There is no style or panache to the poetry, it simply rambles on in a series of monotonous phrases. The use of metaphors was so poor that the reader had difficulty imagining the situation the poet was trying to describe. After reading a few of these poems I became so bored that I decided to throw the book away.The content of these poems was at best puerile and at worst racist and offensive. It appears as though Kim has an obsession with Jews, Israel and Zionism since these topics are prevalent throughout his literature.This poetry was truly dreadful in every sense of the word, I advise prospective readers not to buy this book; otherwise they may end up wasting their money."
1,"Christian Dim's poetic treatise on Jews, Women and the Death Penalty!","'Transitions' is yet another of Christian Dim's gems. Kim describes how women flock to see him at every opportunity and listen with adoration whilst he preaches to them about Evangelical Christianity. Kim tackles the topic of the death penalty with relish, stating how he likes to 'push the button'. No Christian 'Dim' poetry book could ever be complete without a section on the Jews and he doesn't let us down. This book is a complete waste of time. The poetry is dire and the content is total drivel. Please avoid at all costs."
5,glad to have bought the book,"I bought this book after reading a review about it in a Welch poetry journal. And I am glad that I did. These poems caused me to reflect about my past and about ""how things could have been."" Yes, some of the poems are a bit sad from that point of view. But that's the power of H. C. Kim's poems, in my view. They elicit strong feelings. Sign of good poetry."
1,"Horrible, lewd and prurient!","These poems are typical of the offensive drivel that Christian 'Dim' publishes himself. The content of these poems is simply disgusting e.g. one poem describes a weird form of sexual intercourse where a man pushes a button on the computer keyboard to represent his willy, whilst the computer acts as the female. The man continues to press the button even though the computer is `saying' no a.k.a. rape. How much of this poem is based on fiction? One begins to wonder whether these poems display the disgusting sexual urges of the author. The above example is one of many lewd and prurient poems in this book. The poetry is awful and the content is disconcerting to say the very least, I would certainly advise all readers to steer well clear of this one."
5,Great Puzzle,"My 2 year old son just received this for his birthday. He thinks it's ok, but my 3 year old daughter absolutely LOVES it! As soon as she's done putting it together, she takes it apart and puts it together again.I hope that Santa brings her more Melissa and Doug floor puzzles for Christmas!"
5,Great puzzle!,"My son received this puzzle for his 3rd birthday and he loves it! He is a puzzle fanatic and has quite a stack of them. This is the one he selects the most. Like a previous reviewer said, he likes to put it together in sections, which is really neat to see.I like how thick the pieces are. So many other puzzles of his have bent pieces that no longer fit together properly. Hasn't been an issue with this one yet. And considering how often he puts it together, that is a great sign."
5,My 2 1/2 year old loves it!!,"This is a great puzzle! My son is 2 1/2 and wants to put it together almost every day! It is amazing to watch him, because every time we sit down on the kitchen floor to do this together he can do it more and more on his own! And when we are done he is so proud of himself, I love it! I am online right now looking for more just like it!"
3,Pieces de-laminate,"These are great puzzles, but the pieces tend to delaminate. It seems they're made of two pieces of pasteboard glued together. And they tend to peel apart, so that you have one half that has an image, and the back half that doesn't. Our home remains at a relatively low humidity because the AC is on a lot, but it's nothing really unusual. At first I thought our kids were peeling them apart, but the pieces are actually delaminating by themselves. So, if you buy this puzzle, your kid(s) will love it, but you'll need to also have a bottle of paper glue and some weights handy, because you'll be gluing the pieces back together all the time."
5,Great puzzle,My 3 year old grandson had no problem putting this puzzle together. He enjoys this puzzle. It is sturdy and the colors are very vibrant. I will be purchasing more Melissa and Doug puzzles for sure!
5,Nice but challenging kid's puzzle,"This is a fine child's size floor puzzle. The pieces are large, which is great for the 3 year old age range. My daughter loved it, and it seems to be well constructed as floor puzzles go.One word of note: this puzzle is a bit more difficult that it appears because of all the red barn puzzle pieces. So, a lot of those pieces really look the same for a 3 to 4 year old at first. So, kids will certainly need some help from adults when they first start trying this puzzle, as it is deceptively hard for that age range. I could see how some kids would become frustrated with it if you don't help them."
5,Great puzzle for 3 and 6 year old,We love this puzzle. Easy to put together but entertaining enough to put it back together over and over again. Sturdy and large pieces.
4,Family of six camping extraveganza,"I bought this rack with the extension to take our family of 6 and dog on camping vacations. It installed easily, was very solid and structured well. The load weight was not as heavy as I would have liked but the design and containment more than made up for it and no racks have any heavier load weight that I was able to find. Yakima products have never disappointed and have always been solid and dependable. I will continue to buy them."
3,Review for Nyokki Froggie Plant,"My son loved the Nyokki. It's very cute and he couldn't wait for the grass to grow, so he could give it a ""haircut"". However, I found it hard to take care of it, you have to put in just the right amount of water, so you don't over water it. And that's exactly what I did, and the plant was ruined."
3,"Good, but with a few problem.","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a good game but with a few problems- Lack of exploration, and interaction with other charecters. I mean, where are the other students and teachers? Why cant I explore hogwarts? Why is it level based? I mean exploring hogwarts, and interacting with other charecters are what made the other Harry Potter games great. But other then that its a good game.Gameplay: 8/10. Probably the best part of the game.Graphics: 10/10. Exellent graphics.Replay: 9/10 A ton a stuff to do after completing the game.Story: 6/10. Felt rused.Average: 8.1/10"
2,Prehistoric.....,"this game has the graphics of a video game from 10 years ago!! Very dissapointed...VERY! Game play was horrible, just an over all waste! DONT BUT THIS GAME!"
1,disgusted,"This product arrived sealed and EMPTY!!!, I reported it to you and have heard NOTHING, so I'm sure you inderstand when I say I am disgusted"
5,Find Peace in your hectic Life.........,"""Simplicity"" is simply Wonderful! The music takes you to that peaceful state of mind that we all need to travel to once in a while. When driving in my car I love to pop in this CD. The beautiful arrangements seem to calm those frantic worries of the day. I gave this CD to several of my friends, and they all love it also. Two of those friends swear that it is the only thing that calms their fussy infants while traveling in the car. In this crazy American lifestyle of hurry, hurry, hurry, it's a great alternative to the music being played on the radio. A+++++, I highly recommend ""Simplicity"" by Dianne Williams!"
1,Misleading Ad,This turned out to be nothing more than a 'beeper box'- no light bulb replacement for original back-up bulb - but it's loud!
5,A child's world through a crocodile's eyes,"Anyone who has ever had a birthday party as a child will be swept back to the excitement, the fears and the adventure of their first parties through the eyes of Lyle the Crocodile. Endearing and touching, any child (or adult) will lose themselves in this book. I write from memory-my mother read the Lyle books to me when I was four years old and they have stayed alive for me ever since. My sisters and myself are now buying them for our families."
2,prone to cracking,"I purchased this about six months ago. It is the perfect size and design for what I needed. I've cleaned it in the dishwasher, heated things in the microwave with it, treated it well and never dropped it, but it has developed a crack and now it leaks. I was hoping for something a little more durable. Seems like anything I purchase from Rubbermaid wears out within a year or two."
3,Not worth it,"I was looking for a higher quality measuring cup.I had decided against the new pyrex cups because of all the stories of the new material shattering or exploding.This one was described as a ""Commercial Product"", which I assumed meant that it was a higher grade than your standard store brand.It's about the same quality you will find anywhere for under $10.We will use it, but it certainly isn't worth what we paid."
4,Clear marking & microwave safe.,"Markings are easy to read. Great handle and pouring spout is best I've ever used. Does not have 1/3, 2/3, etc markings, but for my purpose to mix drinks, it's the best. Dishwasher safe. I wrote to manufacturer to determine if cup is microwave safe and IT IS!"
5,change my review,Reviewed this CD yesterday. Please correct my review--I said that Elton John was on the original bill that night. He was not--the Beach Boys closed the show.Sorry for the error.Lou Pintek
2,Not the Beach Boys best.,"Reportedly,this release of a 1980 concert was held up because the Beach Boys were not satified with the vocals on it and after hearing this concert I can see why. Definitely this is not one of their best efforts as the vocals are disjointed and the concert very disappointing.I would recommend the cds ""Beach Boys '69(Live In London)"" or ""The Beach Boys In Concert"" from 1973 as they are much better live performances by The Beach Boys.Forget about ""Live At Kwebworth 1980"" as it is not a very good effort."
2,Underpowered,"Amazon part finder said this would work in my 2002 Jeep Wrangler SE, however, it is underpowered and squeaks when I turn on my lights or a/c if I am idling."
5,A Must For Parents and Youth Workers,"Some believe it's almost impossible to bridge the gap between adults and teens. But In Real Issues Real Teens, Suzanne offers parents practical, and Christian-based principles for bringing the two generations together. Through her own transparency as a parent, her personal work with teens, and through true, ""live"" interviews, Suzanne lets the reader hear the hurts, joys, and frustrations from a teen perspective. From sexuality to spirituality, she offers frank advice and communication that allow any parent to climb inside their teen's thoughts. A fearful ride? Maybe. But not an impossible one. And somehow, this author makes the trip easier. I love Suzanne's compassionate, yet authoritative manner. Where was this book when my kids were teens? This is a book for parents, youth workers, grandparents, and anyone who works with or knows teens. Suzanne's love and passion for teenagers show on every page."
5,New Name Same Energy,"The new name, Pacifier, has done nothing to change the way these guys rock. The long awaited to Shihad's 1999 'The General Electric' is a rock solid album. Every track on this album has the potential to become a hit single. Im predeicting the single 'Bullitproof' which will be the 1st US single will shoot up the charts. As many listens as Ive given this album I cant find a negative thing to say about it. The bonus CD W.O.M.D. contains 5 killer tracks, of which Toxic Shock will be much anticipated live in concert. This album is a must have not only for old fans but a great way to intoduce new fans."
4,Soothing,"Soothing to listen to. I like it. Great for someone who likes flute music with a kind of an ""Eastern"" feel to it. There are some voice parts to it, and they blend in well. They add to the ""whole"".Good for listening in the background while on the computer, or for meditation. Talented man!"
1,"WARNING, this is a PC133 SODIMM","This is a PC133 SODIMM, there is an error on the Amazon info.It is NOT backwards compatible with PC100 notebooks. I tested it with several PC100 machines (HP Omnibook 4100, Compaq and Toshiba) and it does not work."
1,This is PC133 not PC100 memory,"Amazon sells this memory as PC100. It isn't. It is PC133. (Maybe what you meant is PC2100?) Unfortunately, it doesn't work in my Toshiba Satellite Pro 4300, which requires PC100 memory. The PNY site says that PC133 is OK in a PC100 slot. Another retailer specifically states that PNY PC133 memory is NOT backward compatible with PC100 or PC66 slots. Seems that they are correct.I can't tell you if these SODIMMs are good, bad, or indifferent. They are going back to Amazon on the first thing smoking."
2,"PC133 or PC100....Doesn't matter, Here's why",Ok Ok..I've had to deal with this before as I am in the industry. Most of the time the incompatablity is due to the use of High Density memory chips by the factory. These chips work fine with many systems but especially older ones may not work at all or only see half of the total RAM. You need LOW Density chips (which is compatible with almost all SDRAM systems (Except some that take ECC-RAM only)Fossil
1,NOT for IBOOK 700 regardless of PNY's own Memory config !,"PNY while stating that PC133 is not compatible with PC100 suggests thisproduct as the only option for MAC Ibook 700, 128MBWell, it is just wrong !Don't buy until you are sure your machine works with it"
3,Not that great,"Although it does seem to work and the 1st day my sons did use it.They have lost interest VERY fast.One day and now I haven`t seen them touch it. My sons are 6 and 8,and I thought they would get a kick out of it,but it wasn`t enough to keep their interest.But I guess it depends on HOW MUCH your son is into racing,if he loves speed, then this is the toy for your kid.I gave it 3 stars because this DOES work!!!But it couldn`t keep my kids interested."
3,A little harder than it looks,"This is a cool toy, but it is harder to use than it looks. You have to aim it just right to get a good reading, so little ones can get frustrated. My son is only 6, so maybe this toy would be perfect for a kid a bit older."
1,Nice try,I bought one for my sone for christmas and it doesnt work. Trust me do not buy this. We tried to return it and they said it works fine when i know i dont shoot a lacrosse ball 3 miles per hour dont buy this
2,Not as much fun as we thought,"We purchased this for our 5 year old son for Christmas. He LOVES anything ""Hot Wheels"", but this toy really does nothing for him. He never plays with it even though we have tried to come up with some creative ways to use it. I would have to say unless you get a good deal, save your money."
2,no fun,My son hated the minute he tried to use it...He's 8 and he ended up not playing with it and giving it away soon after getting it
2,NOT THE BEST INVESTMENT,We bought this radar gun for our 6yr old as his daddy is a race car driver and our son loves to see how fast things go. I think Christmas was the only day that my child played with it since its not exactly the neatest thing he has gotten. Our son lives for speed and has no fear. We took the toy out Christmas and was trying to radar people driving down the road and it will clock them but its pretty boring after awhile. Thats not the best investment. It looks fun and is fun for about one day then it goes to the bottom of the toy box. Hotwheels are ok with the gun but its hard to aim and get a good reading on one. I WOULD SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET SOMETHING WORTH THE MONEY.
4,Really works,This is a great product that really works. Obviously it is not as sensitive as the Police ones but great nonetheless. The scaling button for your Hot Wheels cars is a nice touch but it is very hard to aim at such a small object.Great good value toy and nice and solid too.
4,"Great toy, lots of fun!","A great toy that can actually be used as a learning tool when checking the speeds of different toy cars, people, birds, etc. All of the children love it--ages 3 to 10--and we parents had a good time checking it out also."
2,radar gun,"got it for use with RC stuff, works on cars, but not airplanes. well within 10ft range and it said my jet was doing 3 mph. oh well"
4,Fun Radar Gun,"Purchased this radar gun for our son to use with his science fair project. He needed to record the speeds of hot wheels trucks loaded with different weights. The gun was fairly accurate, and my son was able to prove his hypothesis. Now that the science fair is over, the gun can be played with, and our kids are having a lot of fun with it!"
3,Not good for policing,40 feet is a little close to get an accurate reading on a car. Could get run over by fast drivers. Good for play and sports activities.
5,FUN FUN FUN TILL THE DADDY TAKES THE RADAR GUN AWAY,"I GOT THIS FOR CHRISTMAS, AND I DON'T WANT TO STOP USING IT. ALTHOUGH IT'S REAL PURPOSE IS TO BE USED ON HOTWHEEL CAR'S IT IS HARD TO CLOCK IN THERE SPEED, BUT IT WORKS GREAT ON CARS IF YOUR WATCHING FOR SPEEDERS, PLAYING BASEBALL, OR EVEN RIDING YOUR BIKE OR SCOTTER. THIS IS A GREAT BUY AND I RECOMEND IT TO EVERYONE"
5,iInteresting reading,"Though the author is no professional writer, he certainly conveys the frustration and dedication he had during his investigation. I'm not surprised that some people with strong political and liberal leanings would take the time to try and bash him in a review of a book they probably didn't even read. I've met the man and he seemed to be an honest and decent person. I enjoyed reading the story from his perspective."
4,A lot of work but really neat product,What a mess to apply it went everywhere! But it works and is really neat my son is enjoying it. It is very textured so you definately need the good earth magnets!
3,Runaway Bridge by Jane Aiken Hodge (Fawcett Regency Novel),"Description from the book back cover:When tempestuous, red-haired heiress Jennifer Purchas was informed by her uncle she was to marry a stranger, she exploded. Years of pent-up resentment broke through in that moment, for her guardian uncle had made life miserable enough. And now this. To be forced to wed some odious fortune hunter. Never. Jenny fled, and took a position as companion to the formidable, old Duchess of Lewes. The Duchess suspected Jennifer was no ordinary young lady. And so did her grandson, handsome young Lord Mainwaring, who found Jenny's charms very disturbing. As for Jenny, how long could she keep her identity a secret? How long before her uncle's spies would discover her?Runaway Bride - a truly delightful romp through 19th-century England."
5,Awesome work by Edwin,"I was lucky enough to catch Edwin McCain live in Boston earlier this year. Before that I wasn't very familiar with his music aside from his radio ballads, so I was really surprised how much he absolutely. rocked. the. house. Besides being an amazing vocalist, the music ranged from earthy roots-rock to his signature love songs. He is a sensitive, often hilarious, storyteller with his words and guitar. When I heard his latest cd was an all-acoustic set, I purchased it almost immediately. Since then it's quickly become one of my all-time favorites!Highlights include ""Ghosts of Jackson Square,"" ""Go Be Young,"" a heartbreaking cover of ""Romeo and Juliet"" and the new hit ""I Want it All."" To top it off, there's a multimedia extra in the cd which includes some clips from Edwin's DVD (Mile Marker), and a stirring performance of ""I'll Be.""This is pure Edwin at his best. I can't say enough good things about this cd. Buy it, hear it, love it."
5,Never Disappointed!,"I anticipated the release date for this album for about a month. The day it came out I was at the record store to pick up my copy. When I got home to listen to it, I was not disappointed. All of the anticipation was not wasted. I have to say that this was one of the best albums that I've bought in quite some time (and I buy a lot of music). Usually when I buy an album I only hear three or four songs that I really like but I loved every song on this album and I've played it to death since I bought it almost a month ago! This album is full of excellence--musically, lyrically, and performance wise. It's well worth the adding to your collection today!"
5,You asked for it - You got it,") ""The Austin Sessions"" is a nice collection of old favorites and what are sure to become new ones. Die hard Edwin fas have been asking for this CD for years. Live show favorites like Eric Hamilton's ""Popcorn Box"", Mark Knopfler's(Dire Straits) ""Romeo and Juliet"", as well as Bruce Crichton's ""Island Song"" have been long awaited by fans to show up on a CD, and with good reason.....these songs are a nice fit for McCain's awesome voice. New songs such as the McCain Penned ""I Want It All"" and the Buddy Mondlock ""No Choice"" show that McCain can not only sing his own songs he can make any song his own. If you like no frills - true talent you will enjoy ""The Austin Sessions"" McCain fan or not."
4,Captures Edwin Live,"I love the Austin Sessions. Edwin gets better and better with each cd. The Austin Sessions is the closest thing to seeing Edwin live. Of course, nothing can be better than Edwin live in concert, but this cd comes close to giving you a taste of how great Edwin is live."
1,Disappionting!!!,A lot of re-hashed old songs that nobody cares about anymore.One of his worst to date! Co'mon Edwin...You can do better.Or has your time finally passed?
4,This game is very impressive!,"I love playing with this beacause you can make your own character and there are more and harder to beat enemies! Your character's name is Jaden Korr and the first mission is to save Rosh and make your way to the academy. I don't know why Lucasarts made Rosh let out a training droid in the second level. Your first Tier missions are Tatooine, Tatooine again, Bakura, Beenji and Corellia. I don't know the maps in the second Tier mission yet. My favorite mission in the Tier missions is the Corellia mission beacause your outside a cargo tram and you shouldn't fall! The mercs(mercenaries) and cultists almost look the same! I hope you all love this game!"
3,Decent,The best thing about the game is the multi-player option where you get to run around and lightsaber people in a free for all like counter strike.
4,Multiplayer was the best,"Yeah. It was. Sorta ruined it for me on the already long, boring, and tedious single player mission game. Why work up to all the levels when you can go on multiplayer mode and battle it out with multiple enemies with dual sabers and awesome moves? I have yet to learn.It's a pretty good game. Even if you're not into Star Wars (I haven't even seen the movies yet :))you'll like it. But remember - it's all about the multiplayer. :)"
4,Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy,Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is a good game and the company is a good company and if you want to have a good deal you will get it from these people for your pc games!!
3,more action less mazes,I loved the game until I was locked up in a prison cell on a planet and In couldn't find my way to fight the big guy there. I tried it 6 times and got very pissed off.
4,Great Game!,"Jedi Academy is a fun, creative, and ultimately great game. The gameplays good, graphics great, and storylines o.k. I have few complaints for this game, because this game is a true heir to Jedi Outcast, and more! It gives players the chance to change the looks of their character (species, clothes, sabers, ect.), which is great, because now you girls don't have to play as guys!Pros:-Great levels-Good gameplay (if you like lightsabers)-Star Wars feelCons:-Only able to get double-bladed. dual lightsabers near the end.-Can only turn to the dark side near end."
4,Play it for the speeder mission...,"This latest Jedi offering has more good points than bad:The Good:- The ability to customize your character.- More Force power options.- More light saber moves/styles.- Double-Bladed light saber or double-single sabre option.- *Mission where you get to ride and fight in a speeder, kind of like a futuristic demolition derby, great fun!- Riding Tauntauns.- Very few stupid puzzles.- Tons of light saber fighting opportunites!- Raven Software (Soldier of Fortune 1 and 2) co-built the game.- Force Grip power more fun than ever! (Build up your Grip power then use it to grab stormtroopers and drop them from cliffs, use them as shields, etc..)The bad:- A few boring, stupid missions, like picking up ship parts in the desert.- Force Sense power = only good for stupid puzzle-centric missions.This game is worth the money."
5,Jedi Acadamy: Much Better than expected,"Jedi Acadamy is third game of the Star Wars: Jedi Knight series. It uses the same old Jedi Outcast Engine but it's developed and way better than JK2. The Game is costomisable and it's the coolest part. You can design your player and the Lightsabertoo. The story line is great and there are many extra stuff like more force powers, duel lightsabers and double-bladed lightsabers. It's way cooler and Lucasarts has done a neat job on it. It even has Kyle Katarn, the hero of JK2. It ports good graphics, sound and rich game play. Let's hope Knights of the old-republic is even better."
5,"Great Game, great story",i borrowed jedi academy from my friend and i beat it about 11 times and it was so much fun each time. I like how you can make your own lightsaber and character. The story is really good to. It will make you think you are a jedi!
2,Jedi Outcast Revisited,"Don't get me wrong, If I had never played Jedi Outcast (to which jedi academy is its succesor) I would think Jedi Academy is a wicked cool game! BUT, it seems LucasArts has simply re-released Outcast with a SLIGHTLY different look, the same graphics engin, the same weapons, virtually the same force powers, the same characters...and only with a slightly different setting and different locations. Ok, yeah, you can choose which color your light-saber you use and what you look like etc.... wow - I've never had that in a game before (note the sarcasm). In my opinion, games in a series are meant to evolve and change over time - like Warcraft for example...the graphics and characters and story changed dramatically between the 3 games. An even better example would be the Ultima series -each game was different than the one before it (with some similarities inherant in being a part of the same game series.)In the end, Jedi Academy = Jedi Outcast - take your pick."
5,Wicked Game,"This Game is awesome man. My friend has this game and its wicked. It's a little confusing and hard when you start, but you get the hang of it. You can change what you look like and what your lightsaber looks like. It is funny when you rescue prisoners because you get to a safe place away from the rancor, and then all of a sudden a prisoner turns a corner and the rancor comes chasing after him. There are cheats you can type in. I`ll give you one cheat. You press and hold down the left shift, the plus sign, and then the ~ buttons. Then type in helpusobi 1. Then type in ""undying."" What I really like about this game is the swinging, throwing, and shooting action. My drain is level 6 right now and grip is level 4.Single Player- GreatMultiplayer- GoodSelecting Character- Good choicesOverall a great game."
1,DONT BY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,BY STAR WARS THE KNITES OF THE OLD REPUBLICITS MUCH BETTER
4,Sweet Game!!!,"You should totally buy this game. It will keep you going with hours and hours of fun. From capture the flag, and free for all battles and other game types,slice your way thorough with a lightsaber and many other available weapons. You can even design your own lightsaber, have one in each hand or a double sided one. Overall, this game is great. The only thing I didn't like was the Graphics, but other than that, The combat is great fun, you can play online with your friends, and capture the flag is a really fun thing to play on thisgame. When I first played this game at a friends house, he told me it was only ten dollars, and I couldn't believe it!"
5,Just Plain Fun,"This game, like its predecessor Jedi Outcast, allows you to immerse yourself in the world of being a Jedi Knight and using a lightsaber and force powers to rip through the bad guys (or guys guys :-) ), and from the very beginning of the game. It's not hard to play (though getting down all the keys for the various powers you acquire might take some effort) but is VERY entertaining. My only let downs were 1. There wasn't as much character customization as I'd hoped, 2. The game is really more of a BIG expansion pack to Jedi Outcast, and 3. You can't skip some of the cut scenes. That said, it has amazing multiplayer and its single-player is just plain fun."
2,too short and too easy,"Whereas the original dark forces and subsequent games focused on puzzles within the missions, jedi academy was more concerned with fighting with light sabres. There was almost no use for conventional weapons, the lightsabre wielding adversaries were easily defeated just by pushing as many buttons on the keyboard as you could and as fast as you could. In dark forces II it took a long time to develop as a character with enough time to have fun with the force. In Jedi outcast you didn't have enough time to have fun using advanced sabre techniques, and in jedi academy it was overkill. I just would like to have seen a game that had more difficult mazes and puzzles in the levels . . . or maybe I'm just getting smarter . . . It literally takes about 6 hours of solid playing time to get through this one . . . oh wait, I can play it again and try to find all the secret areas. Wait till you can buy it used."
4,Alot of fun!,"I have never played any of the games that came before Jedi Academy in the series. So, I cannot compare it to those. Anyways, I certainly do not regret this purchase. This game sucked up a great deal of my free time and I was happy to give that time up. My only criticism is that I didn't feel you really had many choices in the customization of ones character."
4,A good MULTIPLAYER game...,"Yeah yeah yeah, it runs on the Quake engine, who cares? It is pretty fun single player game, though you'll get tired of it quickly after playing it once. However, the multiplayer option is really fun. Lightsaber and forcepower action galore, this game is a must have for anyone who needs to yield the force. I found this much better than Star Wars Knights of the Old Replublic, where you don't actually control your powers, you get a , ""what would you like to do... 1.)hit 2.)punch 3.)use force"" prompt. I'm sure the new Episode III game is similar."
2,DONT BUY WARNING,"Do not buy this game. It sucks. there is no plot, and it is twice as short as the last two. All you do is go on stupid missions to become a jedi. Then you go to some temple and Tavion is there bringing back a dead dude and you kill her. Very boring. Nothing like the last two. If you still like Dark Forces do not buy this game."
4,"firebrand, your pc is a load of rubbish","hey, last time i checked ""P4 3.0 Ghz, 512 MB of RAM, and an ATI Radeon X300 SE with 128MB of Video Ram"" is NOT a ""powerhouse pc"". it wasnt even a powerhouse pc 1 year ago. most pc's have been running a gig of ram for over a year. and last time they checked, they had to overclock a 3.6/3,8 ghz p4 processor to like 5ghz to match an fx55, so your processor is crap. 3.4ghz has been the standard for over a year now in most new pc's.most gamers also use 256mb cards.also your graphics card is also the cheapest, lowest range card ati do since yours is x300 and they go right up to x850,lol.plus its a dell, which shows how ignorant you are about ""power computers"".so yeah, dont moan and say u got a powerhouse pc, because all u got was a really rubbish spec'd pc, no doubt for a very cheap price from dell."
3,Jedi Academy,Amazon was a reliable site from which to obtain this product. It is about what I expected.
5,I WANT IT!,I WANT THIS GAME SO BAD! I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT IT! I MUST GET THIS GAME! I MUST HAVE THE FORCE! MUST HAVE! HELP! MUST GET GAME! AAAHHHHHHHH!
4,Check out the NEW album!,"This is a rather variable collection of demos and radio sessions -- BUT, the new CD, 'Belladonna', is now available ... (with sound clips) and it's superb!! Not to be missed, recorded at Peter Gabriel's Real World studios."
3,They'll get the job done but beware,"The battery terminals appear to be well constructed,have decent weight to them and come in a ten pack.A word of caution however, the back of the card contains the following warning:CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION 65 WARNING: This product contains chemicals, including lead, known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling.Furthermore if terminals are handled with bare hands it is quite possible to get a tiny metal burr in the finger. As such I would suggest wearing gloves when handling if possible."
5,Project Greenlight 2,I must say that the second season of Project Greenlight was some of the most engrossing viewing I've enjoyed in years.I'm not a person who watches much television at all so for me to actually purchase the dvd set is saying much.As an aspiring filmmaker I felt this dvd set was the next best thing to an actual internship.A really educational and inspiring television series.I wasn't crazy about the film and thought it was actually mediocre.I don't blame the directors for this and if you watch the episodes detailing the day to day process you'll understand why.I can't recommend this product highly enough.A must for aspiring filmmakers.
5,Return to childhood,"Those of us who grew up in the New York area during the 60's remember these episodes so well we can recite the cheesey themesongs. In New York the shows were broadcast on WOR channel 9. Captain America on Monday, The Hulk on Tuesday, Ironman on Wednesday, Thor on Thursday and the Submariner on Friday. The joy for me was recognizing the stories from my comic book collection and enjoying the artwork. The animation was ridiculous but who cares. I was traveling in India 10 years ago and was surprised to see episodes broadcast at 6 am in Delhi. You can also catch portions of episodes on YouTube."
3,"MISSING ""THE HULK"" ON MY SET!!!!!!!!!!!!","I have just recently purchased this set on region 2 new and it was perfect except no Hulk!! I was so hurt and could not understand why they would not include one of the more important titles from this series! It looks like Jetix and Disney produced this set and we almost got the cigar on it but no Hulk is not cool. I would have wanted Captain America to fall instead. But I got My fav of the series The Submariner, also Iron Man, Thor & Cap with all 13 episodes of each. The audio is ok and the picture looks the same as when I watched them in the late 70's so I've been really taking a trip back. Have to get that Hulk Though. I haven't seen this set on DVD in 4yrs. I have physically held the VHS version in my hand with all 5 of the series but passed on the format to wait for the discs which I've only seen once with all 5. Lets try it again Marvel this time without the red tape! later Y'all!!!!!"
1,Don't bother!,Save yourself some time and energy and seek your information elsewhere. This book is as empty as Buddhism itself. Find your spiritual awakening in life--not in this trash.
5,Quiet Heriosm,"""Infantry Soldier"" is the Diary of all Infantrymen. The Horror and Reality of War on the front lines by one who experienced and witnessed young men die in foxholes, in the winter of 1944-45 on the westernfront during the battle of the Bulge.Mr Neill tells the story of the real ""Heroes"" as they fought the bitter cold and held the line.As a soldier on the front lines and now a seasoned journalist, he brings you into the foxholes of young infantrymen who fought,died ,and survived a horrible front line experience. As a former Infantryman with the 38th division [Philipines]I found ""The Infantry Soldier"" as real as you can get. It explodes with the realiasm and bluntness of front line combat.George did a magnificant job of describing the Infantrys roll in WW2.He told the story as it should have been told. I Salute you Mr. George Neill. Fred Silberstein"
5,easy read,"This book was really easy to read.My father was in the Battle of the Bulge;he was in the 99th division,395 Reg,Hdg.company.He never told me very much about what he did or what it was like when he was there.Reading the book gave me a good idea of what my Father went experienced."
5,Tears of gratefulness for sharing the harrowing details,"Words cannot describe how Saving Private Ryan pales when compared to the experience I had reading INFANTRY SOLDIER. I could not put the book down and when I did, when I finished reading it in two nights, I could only conclude that this wonderful country that we live in is the result of all the brave and heroic men that George W. Neil describes in his book. Mr. Neil mentions a WWI commentator who declared that if common soldiers suddenly became articulate and could write and describe their experiences, the war would not last a month. I only hope leaders all over the world will be required to remember this by reading INFANTRY SOLDIER before committing to warfare. I was born, February 5, l944, when George began fighting for me and I am eternally indebted for I would not be here, I'm certain, were it not for him. George, as the song goes, there will never ever be another you. My deepest gratitude for writing the book."
4,Infantry Soldier:Holding the Line at the Battle of the Bulge,This book on the Battle of the Bulge is one of the better ones. It keeps with the historical aspects of what really happened that month in December and January. In some parts of the book you can just read and imagine that you are there with Luftwaffe and U.S. Army Air Force aircraft running all over the sky and Panther tanks firing rapidly at the woods and small villages with machine guns and heavy explosive rounds. Act as if your a soldier in a fox hole not knowing if a German Attack or Counterattack could open up in the cold wintery nights of December. Or your in Bastogne surroned by crack Wehrmacht divisions ready to blow you out of the city with a move of your hand. Will you wait for daylight for Allied bombers to drop you supplies and Bomb and Strafe German Attacking tanks in the city. Will you hold the line on the Bulge in Hitler's last offensive in the Ardennes?
4,HOURS OF FUN FOR YOUR CLIFFORD FAN!,"MY DAUGHTER IS A HUGE CLIFFORD AND EMILY ELIZABETH FAN. SHE LOVES THIS SET! SHE PRETENDS SHE'S READING CLIFFORD A ""SPECKLE"" STORY. IT IS SO CUTE! IF YOUR CHILD IS A CLIFFORD FAN, YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. THIS ITEM IS VERY PORTABLE, COMPACT WITH MINIMAL PIECES THAT STORE AWAY INSIDE CLIFFORD'S ""HOUSE"". ALL PIECES ARE VERY DURABLE. ENCOURAGES PRETEND PLAY AND IMAGINATION. WOULD MAKE A GREAT GIFT FOR THAT SPECIAL BOY OR GIRL IN YOUR LIFE!"
4,"Great toy, but watch out for the little ones!","We recently purchased this toy for my 5 yr old. Clifford's house ""case"" is a little hard to open. The case and toys are otherwise well made and definately worth the money. Emily Elizabeth and a couple other pieces are major choke hazards, so keep this away from babies. This toy is a lot of fun and my son loves it."
4,Indicators,"Good product - easy to use nd not a problem to cast - they float great and are very sensitive - if you miss a take it is on you! very visible in all lighting - just wish they sent more ""toothpicks"" as I re-use my indicators over and over"
1,Stopped working after 2 months,"This mixer was highly reviewed at the time we bought it, but ours started conking out randomly after only 2 months -- it would work one day and then not work the next. Whether it will work any particular time is uncertain enough that we are buying a new one today. No matter what the features an appliance has, that rates an automatic 1-star in my book!"
2,bad buttons!,"After my first Cuisinart hand mixer died from 10 years of heavy use, I decided to be brand loyal. Now, I am questionning my decision. The buttons for increasing/decreasing speed seem to be backwards (not intuitive!) -- I would prefer they were reversed. Beyond that, the button to eject the beaters cracked and the pieces fell inside the mixer after just a few uses. Additionally, the power seems weak - especially for cookie dough. I am very disappointed!"
4,cuisinart 7-speed hand mixer,"While I've only used it once so far, it has lived up to Cuisinart high quality reputation and a very good product value for the price point. The quality and functioning also appear to be consistent with the positive reviews I researched/reviewed. Most importantly, for a hand mixer it appears to have sufficient power for tougher mixing jobs. And, the slow-start and variable speed feature is wonderful, and now one I wouldn't be without. The only thing this particular Cuisinart model doesn't have that its close competitor, Kitchen Aid DOES have, are the dough beater and blender attachments. Oh well, as with just about any decision in life, it's all about tradeoffs!"
4,Fascinating insight into the mysterious world of show biz,"Even without the central theme of coping with OCD, this book offers unique insight into the travails of making it in the ""industry"" and the never-ending pursuit of success. To have access to the mind of someone who has survived and conquered this elusive brass ring is a rare treat. That the author was able to navigate the minefield up the ladder with the added baggage of Obsessive Compulsive Disoder make the story even more compelling.This book serves as a vital primer on the vagaries of achieving success while simultaneously shining a spotlight on the illness that is OCD. It's an entertaining and illuminating discourse."
4,Very educational,"This book though it was a little bland it was very educational. I liked it because I too have OCD and it was nice to read about someone who has made so much with their life go through some of the same stuff. Although his OCD is on a much greater scale then my own it was something I could relate to. I would recomend this book to not only those with OCD, but those who don't have it. It really gives you a better understanding what OCD really is."
5,enjoyed your book Marc,I thoroughly enjoyed your book. It is something any shrink would be wise in having their patients read even if they have a disorder other than OCD.
5,More than what you see on TV,"I've enjoyed seeing Marc Summers on TV since he hosted Double Dare. I don't have OCD, nor do I know anyone personally who has it, but I enjoyed reading about Marc's experience with the disease. It is an inspiration to all about how you can overcome things that can be overwhelming and also helps you to appreciate your own ""normalness."" Thanks Marc for sharing your life with us! Keep up the good work! We'll keep watching you on Intuition and Unwrapped!"
4,Good read!,I thought this book was very good and informative. One thing I did not understand was why Mr. Summers felt the need to keep letting the reader know how much money he was making at any given time. Is that an O.C.D symptom? It also jumped around a little too often. I have a friend that I think may have this. I plan on purchasing her a book for Christmas to see if she finds the similarities.
5,"An intimate, revealing, honest memoir on OCD","As someone who suffers from OCD with neatness and cleanliness compulsions, this book was very helpful. Mark's story made me feel less alone...and most important, that there is hope of getting better. Mark's story presents OCD as it affects individuals who have it, with the added ""bonus"" of factual information. A recommended read for anyone who has OCD, for family members of OCD sufferers, or anyone interested in experiencing a firsthand account of OCD."
3,Does not work with T42 or newer batteries,"When I bought, the description clearly stated: ""Compatible with all ThinkPad X, T, R and A Series batteries."" It's not. As the listing now states, ThinkPad T42 and newer ThinkPads can't use this charger.The vendor did promptly issue a refund and they have added a bullet point to correct the ad."
3,A FEW GREAT TRACKS,"I AGREE WEEZER MUSIC DOES NOT TOTALLY TRANSLATE TO STRINGS AND ALL THE SONGS ARE NOT GOOD, BUT THERE ARE A FEW THAT I THINK ARE INCREDIBLE RENDITIONS, SPECIFICALLY(BUDDY HOLLY, DOPE NOSE, EL SCORCHO, UNDONE) NOT EVERY TRACK IS A WINNER BUT IF U LIKE WEEZER ITS A MUST HEAR"
1,Ugh ... who would actually buy this?,"I want to start by saying that I love Weezer. But this is awfull! Weezer does not have music that translates into strings. Weezer has straight forward, tonal, I IV V style ... not the type of complexity that lends itself to a four piece string ensemble.Sorry, but I would stick to regular good ol' Weezer."
4,I love string tributes!,"I really like this CD and have added it to my ""Tributes"" collection. I'm not a ""die hard"" Weezer fan, but I do like the original songs. It's different, yes, and you might not like it, but that's the same with everything. I also like it when other musicians remake the songs in tributes. String, Bluegrass, and even Burlesque tributes are an amazing and, I'm sure, flattering salute to the original artists."
1,Funny - but not in a good way.,"There is no way I would ever buy this from listening to the clips provided. It's awful. Being both a big Weezer fan and a classically trained musician, I can tell you, this is the sort of garbage that is ruining classical music. Not much popular music translates well to a string quartet/""classical"" arrangement, as is evidenced here. Even Paul Anka's new album is better than this, which isn't saying much. For decent ""classical"" arrangements of popular music, try Christopher O'Riley's ""True Love Waits,"" which is Radiohead on piano, or ""Apocalyptica,"" which is Metallica played by 4 excellent cellists, but even those pale in comparison to the originals."
1,Um....yea.....,"The word that comes to mind is NOVELTY. Even if you are a Weezer fan, this would not be on your ""to get"" list. This is in simple terms, a joke. I know it's been said before but I think it bears repeating; this does not translate well at all. Now if you are looking for something that does translate well in the ""String Tribute to"" category, check out the Radiohead version called ""Strung Out On OK Computer"". As for me, listening to the samples of this cd is enough."
4,this is just eerie,A definite must have for a Weezer fan. Buddy Holly and El Scorcho are the best tracks.
4,Very nice,I like this album because most people wouldn't even think of doing this. I like the way they chose to make it sound a little classical. It is worth every penny.
5,Just watching this makes the day better,"I can't begin to tell you how much this movie makes the day better. Oh, all right. Let me explain that. It's the kind of movie that you'd think by the tenth-thousandth time you'd be sick of. After all there's nothing like seeing it for ten thousand times... but why not make it ten thousand and ONE times? ""The Parent Trap"", with Hayley Mills in a dual role, both award-winning, Maureen O'Hara as the busy yet lovable mum, and the great suave devonair dad played by Brian Keith... a movie to triumph. See it or else you'll wish you had the chance."
2,Okay,"This movie is okay. The storyline is cute, but I would reccommend the more recent version over this. In this the twins are older then in the other one. Their tricks on the soon to be bride of there father are not nerly as good as the ones played in the newer version. Lindsey Lohan played more believable twins then Hallie Mills did. I liked the way the parents acted towards eachother in the new one. They were calm and polite. In this one though they were slapping, cussing and throwing fits whenever they were in the same room together. It was also very long and some parts were rather boring, while in the new version everthing is interesting. One thing I will say for the old version is that I like how the song ""Lets Get Together"" is in the movie unlike the new one. But I would say if you could see the new one then just stay away from this version."
1,See the new one!!!,"This is a good movie, until you see the newer version... then its bad.Its so boring! If you want to see this movie...see the new one with Lindsay Lohan!!!!!!"
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"This movie was so bad, that I regretted renting it and also I had to turn it off and watch another movie after about 5 minutes. Freaky Friday rocks!!! The Parent Trap... ZZzzzzzzzzzzz."
5,"Entertaining Movie, A Bit Dated, But One Thing:...","The movie's very entertaining on its merits, despite being a tad dated in the new millenium. However, in the perspective of the 60's, quite well done. The one thing that has ALWAYS bothered me about this movie and critical responses to it is the underlying fact that what these 'parents' did to their children, splitting them up, never letting either know about the twin or even seeing the other child for 12 years, is just HORRIBLE and, worse, is virtually a non-issue with the family. Yes, it is mentioned, but never truly explained nor could it be: such an action is never justified or defensible. This is also true of the recent remake, and perhaps Hollywood should concentrate a bit more on common sense, morality and true family values rather than 'entertainment.'"
2,Good but not as new one,"Though story is evergreen, the old movie lacks the emotions. See new one that is 10 times better than the old"
3,you get what you pay for,new undamaged yea its great but i got mine in the mail damaged from the vender but other wise its a nice fan
3,culligan p5-d filtration cartridges,"Filters arrived on time and in good condition. Filters fit in my three stage rainsoft under sink filter, but are loose in the chamber leading me to beleave that water may bypass the filter. The specs stated the length & diameter as the same as I was replacing. May need to swell within the chamber. Overall, it gets a 3."
4,Good filter for its' price,I've been using this product since I installed my water filter 2 years back and I am very satisfied with it. My water can't taste any better. Rather get a water from my filter than buying a bottled water.
5,Keeps the rust and sand out of our water.,"We have city water. We have lots of iron and occassional sand in the lines, especially when the city doesn't flush lines often enough. This filter keeps the toilet mechanisms working and the rust stains on fixtures down. It is also a help in keeping my laundry free of rust stains."
3,Feedback,Description of item was unclear so expected qty 1 of a two pack and were surprised to receive only 1 cartridge
4,Good Filter,"The filter is good, no issues there. However, look for bulk packaging if you need to change filter regularly to see savings."
2,A Masterpiece? - NOT,"I should have known. Only one review for this DVD and they called it a 'masterpiece'. What was I thinking?? This was boring. The film is terrible to look at, cheaply made, terrible actors, and not scary. I want my money back! Never trust a film that has only one review with five stars. Wait until you read more reviews from sane people about what they think of it. I would have given it one star, but it was well researched, so I'm giving it two stars. But skip it anyway. Believe me, I was born in Wisconsin, there ain't nothing going on up there worth making a DVD about. Except for Ed Gein, but even that was 40 years ago. This film did put me to sleep, so I'm grateful for that. Guaranteed to give you a good night's rest. Maybe I should have given it three stars for that?"
1,Pice of garbage,Worst pice of garbage I have ever seen badly done do not waste your money cheesy re-enactments bad narroration every thing was based on urban legend no real facts to back up any story so folks do not waste a cent on this Terd
1,Broke in less than two years of light use-you pay for warranty,"The handle snapped after less than two years of light use (we aren't even at the house where this one was one third of the year). Ten year warranty, but you have to pay shipping both ways."
5,Cannot do any better for the price,The price quality for this wine opening kit is very hard to beat..makes a nice gift for those people doing it the old-fashioned way...
4,You Get What You Pay For,"One reason we took so long to buy the original Rabbit was the price. At local retail outlets the list price was near $100.00. We tried the knock off brands and they are a complete waste of money. Amazon listed the Rabbit (with Kit) at prox $60.00 so we jumped on it. We now realize that we should have bit the bullet and gotten the Rabbit to start with. Truth is in the old adage ""You get what you pay for."""
5,A Vital Piece of Equipment,"Whether you're having wine for a small dinner or for a large party, the Rabbit is what you want. I saw one being used by a friend, and bought one on his recommendation. I'm glad I did.Other reviewers comment on the ease of use, and they're right: the very first time using it only took 5 seconds to figure out and open the bottle. The simplicity makes you wonder why it took hundreds of years to create -- and compliments from others seeing the device is a nice bonus!The kit comes with other nice tools -- the foil cutter, too, is a necessity. I'm just surprised I don't yet see this everywhere wine is served!"
2,Rabbit gets sticky after four years,The device works well mechanically. You should know that there is a coating on it that gives it a nice matte black finish & rubbery texture that feels good to hold for about 3 years. Then at about four to five years of age it turns sticky and will leave a black gunk on your hands; not good.I think a $40 corkscrew should last longer than four years. Buy a Screwpull or an all-metal corkscrew.
1,design flaw,The corkscrew goes in the cork very smoothly and then pulls out without withdrawing the cork. The mechanism should have an interlock to prvent the screw from turning when withdrawing the cork. This devise is poorly designed - stick to your your old hand corkscrew!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,a solid read,"This book by Leitch is an impossible task. How do you cover the doctrines of Barth, Brunner, Bonhoeffer, Bultmann, Neibuhr and Tillich in one book, much less in 62 pages. The author admits that it is impossible to cover all parts of their theology, buty he covers the neo-orthodox aspect and separates it from the orthodox position and in this he does an admirable job. It is a quick and fairly easy read in a complex field of thought. An excellent job!J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,Some Very Good Stuff Here!,"The Splinter Group features Peter Green(baum), Nigel Watson, Roger Cotton, Peter Stroud and Larry Tolfree. ""Reaching The Cold 100"" features 13 new original tunes and four ""bonus tracks"" in which the Splinter Group remakes Greens trade mark tunes, ""Black Magic Woman"", ""It Takes Time"", ""Green Manalishi"" and ""Albatross"". Musically, the guitar work of Watson and Green is in top form and all of the songs, including the reinterpretations, sound crisp. I was not sure whether I would enjoy hearing a modern day interpretation of these tunes but I did, especially ""Black Magic Woman"". On the downside, the vocals of both Green and Watson are noticeably weak and despite the fine playing, the vocals tug hard in the direction of 3 stars rather than 5. If you can get past the vocals, you will find some rather pleasing and surprisingly good material here. ""Look Out For Yourself"" and ""Cool Down"" are two of the brighter spots."
4,"Works well, and a great price","We just got this item this past weekend. It was $9.99 at Best Buy - one of the best prices we'd seen on an iPod holder for the car, and it seemed like it would be easy to transfer back and forth between cars. It was extremely easy to put together, and to mount to the vent in my car. My only gripe is that if you put the foam pads in, it's way too tight of a fit (we have a 30GB video iPod). So, in order to keep it from scratching the back of the iPod when putting it in and taking it out, I went to our local hardware store and got some of those felt pads you put on the bottoms of furniture. I stuck them to the main surface of the holder, and it works great - perfect fit, and doesn't scratch. Definitely a good buy overall."
5,just what I was looking for,this book was exactly what me and my son were looking for and it showed up in a very timely mannerthanksJoseph Ricci
4,Remington Shaver works well,I bought this shaver and have been pleased with it's performance in every way. It's easy to use and easy to clean. When new it got all hairs in a single swipe. I like it's looks too.
3,I HAD BETTER SHAVER'S!,THIS IS A OK SHAVER BUT NOT THE BEST IT REALLY DOESN'T CUT GOOD AND IT IS HARD TO MOVE AROUND. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
2,Not as good as the title track.,The CD is not as good as the first single makes it out to be. There is alot of music without a beat to it. It sounds like shes trying to give us a taste of what she really sounds like without all the technological improvements. Her lyrics also lack that a rhyme which most humans like. All of her songs start to mesh into one big sob story.
1,Very disappointing :(,"What happened here? I thought this album was going to be off of the hook. This Cd did not meet even my minimal expectations which is usually three good songs. Unforunately, it didn't make it that far. This album has no particular flow. The best song here is Addictive.I was hoping for so much more and yet I was disappointed again by another hyped up artist. I will give this album one star for Addictive."
5,its the truth and it hurts!,"i love truth hurts she is one of the artists out there that is actually keeping it real! her lyrics,her style, her persona! all that is real with the cd. i feel that this is a wonderful cd! dont expect no ordinary r&b with this cd. it does have profanity from her and her musical guests and cita which i feel that the song with cd was something original with the controversy surrounding the BET diva. even if some people felt it wasnt necessary well its the truth and it hurts! if you want music that is orignal and defintley going to the left then you need to cop this! my favorite songs are addictive, this feeling,real,b.s,the song with r.kelly the whole cd is good!"
4,From West To East,"With King Tutankhamen lips, she is truly an Egyptian, Nubian Queen; unfortunately her proper royal direction was not known until the un-controlling spirit struck during the final track recorded, ""Addictive"". It is truly a masterpiece and a new direction for her, Dre, and Quik.The CD is a good work, even though some European barbaric words are a direct antithesis to the Ethics of an Ethiopian Queen. However, I expect more from the next CD, now that she and Dre know that the true and proper direction is from the West to the East."
2,Truthfully Disappointed,"I loved the Addictive song and bought the Cd expecting that same quality, but I was disappointed. Truth Hurts has a wonderful voice, but the songs on this track are over sung. The songs ""talk too much trash"" for a newcomer. Because she worked with artists who have written, sung, and produced excellent tracks for others or themselves, it made me even more disappointed because I expected a lot more..."
1,Disappointing and Weak,"It's too bad that there is only one good song on the whole cd (""Addictive""), and we have heard it for the past month or so. The rest of the cd is very weak, and wish that I could get my money back. Maybe her next cd will be better, if there is one. The truth really does hurt."
3,Harry Anand helps the rap world learn about Lata Mangeshkar,"Lata Mangeshkar also called the Nightingale of India, has been the doyen of the Indian playback scene for the last five decades and is still going strong. Born on September 28, 1929 in Indore, Mangeshkar has been active in all walks of Indian popular and light classical music having sung ghazals, bhajans and pop. In fact, she has sung over 50,000 songs in 20 Indian languages for three generations of heroines, ranging from Madhubala to Zeenat Aman to Kajol. She even made it to the Guinness Book of Records as the most recorded artist in the world.The hindi lines: 'Kaliyon ka chaman jab banta hai, thoda resham lagta hai, thoda sheesha lagta hai'. is the sample from the Movie 'Jyoti' produced in 1981."
4,Truth Hurts - Truthfully speaking,"Dr. Dre has been a great entrepreneur for her. The both of 'em recorded a great album. You can listen it from no. 1 to last song and will not skip any song unless you're not in a hurry. I like that album very well, but I'm also very interested in any work of Dr. Dre, so that makes me more interested in this album too. But it doesn't mean that you're not gonna enjoy this music. Look just only on the cover and if you like or not, you MUST admit that cover sells for 100%! And the same good is inside. I like that."
1,Garbage...,"""Addictive"" is indeed catchy, if somewhat amateurish (I hope B.T. Express got paid for that sample) but one decent song does not a passable album make. This is precisely why modern soul music, with very few exceptions, has become one big yawn. Truth Hurts and so does listening to this CD!"
3,"different, just not different enough","It is important to realize the critical stage that Urban Music is in. On the one hand, urban music routinely makes appearances in the overall top 10 upon their release, signifying the unversal appeal of urban music. On the other hand, the albums themselves have a paper-doll resemblence. How different is Truth Hurts from Ashanti, Sharissa, or any other lesser known female artist to release an album this year. The answer lies, as it always does in the lyrics and production. The production, of course is solid, with DJ Quik carrying the water under Dr. Dre's nameplate. It is indeed nice to see Quik receiving props for ""Addictive"" now that the album has been released, whereas everyone was pinning credit on Dre. The rest of the album rises and falls almost at random, seldom sinking into the unlistenable range but never quite rising to the level that would make you plunk down 15-18 bucks for a CD."
5,Dre. does it again! Phenomenal!!!,"I can't believe how dope this cd is. From the first song to the last this cd is excellent. This is the best R&B cd i have purchased since i bought Carl Thomas's cd. I am amazed at how many haters their are blatantly lying and calling this cd whack. In a time when most cd's only have one dope track, it is refreshing to hear a complete cd. When i first heard the cd i loved it. I haven't played a cd this much since my miles davis ""kind of blue"" cd. I still haven't taken it out of my cd player. How can a production team that consist of dre, quick, r. kelly, mel man, and timbaland go wrong. It is illogical for one to say this cd is anything, but dope. Tracks 1,2,4,9,10,11, and 13. are extremely dope the other tracks are just very good."
3,"alright, not the best","I thought Truth Hurts cd was alright.She's a great singer but I hope she does a lot better on her sophomore album.My favorites are Addictive, The Truth, and Real. Overall I give this album 3 stars."
3,"I got what I paid for, nothing more, nothing less","This will definately NOT be in my CD player for long. However I do like Addictive and I'm Not Really Looking with DJ Quick, I could've saved money and bought the singles instead. I don't predict much staying power for her in this music business, Dre or no Dre. I suggest she takes the money and run. Got a nice voice though."
4,Truth Hurts the 2nd best thing from Dre.,"Okay the obvious thing is that addictive is a great song im a bit bored of it now but it will be a classic in hip hop and randb, but we have to think of more tyhan just the first single like the 2nd and kless reconizable single the truth feat.Rkelly in my opinion it is better than addictive because she gives alot of attitude which i like in female randb singers, other gems are push play, grown, tired, and hollywood lots of guests apperances especially on songs that are potential singles"
5,Great CD!,"Ever since I heard ""Addictive"" I've loved Truth Hurts!This album is great!It has great songs and Truth's voice make it awesome!I recommend:Any CD by Aaliyah or Eminem!"
3,Return of the Funk,"Truthfully Speaking is one of the more original and interesting CDs to drop this year. Truth Hurts' voice and sound are very distinctive and the album is driven by some bonafide funk. As big as a smash as ""Addictive"" has become, ""I'm Not Really Looking"" is nearly as good and more fun. ""Real"" might be the funkiest thing you'll hear this year. I've kept it on repeat for three days. ""BS"" and ""Jimmy"" pick up right where Lucy Pearl left off. Though Truth keeps a certain edge and attitude throughout the CD she can let her guard down too. On ""Do Me"", Truth is totally vulnerable, lonely, and frustrated. All she wants is a hug and some caressing done right. ""Tired"", ""Queen of the Ghetto"", and ""Hollywood"" meander, misfire, and try one's patience but overall, this is a very funky and refreshing CD. Truth be told, I'm totally addicted."
3,It's decent.,"Decent for the money. The finish is a high polish chrome so it marks up easily. The top is much easier to get off than the Oggi Dial-a-drink shaker, but not as sollid of construction. The biggest downfall of this shaker is that the drink recipies are all mainly old school drinks and not very useful. The Oggi are much more updated and useful. It's a fine piece as a shaker though."
4,Pretty Good,Got this (actually bought 2 on sale for $10 each) about a month ago and have used almost every night so far. No problems and the lid is very easy to get off. Well worth the price paid. Would have given full 5 stars if dishwasher recommended.
1,TOO TOUGH to open if same one from Pottery Barn...,"We received the Pottery Barn Cocktail Shaker as a gift, and if this is the same model (it certainly LOOKS just like it)as another reviewer said, but sold under a different brand, it should be BANNED! It is virtually IMPOSSIBLE to open it to clean it. The small round top cap can be coaxed off...grrrr...but opening the container requires a MAN, A KNIFE, AND A LOT OF ATTITUDE.We still have this cocktail shaker, although I should have returned it as soon as we had used it once.I constantly debate whether to just THROW IT OUT. Better to skip the martinis than to battle with this incredibly poorly made product. A jelly jar would be better than this. Be warned!"
3,Standard as can be.,"Fairly standard compilation with some tracks that outshine others and genrally moves through quite smoothly i like a couple of the tracks with the pedal steel involved, probably worth buying if you find it that bit cheaper."
4,Gift for my adult children,"When my kids were teenagers they watched Saturday Night Live and would ROAR at Jack Handey's Deep Thought spots. For YEARS afterward, they would repeat their favorites to each other and laugh hysterically. So...what better ""stocking stuffer"" than a Deep Thoughts book neither of them had. They both loved it and it started a ""memory session"" bringing up their favorites again! FUN TIMES!"
1,Thin and cheap,These tshirts are as thin as you can imagine. After one wash the neck and arms stretched out unacceptably. I cannot recommend this product.
3,"Good Tees, but...","The tees are ok, but very thin. Extremely thin. Ideal for doing sports or relax at home. I have no problems with the wash machine."
5,A compact book chock-full of tips and unique information!,"This is by far the best book for children and families on attracting birds to your yard. Chock-full of information that is presented in an appealing manner, this book covers a wide range of material to help children and families get started with backyard bird watching. Some of the more unique sections are a directory of plants providing food for birds, a table showing the types of seeds and food eaten by various bird species. There are lots of good color photos, and a variety of projects for children."
5,Super cute!,My 7 year old looked adorable on Halloween and I did not have the hassle of making a costume! Cute and great price!
4,Good replacement for disposable shavers,I have been using disposable shavers for number of years and thought I should try an electric shaver. I think its afantastic choice and the price is cheap too...I have used it for both dry and wet shaing and the results have been as good as the razor. It took some time to experiment with the pressure to be applied and Im still not confrtable using underarms but for daily use and mobiility full points.
3,This thing scares me.,"To echo other reviewers, this is an underarm destroyer, (ok, I'm exaggerating) but on multiple occasions this thing has pinched my underarm. And I don't know how it happens! At first I thought it was the sides of the shaver doing it but seems like it's likely to happen anywhere on the foil. I think maybe it's because my underarm is very soft, but not smooth even though I try to flatten/taut the area with my finger. Well after this happens, my underarm turns red and is irritated and feels like it's been cut, though there is no bleeding. Ugh... I feel that this almost has no benefit over a regular razor (a regular razor has never left my underarm feeling like this before!), as you still have to go over the area multiple times, and in many directions sometimes. I can't even use it everyday because my underarm doesn't recover from the day before. A positive is that this works in the shower. Anyway, I've thrown this out now."
4,Gift for wife,She was pleased although she did say. it does a good job but I believe my old previous remingtonwas just a little better.Hubbie George
2,Poor quality,Broke in no time - such a waste of money. Did not work well and defintely will not be purchasing again --- ugh! Waste of money!
1,junk,this product is junk. 6 weeks old and starts cutting my wife's legs. Prior to that it never gave a close have. Choose the panasonic for $5 more.
2,NOt a good buy,"I bought this razor after reading the good reviews. I was very disappointed. It never did cut the hair well. I thought maybe the blades were dull, so I replaced them I still have the same results. I cannot use a regular razor as I use blood thinners and I had hopes this would do the job."
1,do not buy,was tired of spending $18 for 8 cartridges for venus disposables so i tryed the remington smooth and silky electric.. i love my close shaves with my razors and was hoping to get it outta the electric.. i had to go over the same spot 5x before i got all the hairs and it still was prickly i tried both wet and dry.. glad i saved the receipt was $38 and im bringing it back and buying the best razor out there. talk about piss me off.. waste of time to even try it out and besides you have to have a razor to get the down under region..
2,Painful,"This product is alright. It is probably the best one on the market at a cheap price, but I stopped using it after two months because it just burns! I just got a little edge tool for bikini lines instead. It is a lot smaller (philips brand) so I would not really recommend it for legs, but it works find for everywhere else. My new one is very effective and does not hurt like this one did. Oh, and it says you can use it wet or dry, but it is pretty much better dry because then it doesn't stick to your skin as much. Does fine on your legs, though."
4,Great Buy,"I love this new razor. I had a Remington WDF-5500 Smooth & Silky Ladies Shaver for 3 years and it just died. It was a good razor too but the battery life was not very long. I charge my new razor for the recommended 18 hours and I was able to shave my legs and bikini area. My other one wouldn't have lasted that long. Another difference with this one is I used it a few days after I had charged it and it lasted again to shave my legs and bikin area. I was really impressed by that. It gives you a close shave, but obviously not as close as a razor. I loved it and definitely recommend it. Oh and I have had no razor burn in sensitive areas."
3,Okay for the price,"Bought this product for my daughter. It was good for the amount of time that it lasted, around 4 months. The reason why I purchased it was because it took the same replacement heads and foil of my Ladies Remington Rechargeable shaver. Wished that it would have lasted longer than it did."
2,Remington WDF1600,"Product stopped holding a charge, long enough to use it, 3 months after the two year warranty expired.On/off button is in a bad location."
2,Ok-A little dissapointed,"I bought this, thinking that is was going to be better than regular shaving. I was really let down by the product. I thought I got a better shave using a razor. Wish I hadn't spent all that money on it and not being able to use it. Think I will just stick to regular shaving instead."
5,Love this Razor,"This is one of the better razors that I have bought, Keeps your legs smooth for days and easy to operate."
4,good bye razor burn,"I wasn't too sure about this product before I bought it but Im glad I did. I do not get the razor burn any more. It did take a several days before the razor gave me a closer shave. I tried underarm shaving...won't do that again, OUCH...It works with or without shaving cream. In the tub too!.."
4,Great for the price!,"I have been looking for an electric shaver for the past year because I hate shaving with a razor! To be honest I only shave like once or twice a week because I'm lazy and hate shaving. I have had this one for just about a month now and the shaver does a very good job although it doesn't get my legs as smooth as a razor. For the price it's totally worth buying!Simple to use and cleaning is a breeze! (Per another reviewer, how in the world do you get a ""razor burn"" from an electric shaver??)"
3,Not so good...,"I got this product because I have sensitive skin and hate razor bumps that I get with a regular blade. Ive had this now for about a month or so, and I use it every other day.I dont think I would buy this again, honestly. I dont know if there's some special tecnique for this, but it just doesnt get the hairs. I can tell it has shaved a little, but no matter how many times I go over and over it just doesnt feel smooth, and it always misses hairs, no matter what I do. I paid around $30 for this with S&H.; Maybe if you find this for like $5 bucks I would say go ahead and try it, but I wouldnt reccomend it otherwise."
2,remington shaver,I bought this shaver hoping it would be like my old one but it isn't. I have to go over the same area several times before it cuts all the hairs. I think the mesh screen on the shaver needs to have larger openings or the blades need to be brought closer to the surphase. I'm not very happy with it but it will do for now. I think next times I'll go a little more expensive and see if it does a better job. When it does finally get all or most of the hair it is smooth. mixed emotions on this item.
3,"Too Narrow, Doesn't hold charge for long","The head on this could be wider - I couldn't tell how narrow it would be from the photo. I have tried it but it doesn't seem to be very powerful, and I feel like it needs a charge before I'm halfway done.Maybe I just require something with a little more oomph. I'll be ordering something else to replace this one. What I really want is a corded women's shaver but apparently nobody sells those any more. I'm just tired of the battery dying when the shaver isn't even that old."
5,Great shave,"For many years I went the traditional shaving route - a safety razor in the shower with a foaming shaving gel. The process was tedious, uncomfortable, a waste of water, and it sometimes left me with cuts or a rash. I tried waxing more than once but it was messy, painful, time-consuming, and inefficient. I tried an electric epilator, but it broke too many hairs (leaving my legs with constant stubble), and it caused many ingrown hairs even though I exfoliated regularly. Recently I tried THIS inexpensive little shaver. Lo and behold, it gives such an easy and smooth shave! No downside whatsoever. I like to use it dry (not in the shower). I don't need any ancillary products such as shaving gel or an exfoliator. This product produces a fast, trouble-free, smooth shave every time. After a few initial re-charges it now holds a charge for about 5 full shaves. I always discharge it completely before recharging. No need to look further, this is now THE shaver for me."
5,Very happy customer!!,The product arrived promptly. It was better than expected. Thanks for your great service.
2,The charger stops working 3 months after purchasing,"When I just got it, I think it's very good, though a bit noisy. But after using it 2-3 times per week for three months, the charger stops working. The shaver cannot get charged and of course stops working gradually too. I think a 50+ dollar product should not have quality like this!"
2,its alright,"this was sort of an impulse buy, but it worked amazingly... for the first two months. a few weeks into using it, a rip developed in the protective screen. a few weeks later, halfway through shaving, the screen came clean off. obviously, i can't use it anymore, so im looking for a different, better electric razor."
4,Good replacement choice,"The replacement blades for my old Remington razor were getting too expensive, so I thought this brand new razor would be a good choice. I am thrilled! I am getting a closer shave and the razor lasts about 10 days on a single charge. This will be a good feature when I travel, less to pack. The only draw back is the on-off switch is really touchy and the re-charge light is very bright, plus there is no carrying case but my old one fits just fine."
3,You get what you paid for.,"I had this shaver for about 2 1/2 years, only because it fell and broke. But I will say that this works descent enough on your legs, yes you do have to go over the same area about 2 or 3 times, which can be consuming, so by the time you get to your other leg, you better be quick because the battery will run out or start slowing down. This is not good to shave over sensitive skin or creases of any kind, it will turn red, and get those dreadful razor bumps, just stick to legs. Very easy to clean, and it works in the shower. If you are looking for something affordable, I recommend you buy it. Personally, it was a gift and I never minded having to shave over the same area, but I did mind that annoying battery if I was in a rush."
1,Never buying Remington again!!!,I just tried this Remington Smooth & Silky rechargeable shaver is terrible. My Mom & I both tried it & got razor burns no matter how gently or what way we tried it. The Remington didn't shave off the hair well & left burns!!! My 20 year old Chick electric shaver still works better than this Remington!!! I can't believe it. So is there a decent electric shaver for legs & arm pits out there for low price?
1,waste of money,"I ordered it to use outside US, and there is not mention in description that this razor works only in north america. so it simpy does not charge :("
4,Razor works good,"So far it works well, but the directions say that it will take several uses before you get a real close shave."
4,Very smooth,"I have wanted a shaver of my own for some time now and now I do. The reviews of this shaver was a deciding factor for me. I got it and tried it once. It was very smooth, no more buring and itching. Thank God."
5,great women's shaver for the price,If your looking for a women's shaver that will be gentle on your legs this is the shaver to buy. I have psoriasis and it is difficult to find a shaver that doesn't nick and cut. I was surprised for the price that this shaver does what it says it will. In past I have had difficulty finding a good product for my condition.I gave it 5 stars because it exceeds expectations.
5,grrrreat!,Love this shaver. First time I used it I couldn't believe it. It shaved closer than a blade!! Why didn't i get this ages ago!!!
1,painful!!,My first time using this I got terrible razor burn. I thought I would give it a few more chances considering sometimes they say you have to get used to a razor. Well several uses later and it is not any better. It's alright for the legs (still misses a lot and you have to shave several times in the same area to get a clean shave) but the underarms are unbearable! I am going to try to return this and find another.
4,Satisfied with shaver,"I received the shaver in great condition. It arrived quickly after I purchased it and I am for the most part satisfied. It works well for my legs, but is too rough for my underarms. Overall, this was a positive transaction."
1,It doesn't work !!!!!,"I dont know what the other reviewers are talking about. This product does not work I am indian, and maybe i have thicker hair than usual. Still, it doesn't do even a passable job!"
5,Great shaver,I bought this item about a month ago. It definately lives up to it's name. Smooth and Silky. I had been debating about purchasing one and came across this one and decided to give it a try. I love it. It leaves your skin feeling soft without moisturizer. I recommend it if you are thinking about buying one.
2,Disappointing,"I am no longer able to shave my underarms do to health reasons, so I now have to use an electric shaver. After reading the reviews, I purchased this one. The first time I tried it in the shower, it pulled and pinched a lot. I followed the directions and wasn't using much pressure at all. It really irritated my underarms and it lasted for several days. I tried it again with the same results. I do have very curly hair and that might have some impact on the the shaver's performance. Since this is my first experience with an underarm electric shaver, I don't know if this is normal--but I'll definitely be looking for another one. Gave it two stars because it looks and feels good and seems to be a good product--just doesn't work for me."
2,Razor Burn?,"I don't think I have particularly sensitive skin, but I experience what seems to be ""razor burn"" when using this. I have tried using less pressure with no improvement. It does hold a charge well, and it's pretty, but I won't be using it anymore."
2,Not good for sensitive skin.,"I purchased the razor as due to lipedema I cannot use a regular razor. I have only had this razor for a few months and it caused bumps with even light pressure. But recently a wire had popped up and really cut my legs up, which is not good with lipedema. Sadly i cannot recommend this razor. I gave it 2 stars as it might work better with normal skin."
5,Best electric shaver,"I love this shaver. It charges quickly and stays charged. It removes leg hair painlessly without leaving stubbles. The grip is easy to use and it is easy to clean. I travel with it as well. I didn't find it that helpful for removing underarm hair but it is fantastic for the entire leg, leaving a soft smooth feel to the touch."
1,Not worth it.,More effort that using a traditional razor. Not a close shave at all. Wasn't worth my time.
1,waste of money,the charger breaks very easily and it takes more than a day to charge. and the shaver tends to not pick up hairs in different directions. save your money and buy a guy's shaver instead.
2,Cheaply Made,"I have used this a few times. And when I opened it to empty the hair, the pieces all fell apart. It doesn't come apart and go back together easily. The pieces should have never fell apart. I will attempt to return it and get a better one.Wish me luck!"
1,received an old product and Remington sent an old replacement,"The shavers contain nickle, which can make some people have a black footprint problem on the skin. Unfortunately, both shavers I've been sent are old."
2,Shaved well BUT item was defective.,On the first use the razor shaved fine. During the second use the grills head cut through the grill making the unit useless. I returned the unit and amazon did a great job with the return.
5,"excellent, non abrasive, long lasting","My legs were breaking out from a straight edge razor and my dermatologist did not know why. When I started using the Remington shaver, my legs did not break out--the razor gave too close of a shave even after showers. I told my dermatologist the solution! after using two steriod creams and several doctor visits. The Remington shaver lasted for years, like ten years or more. I love it and highly recommend it. I purchased the Smooth and Silky because my first Remmington gave out last month; it is a similar model to my first one.Remington WDF-1600 Smooth & Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable"
3,works fine for my first shaver,i always wanted to buy a shaver. so i bought this one it's pretty good for the price but the wet feature sucked for me i tried it in the shower and i didn't get a good enough shave as i did when i used it out of the shower. so i recommend only using the dry feature or just try a different shaver altogether.
5,Fabulous! I love it!,"I love this thing - and for the price, it's a steal!! I got it after getting tired of constantly cutting myself in my bikini area shaves. It was getting so bad I was thinking about just getting laser. Then I tried this thing... It's fantastic!!! It does have a little pull, like a pinch really, but the more I use it, the less I feel it, even on the most sensitive areas. No more cuts, my skin feels SO smooth, I REALLY love it!! Very highly recommended."
5,works for me!!!,"This is exactly what I needed - a quick option to lathering up.It works fine for me and for what I wanted. I don't find it harsh or painful. It is the perfect "" going out the door"" shaver - no nicks to worry about either."
2,Not a very close shave,"I've been using this razor for about six months now and I find that I don't get as close a shave as I did with the Remington WDF-6000. The only reason I did not buy another 6000 after that one died after 3 years of use (it would no longer take a charge) was that I wanted to try something different and a little cheaper. I'm sorry I didn't get the 6000, for it was a closer shave than this 1600. Also, the 6000 has an indicator that the battery needs charging, which is a nice feature.On the positive side, the 1600 hasn't had any problems charging, and the charge lasts awhile. It's also easy to grip and hold."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this back in Feb., and loved it the first 2-3 times I used it. Then it started taking longer, and longer to shave and in sometimes it wouldn't do anything at all. I was constantly cleaning it, thinking that might be the problem but it wasn't. I got fed up taking so much time and patience plus it started to irritate my legs.I read so many good reviews on here and took a few weeks of reading and researching before buying it, I was really disappointed."
1,Died after a few minutes,"It is probably a good shaver (works well) based on the reviews here but with poor quality control. Given the low price of most consumer products these days, only the least expensive materials are used.If you are lucky, it might work well for years. So beware and keep the box and be prepared to return it if it dies prematurely."
2,Could be better,"This model lasted me about 14 months. it gave a good shave, however, battery gave out after 14 months."
4,good shaver,"Works as advertized. A bit noisier than the Norelco roatary shaver I was using ... but this Remington WDF-1600 shaves close and pretty quick so the noise is tolerable.Will update this review after some service life experience, like how long does the screen last, which is usually the weakness of foil shavers.Remington WDF-1600 Smooth & Silky Ultra Shaver, Rechargeable"
3,OK for the price,This is a necessary item for grooming and it works just fine. Happily it was also inexpensive and had the features (such as rechargeable) that matter to me.
4,Electric Razor for women-great but not amazing,"The product came in packaging, perfect condition, charges good, definitely chargefor like a day when you first get it so it is fully powered. My legs adjusted fine to it, I only had redness the first time, others say up to three weeks. I like the razor alot, but I expected a bit of a closer shave from it, it hasn't givenme that much of a closer shave, but maybe if i let the hair grow longer ( I don't want it to grow longer thats why I have the razor?). either way content for the most part."
2,Not very good at all -- rotary shavers are way better at cutting hair,I bought this because of everyone else's reviews-But after trying it out -didn't like it at all.. It doesn't cut well at all - you have to go over the same spot over and over -because the hair needs to get into one of the many holes in the screen in order to get cut & the charge doesn't last long either---- so it takes you longer to shave & the battery dies about half way through... I am gonna get a mens rotary norelco instead
3,OK shaver for the price,"This shaver works fine, though not as well as my older Norelo, which recently died. The price was right."
5,harry potter good or bad?,"I am using mom's computer I am 9. I rated the game 5* because I am pretty sure it will be good, here are my thougths for the other five ***** max:computer gameboy Ds1 *** * -none-2 ***** *** -none-3 **** **** -none-4 ????? ????? ?????It is going to be the first game I am going to get. I've seen the movie clip and I liked it.LucasAugust 7, 2005"
3,Stumbling Block for Advancement,"If you're into the Harry Potter adventures, you anticipate exciting adventures. This game starts out well, but at one point, you can't go further. There is no help, nor hint to guide you through this impasse. This leaves you frustrated and disappointed. I would not recommend buying this game!"
2,confusing!,"This game is mega confusing in the beginning! They tell you nothing about where you are how you got there,ect. At first, I had no clue why they were at the Quidditch world cup! The Triwizard tournament is another thing. before I read the book I thought Harry got in the Triwizard thing of his own free will! The dialog was another big disappointment. The only things the charcters actually say is Come here and Help me. Everything else is just words and pictures. The big 'Round up all the animals at Hagrid's hut thing' is probaly the hardest part of the game. I STILL have not beaten it. The Forbidden Forest and Prefects bathroom were boring, unlike the movie,AND hard! The only thing worth playing were the mini-games and that whole ""Here's a niffler, take care of it."" thing."
4,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"I bought this for my girl, she liked but not as much as other games of the same type."
3,Mediocre all around,"I have to give them credit--the graphics are great. But that's the only thing. I liked the old harry potter gameboy games because there was actually a storyline and puzzles to figure out--in this one, all you do is wander around similar screens zapping things over and over. It gets tedious real fast. The controls also aren't very intuitive, and there are spots where the animation gets a bit choppy. I really like all the harry potter books, movies, and previous games, but I thought this was just plain boring."
4,Nintendo DS Harry Potter & Goblet of Fire review,"Out of all the Harry Potter games I've played (Game Boy Advance and DS games), this one is hands down my favorite. You have to go through the levels, completing different tasks, learning spells as you go and looking for treasure chests that contain collector cards. If you collect all the cards in a certain section, your power is increased. The objective in the game is to collect all the cards before your final showdown in the graveyard with Lord Voldemort. I like that you have to play some levels multiple times after you have unlocked certain spells......so you can unlock doors or unblock sections that were previously unavailable to you at your (then) skill level. My only complaint is that you have to complete the WHOLE level to be able to save your progress......there is no saving and returning midway thru a level.....so it can be time consuming. Overall....love the game!!"
1,Save your money,"Everyone within ear shot of your child will hate you. As well, I had a pair of these and was unimpressed with the quality. Additionally, when I had an inquiry for this company, their customer service was rude, disrespectful, and most unhelpful even though I mentioned how unquie their product seemed and was most pleasant to them. Invest in a quality shoe without the extra 'bells and whistles"" who puts their customers first."
4,"Great idea, hope it works well when I need it.",We just replaced a dining room light and had alot of problems with the chain links. We hope the next time this tool will come in handy.
5,Fantastic album,A great way to revisit classic Dr. John. Remastered for amazing sound with a TON of bonus tracks...this is a fantastic album for any Dr. John fan or someone looking to get into his stuff. Definitely pick it up!
2,Boring bar music,"I bought the CD because I was looking for piano music and this one was highly recommended by reviewers. Well, it sure is one boring piece of work! I somehow missed reference on the music style. So, to you all who may be doing the same mistake: it is a blues music for bars. Go out Friday night and you'll have a great chance to hear the same music: the never-ending stream of notes to make you feel unworried and thirsty. Nothing great nor ""legendary"" about it really. It has something specifically American about it that I find difficult to relate to: too common, too simple, too simpleminded, too shortcoming. Sorry, but using piano for instrument doesn't make the music great; the melodies could have been played on harmonica or accordion instead and sold as folk-music."
1,Doesn't even cover the basics,"I'm a beginning Italian student, and I can't find the words I need, even though my lessons are introductory level. Steer clear of this book."
3,Mixed Review,"So far I have watched two Miss Marple episodes. Mirror Cracked was fine, though all have suffered from faded colors over time. Caribbean Mystery was fine except for a 5-10 minute section in which the audio was about 1 second out of sync with the video, which was really annoying. Luckily it flipped back to normal on its own after a few minutes, and I could concentrate on the story once again. I am hoping that was the only disc which was defective."
3,The Agatha Christie megaset collection(Mis Marple/Poirot),"I must say I brought these items because I love British mystries. Growing up I have read the books but never seen the movies. The Hercule Poirot mysteries was most interesting, he has a way of keeping you in suspense and keep you wanting to watch more, I total enjoy watching his series. I would recommend buying any of the Poirot series. I did enjoy Miss Marple but the pace of it was a little slow for me, there are a few funny moments where Mis marple meets detective Slack, this was most enjoyable. I recommend ""450 from paddington"", Nemesis""and ""murder at the vicarage"", in the Miss Marple series."
1,Don't waste your time and money!,"As a fan of time-travel books I'm wondering why I'm even giving this one star. There was no substance to the story just lots of fluf. I'm sorry, but there is no way someone arrives in the 20th Century from the 14th Century and takes everything in stride as the two main characters did in this story. How does Viviene get a paycheck without a SS#? AND she and Niall can read modern-day English with no trouble? It wasn't very realistic. Also, I don't like stories that make sure EVERYONE in the story has found a love in the last 5 pages!"
1,Boring dialogue...,This story contained some of the most boring and dumbest narration. It bored me and I skipped from the begining to the end and got the full sense of the story. Her other books were better.
2,cookie cutter,kind of boring especially after you read a few of her books. Do not think I will read any more of her books.
3,Always love Claire Delacroix,It's a Claire Delacroix book - I like her writing and style but this book dragged a bit and seemed too long.
2,This book really is bad,I bought this book to help me with learning a little more about the java standard libraries but really all this book does is list the methods and interfaces in the class libraries nothing more nothing less.You can find the same info at the Sun website for free. There are a few examples of how to use somethings in the book but generally you are only given the name of the class and the methods in it. I was really disappointed with this book.
2,Waste of money and time,"This book does not cover all Java 1.2 although it claims to do so. It states on the back cover:""Detailed description, syntax and code examples for...Java.lang"", which is not covered at all. The structure of the content is poor. It is difficult to find what one wants even if it is there. The book describing how to use this one needs to be enclosed. Luckily most of book shops nowadays including Amazon(thank you very much guys) have efficient return policy. There is plenty of other books on the market that cover java libraries the way it should be done."
4,Great reference book,"This book is great as reference,all who criticized it do not know what is this book about.This aint no tutorial book,this is a reference book,I have a good back ground with C++,I found it waste of time to read tutorial books,so I went to the book store and grabbed it off the shelf,its great,I rate it 4 start just because of some types,if you have good knowledge of programming,then this is teh book for you..all what you need it to know what methods and member varibales for which class and your ready to go,plus some neat examples."
5,Very Pleased,"I was very pleased when we received this item. My son is a big fan of ""Cars"" and was ecstatic to have thing to decorate his room with. I was happy that it was reasonably priced and is something that can easily be passed on to another child when he outgrows this interest."
2,A Disappointing Waste of Talent,"Connolly is a marvelous writer, but this book is marred by the use of ghosts to move along the plot. It's a pleasure to read someone as gifted as Connolly in creating characters, describing place, and portraying genuine conversations. But when the story requires belief in ghosts I lose interest.Others have described the gore in the book, and that can be a turnoff for squimish readers. I can handle the blood--that's possible; I can't handle the supernatural--there is no such stuff. Too bad Connolly wasted his writing skills with a story that's only for the fantasy-minded."
4,Appetizing,"An interesting blend of ingredients: a dash of history, a pinch of the occult, and a healthy cuff of murder. This novel is an ambitious literary soufle. Most authors would flatten it into fare thinner than an IHOP pancake.Connolly however manages to raise our expectation.Suspend your disbelief. Savor this mystery with the lights turned low and silence your surroundings."
4,"The synopsis sounded good, so I read it:","... and couldn't put it down. I was aware that this was a horror story, but was really pleased at how the author plotted the story to mix tangible and supernatural evil and bring it to a logically explosive conclusion ... and the supernatural was arguably not ""evil."" I was definitely rooting for the gray people. The horror wasn't in the ghosts seeking revenge, but in the bad men; you couldn't expect ANYBODY to survive if they crossed paths with these people and that stressed me. Knowing that these and others like them really exist and any one of us can walk right into that kind of nightmare at anytime ... well that had me checking the locks at night and wanting Jesus to come (and FIX us)!! Oh, and a sweet ending."
4,"My first John Connolly,stand alone...","...didn't dissapoint me.I ""discovered"" Connolly,searching some used books at the library.I've now read all of the Charlie Parker books. Being he's Irish,Connolly shows his knowledge/history(study) of Maine and the local towns,I find real interesting. Bad Men,part mystery/supenmatural....are some bad people.He goes back to the old myths,to today real smooth. I really enjoyed Connolly describing how Marianne,ran away from her scary/abusive/controlling husband(Moloch).Sherrif Joe Dupree,a giant of a man,living in a ""normal"" world,was easy to feel for him.Molochs ""companions"",(which you wouldn't want to look at wrong) were some real mean individuals. This was a good quick read from a gifted thriller writer....I can't wait for the next Parker book!!!"
3,"A lot of value for the student, a lot of work for the instructor","I am using this textbook in my college (Math Education majors) Higher Geometry class this semester. The book is very good, it covers very relevant and interesting topics, and is by far the cheapest textbook ever. However as the instructor, I have to spend hours to look up the prerequisites from high school needed to understand all of the theorems. This is true mostly of Chapter One. Often times a five line proof in the textbook takes most of the hour to present properly in the classroom because most of the steps are missing. For the students this is a great deal if the instructor does all the work; for the instructor, a book that would cover the same subjects but with full proofs and a ""prerequisites"" section would be much more helpful. We are however all fans of the hints in the back of the book to solve the end of section problems."
2,Not pristine condition,"Pretty disappointing. This notebook isn't used or anything but it looks scruffy and dirty, like it's been hanging around and handled for quite a while. Doesn't look very good to give as a gift."
4,Favorite of my 3 yr old Cinderalla fan,"I bought this for my 3 year-old who adores Cinderella in any form. She loves putting the furniture and characters in the rooms and quickly learned to navigate. She does get a little frustrated when she can't put the furniture precisely where she wants it. Not a lot of learning value, but has really helped her gain control of the mouse and learn basic computer skills. Otherwise, just fun and entertaining for a very young one. She'll outgrow this before she turns 5, I'm sure"
1,Not for limited users on XP which kids should be.,"I also should have read the reviews on this however, my Daughter loves this game. I do not have the problems with sound or graphics as they are very clear on our system. However, my 4 year old now has to have Administrator rights on the system in order to play this game. I bought XP so I could allow the kids functionality on the computer without me hovering over them. I studied how to set the system up for limited users and Administrators (which can do everything), but now all that work and the money for the product are gone. I have made my complaint with Disney as they are the ones that informed me that they have no intention on changing this product."
4,solid and entertaining for ~5 year olds,"My daughter (4 going on 5) has had a lot of fun with this. For the price and relative to a lot of other similar products, I'm happy with the depth and quality. The review suggesting ""negative stars"" is completely off base - this is game software, and isn't intended to impart deep education. The review giving one star simply because it must be run in admin mode is also short-sighted - knocking the whole product simply because of a common OS incompatibility is silly (I'd say more than half of our children's software suffers from this)."
5,Series just keeps getting better and better,"This series just keeps getting better and better. Can't wait to read the next one. One particular chapter was about a lady who found her happy place in this world, but it didn't last long enough. A chapter that caused tears for me since I get into my reading and feel the emotions of the characters. That's all I'll say so I don't spoil the story for anyone. Surprises in every book and we learn more about the main characters. Can't say enough good things about these books."
2,"OK, but not as good as 1st two",I loved the 1st book and enjoyed the Reunion book. This book was not as well written- The characters/chapters were more like multiple short stories. I wish they would have gone more in depth on past characters.
2,Does not fit all the cars that it says it does,"I am sure the product is great. It looks well made and by a well known company. That said, this part does not fit my car. I used the ""make sure it fits"" feature however this part is no where near matching the holes/ports for my Corolla."
4,Joe Dolce is the finest recording artist of the 20th Century,"Musician, philosopher and master of political satire. How is it possible that Nietzsche wrote ""Zarathustra"" having never met Joe Dolce? Buy this -- you will not regret it."
3,Helpful Resource,"When people visit a church it is normally because they have a need of some kind. A well timed visit from someone in the congregation can really help them overcome their issue or difficulty.This book gives a basic explanation of why, how, when and what to say/do during a visit.Because this book only covers the basics, it would need to be supplemented by other works such as:Serving in Church VisitationPastoral Visitation (Creative Pastoral Care and Counseling)Pastoral Visitation Pocket ManualDeveloping Leadership Teams in the Bivocational Church"
5,Shalimar,The product was as advertised and was shipped in good time. I will use this seller in the future.
5,Memory,"I bought this so I could remember my grandmother. She used to wear this when going out. The fragrance would last a long time and would linger. Instead of just spraying it to smell to capture the memories, I now wear it. It's a classic fragrance to wear."
4,"Wonderful scent, pretty bottle, enduring classic","I've used this perfume since forever - 100 years, Lord willing. Sister, mom, daughter too!! - - - it becomes your ""signature"" scent, particularly if you can wear the pure perfume instead of the cologne because it lasts longer. (use only a tiny bit, or you will overwhelm the room and all around you) All in all, Shalimar gets a big FIVE STAR rating from me.The powder and lotion are of very high quality and packaged/mailed perfectly. I do not care for the Eau de Toilette - but this is only a personal preference.Prices are all over the scale, so shop at several malls, department stores, etc. Amazon has good prices, depending on which store, of course.Susan, from the southern USA"
5,A great glimpse into X-men history.,"This novel shows one of the highlight eras of the X-Men. From Lockheed's debut, to Rogue's joining of the X-Men, to Cyclops' marriage to Madeline Pryor, to Ororo's personality change, so much is chronicled in this novel. Any X-men fan needs to collect this novel; his collection would simply not be complete."
4,It works!,"It takes at least two thick coats, but magnets stick and are capable of holding sheets of paper in place. Be aware though, this is very dark graphite colored paint and I can't imagine painting over it."
5,Magnets stick!,"Love love love this idea and product! My daughter wanted a wall that she could hang stuff on, so she got this paint as a gift. She painted it on and voila...instantly magnetic. The only down side would be if you had a light colored room...it would take several coats to cover, as it's dark grey. Fortunately, her room was already grey at the time. I just repainted to a slightly lighter color...it took 2 coats to cover and the wall seems to hold the magnets even better now. It's just a fun idea and I'm looking to do more areas of the house!"
3,good for smaller stuff,I bought this stuff for an art space where I sometimes hang my paintings.We painted four coats of the paint.I had hoped to be able to hang unframed works on paper without using tacks.We tried it with those little high power magnets.The bigger stuff tended to want to slide off the wall...but the smaller stuff ( say 1' x 2' and smaller) seemed to stay up okay.I also sometimes use magnetic sheets to make car magnets.Those work really well on the paint.
3,too dark,"I was skeptical. The reviews I had read were mixed but also gave advice on how to make this primer work. I followed all of the guidelines as best I could (frequent mixing, smooth roller, multiple coats, rare earth magnets), and I had a strong magnetic surface when the primer coats were complete. However, the final guideline - only one coat of paint over the primer - was impossible. This primer is very dark - think chalkboard gray. It is very difficult to cover. I had to use 2-3 coats of paint over the top, which considerably weakened the magnetic effects. I can still get single sheets of paper to stay up when held by multiple rare earth magnets, but I had hoped for better.My advice - if you have a lot of time to apply the primer carefully and have a very dark color scheme, you'll probably be successful. If you aren't interested in compulsively painting multiple smooth layers or don't intend to use battleship gray in the surface coat, you should save your time and money."
2,Works great...for a while,"I absolutely loved this corkscrew when I first got it about a year ago. It made opening wine bottles effortless. However, after about a year it has broken and doesn't pull the cork out. If you buy this product, just be aware that to replace it, you need to pay them $10 for return shipping, and you have to ship it to them yourself."
2,Disappointment,"My mother has one and it is made from aluminum. My girlfriend and I are huge wine lovers so I thought this would be a great gift. Appears to be identical to the aluminum one in this picture but instead is composed of cheap plastic. Although it has not broken, one and only wonder when. Very disappointed at the lack of craftsmanship for the price. Not a quality item. But it does work hence the two stars instead of one."
1,Poor quality and false advertisement,The information stated that the product was new and never used. The actual product had scratches and stains from wine. It was gross. I wound up keeping the product and washing it thoroughly. I didnt want to go through the hassle of shipping fees. I figured it would take more time and money then it was worth. Very unhappy with the condition of product.
1,Try something simple,"I got set as a gift. Before one buys it, they should try to remove a cork from the machine after it's removal from bottle. If it's a real cork, it should only take five minutes or so. If it's plastic, you'll have to get some vise-grip pliars. I no longer use it at all."
1,I can't review this item!,"I cannot provide a review for this item because it hasn't arrived yet. I purchased it a month ago and it was supposed to be here in time for Christmas since it is a present for my dad. They told me it would be to me between the 18th and 23rd of December. It's now the middle of January and I have written the company, but no one has gotten back to me.DO NOT buy from this company!!!"
4,Nice Wine Opening Kit...Good gift to give,"I gave this to my sister for X-mas. She's an avid wine drinker and thus opens a lot of bottles. She said she really likes it. As for the other tools, she likes the anti-drip ring. I was going to get an electric wine bottle opener, but heard they aren't always reliable."
5,"Great corkscrew, great gift.","I've been using these Metrokanes for several years now and I wouldn't want to use anything else. They make absolutely anyone look like a pro opening a bottle of wine, while of course at the same time avoiding the occasional broken cork plunged into the bottle horror.Whenever we have guests, they always comment on the Metrokane, and as a result I've found it makes a perfect gift. In particular, this silver model is extremely attractive."
2,it's too cheap!,"I bought both this and the similar version from Brookstone this year. I was expecting a lot from the metrokane, but it turns out the Brookstone is much better. It's $60, but the Brookstone version will last you MUCH longer than the $45 metrokane.Among the differences: The metrokane is made of plastic, the Brookstone is metal. The Brookstone model comes with two bottle sealers, and it's case is made of very high quality leather-like material instead of cheap plastic. Finally, my metrokane is brand new, and I've already managed to scratch the finish, since it's so cheap.If you're looking to get a new wine opener, do yourself a favor and BUY ANOTHER BRAND."
1,Rabbit wine opener,"We bought the Metrokane opener after going through a few other openers. After reading the reviews we bought the Metrokane. We were very pleased with the rabbit until today--less than a year of owning it the handle broke in two. We live in 'wine country "" in CA and we open a bottle a day. I will definitely be looking for a different opener. Our rabbit handles are plastic but look like they are metal. From what I have heard the metal ones are great but you need to be aware of what you are ordering. Buyer beware!!"
3,Too Much Plastic,"I bought this for my husband for father's day. He writes: ""Good concept but not well built. Too much plastic in the handles and it bends quite a bit when the cork is tight. I sometimes need to use traditional - lever style - metal cork screw for fear of breaking this one."" 2.5 stars"
2,Silver Rabbit not so ScrewPull'd,"I had a Le Crueset Screwpull, got a Metrokane Rabbit for a wedding gift,sent my screwpull awayand the Rabbit done died in less than 9 months. I have emailed the CEO riki@metrokane.comand they want a $10 warranty kick.Screwpull replaced my unit 6 years into the bargain no questions asked.No response from Metro=rabbit.buy the Screwpull!"
4,a great product and good quality,I needed an new wine bottle opener and found this on Amazon.com at a good price and fast delivery.
2,It works but feels flimsy,I guess I'm a little disappointed with this item. I received one as a gift a couple of years ago and I loved it so much I purchased this one to give as a Christmas gift this year. The one I received a couple of years ago feels much sturdier than the new one. The new one seems to be made of metal colored plastic instead of metal like my old one. It still removes a cork fairly easily it just feels like it will not be long before it breaks.
1,Barbie Doll--Cute but useless,"I bought this because my ten-year-old, all-metal, rabbit-type wine-opener finally quit. Was looking forward to seeing how the engineering had advanced and discovered first that this opener weighed about half that of its predecessor; second, that the newer one exerted about half the strength; and third, that the cork-release action failed to work at all. This is a cheap, plastic version of the original at at least twice the price. Look elsewhere. The additional accessories seem efficient, but they're not why I bought the package."
4,Wine opner review,I found the product easy to use and the additional stoppers were an extra bonus. The quality of the product along with the warranty should provide me with many years of enjoyment.
5,Love it!,Best wine opener I've owned! Makes opening the wine a quick and easy task. Wish I would have found this earlier.
3,Not the quality expected,"Purchased as a gift for someone that used to own a Rabbit wine opener. Disappointed to find that this model is not near the quality of the one previously owned. This model feels very light/flimsy. Appears to work ok (however, not quite as well as the previous model), just concerned that it will not last very long."
2,Worked fine for awhile,"I bought this three years ago and it worked fine for about 5 or 6 months. Then it became more and more difficult to extract and release the corks. Finally, after even my husband struggled to work it, I replaced the worm. But that only helped for a few months until super-human strength was once again required. It works fairly well if the wine cork is not in tight but it's not good on tight corked bottles. A word of caution: When you are releasing the cork, make sure your finger is not between the trigger and the handle when the trigger comes down to meet the handle. It requires so much downward force that I have bruised my hand several times when the lever came down hard on my knuckle. I hope by now they have made some engineering improvements on this wine opener."
4,Good,The packaging was not in perfect condition but it was delivered on-time and the product itself was great!! Thanks! Would definitely buy again!
2,long and drawn out,"As a Laurens fan I couldn't wait for this book! Well, I should have kept on waiting. Sorry to say, it took my days upon days to get throught this book. The first hundred pages or so seemed to be slow dry reading. The characters aren't that well developed and are lacking her usual flare. The plot could have amounted to a more exciting story if we didn't have to keep reading about the lack of [physical relations] in Caro's first marriage."
4,Mediocre Laurens fare,"I am a big fan of Stephanie Laurens' but this book was just OK. The political talk and positioning got boring after a while but what I really objected to was the lame reason that was given for the fact that the main character was a virgin widow (her first husband, much older, decided that he could never satisfy her so he didn't make the attempt - even though he kept a mistress on the side!). Why did Laurens make her a virgin? If she felt she had to, then why not make up a better excuse (e.g. he wanted to keep her perfect with the rest of the antiques in his town house, or he was physically incapable at his age, or he had a STD and didn't want to taint her).She therefore doesn't think she has sex appeal but this issue is only alluded to but never really hashed out. It would have been better if the hero had reassured her verbally instead of just being randy all the time.It's not a bad book, better than most other regency romances out there but not Stephanie Laurens' best effort."
2,Not One Of My Favorites,"I love most of Stephanie Laurens books, but this was not one of them. It was a long drawn out story that really didn't have any excitement to it. It lost all its ""cynster"" qualities. Maybe if Michael was more of a ""rake"", like the Cynster males, this book might have had a chance at excitement. I also think the Cynster family should have been involved more, afterall that is where it all began. Still, I looking forward to Stephanie Laurens next installment to the Cynster family."
3,Not her best,"I love the early Cynster novels, especially Devil's story. That being said, this story is boring. Maybe it has to do with the fact that Michael is boring. This story is very difficult to get through. Normally I can't put her stories down, this one I had to consciously think about what story I was reading whenever I did put it down."
2,To Analytical,"I am a big fan of Stephanie Laurens, but this book really dissappointed me. Every scene was analyzed and re-analyze until I wanted to scream. What happend to all your witty conversations with a touch of humor. I realize each book should be different, but perhaps this book could have been a few pages shorter if Stephanie had taken out the ""All that I am, All that she is, All that I need to be"" converstions by the characters to themselves."
2,Just too long,"Michael Anstruther-Wetherby is a rising member of Parliament. But to get ahead he is going to need to get a wife He soon set his sites on the niece of Caroline Sutcliffe,the merry widow. After a while Michael realizes that he want Caro, but there is one of many problems, Caro does not want to remarry.""The Ideal Bride"" by Stephanie Laurens was just way to long and seem to be a repeat of the same storyline. I have to say that it was a very hard struggle to finish this book and the only reason that I did is because I invested so much time into it. It seems after reading a few Stephanie Laurens books back to back that Ms. Laurens needs to come up with some new plot lines, because the old ones are getting boring."
5,The Ideal Bride,I recommended to anyone who hasn't read Stephanie Laurens work. She is a great author and you won't be disappointed.
3,A nice book of old English times.,"I liked the book as I like many of Stephanie Laurens books, but I have noticed over the years that they are getting too heavy with sex and not much of a plot. I liked her books with more intrigue and adventure. I hope this helps."
1,Same old story,"Just another rehash of every other book she's written. One wants to get married, the other doesn't but is quite happy to make lurve at the drop of a hat in the most unusual places. Few unlikely murder attempts thrown in just to vary things a bit. Happy ending."
1,Not What I'm looking for,"I'm on chapter eight of the book so far. I have to admit that I might be writing the review to soon. The book could be awesome after the first eight chapters, but it would still only get one star. No book should take eight long chapters before it gets interesting. Thats just torture. I don't care about the poilitics that surround the book. The characters are boring. You know that the main character is in danger but those moments are to short and fleeting for you to get much out of them anyway. There are no emotions in the book. It's dull. It's sooo dull that I can't keep my mind focused on the page for more then a couple seconds at a time.I'm going to finish this book because I forse myself to finish all the books that I start reading.I figure I should have this book done by the year 2010."
4,Enjoyed it!,"This is my first Stephanie Laurens book, and I'm planning to check out the other books in the Cynster series. I love interconnected books about families, and it looks like she has written several of these. I tend toward books with a lot of sexual tension and interesting sex. This book isn't as graphic as some books so I wouldn't call it an erotic romance or even a sexy romance. It's more about story--a story I enjoyed."
3,VOICE,"season 2 was very good but the voice actor bad it nothing like season 1 funamationthinks every release should have the same voice actor like one piece which the voices is bad dont they get it not every voice match show like shana, one piece. or even oh my goddes had great voice to start with and you change that with voice you heard over and over dvd to dvd it just take away what shana was. the girl the play shana sound the same as the girl the play in the sacred blacksmith just thesame it nothing like the first shana.like onepiece they did a bad job with it."
5,shakugan no shana EX,i cant wait until it comes out but i wonder why its so much right now well i know is very popular so why put it for so much
5,Interesting and helpful,This book give you real tools to work out marital problems. It isn't sugar coated at all. It made me think and taught me a lot about my relationship. I recommend it.Writer at BellaOnline
1,Not worth more than 9 USD,"This book gives some basic information, but 75% of the text refers to the PMBOK, which you also have to buy to read it. It gives a few tips...like you may have problems with your scope because there is a multiple ownership...All in all there are about 30 pages of information, so, in my opinion it is worth about 6 USD. If you are a public project manager it brings you no insite into how to do your job better."
5,Great blocks and great price!,These are decent quality and the price is great! I love that is comes with a little bag and the quantity of blocks in this set. My little 2 yr old loves to tear down towers (especially the ones I build!) and stack them himself. He also decided using his summer sand shovel to pick them up is great fun! :)
3,Melissa&Doug Wooden Blocks,For the price I paid they are fine but I did get them on sale alittle small but cute pics on them I think the grandkids will play with them and have some fun!
5,Blocks Every Child Should Own,Our two year old grandson took these out of the package and immediately started playing with them. He now builds with them and is learning his numbers and the alphabet with them. Great item!
3,OUCH!!!,"These blocks are, by far, the most painful toy I've ever stepped on. I actually gave the blocks away because of this issue. Since my daughter didn't play with them very much anyway (she just threw them out of the toy box onto the floor) I was guilt-free about my choice."
2,"too small, fragile, and not made in America","I bought this name brand of blocks under the assumption that all Melissa and Doug toys are made in America. And wrong I was. The blocks are tiny, cheaply made (in China!) and my almost 2 year old loses interest in them as soon as he dumps them out. He chewed on one for a mere 3 seconds or less and already paint and pieces of wood were in his mouth. Luckily he brought me the pieces to throw away and didn't swallow them!These blocks are good for one thing though - painful weapons for anyone robbing your house in bare feet! Stepping on them in the dark while going for a drink of water - OUCH!"
3,Paint comes off,"Its very retro and a cute idea, however, after I washed it the first time, the paint started coming off of the cubes. I'm concerned about giving it to my daughter because I don't want her ingesting any of the paint into her mouth."
5,Great Value,"I bought these for my then 22 month old daughter for Christmas. She loves them! Ours came with a white cloth bag to store them in (don't know if this one does or not, for sure) and she loves to carry that bag around with her everywhere! Great product from Melissa and Doug!"
4,Classic Blocks At A Great Price,"These are your usual classic wood ABC/123 blocks. They are made just like the ones we had when we were kids. My son loves spelling words with them and just stacking them. He loses his ABC blocks a lot or forgets to put a few away and the dogs love to chew on these.lol The local stores have not been selling these lately and he was wanting some more. I found these on Amazon when I was on the site to purchase a few other items. I noticed that they have the best price I have seen on this amount of blocks. Wal-Mart (when they actually have them) sells a similar set for twice the price of these. If you are looking for this toy, just go ahead and buy these. They are the best price I have found."
2,Not what I expected,"Know what you are buying. I expected these to be 2-inch blocks, but they are 1-inch square. Too small for my taste. I didn't pay attention because I didn't know they made them this small. I am sending them back and getting the big blocks."
2,Not worth the total price including shipping,You might find the same product locally in some stores for the same price so the shipping and handling is an over head .
3,Stay away if ur kid is used to throwing stuff,I selected this one after reading the reviews here. Liked it very much till my son threw it on me and gave me a bump in my forehead. The blocks' corners are very sharp and it cut my forehead. Otherwise it is very nice.
2,Not for my child,"I never would have purchased this product had I actually seen the 1-inch sizing on the description before making the purchase! Why would anyone make a classic and advertise it as ""deluxe"" for it to only be the tiniest little wooden blocks that can't be anywhere near a child because of the choking hazard?! These are for crafting or something other than for child's play!"
2,Soft wood blocks,"Granted, our son is on the younger side and can be rough with toys, but the wood these blocks are made of is too soft. Any slight bang or throw and the blocks either chipped or dented. There were a couple times we found the wood splintered off and finally decided not to use these blocks again."
3,Fun but not the size I expected,Bought these for my toddler and was expecting blocks that were quite bigger that these. They are about an inch wide on each side and my son can easily fit them in his mouth which scares me that he'll choke. Very educational and durable but way too small.
4,Good block set!,"I was looking for some Alphabet blocks to make children's menorahs for Hanukkah. These are just the right size. The only complaint I have, which is particular to my project, is that each letter has the same color in the colored letters. For example, all of the ""A""s are red and all of the ""B""s are green. So if you are making a name out of the blocks, you are stuck with whatever color combination you are stuck with. This may be universal...I don't know."
2,Too Small!,"I didn't end up buying this toy online because I wanted to see them in person. I went to the toy store and found that they are so super small! My nearly 2 year old could probably fit it in her mouth if she wanted to. These blocks look very nice, but I can't see how a toddler could get much enjoyment trying to stack them. I'd recommend getting blocks that are at least 1 3/4"" big instead of 1"". Here is a link for such a product: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E44QAW"
2,smaller than imagined,"These blocks are VERY tiny when you actually see them in person. I'd say about 1/2"" squares. We were also disappointed, we were using them to write the name of the baby for maternity photos, and the colors were not very varied. Over two thirds of the ltters in baby's name were the same color. I am disappointed in these blocks and would not recommend them to a friend"
1,"Garbage! Good brand name, awful product!","I bought these for my twins when they were around 2. Right out of the package I noticed the cheap quality of them. The paint was chipped off in several spots, and the wood was slivered off in the corners on multiple blocks. I immediately put them back in the clear box they came in, and ended up throwing them away. I never even showed them to my kids because they were complete garbage! Don't waste your money on them. I thought Melissa and Doug was a great brand name, and that's why I ordered them. But I do not recommend them at all. Wood and paint are cheap!"
3,SMALL. Does NOT have LOWER CASE letters..,"We bought these for our 18 month old son, who already knows his CAPITAL alphabet. We bought this set specifically for the lower-case letters,which we saw in the pictures of this product. Woops. I guess the pictures are a comparison between the ""mommy and me"" set with bigger blocks and this set. These are small (maybe 1"" x 1""). Skip these and get the bigger, higher quality ""mommy and me"" blocks that have capital letters on one side and lower case letters on the opposite side of the same block."
2,Size of blocks,The size of blocks are small enough to fit in a kids mouth I would consider size a safety issue. Other wise it's a good educational toy.
2,Didn't meet my expectation.,"My little brothers love Barney and saw these kind of blocks on the show So I decided to order this product but when it came in the mail, it was really small. Didn't like it very much."
2,Too small,Afraid my kid will choke with a squere. Just not what I spected for my baby boy of a year and a half.
3,Nice blocks but way too small,"I just received the blocks and although they are nice they are very,very small- only about 1 inch square. I can't believe how tiny they are!!! I didn't even know they made blocks that small, lol."
2,Oldie but not a Goodie!!!,"I got these blocks quite a while ago, proud of myself for finding these ""good old blocks"". They SUCK!! The paint was peeling off the first time it got a little saliva on it! The wood itself is very soft and easily destroyed and splintery!! Stay away from the Old Fashion Type Blocks!!!!!"
2,Disappointing,"These blocks are definitely NOT the classic blocks I had expected. ""Deluxe"" is not a word I would use to characterize them. They are quite small and the quality is not as good as I had expected."
1,Small and Low Quality,"Nothing ""Deluxe"" here - these are low-quality, tiny poorly finished blocks made in China (like all of Melissa & Doug's products, apparently). The paint came off quickly, but it is really the tiny size that is most disappointing. I wondered why the price was so cheap; I guess I understand now!"
3,Blocks too small,"I know these blocks are for over 2yr old babies, however, I have seen my 9mths old playing with some wood blocks that are big and loved it. These are way to small for him, so I will wait until he is old enough to enjoy them better."
3,"Small, sharp blocks.","These blocks are nice quality, seem durable and I like the storage bag. I was disappointed however at the size of these blocks. The edges are also very sharp. I can't leave them out for my twins to play with for fear if they fall they will land on one and injure themselves."
3,..,"Love these blocks but I don't think it's safe for kids younger than a year old or even older! They are so small that a baby can jus put it in her mouth and suck the ink right off since the blocks are so soft when wet. I can't believe they are this small though! I've never seen blocks this small. But on a good note, they are good for creativity, motor skills, learning animals and counting. My 3 year old cousin and my 6 year old niece love it."
1,Sharp edges -- Ouch!,"These are small chunks of wood with sharp corners. I'm surprised they couldn't have been sanded down even a little, as they are, they hurt little feet and if she sits on them she obviously is uncomfortable. They just don't feel good in your hands at all, you don't want to close your hands around them as one might think you'd do with wood. The inked images on the sides are poorly done with some heavy, dark, and bleeding outside the lines and others very very lightly stamped. The carved sides aren't all painted evenly and some are off center giving them a really cheap look. Wanted my babe to have wooden blocks and I thought these were a no-brainer...turns out I was right.(If these were made in China I'd rather they kept them there and used them as an example of what NOT to manufacture. We won't be keeping. I'll buy from someone else.)"
2,smaller than I was expecting,"I got this cheaper than anywhere (including shipping),cheaper than at Target near my home, so I decided to order.But the cubes were way smaller than I was expecting andI did not like the chemical smell. Some may say, nice wood smell,but it was not a wood smell to me."
1,Not appropriate for infants,"I admit my mistake in not noticing the '24 months to 5 years' recommendation. That being said, these blocks are ridiculously small (about an inch square). My 7 month old twins instantly began putting them in their mouths. One baby was almost able to wedge one of the block in his mouth, so I took them away and packed them in the closet. That being said, I think the blocks will be too small for their larger hands once they turn 2 years of age."
4,Good,My son liks to eat the product and my husband keeps stepping on them. Not sure how long they will last.
5,it was tiny,I bought this for my son and he loved it although I didnt know they were super smal other than that it was good kept the kids occupied.
2,Disappointed,"I'm very disappointed in these blocks. I knew they were going to be small from other reviews but there was not a single colored ""y"" in the entire set. Since I need these for newborn pictures and our baby may have a ""y"" in his/her name I will be returning them for a different brand."
1,The night before x mad,I found this book not user friendly for some reason not operated use it made it hard to record it over rode it self very frustrating of course it was made on the USA I would not use again I felt a poor product after about ten times I was able to get it to work customer service was useless michael Bookman mfbookman@msn.com
1,Quality Toy,"Good deal, came in quickly before the holidays for my two year old. Went to walmart the same night, found them MORE expensive at walmart. I'm a happy mom now."
1,Toxic,"I bought these blocks for my child. She licked them and the colors came off. I think they should develop a saliva-proof coloring for their blocks. Also, the licking caused my child to be mocked in kindergarden due to the strange colors of her tongue. This tramatic experience has left her and our family scarred for life. I hate blocks. I'll buy more tomorrow. Good bye."
2,Ehh so-so,"These are not the blocks you grew up with as a kid. They are much smaller, cheaper and don't have paint around the entire blocks. Our child will learn from them, and that's the most important thing, but the product leaves much to be desired."
2,a 'little' disappointed,"I got these for my daughter a while back. I bought them on the internet and wasn't really sure what I was getting. I wasn't able to find blocks at the stores I went to, and was taking a chance. In my opinion they are not great for little ones who are just starting out with building things. They are way too small and require too much hand control to build anything. On the plus side they have held up through my daughter and now my son is using them. In the end I would totally recommend going with a larger block if you are looking for a first block set for your child."
4,good for learing abc/123,"the third of 3 block sets i bought. these ones are really cute because they have a picture on every side of every block. i dont like how all the blocks have the same picture as the corresponding block. for example, the 'A' blocks are only red with a green 'N' on the other side, a dog and an apple on the other sides, and a plain 'j' and '1' on the others. i wish they changed them up so there was more variety. but they are really cute and came with a pouch to put them away in"
4,good product and good service,I purchased this pan to replace one that was so warped that the cake was dripping through. This one bakes well and is sturdy. It washes nicely and looks new even after use.The delivery time was sooner than expected.
1,??,"What exactly is being sold, here ? A cowbell or a practice pad ? Or both ?I would be afraid to order this, and not know what to expect in the mail."
1,"Terrible, terrible ""Book""","I can't believe I wasted money on this piece of trash. I found out afterwards that it was written by a kid. Complete garbage. I'd sell mine used, but I don't want to subject anybody else to reading it."
5,I loved it,I love any matches with the 6 people Hogan Piper Nash Giant Macho Bret Hart I think you should get this great video
2,A real review for Havoc 96,"Alright, this is an event that starts out really well but then ventures it's way down to ...-ville. The top three matches were Mysterio vs. Malenko, which was an action-packed, high energy affair with innovative moves and great submissions from Malenko. Next is DDP vs. Eddie Guerrero, which was an entertaining match, even though the finish was quite anti-climatic. The third best match of the night Syxx vs. Jericho, which was watchable, but you can tell that they are still somewhat inexperinced, and they later put on much better matches. The rest of the event was pretty poor, and I was disappointed because on the back of the box it advertises a Liger vs. Ultimo Dragon match, which is nowhere to be found. The main event is god awful, with so much stalling that you can fast forward through the first several minutes and not miss a second of the action. Do not get this event, as there are much better tapes you can get from 96 WCW."
5,great four any age,"I have a twenty-two month old and a six month old.They both smile, bounce and dance when I put this c.d. on. The tunes are pleasent and fun. The older child sings some of the words during the call and reponse. I like it and the children seem to love it."
3,A bit subpar,"This book lacks the wit and poignancy of the Blackford Oakes novels, and the ending is rather abrupt and ambiguous (perhaps due to Buckley's unwillingness to cast firm judgment on enigmatic historical figures, even though he clearly considers this a work of fiction.) It's a fascinating subject and a compelling read, but it's not Buckley's best."
1,Buckley Owes Us Better,"Buckley's prose seems dictated, with minimal editing. His characters are mostly uninteresting and undeveloped, and the plot and story line are flimsy at best. Thank goodness I read a library copy; I'd have felt scammed if I paid hard-earned cash for this one. Come on, Buckley; it takes more than the profit motive to justify publishing novels."
4,Manna for CIA Junkies,"...of which I am one. Angleton is a fascinating character and I'm certain that there is little difference between this fictional Angleton and the real one. This book is surprisingly compelling -- not gripping like so many spy novels -- but compelling in a more cerebral fashion, as one might expect from a Buckley book. Like other reviewers have noted, there are better books about Angleton, especially Littell's ""The Company"" (also fictional), but this volume is no slouch. It gives us more than a peek at what goes on behind the glass, masonry and mirrors, of the CIA. I thought the characters were particularly well-developed, especially that of Angleton. All in all, a good read."
2,Tedious and horrifying,"Of my three comments, only one really needs expressed: every time I get to racy 'blue' passage in the book, the jacket-picture of Buckley pops into my mind, and I involuntarily gag. ""pressed her malleable vulva"" ! grossssssssssss imagine him saying that line while on his old PBS political talk show.yuck.The other two comments? The plot is an unexeceptional spy-thriller-style and he lays in some bizarrely-constructed sentences that literally make you pause and say, ""huh? Why did he do that?""pass on this; especially at hardcover prices."
4,In Search of the Infamous Fifth Man,"SPYTIME is a fictional story which covers such historical events as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the assassination of Mussolini and the capture of Che Guevara in Bolivia. Many of the book's characters are real. In spite of its title the novel is not a spy story in the traditional sense but is actually written more in the style of an expose of the inner workings of the CIA.Jim Angleton remains in the background throughout much of the story while the bulk of the spy action is handled by his young protege, Tony Crespi, who is stationed in Beirut. Angleton's main obsession as Director of Counterintelligence is the search for the infamous Fifth Man who collaborated with Burgess, Maclean, Blunt and Philby.SPYTIME is an intriguing book for anyone who is interested in the Cold War and the CIA. Buckley writes with some authority about these subjects. The novel's greatest weakness is its lack of suspense and the ending is also a bit of a dud."
3,Buckley can do better,"Buckley is a major American writer, and his fiction is better than many give him credit for. However, I think he's overreached in ""Spytime,"" which is an ungainly mix of history, an implausible spy potboiler, and a stab at identifying the legendary ""fifth man"" in Philby's circle.The book feels as if Buckley just wants to write a silly spy novel. He could write a good one if he didn't force himself to include such an endless parade of historical characters, whose actions have to be at least plausibly reconciled with the facts. Countless heads of state, spymasters, and spies march across these pages without adding much to the leading characters or the plot.At the end, Buckley makes an intriguing stab at the fifth man. I think he's been nursing this theory for a while and wrote the book in order to publicize it. I wish he had just told us flat out, and then written the novel he wanted to write."
3,There's a Better Read,"In my opinion, Robert Littell's: The Company: A Novel of the CIA is the definitive fictional account of James Jesus Angleton.It captures the EXTREME nuances of Counter-Intelligence."
3,Not as good as his usual,"As a fan of WFB's fiction, a lover of LeCarre novels, and a true spy follower, I found this novel a disappointment. Details were missing, and lectures on the dangers of communism were all too present. Story line wasn't a page turner, though the true story is. And the language of this book wasn't amusing and flowing and compelling, which you expect with this author. One thing jarred me...why did Buckley find it necessary to name a major character Hugo Esterhazy? I couldn't decide if it was a complicated pun on the Dreyfus affair and Zola, or an homage to LeCarre's character Toby Esterhase in ""Tinker Tailor""? Who incidently was a much better written character. Better to go back and reread the Blackford Oakes books."
2,Buckley Can Do Better,"I am looking forward to reading the Mangold biography. As fiction Buckley's work is below par. I had expected more from him, the scholar that he is. This book pretends to clear Angleton,when it doesn't present enough factual detail to do this. Then it ends on a surprise note, accusing his superior without presenting any facts. Fiction can do more than simply tell or dramatize a story. I believe Harlot's Ghost by Norman Mailer, though not complete, does a better job covering some of this same information. Admittedly the latter requires a sequel to finish the job."
5,In Love with Home Theater.,Great cable for the money! Amazon saved me so much money over buying it locally. It does exactly what it is advertised to do.
5,Matching set,"Got these cables to match my system (yes, I am like that) and they work great. They are single link and four feet is shorter than you think."
3,STIFF CORD,"The Monster Cable is a great quality cable. It works great with my computer. As advertised great for the price ($10). This cord does not provide sound from computer to TV.PROS:-STRONG CORD AND GREAT INSULATION FOR PROTECTION FOR THE WIRESCONS:- STIFF, ISNT VERY MANUVERABLE- DOESNT PROVIDE SOUND"
4,Good quality cable. Note though its Is male dvi connection.,"Cable appears of good quality and for a Monster branded product was a good price.Beware though, it was not specified that the dvi connect is a male plug.My bad, had assumed it was (and was after) a female plug to connect my existing dvi cable ending with a male plug.I now have to order a female to female coupler to make the Monster cable work (was easier than returning).Amazon, the dvi connection type (male) would be a key technical detail to update regarding this cable."
4,Monster 4' ultra 600HDMI to DVI,"Cable looks good. Strong but not too flexy.Come with Monster packaging.Picture seem a little better compared to my old cable. This Monster got 4 stars from me. I think Monster cable are alot nicer ,better and for the price paid it worth getting one.Thanks monster and seller. Jaya2."
5,Good cable for under 10 bucks,"This is what you would expect from a good cable, it just works without any issues. Cable looks durable, good looking, easy to attach. The thickness is average for HDMI and DVI cables.I used this cable to connect the second DVI monitor to HDMI output of an AMD graphic card. That worked without problems. The cable is shorter than a typical DVI cable, it's only 4 feet, so measure before buying."
4,Good Puzzle,Got it for our Great Grand son who is 2 1/2 so he is still learning to put it together. Nice big pieces
5,This puzzle is big fun!,"We gave this to my son for his 3rd birthday a month ago. He loves it and puts it together almost every day. It's gotten to the point where he hardly needs any help. The level of difficulty seems perfect for him. The pieces are large, colorful, and sturdy. I feel this is a quality product."
5,A great puzzle.,Melissa and Doug puzzles are generally a good buy with big sturdy pieces and bright colors. This puzzle is no different.The pieces are big enough for little fingers to hold and manipulate. The pieces are durable and have put with with three children putting this puzzle together and pulling it apart repeatedly. The colors are bright.The bright yellow line going down the side of the fire truck is what makes it easy enough for children as young as four (and a little bit younger) able to put it together.This is a great puzzle.Enjoy.
5,Big hit,This was a big hit for my almost 3 year old. It has large pieces and looked great put together under the Christmas tree
3,Would Rather Play With A Real Truck,"My 3 year old son is obsessed with fire trucks, and we got three of these as birthday presents at his fireman-themed birthday party. On the plus side, the pieces are very sturdy and the puzzle makes a nice gift (we've ""re-gifted"" our two extras). On the other hand, unlike other reviews here, I have to say that my son couldn't be less interested in playing with this puzzle. He'd much rather play with his real trucks, or dress up like a fireman and use a jump-rope as a makeshift fire hose. Maybe when he gets a little older it will be of more interest."
4,melissa & doug gaint fire truck floor puzzle,"the fire truck puzzle good, except when I open the box I saw what look like mole on some parts of the puzzle so I had to wipe it off and it came off , where the product was stored may have some moisture in the room. The other two products were fine."
5,WELL MADE FUN for the kids,EXCELLENT COLORS -design and durable! VERY fun for the kids to play with! THEY put it together all the time and laugh and take it apart and put it back together! BIG and BRIGHT! I was VERY IMPRESSED!
5,"My 2 1/2 year old's favorite ""game""","My son's favorite subject is currently firetrucks and he has gravitated toward this puzzle, calling it a ""game"". His attention span and ability in puzzle making have a lot of room to grow. In spite of that, he wants to pull it out daily and attempt it with an adult. The number of pieces are challenging, yet not overwhelming and the big pieces appeal to him as well."
5,Good for toddlers,"It seems difficult at the beginning for a newbie in puzzles, but after 3 tries my 3 year old could complete it on his own and beaming proudly. Worth the buy!"
3,Gnerally a good book on the German Panther Tank,"If I remember correctly, this is the forth book from MBI on WW2 tanks. The previous three are US M4 Sherman, USSR T-34, and the German Tiger I Tanks.This book covers (not in detail) the origins, production, combat history and variants of the panther tanks with some b/w photographs and colour plates. As I have read quite a number of books on the panther tanks, this one can only be ranked in the middle. I will consider this book to be a good introduction for anyone who has little knowledge on the panther tank.More serious WW2 enthusiasts, modelling fans, historians should gear towards books from Thomas Anderson's ""Panther"" (Concord), Thomas L. Jentz's ""Germany's Panther Tank"" (Schiffer), and numerous books from Wydawnictwo ""Militaria"" series from Poland."
5,Skechers Shoes,"These shoes are some of the most comfortable I have ever worn. My daughter told me that her orthopedist said they were very well balanced for back trouble. I have bought three pairs and am glad I did. I stand the whole time I am working and since the shoes fit so close to your foot and the instep snugs right into your instep, I really don't see how you can miss the most comfortable fit of any shoe. There are many different sizes and styles so you can probablly find just the right Skecher for you."
2,Dislikable main character,"I sat down in great anticipation of a good British mystery and instead of reading the book in a single sitting as I usually do, took over a week to finish Funeral Music.I did not like Sara Selkirk, finding her too self-centred, pretentious and snobby for my tastes. A man was murdered and somehow it was all about her. Sara didn't ""investigate"" because she was horrified at the death of the victim, rather she was upset that it interfered with the even tenor of her life.She reacted with distaste at the way George, a security guard treated a homeless woman with a child, yet she was not above the same kind of judgemental actions, albeit higher brow.I certainly would not count someone like her among my friends and I most likely will not read the next in the series."
1,Funeral Music (Sara Selkirk Mysteries),"Boring! What more can I say. I managed to get to the last page of this book and passed it to a friend who is a great fan of Morag Joss' other works (but had never read any of the Sara Selkirk series) and she also had the same reaction - ""boring"". And to think that along with Funeral Music I ordered (based on my love of Joss' other works like Half Broken Things (fantastic) the other 2 books in the Sara Selkirk series. What will I do with them? Sara Selkirk Mysteries? There's no mystery involved. They're selling for less than I paid for them on Amazon. Why? Maybe because they are soooooooo boring."
2,"a little too british, thanks","In Morag Joss' FUNERAL MUSIC, the main character is Sara Selkirk, a famous cellist recuperating in Bath, England after a nervous breakdown in the middle of a concert. After making a small scale return to playing at a charity event, Sara discovers a dead body...the body of a man she never met.The central plot of FUNERAL MUSIC revolves around Sara's emotional recovery...the circumstances of her breakdown are reveealed late, although many readers will probably figure it out early on. Meanwhile, Sara's involvement in the murder case is tangiental, driven by the fact that people tell her things almost constantly.....especially the hunky police offer whose marriage is on the rocks and loves the cello.There almost no suspense in FUNERAL MUSIC, and much of the book is taken up with descriptions of interior design or food preparation......I'm not quite sure where this series can go."
4,fun to do together as a family,"I'm always looking for activities that we can do together. My daughter loves castles and princesses, so she's interested from the start. We talk about how to look for clues as to how the pieces go together. It has big pieces that are easy for small hands to handle. I'm only giving 4 stars because it's not usually her pick. It's our pick, and then she joins in the fun."
3,Not the correct puzzle,"I really can't give a review other than the puzzle is of just a castle, not the castle and princess. I bought it for my 3 year old granddaughter for Christmas. Disappointed the princess isn't in it. Will add to the review after I give it to her for Christmas. They need to fix the image. I gave it a neutral rating until I see how she likes it."
4,Stimulating imagination,I like the idea of it being large and being placed on the floor. A child spends most of his/her time on the floor and a puzzle that appeals to her can stimulate her imagination with each piece.Thanks
5,just esplendid,"Mr Bojangles, just esplendid, a song that reach a mist of peace and pleasure, just listen!Luis Camarinho Portugal"
5,Very cool,"I purchased this for my dedicated home theatre circuit. I can't attest to if it has bettered my picture or sound quality but I do know that we've had some pretty crazy electrical storms recently that have blown out neighbors cable boxes, TV's, computers, etc. I didn't notice anything. It looks cool too when mounted to the wall."
4,Pretty nice product,"My noise floor didn't drop, my picture didn't get cleaner, and no other magic occured when I connected this product. On the other hand, it has nicely spaced outlets to accommodate the invitable wart power supplies and the rear-facing plugs make everything look nice and clean. I'm happy with it, and will probably never spend more on a power strip again.P.S. Emotiva, a manufacturer of high-current amplifiers, advises customers to AVOID power conditioners as they restrict current draw and cause undue stress and heat from their amplifiers, resulting in damage. So yes, all the genius audio and videophiles insisting their systems sounded remarkably better after installing Monster Power or Panamax power conditioners in their systems are damaging their gear. Sleep easy with that knowledge, friends."
2,Great wings! Watch out for the skirt!,"I love the wings I got with this costume. I ended up wearing them with a black shirt and jeans. Beware... the bottom of this costume is just a small flap of orange cloth. There's no real skirt, so you have to be very petite and brave to wear this as shown!"
1,horrible,"I was really looking forward to this movie coming out. Unfortunately probably half the people in the theatre left before it was over, it is actually that bad. Not too gruesome, or too anything, just pitifully bad."
4,A Bad Horror Movie But A Good Thriller!,This is a good work by Rob Zombie. I would however not consider this to be a horror movie. I would consider it more of a thriller as it is not the least bit scary. It is more gorey and uncomfortable at parts then anything else. The acting is excellent and I like the fact that the tables turn on the agressors (The Decils Rejects) and the hunters become the hunted. Good DVD extras are included aswell including some great bloopers.
5,Classic drive in fodder,"The sequel to House Of 1,000 Corpses although more of a chase movie than a horror movie it is still a good exploitation movie that back in the day would've been a drive in staple."
3,Much Better Than I Thought It Would Be!,"When I saw this movie, I automatically thought it would suck because it was a sequel to HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. But, I was in for a pleasant surprise. After I was done wathcing THE DEVIL'S REJECTS I was entertained. I didn't feel like I wasted time watching this movie. I even saw it 3 or 4 times! So, kudos to you Rob Zombie! You improved on HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES by a landslide! THE DEVIL'S REJECTS was way WAY better than the first and WAY WAY WAY better than I thought it would be."
4,The Devils Rejects,It was a good movie and it was different from any other movies I've seen in a long time. Its something that kids should not watch.
1,Are you serious rob? this is it?,"Please this is no where near good. how many texas chainsaw remakes are there going to be? This family tries to be so disturbing but they aren't. Who's the skinny wuss? Are people really scared of this family. Oh wait every character using the f word every sentence makes them scary. In TCM the family was crazy this family only acts crazy. Can a writer please come up with something OG. I guess this movie just tries way too hard to be scary or disturbing.All the characters are annoying. The devil isn't scary so why say, ""I'm the devil and I'm here to do the devils work."" If you miss once try again if you miss twice just give up. I want a refund! Dialogue is weak, the directing is weak Two thumbs down!"
1,Stink Tweekers Menacing The Motel Guests,What a dumb movie. It's like some tweeker party gone mad. Who wants to watch very ugly ugly ugly people having sex? Well I guess there is a market out there but yucko!!!!!
1,??????,"This is the worst film I have ever seen. Rob Zombie should have taken the money he used to make this piece of trash and fed the homeless. Zero plot, zero worth,and I wish I could give it zero stars. I should have taken the four dollars I used to rent this movie and wiped my behind with it."
5,Another great masterpiece...,"Yet again, the zombie king of horror gave birth via brainstorming one of the greatest horror movies ever made. But this isn't only a mere horror film. Its an outlaw western heavily influenced by not only ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" films, but also those incredible and masterfully directed films by cinematic geniuses Tarantino and Martin Scorsese. Not much more to say here other than that ""The Devil's Rejects"" contains some of the greatest performances, dialogue, songs, and direction that I have only encountered in Sergio Leone and Martin Scorsese classics. Although I'm also a huge fan of Rob Zombie's music and have followed throughout his early days of White Zombie, I hope he continues to focus on making great movies rather than making anymore albums."
2,Derivative,"To get writing credit for lifting a story is atrocious. Get the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre's 1 and 2... 1000% better than this. I had to stick through to the end just to be sure the characters were killed so there's no threat of a sequel. On the flip side, to note one or two good points... the actor playing Captain Spalding was quite good. And it was nice to see Diamond Dallas Page, the Hills Have Eyes guy, and the knife guy from Desperados. Oh, the the rooster purchasing scene... that was a great stand-alone 45 seconds. That's the best you're getting here."
1,Horrriiible,"I seen this movie the other night and had to shut it off after the first 35 minutes. I can't see how the hell anyone would enjoy this movie unless they were just completely sick and useless like Rob Zombie himself. I've seen Rob 7 years ago in concert and I thought he put on a very entertaining show, but I,ve lost tremendous respect for him over the years and now I have none for him at all. How can anyone be so obsessed with gore? He really needs to grow up and face reality. I would like to see Rob Zombie's rich ass try to survive out on the mean streets of my city. I assure u that he will than be truly scarred."
2,"Almost as bad as House of 1,000 Corpses","Maybe I was a little harsh, but Rob Zombie is an awesome musician who should probably stick to just that. The Devil's Rejects was ""okay"" and was a bit entertaining...just not the greatest movie in the world I must say. Taking place weeks after the events in House of 1,000 Corpses, this sequel follows the serial-killing Firefly family as its members go on the lam after a bloodbath. They're pursued by Sheriff John Wydell, who's looking to avenge his brother's murder. Not too much of an original plot...rent it or wait for cable."
1,disappointment,This blu-ray will not play in any blu-ray player. I have tried several different players and no luck.
1,Death Valley 69 - Cinema of Transgression,"Remember those R Kern and Nick Zedd films that Film Threat was raving about in the 80s? anyone? no? okay...this film is a continuation of a questionable punk rock performance art film style that was big in the 80s. A corny parody of gender roles, rural stereostypes of masculinity, shocking exploitation films and etc.the trouble with ironic incompetence mixed with parody is that sometimes its worse than the original. maybe im giving zombie too much cred. maybe he had a superficial take on the genre and he truly enjoys this stuff for its own sake. doesnt matter to me. this stuff is drek."
5,best film of 2005`,"simply stated - If you like raw violence, good music then this movie is for you. I saw this movie twice in one week and I never been to a movie where I actually saw people leave during the film- you know some poeple are to weak in the stomach for some films - Last I heard people leaving during a movie was when the original Texas Chainsaw came out. Well, what does that tell you. Me and my husband love this movie"
5,New Trailer,"The new trailer for The Devil's Rejects can be seen before Sin City and it looks even better than the last. The trailer doesn't give away much, but it will get you excited, while still leaving plenty to your imagination."
2,had its brief moments,"but pretty much a wasted venture.i was very impressed,however,with the performance turned in my priscilla barnes.she had to really sully herself to get into charactor(shell need the rest of the year to delouse).the plot is cookie cutter;cops out to catch lunatic family.for a second feature,its not the worst.i would only recommend this if you have a need to hear the f word a quadrillion times accompanied by randumb stabbings."
2,SLASHER BORDERLINE PORNO...,"I love Rob Zombie think he is a genius (musically) on the movie front he tries but fails miserably. These are like Low Budget Taratinoesque wannabes flixs. Besides the violence, the movie is a borderline porno with its racy sex scenes along with its violence. Very predictable movie, no real surprises here...RENT IT if you MUST but I wouldn't recommend buying this movie unless you are a DIEHARD Zombie Nut."
2,not that great,This film was not that great people. although it had some funny moments it was not scary. This was more like a B level midnightmovie you would watch high on pot. I guess I would have appreciated it more if Rob Zombie would have presented it this way. Better luck next time Mr Zombie
2,What a bummer!!!,"This movies was such a disappointment to me. Nothing like the first movie. I was expecting the same type of horror in the new film and it doesnt even compare, even the characters didnt seem the same. I am glad I didnt buy this one!!"
1,TORTURE PORN FOR CRETINS,"The latest in director Zombie's breathtakingly ignorant obsession with aggrandizing the Manson family.The audience is invited to laugh along as the protagonists cutely argue over ice cream - after a full day of butchering innocent bystanders like pigs. The director's perplexing contempt for victims - of everything from rape to impersonal serial murder - is glaringly apparent throughout.Swill for the terminally stupid - further evidence why SAT scores continue to nosedive in America.Enjoy it, morons."
1,Two Thumbs Up?,"Wow! What a terrible movie! It has officially topped the worst movie list for me! I couldn't get into it. No character development, terrible acting, and even the cussing got old! All I got out of this is it might be possible that there are people out there like that... Or even the fact we don't know why they're killing people makes it dumb. You can't have such violent characters without some kind of explanation. Ebert and Roeper must have gotten desperate for thumbs up or something because I would of only given it away to Goodwill.I do like horror movies but at least some of them have points and this was just sick and insane. Is this where the movie industry is going? To the garbage???Maybe Rob Zombie was trying something new. But man! Did this movie SUCK!!!"
1,You have to be very sick to like this movie,"Anyone who can actually come up with the content in this movie is really messed up and anyone who would want to watch it or likes it - is even more messed up. I turned it off half way through because I was so uncomfortable and offended. And I'm not that easily offended. I'm horrified that someone could walk into a video store and rent this. It belongs in the porn section or those scary underground places where people buy snuff films. It's truly sick and demented that anyone could call this a good movie. If necrophiliacs, people who rape women and cut them up are your hero's -then this movie is for you because it glorifies them - and you are a horrible person."
1,Not up to expectations...,"Wow. My wife and I liked Rob's first movie, but this sequel was painful to sit through. We watched the whole thing (even the Thelma and Louise ending) b/c we thought that it just had to get better. It did not. We recommend his first one (excellent camera work) but not this one. Repeatedly, we found ourselves saying, ""That's just disgusting"" and if that's all you are saying, then there is not much of movie."
3,"Good, but not great.","This was a good but not great movie. It isn't near as good as Rob Zombies remake of John Carpenters Halloween. It would be nice if Zombie could also do a remake of all the other Halloweens john screwed up (AKA everyone except for the forth, maybe fith, H2O and maybe the second to last one).Now on to the review. The Devils Rejects is a sequal to the film ""House of A Thousand Corpses"". In this film the bad guys from ""House of A Thousand Corpses"" are on the run from the law in the desert. This movie was allot simular to ""House of A Thousand Corpses"". Good costumes, and very beleivable, but it could have used a few more killing scenes. All though it did have a bit more killing in it then ""House Of A Thousand Corpses"". This movie gets 1/2 a star more then ""House of A Thousand Corpses"", because it had a bit more killing in it and an extreemly good sick and twisted ending."
4,NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH OR COMPLAINERS,"I am not a sociopath or tasteless person, and I enjoyed this film. It is a gory, disturbing, violent film with actors who play off as caricatures of real people because it is this approach that gives the film its cheesy, sensational feeling. Rob Zombie is a b-movie junkie, and""The Devils Rejects"" is a great salute to the splatter films of yesteryear. It has a low budget feel, yet is beautifully shot. It's like a b-movie without all the graininess, so it feels more explicit. I only have one contrary thing to say about the film. I don't think the nudity in this film was necessary. Though not offended by it this facet would be the only thing that detracted from the intensity of the film. The nude stuff was gratuitous and just there for sensationalism."
4,Meh,"Definitely very mediocre quality for blu-ray. I was expecting much more on a blu-ray from such an awesome movie!!!! But for as cheap as it was, I do not regret it!"
4,Well-made Bloody Gore Fest!,"The Devil's Reject is surprisingly entertaining and captivating horror rollercoaster ride experience. It has loads of blood and gore and the characters are pretty nasty. The Sheriff character is well depicted and played by William Forstyn. He's kind a combination of good and bad, the role could've been played by Tommy Lee Jones. The Firefly family members include the clown father, the son, the daughter, and the dirty mouthed captured mother are very disturbing and intense characters. Watching them in this movie reminded me of characters played by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis in Natural Born Killers. I actually enjoyed this film more than other similar films such as Saw and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The special feature's production documentary is also worth checking out."
4,"Even creepier than ""House of 1000 Corpses""","And in my opinion, I think it's even better than 1000 Corpses. 1000 Corpses has a Texas Chainsaw-feel to it. The Devil's Rejects has that nostalgic-feel of low budget 70's horror films. Creepy and chilling, it's more shocking than scary in the sense you won't be checking your closet for Captain Spalding once you're done watching, though if you've never feared clowns before, you probably will after you see this. It's disturbing and will satiate your cravings for horror. I wouldn't recommend watching it alone, but if you like this genre, especially if you can appreciate the older movies from this genre, I definitely recommend The Devil's Rejects. If you saw 1000 Corpses, you shouldn't miss this one from Rob Zombie. I think it's even better than 1000 Corpses."
3,Hard-core horror fans stop reading here.,"This review is for more mainstream viewers attracted by the ""two thumbs up"" on the cd box. This film probably isn't for you. As many reviewers have eloquently explained, this film attempts to evoke the low-budget, shock and gore-fests of the seventies. It does that well.But if you're not already steeped in that, or if you don't think the death, torture, cruelty, murder, zombie, serial killer imagery of death metal is compelling, and you're not obsessed with Ed Gein, you can probably pass on this. There's really no point to it and you'll have to endure some nasty torture and degradation scenes among menaced hostages.However, if this is your bag, by all means check this out. It is what it is."
5,Makes House of 1000 Corpses look like Finding Nemo!,"Well, reprising my role as Otis Driftwood makes me a little biased in favor of Rob Zombie's ""House of 1000 Corpses"" sequel, so tough bananas. I was just over in Amazon DVDs buying a friend of mine some Miike movies (Ichi, Visitor Q, Dead or Alive, etc) and I typed in the Devil's Rejects on a whim (or was it a lark?!). It kicks ass; we all got bloody doing the movie. Rob took me to a very dark place in this one, but as he says, ""Art is not safe."" Now I know dark- I was Chop-top in Texas Chainsaw 2, Johnny in the Savini remake of Night of the Living Dead- and come July 22, '05, when The Devil's Rejects hits the Big Screen, you'll know dark, too."
2,kind of boring,"I was really excited to see this movie b/c I have heard so many people say it was so scary. I was really disappointed. I was actually bored in this movie. I think I just expected it to be great so I was very surprised that it wasn't.I love movies like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and stuff like that, but I really didn't care for this movie."
4,"Good, but not as good as the first.","The blood and gore is still there from the first movie, House.... so is the sick, creepy, mood. Its just a little too disjointed at parts.Just curious. How many people figured out the ending was only a dream? Just like Captain Spaldings previous dream (about the girl) earlier in the film."
3,"""NOT TO BE SEEN WITH YOUR CHILDREN""","I saw part of this movie on cable and I couldn't believe how graphic the violence was. Equally violent was the graphic language. This is definitely NOT ""The Dukes Of Hazzard"",folks! Keep this movie ""out of the reach of children"" under lock and key."
5,A Homage to all the Great '70's movies,"Rob Zombie has paid tribute to all the drive-in movies we loved in the '70's. Ther are scenes that seem lifted straight from ""Taxi Driver"", ""Last House on the Left"",, ""The Wild Bunch"", ""Easy Rider"", etc. But it's not stealing, it's honoring.The film also shows elements of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" because it blurs the line between monster and hero. You leave the film with a grudging respect for these awful people because of the brutality showed to them by the sheriff.The Southern rock sound track fits perfectly (expecially ""Free Bird""The violence is unrelenting, but it keeps you glued to the screen! This film is a horror classic!"
2,"It just stopped ..... before the end, a little over half way thur....this is the second movie we've gotten from ya'll.",The movie was fine until a little over half way though it just stopped. Would not move back or forward. This is the second time we have had friends over and this happen with your movies. not real good advertisment....so they said. And so do I. It may be a long time before we think of ordering from you again !!!!!!
4,"NOT BAD ,JUST WATCH IT IT AND ENJOY","THIS IS A FUN MOVIE, NOT FOR THE KIDS, JUST SOMETHING TO CHILL OUT TO AND ENJOY THE HORROR. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A CLASSIC HORROR FILM, LOOK ELSEWHERE, BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD TIME, WATCH IT, OR BUY IT."
4,Not a reject,"I liked Devil's Rejects better than House of 1000 Corpses. The characters are better developed in this sequel. I hope Rob keeps making movies like these two, House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects."
4,BETTER THAN THE FIRST!! A BUNCH OF PSYCHOS!!,"this movie was a trip, a bunch of crazy, no good killers, who fortunatley get theres in the end. rob zombie, like they say practice makes perfect. better the second time around. if you don't like the sadistic crazy maniac killers who don't give a crap, well this isn't for you. cause these guys and girl are just to freakin evil, no remorse, no mercy. they make everyone pay, in the worst way possible. in general the whole storyline and craziness, i liked it and i give it a thumbs up."
3,I watched in horror...which i guess is good cuz thats the genre...,"Well...cinematically, this was a pretty interesting movie. The storyline was so sick and twisted that only Rob Zombie could come up with it. I seriously came really close to vomiting. The only time a movie has brought me to yak was Snakes on a Plane--and that was because i had tonsil surgery and was on all these meds. I definately watched in horror, and I threw this one into the ""sell"" pile because I don't think I can sit through it again.I thought House of 1000 corpses was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and had I not already purchased this one before seeing that one I would not have ever watched this, however this one is much ""Better"" than its prequel."
5,One of the best Horror films of this era,I loved this film. And it's even better in Blue Ray. The sound quality is wonderful and the you feel like you're in the room with Zombie's rejects. This movie is more fun that any of the horror flicks I've seen and you owe it to yourself to see it in High Def.
2,I preferred House of 1000 Corpses,The devils rejects didn't seem like a sequel to 1000 Corpses. I prefer House it gave you the fear of small towns. Sick and twisted in various ways. The Devils rejects although I bought the dvd to give it another chance it doesn't keep you 100% entertained like the first one. Well each person has there own opinion.
5,Definately Worth It to Buy It,"Rob Zombie has proved himself to be a great director with the Firefly Family series. He already proved himself as a musician but these movies are the real reason why I respect him. This movie has a unique set of characters, great plot, and plenty of action. This movie is truly grotesque and even feels like a Horror Western. My only complaint with this movie is that Rob has in all his movies sex-crazed hillbillies, however they are even well done in this movie."
4,killer killer good time,this is good old fun horror action cult film making... rob zombie has a great eye for cinema.. buy it now!!!!
3,Devil's Rejects on Blu-Ray? Seems standard to me,"Devil's Rejects is amongst my favorite films, for it's great mix of humor, action/violence/gore, and character development. Most people looking at this review already know all about this movie.The Picture on this movie doesn't seem to be all that much of an improvement. I've seen VAST differences on Blu-Rays vs DVD (Unforgiven especially!!!), and this movie just doesn't seem to have all that much extra when watching it in Hi-Def.There are no new special features in this release, so if you already own this title on DVD, I would advise against upgrading like I did."
1,Embarrassed to admit that I watched the whole thing,"Settled down on the couch in front of the TV one evening after a exhausting day at work, intent on putting my mind on hold by perhaps watching an entertaining movie. As is frequently true, however, the program guide was full of already watched and boring fare except that this film was being presented uncut on IFC with a rather benign teaser caption. Notwithstanding that a few scenes were actually a little humorous, this was one of the most improbable and sadistic pieces of crap that I've ever watched. I kept waiting for something worthwhile, and it never happened. At the end, I felt like taking a shower to wash off the stink. If this is your idea of engrossing entertainment or social allegory, you must be kidding. Get a life (and get some help while you're at it)."
2,still the same,"I've tried this one because i wanted to check Rob Zombie behind the camera instead of behind the mic. It's ok but not unforgettable . Actually , you don't mind watching it but you forget it within 10 minutes after"
2,Very shoddy sequel!,"The original House of 1000 Corpses was great because it was a celebration of Zombie's love for the horror genre. It also included such great camerawork and surrealistic colors and humor.This film was just a straight killer flick. Nothing fun or original from the 1st film was included.Karen Black? Gone. Replaced by an actress (most famous for the Police Academy films) who couldn't capture 1/5th of Black's mania or comedy.No mentions of Grandpa Firefly, Dr. Satan or The Professor.What a disappointment."
1,HORRIBLE,Possilby the worst horror flick I've seen all year. Don't waste your time. Watch Polar Express instead.
1,don't waste your time and money,"i've never seen a movie more deranged than this one. not only was there pervasive F-words (which got quite annoying), but the violence and nudity was just too much. i feel like they found as much crap as they could and packed it into a two hour movie.i've seen my share of horror movies.. but i guess i must be more into the psychological thriller than the ""torture and brutally kill people for fun"" movies.ugh. horrible. F."
1,The Devil's Rejects,This is definitely not a movie children should see or hear. I was astounded by the course language and attitudes. I don't recommend this for anyone who objects to four letter words or profanity!
4,Seems to get better the more I watch it!,"When I saw it in the movie theater. I was like, that's it? I mean i enjoyed it, but wasen't quit what I thought it would be. Then when it came out on dvd. I went out and bought it. For some reasone, it just gets better the more I watch it. So, it's great! I must not remember the movie to well. I got the unrated version. Usually that means, theirs more in it. Then what you saw in the theater. But, I can't tell what's different. This movie is not a horror movie. It's more of a violent comedy. Because you laugh more than you do anything else. Good movie! I liked House of 1000 corpses, better."
4,Great Horror Movie For The Ages!!!!,This movie was a great horror movie.This was so much better than House of 1000 Corpses.This sequal is about the Firefly family running away from the cops to stay alive.The biggest problem is that there is the sheriff that wants revenge for his brothers death.The movie was give you the chills.There is some very disturbing parts.P.J Soles also made a special appearence in this horror movie.That even made this movie even better!This movie is full of classic rock songs from beginning to end.So if you are a fan of classic rock or horror movie this is the perfect movie for you.The acting was descent.Captain Spaulding was hilarious once again.BABY was the greatest.Otis is the creepy one.So if you took Rob Zombie's directing as a joke..Thing Again!
1,Repulsive movie,"This is truly the worst movie I have ever tried to watch. The movie is a composite of vile scenes that fail to create a scary, intriguing or even an interesting story. It is simply a movie filled with as much gore as Rob Zombie could throw together. I will be looking to dump this movie as soon as possible."
1,unbelievably bad,"i kind of liked 'house of a 1000 corpses'. it started off promising then rapidly fell into full on cra%tasticness. this one doesn't even attempt to be good. i love horror flicks but this one was like a sorrier version of natural born killers. in a few lines i will never be able to express how pitifully bad and disappointing this movie was. the only positive is that rob zombie's wife who stars in the movie is really hot. other than that, the entire 'movie' is a great waste of time and money.avoid"
2,Why is this called a horror film?,"I've noticed that most people are claiming this is a horror movie. I just don't see it. Is it sort of sick and twisted, yes. But scary, no way, unless you are 10 years old... Most of the film is boring and forgettable. I even found the characters to be uninteresting. Its nothing that I havent seen before. Nothing new or innovative or cringe-worthy. No awesome payoff at the end. Just a waste of time really."
5,MASTERPIECE!!!!!,"All i can say is WOW! This movie is so great, definitly a horror fans wet dream. If you are sick and tired of the modern day ""hip hop generation"" horror slop, this movie is for you! Very gritty, very sick and twisted, very poetic ending. Buy this movie it is one to own for sure!!!!"
3,Better than the first,"Devil's is a better movie than the first. It's not as horror as House of 1000 Corpses, instead its more of Natural Born Killers. There's more of a plot and less disturbing imagery. I guess revenge isnt that disturbing."
5,its got to be awesome,the first film(house of 1000 corpses) it wasnt the greatest flick ever but yet it was unlike anything ever made.its a copy off of the original texas chainsaw massacre a little bit but its still crazier and the original tcm hasnt got much to offer. and the devils rejects i herd is probally going to have the highest profit that lions gate shall ebver have.
5,Great Group,"I haven't listened to this CD yet, but I am sure it meets their usual Quality. I love Mannheim Steamroller"
1,A Disco Christmas - ACK!,"I LOVE Christmas. I love the festive atmosphere. I love the spirit of giving and I love Christmas music.This stuff, however, is downright painful to listen to. A few tracks, with the slower tempo, can be tolerated in small doses, but the more ""upbeat"" number are too awash in synthesizer arrangements and come across as little more than ""a disco Christmas"" and severely test my love for the music of the season. Destined for shopping mall PA systems everywhere."
1,Mannheim Steamroller,"I was really, really disappointed with this CD. I was looking for a Christmas CD for my car for over the holidays to put us in a Christmas Spirit, and I would not recommend this one.....too boring I thought."
3,Easy Listening,"Not bad. Usual Mannheim Steamrolleer music. If you are a Manheim Steamroller fan as I am, you can't go wrong."
1,Deceptive Marketing?,"I'm glad to see I wasn't the only person duped into buying this under the impression that it's new music from Mannheim Steamroller. Is the music good? Yes. But you already have it all if you've bought their previous Christmas CDs. The front cover should have plainly stated that this is a compilation from previous releases. Only when I pulled out the enclosed booklet did I find that admission. I suppose I should have drawn the connection from the title listing on the back, but I simply assumed this would be a new set of arrangements. Buyer beware."
1,Disappointment,"This album is mostly re-releases of material on previous Steamroller Christmas albums. I own all of the earlier discs and certainly did not need additional cuts of that material. This piece should have been promoted as a ""best of"" album, since that is what it is. Save your money."
1,Disappointed,I have purchased all of the previous Mannheim Steamroller Christmas CD's and anxiously awaited this one. When I received it as a Christmas gift I immediately played it. What a disappointment to find that only 4 of the 18 songs were ones that were not on the other CD's! This definitely will be my last Mannheim Steamroller CD.
2,Another Example of Recycling!,"The only good thing about this CD is that I found it, a week before Christmas, at a Sam's Club (read: cheap) when I was travelling and in need of something for the rental car CD player. I couldn't stand the first track, ""Celebration,"" or whatever, but the rest was the Steamroller Christmas music I know and love. Basically, it's environmentally friendly, and by that I mean recycled melodies and arrangements from previous CDs! I found I prefer instrumental to vocal when listening to Chip & his crew."
1,Hey kids!,"Hey kids! Can you say ""re-released, repackaged, recycled, rehashed, re-used, regurgitated songs?""I knew you could! Now go buy something original!"
2,Wishing I'd read these reviews...,"...BEFORE I asked for (and received) this CD for Christmas. I love Mannheim Steamroller, but I already have the first 3 Christmas CDs and didn't need this ""Greatest Christmas Hits"".I'm also of the opinion that ""Traditions of Christmas"" is much better without the vocals."
2,"Only a ""best of"".... Dissapointing when expecting ""new""","I picked this up at Target, mistakenly thinking it was a ""new"" album... it even said ""2 bonus tracks only available at Target!"". I should have looked at it more closely, and figured out that the rest was on the CD's we already have. So when is Mannheim going to come out with something that is really ""new""??Although we already have close to 100 Christmas CD's, we still look to add new ones from our favorite artists, including Mannheim Steamroller, TransSiberian Orchestra and the Cambridge Singers. At least the other groups put out some new material."
2,More of the same.,"I agree with David. If you are a MS fan, like I am, you already have 98% of it on the first 5 CD's. Why pay $15 - 20 for 1 new song and some added lyrics to a second?"
1,MISLEADING TITLE,"It would have been better to label it ""Best of Mannheim Steamroller Christmas"" than this misleading title. It is just a rehash of selections from their previous albums; all of which I already have so this was a waste of $14 cause stores won't take back OPENed CD's. (anybody got a shrinkwrap machine handy??)"
3,good but needs more older music of chrstmas,yes it was good but too it also need old fashion music not a lot but some and alos some instermental jingle
3,Great Gift if . . .,"Chip serves up the best of his Christmas offerings on one CD with a new track 'Celebration' included. First and foremost this is a fine selection of Chip's best holiday work. The new track 'Celebration' is mediocre and quickly forgotten and to be honest doesn't alone warrant the purchase of this CD.If you know someone that needs a great Holiday CD than you won't find a better value. But if you (or the person you're getting the gift for) already own all 4 of Mannheim Steamrollers Christmas CD's then the new track and packaging doesn't make it worth you're $15.In conclusion this CD has some wonderful holiday music on it, but in the end it's just another ""Greatest Hits"" CD from Chip and Co."
4,Nice Fit - Works Well,"Nice cargo liner...fits well, slides in and out easily. The rubber is a little thinner then I would have liked, I carry mostly large bird cages with sharp edges and when scraping one across the liner, it left a pretty deep gouge. I think for most people it would be ok. It does have a life time warranty, so if you do go through it, they say they'll replace it."
5,Necessary in literature of compassion fatigue,Figley stands out as a pioneer in compassion fatigue studies. This book was essential to my literature review for my Master's research paper and the work I did in New York City as a Red Cross caseworker in response to 9/11.
1,Another money extracter from the mental health professional,"Now the therapist can cash in on the post-traumatic stress disorder craze. No it's not burnout, you are traumatized by helping others who are traumatized. In fact, you think their trauma is yours. We do tough work as trauma workers, we need to take better care of ourselves, but if you lose track of who you are and who you are working with, spend money on a vacation not a book on how bad you have it. You won't get better balance in your life by reading about some new disorder construct someone is promoting to make more of your money."
5,OMG what a steal,"Okay I wasn't sure what I would end up with for $5 a box. I don't know how amazon offers this rate, but it is fantastic! What a deal!"
3,A bunch of research papers,"I was looking for a comprehensive study on testing methods, when I bought this book. I have an academic background, so after looking into the table of contents and skimming through pages in local bookstore, I though I had found right publication. The book has quite solid research foundations and each section provides number of references. Problem is that topics covered in most chapters are too theoretical to be relevant in practice. This book could provide a good background for somebody interested in pure research or writing a PHD thesis, but if you are looking for a clear and well research references in quality assurance it is going to be a waste of 90$ (plus tax). When reading this book, you may want to skip first hundred pages to avoid being exposed to nationalistic arrogance of authors. But, in the same time it was a source of amusement for me; have a read and you will se what I mean :)"
4,GOOD BOOK-RECOMMENDED,"I thought this book was perfect for a beginner. It gave just enough details without going to far or to deep for a raw beginner. I cannot give it five stars because it had a couple of typos, and the website where you are supposed to download the code, does not exist. However I typed in most of the examples myself, and they worked just fine....My one suggestion is that with the Web applications the author should have stated that you must have IIS or Personal WEb Server running to get the web apps to work.All in all it was an easy to read introductory book. It gave me enought of a start to allow me to move into VB.Net."
2,Not Recommended,"This book ""Learn VB.NET by Chuck Easttom"" is easy to read. But lot of mistakes. It seems publishers are in a hurry to release this book with out proper proof reading. Next: code samples, most of them won't work as explained especially in data accessing topics. Not valued for the money. One suggestion for VB.NET reading ""Visual Basic.NET-Your Visual blueprint for building versatile programs on the .NET..."" by Richard Bowman"
2,Not Suggested,"For a book indicated as ""introductory"" there were too many errors in code samples.Reasons for coding as indicated were inadequate.The web link for downloading code samples wasn't correct.I would not recommend this book for beginning VB.NET programming."
1,To many errors in the code.,"I am not a student, but students should hate this professor. All code what he put in the book has errors. Under TCP/IP programming he decides to discuss VB 6.0 Winsock control, which does not work with VB .NET 2003. Wasting money."
2,Did anyone proof read this book?,"I am on Chapter five and have run into several errors that could easily be fixed with simple proof reading. For people that are beginners these typos can hold them up for hours or indefinitely.For example in chapter five, trying to bind data. The clearly states to select OLEDatabaseAdapter and the pictures shows SqlDataAdapter. Well, which is correct? Beginners watch out for the word Private. If your code does not work, use DIM. Otherwise, the book seems to be easy reading. What's the sense if there are mistakes."
5,Fantastic!,"These champagne pliers are absolutely fantastic! They are beautiful and make opening a bottle of champagne so easy and fast you can't believe it. Great buy, well worth the money. I'm picking up a couple more to give as gifts. I notice they're almost out of stock. Hope Amazon keeps carrying them!"
1,Ten Years Younger: The not so amazing Plan.....,"This is just like any other diet book and ""How to Stay Healthy"" plan that is on the market. I really learned nothing new from the information provided. The Title of the book is catchy. In a nut-shell: DO Exercise, Don't Over Eat, and stay away from JUNK: Tabacco ,refined sugars, Alchohol and over- processed foods. Hell, If I had an MD after my name, I can write a book, Too!I have to add, STAY AWAY from ALL foods that contain HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. We are what we eat!"
5,If you are serious about improving the quality of your life,"Nothing is easy about improving your well being, but this book, ""Ten Years Younger"" in little less than three months will totally turn you around and guide you towards better living habits.. It is well written, and the explanations are clear an simple, easy to follow, and you do not need to be a health specialist to understand it - it is well researched and supported by scientific experiment and life long experience by Dr. Masley. You really owe it to yourself to read it. You have nothing to lose, it is a wonderful book. It has lots of wonderful recipes...among other things, Dr. Masley looks kindly to having some dark chocolate from time to time. It is good for you and for me! Jean Vidal"
5,Sound Advice,Excellent book - an easy to understand fool proof program to improve your life. I consider the negative comments made by reviewers to be actually positive. Nothing new here indeed - just proven good advice supported by well regarded scientific studies concerning diet and exercise. There is no miracle cure or groundbreaking advice offered in this book - just tried and true sound advice.
2,"SORRY FOLKS, BUT IT'S THE ABB's WORST ! (it has a few moments, but not many)","The Allman Brothers Band's two Arista Records albums are the weakest in their catalog, and Brothers Of The Road (1981) is the worst of the two. There's not much going on here, and it all sounds pretty thin. It's not a complete waste, I guess. It is The Allman Brothers Band, after all, and Gregg Allman is singing. It's just that all of their other albums are much better. Get this to complete your ABB collection, but don't expect much."
5,LOVE this cereal,"I love to make this cereal with Almond milk. I have many many many food allergies, so this is a great alternative to oatmeal and other hot cereals. I have also used the flakes to make a cookie recipe. It's a little lighter than oatmeal and is super fast to cook once water boils--just add a little salt, sugar, and butter, yum!"
1,Horrible book,"This book is very poorly organized. The author get so excited about CSS and the new coming XML that they neglect to explain the HTML fundamentals, syntax, and capabilities. The author has a tendency to jump from topic to topic without any warning or explanation. I would definetely not recommend this book to advanced programmers nor beginners, it's just too difficult to follow."
2,Okay reference. Waaaay too many mistakes.,"While this book helped me through the basics, it did so in a confusing and round-about fashion. All too often subjects were brought up, only to be glossed over and referenced to a chapter further along in the book. That jumping around made for very confusing reading. It was also dissapointing to see so many chapters written about such off-topic subjects such as verb usage and finding a topic for a web page. This book could have, and should have, been much smaller (read cheaper) for the actual HTML 4 information it contains."
4,Good Reference,"I bought this book a while ago, I think sometime in 2000. It's been very helpful as a reference. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone with no knowledge of HTML. It doesn't teach you HTML so much as it reiterates things the author assumes you already know. It's nice to have if you know HTML and CSS and need to brush up. I find myself pulling it out pretty frequently when I'm building a page and my brain farts out and I need to jog my memory. But for a beginner, this book will likely cause frustration."
2,Not So Good,"Comparing to other books of the Bible family, this book is not satisfactory. It's short of enough figures that can give readers a vivid description of what these codes can make. And the real-world codes are also insufficient. The book is divided into too many chapters, which makes the whole book disordered. The 150-page Appendix is the only highlight of the book. Readers can easily query the usage of keywords. For sure, the book is not suitable to a beginner."
3,would be the best WITH assistent,"this book is great, it explains every thing, it even tells you how to organize yourself before going to publishing your site. However, this would be the best if there is another book about html which includes the all elemnts besides eachother. In this book, you need to go to page 20 for exampl, & page 120 & like that. it doesn't give you the cods in easier way than it is already in the book. I had this book since it was first published, but i stopped reading it & i am reading it now again & i bought a book that has the codes beside eachother & the full length of the code. It was going to be better if the authoers devided teh book into 2 sections. one for explainations & the other part just including the codes & how are they used."
3,Sequels are not always good.,"Was this book really written by the same guy who wrote ""Publish It On the Web""? I was hoping for an update with the same more great tables and an easy to digest format. Ooops! Silly me. If you got a great beginning from Mr. Pfaffenberger, as I did, and are hoping for more screen shot demos of code, you'll be as disappointed as I am. The authors probably should take their own advise on writing concisely (Page 208). The only probelm is that I am not sure what they said on Page 208 or anywhere else. Or maybe they're like my grad school professors who thought if you had to ask a question, you probably weren't a good candidate for the class. So, don't look for this book to teach, just to recap what they assume you already know."
5,Covers too much too lightly.,"I found this book to cover a lot of ground but poorly in some areas. HTML is simple and therefore sould be easier to learn than programing languages. This book is good for reference but weak in aplication. Simply put is you get into HTML and web design this book is only step 1. It is no ""bible"";. (I found other bible books to be better like the one on Photoshop 5)"
5,The Fastest 903 pages I've ever read!,"Okay, well maybe I didn't read every single page, but what I did read was excellent. It's a fast read. Every time I sat down to read a paragraph, I'd find I finished the chapter. The explanations are clear; the examples are relevant. It also makes a great reference. There are so many so-so books out on Web-related topics, but this one is one of the few that I would highly recommend."
1,A Mediocre reference. Beginners Beware!,"I was a beginner when I bought this book and figured I could get pretty much what I needed from a ""bible."" In fact, I found this book to be poorly organized, full of omissions and very confusing to follow. The authors are so excited about CSS that they give HTML short shrift... not good for a book on HTML. I also encountered a lot of fluff on usability that could have been left out, but I suppose bibles are supposed to be thick to justify the price. The chapter on tables totally omits any reference to page layout with tables, something I find really unbelievable. I guess the authors think that CSS makes layout with tables a thing of the past. As a reference I guess this book is okay but it suffers from poor organization. Frankly, I was upset that I spent this much money on such a marginal book."
5,EXCELLENT - MUCH BETTER THAN OEM- ORDER BY THE PAIR,"What a difference. For a few dollars more, you get the best quality. Just installed a pair, and don't expect to ever have to replace again.On-line prices are all over the board, all the way up to $60 (w/s/h) a pair. Again, amazon had one of the best prices(no surprise)."
2,"Good grief -- where's ""Lonely Is The Night""???","I second the earlier reviewer's complaint: ""Lonely Is The Night"" is one of Billy Squier's best and best-known songs, but once again it's inexplicably left out of a Billy Squier compilation.Of course, the songs on this new collection are all good; but the collection itself is a real disappointment."
3,Too Much Missing,"I love Billy Squire...is much underrated rocker. But, why can't they provide a complete hit cd? Where is ""Lonely is the Night"" one of his best? Also missing ""Too Daze Gone"" & Whatta do you Want From me"". Nothing absolute about this at all."
1,Another Compilation?,"Geez, and these record companies still can't get it right. Where is ""Lonely is the Night""? 1 Star for this arrogant oversight."
5,I love it!,"This compilation, while maybe not really comprehensive is still very good, all the good songs of Billy Squier are here and the sound is great. I'm quite pleased with it. I feel that Billy Squier has been underrated, he certainly deserved more credit, among the hard rock of the 80's. This disc brought back so many memories and I really like it. Recommended to anyone who likes Billy Squier."
3,What's the purpose?,"Do we need another Squier greatest hits?Billy probably doesn't even know about this release.The record companies will do anything to make a buck.""Let's do another squier greatest hits!What?there's already 4 out there?Ya,but they don't have this great new cover!And if they're his core fan base they'll buy it just to keep their collection up to date!!"".Keep your money...and go buy the 10th edition,remastered,remastered Motley crue greatest hits!GRRRRRR"
1,Not worth the $$$,"Most study guides have ANSWERS for the problems that are in the TEXT, as well as additional material. This had completely different problems (with answers). So it didn't meet my expectations and I returned it. The publisher's website has a sample chapter from this study guide, which I found after I'd bought/returned this book. I advise looking at the sample chapter so you know what you're getting."
5,All study guides should be this helpful,"This study guide proved to be indispensable in preparing for my cost accounting exam. The content summaries are succinct, logical, and very clear. For each chapter, the guide presents some problems and exercises. These I found to be extremely helpful, because the solutions show not just the correct answer but also the calculations needed to arrive at the answer. The Garrison text would be much improved if the pages and pages of unsolved exercises and problems were replaced by the contents of this Guide."
5,Workbook/Study Guide for use with Managerial Accounting,"This workbook really helped me prepared for the types of questions that are found on the tests. The book's examples and problems are very helpful for learning the material, but they are not the types of questions that you will find on the tests. This workbook will prepare you for those types of questions."
3,Get the Update,Great Book but this author has an update which is better for a Bible Study. This book has no fill in the blanks and we think the newer version is arranged better and allows the reader to look up answers and write them on a blank.
2,Slow,This book was slow and kept on going over the same point. I couldn't get past chapter 2! I would not recommend it to anyone.
3,book Conversation Peace,"The review said that this book was like new - I was very disappointed to receive it with a fair amount of underlining, notes, and highlighting - I definitely would NOT have bought it had I known that! It is definitely not like new!"
4,Good Book,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I love the old style of poetic writing. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes true rhymes.
1,Not what I expected,"This cloth arrived with many stitches in it from where they repaired holes in the rag, also it does not absorb nearly as well as it should."
3,Chamois,"Too small to even dry my corvette. I would sugest you get the 5 sq. ft. version. This thing is like 12"" wide by 24"" long wet and stretched."
1,Horrible product. Doesn't soak up water.,"Not working as expected or intended. I washed my car and I dried soaking up the water stains with this chamois. Nope, it hardly soaked up anything.Do not buy."
4,B-B-Q Review,"We purchased this toy for our son's 2nd birthday. He has enjoyed it. His favorite part is that it has wheels, which allows him to push it around the house or yard. The sound buttons work only once in a while. I am not sure if mine is defective or if that is how it was meant to be made. I had quite a time putting this together as the directions are not extremely clear. Overall, however this was a good toy purchase."
5,Another quality Little Tikes toy,"We love Little Tikes toys - the quality is always excellent and really stands up to the ""playing"" that the kids dish out.We love the bbq - the kids ... love the fact that they can ""cook"" along with Dad. They always want to help him when we have our bbqs but for obvious reasons it's a little dangerous. This is a great solution so they can help with dinner as well. It also gets wheeled around the yard and has been crashed into walls. The kids have also grilled matchbox cars, flowers they've picked from the garden and other toys they find.It's great fun and they love ""cooking along with Dad!""."
4,Grill,"We bought this toy for our three year old son. He loves it!!! We ended up buying him an extra set of ""grill food"" so he could have a varitey of items. My only complaint would be that the grill top comes off easily. I would recommend this item for any kid who likes pretend play!"
1,Target shipping,We have not a good experience with the shipping of the Little Tikes Grill and Glow elctric BBQ. The site says it will ship between 3 and 5 days. We received an e-mail saying it wasn't going to be delivered until Jan. 14. When my husband contacted the customer servie department. They were rude and said there was nothing that could be done. The site currently says it will ship before Christmas. So Beware of ordering!

The funny thing is that it still says the expected delivery date is 1/14/04.
3,Pretty good.,"Pretty good, but this book is not actually alternative history, more historical fiction."
3,"Okay story, not the best writing","Supposedly, one of my ancestors was a soldier in the 13th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment (US), so the story itself was a bit more personal for me than others I've read. One doesn't get a lot of information about this particular assault, and so from that standpoint, I enjoyed it. But I have to agree with another reviewer when he said it had repetitive, weak dialogue. It almost seemed as if the author used a series of stock cliched phrases from Ken Burns' Civil War series. A lot of really corney ""gee-willikers"" kind of speak. I actually felt embarrassed for the characters. I could actually see them standing there as if they were reading the lines from a script and saying, ""Man... I have to say this?"" It's really pretty bad.That being said, however, I recommend it if for no other reason but that there aren't many books written about Fort Pillow."
3,Reviewing Turtledove's Fort Pillow,"Fort Pillow makes a good read for Civil War buffs. I usually like Turtledove's alternate history novels. However, I was disappointed in this real history novel by a real historian. I was surprised that Turtledove took some liberties with the actual history of the Fort Pillow Massacre. And I was truly disappointed that, against just about any Civil War historians, Turtledove had a very forgiving attitude toward Confederate General Forrest. According to most descriptions of the massacre that I have read, the black soldiers in Fort Pillow and their white officers were afraid to surrender to the Confederate troops, knowing how they felt about armed blacks. It is hard to believe that the future founder of the KKK would have treated them any better than he had had theynsurrendered."
5,A great start to the Kaleidoscope Collection,"Any compilation that includes Diamond Hard Blue Apples of the Moon is doing something right.Even though they're out of print, it's worth buying all three volumes, includingPsychedelic VisionsandPsychedelic Frequencies."
4,Good,The bags are not as big as I would have liked but other then that I like them. I use the clear one for work and it can handle a good amount of weight!
3,Not what I expected,"This is a useful bag, but the design and quality are not strong. The straps have many hooks that could be helpful, but aren't functional for me and look odd."
4,A classic,"It is like an old fashond mystery book. It is beutifully written.I recomend this book to mystery lovers. All I can say is, this is one of the best (mystery) book I have read."
4,Excellent Exercises,"I have purchased both the Yoga and Pilates DVD that Carol has made and they are very good and informative. She also has a Ti chi DVD she did before these and she has created wonderful programs that are also easy to follow. I work out sometimes up to 7 days a week and use her DVD's on the days when there is no instructor an find if you follow her and do as she says to,you will see a difference in how you feel and it does help with posture and balance. So try them out for yourself, I think you will agree with me."
3,Funeral Games,"I didn't really like Funeral Games as much as I liked Fire From Heaven and The Persian Boy. There was just too much hatred and bloodshed for me to really enjoy it but I can understand why she made it bloody, it wasn't really a very happy time to be living in, with everyone so ambitious for the crown, and the name of the book is Funearal Games after all. It was still a very interesting book altough the violence did get kind of repetitive. I recommend it to anyone who has read the previous two books but if you haven't then you should read them first, especially The Persian Boy."
2,I never use them because they require more strenghth than I have to use them.,"Right now, they are just taking up space. I haven't used them in years and I would not repurchase them."
3,Very average CD,I bought this CD because I loved their biggest hit but the rest of the CD is really not that memorable and some of the arrangements sound redundant.
1,I heard there was going to be a gangrene bang in here in 5 minutes,"What started out as a part-time gag at House Ear Institute in Los Angeles became just another musical aberration helmed by Cyndi Lauper and ""the guys."" You didn't need to actually have any talent to be in one of these tuxedo-shirt outfits in the Eighties, you just had to have an eye-shadow-enhanced attitude and create a general new-wavey atmosphere ... which, thank you for asking, entailed maracas placed in an echo chamber and reverby notes slowly plucked out of a guitar, or pressed lazily onto a keyboard.Stir. Repeat.Let me put it this way: If you were drawn to this product because you like the song, ""Only the Lonely,"" this album will ruin it for you. This album is Kryptonite to ""Only the Lonely,"" believe me. My advice? Stay somewhere else for the night. (Get it?)"
3,Good for the price,I got these 2 days after I ordered them. None broke during shipping. They aren't perfectly round. Got a bunch of dimples like they've been sitting for a while. I used about 500 last weekend. It was cold but none broke in the gun and most (99%) broke on players. They also flew pretty straight which I wasn't expecting because of the dents. All things considered this is a pretty good deal
2,bad packing,"I have received 12000 paintballs in two shipments and every bag of 500 has at least 1 broken ball in it. In one bag I have found 16 broken balls, what a mess. I have ordered many paintball in the past and the boxes always has had a lot of packing around them, these boxes had one little air bag in them and it was not enough to prevent damage. I like these paintballs for practice the price is very cheep but not worth it when you have to dry and clean that many balls. In the future I will inquire about how they are packaged before I buy the next batch."
5,Comfort and encouragement for those in pain,"Patricia Knight has been suffering with chronic pain for more than twenty-five years, and yet she has found ""pure joy"" through her unshakable faith in God. As one who suffers with chronic pain myself, I have found this book of devotionals to be helpful in learning to view pain as a gift from God and to experience joy and peace even in the midst of pain. Patricia uses characters from the Bible, such as Job (and his wife), Noah, Joseph, and Esther, as well as stories from her own life, to bring insight into ways that God can turn hardships into blessings. Suffering is a part of all of our lives, but we can all learn to have joy that can come only from God."
3,"Music from Cote D'Ivoire is great, but why the high price?","Gadji Celi, soccer player turned solo vocalist, is a great musician, and it's just too bad that I didn't pick up more of his music on CD when I was in Abidjan, because I sure can't afford to pay $40 for one CD on this side! (or anywhere!)"
1,"Sasha and John digweed, know why it's said that way!","...My opinion of stark raving mad is that it is dull, boreing and quiet possible the worst digweed compilation ever. If your looking for something from the weed man try Global Underground Los Angeles, enough said. will I be able to resell this cd for a few bucks?"
5,alternator,I bought this alternator April of 2011. Since it was installed I have not had any problems with it. Overall it was a good buy.
4,An Entertaining yarn,"ALMURIC, a novel found after REH's death, while not up to the standard of Conan and Kull is, nonetheless an entertaining yarn. In the ERB/Mars vein it is a typically Howardian hero, i.e., ""two stupid to do anything but shoot, slash or slug his way into the clear."" (Howard's words)Looking for originality, this ain't it. Looking for a entertaining ligh read and this story should fill the bill."
3,"Quick, entertaining adventure","It won't blow your mind (especially if you've been exposed to lots of planetary romance), but it's a good read for people who like violent pulp adventure. The writing is clear and simple, so that the tale streams by without overmuch effort.Howard wrote much better than this. That said, ALMURIC is still good for satisfying your vicarious bloodlust."
4,"Simple, fun, and action-packed!","Other reviews have touched on the plot and setting, so I'll just skip to:The GoodAlmuric was the most-fun read I've had in a while. There was no epic backstory, no epic world details, no epic character development, and no epic waste of my time. Having slogged through some 300+ page novels recently (see some of my other reviews), the Planet Stories line has been a breath of fresh air. Almuric doesn't take itself too seriously, and the protagonist, while a bit over-the-top (OK, more than a little bit), was not very complex, and contributed to an excellent story that had continuous action, crazy monsters, an impossible enemy, and a little bit of heart.The BadNot too much, really. The novel is what it is, so if you're looking for deep insight into the human condition - forget it. It's pure escapist fantasy.4.25 stars!"
2,Not what I ordered,I ordered the 'Jesus Loves me' tape and I did not get that one. I don't want to teach my child about the singing dolphin. I want here to know about Jesus. So I am dissatisfied.
1,Outdated,"All I have to say about this is that the book was published in 1998 and is now 14 years old. In a hotly contested field such as this, it is more helpful to stay current in the literature. A specific, exhaustively peer-reviewed text which was recently published is this one:Dissociation and the Dissociative Disorders: DSM-V and Beyond by Paul F. Dell and John A. O'Neil (Apr 20, 2009)I suggest that if you are truly interested in the phenomenon of DID/MPD, read more recently published books. ""Rewriting the Soul"" was written during the heated years of the media war between the ""False Memory Syndrome Foundation"" and the medical/psychological profession. Naturally this book was greatly influenced by that sociopoliticized time. Times have changed, whatever your perspective on this diagnosis."
3,About what I expected,"This works fairly well. The only problem I had was that objects get a little distorted at the edges of the shield. It also warps a little in hot weather and makes creaking noises if it is not folded completely up against the visor. I also would have preferred one that could slide to the side since I drive a Jeep Wrangler and the windshield is far away from the seat, and I get the sun shining on the side of my face a lot. I also get a lot of sun shining in between the driver side and passenger side visors."
2,"Great Idea, poor execution",We used a similar product on another car and found it necessary for my wife is a little shorter than average. We purchased a new car and the original one broke while installing it. The Sun Zapper also broke after 3 months of use. Repaired it by replacing the plastic rods with a full length brass tube (glued on with epoxy). Tried to install it and then one of the plastic clips broke after moving the shield a few times. The sun visor is especially thick and padded. Another type of clamping mechanism should be designed for the Sun Zapper to make it more durable. Not worth the money as currently designed.
1,Waste of money,"I gave it one star only for the purpose of allowing a submittal for review. The premise seems to be logical, but the actual product is inferior. The surface is wavy which in turn distorts the image. It doesn't deserve a rating and I'm surprised it is promoted. Five thumbs down!"
3,Sun Zapper Glare Shield (TWI-8001),"This is a super idea in theory, however, it is too heavy for both my husband's car and my car. It won't stay up when it's not needed. It comes down every time we hit any kind of bump (not falling off, but flips down). Then, every couple of minutes I have to push it back up. I fell in love with the idea and ordered two. I now have mine sitting in the passenger's seat next to me; I have no idea where my husband put his. When the sun is glaring right into my eyes and practically blinding me, it is a fantastic shield and I can then see where I'm going with no problem at all and I love that part. (My husband has a Camry, and I have a LeBaron and maybe it is just our vehicles ... but I don't think so)."
3,Visor Attached Glare Shield,"I have used these glare shields on the visors in our Toyota Corolla. They have worked ok, given their inexpensive cost. The sliding panel, that adds an adjustable double darkened area, has come off and will no longer stay attached. I still find these glare shield beneficial."
2,not clear,The plastic is too warped to see clearly through but it works well when used on the side window to block glare from the side.
1,Sun Zapper is too small to do any zapping.,"The sun zapper is too narrow to be of any help. When attached to the visor appropriately, it is too high to be of help unless you are very tall. I am average height and it doesn't block the sun at all unless its nearly noon."
1,Garbage,"I had purchased two of these for two different cars based on overall 3.5 rating given here. The clips are made of cheap plastic and do not open wide enough to get them on anything but the thinnest of visors without snapping in two. Or three, or four. But the worst part is the ""shield"" itself. As with several other commentors, the distorted plastic is terrible and dangerous. But the worst, which I didn't see reviewed, was that the ""shield"" doesn't reduce glare or the intensity of the light AT ALL! Nada! You could burn your retinas waiting for this thing to work!"
3,Works well for me,"This product is what I wanted mainly because of the glare that comes in the passenger window at eye level. I am 5'3"" and the car visor is never low enough when it is swung over to the side. It is cooler and less irritating than having the sun shine right on the side of my face during long drives. The amber plastic has some waves when looking through it out the windshield but it doesn't bother me.6 months later I have to mention that the weight of this has caused my sun visor to lose it's spring. I had to replace the visor. This is not as heavy as the visor cases that hold CD's so it was unexpected. I still like the Sun Zapper but I can't use it anymore."
1,piece of junk,this prodcut sucks. as the other reviewer said the visor is made of cheap plastic and it distorts your view and gave me an instant headache. also its much smaller than i thought. i think if it had distotion free visor it would be a so so product but save the hassle of having to return it.
2,not as good as it looks,I bought two of these items. ONe for each car. I don't think the clarity is as good as wearing sun glasses or as clear as I expected. I do use them at times. But I do not feel it works as well as I thought. I dont recommend it....
4,Does the job,"I read all the reviews on this sun visor; clearly you either liked it or hated it. Since I needed something to block the glare on the drive home I bought this. I am not disappointed. I wouldn't want a pair of sunglasses made out of this plastic, but I have no trouble seeing through it. That wave distortion everyone talks about is there, but it's not that bad and if I have the visor down and not angled it's almost imperceptable. I have a slender sun visor in my car so the clips on this glare screen slide on just fine. It cuts down the glare and that's what I wanted. If I were the maker of this product I would improve the screen, perhaps a good sunglass material with no distortion? I also like the slidable sunspot blocker. So overall, not perfect but not terrible and I like this product!"
3,Sun Zapper,The product is a visor extension. It folds up and down easily. The sliding sun blocker segment works reasonably well if you are a one eyed driver. Despite that deficiency this product will make you a safer driver when driving into the sun.
2,Clip problems,Problem with clip. Snapped when I tried to use the visor. Attaching it now by a rubber band.
3,Sun Zapper Innovative Glare Shield,the sliding Dark part of the Sun Zapper Glare Shild is a good idea but is hard to adjust to visually
3,"Decent quality, but too small.","Like the quality of the product, but needs to be wider and deeper to give best coverage sun glare protection."
3,not full clear,"It's ok but not very clear .... but it's make job.I recommanded this article. When the sun is so hard,i love it.Thank you for your delivery so fast."
4,great helper,I bought this item for myself and five friends. It's not something you use every day but when you encounter morning or before sundown sun glare it's a life saver.
4,Sun Zapper,If you drive into the sun everyday this is a great item. Easy to attach and use. Really helps block out the sun so you can see to drive safely. The clip that holds the Sun Zapper to the visor broke one day while putting it down. The clips need to be stronger.
4,Review of Trillium Sun Zapper,"The Trillium Sun Zapper is a terrific idea, long overdue. It is deep enough to cut late afternoon sun for even a short person. What would make it infinitely better would be a four-inch horizontal extension that slides out to elongate the visor when it is used on the driver's or passenger's side window. As it is, it's most useful only when the sun comes directly through the front windshield. If this innovation is made, I'd like to sign up to be a salesperson."
5,Sun Zapper,"Since I've always hated wearing sun glasses, this Sun Zapper is very useful to me. I can easily move it to the passenger side if that is where I need it. In fact, I'll probably order another one and then two more for our other car. It is very effective in blocking the very bright sunshine. It cleans easily with eyeglass wipes. I've told many friends about what a handy gadget this is."
1,Good Idea....Flawed Product,"The Sun Zapper is a good example of a good product idea gone bad due to a cheap manufacturing process. I guess I was expecting to much from a product that only cost around $15.00 to $19.00. My main disappointment was the poor optical quality of the amber plastic sun shield. The first time I used my Sun Zapper I pulled it down into position to block the late afternoon sun only to see a sort of wavy, slightly distorted, slightly soft image of the road ahead. It reminded me of a very cheap pair of sunglasses or some very cheap window tint plastic material. All of these optical defects are amplified by the strong backlight of the sun on the amber shield.This could have been a great product if they had a higher price point and used a near optically clear grade of amber colored plastic. SORRY, BUT I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
3,Distorted but darker,"This visor-extender is a good idea, but the two problems I found in MY sample were very distressing. The Darker of the two pieces slides smoothly and easily, but it does NOT ever disappear- you are forced to see it at all times. It should be either removable, or at least flippable to reduce the distraction. The second problem, possibly just in MY sample, is the severe distortion in the plastic. The waviness was very distracting, almost hiding smaller items in the line of sight. I hope the rest of the stock is of a better Optical quality, to soothe the eyes and to protect the driver from the glare and brightness that tends to attack the eyes and the driver's brain!"
4,A worthy gadget for long drives,"I ordered several--on for both visors of my car, and one for my son, who drives long distances. The sun-zapper may be a life saver in unfamiliar towns with major intersections. During certain seasons and times of day, glare can seriously obstruct the driver's vision, sometimes even making it impossible to see traffic lights. This gadget cuts down on that effect, making driving safer and more comfortable. Also, when used in heavy night traffic the sun zapper softens the glare of oncoming headlights."
1,did not last,"I think it lasted maybe a week and then it fell apart. Good idea, look for something else dont waste your money on this one."
1,Sun Zapper Disappointment Reigns,"I recently purchased two Sun Zappers and after installing them came to the conclusion that the Sun Zapper was a great idea that was poorly designed and cheaply manufactured. The optical quality of the amber tinted plastic is terrible.Looking through the plastic sheet you will see a somewhat wavy, distorted image of the road in front of you. It is worse than looking through a pair of very cheap sunglasses at the setting sun. This would be a great product if they would use a higher grade of optically clear amber plastic and polarize the lens element. I was expecting to much for $15.95"
4,Very effective tool.,"Nice gadet for driving into the sun. Not only for the old folks! Beware of the ""visor width"". Would be nice if clips were adjustable to avoid ""mirror blinds within the sun visor of the car""."
2,Not as good as I thought,"I purchased this sun visor since I'm often times driving directly towards the sun, but it isn't as great as I thought it would be. It's narrow and it's more of a distraction than it is helpful. I think it would almost be better to just have the small, darker piece to maneuver where needed."
5,Sun blocker,Great product that us truly universal fit. Esaly flips up when not needed and has area that can be moved when extra blockage is needed.
4,Commuters helper.,I was driving home facing west every night. Every night my regular visor would soon be of no help from the blinding setting sun. I purchased one of these and believe it kept me from several commuting accidents.
3,Good enough,"The glare shield works well, but the extra panel is ineffective against the sun. Otherwise it does an adequate job."
3,Good for use at night,"I don't use this during the day as much, but it is great for use at night. I have trouble with my eyes adjusting from the glare of oncoming headlights. This takes a lot of that out. If I owned more than one vehicle, I would buy another for it.January 2011 - I still like this item, but it breaks easily... just wish they'd constructed it a little better... breaks at the clamp... think the little piece of plastic should have been reinforced."
2,Too much filler,There are too many puppet segments and other non-Caillou fillers in this DVD set. You will find yourself fast-forwarding every 3-5 minutes. Very annoying.
2,Uggh! Puppets on both!,"My family loves Caillou, but these DVDs will likely get donated to our local library. There are many cute episodes on these videos, all featuring a younger Caillou and Rosie; unfortunately, interspersed are those annoying puppets that kids seem to hate. Unless you don't mind having the remote in hand, ready to fast forward, I'd skip these DVDs and opt for the newer puppet-less Caillou videos."
5,Happy customer,My son is a major cailou fan so he loves his gift. Goes perfect with his portable DVD player since we don't always want to watch the shows when he does which is all the time. :)
5,Caillou - Caillou's Family Fun/Caillou's Holidays,I had never heard of Caillou until looking for a Christmas gift for my grandson. In talking to my daughter she said he loved the program on PBS channel. When Silas received his movie he was so excited that he could watch it any time he was allowed. Well I guess he liked the movies so much he didn't want to go to school the next day (HE LOVES SCHOOL)! So the gift was a hit!
4,Wonderful,My toddler loves caliou so it was a great investment. He got this as a christmas present and has not stopped watching it since. The only thing that could be better is if you could buy one disc with many episodes on it.
1,NGK spark plugs,"I've already reviewed this once, but here goes again....the plugs are fine; however, I ordered 8, got 7 (which doesn't work well)...then another much later. In the process of trying to find an 8th plug I came to realize that the local Reilly auto part store sells them for half the price that I purchased them for on Amazon...so, I returned them and got a credit."
1,Did not fit my F150,"I ordered this item after checking if it fit my truck F150 5.4L V8. Amazon web site said it fits my truck. Unfortinatly I did not have the time to istall it on my truck and I lost my right to return it, THEY DO NOT FIT MY TRUCK."
4,OK but nothing special,"An ok page turner, but no big payoff in the end. The authors mixed up everything including the Borg, Preservers, Romulans, Ferengi, Klingons, TOS, TNG... and the result was slightly dissapointing for me, but I'm still glad I read it."
5,A Wonderful Read for Technical Trekkies,"It helps to be familiar with the Classic Trek episode featuring Zefram Cochrane, but it's not essential to enjoy the story. You will learn all about warp impellers, impulse drive and the warp theory! The baddie in the story is almost as hideous as the Borg. Although it may seem that Kirk and Picard will be brought together in this story, their contact is limited and really secondary to what's going on with Cochrane. It puzzles me that the Zefram Cochrane in the movie First Contact in no way resembles the Cochrane of either the TV show or this novel, but no matter. I've got Federation on audiobook too, and Mark Lenard does an exceptional reading of it. You can't go wrong either way."
4,Brilliantly Written,"This book grasps you and never lets go until the end. The Zephrem Cochrane character in this book has diametrically opposed characteristics as the one in First Contact, in a good way. The only disappointment I have is that Kirk and Picard never met face-to-face, as I expected. But the novel is brilliantly written with vivid descriptions and surprises from the Old Series. Don't miss the great quote on the very first page"
4,Excellent plot by two gifted authors.,"First, of all, the reason I give this book a 7 is because for the first 60 pages or so the plot seems to go nowhere. Although after it began to pick up the storyline was relentlessly exciting. The tale of both of the ships was woven masterfully along with a truly evil villain. The plot centers around Zefram Cochrane, inventor of the ""warp drive"", and the mission of both Enterprises. The story is neatly tied toghether with no ends left undone. All in all, Federation is a great book that you don't have to be a fan of Star Trek to enjoy"
4,Good Read,"The best way to describe this book would be to compare it to the Star Trek Movie Generations. It brings the series together like the Movie does and is done very well. If I'm not mistaken, I do believe I read the book many years ago and enjoyed reading it again."
5,Great Adventure Book!,"I am a fan of Star Trek (Next Generation) but I do not like ""fan fiction"".That said, I feel like ""Federation"" really captured the voice and essence of all the Star Trek characters, and created interesting villains/situations. It was a bonus that both Kirk and Picard are in one book together. The story moves fast, it's very well written and is good enough to stand alone as a sci fi adventure novel without leaning on the Star Trek franchise. 5 stars!"
3,Okay but I don't get what all the hype is about,"I decided to read this book based on all the positive reviews here. The novel definitely has a broad scope, we see Kirk and Picard's crew, as well as a new storyline involving Zephram Cochrane in the 21st century.It's an okay read, but I can't accept that this is THE Star Trek novel to read. Without giving anything away, let's just say I thought more than one plot point involving the villain wasn't very plausible, and that's where the novel lost me.Perhaps it's my fault for not knowing more about science or astronomy, but I was also lost in the later parts of the book by the Star Trek techno-babble. Although they should get credit for attempting to explain how faster than light travel is possible.I don't usually read Star Trek novels. I'll probably read another one in the future. I guess what I was looking for was a grittier, tighter story that focused solely on one crew (and maybe had a more believable villain)."
5,"A creative, yet believable book.","In this great piece of literature, a great writing team puts forth an excellent and complex storyline.Both authors consummate their usage of Star Trek lore, their own creative ideas, and their ability to replicate each character's individuality.The story begins as three separate plots. The first takes place in the mid-twentyfirst century, and describes how Zephram Cochrane used his warp drive to foil, and escape from the earth-dominating Optimum Movement. The second outlines Kirk's discovery of Cohrane himself on a barren planet. The third describes how the Enterprise-D discovers an interesting artifact from one of their most dangerous enemies.These plots are combined ingeniously and unexpectedly. In order to find out how though, you have to read the book. I give it a 9.which as the story progresses, slowly and steadily intertwine.The plot is slow to develop, but it is interesting to read about"
5,A great story combining both ST crews and Star Trek history!,"This is definetely one of the best Star Trek novels I've read. The best elements of the novel were the use of 3 different timelines combining into one pretty good story, as well as the history provided on the life and accomplishments of Cochrane. The ""meeting"" of the two crews was one of the weaker parts of book, I felt.All in all, however, it's a must read for star trek fans. Particularily if you want more insight into star trek history and if you enjoy books with different plot streams that culminate into one conclusion."
5,great book,i loved this book.i loved the way the generations came together.iloved the story of zefram cochrane.i loved colonel thorsen he's a reallygood bad guy.i lent my copy to a freind who dosen't really like star trek and he loved it.i don't know if i've mentioned this or not but i just loved this book.buy it
1,The Worst Book I Ever Read!!!,"This is by far the worst Star Trek novel I ever read. The shifting from one generation to the next was rough and made the story very boring. The two crews never worked with each other to the point that you, as a reader, feel good. The movie Generations was by far a better effort to bring the different crews together. This was a big disappointment."
5,"Fascinating, . . . Interesting, and an overall good read","FederationThis was truly a great read. The story was really compelling and although it tended to jump between timelines from one chapter to the next, it was no problem keeping up. I think the title was a little misleading and the story was definitely written before the events of the TV series - Enterprise. Still, the little inconsistencies didn't detract from the overall storyline which covered the pre-warp Earth to the 24th century Starfleet and at the end, beyond.I thought it was a difficult book to put down and I enjoyed it completely. I'd recommend this book without hesitation."
4,READ THIS ONE,"I am in the process of going back and reading some of the older ST:TOS novels that I a) have nevr read or b)read so long ago that I had forgotten them. This is an excellent melding of the two series without the characters actually meeting one another. (at the time they originally wrote this novel, Roddenbery wanted the casts kept separated, I think.) What can I tell you? Zefram Cochrane, the companion, the eugenics wars, time travel, a very nasty Data (though not his fault), the Borg , the Preservers. This one is worth reading."
2,I couldn't finish it.,"The dialog was more than I could handle. The interchange between the characters was so esoteric it was like reading another language at times. Stella Cameron is so talented, but there are a few of her books that go beyond imagination. I was looking forward to this one, especially after French Quarter. What a disappointment."
1,Disappointing,"I found the story implausible. The sexual intimacy reached much too early in the book to be believable -- especially for the time period. The dialog was repetitious and vague. This seemed to be deliberate to add mystery to the plot, but instead it seemed boring."
2,Nowhere near her best...,"I have loved all of Ms. Cameron's Mayfair Square books and highly recommend the series as a whole, but I had to work to finish this one. In her other stories she creates passion that is also romantic, but this time the sex scenes ( I cannot call them love scenes, as that emotion is notably absent) felt forced on the reader, and the characters hardly more than lustful strangers. And after wading through all the foreplay, she glosses right over the true consumation. Badly done, Stella!"
2,What A Disappointment!,I think the author really lost my attention with the rambling of conversation between the charaters. I found it hard to follow the story line and at points felt like putting the book away.
2,Boring,"I am a huge Stella Cameron fan, I have enjoyed her past works and look forward to her up in coming book Key West but More and More was a disapiontment. The love story was boring and the ending was perdictable."
4,"Good Stuff, Good Price, Minor Issues","Rock wool is great stuff, and this was a good price with reasonable shipping costs. They shipped it very fast, it cam in good condition, and that's all good. The minor issue was that it was labeled 2x2x2 and it was really 2x2x1.5. Maybe I should have known, but it bugged me. On the other hand, when I wrote them about it they responded fast and were nice about it. So over all, I like the product and the seller, I just wish they would have labeled it more accurately."
1,Rockwool exp,I did not have good results with this product. I do not recommend buying it as it falls into pieces.
1,Horrible book,This book has no plot. It is only introductions about snobby rich women and no story.Do not waste your time.
2,"Good descriptions, but no depth","Like previous reviews, I agree this short easy to read really had no point and had an uneventful ending. Descriptions of the women, their children and their gorgeous houses was good. Bit too many exclusive brand dropping. Okay, I get it. They're rich! Most of the book introduced us to the characters, with a chapter dedicated to the meeting.After a while, I lost track of who was who. They all blended into a mass group of pretty privileged women. I think I would have enjoyed it more if there were half the number of characters, going deeper into their lives and a slightly longer book. I didn't see any lesson learned or growth of characters. I appreciated the irony of the book they ""read"", and the quotes at the beginning of each chapter but it wasn't enough to redeem it in my eyes."
2,Can't believe all the good reviews. . .,"because this book is terrible. Yes, it is amusing and engaging but it is so cliche and trite. It makes John Grisham seem like Faulkner. The characters are so expected and their some of their names are just ridiculous. What 40 year old woman is named Madison? Giselle is a former model - puhleese. I grew up in Bronxville and I know the kinds of women who appear in this book. Yes, they are silly and caught up in their childrens' lives but somehow I always felt they had more going on then just that. The women in this book are more superficial than anyone I know from Bronxville. And thank goodness for that! Lastly, this book is filled with spelling and grammatical mistakes. Where was the editor?"
2,"Interesting characters, no plot","Just as you start to get interested in the characters of this book, the book is over. The book is about a book club that takes place in the a well to do suburb in Westchester, NY. However, absolutely nothing happens in the book. There is no plot, no climax, nothing. Moreover, the characters are so shallow, conceited, and spoiled that it is hard to really like any of them. I do not recommend this book at all."
2,"A quick, amusing read, but not much more...",This book offers many laughs and accurate insights into Bronxville's society gals and the many who aspire to become them. Unfortunately the character development is very limited and the writing is just average and really can't even be evaluated in any literary way.
1,SUPERFICIAL AT BEST,"I can't believe this is the same book that other reviewers on this website are raving about. Perhaps they are friends of the author? I picked up this book because of the reference to ""I Don't Know How She Does It"" - what a mistake. I had to get through too many chapters describing one-dimensional characters (none of whom a reader would want to know, with the exception of Francesca) before I got to the actual book club meeting. Not much of a meeting! It was over before it even started.I was bored to tears with this book. If you're a fan of good literature, don't bother picking it up."
1,In desperate need of proofreading,"I can't believe this book made it through and was published. It lacked a plot, had one dimensional characters, and so many typos I had to resist pulling out my red pen and making corrections. The only thing creative about it were the names of the women. They were different and interesting names. At only 169 pages it read more like a short first draft before the author would do some more developing. Skip this one."
5,The Bronxville Book Club,"THE BRONXVILLE BOOK CLUB is a cleverly composed fable about an imaginary book club which meets evenings, once a month, in Bronxville, New York. The women in the club are all very special and different, but they look forward to coming together in order to socialize and to analyze a favorite book.In her description of each participant's interests and idiosyncrasies, author Pamela Hobson has given us delightful insights into the motivations and interests of these very different book club personalities. Portraits of the club members and their families are wittily, yet compassionately drawn.Readers who belong to community book clubs, as well as readers who do not, will enjoy this delightful story."
4,GREAT ACTING,"DUVALL AND HARRIS ARE EXCEPTIONAL, I REALLY WANT THIS MOVIE BUT AT $40....I'LL SIMPLY WAIT FOR A PRICE REDUCTION. I DON'T UNDERSTAND??!!"
2,Bought it - can't play it,This item cannot be played on a DVR! Can only be played only on a DVD PLAYER not a DVD PLAYER/RECORDER which is what I have.Would have been nice to know that limitation BEFORE I purchased it. Could have saved me the shipping costs to return it.I have searched for this movie on DVD for years. It's one of my favorite movies of all time. Very disappointing!
2,A Review of Pampers Feel 'n Learn,"I suppose these work for some boys, but apparently not ours. Our 3 year old may be getting the `wetness signal' but it's not 'loud' enough for him to react to. No rushing to the potty for him, though occasionally he will go get a new diaper so he can be changed.For my part, I am also less than thrilled with the Feel 'n Learn product because Pampers has reduced the overall amount of absorbency as compared to their other diapers. This reduction in absorption means that we need two different types of diapers around for daytime use; these (until they are all gone) and the regular Pampers which have much better absorbency; good enough to last through a shopping trip.Two Stars. Give it a try but don't spend alot of money lest they not work out for you either."
3,Training pants,"This work okay,as long as you are using them as training pants. If you are using them as a substitute for diapers then you will want something else."
4,Emir,"The book is excellent for students and beginners in the field of ultrasound. The information provided is optimal for self-practice and improvement your practical skills as well as theoretical. The only one issue concerning the book is the date of last edition (1999). However, how much it changed? Anyway, I recommend this book to those who are about to start ultrasound scanning."
3,"Ultrasound Scanning,Principles and Protocols of Betty Bates","this book is basic, has many pictures without color , and schematic pictures,but has basics comments ,hasn`t photos , I recommended others books ,for example Introduction to Vascular Ultrasonography ,the autor is Zwiebel"
4,No problems,I had no worries. I was notified quickly through out the whole transaction and shipping process.
4,Great Leaning Tool......,"Highly recommened for anyone studying to become a Sonographer in a didactic, clinical or Hospital setting. If you have difficuly making out what you are seeing on the monitor, or knowing what images you should be taking, This book is the ticket. :)Caution: Not a substitute for formal traninig!....."
1,Zoo tycoon,I thought I was ordering the Windows version. I received the Mac version which I cannot run.
3,This is an All Over Good Book,"I read ""Blood Ties"" when I was 13. My reading of suspense and mystery novels had been limited to a very small range of books written for my age group. Therefore, as I read the book and encountered gory and frightening scences I was appalled. It took me about a week to finish it, which was kind of a slow pace for me but, several times I had put it down, resolving not to read it anymore because I was scared half out of my wits. I'd always been able to guess the ending of stories, and I could usually figure out who the ""bad guy"" was before it was revealed. This book kept me guessing and reading until almost the last page. It was well written, and although I was still young when I read it, I think they could have left out some of the more gory parts. I mean come on, this is a christian novel!!!! I would'nt recommend it to everyone, but if you like horror and suspense, you've gotta read this book!"
1,Way too violent!,I read this book based on liking other books by Sigmond Brouwer. I found this book about a seriel murder much too violent especially for Christian fiction genre.
5,"Great Price, Easy Installation, Function Is As Advertised","I bought this additional memory to upgrade my computer. (I've been tinkering inside my computers for 23 years.) It arrived a day or two before I expected it, which is always good.This Kingston ValueRam was easy to install, as opposed to some other products. Sometimes what you order isn't as simple to install as you're led to believe. Installing this was just a matter of plugging it into the memory card slot. I immediately noticed an increase in my computer's speed. So far, it's performing quite well - I have no complaints.Bottom line: Kingston ValueRam is a good product - it's easy to work with, works great in my computer, and didn't cost me an arm and a leg. I'd recommend it to anyone."
5,Good enough,"Although I should know more about a computer's inside... given that I sudy Comuputer Science, I really can't judge very well this item. I haven't had any problem to this day, and my computer is obviously faster. If you need a sincere recommendation, here it is, but beware my apparent lack of knowledge. Other reviews seem to be good as well.I can say it's a good investment, the price is right for the value received."
5,Working perfectly so far,"Although It is soon to do this review , (it's been a while since I bought the Kingston memory but only assembled and started testing it about a week ago ) I can say is that so far everything is working very well . During instalation the system recognized the memory right away and it is working pretty fast and stablely. So , again, so far , a good choice , considering price/product quality."
5,PERFECT!,"I listen to this CD everyday and I'm still not tired of it. This CD contains all of Cristian's biggest hits from his previous albums - Lo Mejor De Mi, Mi Vida Sin Tu Amor, and Azul; plus several additional tracks. Cristian's talent and soothing voice has made him one of Mexico's most popular male singers (just listen to ""Yo Queria"" or ""Por Amarte Asi"" to understand why). This is a must buy for all fans of Cristian."
3,No precisamente la mejor selección,"Christian Castro tiene una gran voz y ha tenido excelentes canciones en su carrera discográfica, pero como suele suceder frecuentemente en recopilaciones, la selección de temas probablemente no fue la mejor. Quedaron fuera grandes temas como Por amor a ti, Para ti, Vuélveme a querer, Ángel, No podrás, etc.Sin embargo, con sus temas nuevos vuelve a renovarse y son los que hacen que valga la pena comprar este cd, aun para quienes ya tienen sus discos anteriores. Especialmente recomiendo el primer sencillo, Cuando me miras así."
4,fun for basic geography practice,This game is fun and quick paced. It gives a good introduction to geography if you simply want to learn where countries are located throughout the world. My 8 and 10 year olds play it and are learning from it.
3,Body Pillow,"The pillow is very comfortable. However since it is feather, it doesn't seem to have enought feathers. It isn't thick enough for me or my girlfriend."
2,M.Patton,I was VERY disappointed in this product!!! it was REALLY heavy and prickly feeling!!! WOULD HAVE SENT BACK BUT TOO MUCH HASSLE AND POSTAGE!
4,"Ouch, but Ahhh.","This book makes my brain hurt, but in a good way. Some of the essays are pretty tough to read as they are very deeply rooted in the world of art historical criticism, but don't let that stop you from getting this book; you'll learn a lot and come away with some good insights into the subject of photography and the history of photography. It would be very helpful to get a companion book that contains some of the artists and works that are discussed here, so you have the images to look at and non-critical, historical looks at the artists for background and context. Something like Beumont Newhall's ""History of Photography"" would be an excellent match."
5,Medieval Times,"Another great album by GMS. There are several good tracks on this album but the best is ""Medieval times"", which alone is worth the price of the album. ""Jaws"" is another great track for example. Very high energy techno trance."
2,"Fascinating subject, not well presented.","This book is not very well written. It's unfortunate that the author finds himself in such exciting situations (a tuskectomy!) and then is unable to clearly communicate with the reader. The scope of the book is limited (a few veterinary situations, all within a convenient commute for the author) and to me (a pre-vet student) the writing is boring, stiff, and uninspiring. For those who may never get to see real-life veterinary trauma I wish there had been more than a dry book report about the procedures. Stick to James Herriot - you'll be much happier."
1,Not what was expected. Electronic meditation music? Give me a break!,Be careful to know what you are looking for in terms of meditative music titled Tai Chi etc. Be sure to to preview before buying.
5,Great for a home mechanic,"This was the last tool I needed to finish about $2000 of work on my Audi.It worked perfectly, is solidly made, and looks like it will last a lifetime."
5,lisle 30800 cv boot clamp pliers,"the best clamp ever i bought, work really good and can be extend for bigger c clamps to tight it better."
1,Roberto Il Diavolo,The current volume being offered is an old Italian recoding starring Renata Scotto as the female lead and Boris Christoff in the title role. This recording has been around several decades on a variety of labels. It simply isn't worth it. It is heavily cut -- it is the Italian version not the original French. This is a magnificent opera but you would never know it listening to this version. There is a recording of the French version with Samuel Ramey in the title role taped during a live production at the Opera in Paris -- get this one. It is the only one worth owning.
5,Awesome Tool Bags,Dead on makes one baddass set of tool bags. comfortable durable great! goes great with a dead on framing hammer as well :)
3,1 size fits all not,"1 size fits all does not work for this product.It does not fit me propertly,I have to have the belt drawn to the hilt and it still slides down on me. And the shoulder harness does not fit because the belt is drawn so tight. Its also so big that it falls off my shoulders. I have co-workers who have belts that fit them without all the trouble. I would have never got this belt if I had the chance to try it on."
1,Save Your Money,"I've been a siding contractor for 9 years, worked in construction for 13 years. I paid full retail at another store, but even at this price here, still not worth it. Used for three months, and the stitching that holds pouch to the belt came apart and the pouch fell to the ground. These are the worst bags i have ever owned. Useless, useless. Junk. Save your money. I guess if you are a person who will wear these once every other month they might do okay, they are NOT for everyday use. The material is very thin."
3,Bina Na Ngai Na Respect,Eventhough I have not listenned to the cd i wish to comment that the late Franco's music has always been my favorite artist from the republic of Zaire now Congo well they keep changing from now and then. But anyway the thing is that I have very strong feeling that the next listner will be very satisfied with whatever they have bought.
1,The picture is wrong,"I gave ita 1 satr because it advertises front pads. But, when i recieved the order. It was rear break pads :("
4,Stanley Kubrick: A Guide to References and Resources,Another of those hard to find volumes about the late director. This contains no real information about his work but is an index of books and other sources of information about the director and his works. Much like other out of print books it does not cover his last few movies but does aid in researching his earlier works. A useful volume to add to your library.
4,More Fun for all ages,"Ok, I admit I love playing with Legos and Megabloks. It's my firm belief that you're never to old to Lego. Anyway, I bought a couple of these models for myself and enjoyed putting them together. I enjoyed even more, combinig the two sets and making an even better looking mech. For some real fun, combine this with the U-240 Assault, and the Night Force Optic. For fans of big walking robotic warmachines, these are just Great!"
3,Good inroduction to hungarian cooking,"I have hungarian heritage, and needed a cookbok to serve finer dishes for our guests. I live in the USA and appreciated that all the measurements and temperature was translated to the american system. By now I have tried 10 different dishes and I am disapointed. Everything tastes the same. As my husband puts it: Your normal hungarian dishes has a firecracker of tastes in comparison to these recepies. So if you need inroduction, try it. If you would like to get the best of hungarian cooking this is just not good enough."
3,Great for someone just getting started with Hungarian cooking,"I purchased this as a gift for my brother. All of us siblings enjoyed grandma's and mom's real Hungarian cooking and like to dabble ourselves. My brother is a very decent cook but was lacking a nice Hungarian cookbook. As I scanned this one, I noticed many of our family favorites. This is a simple and attractive little book that I'm sure he and his family will enjoy.I have several Hungarian cookbooks that look and read like History books. While interesting and well written, they are not as easily navigated. This is better for the busy cook who just wants good Hungarian food."
4,Hungarian Cooking,"Excellent cookbook,interesting addtional information. Recepies close to mum's. A bit of a shame that it contained no creative photographs but that was known at the time of purchase. The real value is in the authentic recepies."
4,pretty good racing game,"The amount of cutscenes is low, for some reason. Other than that, Need for Speed Most Wanted gives us mostly fast-paced racing action that you are sure to come back to again and again.The difficulty is the main problem with the game. Cars can come out of nowhere and get in the lead in no time at all, even if you think you're fully in the lead. It's not really fair and that's the only problem I have.Pick up this excellent racing game to see how driving around can be a lot of fun."
1,Not a good buy.,"If you liked Need for Speed Underground 1 or 2, you will not like this game at all. The only fun thing about it is the fact that you get chased by the police. You can't customize you ride nearly as much as the previous entries. On top of that, the available cars aren't as much fun as you would think(and there are NO hondas or nissans, that means no S2000, no NSX, no RSX, no 350z, and no Skyline). The graphics are glitchy. A good rent, but definitly don't buy this game. Go buy Need for Speed Underground 2."
4,Another great NFS,"Just like the last few Need For Speed games, this is awesome. There are plenty of fun race modes and the run ins with the police are very fun. NFS made a great change from Underground 2 by giving the player the option to jump straight to the race instead of driving around the large map to find the next race (which you can also do if you choose). The rides aren't as customizable as Underground, but that's not really what this game is about anyway. The graphics are great, especially the cut scenes and the sound effects are cool, too. The acting, as always, is terrible, but who really cares, that's not why we play NFS. I've gotten many many hours of game play out of this one, and I'm still only about half way through the game. This is a great buy for any racing game fan."
5,A Voice that needs to be heard,"This book takes a radical view on the whole question of saving our natural environments. Turner argues that they are our wild nature, not to be controlled, managed, studied, recreated in. He talks about the 'fun hog' as the typical way we interact with the natural world. What we are losing is a deep part of ourselves, our soul, our sacredness, something ancient, where people once lived in nature, we now rarely even spend a few days.Jack Turner makes a passionate and personal argument for wildness (vs. wilderness). I loved this book. It spoke my thoughts in an eloquent way."
5,Wildly great book,"Well written, thought provoking book, full of adventure, passion, anger, and even rage. We need to heed his words and follow his actions but stepping, softly, into the wilds. It is too easy for man to step into ""wilderness"" and then start reshaping it into to his likeness, rather than to just ""be"" and to experience it as it to its fullest."
3,dark comedy,"It seemed like Dog Soldiers again with John Pertwee and a unit of juvanille offenders......"" come on lads grab your kits lets get moving "" ....he is always enjoyable bringing cockney brass to his roles. ( I swear if you met this man in a pub he is not that different ) Meanwhile the brash narrow-mindedness of most of the offenders ( or London block-heads ) keeps this film afloat on comedy ; juxtaposed by an un-seen-nasty.This film could have done with atmosphere. And and more complexity just by virtue of John Pertwee's maturity if he had been in it for longer."
4,Wildness in the wilderness!!,"Nice little outdoor slasher movie. It's about a buncha troublemaker teenagers forced into the wilderness to get them to bond. But all it really takes is a mass murderer to bring them together (well, most of them). Good flick to waste an hour and a half on."
3,Cpt. Strong,My heart just sank when Capt Strong was captured by the smugglers and poached in a vat of water like an enormous egg. A must see for all fans of Capt. Srong and smuggling operations!
3,An interesting form...,"I consider myself collector of baby name books and I found this one both confusing & interesting. It comes from the UK so those of us in the USA have an oppertunity to take a peek at popular names ""across the pond"". Unfortunetly, the names, while in alphabetical order, were not seperated into the standard ""Boy Names, Girl Names"". However, there is a great selection of names here. If you are looking for something a little diffrent this book may be a good place to start!"
2,Not much good...,"At a little under five bucks, the price is certainly attractive, but this thing won't hold much at all. Gave it two stars because you could possibly keep some earbuds and maybe a game and a memory card in it, but that's pushing it. Go ahead and spend a little more and get something that will carry what you need.Skip this, even if it is on sale."
5,"Great look, better sound!","These look and sound great attached to a 37 in dell flat panel TV. They are made for the TV, and look great. The sound is great as well- best range of sound from any Speakers for this price"
5,One of the gods of guitar speaks eloquently,"Except for a couple import hard to find albums, this marked guitarist Robben Fords 1979 debut. Here he serves notic that no prisoners will be taken. Simply put, this is one of the greatest jazz/fusion releases ever! Robben and band simmer and smoke, all the while playing from the heart. I would be hard pressed to name another guitar album where jazz and rock so wonderfully coexist. Only Larry Carltons 1977 debut self titled album comes to mind, Buy this cd immediately and you will not be sorry. If you like this, search out Buzz Feiten, Mike Landau, Dann Huff, Larry Carlton, and Tim Pierce."
5,It doesn't get any better than this.,"More so even than Larry Carlton, Robben Ford blazed the guitar trail with a unique style in the late 1970's which became known as the ""LA"" sound. It was true jazz fusion: Really complex and innovative harmonic ideas fused with rock and blues power. If you want to know where it started, listen to this album. Robben plays so well, that if you're a guitar player, you'll be heading to the woodshed, fast! And to top it off, you get some great blues (""North Carolina"") as well. This album is so good, I'd give it ten stars!"
4,Greatness,"Robben Ford's The Inside Story is a terrific album showcasing some of the best of early '80s LA fusion. His compositions are cinematic and funky at the same time. And, of course, his guitar playing is very unique. His style makes me think of Mike Bloomfield and Larry Carlton mixed together. BTW, you may notice that his line-up of backup musicians are the Yellowjackets before they were the Yellowjackets!"
5,Bought it when it first came out (l.pl) have searched since,"I agree with the other reviewer about a must on a desert isle; however, one must also note that this is the genesis of the band ""Yellowjackets"". I remember the first time I heard ""Magic Sam"" and still it is a favorite. This is a fantastic album, so fantastic that I would have bought a ticket to CA last summer just to see Russ Ferrante, Jimmy Haslip and Robben Ford onstage again in Pasadena, if I could have located a ticket to the show. Major talents!!"
5,Smile at Someone Today!,"A warm smile when you're feeling down works wonders. A little girl's friendly smile starts the pay-it-forward story of how a tiny act of kindness can work wonders throughout a community. Each character is affected by the actions of someone who has been influenced by someone else's small act, and the tale cycles back on itself in a satisfying way. My class of 1st and 2nd graders got the message loud and clear and have often referred back to One Smile when we have encountered similar situations in other books. Read the book and try smiling broadly at the next person you meet; it really works!"
1,Really boring and unpleasant!,"This collection of short stories was very disappointing. The stories were dull and the plots uninspiring.After reading a few of the stories, one becomes rather nauseated at the extreme political views and the lack of excitement. They seemed to be based upon the strong anti-Semitic feelings of the author. Racist and religious stereotypes were reinforced throughout the book. Kim seemed to run out of ideas towards the end of the book as each story became more and more repetitive and predictable.I was amazed at the poor standard of English in this book. I found sentences beginning with 'And', numerous typographical errors and words used out of context. I can only assume that English is not the native language of the author or the book was very poorly edited.Most readers will find the stories in this book very irritating and in some cases offensive (readers of Jewish faith)."
1,Absolutely awful!,"I found this to be one of the worst books I've ever read. The content was badly edited, assuming that it was edited and conveyed extremist political views. The author, Kim, used a lot of racial stereotypes and produced arguments that condoned or even supported anti-Semitic ideas. It seems to me that the author is one of the 'hardcore extremists' in the Evangelical Christian movement, who preaches that Jews must be fought at every opportunity.The stories were very boring and predictable. They were also very slow moving i.e. it took ages for anything exciting to develop. I think most readers will find this book both offensive and very dull."
1,Very crap,"I have been reading Kim's books out of curiosity because it amazes me that such poor literature gets published. This book 'Jewish And Indian And Other Stories' is absolutely abysmal. The stories contain a lot of anti-Semitic material, which could offend Jewish readers. There are lot of inaccurate stereotypes of various religions and the people, who follow them.Yet again another of Kim's books gets the vote of no confidence from me and I am sure that many other readers will agree."
5,The Fano plane game,"Mathematically, this is a Fano plane of Fano planes. For any two points, there is a unique third point that completes the line. Also, with three in a row, all other lines are blocked. Gorgeously made. One of the most beautiful games I own.The move mechanic is very clever. Basically, move your piece, then put an opponent's piece on the spot you left. Thus, you are always helping your adversary, to some extent.In a way, the game is as simple as tic-tac-toe, but it winds up being deeper than that.To win, get three in a row, three times."
1,Cheap and bad quality. Follow-up: bad service,"I bought this soymilk maker two months ago. Frankly, the price is pretty low compared with other brands. However, the quality sucks! The motor was broken just after a few days.After I sent it back, it took some time for them to repair it. Unfortunately, they sent it back to me without the power cord. They promised me to send the power cord two weeks ago, but it has never come yet:( I am still waiting...DON'T waste your time and money on it!Follow-up:Finally I got the power cord, but it died again just after 2 weeks. I contacted them again and they told me that their technician would call me back to solve the problem. But a few months passed, and I have never got any call from them. I've decided to give up and try other brand."
2,poor quality,"The motor quit after just 6 uses. Further, the quality of the milk it produced wasn't very good to begin with. I wouldn't recommend it, and I wish I could have it replaced. But I'm more likely going to try another brand..."
2,Just okay,"I feel bad about this, because it gets great reviews, but I wanted to offer a different perspective. When I read reviews, I check the good as well as the bad, and hopefully in this case I might help someone avoid purchasing something that might not be right for them. For me, this DVD was just okay. I'm not sure I'll do it again, which makes me sad because I hate to waste money, but there it is. I am pretty fit and when I purchase a DVD, I want it to either provide a really great challenge or, in the case of my other yoga and pilates, move my body and maybe not challenge me as much physically but also get the mind-body connection. This did neither. I was barely challenged, so it's not for someone who is very fit, and the set and music kind of grated on me. I wanted to love it, but didn't for those reasons."
2,Rather dull and no cardiac effect,"I really did not like this video. For one thing, the music was incredibly dull as was the set. For another thing, I felt no cardiac effect from the workout and I didn't get the post workout ""lift"" that I usually get after doing a workout. I think it is too easy. I would recommend Janis Saffell's Beverly Hills Pilates or Ellen Barrett'sCrunch - Fat Burning Pilatesvideo as much better options."
1,Not all Standing,I bought this DVD because it said it was STANDING Pilates. The 2nd routine that focuses on the lower body does have floor work. I would not have bought this DVD if I'd known that.
3,piggy costume,"this sure is a cute costume, but the head of the piggy or hood didn't fit my dog well,and he really didn't like wearing it either. The hood I don't think is made right for some reason,,,I think it would have fit better if we ordered the next size up from the recommended size"
4,Piggy outfit is fun for a few laughs,"My only gripe for this product is that the sizing isn't really clear. Buying small just results in a funnier effect, so it is really up to you."
3,Mixed cauldron,"Some times I think this album is totally brilliant but most often it sounds way too unfocused. If you want to get into the Liars new direction, start with the single ""There's Always Room on the Broom"" and if you like that, move on to this. But be sure to give it a lot of listens before putting it aside, it takes effort before it starts to sink in."
2,liars are royalty,"there are bands out there that all of us want to like- and we'll do so regardless of what they do. like the flaming lips. well the liars are also one of those bands. remember in cool hand luke when he couldnt finish his supper because he ate 50 hard-boiled eggs on a bet- then everyone came around and took bites of his supper for him until it was gone so he wouldnt have to go to the ""cooler""?thats whats going on with this album- everybodys trying to keep the liars out of the cooler. the record is an extravagant ""so what"" because it can afford to be- but im not worried, i like them no matter what."
2,Guitars? We don;t need no stinkin' guitars!,"The first Liars album ""They threw us..."" succeeded mainly because of the guitar driven beats. Not so on ""Drowned"". Kudos for the concept album, and to be sure, they have something, but a listenable something? Not really."
5,Much easier than I thought,"I have to admit that I was nervous about installing this product. I needed to replace the threads for two cylinder studs on an engine. I was worried about drilling the hole a little cockeyed and then the studs wouldn't line up. If I screwed it up I didn't have a ""plan B"". With all of my apprehension the first one took @ 45 minutes. After doing the first one, the second took about 10 minutes. It's much simpler than I had imagined it. Follow the directions and it works smoothly. One point though. When drilling the hole for the helicoil you need to make sure to take into account the taper on the drill bit tip. When screwing in the helicoil it will stop when it hits the taper. Make sure the hole is deep enough with the full diameter of the drill bit for the insert to go all the way in. It's really a very simple process that does an excellent job."
3,A Bit Tricky,"Surely forming the cup becomes easier with practice, but the first time through I was dependent on directions. Also, the cup is bulkier and larger than I thought from the description and I probably won't be tucking it into my handbag as first thought. Would be fine for backpacking!"
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed to see the product is only the replacement stones. The item description encompassed the honing tool. This is what I was after. A picture of the tool was also advertised. Very poor representation of the actual product. Now I will be shopping locally for the tool and will think twice about ordering anything else from this site. The only plus side is I now have replacement stones for my future tool purchase.- A Gearhead
3,"yes, but....","Japan Made in the U.S.A is generally a helpful response to some shallow journalism written in the U.S. However, there are too many instances where authors themselves leave out important points , which seems to strengthen their arguments yet instead simplifies them. I found myself saying ""yes, but..."" several times while reading ""Japan Made in U.S.A."""
5,Love!,"I opened this up and was so confused - I sniffed them and couldn't smell any flavor, even tentatively licked the Chocolate one to see if it was flavored. Nothing. I offered one to my dog and he started sniffing it intently then grabbed it out of my hand. He sat on the rug and chewed it with his tail wagging like crazy. My other dog loved them too. When I throw these for them to fetch they run as fast as they can to get them! They have never been so in love with tennis balls before. :)I don't understand what all the bad reviews are for, my dogs and I really like these."
2,Not great,Our dog tore these apart in seconds. She wasn't as enthusiastic about this as she is with regular tennis balls. I think we'll stick with regular ones.
2,meh,"I expected these to bounce but they fall flat to the ground like a wet rag. My dog popped all in less than 30 sec but he's 80 lb, my 30 lb dog play with it for a bit, her mouth cannot hold this size ball but I don't think she could have popped it, she's a beagle and very passive. They didn't last long with me"
2,Songs for Tranquility - None of songs are what they say,"I just purchased the Songs for Worship - Tranquility and none of the songs on the 2 cds are anywhere near what they say they are. The songs are nice but not what you would expect. In fact, the first cd shows it is ""All Creation Worships"" disc 1 and the second cd shows ""Holy Ground"" disc 1. For a $6.99 cd it's not worth the time or money to return the cd, but I am disappointed not to have received what I paid for."
5,A page turner. I loved it!,I found this novel to be very interesting. I loved every minute of it! Adreana's writing style is colorful and unique. I can't wait to read her next book.
1,Third rate,"Was this book edited? The writing is stilted and the plot is overwrought. The book is full of repetition, which was sadly mistaken for plot developement. Given this, the plot is everywhere but where it needs to be, and the characters are shallow and uninteresting."
1,Boring and Redundant,"Does the apple fall far from the tree? In this case - miles away. This book is full of boring and redundant metaphors and cliches. It reads like a work from a grade school creative writing class in bad need of editing. I am surprised the publisher let so much obvious inexperience slip through. Was the editor sleeping through the book as I did most of the time? Nothing new under the sun in reference to the plot or characters. It's all been done and said before by many authors, including her father, whom I'd read since ""A Stone for Danny Fisher"" and despite the the lack of popularity with the critics, he managed to tell a riveting story. This book comes no where close to doing that. If I could, I would have rated it 1/2 a star just because it managed to get published, for it lacks any literary merit."
2,What planet did 86 of these songs come from?,"Before you buy, take a few minutes to preview all of the songs in this set...maybe I was just asleep during the 80's, but I only recognized about 15 of these songs as ""hits""...the rest were leftovers that never really got much airtime on the radio. If you're looking for a radio replay experience, this isn't it."
2,Story Retold for the zillionth time,"And it's as wacky as ever. Premise - poor planet Earth has gone to the dogs and instead of fixing the problems we set out on a trip to another world to create another Eden. (These other solutions are always so astronomically more expensive that just fixing the problem that I wonder why people even try.) Forget what happened the first time with little Eve and stupid Adam, this is going to be different.But you know and I know that it's not different with violence, double crossing, mistaken identiry and rambling on about whether or not they're on another planet or say, Sumatra. In the end it's Earth but it's another Earth (Go Figure). Besides the narrator is knocked out and doesn't know if he's going to live or die. How apropos.The writing is strictly in science fiction mode (and you know what that mode is), pedantic, and to tell the truth the various characters fail to remain after a few minutes. Needs some more work."
4,J RICE,This is a book about Jerry Rice which was really awesome book.The things that were awesome was that they told us about his whole life from high school days and days in the pros.I recommend this book to a person who like football and like life stories of people.
5,Just get it,Like anybody in richy rich Dallas knows what they're talking about anyway. This a real album. Much bass for ya ear and plus it has alotta H-town underground all-stars. Better than his first album and hopefully they come out with the chopped and screwed album version soon.
4,all ways 2 praise,Definitely going into my worship library. So few arenas are exploring the use of all of the performing arts in singing His praises and enjoyable by whole family although it showcasing young people
4,Alive Video with John Tesh,"I was very impressed with this John Tesh video because it not only highlighted John's talent playing piano/keyboards, but there was great footage throughout the video of some artistic and talented dancers. It surely was up-beat and lively and the lighting effects in the video enhanced the whole program. I found it very entertaining and am in awe of such wonderfully talented people."
5,Do you like dance and music with faith thrown in?,"I love this DVD. High energy and just great music and dance. Bought over a year ago, now I'm watching ""Wake-Up"" by Gateway Ministries...Love Kari Jobe."
1,Great Photographs - Pity About the Text,"This guide to Iraq has some wonderful photographs, but the text is larded with anachronistic assertions and factual errors. For example, on page 11, Munier gives the dates for the Sumerian civilization as between 3500 to 2350 BCE, and then a few lines later says that the Sumerians had ""agricultural knowledge that produced an improved, iron plow"". That's pretty amazing, since the Iron Age and the smelting of iron in the region didn't begin for another 1100 years! It's the equivalent of saying that the MP3 player was introduced in the Middle Ages. Other absurdities abound, especially when Munier begins covering the more recent history of the country and his admiration for the former regime begins to show. If you want good photographs, it might be worth the money, but ignore the text: let's hope better guidebooks to Iraq are soon produced!"
3,Product description not quite right.,"Though the sorter I received is indeed nice, and may be worth keeping, it isn't what I read it would be. It's only about 7"" wide on its longest dimension, and though the description mentioned a drawer, I was going by the picture, which doesn't show one.It's big enough to sort bills that can be stored folded, but it's nowhere near big enough to hold a 8.5x11"" piece of paper."
2,Below average true crime book,"I'm really surprised by the high rating of this book. I think it was one of the least memorable of the true crime genre that I've ever read. Why? Because the victim and the killer were both so young and had not lived much of a life yet, that there was not much to say about either of them. I felt like I never got a good sense of them and that is important in this kind of book. The book also was very repetitive. Also, there really was no thrilling detective or legal work done here. The only realy evidence found was DNA evidence. And throwing the info in at the very end about Ken's other crimes was jarring. It may be good to surprise the jurors but don't surprise the readers with facts that should have been brought out earlier. Basically I had to force myself to finish this - it is nowhere in the same league as truly great true crime books like Helter Shelter, Fatal Vision, And the Sea Will Tell and The Stranger Beside Me."
4,you wont put it down,"YOU WONT PUT THIS ONE DOWN, IF YOU LOVE TRUE CRIME YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE. ITS ABOUT A NINETEEN YEAR OLD BOY, WHO VIOLENTLY KILLS A YOUNG TEENAGE GIRL, THAT HE HAD BEEN FRIENDS WITH HER AND HER FAMILY FOR MANY YEARS. HE HAS A HOUR BEFORE HE HAS TO BE HOME, SO HE DECIDES TO TAKE THE LONG WAY, AND HE MEETS UP SOMEHOW WITH CRYSTAL TODD . IT ALL STARTS FROM THERE. NOT TOO LONG AFTER, HER MUTILATED BODY IS FOUND. ALTHOUGH KEN REGISTER WAS WELL LIKED AND A CHURCHGOER, YOU FIND OUT THAT HE HAD A QUESTIONABLE PAST, THAT MIGHT LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE HE WAS A KILLER IN THE MAKING. IF NOT CONVICTED, I WONDER HOW MANY MORE WOULD OF FACED THE SAME HORROR CRYSTAL HAD. THANK GOODNESS FOR THE PERSISTANCE OF CRYSTALS MOTHER 'BONNIE FAYE' AND DETECTIVES DEDICATION TO SOLVE THIS HORRIBLE CRIME."
5,Terrific Story,"I first read Dale Hudson's Dance of Death, then purchase An Hour To Kill. Both books are superb. They both kept me spellbound and glued to my seat. My only criticism is that they weren't longer, as I read them far too quickly and was mad at myself for doing so. I look forward to reading his next book."
5,An hour to kill,This is a true crime book.It is complete with the top people and the investigation team you get a true look inside of the whole case.I would say everyone needs to read this book it is a littlegraphic but it is a 5 star book.I have never read a book that lays out the whole story like this one does.Also you don't want to put it down as you start reading it.
2,"an hour to kill: a true story of love,murder, and justice in","This book did not develop as I had hoped. There was very little background information on Ken Register,his family life,or what could have contributed to his hatred of women. Crystal Todd's life story was almost nil; other than she was a very loved daughter. I was a little offended that Ken's lawyers could not seem to use proper English in the court room. Why was it necessary to constantly use ""ain't""? Was that a reflection on the jury or the spectators? The book jacket claims 8 pages of photographs. My book had 8 pages, but only 4 pages of pictures. Four of my pages were blank! This was not an Ann Rule book. She is the master of true crime."
5,5 Stars to Hudson and Hills,"Wonderful book. Well researched and written. Ken Register was a good boy gone bad. My prayer is that somehow Bonnie Faye Todd will find peace and closure to this tragic day in ther life. Even though An Hour To Kill was a nightmare of a story, I liked the book a lot. I can't think of many books that I have read lately where once I started reading I could not put it down. After I finish this review, I am going to order their new book, A Reason To Live. I don't normally buy hardbacks, but Igotta have this book."
4,"Ken, A Wolf In Sheep's Skin","I got this book from a friend and read it in two days. What drew me to the story is the theme of the book that says people are not really what they seem to be. In this rural town, peace and quiet was lost when the Devil struck down one of their own by using an 'exemplary fine young boy.' I wouldn't consider the book a trademark, but the story it tells and how it was told makes for good reading. I don't regret picking this book up. It was a nice treat. Thanks Mr Hudson and Mr Hills for sharing this story."
3,Don't be fooled by 5-star reviews,"I bought this book based on all of the five-star reviews and the abject raves from other readers, and am I ever disappointed. It's a run-of-the-mill murder ""mystery"" that is solved fairly quickly, with an uninteresting departure of focusing on the wrong guy. The ""boy next door"" stabbed to death 17-year-old Crystal Faye Todd in a monstrous frenzy. But nobody is prepared to believe when DNA points to teen who has given comfort and a shoulder to lean on to Crystal's mother. The murderer's parents believe the police have done a ""frame job,"" and come across as almost comically ignorant. Get ready to read a lot of ""it weren't a good thing."" An Hour to Kill is a compelling read, but it cannot compare to classics in the ""true crime"" genre."
5,One of the best books I have read,"I recently had an opportunity to hear Dale Hudson,one of the author's, speak in Myrtle Beach. I was so fascinated with his talk that I bought a copy of the book from him when he finished. True Crime has not always been one of my favorite subjects, as murder, mayhem, and blood keeps me awake at night. However, this is unlike any true crime book I have ever read. It is intriguing and the story line pushes you from one page to the next so much so that you can't stop until you have read it all. What a sad, sad story about a teenager who couldn't control his sexual behavior and a community who couldn't believe he haddone it. Now we all know there are predators like Ken Register living in our small towns and waiting to strike upon innocent victims like Crystal Todd. My gratitude to the authors for writing this story. Every teenage girl should be required to read it."
5,You won't forget this one,"My very first True Crime read. I picked this book up on recommendation from a friend and absolutely could not put it down.Having never read a True Crime book before, I wasn't sure how I would like the story. This book overcame any hesitancy I might have felt. The writing was wonderful and fast paced, and this book is a page turner. I couldn't put it down.Probably more importantly, by the time I finished, I knew I would never forget Crystal Todd."
5,review of an hour to kill,"Great book! I enjoyed reading the facts of this case, written in such a ""page turner"" fashion. The insights into the character's heads was most helpful, as the story unfolds. I am a new fan to True Crime and this book certainly has me hooked. I'll be looking forward to more from these talented authors. Keep up the good writing!"
5,A Thriller,"An Hour To Kill is a well written and documented book. This is one of the best true crime books I have ever read, and I am looking forward to more books from Hudson and Hills. Not only is An Hour To Kill easy to read, but the authors do a splendid job in telling this story, plotting the events of the case, and developing the characters involved in the book. This book is such a page turner that I could not put it down until I had read every single word. I then wanted to go back and read it all over again. I did, however, find the events of this murder very disturbing, and my heart goes out to the mother of the victim, Bonnie Todd. How awful it must be for her to know that her daughter's killer was right there all along, comforting her through her grief. This is truly a Southern tragedy profiling a teenage sexual sadist, but even more disturbing is that a murder like this could happen to any of us at any time. An excellent book that I would recommend to all my friends."
5,TEN THUMBS UP.....This Book is Outstanding,"This book is excellently written. It keeps the readers attention throughout each chapter. The narrative discription of the area, characters, and the terrible murder will keep your mind wanting to read on and on. I have purchased several copies of this book for gifts. I am sure my friends will love it just as I have."
5,Spellbinding - Couldn't put it Down!,"An Hour to Kill has to rank as one of my favorite true crime books. It is extremely well written, and the pace of the book is superb. The book carries the reader along, urging one to continue reading as the story unfolds in a tantalizing fashion until the finally the reader finishes, exhausted from the intensity of the true story.Dale Hudson & Billy Hills manage to tell a story that is detailed, but not boring and reads much like a novel. I felt that I had gotten to know the victim and her family as well as the family of the perpetrator. The authors use detail about the area in which the crime occurred to supplement and enhance the story and the photo section also helps the reader to ""get to know"" the players.My one criticism is that I wish the book were longer! I wanted my reading experience to continue!Very enjoyable, and a remarkable first effort from the two authors."
5,A Must Read For Every True Crime Reader,"I can't help it, but after reading this book I think about Crystal Todd almost every day. Hudson and Hills did an excellent job of telling the story. I felt as if I was right there along with the police trying to figure out if Ken was the real killer, or not. I am convinced Ken did kill Crystal, but I am wondering if he has ever admitted to killing her? If he ever felt any remorse for what he did? If his parents and supporters ever changed their minds? I wish I could find an update on thesequestions. I even went to the author's website but didn't find it there. My prayer is that Bonnie Faye Todd will be able to get over the nightmare and horror Ken Register has put her through and live a normal life again."
3,works great for the high cap batteries,the portability is awesome and it works great for the 2200mAh batteries.it's a little irritating that it won't charge the 1100mAh battery that came with my psp (it won't seat properly) though.
3,This is not portable,"I recently ordered this unit because based on the reviews, I expected it to be the type with the fold-out plug rather than a long cord. I need this for travel, and I figured the other one available on Amazon would not be convenient because it requires a separate cord to plug it in. Well, unfortunately the charger I received WAS the type with the cord. It is thus very bulky and not at all convenient for travel. However it does charge the battery fine, so if you are planning to use it at home I'm sure you'll be happy."
1,Works on PSP-1000 Batteries only!,"I was misinformed about the exact product, I guess I just did not understand that it was for earlier model (This is for a PSP-1000 battery). With that said they are a great company it was shipped right away, and when I got the product and realized that it was not the right model, I emailed them they told me how to send it back and refunded me my money promptly. They were very courtious. I would do business with them agian.FYI- I rated one star because it is not a FUN game, and it is not a GAME overall!! :D"
5,faith,THIS SISTER TRULEY LOVES THE LORD NO ONE COULD PUT WORDS TOGETHER LIKE THIS WITH OUT WISDOM IN FAITH IN GOD EVERY TIME I WATCH THIS DVD IM IN CHURCH SHIRLEY CAESAR SURELEY HAVE BEEN CALLED TO DO GODS WORK.
2,Know what you're buying!,"NU TONES [Vinyl] [Single] is not what is being reviewed here, and the audio samples are not accurate.The reviews and samples are for the full album,""New Tones"",and it is a great album.This 12"" single, I'm sorry to say, is not very good.The remix ""Nu Tones (Matthew Dear Remix)"" is especially boring.You can find it on youtube, check it out yourself before you buy the vinyl."
3,Below review was for the total car care version of the manual,"This one is ok, but if you are gonna spend money, get the total care care one..."
3,"Origin, Vol. 1","Origin, Vol. 1~ The Soundtrack of Our Lives is a totally alright cd with decent lyrics, a rock sound that one has heard thousands of times before and a vibe that is definitely not new or ground breaking by any stretch of ones imagination. Then one might wonder why I give this cd in question three out five stars ? Well, the reason is that this album is just that o.k. and therefore deserves its 3 stars. The book-let is quite neat and the photos are shot in that ""olde"" national geographic way which is quite nice and being a huge fan of National Geographic I found this to be very witty indeed."
2,Proto-Who,"TSOOL's Origin 1 is a not-bad collection of proto-Who-type songs. Fans of Behind the Music will not be disappointed, but I wish they'd gone further into the psychedelic revivalism that spawned such stellar cuts as ""Sister Surround"" and ""Still Aging"". This time out there are more misses than hits, though ""Transcendental Suicide"" lights up the CD player every time, and ""Borderline"" is a solid anthem. I hope with Origin 2, they devolve in just the right ways."
4,In a word......awesome.,"Of the handful of bands I've recently come to enjoy, The Soundtrack Of Our Lives easily rises to the top. I saw them live last week and they totally blew me away. This album is matched only by their last one ""Behind The Music"". Both are amazing. I had to purchase this disc based on how hard they rocked when they played ""Big Time"", and how they seemed to strive to impress a relatively small crowd. That track has a great driving bassline, and is addictive all they way around. ""Believe I've Found"" is another great song, and the whole thing is fantastic. I highly suggest you see them, you buy this, and let them be the soundtrack of your life."
4,A must have album...,"Very catchy tunes that flow with ease. Noticed comparisons to early Floyd/The Beatles/The Who. Obvious British sound but was fooled when I found out they're actually Swedes. Nonetheless, this band gets it done. If your looking for music with excellent lyrics as well as rhythm, I highly recommend you check em' out."
4,Great Eclectic Retro/Brit pop,"I bought this CD on a whim, and I am glad that I did. It's a really eclectic collection of hooky retro/brit pop songs. Unlike the previous reviewer I think ""Midnight's Children"" and ""World Bank"" are two of the strongest songs on the record. I find some of the bigger rockers to be less inspired, but none of them are bad. Depending on your taste ymmv. ""Bigtime"", ""Heading for a Breakdown"", ""Lone Summer Dream"" and ""Borderline"" all also really stand out. If you like Blur or Supper Fury Animals then you should definately check this record out."
4,Superb Band Toiling in Relative Obscurity,"This is a superb disc from top to bottom...well-crafted contemporary Rock n' Roll which has been largely ignored by the music industry...how long can bands of this caliber continue to sustain themselves devoid of airplay? It's a sad state of affairs when TSOOL, and other tight acts, like the Libertines, Stereophonics, Alkaline Trio, etc. can't crack the airwaves while other talentless, music industry-created crap is jammed down our throats (use your imagination...insert poseur act of your choice here...). Origin I is a great disc...it seems the only way these guys and others like them will survive is through good reviews and aggressive word-of-mouth campaigns...enjoy the music."
5,Tour de force,"A tour de force. Spellbinding, relentless, with moments of rock perfection. Soundtrack of our Lives channel the rock gods of the 60s and early 70s and somehow make it all seem fresh, vivid. The musicianship is so tight, so masterful it is mind blowing."
2,pretty,"It is pretty music and I love Marc Cohn, but not your typical sing-along. somber on a lot of tracks."
3,"Excellent introduction, but lacks details or ""action steps""","Peter Keen's name grabbed my attention to this book. The book itself gets the credit for being the first to address the important but oft-ignored issue of trust in electronic commerce and e-business relationships. However, I found that the depth of discussion in this book was lacking (1) detail and (2) failed to provide any guidelines for how, as a manager, I could establish such ""realtionships of trust"" in my own company. The book does read like four different people wrote it and does not flow. There are some interesting ideas and examples, but I'd suggest you borrow it from the library first. Above average and recommended with slight reservations."
3,"can Pearl Jam ""SAVE ME"" from edited versions?","I'm not really sure why this cd single version of pearl jam's ""save you"" has been edited... it makes no sense. I've heard it plenty of times on the radio, NOT edited. I don't know who made the decision, but I'll tell you, one little offensive word is not going to kill anyone! Especially in the privacy of their own home! I mean its pearl jam, if you left the same word in the ""Jeremy"" single, then why not ""Save You""? It just makes listening to the song a bit awkward! And if you're not expected it, its even worse! Whoever, the b-side ""Other Side"" is quite nice; as compared to their other recent b-sides (Down/Undone) it's far better! I enjoyed that track very much; all in all, this single is worth having, but only for the b-side. Also, the artwork is very pretty cool! For a major pearl jam fan, this is essential, but everyone else don't break your back trying to get it! That's my advice. But enjoy!"
5,My first DVD purchase,"I am not really fond of Asian TV series but I decided to explore Korean and Taiwanese shows beginning last year. I watched the whole run of My Girlfriend is a Gumiho on Youtube and other streaming sites but still decided to buy the DVD set because I've fallen deeply in love with Miho and Dae Woong.Count me as one of those who hope and pray that there will be part 2 for this, still signing up Shin Min Ah and Lee Seung Gi.Thank you for making the DVD available, Amazon!"
5,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!,"This is one of those K-dramas that really gets you hooked and doesn't allow you to sleep because you want to find out what happens next. This isn't a ""silly"" supernatural drama, so don't let that stop you from watching it. It's very funny at the beginning, dramatic near the end, has a happy ending, and the music is some of the best of any drama. WATCH IT! I loved nearly all the characters, even the guy villain. This is one of my new favorites. Don't miss out on it!"
2,Doesn't hold up in severe conditions,Good water filter if you are going to be around non-silted water sources. I took it out on the Middle Fork Salmon on a self-support kayak trip during the spring when the water was muddy from all water sources. The new filter clogged within the first 5 gallons and the pump mechanism snapped. I'm planning to return it. I've used it in cleaner water conditions and it was fine...but was really let down that it failed me when the going got rough and I needed clean water.
2,Boring Grade B western with uncomfortable cast.,"Despite Mr. Maltin's high opinion, this is definitely a Grade B western, despite Claire Trevor's attempts to act as if it weren't. Albert Dekker is a boring Bat Masterson and Barry Sullivan his befuddled rival. Girlfriend shared - Trevor - tries to get Bat to give up his guns for journalism. Inexplicable Oscar nom for a mediocre score. Avoid this one unless you have insomnia."
4,Power and Interdependence (4th edition),"This is an exceptional book that introduces and thoroughly explains a new, at that time, international relations theory to understand our world order in the context of growing globalization. Complex interdependence introduces transnational organizations, non-state actors and multinational corporations as new actors to the world's stage. Their roles are significant in shaping economics and politics and will be included in all future decision-making. Joseph Nye and Robert Keohane are renowned experts in this field and their opinions inform leaders and scholars. The fourth edition brings the book, originally published in the 1970s, up to date and includes an insightful foreword by Fareed Zakaria and four prefaces by the authors. An excellent read!"
4,UPDated 11-19-Great for intended purpose... Conflicting package usage STATS-,"Front upper left corner says ""PICTURE & FRAME HANGING"" - back says DEF NOT .. testing as 'FABRIC TO PAINTED WALL AS anchors for bottom of drapes so heat from baseboard radiation register does not flow up behind the curtains and heat the windows.Updated: Ordered to anchor drapery bottoms to wall over a baseboard radiation to keep heat from floating up the back heating the windows. Had been using wide masking tape - these are hidden - Easy to apply - not worried about removal -"
3,Issues with coming off walls,"Some types (laminated, mostly) of posters do not stick well to this product. The product also can take paint with it when removed from walls. There are other products that do work with fewer issues."
4,"handy to keep pictures straight, and hang lighter objects","These are basically double-sided sticky foam pads. They do a good job hanging lighter things like a poster. I would not trust them to hang a framed picture. I have no proof that they would fail, but judging by how they tend to pull away and let go on things like wood and drywall (or anything that isn't 100% clean and smooth as glass), I wouldn't count on them to hold up a framed picture on their own.One great use for them is putting two of them behind the lower corners of a hung picture to keep it from wandering around or going crooked on its hanger."
1,Terrible Product,"You might as well just tear the corners off your posters right now and save some money by not buying this product. Yes they may hang reasonably well, but when you remove the strips, they tear posters. The best solution for hanging posters is always thumbtacks. They are much more low impact."
5,works,They works great to hang up posters. I'm not sure how well they will come off but I'll worry about that when the time comes..
5,works great; 48 in the pack,"There are 48 little stickers in this package. Each sticker has about 1/2""x1"" sticky surface. They work just like the Command stickers that have hooks, but no hook - you stick it directly to your poster, then the other side to the wall. Be sure you follow the directions and apply pressure for 30 seconds when you mount your posters. After fussing with double-sided foam stickers, and having things fall off the painted cinder-block walls on a regular basis, these seem to be working quite well. Nothing has fallen down yet!"
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to,"I've had the same experience as the other users with this product. I've used and trusted 3M products for most of my life, and was always curious about the mounting strips. I was leery that they would work as well as people say.But after mounting several very large, heavy posters (non-framed of course), I'm a believer. The strips went on easily. We followed the instructions and applied pressure in the correct spots for the amount of time suggested, and the posters are nice and solid on the wall. I have no doubt they'll stay up for a long, long time.I had to test the removability, though, since that's one of the major features of these strips. On one of the posters after a few days, I removed a strip following the instructions, and darned if it didn't come off just as advertised! Go 3M!If you have posters and want to make sure you don't damage your walls, these strips are definitely the way to go!"
2,Removal issues-possible damage to print,"I'm a big fan of 3M Command products. And while this product is vastly superior to the thumbtack or sticky putty methods of mounting, I can't recommend this for any ""valued"" artwork/posters. During removal, I've torn or wrinkled the corners of posters while pulling that tab---even with applying enough pressure against the print."
4,Worked just fine,"I used these strips to hang a poster a few days ago, and they worked just fine. For the most part, they were easy to use, though some measuring might be required if you are going to clean only the area of the wall where the strips will be affixed. That's because the directions call for the strips to be placed on the item to be hanged first, then affixed to the wall. So unless you want to guess about where those strips will line up, or just clean the whole area of the wall, you might need to measure. And I wondered if using rubbing alcohol to clean the wall, as advised, is safe for all kinds of paints. It didn't have an effect on the paint on my own wall. The packaging does caution about using these strips for valuable or irreplaceable items. For my poster job, they did the trick."
4,Good product,"I bought this mostly to hang large laminated posters on the wall. I needed to use 6 out of the 12 small strips on one poster. This cost is $3.99 here on Amazon and would've appreciated more strips per pack since they are only 6 left to use. On smaller children's art work, only 2 strips are required but still would have liked to see more strips p/package. Tip: make certain you keep the directions on how to remove them!"
4,"Does well enough on smooth surfaces, not as good on textured walls","As with most Command Adhesive products these strips work great on smooth surfaces but not so well on textured. For some reason my home builder saw fit to use this slightly textured drywall with tons of little pockets and crevices. Even with a satin finish paint, the Command Adhesive strips have a tough time getting a solid connection with the surface (even with the recommended minute of holding the strip under pressure). However since posters are pretty light in general they don't really suffer too much. Using the hooks and picture hangers resulted in a less than satisfactory feeling of security, but these poster strips worked fine since their load was lighter."
1,Epic Fail,"These things are just awful. I've already tried cheaper putty products - all of which did not work - and fully expected these strips to be the answer. But nothing at all can stay on my painted cinderblock walls. Once again, my dorm room remains undecorated because of bad products such as these."
3,"Command Strips Great for Poster ""Boards"", not standard Poster ""Paper""","I cut them so I could get 24 strips, used them to hand photos which are a bit more heavily weighted. I tried them on 140 lb art paper, 1/4 inch poster board and standard posters. They have a strong adhesive hold on all of the items. There was some minimum tear on the art paper when I tried to remove them, the poster board and photos held up pretty well when I removed the strips, but the standard poster paper I could not remove it without tear them completely off. Might be a bit to permanent for poster paper but I figured out a way around it. I hung the poster paper to the poster board with non-permanent scotch tape then use the command to hand the poster board, that way the poster paper would not get damaged. So for my work around, I gave it three stars for holding up the poster boards."
4,Good so far but,"If you want your posters to be really SECURE on the wall, don't follow the directions on the back of the product. You have to add more than just 4, on DECENT sized posters. 4 on the corners isn't going to give you flat-on-the-wall posters. adding 4 extra adhesives between those four would secure those bubble of spaces that are BOUND to come up a day after you mound the posters on the wall."
5,cool,"it works well, i have two posters that are really thick and these were able to keep them up on my wall. i also have these small metal signs about the size of a piece of paper but a thicker and didnt think they would work, but they were able to keep them up, a few weeks and no issues yet"
2,Only about half the strips worked,"I put up some posters in my room using these strips. While about half of them worked well, there were some that just did not stick no matter how many times I pressed them down again. All in all I would say this product is not very reliable, even though when the strips DO work, they work well."
5,"So far, so good","Works well on normal walls (with horribly cheap paint!) to hold up posters. The tabs come off cleanly after a month of use. Only time will tell if you can leave these tabs up for years. However, pulling them off the wall did not chip our notoriously delicate cheap paint, which is pretty impressive. There also was no grease left on the poster paper or wall, which has been my previous experience with similar products. No complaints!"
2,Doesn't live up to promises.,"These promise to work on all kinds of surfaces, but honestly, there are better products out there. It's really only good for the basics, lightweight stuff. It doesn't stick with heavier poster board and such.I'm going to find a better product."
2,"They work, but not for long","I've bought plenty of these over the years, but not quite sure why I continued. They will last up to a year, TOPS, before they eventually drop your posters off the wall. This couldn't be from humidity, since it's not that high in Southern California. They come off easily when you need them to."
3,"Sticky for Some Surfaces, not Concrete","These strips were supposed to be my solution for posters on concrete. They are not. While good for some surfaces, they just didn't work. I'll keep looking for something that works."
4,"Keeps posters up, and walls clean.","Command Adhesive has been continually improving, but I've never felt that it was quite ""there"". Sometimes marks would be left, or the pull strips would break, or the adhesive itself would give way.These poster strips appear to be the next step in the Command line's evolution. The strips stay when you want them to stay, and come off when you want them to. There wasn't any discoloration or peeling (even on a particular wall with paint in questionable condition), and the strips aren't nearly as thick as in previous generations.Having left the bedroom at my parents' house so riddled with thumbtack holes so many years ago, I know for sure that I'm going to get lots, and lots of these once my daughter grows in to her poster phase."
4,These are nothing new...,"but they DO work as advertised. They are simply the adhesive strips included with all Command hooks, minus the hook. You can use them to mount posters according to the packaging instructions or save some to use as replacement strips with the Command hooks you already own.Either way, they are useful and perform well."
1,Worst tape ever,I bought this tape for my movie posters and it did the exact opposite of what was said on the front of the package.- It would not hold up the posters. I used one strip for each corner.- It tore a hole in the poster when I tried to remove it.- It also took paint off the wall.I would not recommend this tape to any of my friends. And I doubt I'd even recommend it to my enemies
4,saves me making holes in the wall,I live in an apartment and I'd rather not be knocking holes in the wall and these do the trick. I have used them to hang up several posters and for that they work well.
5,I'm pleased with this product,"These revolutionary 3M-Command adhesive mounting strips are a great alternative to nails, screws, tacks or messy adhesives that damage walls. They hold on strongly and come off cleanly without leaving holes, marks, sticky residue or stains on the poster or wall. The stretch release technology works great on painted surfaces, wood and tile. There are twelve adhesive poster strips (1-3/4 x5/8in) per package.They are made in USA."
4,Certainly Sticky,"I used these on several projects, labling, fixing a picture frame and hanging a calendar. it worked fantastically on all of them. its double sided, one side special for the wall, and has a tab to make it easy to remove. Thanks 3M"
2,You can find better....,"At 35 minutes this is very slight budget collection that includes a few of Kristofferson's early hits, circa 70 / 71 (and one from '79) , but you won't have to try hard to come across a better collection of his work. I ended up with this for about a dollar and I probably over paid. Kristofferson deserves better."
4,"a lesson in courage,honesty and human yearning for survival","In The Last Trek,F.W de Klerk's treatment of his relationship with Nelson Mandela serves as an eye opener to all humanity.This places the book in a class of its own;honest,unequivocal,educative and deeply touching.In SPIRIT OF THE DEEP ,my new yet to be published book in celebration of Nelson Mandela and the South African people,I payed tribute to De klerk for having the huge courage to finally destroy the evil system of apartheid.The Last Trek gives us good insight into the very heart, mind and experience of this rainbow son of God.This moving book takes us on a journey of discovery into the courageous and no mean process of finally accepting the great wrong done to the South African people through apartheid.However you see the book ,The Last Trek ,is indeed,a lesson in courage,honesty and human yearning for survival and fulfilment."
4,Scheme - A Good Choice to Teach CS,"Scheme has been taught to every student taking computer 'science' at MIT for the past 20 years, and it is increasingly used throughout the world to teach that subject. The mainstream languages C++ and Visual Basic are considered to be poorly designed, and C is too low level to be a good choice in a course intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to computer science (which goes far beyond what the average person calls 'programming').Scheme is a variant of Lisp, which is the second oldest computer language, after Fortran. It is, however, a thoroughly modern language, and has strongly influenced the design of other modern languages like ML and Python.The book starts in Scheme, then adds object oriented techniques and assembly language. It finishes with a transition to Java, which is, of course, similar to C++. This approach will provide a much broader background than a typical text using C++ or C could."
3,Holy Moly!!,"I was very interested in buying this bible. There was so much hype about it, i.e., CBN, TBN, etc. Unfortunately, that's all this bible is. Hype. For money, I'm afraid. It doesn't even have a concordance. I'm very disappointed."
4,"Holy Bible, People's Parallel edition","Gerat bible. It's nice to have my 2 favourite versions side by side. However, I do wish that it had a concordance and also the alternate places in the bible where you can find similar verses. Overall, it is a very good investment. The NLT does an excellent job of puting the verses in an easy to read context, and having the two bibles in one helps me a lot during my bible study."
5,I am trying to find out if happyholler@webtv.net,I am trying to find out how this$20.99 Bible is boundIs there postage?is there tax?I need 2 if I can get this information
4,Parallel Edition Bible,"This is a very good way to have comparisons at hand, especially when doing a bible study or group discussion. My only suggestion would be to have the print a little larger. Thanks."
4,Good...,"Nice Bible. I really like the red lettering. Bible was in good shape, I just wish I had ordered the larger lettering. Otherwise, I'm satisified...Thank you"
4,know what your buying!,"you should always know what your buying. see i thought this was a brand new story with Barry allen in it so i got it right away, but it's a look back at his whole life as told by Iris his wife, and it's a lot of text with a few pictures on each page. BUT i did like it because i did not know a lot about Barry allen since he was long dead by the time i started ot read comic books but i always seen wally west talk about Barry so this was wonderful for fans who want to leanr all kinds of things about his life .just know what your buying."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"The device here is that this is a book, as written by the wife of The Flash. In this case, this is Barry Allen's incarnation of the scarlet speedster. This is not a standard adventure story, but basically a biography, colored by the emotions of the woman telling the story about her now dead husband. Nothing too exciting here."
3,I thought I knew who the Flash was,"Being a long standing Superman fan in recent years I branched out into JLA.This got me onto other characters so I decided to branch out...I only ever read the collected or Graphic novel editions so maybe I was missing big chunks of history.I got my Batman,Green Lantern collections up to date.then I thought time to start on Flash.Not cos I like him any less then the others but because he's harder to get hold of in the UK.I Knew Wally West had taken over from Barry Allen from refrences made in other stories etc so I thought..Hey this is a good place to start..Please dont make the same mistake I did.I expected a comic book but instead got a illustrated story book..this is a cash in book and nothing more in my opinion.Spend your money elsewhere.If you want a better read go for something like JLA year one..this is for those who only want to pad out there collection."
3,good history of the flash,this book is a nice adittion to any flash fans collection.it gives a brief background on everything flash.i liked the book but it was short and missing something.i though that having it written from iris person was intresting.the book gave a good history of the flash but could have been longer and gone into a little more detail on some things.
4,Bought for a friend,I have not listed to this CD but my friend called to tell me she was really enjoying singing along with Mac Davis to all the old tunes.
3,A French Story in French,My French has not progressed to the point where I can read this story but hope remains that it will be read and enjoyed.
1,Whooooo! Boy.....It Smells.,"Viewed: 3/12Rate: 23/12: As much as I like Mat Dillon, Golden Gate was a misfit for him. As a matter of fact, the whole film was that abysmally bad. Joan Chen could not act these days, but she did have something going with Matt Dillon. Probably the fault of the whole film should lay on the hands of either the scriptwriters or Bruno Kirby who managed to ruin every film that he appeared in. Thankfully, he didn't for This Is Spinal Tap, or he might have gotten one from the band members. Golden Gate seemed to be more of a ripoff from Year of the Dragon but not too much from Chinatown. Pretty often, they will mention the word ""Chinatown"" as if it was an ominous word. But let's get real, it's just a square of a block or two filled with a lot of bad Chinese restaurants and overtly red decorations. All in all, Matt Dillon does what he can do, but he should have done something else other than this Golden Gate turkey."
2,Passable film Nioir,"Although certainly not a great film, Golden Gate is a passable film Noir. Spanning 3 decades, this film follows the story of a rookie FBI agent who imprisons a Chinese laundryman during the Commuinism scare in 1952. Ten years later, he finds himself romantically involved with the daughter of the laundryman, as he tries to make amends for the tragic consequences of the false imprisonment.Matt Dillon and Joan Chen create a steamy romantic chemistry in this film. Although the ending is a bit weird, this is a passable film noir featuring some great panoramic views of San Francisco."
3,Ok but could have been better,"Even though T-Rock and Three 6 Mafia had some kind of fallin out, da long awaited Rock Solid album finally came out. It seems like another stupid rapper sold all his album rights to Three 6 Mafia, lol makes me laugh.Anyways, let me first start off by sayin that DJ Paul and Juicy J, while expandin their horizons as far as production, they lost dat underground edge that I used to love from them. Da production is aite but could have been a lot better. Thats where most of the albums flaws are.T-Rock is one of da better lyricists to record on Hypnotize Minds, and its evident throughout the whole cd, and guest spots by Gangsta Boo and Pastor Troy are definetly hot. I just can't get over da production tho, hopefully da new Three 6 Mafia Unbreakables will be nothin like this."
4,tight work,"look this cd was good because of the production that dj paul and juicy j got to offer, they're the kings of making tight beats. other rappers that have gone on their own after being with hypnotize have struggled beacause others have some wack production(if you dont believe me check out k-rock-k shock the world). t-rock is really talented maybe he'll get his deserved mike time and money. by the way da unbreakbles was tight work."
3,The album that should have came out a long time ago...,"This Is T-Rock album while he was still down with the three 6 mafia crew, SO THIS IS GOING TO BE TIGHT CUZ THE SUPA PRODUCERS JUICY J AND DJ PAUL ARE BEHIND THIS ONE SO IF YOU LIKE THREE 6 MAFIA, PROJECT PAT, LA CHAT, GANGSTA BOO, TEAR DA CLUB UP THUGS, HYPNOTIZE CAMP POSSE.........THEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS ALBUM, I was even shocked to see this one coming out..........SO ORDER IT WHILE YA CAN BEFORE IT IS SOLD OUT, CUZ T-ROCK IS THE WAS THE BEST ON THIS LABEL IN HIS PRIME.....................GET IT BUT BE WARNED THIS ALBUM IS NOT FINISHED IT WAS THROWN TOGETHER BY THA SUPA PRODUCERS CUZ T-ROCK LEFT SO SOME SONGS MIGHT BE SHORT but the production is tight as usual."
5,CUTE,This is the cutest poster ever! OMG IT IS SO CUTE! I wish that i could but it but i cant because of the shipping an the handling.
5,bonwire,brilliant...simply brilliant..unusual heavy rock/grunge ballad sounds from an enviromental lyrics group..
4,Excellent read,I found out about this book from reading war reporter Michael Yon's blog about a year ago. I really enjoyed this novel based on the historic battle of Thermpylae and the Spartans. The author obviously is well read on the subject and it shows in this book. If you're looking for a fun historical novel this is an excellent choice.
5,Great story and terrific evocation of characters,"I read this book after my son, who was a Marine officer at the time, recommended it to me when he returned from Iraq. A lot of the Marines read the book before and during the war. Steven Pressfield does an incredible job of creating memorable characters who come to life. He helps you feel what it must have been like to be part of a warrior society in ancient times."
5,every man must read this book,"After hearing about this book for a few years I decided to purchase it.The amazing mix of history and storytelling made it impossible to put down.Not only did I read it in record time but I also recommend that any ""man"" reads this book, especially in a world where true men are a dying breed.Much more historical reviews on here already so just wanted to add this:)"
5,The Battles Of the Ancients Come Alive!,"I literally blew through ""Gates of Fire"" by Steven Pressfield. It took me just three days and was just as good as I remembered it from the first time I read it.""Gates of Fire"" is about the Battle of Thermopylae that took place in 480 BCE. In 480 BCE, a hand-picked force of three hundred Spartan warriors along with their auxilia and allied forces (Numbered around 5,000 combatants) took on the nearly two million troops of the Persion despot, Xerxes the Great, and brought the advance of the despot to a stop for nearly a week valiantly sacrificing their lives in an action which saved the Peloponesse (Greater Greece) and very likely saved democracy and modern society as we know it. Pressfield's prose is very engaging and he manages to bring the battles of history alive in a way that endears the protagonist to his reader and makes the reader want to learn more.""Gates of Fire"" is a great book and I highly recommend it.Review by: Maximillian Ben-Hanan."
3,Good blend of history and fiction.,Gates of Fire is the tale of the heroic 300 Spartans who made their stand at Thermopylae through the eyes of a fictitious by-stander.This book is fairly engaging though many parts do drag and take some time and dedication to get through.If you're interested in Greek history and don't mind this not being a full blown history book it is definitely worth reading.
4,A good historic fiction read,"If you enjoy this time era and especially The Spartans, you will not go wrong with this book."
5,Great in many ways,"This book sets the standard for historical novels. Not only does it give a historical perspective of Greece from the eyes of the narrator, Xeones, but it also gives us a glimpse of the warrior spirit possessed by the Spartans. I especially like the fact that the story is told by someone outside of Spartan culture (a Helot from a nearby city-state). I think it lends more credibility to the narrator, and allows the reader more empathy. If the story were told from the perspective of a Spartan, many things may be taken for granted, or would sound strange being explained.Overall, this book is great for anyone who wants to learn more about Spartan and Greek history, anyone who likes a good battle story (it reminded me of many of Richard Marcinko's books), or anyone who wants to understand a warrior mindset."
4,Gates of Fire,This is an excellent depiction of the battle of Thermopylae. The author gives us a look at the friendships and honor each soldier has for one another. The characters in this book could be placed in any war at any time and their experinces would still be the same.I recomend this book to anyone interested in joining the military or anyone who is curious about battle and the men who fight.
5,Absolutely Moving,"Without a doubt, Gates of Fire was the best historical novel that I have ever had the chance to read and there have been many. The feeling of the Greeks courage and honor...and the tragedy that I knew would follow them was absolutely heart-provoking to me. Never have I felt more a part of the action than whilst reading THIS masterpiece by Pressfield. It took me three days to read it but that was only because I made myself put it down to prolong the experience!!!"
1,The book was delivered damaged. Embarrasing!,"I have never seen a delivery that was so damaged as this book was when i received it. It was nicked and perforated in several places.Don't buy from Amazon, that's my suggestion."
1,Student Review,"I read this book for my honors western civilization class. I'm in the 9th grade. Personally, I really did not like the book at all. I found it very confusing, especially with all the hard names. I thought it was hard to follow. But, I'd say it was a pretty accurate book. There's a lot of gory stuff as well, which I didn't care for, but those things do happen. I wouldn't recommend the book for a friend, but maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did; I hope that's the case!"
1,Gates of Stupidity,"Im in the ninth grade and I read this book in my world studies class and I seriously disliked this book. For one It was boring to me, it made no sense to me what so ever. It was so boring to me because to me it had no plot.Another reason I didn't like the book is because it made no sense to me. For one it had so many bigs names like Sphaireus. Another reason is because it went from one time to another like that.I would not recommend this book because to me it was a hard read. But if you like books like that go ahead and read it."
4,Epic is an Understatement,"I have read many so-called ""classics"" in my time in St. Louis Unveristy High School and I can pruely say that many of them come out to be very disappointing and overrated. In reading ""Gates of Fire"" in summer 2005, I clearly realized that I would never read a single novel as epic as Pressfield's work. Even though I am indeed a Tolkien fan and love his books, they sometimes hindered their approach to the main point and lingered on, what I believe, pointless jabber, explaining metaphors that would make the books less enjoyable at times. In ""Gates of Fire"", the metaphors and boring jabber is made up by the sheer detail given describing the battles and the character development, even if they are mostly fictional. I believe many who have rated this book poorly are just striving to be different and want attention for their actions. To you I move on and never look back.""Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here obedient to their laws we lie."""
2,Disapointing,"I found this book a serious disappointment, given the vast number of 5 star reviews. Mr Pressfield has taken one of the seminal moments in western history and trivialized it. Greek words appear as if he were testing his European ""your word power"", only to distract the reader. I'm not impressed with his style, which is certainly short of action or involvement for what is self described as an ""epic"". One leaves this book with little or any empathy for the characters; which the story cries out for; nor the general protagonists."
3,Valor Among Men,"You will feel as if you are there, panting and heaving, your comrade's taut flanks pressing with you towards the Persian line at the battle of Thermopyle. As a survivor of infantry combat, I can attest to this book's accurate portrayal of the closeness that only can form among men fighting other men in the Western tradition. You will feel as if you are there, gazing with admiration at the glistening supple loins of the Spartans as they do their morning gymnastics."
2,"Strangely popular, but only pretty good","I give this book only 2 stars because it has been widely overhyped for years. As an account of the famous Battle of Thermopylae, it is a serviceable adventure, written with a fair degree of descriptive skill, but it ain't Proust. On the downside, it perpetuates a lot of heroic cliches about the Spartans. So noble are these fellows, so full of vim and valor, you can't imagine why the helots would resent them so. A good indication of how distorted it is is the fact that modern Greeks love it--Pressfield has been made an honorary citizen of Sparta.I recommend instead Nicholas Nicastro's excellent ""Isle of Stone."" It is much more realistic about the true nature of Sparta, which was in fact the model for totalitarian systems throughout history. It is also written with more skill, with better rounded characters, and avoiding the stilted claptrap of Pressfield's dialog."
2,A bore,"While the various battle set pieces ring authentic and one really feels they are witnessing first hand the carnage of war, I found this book rather boring. There seems to be very little in terms of character development. Mr. Pressfield's characters seem to be mere stick figures pasted against the backdrop of historical events.The writing is also rather ponderous at times. There were several occasions where I needed to re-read a sentence to understand it's meaning - strange choices in word order, etc. The dialogue strikes me also as anachronistic.Overall, I just didn't care. My attention wandered. It's a shame because I've read such good things about this book. I found it neither compelling nor particularly exciting. But perhaps that's just me...For truly exciting and colorfully written historical fiction set in the ancient world (albeit centuries later than the events chronicled in this book), Colleen McCullogh's ""First Man in Rome"" series is about as good as it gets."
5,wake up to This,"Great book, I can state nothing here that other have not put to words better before me, so merely go out and buy this and read it straight away."
1,Propaganda only a Spartan could love,"I think it's high time that somebody wrote the truth about Sparta. Thanks mostly to writers like Pressfield, we somehow get the idea that these guys were basically ancient versions of ideal American combat buddies. Actually, the Spartans were possibly the least understandable of all the Greeks. Their society was a tyranny. They enslaved other Greeks. They mercilessly crushed democracies wherever they developed. What exactly do modern, freedom-loving Americans have to like about these guys?I recommend everyone go out and read some reputable non-fiction about Spartan society, not a whitewash like this."
1,Gates of fire,"Incredibly unreadable, the ""translation"" of the language into digusting modern adjectives leaves me bewildered who could possibly want to read it. It reminds me of those terrible American Marine films. After many tries I never got past the first 89 pages."
4,A culture's fight for survival,"This is a very fine tale of a society based on a pure moral and ethical code of honor. Men and women together intent on living by a higher physical, moral and spiritual standard. The book starts a bit slow, and the characters overall are not as deeply developed as Colleen McColluogh's are in her Roman series, but they are vivid enough. What blew me away about Pressfield's book was the final battle at Thermopylae.The writing is intense and touching, and the characters each come completely to life. He shows these men as fathers, husbands and sons who must become ultimate warriors when Sparta needs them most. He conveys the sense of what a battle in ancient times was like... the waiting, the fighting, the carnage. I really enjoyed this book."
5,Guaranteed to send shivers of admiration up your spine.,"Although I have read much involving ancient Greek history, I have never come across a work of historical fiction that did this subject justice. Until now. Pressfield takes you into the training camps and barracks of the Spartans, the greatest warriors who have ever lived. You feel what it must have been like to maintain yourself in absolutely peak fighting condition. The book explains how these men were taught to endure pain and keep fear under control. And Pressfield describes the battles the Spartans fought in a manner that brings home the horror and destruction that ensued when heavily armed phalanxes glittering with the sheen of burnished steel crashed together in mortal combat. His description of Spartan valor and discipline will send shivers of admiration up your spine. This is a man's book, and one you won't soon forget."
5,"Very well written, a great storytelling.","Pressfield tells the story of the battle of Thermopylae, where 300 Spartans held of 3 million Persians and rallied all Greece to eventual victory, with mellifluous writing style that enraptures the reader from first page. Told through the eyes of a fictional outsider, the reader learns what it was like to live in ancient Greece's city-state system and to be a Spartan. Why would men out of duty go to fight against tremendous odds knowing they will not return? What in that society would create the kind of discipline that the example of those 300 Spartans would rally and save all Greece? Read Gates of Fire and find out."
5,Go and tell the readers...,"This book is an excellent read. If you want to get a taste of what it must have been like training and fighting with the Spartans at Thermopylae, read this book. If you have ever served on active duty, this book will resonate across over 2,000 years of history and speak to you."
4,Very good,"This presents the runup to the battle, and the fighting itself, in a realistic manner with several strong created characters. You feel you have stepped back 2,000 years."
5,Great Story,I have read this book three times. Right after I finished reading this for the first time 300 came out and I went to the theater and left half way through. I was so disappointed in the movie because it could not hold a candle to this book. Pressfield walks you through this storied battle from a different perspective. Absolutely one of my top three books ... A MUST Read
2,Difficult and Unsatisfying!,"I found the prose of this book extremely difficult to follow because of the--overuse of greek words, unfamiliar English words, extremely complex sentences, unabsorbing narrative, too much talking about and not enough showing what your talking about, excess of technical details beyond a layman's interest, sacrifice of genuine suspense for seemingly endless explanations of military subject matter, and much more. By page 65 I trashed the book, worn out by all of the above."
1,"Interesting culture, too much pro-war propaganda.","I found the depiction of the Spartan culture to be interesting, though I can't say whether it was accurate or not. I did get really sick of the glorification of war throughout the novel. Any sympathy I might have had for the bravery of the defense of Thermopylae had long since evaporated after all the preceding rah-rah macho attitude about war. I wouldn't have minded if it were the *characters* who felt that killing was OK -- after all, this was a warrior culture -- but I felt that the author was really trying to proclaim that war is great, which really put me off.And, honestly, the story wasn't all that compelling. I didn't care much about the different characters, including the narrator, and I couldn't really keep them straight in my head."
1,Certainly not art.,"Someone bought this book for me because of my fascination with Spartan culture. I've always thought of the Spartans as little more than animals, personally, and think that out of all of Greece they seemed the furthest from being human in any real way. Pressfield practically worships these guys and it's obvious that your reading a book by someone who wants very badly to leave an impression on you, like a child telling you their favorite story. It's interesting in places, and the research is solid, but the story is forced and quite obviously not great art. I would only recomend this to either historical fiction buffs or people obsessed with this particular battle. If you want bad entertainment like this then go read 300 by Frank Miller, it's a comic version and not nearly this pretentious. If you want great art, look in literature."
1,Gates of FIre Review,"I am in the 9th grade and we had to read the book Gates of FIre. In this book there are 7 each individual tales about heroic warriors. Seven different books, seven different views. This book could be a really great book, but it isn't the kind of book I would read. I am not really into war books. This book I would mainly refer to guys from 9th grade and up. This book is graphic and goes isnto a lot of details. Bits and pieces of this book were pretty ok. I would recommend this book mainly for guys, although it would be pretty good for girls"
3,"Not too Bad, but not accurate","The book is well written but not accurate.The Spartan Life is not described accurately nor is the homosexuality of the Spartan Warriors dealt with in any real way. The Spartans great strength in battle was due to the pairing of ""love bonds"" between soldiers.This is not dealt with at all. It weakens the story.I had heard that this book is to be made into a film. I do hope that this inaccuracy is corrected.In our times of anti gay biases, we do well to see that gays are very capable soldiers (indeed, the best in history).If the Spartans had not died at Thermopylae, then Western Civilization would not have flowered.There would not have been Rome nor anything else. We would be speaking Persian now.Just a thought.."
5,Historical Repetition,Not the best written book on the incident but significant in the way the material has so many paralells in current events.My conclusion is that the nation that is unwilling to be militarily capablewill find itself like modern Greece...a wretched 'has bveen'....
5,"Deeply moving, indeed thrilling (despite anachronisms)","This book required some suspension of disbelief (nitpickers, some of whom have written reader reviews here can detail the problems). However--and this is a big 'however'--once the necessary suspension is accomplished, one is borne along by the narrative, the astonishing action, the internal logic of Spartan culture, and the characters. I found tears rolling down my cheeks as I read, so moved by the heroism (and I am a skeptic by nature). (My husband, who teaches Homeric literature, also read and was thrilled by the book, too.) I was amazed to find myself so thrilled and moved but there you go."
4,"Excellent atmosphere, some writing a little stale","This book is an excellent view of the world from the Spartan point of view, a refreshing change from the typical Athenian view of things. It explains the Spartan culture and societal organization, and places its narrator in a logical, reasonable spot for the narrative. There's probably a little too much of the narrator's own background, which has less to do with the battle of Thermopylae than is pretended, and this book could possible have been better written in the third-person. Among other things, it would have required less stretching to explain an omniscient view of the side of the battle in which everyone died. Given that you never really care much about the narrator, he gets in the way a lot. But the explanation of strategy and drama is fantastic, particularly if you are already predisposed to interest in the time period."
5,Very accurate account on the defense of Thermopylae,"Pressfield gives vivid descriptions of characters, and the brutality of Spartan warriors. This book was written as a personal account told by a Spartan slave to the Persians just after the battle. Although this was never told to the Persians(there were no Spartan survivors) it was still historicaly accurate, and a great book. If you want to learn more about Thermopylae, and don't want to get bored while you learn, this book is for you."
5,Great Book,"I read this one a few years ago and really enjoyed it. I think the comic strip ""The 300"" was based almost page for page on the book (minus artistic liberties...like people not seeming to be able to afford breast plates). The movie ""The 300"" is loosely based on the comic, so the author is the grand dad of the movie.If the movie got you stired up and curious as to what really happened at Thermopylae, and you don't just want to read dry list of facts, check out Gate of Fire. The author puts faces and humanity on the history. The book is a great read, historical fiction or otherwise.I don't give out many fives's, this one deserves five stars."
5,instant classic in the Homeric tradition,"Pressfield has done it! Beginning with an invocation to the Muses and ending with a story spent return of the battle's sole survivor to Hades, the reader is transported to the battlefield at Thermopylae. The reader will become so involved in the book that one's hair stands on the neck, muscles tense and the heart palpitates. When it was over, I was saddened. It's a definite re-read. My only dilemma.... I'm trying to figure out how I can use this in a graduate studies class for organizational behavior or leadership and have it be understood by those without a classical education!"
5,Best book I have ever read!,"I loved this book! I am a reader and have reads hundreds, if not thousands of books. My husband told me to read this book. I was not interested in reading a book about a war. But he insisted and I read it. I could not put it down. It was exciting, sad, happy and truthful. He painted a very good, accurate picture of the courage and fighting that these brave 300 Spartans went through. I highly recommend this book to anyone. Don't be fooled into thinking like I first did (A war book, boring!) because it is not what you would expect."
3,waiting for the movie rights,I enjoyed reading the novel but it seemed rather sloppy in some details and read more like a screenplay waiting to picked up for Hollywood. Of course that isn't all bad because a lot more people might go back and read more about ancient times.
3,"Not earth-shattering, but...","I've read this stuff before. Sven Hassel (in the days of my youth) wrote books about a group of German Army misfits fighting on the Russian Front in WWII. Hassel's descriptions of close-quarter combat are very similar to those described in Gates of Fire. Although Pressfield's research is good, I do wish that he would have omitted the part about the Spartan raid on Xerxes's camp. Rawlinson (the translator of Herodotus) seriously doubts whether this actually took place and attributes the incident to embellishment by Diodorus and, later, Justin and Aristides. If you've read Herodotus's History before you've read Gates of Fire, the latter is a let down. If not, be sure to read History afterwards."
