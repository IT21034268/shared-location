3,I dont know if the extra strenght is necessary?,"It fits on 3/32 cogs and chainrings, but the park mini chain tool(3/32) won't work on it. The easy snap chain link is a pain. It is easier to remove the chain with a chain breaker if you could find the right one for this chain. Overall a speciallity product that is more of a hassle than a benefit."
1,Received wrong item,"I ordered 6 chains. Was charged $6.69 for a package that weighed only 3 ounces. Did not even bother opening the package, since even one chain weighs more than 3 ounces, so I am guessing that I received 6 of the masterlinks. I could understand the wrong picture being posted with the item description and have seen it before. I order a considerable amount of bike parts mailorder and this is the first time that I have ever seen only the picture used and the item information and description ignored. I returned the item and received a refund of $7.44. Returning the item USPS First Class was just a little less than $4, so combined with the original $6.69 shipping, this fiasco cost me about $3. I guess this was one of those situation where I should have known that it was to good to be true, but either way there are plenty of other online stores that would not pass the cost of their screwup onto the customer."
4,Fantastic series but...,"I highly recommend this series, especially to lovers of English history or those who like family sagas. I was completely hooked after the first book and have been steadily making my way through the series. But this one was a bit disappointing. Too much time is spent in South Carolina during the Civil War for a book that is supposed to be covering English history as experienced by one family through the years. It would have been more in keeping with the theme if this book had covered how Civil War induced cotton shortages affected the cotton mills and workers in Manchester. But don't let this keep you from reading the series."
3,"Shreds paper well, but credit cards? That's another story.","I bought this paper shredder about four years ago for about $40.00. It stopped working altogether about a year and a half ago. I would normally shred no more than two sheets at a time. The paper would get jammed in it occasionally, though it wasn't anything major. The real problem was when I'd shred credit cards. The credit card would go through the slot very slowly and usually stop halfway through. The plastic would stay jammed inside the shredder gears and I would have to pick out the little pieces by hand in order for the credit card shredder to function again. Using the ""reverse"" switch, then forward (""auto"") again would sometimes get the plastic to come out easier, but usually it just complicated matters. Now the entire unit doesn't work anymore. I guess the gears are burned out.If you want a paper shredder that lasts, try a more expensive one. You get what you pay for."
2,"Seems to be well made, but that's about it","None of the kittens were interested, mamma kitty could have cared less, and the two 7-8 year olds didn't even turn their heads. We crinkled it and hid things under it, and still they all ignored it. I kept it, thinking that as the kittens got older they'd get interested, but it never happened."
2,not for my cat,"simply my cat ignore thisI thought it was something special, because 5 people gave 5 starsbut It was just cat nip mat ..nothing special and he've never played with it"
3,Need more facts....not sugar pill remedies,"This book does a good job of putting us all at ease that by letting us know we are not alone and that IBS can be controlled with diet. The advice about changing diet is good but too extreme. Most people will not need to go to the extreme diet elimination that the author suggests. Unfortuntately, the advice on medications and dietary supplements is based for the most part on annectodal experience rather than scientific evidence. While the author has her IBS under control...most people will be able to get their IBS under control with a less drastic measures ie. elminating alcohol, soft drinks, high fat foods and dairy. It is unlikely that most people will need to follow the authors footsteps and take peppermint tea 4 times a day, high dose calcium three times a day, and metamucil 3 times a day to become regular. In fact many of these unproven nutritional supplemnts can have adverse long term health effects and should only be tried with medical supervision"
4,Well writen guide,The book is pretty much as the title describes. A step by step guide on learning the aspects and how to control IBS
1,Cannot recommend,"I cannot recommend this book. The author's dietary suggestions are contrary to what you should do for IBS. I tried them anyhow. I was desperate. I got worse. I also gained a lot of weight in a very short period of time, due the the recommendations of all the starchy carbs. Talk to your doctor, find a good anti-inflammatory diet, and get on it. Take medication if you need to. Personally, I have found a strict Paleo diet to be helpful. It works so well that I hardly ever need medication. Every now and then you are bound to slip up, either accidentally or just because you give into a severe craving. When that happens, I need meds to get me back on track. I have tried the supplements that this woman sells on her website and they do not help. When I stick to my diet, I don't need any help. When I need help, there are good meds out there for IBS."
5,Everything I Ever Needed to Know...,"...I learned from my gastroenterologist! As the third in a long line of those who suffered from what my grandmother used to call ""the screamin' itch"", it's a tremendous relief to finally be able to both name and treat this affliction. Only recently diagnosed, I spent most of my earlier years wondering why nobody else in my class looked like that were trying to smuggle a Rubik's cube. What the heck did I eat last night, a Chinese Throwing Star? It got to the point where I was looking for a milder variety of oatmeal.Unfortunately, the diagnosis does little to help my superiors at the pepper plant understand my (seemingly quite understandable) lack of enthusiasm for my job in Quality Assurance; but once a pepper-taster, always a pepper-taster.Top notch book, beautiful diagrams!"
2,Not Great,"This book did very little for me. I found a better book called ""Tell me what to eat If I have Irritable Bowl Syndrome by Elaine Magee."
3,A guide for Irritable Bowel Syndrome,People with IBS will benefit heavily from this book. This could be their bible for IBS. Especially the section where the author tells you what you can eat when you cannot eat anything. If you have severe pain and diarrhea then a diet consisting refined starch and pureed vegetables may work wonders for you. Eating fibre rich food will help you if you have constipation. This book will give a lot of information for the normal person also.By giving up my coffee habit I realized having that wired up feeling all day clouded my concentration. Did you know one cup of joe raises your blood pressure by 14%! Fortunately for me I was able to find a wonderful tasting replacement made from soyabeans. You brew like coffee and it even helps lower my cholesterol. I found it online at www.S o y c o f f e e.c o m. Gaining this understanding will effect every move you make from this point on and will bring with it the necessity to share it.
2,Take 6 Fibercon and send me a check in the morning instead!,"If IBS causes you SEVERE pain and diarrhea, perhaps this book's radical diet (basically: refined starch and pureed vegetables) may work. But if you have the constipation-variant of IBS, your condition is merely an afterthought in the book. Upping the dosage and regularity of Fibercon consumption helped, but the notion that sufferers would avoid all high fiber foods seems absurd."
3,Needs Clarification,"I found this book, as well as the authors other work on the subject (Eating for IBS), full of useful information. However, I feel a better distinction between the two types of IBS should have been made when recommending dietary guidelines. Some of the recommendations, such as snacking on sour dough bread, will actually aggravate the constipation dominant form of IBS.I also found several contradictions between the author's soluble/insoluble fiber content recommendations and several other sources listing the soluble/insoluble fiber content of various foods.Overall, I would say this book would be a good reference to be used with other sources for anyone suffering from diarrhea dominant IBS."
5,The Author Knows Exactly What She is Talking About,"I have a very severe case of IBS and I followed the guidelines exactly as they were written, I have not had an attack in three weeks yet so far. I have reduced my medication from six pills a day to one a day. The physician said that I will probably never have to take them again, (I heard that the antispasmatic pills are hard on your liver in the long term) so this is great news for me to not have to take them anymore. I have also lost a lot of weight. This book has helped me the most by the nutritional guidelines you follow. The book is written so well and very easy to follow. To learn the difference between soluble fiber and insoluble fiber was the key for me. You have to remember this is a life style change, don't look back, you will feel great if you follow this book."
2,buy it used not worth the money,"Sammy and Lorrie both have wonderful voices, however this Cd is not worth the money. I seen Sammy in concert and went right to the store for this CD well little did I know the best song on it is SUGAR. ( Sammy solo)It is clear why you don't hear songs from it played on radio stations. Save your money and wait for Sammy's new release in the spring of 2002. Anyone want to buy mine??"
5,compelling story,"anyone interested in the history of basketball (or of the little towns in the Jackson Purchase region of Kentucky) will enjoy this history of ""David: slaying ""Goliath""."
4,This book did not have all of the true facts.,"My great grandfather J.B. Story was the coach of the Cuba Kentucky baketball team. I never got to meet him, but I did meet his wife my great grandmother and it said that Mary lee had blonde hair as a child and that she had blue eyes. But she didn't. My dad also read this book and said that the author of this book got her information mixed up so I think the next time she writes a book that she should get her facts straight. I am not mad but I just want to let her know about her mistakes."
5,SAMMY IS THE MAN,"yo sam its dan...the kid you always see at the exxon...your new CD is awesome man, every one who reads this should go out and buy it...good luck i hope you make a lot of money.. and get alotta girls...yea so i think youll do great man...peace"
5,Very Sexy!!!,"This is a very flattering shoe! They give the appearence of a pettite foot. they do run a little small so, I would recommend going up half a size. Other than that they are perfect!!"
4,RUNS SMALL!!,"THE SHOE IS FINE, CUTE BUT NOTE IT HAS A HIGH ARCH TO IT AND THE HEEL IS HIGH SO THESE AREN'T WALKING SHOES. THEY ARE THE KIND THAT LOOK GREAT BUT WILL KILL YOUR FEET.ALSO I AM A SIZE 5 AND THESE ARE SUPER TIGHT ON ME. I AM RE-ORDERING IN A 6."
3,Good Yarn,Varley is an outstanding writer. Not as much as a 'Superman' writer like Heinlein but similar in style.
5,An amazing read! Buy it now!,"Where She Went shines in part because the subject is so expertly handled in a genre ( the mother-daughter story) that often falls back on stereotypes. Its rare when you find a novel that is true and a pleasure to read. Where She Went, is even a bigger treat -- it spans the lives of two women - a mother and a daughter, but it is never sappy and the story is always original. It unravels the intricacies of their lives and their problems -- seeing each woman as a person even while they are seeing each other in the roles their families have prescribed. The insight and clarity into this family is neither hokey nor predictable. A totally great read. I loved this book and highly recommend it."
4,A very compelling well-written collection of stories,"The main characters of Walbert's book are colorful, refreshing and very imaginable. A continuous flow of descriptive metaphors keeps the reader yearning for more. I very much enjoyed her carefully woven stories of Marion, intertwined with both humor and sadness- a combination that captures Walbert's sensitive thoughtful style of writing. She is a very talented writer. I'm looking forward to reading her next book!"
1,Chasm . . . Throw This Off A Cliff,"Ryuichi Sakamoto's credibility is on the precipice with Chasm, a turgid unlistenable work of crud. Check out Coro and Only Love Can Conquer Hate, both sound like factory machinery at work. Dire, dreadful and diabolical. Stop being the artiste Ryuichi and have a go at entertaining. Your fans deserve better!"
2,Not that great!!,"There has to be something better out there. One thing that I didn't like was the explanation of the guy hidding behind the tree, and once spotted rolls to his right to avoid being shot. Oh those questionable ninji skills. I'd light the forest on fire with semi-automic fire. Took some material, and would leave the rest. A lot of the rest."
5,Can't Beat This,"I lucked up on this one. I found it just by searching and listening to various artists. Every song is a blast. The info booklet introduced me to this amazing singer. The songs are fun to listen to and sing along with. If you are not in a good mood sitting down with this CD will soothe your soul and make you happy, and after being stung by a few CD's, which I have purchased, this one made up for them all. Buy it and have a blast, you will not be sorry."
1,Doesn't work -- but a good idea,"I bought two of these for use at my mom's house in another state to prevent me from lugging our regular seats on the plane, etc. Seemed like such a great idea for short-term, occassional use! However, in practice, my daughter (4.5yrs and scrapping the top of the weight allowance) found the straps too tight (with no extra to let out) and the shoulder straps too close together, causing irritation to her neck (and she's rather on the skinny side). My son (2.5yrs and smack in the middle of weight allowance) could wiggle all over the place even when buckled into the center backseat belt - literally lying down on the back seat while buckled!Wish someone would make a similar thing that actually worked!"
2,Not too impressed,"Good concept, but not that easy to use. I actually left it on the airplane on purpose. It was light and portable, but was difficult to secure in a safe position."
5,A charming retelling of Cinderella,"This book, though rather juvenile in appearance, is pure magic. Shirley Rousseau Murphy is adept at creating sympathetic characters with a few, well-placed descriptions. Thursey is a spirited and intelligent Cinderella who enjoys defying her greedy stepmother and hideous stepsisters who use her as a slave for their inn. Loving stories and fairy tales of all sorts, her own begins when she meets a kind goat boy named Gilly returning with the queen and prince after the war. But is he really who he seems? And though he partly plays the role of the beneficial fairy, it's ultimately up to Thursey to make her own magic come true.Simply and beautifully told, Silver Woven in My Hair was one of my first fairy tale retellings (along with Beauty by Robin McKinley) and remains one of my favorites. A pleasant companion to the equally excellent Ella Enchanted, this book is definitely worth the effort it will take to find."
5,Changed my life...,"That may be an odd thing to say, but it's actually true. When I was in 4th grade (needless to say, many years ago) I read this book and fell in love with it and with reading. I remember being riveted by the characters. It taught me about empathy, somehow. I've never looked back. Books are what get me through long plane rides (and short ones for that matter!), childhood family fights, long days on the beach in SoCal, and any number of moments throughout my life. Books- fiction mainly- are a constant in my life. And I owe it to this book!"
3,Disappointed,"I have been a great fan of early Paul Whiteman...esp with Bing & The Rhythm Boys along with Bix, but this seems like a left over bunch of tracks not up to normal standards for the band."
3,"""Bullrun Presents: L.A. to Miami - Cops, Cars and Superstars"" is really a good week-end DVD.","I got This DVD maybe 1 month ago. It's rally Great, The Picture is so clear and vivid, the sound is perfect although I didn't like the ""host's"" voice. The DVD costs $11 I imagine, and though it's quite higher you have to consider it's a recent production(2007). All in all this DVD is great and I will not hesitate to recommend it to any body."
5,great product!,"These ""cheater"" chopsticks are a wonderful and fun way to get children started. Also helpful for individuals with eye-hand coordination challenges."
3,Too lightweight,"One end is great for dressing. The ""small"" hook is too big to pull up zips so it's no use for helping with shoes. This is a dowel rod with an attachment on each end. With less that 5 uses, the hook attachment came off on one end. Not sturdy for frequent use."
4,Great for the money,"Overall a good value. They are designed in Europe but produced in China. The eyecups twist out and are very convienient. The dioptor adjustment is on the right eyepiece and is a ring and not easily bumped out of focus like many models that let you turn the entire eyepiece. They offer a surprisingly good picture at this price point. Better than the equivalent Steiner's in my opinion with more user friendly features. They are fairly light due to the polycarbonate body, but still feel subtantial, you get what you pay for with optics but these are an excellent choice, the best I've seen at this price point. $349 at the time of this review."
5,"Smart, Fun and Thought-Provoking","This book is great for anyone who has ever thought before.It combines fun anecdotes, lessons about adjusting your thinking (that don't necessarliy hit you till hours later), and optimizing your brain power. It taught me a lot about how to get through the day at work and in life in a more efficient, productive and objective manner.I really liked it - and still like thinking about it. I need to read it again!"
5,grateful,"I love it .... first I see a 1 star review, then I scroll down tosee a 5 star review. There is no argument in matters of taste. This music may not be for everyone, but those who it IS for are grateful indeed. Dollison is a unique musician with a fresh sense of harmonyand great concept of how to use the voice .... upfront or in the background. The CD's brief opener, melting into ""Autumn in New York"" floored me. Ben Monder, Ted Poor and Matt Clohesy are perfect - supportive and inspiring."
1,if you have allergies be careful,"Not completely hypoallergenic. Caused severe irritation, red marks and burning skin. Even after it had been removed for several days."
1,Invalid Basis for Recommendations,"The work offers a code of best practices for the in-service inspection (ISI) of structures which function under mechanical stress. Thus, the question arises of how the authors know what is best. What is best in diagnostic instrumentation is what is most reliable.Conventionally, the reliability of a diagnostic instrument is determined by measuring its false negative and false positive error probabilities. However, this mechanism is not available in this case, for ISI violates an axiom of probability theory (see ""Erratic Measure,"" in NDE for the Energy Industry 1995. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, New York, NY.) Then how do the authors know the reliability?This reviewer gathers that, when ISI was developed, its developers assumed probability theory. With this assumption false, the work's recommendations are invalidated."
4,Quite good. Shame it is out of pring,"it's a fine old book, a classic, highly recommended by many. I am simply amazed that it hasn't been re-published by SOMEBODY. The prices for used copies are indefensible, I think."
3,OK - But Pricey,"This is a large book- and the explanations on the HP are clear, but much of the information does not address the capability of the HP-12C. Instead it is a 101 course in appraising, mortgage loan qualification, etc. In my opinion these sections do not really add to the value of the book, because if you are in one of these fields the information is too basic and limited, if not in the field other sources are more complete. In addition it really does not throughly cover all of the capabilities of the HP-12C, only those it considers real estate related.I think the manual provided with the HP is excellent and if you want another view I suggest the ""The Easy Course in Using the HP-12C"". It is $$ cheaper and solely devoted to the HP and its various functions."
2,This net only lasted a few months (with light use),I also had this net for only a few months before the material became shredded (with relatively light use and a normal basketball) and white dust particles fell in peoples' eyes. The net is in a spot that gets a lot of sun -- maybe that had something to do with it. I am about to replace it and will get a different net.
2,Didn't last,This net only lasted a few months before becoming weathered enough to tear. When making a shot there would be lots of white dust stuff falling down because the material was coming apart all around.
4,Great toy!,My two nieces liked this toy so much they fight over who gets to play with it all the time. My only regret is not having bought 2 of them while they were on sale...
4,Excellent book on Theology and truth of Christianity!,"I wanted to write a short review of this very good book by the new Pope. I am a Protestant Christian, but I have benefitted much from some Catholic Scholars. Ratzinger, being one of them. I think his book on Escatology, written in the late 70's, is one of the best on the subject. This book is top notch as well. He is a very pursuasive thinker, in my opinion, and his grasp of the Philosophy of Religion, is better than most. The book is pretty academic at times, but I found that I could not put it down. He knows what the heart of the Christian Revelation is, and is confident it the truth of it. I recommend the book. I think he will be a good pope. Thats my prayer anyways. Rick Woodhouse Bradford PA USA"
4,Remarkable,"Lucifer's Halo is the remarkable story of one man's spiritual battle with religion. Michael Joseph Lisner's striking art, incomparable symbolism and dialogue, provocative enough to startle, enhance the epic. Darrian Ashoka lives in a surrealistic New York City where the lower class is left to its plundering and filth by an elitist church who have moved to the city's outskirts. During a weekly Saturday night riot, Darrian is approached by Dawn, an enigmatic feminine deity, who invades his bed and provokes his intellect. On their next meeting, Dawn gives him Lucifer's Halo, remaining from his days as an angel. It is a dangerous bridge between Heaven and Hell and Darrian soon finds himself hounded by both sides in a bid for it. Darrian's fight to keep his gift is one of fright, confusion and reckoning. He must overcome fear and anger towards the other side and look deeply into his human soul for strength, truth and the right choice."
5,Shaking the Roots,"Step into the life of Bruce Scott and find yourself stepping into your own. If you choose you can put into practice a step by step guide to being real in all relationships beginning with yourself. The reader learns what being real looks like, and when applied to the self what it feels like. Through storytelling and personal disclosure, Bruce demonstrates how one can be both gentle with themselves while taking themselves seriously, and decide moment to moment how to act from inside rather than from how we're ""supposed"" to act or be in the world."
5,Sent chills down my spine!,"Amazing follow up! On tracks like ""The Uruk-Hai"" the fellowship theme is amazingly returned, and effortlessly changes to the Rohan theme, and the clash of brass as the Mordor orcs and Isengard Uruk-Hai themes clash over supremessy. The Rohan theme is chilling with it;s fiddle work and noble elagence. The ""The Breath of Lifes"" militarized version of the Lothlorien theme gets the pulse pumping! And the weird and wonderful Treebeard them relly capture the caracture! All the vocals are just great! Emiliana Torrini's ""Gollum's Song"" sounds stunning and I'm goning ot have to look into her CD's. A must have, and it will probly be liked better once you see the film."
5,Howard Shore's work gets even better in The Two Towers,"I'll keep this short. The Two Towers Soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks ever made. Almost every song is both powerful and memorable, a trait which many of today's soundtracks are lacking. I've been listening to this soundtrack for over a month, and I haven't gotten tired of any of the songs. This is the kind of thing you can put on repeat and listen to for hours and hours. Buy this wonderful new soundtrack from the talented Howard Shore right away!"
4,AWESOME!!!!!!!!,"Different from the FOTR soundtrack, the TTT one explores the world of men. The Rohan Theme gives a show of Tolkien, Peter Jackson AND Howard Shore's vision of the world of men: a bit like the middle-ages, different from the purity and perfection of the angelic Elvish chorus. It perfectly expresses what the men of Middle Earth represent, the unperfect but still noble, loyal and strong...true warriors of Middle Earth. Though most of the CD is about humans a touch of Elvish is added for when Haldir comes in. And Gollum's Song is sooooo sad...so...so Gollum!"
3,"Good, but be carefull","This is an excelent soundtrack, adding the Celtic themes of Rohan to the fabric established in The Fellowship of the Ring Soundtrack..On a downside from the excelent score the ""enhanced content"" is not actually on the CD, and copy protection interferes with playback on a home computer."
5,Absolutely Amazing!!!...,"All i have to say about this album is BUY IT!!! I'm not even a fan of the classical type of music, but when i listened to this cd, i got goosebumps....my favorites would have to be #8, #11, #15, and #16. The music goes along perfectly with the movie, which u should go see if u havent already!! (i saw it 4 times, and i could see it again) So to wrap it up, buy this cd, and i guarentee you will be pleased!! ..."
4,Very Enlightening,"I found this book very enlightening. I am an Air Force brat, female, and never really studied the life of a pilot. This book made me think about all my father went through to become a pilot, even though that's not what he made his career as... I was fortunate enough to meet Shane's good friend Eric while vacationing in WA. over New Years, and can tell you, if the book makes you think he's a wonderful person, his friends make you think even more so.God Bless America, and the men and women like Shane and my father who protect it."
4,A must read,An awesome book for anyone who has ever had any interest in Naval Aviation. A story of courage and heroism. Very easy to understand and a great short read.
1,poor front cover condition,"The contents of the books is outanding. Shane's writing style is excellent. However, the book cover was in poor condition. The top of the front cover appeared like an animal had chewed on it, and it was slightly soiled in that spot. I had ordered this book to give to my brother for Christmas, and it looked so bad, that I wouldn't give it to anyone! I sent it back to the distributor!"
3,Good book but can get boring.,"""Born to fly"" is somewhat of a life-story of Shane Osborn and his journey to becoming a Navy Pilot. Now I usually enjoy biographies of peoples' lives but this one did not fascinate me nearly as much. Much of the book was Mr. Osborn describing how a plane works and how he was taught to fly a plane. For me, I usually read books for pleasure, not for a lesson on the controls in an airplane.Near the end of the book when Shane Osborn and his airplane crew collide with a Chinese fighter and have to land on a Chinese airport, the book becomes more interesting.The whole story is very impressive and heroic, but at times can just feel somewhat boring. If you are considering a career in the military, ecspecially as a naval avaitor, this might be your book because it describes the long process to get there."
3,A great story but a questionable book,"A family member got the book for me as a gift, and upon seeing the front cover of the book, something immediately just said ""generic"". However, that being said, I would actually recommend the book to someone who isn't intimately familiar with flying or the military. Despite the skittish storyline, it's actually a quite readable and inspirational book that will likely invoke a bit of patriotism.Nevertheless, I think some people, especially professional aviators, might find it hard to like this book, even if they want to. To me, every page seemed to be written with the intent of someday being read in front of a camera for a bad made for TV movie...but maybe I'm just being overly critical. The story, in and of itself, is a great one (although covered almost in its entirety in the news), but I thought the literary qualities of ""Born to Fly"" just left much to be desired."
1,Self serving traitor to our country,"LT Osborne failed to follow established Navy protocols when intelligence aircraft are crippled in flight. Intel Naval aviators are instructed to ditch their aircraft in the sea to prevent the adversary from recovering the Top Secret equipment aboard. Instead of ditching after regaining control of the aircraft he flies 20 additional miles to make a safe landing on the adversaries military airfield. The Navy under the pressure of the American public could not court marshal him instead they awarded him the DFC however in a move behind the scenes he was quietly ""forced-out"" of the Navy after the incident for giving up our countries intelligence collection methods and capabilities causing grave damage to the security of our nation."
4,The Witch at Life's Crossroads,"Serenity Rose,a witch who can do almost anything would rather be a recluse in her house in the town of Crestfallen. Events follow when she fights a drug crazed vampire and a representative of a another witch tries to buy her services. At the end of the book,Serenity makes a life-changing decision. The comic is funny and gothy and cute. Get this one."
4,Molto Buono (very good),My opinion is that this tape is very good to understand the basics of staff tecniques.
4,Historic and raw,"This was a liberating performance for Lennon and Ono, and an oddly riveting one. The band is loose around the edges, never having played together before, but they end up creating a powerhouse of sound."
3,Chalk and Cheese,"If the second side of the record was as good as side one (first 6 tracks of CD) I would have given it a 4 star rating. When my brother and I first sat down and listened to side one of the vinyl in 1969 we thought , yeah that's good stuff. Turned it over and........well we just looked at each other hoping at some stage there would be an end to the apparent sound of a cat having its tail removed without an anaesthetic, and some music somewhere, but it didn't come. What Lennon (and as a previous reviewer also said, the record company) were thinking when this second side was actually released is fortunately beyond me. First six tracks however are definitely worth a listen, raw but good."
1,Horrible paint quality!,Spend the money and buy GHG or Flambeau Storm Front decoys! Paint lasted only half of duck season horrible decoys!
2,Needs Improvement,"This game is the pretty much the same since '06. I wish these sports games would stop creating optional games like ""The Crown"" and focus more on off-season and in-season stuff. The player trading is just as dumb as '06 (the pc won't trade draft picks). And why in the world won't NBA Live and Madden create conditional and future draft pick trading??? The rookies are better in '08, especially the second rounders that weren't even worth drafting in the previous versions. My recommendation: It's a lot of fun to play, but the franchise mode hasn't changed. But props to EA for continually creating awesome games - they just need a little tweaking in my opinion."
1,YUCK!,"this game to me is like live from last year... it sucks.... i played this using cfw but played only 1 quarter before i quit playing. i dont know why the other guy gave a 5 star review, because this game is horrific.. its exactly like live from last year, which i regrettable bought and played for about 10 games before i bought nba 07 from sony. that game played much better than live and i assume the same can be said about this years version. the graphics are choppy, the controls stink, and i took luol deng to the basket and instead of laying it up, he did a hook shot underneath... pathetic game.. stay away from EA... theyre going to go defunct as soon as they lose their madden license... caveat emptor"
2,Voodoo Child stands out,"6 tracks posthumously released in 1986 without a digital format available sums it up: The JH estate cashes in, but no-one is buying. Track 1 works on a blues level. Foxy Lady is an acid trip. Stop returns to reality. Voodoo Child shines. Stone Free returns to the psychedelic, while Ezy Rider is a Mitch Mitchell drum solo with less than 2 minutes of Jimi on guitar. I recommend the liner notes over the music on the album excepting Voodoo Child. Note: The track is NOT named Voodoo Chile."
5,"FAST, ROCK SOLID, FUN",This Bundle is well worth the money. The BeOS Bible is a great referance for the OS. The Gobe Productive Office suite is also a must have. The BeOS is a very fast and reliable OS. It has a stylish and easy to use interface simmilar to MacOS. Your computer will run Multimedia applications faster than you thought possible. The BeOS is still responsive to your every command even while the PC is working on the most complex tasks. ADDED BONUS The BeOS comes with the software to duel boot windows and BeOS.
5,Sexy Stiletto-Boot,Very sexy and edgy with multiple straps that go past your ankles. Looks like a boot from the back. The shoes are comfortable for a few hours and the insoles are padded. Watch where you're walking because the bottom is soft. It's not ideal for walking around on uneven pavement because it will leave scratches and dents.
3,First bike shorts,"Well made, good value. They look like they will be out-grown before worn-out. We find these to be a child size version of serious cycling shorts complete with padding. It is perfect for a child who will ride for hours on a ""Tag A Long."" We were pleased with the prompt delivery as they were received on the earliest day promised. A big factor in chosing this brand was the sizing charts which were most helpful."
4,Nice shorts,"I got it for my girl for the biking tour, delivered on time and quality is good. But she did not want to wear them, saying it's got too thick lining."
5,Nice shorts.,"Very nice children's bike shorts. I don't know why they shipped the two shorts I ordered separately, though--seems wasteful."
4,excessively convenience-oriented book,On the whole this book is an excellent work.But there is some possibility of fostering illusions in many readers' mind that they actually have great power of research in spite of not having good understanding on basic principles such as statistics.It is not sufficiently equipped for graduate student or researcher above the level.
1,Waste of paper and ink.,It is too close to call -- whether the author intentionally ignores facts or is too lazy to research them. The only people who will enjoy this book are the ones who already knew what they wanted to read into it. This book represents an arrogant and flagrant denial of truth that would not stand up to any academic scrutiny. An insult to anyone hoping for an in-depth study of the issue.
2,Very Biased,"Again, Jeffrey Toobin shows himself as a writer who CANNOT be objective. In a previous book he wrote that I thoroughly enjoyed, ""The Run Of His Life"", Toobin only sees racist black people cheering ""GO OJ GO"" during the freeway chase and not the many whites cheering along with them. In this book, Al Gore and the Democrats are good hearted, bi-partisan, non-combative, innocent victims being cheated by the legal system against the evil and corrupt George Bush and the Republicans. If Al Gore wrote a book on the 2000 election he would be more objective than this guy."
1,Biased writeup of history...,"This could have been a much more interesting book had the author presented a much more balanced view; instead he chose to present everything that the Republicans did with negative connotations, and never challenged the facile reasons the Democrats came up with for their actions. His end of the book demonstrates the conclusion that the author wanted to come up with, and so the information in the previous chapters was selected to try and drive readers to the same conclusion, versus presenting all view points."
3,"A good read, if a bit biased","Jeff Toobin is a good writer - I enjoyed reading this book, just as I enjoyed his other book on the O.J. Simpson trial.""Too Close To Call"" is very Gore-centric, however, perhaps because Toobin himself is a Democrat and has made no secret of the fact that he thinks Al Gore should have won the 2000 election. But his bias doesn't distract too much from the interesting tidbits he provides about the campaigns, both before and after election day.I do recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the historic 2000 election fight, but be aware that Toobin is far from an impartial commentator.The liberal bias is made somewhat less annoying by the fact that Bush ran away with Florida in 2004, winning the state easily."
1,Author's Bias Does Him In,"Save your time, and your money.The scope of this tome and the intricate level of detail achieved within its pages are commendable. Unfortunately, from the very start of the book, Mr. Toobin's raging bias in favor of Mr. Gore ruins the presentation of his thesis and the facts supporting his conclusions. Where the facts are not favorable to Mr. Gore (and the author), they are conveniently omitted or made irrelevant.Mr. Toobin's book will surely appeal to die-hard supporters of Mr. Gore and partisans of the liberal left in America. Sadly, readers seeking the truth will have to look elsewhere."
2,One of the worst of the lot,"I had high hopes for this author and was sorely disappointed. Though the writing is fresh and compelling, Toobin makes no news and, more important, reveals his bias from the first page to the last. Even a reader sympathethic to Gore's position will likely find little here of any substance; the book is so one-sided that it sounds more like never-ending talking points than the serious, thoughtful accounts offered by many of Toobin's predecessors."
2,"Good Information, Poor Analysis","Toobin's work has some great detail and insight into the recount and from that perspective it's an interesting read. In the final analysis, Toobin's work is a disappointment because of its final analysis - that "". . . in any real, moral and democratic sense, Al Gore should have been declared the victor over George W. Bush - in the popular vote, in Florida, and in the Electoral College.""It's disappointing because Toobin surely knows that the national popular vote is irrelevant in presidential elections. Were the popular vote the deciding factor then both candidates would have conducted their campaigns far differently. Yes, it appears that a good number of likely Gore supporters voted wrong; so what? There is no perfect election. There were undoubtedly errors in other Florida counties, in other states. In the final analysis, if Al Gore had just managed to carry his home state of Tennessee, he wouldn't have even needed to win Florida."
2,Disappointed,"While I have read several books about the 2000 election, I must admit that I looked forward to reading Toobin's. In the end, however, I was disappointed by his inability to present an unbiased account of what happened. Toobin does an exceptionally poor job of hiding his bias and makes his conclusion, that Bush somehow ""stole"" the election from the more deserving Gore, crystal clear. In so doing, he glosses over some of the very questionable tactics employed by Gore and his operatives in their attempt to generate more votes."
3,Pretty Good Little Book,"This was a pretty good little book for the money. However, it was largely a slimmed-down version of Lost Liners, which I highly recommend. Some new pictures were featured, but much of it was rehash."
5,A very nice book,This book is very nicely put together. This not only covers the RMS Titanic but it also covers the sister ship that also had gone down as well as a good three other ghost liners. This book is a must have. Highly recommended for readers ranging from 6th - 9th grade readers.
5,Crazy price on good item,This item is readily available for $10-$15 at many places on Internet- Either seller here made a huge mistake or is trying to make a huge profit margin.
1,Oh my gosh this flash drive sucks!!!,"I bought this flash drive 3 days ago. Used it yesterday. Spent 3 hours downloading pictures and documents into the flash drive. Today the item doesn't work. After ranting and raving about this crappy product, my friend mentioned that her husband bought the same flash drive, and his didn't work either. COBY manufacturers...you should be ashamed of yourselves!"
5,God Uses Cracked Pots by Patsy Clairmont,This book really hits home in most of the short stories she tells. She is a great author!
4,A marvelous trip,"This Album is deffinately a trip and enjoyable from begining to end with the exception of 1 song. Frankly even that is a good song, just not quite my taste as much as the rest of the album."
3,An OK book,Not as good as some of the other books I've seen in this series but as always a wonderful collection of cartoonists.
1,hat came with bent bill and top looks shriveled like its been washed almost,"I like my hats to have a straight bill meaning its not curved/bent. This one came curved. The top of the hat also looks kind of shriveled like older hats that have been washed or wet become.I'm thinking of returning this hat, but its such a pain in the butt."
3,Very jazzy piano,"Walt Wagner is obviously an extremely talented piano player. He has a fine command of the keyboard, and is very skillful at arranging the music to suit his tastes. That's where the problem comes for me. I like a lighter hand with the jazz; more ""straight"", albeit with lots of altered chords. What he does is great piano. What I want is a slightly different type of great piano. Another player I've listened to is Jim Haskins. He's also good, but a little too ""straight"", insufficiently jazzy. I guess I'll keeps looking."
1,junk,"They are junk. Works then won't work, really you need them you are stuck. The hole easy track is like an entry level rail setup so I think they just don't care."
2,Flimsy,The wire popped through this in about a week. My son used it as a laundry basket. Don't waste your money.
3,good size but floppy,This hamper is really big but it is very flexible so it often tips over when my son throws his clothes in it.
5,sturdy for pop up hamper,These hampers may appear to be flimsy but I found the opposite to be true.They hold their shape very well no matter how much is thrown in.They are actually bigger than they might appear and clean looking.
2,Colors off,I ordered this in lime green and checked out the picture from the manufacturer's website just to be sure of the color. It looked like the fresh green I needed. In fact the bag that arrived was a shocking NEON green that was almost yellow. I needed sunglasses to look at the thing. So it is basically hidden in a closet until I find a replacement because it does not coordinate with the current decor color known as lime green...that I have all over my house. Function wise: this item appears to be very well made and holds my toddlers plushy collection easily. I am sure there are people who simply don't care about color and just go for function but I bought this specifically for the supposed color of the item first with functionality being second. Descriptions and photos need to be a bit better for accuracy's sake.
1,NOT QUITE,This book does not really give concrete and detailed pest and desease control methods. It does not give any information about chemicals and insecticides for specific problems. It is actually really useless.
2,Poor coverage of diseases and pests,"First off, it's extremely difficult to identify a pest or disease by description alone. By the cover, which showed picture after picture, I thought for sure each disease or insect infestation would have a picture to help with identification. There were only a handful of the many plant diseases and insect damage that one encounters. I ended up using Davesgarden.com for my diagnosis."
3,It's okay,"This is a book for a more experienced gardener. You almost need to be able to look at a plant and know what the disease/infestation might be before finding it in this book. It would be more helpful to have a section with a listing of plants/trees and their susceptabilities. I actually had to look up the plant in another reference book to find out what disease/infestation a certain plant may be susceptible to, then I was able to look that up in this book."
1,Get these songs on CD,"Why pay an exorbitant price for this obsolete cassette tape? All of these songs are available on the ""Beatles 1"" CD from Amazon for $9.99 brand new!!"
1,What a Rip!!!,"I don't usually write reviews for sellers (I think it quite asinine), but the fact that both of these sellers are attempting to sell something that costs roughly 20 dollars on other websites is completely insane. I saw the same journal being sold on this website yesterday for 94 cents from the seller gohastings. So this is a plea to either one of the sellers (or an warning to the person who would be foolish enough to buy this incredibly overpriced journal), use the real price! I would love to actually buy this journal from Amazon (either one of you) because I have gift card credit. I don't want to spend money outside of Amazon to buy this notebook but I will (I like Goethe!). To be honest NO ONE would buy a simple lined journal for $216 or $270."
5,Earl Klugh CD order,Excellent CD - one of Klugh's best. Beautiful acoustic jazz guitar that fits the mood for almost any occasion. Satisfied with the quality of the product and service.
4,Last Flight Out,Randy is as good at telling stories about his true adventures as he is at creating the fiction adventures of Doc Ford...each page takes command of the reader's finger and before you know it pages have been turned and you find yourself at the last story; always wishing there was just one more.Rick Magers[...]
3,Good vs Bad,"Bad-Tastes revolting! Super sweet and icky!!!!Good- 42 grams of protein in 3 swallows!!!!!! Can't say enough about that! I struggle to get enough protein in my diet, so this is great. Just plug your nose and give it a gulp.Summary-Worth it in the end!"
2,"Fine--but William Sonoma ""Seafood"" is better","Fine, beautiful pics and some nice recipes but if deciding between this and william sonoma ""seafood"" book, the seafood one is much better in my opinion...better recipes and variety of recipes."
5,wonderful,You can just make so many fish dinners without recipes. This book has such a variety of different things to use. It will come in handy.
4,readable historical account that is very relevant today,"I came to this book as someone interested in new media rather than as an art historian, and I found it fascinating. Fried uses Diderot and other eighteen century art critics' writing to understand how the beholder of paintings is positioned. He uses an abundance of paintings (reproduced in good quality black and white) and citations of art criticism to show the ways in which painted characters ignore the beholder, first by being absorbed in quiet activities, and later in self-abandonment. While the beholder is clearly set apart from the represented world in history paintings, Diderot also writes about entering landscape paintings, stepping inside the world.I found the book very readable and thought-provoking, and relevant to far more than just eighteenth century French art. Personally I will use it in relation to our current notions of immersion and interactivity."
2,Looks lovely but arrived damaged,"This chair looked lovely, but it arrived with a huge crack in the frame. Had to send it back."
2,Sloppy fit.,"This fit too loosely. It wouldn't allow the phone to close completely. I guess the tacky surface keeps it from slipping out of your pocket, but it also makes it harder to drag out of your purse. The mall phone kiosk had a better one for the same price, no shipping."
2,Jerzees disappointment,"I have been buying Jerzee T shirts at retail stores for years. I have never been disappointed. They wear well and launder well. I had not been able to find long sleeve shirts in local retail stores, so I went online.The quality is just not there. There is no warmth to the shirts. The material is very thin. I put one shirt on the bathroom door while showering. When I got out of the shower, I was able to see the doorknob through the shirt. I think you call this THIN. I have also noticed that the hooded sweatshirts in retail stores share this same quality...or lack of it. Looks like I need to find a new brand of long sleeve T shirt. I think a call is in order to the company."
1,The most frustrating and subjective biography ever written!!,"I have always been impressed with the man T.S. Eliot but I cannot say the same about his biogrpaher, Lyndall Gordon. This book made my eyes go buggy and released the bats in the bellfry of my brain! I read this book when I was very sick and it was a very poor choice to say the least. I found her writing style thick with euphemisms, abrstractions, and other vague notions. Very little is mentioned about the man Eliot himself! What a ridiculous concept for a biography. She includes far too many segments of his poetry that only make sense in context. She spews them all over the book and leaves the reader wondering aloud, ""Say what?"". Though this book has a marvelous, intriguing cover it has nothing but blurry accounts of the man, T.S. Eliot. Find another biographer and you will be better off."
1,Hagiography,"This is not a biography, but a hagiography. Others have noted that it seems more about his work than his life. There is probably a good reason for that. For a corrective, see Carole Seymour-Jones, Painted Shadow: The Life of Vivienne Eliot. This gives us a better idea of what Eliot was like. I find it hard to understand that a book published in 1998 as this was is so terrified that Eliot was a homosexual. The portrait she paints of his idyllic marriage to Valerie Fletcher is hilarious--a 68 year old famous man finds ""love"" for the first time with a 30 year old who worships him. Well, it takes all kinds. Perhaps this author does not believe that gays can ""love"" one another. This book does not even deserve one star."
3,Perhaps Eliot was wise in distrusting biographers,"Perhaps Eliot was wise in his distrust of biographers. Perhaps he knew his true essence could not be known by someone who did not know him personally. I'm in agreement that this work is more a critique of Eliot's work across his lifetime than an open window into his life. Gordon becomes most descriptive while discussing his conversion, his philosophy and religious quest. This is mingled with her tendency to paint him as a depressed, detached character unable to commit to his lifelong love interest due to his rigidity. In this way the work is also critique of the person and character of T.S. Eliot. If academically accurate, this book, is rather dry in it's writing style. It left me wanting something richer and deeper still about what it meant to live the life of T.S. Eliot. This work may be brilliant but seemed plodding to me."
2,Sort of awful,"The biographer is so obsessed with Eliot's enigmatic inner state that she forgets to mention the things that happened to him during his life. Gordon speaks of Eliot's desire to enlist in WWI without ever explaining why; she never mentions his attitude toward World War II; she doesn't say that he was expelled from high school, what he majored in at college, what his income was during his years of fame, what kind of contact he kept in with his family and how they thought of him later in his life, what kind of contions he liked to write under in the early years, why he put so many allusions in his poetry if he disdained allusion-hunting. On the other hand, we do get excruciatingly detailed biographies of women like Emily Hale, Mary Trevelyan, and Vivienne Haighwood. The book tries to bore into Eliot's psyche and present all of his poetry as autobiographical, despite the damage done to readings of both the life and the poetry."
3,Not quite a biography,"The book ""T.S. Eliot: An Imperfect Life"" is not quite a biography but it is more an interpretation of Eliot's work from the point of view of his biography. Furthermore, the book concentrates on Eliot's poetry and his dramatic work - his critical work his almost neglected."
4,Solid Hitch,"Hitch is different than pictured (they should update the pic because I would've bought it sooner if I knew what I know now). It has a couple of chain hook holes (not sure what you call them) which is perfect for latching on log chains without inserting a drop-down. I did have to bend the U bolts so that they would span the back frame piece but was able to achieve that with a little leverage. Take note that you determine which nuts are the 8mm and the 5/16ths because they look the same and are very close in size. Tried to put one of the 5/16ths on the 8mm bolt and needless to say, that didn't go well until I figured out my mistake. Overall impressed with the build (it is solid) and it came quicker than advertised from the store. I would order from them again."
1,Kind of cheap,This product works for everything but cell phone use. It broke too easily and the metal base is too large to fit inside the casing that many cell phones have protruding around the audio jack.
5,A wonderful depiction of the need for morals in society.,"The Village Poet is a wise and noble man who has traveled near and far, in search of the acquisition of knowledge. He is a respectable man who is loved and adored by all in his village. Moreover, the Village Poet does not lecture the villagers. His tone seems to be calm and sincere. In his speech, he challenges the villagers to embrace life. Furthermore, he encourages the villagers to be steadfast and to endure. The poet proceeds to speak to the villagers about patience and instructs them to be still and explore the forest of life. In addition, the poet challenges the villagers to never disrespect human virtue and not to mistake kindness for weakness."
5,"Wilton Avanti Everglide Metal-Safe Non-Stick Cookie Pan, 17 1/4 x 11 1/2 x 1 Inches","Wilton Avanti Everglide Metal-Safe Non-Stick Cookie Pan, 17 1/4 x 11 1/2 x 1 InchesVery nice piece of bakeware! High quality, great value!"
1,Terrible Disappointment,"These pans are horrible. They warped the first time I used them in the oven and stayed warped after cooling. The product description states, ""Commercial weight construction prevents warping..."" So much for truth in advertising. I bought two so I wasted $32. DO NOT BUY THIS WORTHLESS ITEM!"
3,"Heavy for the price, but still warps","I purchased this product based upon all 5-star reviews and a product description that included the words, ...""Commercial Weight Construction Prevents Warping...."" While it doesn't specifically state it will not warp, that's what it implies. Not so! It does warp. However, having said that, it is still a very good price for the pan and I'll keep it."
1,It's quite a shame...,"""The Black Donnellys"" is a terrible shame. Mr. Kelley's book is unresearched and goes out of it's way to make the Donnellys look as black and evil as possible. His second book is an even more fictionalized account of the Donnelly's lives. Unfortunately, most of Canada's knowledge comes from these two books. If you are at all interested in the Donnellys, I urge you to read the books by Orlo Miller and the plays by James Reaney. Both are more researched, and paint a much clearer picture of what really happened in Biddulph and Lucan almost 100 years ago."
3,Love's Bounty,"After reading so many of Rosanne Bittner's books, I suppose I have come to expect more from her. This book kept my attention while reading, but when I was done I felt that there was so much more that could have been written. I will say if you liked Oregon Bride, Arizona Bride, or Montana Woman you will probably like this book. I have always thought she does so much better with her Indian books. However I will continue to buy Ms. Bittner's books for as long as she continue's to write them."
4,SCOTCH-BRITE A WINNER,"Scotch-Brite by 3M is a great product. Generally speaking anything marketed by 3M works as advertised. Scotch-Brite is a good example. However, if it is 3M you're going to pay well for the product. In this case there isn't a good alternative, when there is, you can save money with alternate brands."
5,American philosopher Mortimer Adler - a must-read modern philosophy book,"In this book, Six Great Ideas, Adler meticulously breaks down six well known concepts into two triads. Truth, beauty & goodness are the first three concepts while justice, liberty and equality are the next. This is a brilliant text albeit Adler's writing style and depth of discussion is initially challenging. This book is a fine complimentary foundation for one to begin their journey in search of the truth. It is highly rational, not academic in voice and reveals wisdom that would be beneficial to all. Adler spices up the discussion when he notes that five of the six ideas are encapsulated in our nation's Declaration of Independence. He also warns us that it only in the realm of doubt that we can pursue the truth. Adler tackles one of the big questions in life, how do we know good from bad, when he writes that 'good is when we desire what we need [to survive]/' Get the context: get the book."
3,New one coming out December 06,"This is a good book, but an updated edition is supposed to come out December 2006 so wait until then if you want this book."
3,HotMetal Cool Off,"When I first started using HoTMetal 6.0 I was pretty happy with it. If you are making one or two page websites it is fine. The larger the website, the less I liked it. I have had a number of the URL conversion and publishing features not work, with no apparent work-around. If you want a website you can view on your computer, but not on the world wide web, this is the program for you. If you need a dependable program for a small business, look somewhere else."
5,An Excellent Program!,"This program is awesome! Not only do you have the option of building a webpage in the WYSIWYG format, but you can also instantly flip to the HTML code,the unique tags on view, or preview it in a browser. While there may not be many books written on this program, HoTMetaL Pro is easy to use by anyone, yet it offers the more advanced features that are commonly found in more expensive programs."
3,Not for beginner,"I am basically a novice at creating web pages. I have created acceptable web pages using Front Page Express, and FrontPage 2000. I downloaded a trial version of Hotmetal Pro, and tried it as well. I found the program ponderous and definitely not for someone who just wanted to easily create a website and be done with it. I have no doubt I could have figured it out if I had wanted to spend several hours experimenting with it. But I simply wanted to create a website, and not learn the intricacies of HTML and the intricacies of this program. I rated it a 3 because it is probably a good program for people who want to get more involved with it, but it was not for me."
3,Great if you can work it out,"The software is good and does what it says it can do. There are more features there than I will ever use.The wizards are OK but inflexible. For example, it creates a site for you with duly labelled nav buttons, which you can't edit 'cos they're single layer GIFs. You have to remake the buttons yourself.The User Guide is a parson's egg too - good in parts. It does seem though that the software and its guide have not been developed together. Some parts are very sketchy and could do with cross-references to outside sources, for example, editing CSS stylesheets.The interface could do with bringing into the 21st century.That seems negative but it's not a lot really. On the whole, I found HoTMetaL easier than DW3 and more reliable than Front Page. It's very good value for money, but I look forward to the next release!"
4,It's sort of a no-brainer,"I've used HoTMetaL Pro for over 5 years. We built our first web pages using this app. At that time I didn't know anything about HTML, etc and still managed to build a (primarily text based) site that worked. It is fairly easy to learn and use. New versions over the years have added smart features. There are similar apps on the market, but this one seems less buggy than most."
2,HOTMETAL MELTDOWN !,"Hotmetal Pro? I will say that this software is useful, IF YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WEB SITES! It is easy to use,for basic pages.There are many features which were forgotten.My advice is whether you are a novice or professional webmaster I would first look at IBM WEBSPHERE HOMEPAGE BUILDER it is a much ""simpler"" and ""useful"" software package than Hotmetal Pro will ever be. The best part is there about the same price.Check it out!"
3,Expensive,The pins themselves work fine with nary a jam. (that's the way they should work)The box they come in was plastic and because they only put in 2500 pins there is a lot of extra space which cracked during shipment. Had they not been so cheap they could have filled the plastic box with a full count of 5000 and there would have been no problem. Things today are more than twice the cost they were ten years ago and it's getting aggravating. They get only three stars because they are so cheap by not giving a full count of 5000 pins.
4,So many good bands coming out..,"The Raveonettes certainly have their own distinct music stylings. The cd sounds relatively lo fi with a guitar sound that is very reminiscent of the fuzzy distortion used by such bands as Jesus and Mary Chain and B.R.M.C. It is difficult to find a comparison for the very ominous sounding vocals so I won't bother, but when joined with the crunchy guitar riffs, The Raveonettes produce a sound that makes you want to shave your head and get naked . . . well that's what I did. Just kidding. In conclusion: sick band, great sound, solid cd. Yea."
3,Lot's of trippy guitar fuzz. Wipe out!,"Be prepared for a whirlwind spliff-induced stupor. The Raveonettes are much in the same vein as The Warlocks or Black Rebel Motorcycle Club of reviving tripped-out guitar-distorted late 60's psychadelia. The Jesus and Mary Chain comparisions seem to constantly pop-up to describe these trippy-snare-pounding-guitar-fuzz-thrash bands, and 'Whip It On' is no different. The vocals have this ominious Clientele-like drone, a twinge of slick 50's rebelliousness (just think Rumble by Link Wray on speed) and even a bit of XTRMNTR by Primal Scream. Listening to this CD, you can sense the free-wheeling danger, and if you concentrate hard enough, you'll be able to smell the leather jackets and motorcycle diesel in the air."
2,1 Star for each of the songs I liked,"I bought this CD knowing what to expect: A mini album with very similar songs in the same tone. I was a little dissapointed after finally hearing it. Don't get me wrong, this is a very original group with a very distinctive sound and I respect any group who will go out and try something new, but this album really didn't move me. Hell, it didn't really even touch me. I bought it after hearing Attack of the Ghost Riders because it is a great and original song, but everything after, with the exception of Beat City, is quite dull. Beat City is a great song which actually gets this cd going. Unfortunately, that kick is at the very end of the cd. I really think they have the potential to make a great cd, they just need to make a longer cd with a little more diversity. I will give them credit in being original and for the two great songs on the cd."
2,Vibes are all it has going for it,"You only need to look at the title of the song ""Attack of the Ghost Riders"" to know what you're in for. As that song title would suggest, this album has a campy, 50s teen slasher flick feel to it. You can almost see the supernatural antagonist riding off into the night on a motorcycle, looking to cause some chaos. Unfortunately, that vibe is all this album has going for it. Most of the songs sound the same, and almost all of them are skip-worrthy. Beat City is good, and Attack of the Ghost Riders is almost memorable, but you'll forget everything else the moment the stereo turns off. This band has good ideas, they just haven't completely developed them yet."
4,Dark and brooding fun,"The tendency upon first hearing the Raveonettes is to immediately compare them to such bygone acts as Jesus & Mary Chain and X, and other even newer bands such as Black Rebel Motorcycle Club; and this comparison is justified. While this duo is certainly in this lineage, they can hardly be accused of unoriginality. These two manage to create a dark, brooding, yet dancy style that is all their own, while paying tribute to those before them. Everything from the guitars drowning in feedback to the droning vocals, even to the cover, which seems like something out of a 50's sci-fi film, has been done before, but they manage to avoid the pitfalls of mediocrity by taking all these elements and making them their own - this does not feel like a first album; they are very comfortable in their niche. If you are a fan of the bands mentioned above, this album is well worth the $, and you can feel comfortable in listening to it without the feel of recycled material."
5,The characters come alive!,"A lively and interesting pop-up creation! I think the pop-ups are intricately designed and created to make the stories come alive and more enjoyable to read! An interactive way to read Dr. Seuss's remarkable writing. Unfortunately, the stories are not full versions. I wish they were. So, don't expect to find all the stories in one book with interesting pop-ups."
5,Solid instruction with a real life focus,"Because the instructor on this dvd (and it's companion volume 1) is a cop as well as a long-time jujitsu man, the instruction is combat oriented rather than sport style. There are some elements of sport style jujitsu but I liked the focus on more traditional teaching and the way you got both the offensive and defensive view of each technique. For most techniques, the instructor explains how to apply it then we get to hear from his partner about why the technique works and also how he would counter it. This is a really good teaching method and allows both training partners to work their skills, rather than one guy working on a technique and the other being the ""crash test dummy"". Excellent all around overview of jujitsu."
5,"Good price, good quality!","The hammock is softer than i thought it would be since it's not cotton. Great quality for 88 bucks and well-made. Much better than those $30 jobs I was seeing on amazon! Glad I paid the $88. Beautiful color as well. It's not as wide as it looks in the picture, but definitely large enough for two people. It's about 4 feet wide and stretches. I was hesitant to buy this because there were no product reviews, but if you are looking for an earthy, comfy and classy, solid quality hammock - this is it!"
3,How is all this powered,"I have read many of the reviews, some great and others so-so. But one thing that frustrates me is the lack of information on this product. Somehow going to a store makes it easy to touch and feel what it has and what is needed. I cannot find anything that talks about how this thing is powered let alone more detailed pictures and product descriptions/requirements. For example, I have a Dodge Neon so how would I mount this thing let alone what powers it and my iPod. I'm fairly new to the iPod products so my 3 stars is due to the lack of pre-purchase information provided by Amazon. Sorry but I want to buy this thing today but it's hard to do so with answered questions."
4,thumbs up,"I had an Itrip. I didn't like the itrip playlist of frequencies. I found locking on a frequency in that playlist awkward. I found reception often to be marginal. The Podfreq frequency set up is easy, an up and down button for frequency adjust with a direct readout. Stability and reception seemed much improved over the Itrip. Very satisfied with the unit."
5,Guide for Non Profits Fundraising,"This source is a wonderful collection of information for non profit companies who want to expand to the Internet. It has real world suggestions, as well as IRS guidelines important to keep the tax status of the non profit. Recommend to all."
5,Staffing chapter is the best!,"We are fortunate to have Tim Mills-Groninger consulting with us at the Tai Sophia Institute; his chapter on staffing is excellent and the issues of enthusiasm, expertise, trainability, maximizing systems, etc. are good reminders between visits."
3,Non-Profits For Entrepreneurs,Well paced and organized. This book provides very practical information about starting a successful nonprofit.
3,It wasn't bad,"Lawrence Hill's thought-provoking 2001 memoir (nearly a decade before The Book of Negroes) left me contemplating racism in Canada, the meaning of race as a social construct, and also left me wondering how members of my own family who are of mixed race feel about their racial identity.But you know what I couldn't get out of my head, the whole time I was reading this?Lawrence Hill's brother is Dan Hill. Did you all know that? I had no idea! So this was going through my head literally the whole time I was reading this book:""Sometimes when we touch...the honesty's too much...and I have to close my eyes and hide...""Oh Dan Hill. I forgot how much I loved you!"
1,dont buy,dont buy this game unless you just got a 1500 dollor gaming computer if not you wont be able to play because it needs way to many things to run like my computer wont run because it doesnt have a shader 3 i mean come on a shader 3 what is that any way so dont buy it
1,requirements,I was unable to play this game because it requires a game computer with a processor of 3.0 MGH and a special video card.
4,Good game... sorta,It is pretty good with everything being destructible. But I had to download some special tool to force triple buffering in order to stop the super lag. That tool made the jump from lag at lowest specs to no to slight lag on highest specs. For anyone wanting to know the tool is D3DOverrider.
3,Mercenaries 2: World in Flames,"Playability is good, to a point. There are missions within the game that once you take them, there is no backing away from them. If you don't complete them, TOUGH, you are locked into it forever, UNLESS you saved before, and didn't save over it with the nonsense of the self looping mission.Graphics are goodI'm not a big fan of First Person Shooters, in fact, I hate them, this game is ok. It does take some skill to get through some of the missions in there, and for the most part, once you get used to the way the game handles, you're pretty solid for getting things done.(Again, I'm an RTS-Real Time Strategy game player).Would I recommend this, not a chance in hades, most of my friends don't do FPS either, but one of them talked highly about this game, so I tried it on his recommendation and I will admit it was alright, but not great, and subsequently, not worth referral, unless of course they cleaned up the missions, which, I don't see them doing."
4,Action Adventure,"Mercenaries 2 is a great game with 20+ hours of game play. It's not to stressful and it's an open world action adventure. Open world games are the only game's I like to buy, especially good clean fun games. Dark twisted games are depressing. I play games to escape the worries of this world, not have my nose rubbed in them. Game makers need to lighten up. Give me more freedom in a game not mind numbing obstacle's just to make the game take longer to finish. Don't get me wrong, hero quests are great, I can play them all day long and come away satisfied. The top rated games prove my point. Mod-able games are even better. I recommend Mercenaries 2 for many of the above reasons. Keep up the good work."
2,Not Next Gen,"This game is a GTA clone in the end. Mercs will always be GTA like. I like the ability to hijack vehicles. I think this franchise is headed in the right direction in these ways. That said, this game is repetitive and a little boring. It is fun to nuke stuff, but that doesn't make a great game. This game is buggy out the wazzoo and the interface is lacking both in-game and out. It feels like a beta, but it is for sure far from a quality where todays games should be.This game is a bad port from the PS3 and 360 versions. I wish that companies would at least try to develop their games better. NEVER pay more than $28 for this game. It's only really worth $20 max, and I mean $20 should have been the release price.Shame on the developer."
1,Crap!,"horrible graphics,lousy controls, you can find a better game online that is free!don't waste your money!"
1,Online no longer works!!!!,"I spent 2 hours installing this on mine and my wife's computer to play some co-op action (I bought two copies from a Download distributor). So after I got it installed I discovered I couldn't connect to the EA servers... After some research I found out that EA took the servers down for this game in March, rendering it impossible as of now to play a game in co-op. There is no LAN option either.So out of my anger/disappointment I am writing this review, I usually don't but the world must know, the world must know before we get The World In Flames... That it is broken."
2,Hard to play,"Unless you have one of the top of the line video cards on your computer, don't bother buying this game."
4,Highly Addictive,"This is a highly addictive game with lots of variety and is very open-ended. The graphics are very good, the game play takes a little getting used-to. It was a little confusing at first - like which symbols stand for what, and controlling the vehicles was hard at first as well. [...].I'm not sure why people rate it lower than 4 stars. If your computer is not up to par, that's not a reflection on the game people!"
2,Not Bad,"Had an issue with multilayer not working, and the game became repedative half way beating it"
4,Merchs 2,"This is a great installment to the Merch series, the game has some beautiful graphics, and watching the explosions is quite entertaining. However some of the missions are pretty repetitive. And everynow and then the game has a glitch that will cause your relationship to other factions to go down. This game was very reluctant to play on my toshiba satellite x-205. make sure that you have your graphics card drivers updated. also make sure you have an internet connection before attempting to play this game for the first time, and make sure you are not connected when starting a game, to make sure you can continue the game when not connected."
3,Complicated Game,"Not a great game really - I mean, the actual game play is fun but the obscure symbols and ""clues"" are very confusing and if you play the game a while and stop for a couple of days, good luck remembering what the little clues mean. There is no mention of these things in the printed material with the game so I had to go to game forums to find out what they meant and what you were supposed to do when you saw one."
3,a story within the civil war,"Drew comes to red springs and boyd his younger brother wants to join the rebs. Then theres a couple of battles and then rear guard action as they retreat.The rebs are always short on resources, plundering the yankees where they can.there are some interesting skirmishes and dealing with bushwackers.But the story just tracked the movements of the conderacy to the west until their surrender. Perhaps if therevwasba prequel, it would have been best to read this in order to give the story more depth."
4,Andre Norton but not SciFi,"When I bought this book, I was expecting more SciFi, but this Civil War book displays the same talent for developing characters and making you a part of the scene as Norton's SciFi books do. Great read!"
3,Not as Good as the First CD,"There were a few good songs on this one, but the rest were very average and bland compared to all the great tracks on their self-titled CD. I liked ""Flesh and Blood"" and ""Daniel,"" which is obviously a cover of the Elton John song. I recommend just buying the greatest hits CD because you get the good ones without all the filler."
5,Good by,"Apart of other songs of this album: Fueled For Houston, Goodbye Carmen,Give It Up, Don't Take Me Down, for this server are very special."
4,a brilliant survey,"Janet Lynn Roseman's interviews are an essential look at the living history of dance and will be valued by fans, students, practitioners, and scholars in the years to come. (By the way, the Amazon.com price is absurd; order it directly from the publisher. And, BTW, the binding is not a ""library binding"" as Amazon.com insists; it's paperback.)"
1,More Knee-Jerk Delusions,"This book is typical of the knee-jerk arrogant blindness many suffer when hiding Clinton's flaws. For readability, I would give it 3 or 4 stars, but for accuracy, it would get negative stars. Hence, my 1 star rating."
4,Biased But Good,"Before I read this book, I thought the president should have resigned. After I read this book I still thought the president should have resigned. However, the author doesn't share that view. In some ways he is an apologist for the Clintons and that is rather crudely evident. However, I had no idea how unsavory were the forces aligned against him. Toobin gives us a view into a very unsavory and I think immoral group of characters who in some ways were every bit as wrong and immoral as Clinton. Even though I found myself cringing at times with his defense of the president (and don't doubt it, he defends him) I was cringing at those points in the book which did show that a rag-tag bunch of shady characters was trying to overtrow an election through the judicial process. That is evident from some of the insider-perspectives Toobin gives his readers. It's scary to think that one day, a group like this will succeed against a president I really like."
4,Fascinating reading.,"It truly is amazing that as I write this, Bill Clinton enjoys a job approval rating of at 63% in most polls, while most, if not all of the people who tried so hard to destroy him have fallen, are disgraced, or reviled.I'm no big fan of Bill Clinton, but after reading this eye-opener, I think someone should write another book about Clinton and his enemies entitled: ""Still standing after all they've done."""
1,Not the worst book ever but in the top ten,There should be a zero star rating - this would certainly get it. This is not the worst book ever written on a political subject but it ranks as one of the most lapdoggy treatments of a significant part of our history. It may not have been written in the White House but it looks like they approved the drafts - even with that it still raises some significant issues about the President's behavior. It also raises whether the Congressional Leadership actually exercised any.Much better and more factual book is from Richard Posner.
1,Fawning apologist trash for the Clinton Criminal Enterprise,"Toobin, the admitted ""mouthpiece"" of Hillary, (from whom he got the ""secret"" court [and other] documents -- according to his appearance with Imus) has produced something thats greatest utility would be in replacing the old Sears & Roebuck catalogue in any remaining outhouses across the nation. Don't waste your time, money or effort -- utterly worthless."
1,It is regretful that Amazon requires a minimum of one star.,"A fascinating account of how a rapist (yes, I believe Juanita Broderick) beguiled the nation, and in particular it's women, into thinking that he is really just a well-intentioned rogue.Mr. Toobin states that Clinton's crimes are ""essentially private,"" yet he then praises Judge Wright's contempt ruling. Odd that a lawyer would support the notion that private behavior might qualify as contempt of court. This is the logical extension of his thinking but, not surprisingly, he doesn't follow it. If you hold to either of those positions, the other becomes untenable. Reminiscent of many Democratic Senators who fulminated about the personal nature of Clinton's crimes, yet supported censure. Why should congress be censuring Presidents for private behavior? Alas, the kneepad crowd wants to have it both ways."
2,Disappointing,"Toobin's thesis is interesting--that the conspiracy involved the left, the right, and the media, but he fails to develop it. His politics are transparent, his logic faulty, and his prose, painfully glib. Smart and smarmy."
1,Utter tripe; all the veracity of Mein Kampf,"Toobin has long been a Clinton cheerleader and an extremely dubious ""legal scholar"" on Good Morning America. With this book he hits new lows.Even I, who tried to avoid as much of the Clinton situation as I could, spotted a half dozen or more outright falsehoods in his book as well as conclusion after conclusion which was supported by neither fact nor logic.This is a true work of utter, utter nonsense which only the most ardent (and close minded) Clinton supporter could actually believe. The ""most powerful man in the world"" is a victim. Give me a break.Toobin's words are routinely lousy on GMA and his words in this book are no better - probably worse.The only reason I give this book one star is that I couldn't give it fewer."
1,Review of Vast Conspiracy,This book continued to distract and deny the truth. I felt this book was written from news clips. I thought I was having a flashback of the news media. The book sounded like Clinton's lawyers. I hope someone makes a book called the Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy because this book would fit. He fails to mention how Bill wanted Monica to tell Linda to lie in court. But in this book I felt the truth did not matter. (who paid him to write this book? Clinton's? )I made a mistake by buying this book and supporting the left-wing conspiracy. This book all-round was nothing but lies and distracting.
4,Exposes the greed behind the scandal,"If you didn't follow the case closely, this is the book. If you did, you will find little new material here. The source notes and bibliography at the back show he did little in the way of original research or interviews.Even so, Toobin is a talented and insightful writer. He is neutral in tone toward the President and in my opinion rightfully critical of the method used by his accusers.He clinically exposes the greed of those ruled by a hatred of Clinton and an eagerness to profit from the hysterical rumors about Clinton. It tells how that greed caused some individuals to set aside their concern for the country, its laws and the judgment of the citizens at large.If so many people didn't lust after a ""book deal"" the whole failed impeachment would never have happened. This book will stay on my shelf, but my favorite on the subject of the Clinton scandals is ""Fools for Scandal."""
2,the vast conspiracy,"Toobin's insights into some of the ""players"" were interesting. Other than that, it was a re-run of everything we heard and saw during the whole dismal affair."
1,Another Apologist At Work,"Guess it was about time a Clinton Apologist writes about the ""unfair"" attack on Clinton. Save yourself the money, do not buy this book, just go read the Washington Post and New York Times in your public library, to hear their apologies and you will get Toobin's angle as well. Clinton continues to lead the nation with his trickle-down-immorality."
2,Isikoff's book is better,"There's really nothing factually new here we haven't read before....which means the thrust of this book is Toobin's spin on it all. Frankly, that does not make for interesting reading and it's definitely not enough to carry an entire book. As you can tell from the other reviews, your own personal opinion on Bill Clinton will determine how you veiw this book - love Bill, love the book; hate Bill, hate the book. Still, I imagine even the Bill lovers tired 2/3 the way through this book.I think Michael Isikoff's ""Uncovering Clinton"" is a far better book for getting a handle on the whole Lewinsky affair."
1,Clinton's Good Friend Writes About Clinton,"Toobin has admitted he's good friends with Bill Clinton. Be honest with yourself, how biased would you be if you wrote about a good friend?"
3,How should I know if this book is good? I haven't read it.,"I gave this book three stars because that's the current average of the 11 ""reviews"" I've seen to date, and I didn't want to skew it either way with this note. Too bad there's no way to ensure that someone has actually read a book before reviewing it, instead of using this forum as yet one more chance to promote a political point of view or make personal attacks anonymously. Nice idea, Amazon, but this system leaves no way to separate real reviewers from spinmeisters."
1,Old Spin - No news,"""A Vast Conspriacy"" is a boring resusitation of the so-called facts, i.e., spin put out by the Lanny Davis's and Jimes Carville's of the world. Clinton and his wife appear to be nothing more than passive players in this melodrama. Nothing is said regarding his outlandish claims of privilege, not knowing the meaning of alone, or is, or oral sex. Neither is anything said in regards to Clinton's management of his defense and what role if any was played by Hillary. This book is an embarrassment. Nor does it address Clinton's propensity to lie and his near total reliance on focus groups to determine positons."
1,"Another ""Spin"" Job",Toobin chooses to print the lies endorsed by Clinton supporters instead of the truth. Even a quick review of the facts of the case show the flaws in this book. Toobin is a man who served briefly in a U.S. Attorney's office and stole grand jury documents from Independent Counsel Walsh's office when he worked there.
1,Biased,"When I got to page 100, I was convinced this book was not unbiased. Toobin made Clinton a victim. It was a disappointment to read. I only wished I had waited a couple more weeks to purchase this book as it is now selling for half of what I paid!"
2,I reluctantly revise my previous review,"As comprehensive as it is, this book has already been revealed to contain several errors, one regarding Isikoff's journalistic practices, another (big one) regarding whether Lewinsky asked Tripp to lie. (Toobins says she didn't; the evidence suggests the opposite.)And there may be more corrections coming.This can still be a great book if the errors are addressed, but I advise readers to wait for a corrected future edition to come out."
3,Where is the love people?,"Are any of you shocked at the amount of vitriol in these reviews? I am not. The whole idea of unity is a crock. You choice is the devil, or the deep blue sea."
1,Lapdog,"Toobin is obviously another lapdog for the left. Anyone who thinks Clinton was the 'good guy' in all this is obviously part of the 'left-wing conspiracy' -- you know the one that has most of the media controled opinions/reporting in favor of poor, poor abused Bill. You know, the one that has people like Toobin who works for a liberal newspaper and news agency (ABC). I'd like to see an investigation in the voting records of America's media elite that pretend to be non-biased."
1,Calumny by Proxy,A tar and feathers piece with pretentions by a James Carville wanna-be dressed in an academic gown instead of the customary sheet.
4,Finally The Voice Of the People Is Heard,"This fair and balanced book was very insightful. It was a pleasure to read a balanced assessment of what most Americans feel about this subject. That is, what the Prez did was bad but what ""the Clinton-haters"" did to him was worse. A book for historians to read."
2,"Nice to watch, but NOT a good instructional.","Master K is awesome, no doubt, but this dvd is merely an overview of Muay Thai and not an instructional teaching aid. And, since it is very expensive as far as dvd's go, you would be real wise to look elsewhere. The instructional dvd's to get, in order, are Duke Roufus boxed set, Razor McCullough boxed set, and the ones by Saekson Janjira(volumes 1 & 2). All 3 are exceptional and the Razor McCullough 3 disc set is the same price as the Master K seminar dvd."
4,My kids LOVE this book!,"My six year old daughter was the one who picked this book out, but our 1 year old daughter loves it too. The bear puppet, which is made of latex and is totally adorable, is attached to the book. As you turn the pages, you work the puppet to pop into the next page. I would give it 5 stars for the puppet alone, but the story isn't too interesting. Perhaps if they made it a rhyming book it might be more exciting, but the puppet really makes it worth it. Its a favorite book around here, and will surely be a memory that my kids will look back on once they have grown."
3,3 stars only because of the sweaty latex puppet,The board book is great and remind me a lot of the puppet show books by Lisa LeLeu which as a quality plush hand puppet with liner and embroidered eyes. Also the hand puppet is removable! The stories are really cute and detachable. You can buy extra story starters online at http://www.PuppetShowBooks.comThe puppet theater look like book is great to express yourself not just our children. Many hours of fun for less than 20 bucks! I love to read this books too! These books are great motivators for children to become involved in literacy. I especially love the part where the child becomes the author of their own books.
4,Early Tom Hanks Movie about Young Love,"This is a WWII movie which takes place in Africa, with Tom Hanks playing an American who joined the RAF to be a figher pilot. He meets and falls in love with an eighteen year old girl (Christina Marsillach) named Sarah, who is apparently the youngest child in a large Jewish family.This is a very romantic movie, and I highly recommend it. If focuses on the relationships, and there are not a lot of special effects or shots of the beautiful country side. A VHS tape cannot do it total justice, but it is not to be missed, none-the-less. Let's hope for a DVD version in the future!"
1,Don't waste your money!!,I bought this and 3 of the ports stopped working in less than 36 hours. About the only thing i can say for it is that it arrived quickly...but so what.
1,Doesn't work with Lion/Mt. Lion,"Even though it says it will work with Mac OSX 10.4 and newer, that apparently only applied to 10.4-10.6. So Targus is now selling Hubs that won't work with Lion or Mt. Lion, the former having been out for over a year. I can understand not being able to support all operating systems, but if you can't support the current version, you shouldn't be selling it. I bought two of these and now can't use them at all. Shame on Targus for continuing to sell products that won't work with OS's that are over a year old."
2,"Good USB hub, short lifespan","While it works, this USB hub is great. However, my first one died within the first month of use. Once it was replaced by Amazon.com, it lasted 4 months. It seems that the culprit is the A/C adapter because when the hub dies no lights turn on at all. USB hubs are meant to last more than a couple of months specially since they don't usually move from the first place you put them at. Because of its short lifespan, I give this USB hub (Targus ACH81US) 2 stars."
4,Good hub,Works well without the extra power. Tossed several hubs over 3 year period. This looks like a keeper.
3,Work(ed) great for awhile,"Put six devices on this hub and performance was markedly improved over a prior hub. None of the USB devices were high power, so the load wasn't exceptionally high. After about six months, the computer started having issues, which I finally determined were caused by this hub when it totally died. Maybe this failure was a one-off problem, but it's worth noting the product is not bulletproof."
1,Piece of Junk of the HIghest Order,"This item is very poorly designed and will fail eventually. First you will notice that the powered port will quit working, and you will not be able to charge any device connected. Then the other ports will start to wig out. Your mouse may start jumping all over the screen, and then even things such as printing will fail."
4,"Good hub, but does not charge the iPad","I been searching everywhere to find a USB hub that can charge the iPad without giving the error message that it was NOT CHARGING.The truth is that it does charge, but much slower then if you connect directly to the Macbook Pro or newer iMacs. I had an older White iMac and it would not charge the iPad.Connecting it for 12 hours would charge my device about 50%.Using the double power port allows me to charge the device in about 10 hours or so, which is better then other USB hubs."
4,Works well. Data transfer is great.,"Bought this out of concern for speedy and continuous transfer of music files while DJ'ing. I was concerned my last USB was failing, so I researched and purchased this item.So far, it is working just fine. My only point is that I do not see a difference between the USB ports that are powered versus the non-powered ports. However, everthing is transferring with stability."
3,Savior of the Universe?!,"First off, I don't own this item. I gave it three stars because it still contains several of the songs that were in the movie, but the one I really wanted was the Flash Gordon Theme by Queen. Where is it? Not only was it in the movie but it featured prominently. This song alone was going to cause me to buy this soundtrack, and the fact that the song is missing has really turned me off from the whole thing."
1,Blades of Glory,"The soundtrack had only one song from the movie. The title, that's it, all the rest was talking and unknown artists. Very disapointing"
1,"Eh, not impressed.","For me, the only song worth owning on this album is ""Dance Sucka"" by T Ray, but they do not let you just purchase this particular track on MP3 (album only.) Ditto for iTunes as well.Not to mention the absence of ""Flash Gordon"" . Very frustrating."
3,Good book for collecting.,"This book goes well with some of the other Joey Green books that I have purchased. And, like the other ones they are a good reference to go back to."
5,Joey Green's Country Incredible Store,"I absolutely love this book. I bought one for myself and one for each of my 2 adult children. So many good ideas and facts. Fun and interesting reading. Many helpful ideas that I can try. Many good subsitutions for things that cost too much. I like natural remedies and this has many. I refer to it many times. Very helpful book, to add to my collection."
3,OK,"About: Recipes, facts and history about famous and nostalgic products.Pros: Interesting, easy read, short chapters. Includes resources and bibliographyCons: Writing can be repetitive. Brand names are used ad nauseam, which leads me to wonder if Mr. Green was being compensated by the trademark owners.Grade: B"
4,This Author always delivers.......,Barrett Tillman has written another great avaition book. He is a very capable and reliable author. This book really makes the carrier war come alive for me - the great build-up of US power that was eventually to swamp the Japanese empire in the Pacific. I am always left wanting more - so that must be a good sign!
4,Very thorough account of hellcat operations,"with lots of great photos, squadron stats, pilot accounts and totals of the aces. Unlike many Osprey titles this account doesn't cut corners and feels like a complete treatment of the subject matter."
2,Lack of infomation regarding the deaths of Hellcat Aces.,"The author stated that 20 Hellcat aces were among the 450 combat related losses. However, he did not go into further details or give more in-depth stories about those 20 Hellcat Aces. He mentions the deaths of three or four of the Hellcat aces but only in one or two sentences. It would have been better if Tony Holmes of the Hurricane Aces series had done the book about the Hellcat Aces."
3,A good read -- but not up to my expectations,"When I first heard about E. L. Doctorow's THE MARCH I was certain it would be my kind of book. The author's RAGTIME is one of my all-time favorite books, and I love reading about historical events. Civil War history is one area that especially interests me. Unfortunately, THE MARCH did not meet my hopes or my expectations.This is not to say that it isn't a good book. The stories and descriptions and the inter-weaving of plot lines that Doctorow performs so well make this book an interesting read. However, many times while I was reading this book I asked myself, ""why am I not as engrossed as I was when I was reading RAGTIME?"""
4,Some Rarer Songs To Be Enjoyed.,"Compilations of The Beach Boys are too many to number, therefore something diffirent needs to set this one apart from the the vast majority.Track 1 to 21 are in chronological order from 1962 to 1976, this is always a plus for me.The less known tracks are from the 1980s, Come Go With Me, Getcha Back, Rock 'N' Roll To The Rescue and finally a great California Dreamin', with Roger McGuinn providing Rickenbacker 12 string lead guitar!So 4 stars easily earned for this collection which was originally released in 1986."
3,A LITTLE UNEVEN BUT A GOOD INTRODUCTION TO THEIR MUSIC,"THIS WAS MY ""RE INTRODUCTION"" TO THE BEACH BOYS MUSIC BACK IN THE 80'S (PRIOR TO THAT, I HAD OWNED 'BEST OF THE BEACH BOYS). THIS COLLECTION INTRODUCED ME TO A LOT OF COOL SONGS THAT WEREN'T ON 'BEST OF' SUCH AS 'CAROLINE,NO','DO IT AGAIN','DON'T WORRY BABY'. THE ONE COMPLAINT AGAINST THIS COLLECTION IS THAT THE SONGS THEY PUT ON THERE FROM THE 70'S WERE NOT VERY GOOD AND THE BEACH BOYS DID A LOT OF GOOD STUFF IN THOSE YEARS TOO"
3,Too far fetched,Trainer's views for the new way in which society need to be shaped is the main idea that is relevent in this book. The only thing wrong with this book is that while his ideas are valid they are not really realistic in the current way of life. Good book just needs some optimsm when being read.
2,Too Simplistic,"having read the author's newer book, ""Investment Blunders"", I was disappointed. The book is simplistic, with little truly enlightening information. A book that covers many of the pitfalls, and supplies the reader with material of substance is William Bernstein's, Four Pillars. I would not spend money on this book."
3,It is OK -- won't recommend,"This book is not as good as other testimonials. It is a fair book but I was expecting more. This book basically says buy stock when others are in panic, i.e., go ahead against the crowd. That's the summary."
1,A Dull Book,"Reading this book was an absolute waste of my time and buying it was a waste of my money. It indeed pointed out how emotions and psychology adversely influenced an individual investor's decisions, but offered few if any solutions. Quite honestly, I found this book simplistic and childlike. Save your money on this one."
2,Fluffy and Cartoonish,"Full of cartoons, chapters of 3-5 pages in length with proportional content, lots of white space in between, with text ""call-outs"" and even with all that publisher effort at filler the book only manages 169 pages--and yet fully priced at (dollar amount) just like serious books on investing. No book on investment psychology yet strikes the best note--most are too dense--but this one is too simple (surprising that this author is a university professor)."
4,"Like a ""magic eye"" picture for your ears","Takes some digging, but will eventually reveal it's brilliance.""Bull Spears"" may be the most blistering rocker in the Pollard catalogue."
5,Value,"This product is a great value,and works quite well. As a telfa pad, I don't know what else that I would want."
4,The Food Doctor,"I have a lot of nutrition and healing books, but I like this one the best. The layout of the book is very colorful, and easy to read. The authors are concise and knowledgeable, and they make using the book very easy. There isn't a lot of confusing data or medical terms either. Instead the authors state everything very simply, and make it easy to understand for the average Joe or Jane. There is a list of the top 100 foods, and I have found it very helpful when changing my diet. This book also has yummy and easy to prepare recipies, as well as sections on various ailments and what foods to eat to help remedy them. I found this book to be a great information source in getting healthy and fit."
5,Great product,This tow bar is perfect I pulled my jeep 500 miles. It does require some fabrication to mount the brackets to a jeep bumper
3,Catchy but sometimes annoying.,"After hearing about this long lost MLWTTKK disco album, I went and picked up ""Gay, Black and Married"" and upon listening to it, have mixed feelings. While this is a catchy cd with tracks that will make you want to get up and dance, certain elements are a big disappointment. I like MLWTTKK because of their voice/movie samples that they so ingeniously incorporate in their songs. In that respect, this album does not disappoint. ""One Nite Stand"" has a good hard driving house beat with cool manipulation of voice samples. However, that meandering clarinet synth used in ""Euro-Freak Hustle"" is aggrevating. It takes a very hip gay disco album and turns it into cheese.If you're like me, you'll find this disc has some enjoyable moments, but just as it's getting good, Buzz and Groovie turn it into cheesy gay ""Blue Oyster Bar"" music. A series of buildups and letdowns."
2,"My second fav band after the Cure, but this can be skipped","I think it can be summed up with this: If you like TKK for albums like Confessions, then you may hate this one. If you like Sexplosion, you may be able to tolerate GB&M but it is < half as good. I have never put a disk in from TKK and not loved it, but this one.............?"
4,Very nice sturdy mug.,This travel mug matches my thermos and is a very nice looking and sturdy mug. It holds a lot of coffee and keeps it warm for quite a while. The only bad thing I have discovered is that the lid will slowly move the more often it is used. The hole to drink out of has moved about 2 inches to the left since I started using it. Other than that it is a sturdy mug that will take a lot of abuse. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fair priced travel mug.
2,think again,"Preheated cup, but it didn't hold heat for more than 3 hours in mid 30's temps while running errands. I had higher expectations, and they fell flat. Better off using the freebie from work--would have saved money."
1,Tippy-Tippy Syndrome!,"I've had this mug for a couple of years, and I just hate it. I'm actually surfing Amazon this morning looking for a replacement. When full, it's top-heavy, and the design virtually guarantees that it will tip over.Whoever designed this surely was never forced to use it. Any mug should be balanced, or at worst bottom-heavy to avoid tippy-tippy syndrome. Avoid this one!"
2,Thermos Work Travel Mug,I have several thermos mugs which are great but this one does not hold the heat as well and the top does not work as well or is not as spill proof
3,Thermos you were so close!,"I ordered this mug because it looks to be extremely durable in the photos, I figured the bottom would fit in my car's tiny cupholders, and the handle looks like something you could easily hold with gloves on.All of those things are absolutely true about this produce, hence the 3 star review. Unfortunately, the lid is a joke. When you screw the lid on tight the mouth hold is off from where it should be if you're holding the mug by its handle, and the little mechanism that opens/closes the mouth hole is very flimsy and difficult to operate.The other real PITA is that it costs half the price of the mug to send it back for a refund so I'll end up giving it to Goodwill. Lame!I would not recommend this. However, if they fix the lid I will buy another."
2,To Small,Got this as a gift for my husband and it did not hold enough. came a pert after only 8 months of normal use
4,great travel mug,"This is a great, sturdy 20 oz. travel mug. fits nicely into auto cup holders. unfortunately, if tipped over, the sipping hole doesn't fully seal, so just beware that juice or coffee may leak out. shakes aren't a problem, though."
4,great while it lasted,"I bought this mug for my husband, who needed a very large durable coffee mug. It was great for several months . . . and it broke the other day. It fell on the pavement from about 4 feet, and it did not survive the fall. So much for unbreakable! Also keep in mind that because the ""extra large"" section is at the top, it's top-heavy. It barely stands up when empty, and tips over easily when full."
3,"Nice, heavy mug","This is a good looking, heavyweight mug. It keeps coffee hot for about 2 hours. My only complaints are that it is too narrow to get my hand down inside to wash it really well and the plastic inside retains odors. I think it would be better if the inside was metal(stainless) like the outside. It does fit the cupholders in my car but is a bit top heavy."
2,Just fair,I was looking for something that would keep coffee hot until lunch (3-4 hours). This mug only keeps coffee hot for about 1-1/2 to 2 hours. You have to (by hand) screw the top on tightly or else it dribbles. The lid and interior are plastic; maybe metal would work better? I expected more from a Thermos product.
4,it works,20 oz is good enough for my coffee in the morning. had hoped it would have been a little more spill proof. it is sturdy and the price was also a good deal.
2,Where's the heat?,"I like the design of the handled travel mug. I am disappointed that it doesnt keep the liquids hot longer than 45 mins. The time it takes me to commute to work, my coffee need reheating. I plan to return it."
2,NOT SO PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT,I FEEL THAT COMPANY IS MISLEADING CONSUMERS ON HOW EASY ANDCOMPLETE THERE PROGRAM WORKS. I FEEL LIKE I WAS SOLD A TICKET TO ACIRCUS SIDE SHOW. THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE PROGRAM AND ALL THE COMPANY IS DOING IS TRYING TO SELL THERE WEB HOSTING SERVICE.
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"If you're looking for an album by the band that made the classic metal trilogy of Strong Arm of the Law, Wheels of Steel, and Denim and Leather, then look elsewhere. By 1985, THAT band had apparently been driven insane by their inexplicable lack of commercial success and decided to make a desperate stab at pop radio with this album. Although I can tolerate a few of these songs now that I'm old, the album as a whole is just flat out terrible and embarrassing. I am bewildered by all the rave reviews here, but even pop garbage has its fans. Unfortunately for Saxon, though, their fans in 1985 strongly disagreed with this new direction, and their prestige, along with the status they had managed to gain among metalheads, went in the trash for the next ten years. Recommended only for completists: there are at least ten Saxon albums you should own before this one."
5,NO OLIVER NO DAWSON NO EXCUSE,"BY FAR THE BEST SAXON ALBUM EVER! STEVE 'DOBBY' DAWSON'S LAST ALBUM WITH THE BAND AND SO FAR HIS FINEST MATERIAL. FULL OF CLASSIC SAXON TRACKS BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE LAST, PROVING DOBBY'S INFLUENCE ON THE BAND. THE CLASSICS 'ROCK AND ROLL GYPSY, BACK ON THE STREETS AND BROKEN HEROES' HAVE AND WILL ALWAYS STAND THE TEST OF TIME. UNFORTUNATELY THE BANDS SUCCESS AND POPULARITY WAINED AFTER THIS. HOPEFULLY, OLIVER/DAWSON SAXON CAN CONTINUE THE HITS FROM THIS POINT. UNFORTUNATELY THE LAST OF THE CLASSIC SAXON ALBUMS. A MUST!!!!"
2,My least favorite Saxon Album from the 80's,"I was a big Saxon fan back in the day and recently I just purchased the two box sets The Carrere Years and The EMI years. It was great hearing all of the albums again with exception of this one and Destiny. This was my least favorite one,of course with Destiny coming a close second. It's not bad when you're listening to the first couple of tracks but as I went further I realized that all of the tracks kinda blend together. Also I found the production of it to be pretty flat. Honestly there is nothing that really stands out for me on this album. If you're looking for some good classic Saxon I definetly recommend picking up The Carrere Years and not to bother with this one or the EMI years all together. Well maybe except for Rock the Nations, I have always had a liking for that one for some reason."
4,Great rock & roll metal style,"I have all of Saxon's cd's. This one has many catchy tunes Back on the Streets, the anthem, Broken Hero's, Gonna Shout, Raise some Hell and others. This one is a must for every die hard Saxon fan. The sound on this cd is a bit shoddy but I can live with it and sounds good enough. I especially like the cover of the cd, isn't she cute? Ha Ha, all kidding aside, go ahead and get this, you won't be sorry."
4,Good advice and info on meds.,"I loved 123-Magic, this was just as good with Dr. Phelan's down-to-earth style. I was concerned about meds for my ADHD child, but this tape helped me understand the benefits along with other great ideas to help my ADHD 9 year-old."
3,"Good story, but wheres the CHUD?","Good movie, I got this as a part of a movie marathon for my friends and I. They both loved it! Which Im happy about, but personally it just didnt do it for me. The story was very good, very interesting indeed. Its actually almost mystery-like. But that doesnt make up for the movie's one massive flaw for me, wheres CHUD??? CHUD monsters make 2, maybe 3 appearances throughout the whole movie. And those are SHORT appearances, and I mean really short like 5 seconds each. I really wanted to see some CHUDs killing people but there was only one or two good CHUD scenes in the whole film, it was mostly story. 3/5, good story and one or two good CHUD scenes."
4,Gettysburg,It's pretty hard to mess up the Gettysburg address. It was fine. I only gave it a 4 because it was a typed manuscript.
5,Good read on a sad time in American History,"I really enjoyed sitting back and reading this. It was not like High school when it was forced. It was not near as long as I thought it was, just short and to the point. You could tell Abe was a man who dearly cared about our country and was brokenhearted at what had happened. Made me proud of both sides, North and South. Everyone should have this on their Kindle just to look at on occasion. Enjoy"
4,Short and to the point,Mr. Lincoln proved himself to be a very intelligent man. He earned his place in history. It would have been much better if the book had given an entry of happenings up to the day and time of the speech. It would also have been interesting to read of the spectators and their considerations for the speech. The book is what the title says it is.
4,Good Book,Bought the book for my son for Christmas. It is a nice book he will enjoy. I thought it would be more about the speech but rather is just the speech with nice pictures.
2,What the...,"Great speech, but what happened to this formatting? The font is horrible, and if you try to change it, it stays the same. There's something wrong with the pages themselves- they overlap, and you can't get past the second page by touching the screen. Please fix this, Amazon"
4,Awsome,The Gettysburg Address I believe is awesome and has a great meaning to it. It is a must read for everyone.
4,Clasic,Great book. The Gettysburg address is classic American history and should be read by everyone. Book font could have been a bit better.
1,blah blah blah,i don't know about you but this one put me to sleep. I may try again but I honestly think I prefer Mad Magazine.
1,What a CROCK!!,"This book perpetuates the out and out LIES surrounding the Gettysburg address.This quote says it all...""The Gettysburg speech was at once the shortest and the most famous oration in American history... the highest emotion reduced to a few poetical phrases. Lincoln himself never even remotely approached it. It is genuinely stupendous. But let us not forget that it is poetry, not logic; beauty, not sense. Think of the argument in it.Put it into the cold words of everyday.The doctrine is simply this: that the Union soldiers who died at Gettysburg sacrificed their lives to the cause of self-determination -- that government of the people, by the people, for the people, should not perish from the earth.It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue.The Union soldiers in the battle actually fought *against* self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves.""--"
3,Just what you need...,"...this album is very good. keep in mind it is not a typical studio album. it's more of a 'collection' of tracks that either didn't make it onto the previously released albums, or maybe a different version of a previously released track(s) having said that; it flows well enough. after listening to it many times i start the album at track 3, skip 5,7, and 9. those aren't necessarily bad tracks, but i've been a fan for a long time and i know what i want to hear from them...so, those tracks aren't fitting my 'bill'...still, that leaves me 8 solid tracks to enjoy. the songs seem to be mixed well. i haven't had the chance to hear the cd through some really good speakers yet. i give it 3 stars...there's just some bands that put out really incredible stuff and 4, and 5 star ratings must be reserved for them in order to keep things in perspective...but there's some good stuff here!"
5,Just as Described!,"This was just what they say. Works fine, easy enough to install, and sealed up right away. The price is good for Fel-Pro quality."
2,Note that the translation (Everyman's Library) is abridged.,"(Ignore my 2-star rating, I had to put in something in order to get this review online.)As I cross-checked the passages that most interested me with the French edition, I was surprised to find that *entire paragraphs* are left out of the Everyman's Library English translation. Allan Bloom's translation is complete, and is also quite good. And it's available in paperback. Definitely purchase the Bloom translation instead of this one."
5,simple genius,i read this briskly for my childhood psychology class decades ago. i reread it this week. the author discusses his plentiful observations on raising a child. while some suggestions are really common sense / It is exciting to note how his observations formulated later child and developmental and educational theorists. As a psychologist AND as a dad / this is an essential resource and ought to be read by anyone who studies childhood or works professionally with children and parents. It is unduly wordy as is typical of the era. I give it a solid A and highly recommend it.
4,A good book with an excellent introduction,"This was a good translation of the book, though what really stood out was a thorough introduction. For Rousseau Scholars, Emile is one of Rousseau's major works: in part a treatise on education, we find in Emile Rousseau's illustration of a major theme -- man is intrisically good, but that goodness is beaten out of him from assorted external factors."
4,Hugely interesting,"A very, very interesting idea put into novel. It isn't so much about the fiction, more about the social ideals expressed through the narrative.Of course, it is also a product of its time and in some regards seems downright archaic because of it, but, if one understands the context, it becomes a truly enlightening (in every sense) piece of literature.""Emile"" is one of those works that really deserves being read slowly while carefully considering its concepts - if only to understand an important keystone of how educational science came to be what it is today. There are of course faults and Rousseau fails to live up to his own standards on more than one occasion, but if you are interested in education it remains hugely interesting."
2,Editing is horrible,"Although the scenes in the DVD are all beautiful, the editing is the worst I have seen in any travel films. The film shows, or more precisely flashes, constantly moving images so that a viewer may feel dizzy after watching it for a while. Most of the film is aerial photography, and as such, it lacks details. Sometimes I am wondering if this film was made by professional photographers and editors.On the other end, this set does offer more stuff than any other travel films on Italy. And the price is low, considering the length of this Blue-ray is 11 hours."
4,Absolutely beautiful!!!,"This DVD has gorgeous views of Italy. The one draw back, is that some of the words are written in Italian, and it is hard to make out what the narrator is talking about. But other than that, it is absolutely breathtaking, and well worth the money."
2,mmmm....poor,"I think it's a nice gift with a nice presentation, but once we watched the dvd it's was a little bit poor.I know italy very well and i have to say that this one it's like a ""museum"" description of the country, and you can not listen to native speakers talk in it's own language...you always have to do it in english...so sad."
1,Europe - London,"This is without a doubt the WORST informational dvd ever! The seller was great though, they refunded 20% of the purchase price."
2,ARE PISA AND VENICE IN ITALY ?,"LIMITED COVERAGE OF ROME,FLORENCE,NO COVERAGE OF VENICE,PISA,RIMINI AND LIDO DE JESOLOHAVE ORDERED DIFFERENT ""VIEWS OF ITALY"" HOPING TO COVER PARTS OF ITALY MISSINGHIGHLIGHTS OF ITALY WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA FOR FURTHER FILM MAKERS"
1,Magnificent italia,"It is OK for its price , but it doesn't like real blu-ray DVD quality . You only get what you paid for , never wrong.I waited for this order for very long time to receive as delivery is very ,very slow took 28 days arrive,and estimate delivery days even up to 43 days , generally Amazon deliver is faster than this . Contacted with Amazon online staff for explanation but they said it is very normal ! 43 days to delivery a DVD is normal ?"
5,Classic beauty,What can be said about the music of Les Baxter; he epitomized the depth of beauty in harmony and themes. This is the best therapy one can receive.
2,Run Away!!!,"If you want info now, don't buy this book. To get anything useful you have to read the whole the whole thing and do all the exercises. I prefer books that have many good clear examples that you can work through and learn from. I don't have time to use this type of book."
5,What was their label thinking?!!,"These guys were awesome, saw them at the U of U in concert with Neds Atomic Dustbin I think... Must have been in 1993... If you like Gin Blossoms, Toad The Wet Sprocket and The Ocean Blue This is a Must Have album... I personally did not like BEND as well and I think the label they were with must have thought the same. SAD..."
4,An interesting summary,"I was pleased to discover that this book has been reprinted. It is a well researched listing of shipwrecks along a particular secion of the U.S. Atlantic coast. Accounts are of varying length. In some cases the author gives extensive details, e.g., he devotes a chapter to the Steam Packet Pulaski, but in other cases the accounts are very brief, perhaps a long paragraph or a page. The author does provide a chronological listing at the end of the book, a detailed index, and descriptive drawings of the various types of ships along with a map of the area (which I hope was preserved in the latest edition)."
5,North Carolina,"As a native North Carolinian, I love everything OUTER BANKS! This was a look at the history of our coast."
4,"Easy,Powerful and Fast Hypnosis Training Program","If you want to learn how to Hypnotize someone, this is one quick and powerful Induction. Malik explains every detail so thoroughly that you cannot miss anything. The Program is about two hours and thirty minutes long, and I felt tired but something kept me glued to the seat, may-be I was Hypnotized. In fact I tried it on one of my friends the same evening. I did not do bad for the first timer!"
5,Best of the CINEMA releases,This is the best that CINEMA electronic music releases had to offer in the mid-eighties. Everyone of these songs has an interesting element to it - whether it be the keyboard or synthesizer work or the melody or effects that drive them. This was 'Dark Side' for the synthesizer enthusiast. Most of my friends in college liked this and wondered where it came from. For fans of Camel and Floyd (instrumental only).
4,cool tunes,I got this as a replacement for a cd I had yers ago and find it to be just as enjoyable as I did then.
4,a piercing spear,just finished the spear. well written. good historical novel.some confusion with quantity of characters but a minor problem. keeps interest thru out. well researched. cant wait for part 2.
3,The chapters are very uneven in understanding level,"The introductory chapters to the various CGI elements are very good even though written 3 - 1/2 years ago (thus previous to PerlEx). Some of the DOS screens needed a little introductory and conclusion text added to make them meaningful in context so I just penned it onto the particular book page. However, when dealing with the CGI complexities, e. g. , stateful programming, even though these are the most complex examples in the book, I kept looking for a different pedagogical approach that would make the examples in the book meaningful and relevant in context. I found that I had to re-write some of the example .pl scripts in that particular chapter to have them match the expected output printed in the text. Perhaps a second edition is overdue . . ."
3,Good book but you will need to purchase a Perl book!,"I like the concepts in the CGI Primer Plus for windows: I learned how to create an link generator, address book, email, and a survey interface using the book. The best feature about the 'CGI Primer Plus' is the number of applications in the book. The down side is the assumption the user knows Perl. I purchased the 'Perl 5 by Example Book'; read the first eight chapters, and dove into the 'CGI Primer Plus' book. The author's applications inspired to create numerous of my own applications. I'm very excited by the books value in terms of ideas and methods to apply perl. My wish list is to have a CGI book design for sybperl, Oracle, or Informix. Creating Database applications would be very valueable."
2,Random pieces of information with no apparent pattern,"Mr. Kabir's book is awful! He aims at a beginner-level audience, but he only presents scattered pieces of information. He uses Perl programming language in examples without introducing its features properly. He talks about CGI in introductory chapters without introducing terminology that is necessary to know in order to understand what is he talking about. The CD that comes with the book is damaged, and it's not just mine - it's the way they created it! Finally the number of typographical errors is way beyond acceptable. Want to learn Perl for CGI? Stay away from it!"
4,Worthy of your time,This book really helped me develop my skill at programming for the web. I would suggest also buying a separate book on PERL so that you can do more advanced stuff once this book has brought you through the basic and intemediate processes.
2,"Compared to Funland or midnights lair, Bite bit","Richard Laymon is horror genius, he always goes a step further, leading his works to be disturbingly entertaining. With Bite, however,his nack for making the unbelievable believable failed him.I still enjoyed it more than a king or koontz bore.Don't give up on laymon, he has a couple masterpieces out there, Ilook forward to discovering more of them."
2,One of his weaker books,I have read just about all of Richard Laymon's books. This one of his is the most recent one I have read and I was rather disappointed with it. Perhaps I have read to many of his books but they are beginning to blend all into one. The usual characters man/woman and the perverted characters they meet up with. It was nevertheless an ok read but definitely not his best.
2,What a load of........,"Laymon has written some very good books....this is definitely NOT one of them. It is so boring that I use it to put me back to sleep if I can't. Nothing much ever happens save the first few chapters. After that it goes nowhere.....slowly, VERY, VERY slowly. There semms to be no middle ground with Laymon's writing, the books are either really good, or they are REALLY bad. Bite is the latter. And this book bites. Now that he's dead I'm sure they'll release every book this guy ever wrote, deserving or not."
1,"This book ""Bite""s, all right.","Hated it! Where does this man's good reputation come from? Stephen King is an apparent fan but I can't for the life of me figure out why. I've read a few of his books now and found them to be boring, without even the slightest chill. His writing style is fine but where's the horror? This book is very similar to another Laymon novel called The Stake. He likes to write vampire novels where the reader spends the entire time wondering when the vampire is going to show up. Don't waste your valuable time on this one."
2,This Is Not A Vampire Novel,"If you are looking for a good vampire story, this book is a waste of time. It is actually an only mediocre thriller about a couple of people being chased around the desert by a psycho-type. The vampire in the story is virtually incidential, playing almost no role except in the very beginning and the end. BEWARE! This book starts promisingly with an interesting vampire premise, but it is soon dropped for the thriller story line."
3,"It was good, but not the vampire book I thought it was...","I was in a store when I spotted it... It sounded good, and I did enjoy it. It just wasn't a vampire fixated book like I hoped for. Don't let that stop you from reading it. It was very readable, and it kept me glued to each page. I'll definitely look at other books this author has written."
1,This is a vampire book?????,I was very dissappointed in my first read of Richard Laymon.Was this suppose to be about a vampire? Just because there was one in the trunk does not qualify this as a vampire book. I had high hopes as I kept reading waiting for the main characters to get down to business and stop lusting after each other. I wasn't feeling sorry for Cat as a battered wife. And Sam was alittle too whimpy. This one went into the trash as soon as I was done. I wouldn't dare pass this one on to a friend.
3,Not thrilled,"I have read several Laymon books. This book is one of my least favorites. It's supposed to be about a vampire - the vampire only serves to fill back ground material. Don't read this if you are expecting a horrific blood-sucking fest!I also felt Laymon's entire writing style was thrown off in this book - I noticed more than a few errors in the storyline.Most of Laymon's books are quick reads for me - this one seemed to pass even faster than other books (probably because I was bored and skimmed ahead instead of actually paying attention). If you're new to Laymon's work, I suggest seeking out a different title to read."
4,A gory good time,"Bite is one of those guilty pleasures, a book you pretty much figure you shouldn't be liking but once you let go of your prejudices and let the story take over, it's like a mad roller-coaster ride into the nasty places of the human mind. Briefly, boy meets old flame who needs him to kill a vampire for her. He does, and they spend the rest of the novel trying to get rid of the body. It's a horror novel, though not one that will scare you much, it's a road trip of the weirdest sort, and it's a comedy that is irresistibly spiteful, skirting the sharp edges of madness. This is not Stephen King, folks, this is the guy who runs the museum full of two-headed sheep and stuffed jackalopes. For lovers of flim-flam, the strange and the absurd."
2,"unfortunately this book ""bites""",This book had an OK beginning and a good ending. Everything in between was pretty bad. I've read a few novels by Laymon now and this is the first one that I thought was really bad. The dialogue (as other people have said) is terrible. Some of the conversations between the main characters are redundant and unrealistic. The plot of the novel isn't terrible but it isn't great either. I wouldn't recommend this novel. It was not an enjoyable read. It just goes to show that you really can't judge a book by its cover.
2,Disappointing,"I've heard good things about Laymon, but apparently they weren't said because of this book. There's some potential here (is the ""vampire"" real, where Elliot came from, characters ""becoming"" vampires themselves), but it's squashed by inane, repetitive dialogue, a dull ""hero,"" baffling decisions by our leads (when to kill a 12-pack for instance), randomly occuring villains, and a dash of misogyny. Disappointing. I really hope to come across a book that justifies Laymon's good reputation."
2,Not at all what I expected,"Although the book kept me reading it was only because I wanted to get rid of it as quickly as possible. The horror and terror in the book are minimal, and the chracters are simple and rather one-dimensional. Some of the twists and turns are interesting, but if you are looking for a good vampire thriller, or chilling horror story look elsewhere."
2,ok but info is not organized well,"The strength of this book is that it describes fairly well external features in the environment and how they affect the feng shui of the house. However this only covers eight mansion style, not flying star feng shui. The weakness of the book is that the information is not organized well and is confusing to decipher, especially if it is the first feng shui book you read. When so many other excellent books on compass feng shui are currently on the market there's little reason to consider getting this one."
1,Very shallow collection of notes,"It is obvious that the book is a collection of material that was done for classroom teachings. There are many references to later books or other material outside the book which are not available (at least not on amazon). The content is as such is most probably correct, but I hope that there are better books on FengShui out there."
1,the principles of feng shui,this is the 2nd book i have read related to this subject and i found this one hard to understand. I don't have a LO Pan for one thing and the constant use of chinese symbols that i cannot read were unnecessary. I just found the whole thing confusing.
1,Item shown not item shipped,The picture shown in the ad was a solo seat rack not a 2 up rack that was shipped.I had to ship the rack to the company (Motherwell) to get it changed to a solo rack as was shown in the picture on Amozon.This cost me $16.00+ in shipping.I was NOT pleased with your service.Will NOT order again!Had it not been for the nice people at Motherwell I would be stuck with a rack I could not used.Julian Smith
4,Read it for Anna,"Despite its bizarre and even roughshod ending, Coetzee's The Master of Petersburg is a thrilling, although difficult book to read. Coetzee's Dostoevsky is compellingly rendered, complex and rich in his observations of human life.But it is the inn keeper, the widow, who really steals the show. Anna is Dostoevsky's unexpected lover, and each time he is with her, ""he finds something new and surprising in her."" She becomes the counter-point to Dostoevsky's sense of loss and turmoil. A woman who can, despite her setbacks in life, still see the hope and glimmer of transformation in things; yet she sees reality for what it is, and experiences it fully.The relationship between this enigmatic woman and the master of Petersburg is reason enough for reading this well-crafted novel. Coetzee writes complex, psychological and philosophically driven novels, and The Master of Petersburg does not fail on either front."
3,Not his best,"Coetzee gives a pronounced yet creative bending of the arm to Dostoevsky. A nuanced piece, it works rather nicely as a companion piece to ""Demons."""
3,Rather difficult to read,"After the death of his stepson Pavel Isajev, Fjodor Dostojevski returns to St. Petersburg to say farewell and to find out the true cause of his death. He meets Pavel's landlady and her unpleasant daughter and he also finds out that things are not the way they seem to be: Pavel's death (he had fallen to his death) is less clear than it appears. Fjodor finds out that Pavel was part of the entourage of the vague, anarchistic Netsjajev, who now also wants to use Dostojevski. The police suspects this and sends a police spy who is dressed as a beggar to see what Dostojevski is doing while in St. Petersburg. And in the meantime Dostojevski has to come to terms with the unexpected death of a son that he loved dearly, but that did not love his stepfather in return.I read the book while in St. Petersburg and the Russian atmosphere is very well described, but all the main characters, side characters and psychological twists and turns do not make this book very easy to read."
3,And in the final chapter you ask whaaat?,"In most of the literary journals they tell us that Dostoyevsky use a lot of its own sufferings and personal difficulties to draw its characters on the novels, but here, the author using that premise as support of its book, show us a person who lacks any clear understanding of its own motivations and that revolves around ideas without reason or rime. I believe that is why in last chapter is like a sketch of an ending and makes no sense at all, because the author lost track of what he wanted to portray."
1,Not worth it!,"Don't spend money on this book, I was very disappointed when I got this book. It does not have as much information as what is expected. It cost too much for the little information it has. If this book cost me $20.00 I still would have been disappointed but not as much, the saying ""you get what you pay for"" does not stand true for this book. It has many pictures but none of the house plants I own. You will wonder why it cost so much. It's a good book if you know nothing about house plants and want to spend alot of money. After I got this book I got The Complete Houseplant Survival Manual, it has more info in it. Encyclopaedia of House Plants is really not worth the money. I would feel guilty if is sold this book for or around the price that it is going for. I would really feel like I was ripping someone off."
3,My Lid Handle Fell Off Too,"All in all, this has been a decent crock pot, however, I agree that food cooks too fast. Whenever I have cooked food for even the shortest time recommended, food is almost always scorched on the bottom.I read another review about the handle coming off the lid. Mine did too. I lifted the lid to check and stir my food, and the handle broke off, causing the lid to splash into the crock pot. Luckily I wasn't burned, but I could've been. I called customer service, and although I was out of warranty, they told me if I cut off the plug and sent it in, they would send me a whole new crock pot. It seemed kind of wasteful to me--I didn't understand why they couldn't just replace the lid. So I had to put the old (still functioning) crock pot in the trash.I am now researching crock pots for my mom. Between cooking too hot, and a potentially hazardous lid, I think I'll try something better."
2,Very disappointed in the quality,"Rival is the ""original"" slow cooker that has been around since at least the 70s. I bought this model a couple of months ago to replace an older model. I thought by purchasing the original ""CrockPot"" I would be getting the best slow cooker on the market. I am sorry to say the quality really seems to have gone down considerably compared to my model from ten years ago. After only a few uses the outside of the stoneware insert began crazing. Now the paint is almost completely crazed on the entire stone crock. The outside of this model also gets very hot, even on the warm setting. I am pleased with the way it cooks but will probably purchase a different brand next time due to the poor quality of Rival's product."
4,Smart-Pot Crock-Pot,"I have used this crock pot multiple times since receiving it. Every time I have been extremely pleased with the results. I like the removal lid. I like the times available to program on high and low. I recommend this pot highly. Never has any food stuck on the bottom. The outside does get hot, that is the only drawback I have found with this crock pot."
1,HORRIBLE CROCK-POT,"HORRIBLE. This is not a slow cooker crock-pot. The temp is way too high, food cooks way too fast. Soups should never each a boiling point (on the low setting) within the first half hour of being turned on. I've ruined several meals trying to work this crock-pot. I contacted Rival about the problems I was having and was told this is just how they're made now...it kind of defeats the purpose of being a slow cooker. It's not safe to turn on, even on the low setting and leave it."
2,Rival's lid handles break!,"The same thing just happened to us - we've used our crockpot a little over a year and last night the handle just pulled right off the lid! The glue or plastic just crumbled into little pieces, like it got too hot for it or something. Rival's warranty won't cover it since it's over 12 months old and the lid is $10 plus $8 S&H. That's why we're looking at getting another one, but not Rival. Buyer be warned!"
4,Great Product,I just love my progamable crock-pot. It is so easy to use and save me so very much time and effort.
1,Money down the drain.,"My son had bought this Rival Smart Pot and let me borrow it. I had trouble the first time I used it and the the third time I could not program it. All the lights just kept flashing,a piece of junk!!"
3,This thing is HUGE,"This is one of the largest crock pots I have ever seen. Since I like to make big pot roasts and huge batches of sloppy joes it is great! I never have to worry about needing more space.I haven't noticed any hot spot or burn issues like some people have commented on. My only issue is it has a ""timer"" instead of a temperature control. I'm never 100% sure if my food is going to be cooked properly. Does 4 hours cook twice a hot as 8 hours? Since I've never had a problem with undercooked or overcooked I just keep on going. I just wish I had a better understanding of that feature."
2,Fast Cooker,"I wish I'd read the reviews more carefully when I bought this. It burns or overcooks everything I put in it.I just ordered a Hamilton Beach to replace this Rival. The Hamilton Beach had almost all 5 star reviews.Stay away from this one.The last straw was last weekend when I used this Rival to make corned beef & cabbage. On LOW heat, the corned beef was so overcooked it fell into shreds. The potatoes, carrots and cabbage were cooked to mush and I added the vegetables much later in the cooking cycle."
1,"""dumb pot""","This looks like a great crock pot with multiple times and warming. If you use the amount of liquid called upon, it burns the meat. If you add enough to cover the meat, it cooks ok, but the meat does not come out moist. As others have said, it cooks too hot. I traded my first one for another thinking just a lemon - nope, same for the second.Do not buy"
2,cooks too quickly,"I love the way this crock pot looks, and I like the fact that it is programmable, but mine cooks way too quickly. I use crock pots often, and I own two others (Rival brand also). They cook exactly as they should but when I put food in this pot, the side on the back of this one will actually burn while the front side will cook to perfection. If you are at home, I guess the remedy would be to turn the lining crock around halfway during cook time, but if you need to be away, this one will burn your food. I have always been very happy w/ Rival products, but this particular one is a dud."
1,Don't waste your $$$ on this pot of disappointment!!!,"We received this crock pot for a wedding gift. I was really excited because I remembered my mother making lots of slow cooker meals while I was growing up. During the first month we were married I tried to use the pot but ended up with an over cooked, burned mess! I was very disappointed and figured it was because I was a newly wed and had little experience preparing meals! Here we are 5 years later and my cooking has much improved, but the pot has not! Every recipe I have tried has ended up over done and burned around the edges. I have tried various recipes, meats, veggies and tried using the different time settings. Nothing seems to help! This product cooks way too hot! I thought maybe we received a faulty model where the thermostat is set too high, but after reading other people's experience I think it is just poorly designed. I will be looking for a new pot that actually cooks slowly. What a disappointment from Rival!"
2,Too hot,"I was excited to get this beautiful crock pot last Christmas. But after cooking with it for a year, I'm looking for a new one this year. I have had extensive trouble getting the temperature regulated on this unit. It seems to boil nearly everything I put in there.I'm glad a whole group of people have had great success with this model; perhaps I (and a whole other group of people) got lemons. Who knows?But I don't trust this model anymore."
5,Great Read....,"This is a great read for the disciple of Christ. It does have Baptist overtones, but Gordon is a devout Christian with an almost prophetic message to today's church."
2,Sizes are weird...,I bought these shoes in a 7 and they were WAY too big and I wear a 7 in everything else. Then I bought a 6.5 and one shoe was still WAY too big and the other was kind of snug...They looked great but they must be factory rejects at this price...especially with the horrible sizing...
3,Should be better for the money,"This items build quality is great, but because the pages are stitched into the case it does not give the option to remove or add pages to it."
4,good value,nicely made album with plenty of storage space. Not too large so it is manageable to handle and locate cd's. I use it for photo storage making it a great item to keep my files in an orderly manner. Price with free shipping was great.
4,works as advertised,Product seems to work just fine as advertised. Zipper seems to get sucked in and is a pain to retrieve it after you close the book. Other wise it seems to work just fine.
5,BIG CASE,"This is just a BIG OLD CD CASE. I mean, it's huge. It's a really great value but is by no means compact. Don't underestimate its size."
4,Excellent CD Storage Unit,I highly recommend this CD or DVD storage unit. The quality of the handle tells one that this is a well made product.
4,If only the zipper was longer,I really like this case except for the short zipper. It makes the case hard to open and sometimes the zipper catches on the inside pages. We have over 1200 CDs and 500 DVDs in cases similar to this so moving them around at 300+ at a time can be made easier with some of the smallest details.Pros:Most comfortable handle on a DVD case I have foundSolid construction.Good ValueCons:Zipper issues are a real problem once the case is loaded.Pages are not removableWon't buy again.
5,DVD case great.....,"This case is just great. It holds so many dvds. I am so happy with it, that I need to buy another one. I highly recommend this product. It is very well made."
3,It Is Fine for our Purposes,This works just fine. It hold a lot of DVDs. It's kind of tricky to zip but it's not that big of a deal.
2,"Good Product, BAD SHIPPING","Ordered The case on May 5th, and just received it today on June 8th. After 3 weeks of waiting, I tried to contact datavis 3 times, both by email and phone. I didn't get a response until I threatened to have my credit card company get my money back. They still didn't contact me, but instead sent out another automated order confirmation email with a tracking number in it. It would have been nice to get it on time, but now that it's here I'm happy with the quality. I don't think I would buy from them again."
5,Citygear 320 CD case,Good sturdy CD/DVD case. Pages turn easily unlike some cases. This is my 2nd one. They are becoming harder to find. WalMart and Target used to carry them but no longer do. Too bad because the ones WalMart and Target have now are flimsy and the pages inside are cheap!
4,DVD Case,"I purchased this case to hold the backup copies of most of my DVDs. So far, I haven't even filled it up half-way. It has a great deal of space and a nifty handle with which to tote the DVDs around. The pockets are a bit difficult to use. I don't like to get scratches or smudges on my disks and this case makes that difficult. It would be nice if you could just use one hand to insert the disk. However, it is a very good-looking and sturdy case. One major drawback is the sleeves cannot be replaced if they fall out, become damaged or worn."
2,"Good idea, poor execution","We had this CD case for a few months and had it about half full before the handle broke (it's hard plastic, not fabric with rubber on it like most large cd binders/cases, so there was a screw sticking out of the case once it broke). The sheets hold DVD's or CD's just fine, but closing it can be a pain in the butt because the fabric doesn't easily align at the top-it tends to flop inwards. The exterior fabric is durable, but that's about it. Don't waste your money on this. OfficeMax has a similar case for less money that's better made, and Case Logic makes a similar one that is superior as well."
4,One extremely small concern,"I love almost everything about this carrier - I have 2 of them - but the zipper could be better. When the case has been opened all the way, it's sometimes difficult to get the zipper started when you go to close it. Other than that, they're great! Very solid construction! My movies used to take up many shelves (all of those plastic dvd cases!), but now they are contained to a very small space. I just keep a list tucked into the front of the case, with the movies listed alphabetically (which I update occasionally)."
3,Zipper needs improvement,I purchased this item based on several reviews. All I can say is that the zipper to open and close the CD/DVD case could be improved. It's not smooth at all and quite often gets stuck. It seems very cheap and flimsy. The Case Logic cases never have this problem. I will buy Case Logic over Targus in the future.
4,Does the Job,"Not the highest quality; but nothing has ripped yet, so that's a plus. We'll see how it holds 240 cd, hopefully no pages fall out.Nick"
5,Get this one!,"So sturdy and well made, especially compared to what I could find at all the local big box stores. Very happy with this purchase!"
3,Targus CityGear 320,"The product seems durable, fits well on the book shelf near the dvd player so it's convenient, and it holds up to 320 discs. Each compartment holds the disc comfortably and I've been able to slip a portion of the cover picture/title in front so we can find the dvd easily. The only problem is the same one others have already reported...it's the zipper. It is a little tricky to move. It sticks at different places so you have to really take your time opening and closing it. But overall, it's better than most that I've seen in stores around town."
2,Flimsy Pockets,The inside pockets are made of flimsy clear plastic material. It's going to be only a matter of time before they tear.
2,Probably would not have bought it in a store,"The case is inexpensive enough and serves its purpose but the zipper is poorly designed. It doesn't open far enough to allow you to open the case flat on a table. I'd say it opens about 140 degrees before it's stressing the zipper at the end of its travel. I probably would not have bought this case if I had examined it in a store, but for under $30 I wasn't going to bother returning it to the on-line vendor."
2,not sturdy enough,"this case looks fine and the sleeves are ok, but after i packed it with dvd's and picked it up, the handle came offon one side. now i have to hold it in my arms."
3,Ok case,It is ok for the purpose it was intended for. The plastic sleeves could be a bit stronger than they are. It holds alot though!
4,Great for condensing DVDs & CDs!,I love that I can store my DVDs in a durable case. The case makes organizes discs easy. I would purchase more if needed!
3,Capacity CD,"This product fulfilled my need to storage space with more than ample, however, it was not as substantial as I was expecting. It will not last long if it is tossed around in the backseat or trunk of a vehicle. Also, if heavy items are accidentally placed on top, I believe the case will not be of much protection for my CD's DVD's."
3,Good but not for regular use of DVDs,"Generally the reviews were stellar, so I purchased this as a gift for my father. He's an avid collector of DVDs, and his Dr. Who collection had homes in multiple cases. What better brand for a Dr. Who collection? The album itself is of very high quality. The only thing that really lost it stars was the highly disappointing lack of side-loading sleeves. It has top load sleeves with the small tab that overlaps once the DVD is in place; this causes minor scratches over time with removing and replacing your DVDs if you aren't careful to slip the plastic tab over the top of each DVD. Unfortunately the Dr. Who is almost always on marathon mode, so unless my father is constantly fiddling with those plastic tabs, the DVDs will have to be replaced sooner than staying in its own case. Otherwise, again, excellent product for the price, but only if you rarely watch items in your collection."
3,Its Okay - Zipper is Hard to Work,The quality of this CD/DVD Album is great except for the Zipper being hard to get at when fully closed or opened. It hides itself almost. The shell looks and feels like it may last for years of protection - but the zipper struggles may make all that moot. If you are strapped for money - like myself - then go for it. Its a small inconvienience and holds a lot of DVDs.
5,DVD Album,I pay a little more than other albums available because this one is lasting quite a long time under repeated use. I continue to purchase this same album because I have tried others and this has the quality I am looking for.
5,DVD Case,This is a great product. I have actually purchased 4 of these cases now. It is a quality product that should last for years and years.
5,Great classic origami book.,I used to borrow this book from the local library when I was a kid; I taught myself origami from the book. Now I bought it for my great-niece who is fascinated by folded paper figures. The book is over 60 years old but it's still a classic.
5,Saxon's best album,Wheels of Steel is the terrific sophomore album from one of the best rock groups of the eighties.This album features some of their big hits like the trtle track and Motorcycle man.Highly recommended.
4,Wheels of Steel,"I've been a Saxon fan - really the first seven albums - since about 1981. It is refreshing to listen to vocals and music that retain the realism of music that hasn't been polished to the point of unrecognizability. I was thrilled to find CD replacements for my vinyl and cassettes. (Those were the things on which old-timers listened to music, they weren't even digital).Wheels of Steel, the bands 2nd album, had two big hits as I remember it, ""Motorcycle Man"" & ""747 (Strangers in the Night)"". These remain my two favorite songs from this album. Suzie Hold On follows closely behind. I like the whole album. But these three songs went into my ""Best Of Saxon"" file. Wheels of Steel ranks at #5 on my Saxon top 7 albums."
5,The Treasure Chest by Wallis,"A marvelous book! I have bought and given away five or more of them. I wanted to share, especially the spiritual messages. I intend to buy some more to send to friends to whom would surely profit from the reading. It was given to my husband and I from a very special friend as a Christmas gift."
2,Scissors,The book cover was in excellent condition; however 15 or more quotes through out the book had been cut With scissors!
3,I Can't Figure Out What This Book Wants to Be,"I have nothing but respect for the late Mike Yaconelli, but can't figure out what this book wants to be. Its basic premise is the Good News that that we are all wretched sinners and are saved only by Christ's Blood. Amen. But who is the target audience? The ""pretenders"" that act perfect in spite of their wretchedness? Those who recognize their sin, but have difficulty recognizing that Christ understands our unavoidably sinful nature? On one hand, he bad mouths and beats himself up for his own sins throughout the book, and on the other hand, parts of this book read like a ""hall pass"" to go ahead and sin. There can be no doubt that we should not be pharisaical, but we also should not take sin lightly. Thank goodness the book is a rather short read and was occassionally amusing, as it did little to affect my life."
2,Redundant and too long,"The first 25% of the book strongly makes a good point that needs to be aired, repeatedly, today.The rest of the book reiterated the same point over and over and over and over. This isn't a long book, but it was way too long anyway."
1,The Book is Blasphemous,"I read this book as part of assigned reading for a class in Community Spiritual Formation and was very disgusted with it. It is the worst book I have ever read. My problem with the book is based on his total distortion of the plan of salvation provided by God through Jesus Christ. He glories in the imperfect and corruption of life and makes that the normal experience for the Christian. This is an example of the false theology produced when ones experience is the basis of truth. When the Bible is quoted is often twisted out of context. On other times is it intentionally misrepresented to support his false conclutions. The words, ""I think"" are used to often as support without any Biblical support. I hope no one will buy this book."
4,It's Okay If You're Screwed Up!,"This title is a refreshing change in Christian living literature. Many, many books tell us how we should live -- this one tells us it is okay with God if we are still somewhat screwed up, even after being born again. The author helps the reader how to deal with the blemishes in his Christian life, struggles and sins that don't disappear with spiritual regeneration. I loved this book, but I only gave it four stars because it could have been longer and provided more of its invaluable content."
4,Interesting Concept,I purchased 5 of these books for my book club and we are all excited about the discussion the books produce. It is easy reading but thought provoking. Would recommend for others.Kate Junging
5,Messy Review,"Am not a book critic but I love God, I love truth and I love this book. This book jumps off the pages and screams ""THIS IS THE WAY WE SHOULD BE!!"" This book taught me that I will never be a perfect Christian only a human loved by God and trying my best to love and obey Him. I am who I am and God created me that way."
3,"Good content, Touch Voice","The book has a lot of good ideas and good content. The fact that we are all messy and that being truly spiritual is messy is a great message. I mean Christians are not perfect by any means.The chapters are a bit long for my taste, but Yaconelli kept the sub-sections in the chapters a bit more manageable. The book is to the point and doesn't stray off topic too much.The toughest thing for me while reading this book was overcoming Yaconelli's voice. It's tough to express, but sometimes the way he states things to me seem skewed even though I know he means well."
5,Gotta go with the crowd on this one....,"Amazing book. Yaconelli writes some of the best stuff, I would reccommend reading ""Yak Yak Yak- Mike Yaconelli's Guide to Jerk-Free Christianity"", if you can get your hands on this out of print gem. This book always brings me back to what the Bible really teaches- that God loves me no matter what. I attend a Christian College, and see some people who, in the name of acting ""Christian"", are missing the whole point of our vital, living faith. I wish I could buy copies of this book for all!"
5,Messy Spirituality,"Just what I needed to hear. This book was referred to me by a pastor friend because I kept spouting off my ""spiritual rebellion"" against the status quo. If is encouraging to read a prominent voice in our culture having had the same inner struggles with how we do things in the church. As much as we want to make everything ""fit""...it just isn't that easy nor was it ever supposed to be."
2,"Funny, but unkind","Entertaining, but not the way to live your life. His stories seemed contrived to make his case. I did not think this book was about how to be a Christian."
4,Good book!,Overall a good book. It made me see some areas in my walk with Jesus that I needed to be more real.
5,So inspiring,"I love this book. You don,t have to be perfect to be spiritual. And it tells you that God sees the little things you do that are meaningful, which do mean a lot. You can be a follower of God just by being who you are."
4,Messy Spitituality,"Great book for the new or more mature Christian. Easy read. Also wondewrful read for any Christian in any recovery program. Best read with a highlighter, and good for a second read."
2,eh,"The sentiment behind this book is good, but Yaconelli's actual points could be addressed in one chapter. I think this would be more useful to someone who is new to the faith. On the other hand, this might not be so great for a new believer because Yaconelli at times comes close to simply condoning sinful behavior (though at other times clearly does not). My small group went through this together, and most of us regretted it to some extent."
5,Messy Spirituality,This is an excellent book. I have appreciated it greatly and as a youth pastor have been very pleased with the impact it has had on the group of students that are studying it together. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is struggling to live out an authentic spirituality and faith in the real world.
3,Nice overview,"The title is a little misleading. It offers a nice general overview of option trading strategies, but don't think that you can watch this DVD and start making money.A better title would have been , ""Highlights of Options Fundamentals"". Buy the DVD along with other books and hunker down and learn for a few months before you start investing with real money."
4,Very Good - For the Price,"If I had spent the $65 listed on the cover for this I would've been highly POed. It seems like they just videoed one of those seminars put on around the country by the Options Industry Council. That said, this video is a BARGAIN at $13.Contrary to the title, I would not recommend this as a person's first introduction to options. He glosses over the intro stuff more like a refresher. I do a little retail option buying now and then so I know the basics and I ended up taking several pages of notes while watching this. It is a good intro to the Greeks.I found his coverage of bull call spreads very interesting. I knew about them but didn't know that time decay can be a benefit with them. I also got a solid understanding of Gamma and was surprised to hear that, unlike Delta, it decreases as an option gets further in the money.The way I see it, you invest a chunk of change trading options and if you learn one thing from this video it'll probably save you many times the $13."
4,Enjoyable,"Heart Song was a bit plodding, but fortunately the action picks up in this book. Melody gets the answer to her long sought-after paternity after finding out that her mother isn't dead after all. This book isn't the best, but it's still pretty good at a solid 4/5 stars. Several deaths spot this book, but they feel rather convenient in the scheme of the plot, so this read is a bit light compared to previous series. Still, this book is a decent read."
3,"good plot, irritating family","Melody travels alone to LA to track down her allegedly dead mother, and her disillusionment made for a good realistic read. I was also horrified by the secret revealed about Laura at the end of the book. Good plot, but I found most of the female characters irritating. Dorothy lived in a fantasy world, Haille was unbelievably selfish and irresponsible, and Grandma Olivia had a stone where a heart should have been. Sara was sweet but so wishy-washy. And no matter how kind Holly was, she shouldn't have tried to sway Melody from tradition with her stupid crystals and astrology. But Carey and May were such stable, loveable characters when Melody needed them most, and Melody herself showed real growth."
2,Not the best book in the Logan series,"This book did not get interesting until about the middle. The first half was just endless, boring descriptions of Melody's trip to L. A. and the search for her mother. Maybe Melody was in denial, but I thought she was way too naive. I kept thinking uh, Mel? Your ma ditched you. Even if she does want you back, she doesn't deserve you. I think it was readable, but V. C. Andrews would not have been impressed."
3,good.....not great,"Becoming accustomed to V.C. Andrews wonderful works has left me a bit disappointed in this book. Although I did enjoy it I didn't think that this was the best of this authors long time legacy. I was introduced to this author by my Mother and having read nearly every book written by her and her ghostwriter, I must express my disappointment. However I do look forward to reading the other great books to be writted in the future by Andrews."
5,Absolutely mind blowing.,This book was so great. i couldn't put it down and comming from a high school senior that's very unsual. if you like books with alittle myster and alittle sorrow this book is for you.
4,Confusion,Im a little confused. In several of the earlier books there was a small page that said that V.C. Andrews had passed away. While later the pages stopped showing. Okay fine. Then they started showing up again in the more recent books. Is she alive? Well... anyway I am enjoying this series although it doesn't seem like any of the other V.C. Andrews books. The style was different and the ending was not what I was used to.I have also noticed that this last series has covers of bright colors and borders where the older books have dark plain covers. Is this a change for the purposes of asvertising or is it because of a new writer? I also read the description of Music in the Night. Either you have let too much information leak in your description or you meant Melody Logan. Laura is dead. Either way I will be waiting for the arrival of the new book.
1,Poor translation and innacurate details,1. The book appears to have been tranlated from French to English very poorly. I estimate 80% of the sentences have obvious grammatical errors and/or mispellings.2. Many of the detailed facts specifically in the timeline section are innacurate.3. I intended to use the book for research on Spec Ops role for an Afghanistan Campaign analysis. I didn't use anything from this book because it lacked factual credibility.
2,Not Comfortable to Wear,"I have owned a Lowepro Mini Trekker Classic for about 4 years and love it but I thought I'd like to try one of the newer bags from Lowepro so I ordered the SlingShot 300. The bag was very nice with plenty of room for my gear, probably similar in size to my Mini Trekker and like all Lowepro products, was very well made. However I just couldn't get comfortable wearing this bag. I learned that I much preferred the way the straps of my Mini Trekker fit around each shoulder than the way the one big strap fit across my chest. I think it may be much more comfortable for a man than a woman."
4,Lowepro 300,"Gave it 4 stars because of only limited ownership time. Worked great based on one or two uses. I think that I will eventually use two camera bodies and the size seems adequate for that. Workmanship is excellent and the backpack sling setup is quite comfortable.Caveat: As of April 2012... Bag is durable, heavy, and WILL NOT support two camera bodies..To keep everything with you in the car, it is great... If you gotta carry it, it's heavy...Lowepro is good quality stuff, but bigger is not necessarily better..."
4,Lowepro Slingshot 300AW,Great camera bag. I have used it for almost a 2 months and has performed wonderfully. I have even had to use the all weather feature a time or two already and keep everything dry. Only downside is the top compartment isn't as big as I had originally thought. This is strictly a camera bag. There isn't room to take at small laptop or change of cloths.
4,I wish,I love this lowpro but wish it had valcro or some way to carry a monopod or trypod.YES I WOULD BUY IT AGANE OR TELL A FREND TO
5,Camera Bag,"The mderchandise was great; HOWEVER, attempts to get the rebate met in total frustration. I had the merchandise, yet I was being told my order weas not processed????? I'd sure have to be in a teriffic bind to order items this way again. I thought AMAZON was great - BUT - It does make you wonder."
4,Slingshot III,"I very much like the quality of this item. It is quite well made. I also like the layout for the camera equipment and that it has a small storage area at the top for various items of use. I like that it is waterproof also.The only thing I don't like is the single strap. This idea appealed to me and I think it is a good one for the smaller versions, but I have 13lb of camera gear to haul and it is simply too heavy for the single strap idea, even with the waist belt in use. This would be a perfect bag with two straps (and the belt) but then it wouldn't be a ""slingshot"" would it.If the load was kept down to eight or nine lbs. it would be better, but then you could probably use the ""slingshot"" II. Other than that it is an excellent product."
2,We didn't get along with each other,"I see some reviews saying that the gear is ease to access and think ""I must be doing something wrong."" I found it ok to access the camera if you put it in the bag as displayed in the ad photos, with the big lens attached. If you keep a regular lens attached and only need to attach a telephoto some times, it gets complicated. I usually have to open the bag almost completely to get one lens that is deeply located and I got scare to have something falling. Probably I picked the wrong bag for whht I had in mind: a bag that allowed me to quickly and safely change lens. I'm thinking about changing it by the Reporter D400 AW, since it seems to be thought for quick gear access.Talking about quality, the bag's structure didn't stand well my camera, four lens and accessories. It has lost some of the original firmness. As the material got a little bit soft, even open/close the zipper is anoying some times..."
5,Awesome bag,"This bag is wonderful - I can fit 2 D200s each with a lens, 3 flashes, filters, batteries, and anything else I need. IF you are only using one camera I would recommend the 200 instead of the 300."
3,SlingShot300,I love it that you have easy access to your camera and gear from this bag. I did have to do some major reconfiguring to get it to be more useful. The way the bag sits is a tad bit uncomfortable for a woman. I wish these people would get a clue about that sort of thing.My only complaint with this bag...BLACK. It comes in no other colors and has no distinct personality. I am 'doctoring' mine up so it looks at least a little 'girly'.
5,Awesome camera bag!,"Had a different bag before this one. This bag is more efficiently designed and is more functional than any bag that I have owned before. It takes a little getting used to, but after a breaking period of a day, you will love it!!"
5,All-Terrain-Camera-Bag *ATCB!!!!,"What a bag, I had the Slingshot 200...it was outstanding (at the time). When the new SlingShot 300 AW came out though, I had to get it since the 200 I felt like I needed more space at the time. So I traded up to the 300, of which now I plenty of space for my extra lenses. Although I do not have an extra body, I have plenty of accessories that take it's place - flash diffusers, extra lenses...etc."
4,MEET JOSEFINA,"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK IF YOU LIKE TO READ ABOUT GIRLS IN THE PIONEER DAYS. JOSEFINA IS A GIRL WHO LIVES IN NEW MEXICO WITH FOUR SISTERS AND HER PAPA. THEY STRUGGLE EVERY DAY BECAUSE JOSEFINA'S MOTHER DIED RECENTLY. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN INTEREST IN READING ABOUT GIRLS IN THE PIONEER DAYS. I THINK THAT ""AMERICAN GIRL"" BOOKS ARE GREAT BOOKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Flat and rather boring,"This book may be historically accurate, but the characters don't have any voice and they don't seem lifelike or interesting. I noticed the author has no special interest or background in Hispanic culture (she is not even Hispanic!). Why couldn't the publishers have found someone with expertise in New Mexican history to write this book? Instead, they seem to have found a reliable writer who researched the subject well, but had no real spark to bring to the topic."
2,Josefina,The book about Josefina is good but not good enough. It has a lot of facts and info if u are looking for an educational book. The book is for children about the ages of 7-9 or younger. When you are mature or think more about the subjects of books you don't like little books or books about childish things. The book tells you lots of spanish words if u are looking for a language to learn. The book would be a lot better with more suspense and excitement and more details about things.
1,Union Turnpike are the biggest bunch of geeks hahahahah,These nerds are the biggest clowns in queens ..I dont know what possessed RUN to give these 3 nerds a deal..They can't rhyme they are just straight up wack.....Did i metion they are real ugly too one of the members has fake teeth! .hahaha This music disrespects hip hop for realll
4,Memories of Naples,"My only impression of Naples was a sun-filled afternoon many years ago while on a tour of nearby Pompeii and Sorrento. This book conjured those memories for me and made me want to go back and stay longer.A delightful book, far more than a travelogue. Highly recommended!!!!"
3,Hamlet goes to Naples,"Some parts of this book are quite readable: especially when the author isn't talking about himself. The part about Naples underground is interesting. Some of the characters are entertaining. But the description of the author's relationship with his paramour is tedious. Nothing happens. The language is prolix, bordering on philological exhibitionism. I finished Part One. I came to a page announcing Part Two. That was enough."
3,Cool Premise - Lack of Delivery,The book started well and held on but the end disappointed and was abrupt. The idea of missing Vietnam era cavalry troops in Cambodia is cool unto itself. Then the mystical and mysterious enter in and confuse or bore depending on your point-of-view. I am not sure who influenced who but The Reckoning and Scott Smith's The Ruins have some similarities. It was not bad but did not consistently deliver from start to finish.
3,a little disappointed,"First book I have read by Jeff Long.When looking to purchase,I thought the book would be more about the Viet Nam war itself.I could visualize the characters which is importment to me.Overall OK."
2,a disappointment,"This book started with gusto, but fell off very quickly. The ""appearance"" of the ghosts was not a revelation and the fact that some of the travelling party were ghosts, was not a surprise as it was projected long before the reveal. Too much of the storyline was left unexplained....how can one spend so much time with ghosts and not know it? How can one purchase supplies and go for dinner and eat food if one is a ghost? And so on. Yes, I realize this is fiction, but too much of it was left unconnected to make it believable. The ending was not exciting and was left very much unresolved. I never really bought into the whole storyline, since parts were left gaping and unresolved at the end. the descriptions of the ruins were very good and made me think I was there. Character development was good and believeable, but the storyline was just missing too many parts."
3,DEAD RECKONING,"THE RECKONING is one of those books that I wanted to like. Long sets up an interesting premise and evokes a lot of the mood of the Cambodian jungles. His characters are complex and involving, although Kleat's cynicism gets a little out of hand at times. I don't think Long thought his climax out well enough; it's ambiguous as to exactly who these people are and just what happened in this lost city. It seems to end abruptly, without that feeling of closure I need in my novels. Also, Long's pacing is tedious and redundant at times, hindering any suspense he manages to build. There is some tremendous vivid imagery, such as the leaping frogs and the killer monkeys. But it's so esoteric in its climax that I for one felt cheated."
1,"boring, too short, rushed ending","I was a huge fan of the Descent, still one of my favorite books. Year zero was also a great book. This book seemed like it was building up to some climatic finish that never happened. I remember I had kept turning the pages, and as I got closer to the end I started to wonder how he would wrap everything up and have a great finish, it never materialized."
2,"Atmospheric, haunting, BUT....","This offering is not without it's charms: the haunting, creepy prose typical of Jeff Long's other works. However, no serious physical threat to the protagonist ever materializes, and the subtext of the book (the ongoing tragedy of Vietnam soldiers MIA)would have been better served by a more straightforward introduction. As it stands, the author's ""message"" is not put forth until the last few pages when it has been overshadowed by another highly improbable confluence of events. And a character - I am not kidding - getting ""humped by a plant"". Actual quote from the book.It's an okay read, but not one of Jeff Long's better works."
3,Not as good as I see the other reviews would have you believ,"I liked Long's other books (I've read 2 The Descent and Year Zero)enough that I've been anticipating The Reckoning for a while.The only faults in the other books that I found was in the characterizations. This time, it is almost all characterization and the storyline is almost secondary.Mr. Long is a talented writer and I will continue to buy and read what he writes. However, this was not one of my favorites of his work."
2,I RECKON IT'S ABOUT TIME TO MOVE ON!,"I loved Jeff Long's Descent, and liked YEAR ZERO, but this one bored the crap outta me.The story drags...plain and simple.Please, Mr. Long, just make a sequel - and a bloody adventerous one - of Descent.You know that's what everyone wants to see."
2,The Reckoning,"Lack of action (it was described as a thriller?!), poor story line and lackluster characters. Don't waste your time."
5,"""An Essential Audio for Elmer Kelton Fans""","For Kelton fans, this audio like all of his others should not be missed. Unlike most authors, Mr. Kelton is a wonderful speaker. This audio elaborates on his writing style and the way he combines history, myth and folklore in his books. It offers valuable insights into his books and the way he borrows stories he has heard and people he has met for use in his outstanding novels like The Time It Never Rained, The Day the Cowboys Quit, etc. Plus a listener realizes what a fine, generous, and modest individual Mr. Kelton actually is which will further enrich each rereading of his books. I can't recommend this audio too highly. Any aspiring writer or fan of Western American literature will love listening to it as I do."
3,Its mediocore,"I think the album as a whole is kind of bland. I feel like only musicians would enjoy this album , which is a big con. Theres really not much melodic value. I would recommend Kurt Rosenwinkel, instead of Monder. Ive seen some Monder videos on Youtube, which are great performances, but this album is just blahhh (bad discriptor). I think Kurt put a bit more time into his albums and focus on being more melodical than technical. Monder is a great player, and a great soloist, but song writer? no thanks. Not my cup of tea i guess."
2,Boring? You bet your sweet Ash.,"Ya' know, making a big deal about how beautiful digital cinematography is and/or special effects in this day and age seems the acme of silliness. A new Mac G5 in your basement is all it takes. What you need is a good story, and that is based on a minimum of two things: premise and charater development. This movie does have a neat premise....and that's where it ends. There is no character development to speak of, and the movie suffers for it. So even if you don't give a hoot about the characters, you at least want to see the execution of the premise. That execution unfurls at a snail's pace, and without any real tension (I mean it is virtual reality right?). The end result is the type of uninspired, plodding 'anime' drivel that you fall asleep to at 3 a.m. watching the Cartoon Network."
1,Overhyped,"Slow, unoriginal, meaningless. Don't believe James Cameron's endorsement on the cover. The visuals - I expected much more. The action scenes are uninspired. It feels like a plodding anime - guess why. And the ending - feh."
2,very weak sci fi game movie,"I LOVE Sci Fi books and movies, but this one just wasn't worth watching. The story is very weak, there is a lot of repetition, and the effects were just so-so. Definitely not worth more than a few bucks.... unfortunate."
5,A must-see for anyone,"Avalon, directed by Mamoru Oshii, who also directed Ghost in the Shell . . . Really beautifully done and thought provoking . . . Combined with special effects worthy of The Matrix, and boasting a great storyline that The Matrix never truly delivered. The choice of colors reminds me of both Schindler's List and .Hack//SIGN. The music score is both haunting and beautiful .If there is an antithesis to the Hollywood film industry, an antithesis that is everything a Hollywood film is often not, then this is it . . .The new dub is quite good, though perhaps missing some of the subtleties of the original."
4,A superlative odyssey,"Perhaps one of the most gorgeously filmed movies I've seen (but I'm partial to the anything with a golden glow).The ending seems rather abrupt to me - almost too easy... I would have prefered a better lead-in to the final stage and a more symbolic/psychological ""chase"" sequence, but hey, it's a movie and has it's constraints which I can appreciate.Good movie and I'm proud to own it."
5,Very cute for a toddler,"We love this pretend CD player for our little Ariel fan (daughter). It is cute, fun & durable. She loves dancing to the ""tunes"". This IS a pretend cd player by the way......don't get it if you want a real cd player....why anyone one would get a real cd player for a toddler I have no idea????"
5,Love this mouse! My 2nd one too.,My first mouse got stepped on and ruined and I loved that mouse so much that I searched for this one online and found it and bought for a great price. Love this little easily maneuverable mouse. It fits well in smaller hands.
1,Can't install & support is AWFUL,"Plug-and-play doesn't seem to work, and this is only brand I've ever had that problem with. I called Support (after 20 minutes searching their web site trying to solve the problem). I got transferred around and they collected my email address and phone number twice (and wrong, apparently). And at 10-minute mark, I had yet to talk to anyone about fixing what could be a simple mouse problem.Given the tremendous overhead in getting support for such a simple piece of hardware, and given that it didn't work for even it's most basic functions, I can't recommend anyone spending their money on this."
1,I was scammed,"I paid $9.99 for a 74 page paperback originally published in 1930. Kelly has a few good points but most of the book is outdated.Amazon please remove William J O'neil from the author area for this book. O'neil referenced Kelly's ""The turkey story"" in one of his books...that's it. NOTE: William J Oneil started ""investors business daily""."
3,amusing,"an amusing book containing many ""truths"" but I didn't find it particularly informative. I guess I was looking for more specific information rather than gerealities."
4,Really pretty........but kinda wierd,"I love this bra....it's so pretty, the lace is gorgeous, especially in Black, and it fits like a glove, which Is rare! BUT, the only thing I have a problem with is the underwire...it protrudes just slightly too much and looks kinda wierd on. It's fine with a low tank top, but doesn't really look right under a sweater. All in all it's a nice bra, and really beautiful, only complaint is the underwire!"
2,"Supportive, but scratchy bra","I found this bra to be pretty compared to other minimizers out there. I liked the support and shape that it gave, but the bra is so scratchy and uncomfortable that I only wear it when all my other bras are dirty! I would rather pay more for the Wacoal minimizers to have all day comfort and support."
4,Highly refined indie rock,"Quirky but not obnoxious, melodic and hardly pretentious indie rock is a solid outing of ambitious Incubus-like excursions into soothingly upbeat, passively-aggressive effective pop-rock deviations which keeps the music accessible but challenging at the same time."
4,Accessible but doubtful,"This book was admittedly expensive for its small size. However, the author provides a good introduction to the Synoptic Problem, allowing a person who is not familiar with the related scholarship to have a good grasp of the topic.However, the content and arguments are biased towards one particular theory. As a student of philosophy, I personally find some of the reasoning of the author in favor of his position to be highly suspectible and weak.Nevertheless, I benefited from reading this book, though I am sure there are better and more strongly argued scholarship on this topic"
4,Great everyday watch.,"This is a great watch for everyday use. The band is a little more narrow then I expected, but the simple face is great. The leather band is getting a little warped near the clasp, but as long as you use the same setting every time, it isn't noticeable. I love it, and it was a great gift from a great girlfriend."
4,Thought We Could,Tracks: 1) Faith 2) Make me 3) The Gypsy Problem 4) Working Man's Prayer 5) The Coldest House In Texas 6) Tape Lender Alarm Clock 7) Horizontal Boom-Boom 8) Crisis 9) Gutentag 10) High Five Economics 11) This Golden This
3,Ok instrumental soul R&B,"Oliver Sain used to play at our elementary school dances in the 1960s. I couldn't wait to get this CD to relive old memories. Though the music sounds good, it is nearly all instrumental and gets a little boring at times. The mix is bad. High frequencies are way too loud. It hurts my ears to listen to. I'd need a graphic equalizer to balance the sound."
5,CB&J,"That's ""cashew butter & jelly"". I've had a peanut allergy for 65 years. When cashew butter arrived on the market years ago i tried it and loved it. This brand is excellent, pure cashews."
4,GOOD FOR ALL NATURAL,"I was looking for an alternative to peanut butter, which i have gotten bored with. Im on a high protien diet, trying to loose weight. The previouse reviews were ok so i figured i'd give it a chance. It taste good, i felt like it needed salt. Im not a ALL NATURAL type girl. However it did taste ok without salt. i added 2 teaspoons of salt to the jar and it was deliciouse. i keep the jar on my desk and im loving it."
1,"So, so, sooooo disappointing.","Simply don't bother with this hat. The quality is atrocious - you could buy a better coolie hat used at a thrift store or garage sale for less than a dollar (in fact, I have). Even the strap is of horrendous quality. I'd return it, but it simply isn't worth the time or postage. Stay away, and save your money."
3,complicated,"Lamentably buy it without knowing that permission totally unarmed, for which it is not what was waiting, I cannot qualify his functioning because still I do not obtain the one who me assembles it."
3,Persian Flag,"The material was not very good, however, I plan to use it inside and it will be fine for now."
2,I don't like the quality,"The quality is not that good, I really was waiting for a better one, it feels all plastic, it costs 5 sth dollars and the shipping from US to Malaysia costs more than 6dollars, which I thought the seller wrote the shipping is free, or sth like that, anyways , the big problem is the bad quality."
5,Love the 1 & 2 mile on the same disc!,"I love this workout and all Leslie Sansone workouts. It is simple, but is a great workout. She is encouraging without being annoying. I think the change in movement really works the whole body and keeps my muscles from getting ""bored."" I like this specific video because it is just Leslie in the studio and not anyone else working out with her. I can really concentrate on the movements and working hard."
4,Great for travelers,I am travelling every week and this is perfect to do in my hotel room. Great workout for beginners. X
4,I like it.,"I am a 65 yr old woman who used to be quite active. This tape allows me to get some exercise in the house without any other props. It's very easy to follow, and gets your heart rate up. I always feel better about myself after I complete this 1 mile walk."
5,Love Leslie!,"Ok, sometimes I find her a little bit annoying... but overall I like her workouts and I love that they are reasonable and accessible for people of varying fitness levels. I would always recommend Leslie Sansone workouts."
5,"Good service, good products.",Great beginners and intermediates workout for in home exercising. I had had Sansone's VHS tapes but wanted to update to DVDs.
5,EXERCISE FOR ALL!,"I have found Leslie Sansone's videos make a difference in my life! It can be at beginner level, intermediate, or super body builder level, they have done exactly that....made a difference in my life!"
5,Exceptional 10*'s,"This is by far the Best workout I have ever seen put together. The 2 mile is butt-kicking and really puts us through the wringer; but in a good way. My husband does it every night after work, and we both feel this is a perfect amount of time and energy after a long day at work. It is low enough impact that our knees, and other joints aren't being abused by jumping around or hopping etc; but tough enough to build strength and muscle on our couch potato, over 50 'back-ends' as Leslie says, lol. -- Don't let the 1 mile one fool you either, boy howdy! She starts all nice and sweet and you get to thinking she's going to cut you a bit of slack because it's only 1 mile... but HA!!! you're going to sweat and that's just the way it is! -- I can't say enough how great this DVD is, both the 1 AND 2 mile; so I'll just quit now so you can go order it!"
4,I like the countdown.,I like to do a short workout before I go to work. I like the feature that shows you how much time is left on the video.
4,power walk,This is a great way to get started on an exercise program. I love getting my walk done in my home. I hate walking in the wind or rain and cold so this is a great way to get the best walk.
4,Start Walking with Leslie Sansone 1 & 2 Mile Walk,good DVD. I am a beginner so this is just right for me. Easy to get started slowly. May order other DVD's by Sansone
4,Good for a Quick Home Workout,"I've been having some knee problems that make elliptical workouts painful, so I was looking for something that would allow me to do some cardio without causing pain. This was it! The video has 2 workouts, a 20 min 1 mile and a 30 min 2 mile. The music ain't great, but it gets the heart rate up, and the beat becomes oddly addictive after awhile. Solid workout."
2,I HAD ONE...,I HAD ONE AND WHEN WE TRANSFERRED TO A NEW HOME... WITH BUBBLE WRAP THIS ITEM SUDDENLY SNAPPED IN TWO WHILE IN TRANSPORT. NOT RELIABLE!!!
3,An antisocial witch,"After reading this interesting memoir regarding Ayn Rand, I am confirmed in my opinion that she simply didn't measure up to the standards of human decency. Why Branden continues to have any respect for her is beyond me."
1,Bad Fiction,"There is no ""mystery"" to Rand's life. She has written volumes about all her ideas and her character. Branden has very little intellectual capacity left and does not even embrace Objectivism, but tries to undermine reason, virtue and value in the name of ""Objectivism"".This book is one of the worst works of fiction I have ever read. If you want to know about Rand's life read Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead, or for non-fiction; Capitalism The Unknown Ideal, The Romantic Manifesto, The Virtue of Selfishness or Objectivism:The Philosophy of Ayn Rand. For more reading pick up any of her articles written for the New York Times.It is frightening that a person that has been removed from Rand's life because she discovered him to be without virtue and a liar can then claim to ""know"" her better than anyone and that others would want to read his book and take it as Truth."
1,Thoroughly Refuted,Recent scholarship has demonstrated the complete dishonesty of this work (and its earlier version) and its historical unreliability.
1,What's Left To Lie About?,"Branden lied to Ayn Rand about so much for so long, lied to his readers about his ""break"" with Rand in 1968, and still continues in his lies about his former lies. Branden's first set of lies, Judgment Day, has been revised to account for new set of lies."
1,Smear and exploitation of Ayn Rand (read The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics for the whole story),"This book is a smear job against Ayn Rand so that Nathaniel Branden can clean up his own tarnished reputation while cashing in on Ayn Rand's fame.James S. Valliant, in his book The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics: The Case Against the Brandens, thoroughly dissects the claims made by the Brandens against Ayn Rand. He then references Ayn Rand's own personal journals to systematically demonstrate how Barbara and Nathaniel Branden deceived and exploited Ayn Rand for years for their own illegitimate aims. Even after Ayn Rand's death, the Brandens continue to cash in on Ayn Rand's self-made fame and her original philosophy of Objectivism."
3,Life with a sacred monster,"Nathaniel Branden, one helluva brave and tenacious man, conducts us through the years of his relationship with the brilliant and impossibly difficult Ayn Rand, through the inception and growth of the Objectivist movement and the interactions of its central leadership, ""the Collective."" It's utterly fascinating to watch these giants of mind, ego, and wrongheadedness having at one another, rather like war among the dinosaurs. Branden spares no one in his recollections, himself least of all. This is both a period piece and a psychological exposition, and once fairly into it you can't put the daggone thing down."
3,This movie inspires a Love/Hate relationship with it...,"It's ""interesting"" but ""confusing."" I think it's the continuity problems with so darn many people dying and then getting resurrected, sometimes in new bodies... It's just, well, confusing. Don't get me wrong it's kind of a cool movie once you've watched it a couple times and understand what the heck is going on.It has some really cool special effects, but it also has some really cheesy special effects. So, I suppose I could best describe it as having ""inconsistent"" special effects.On the plus side, this feature has both the American-released chop-job and the ""extended"" (Read: original) Cantonese version. So, in that regard, it is good. So, if you really want to watch the unedited version in subtitles, you can. Probably one of the saving graces of this release.Video's okay, audio's okay, voice acting is so-so for the dub... It's kind of a bizarro live-action anime in some regards. Oddly reminiscent of Dragon Ball Z."
2,Impressive Special Effects but no convincing story,"Like the title says, the special effects, although sometimes a bit too colorful for my taste, were very impressive. But they are the only thing this movie got going for itself. The story was one of the most confusing I ever witnessed. Perhaps some of it would make some sense to a connaisseur of Chinese legends but I was completely lost. Fans of Martial Arts movies will be equally disappointed by the lack thereof. There is only a single and short fight which involves martial arts (between Hollow, Joy and Thunder). All the other fights are resolved by overpowering the enemy with ones magic and are mostly overshadowed by special effects. My guess is that Tsui Hark got a bit carried away by his special effects and in the process neglected the other components of the movie, mainly the story."
3,"Some creative ideas, but okay script and special effects are hit and miss.","Keep your expectations low and this movie will pass as entertaining. There's a nice story in the movie, but the script doesn't do it justice. I played the Enlgish language version, so I don't know if the Chinese version was better. The special effects were great at times, but were terrible for the most part. The actors were great and did the best they could. Some interesting fighting scenes. The immortal beings storyline reminds me of the Japanese anime Scrapped Princess, which I do recommend. Watch it for some of the creative visual effects, but don't buy it."
4,Great Film!,"This movie will be appreciated by Martial Arts Lovers...Not the ones with Guns in them...This is a Wuxia Pien, Film and Expect the CGI and Animation but it is the Dragon Ball Z Brought to LIFE without the fake looking stuff like the cheap budgeted Martial Arts Films..This has lots of Fantasy but filled with Fighting ...It's Great...If you love Jet Li Films of the flying action fighters..then this is your type...GET IT!"
3,Eh,"I rented this movie and while watching it I remembered I had already seen this years ago. Maybe back then the CGI effects were amazing, but no one would think the same thing today. The story moves along at a fast pace and there are some moments of emotion. Overall, fun to watch and laugh at the wierd story and CGI effects. Worth a rent only."
3,"Weird, Enjoyable, but Ultimately Forgetable.","As a kung fu fantasy, this film has a lot going for it. It's sensibility is very Asian mythic with heroes that fly through the air and send their sword zipping along with telekinetic powers. I enjoyed it at first, but the pacing is so hectic and the direction so frantic that it began to wear on me a bit. I would've enjoyed some more geniune martial arts acrobatics instead of the Wu Shu wirework. But that isn't the intent of the film, and so this criticism can be largely dismissed.However, despite many cool ideas, including a demon who appears to be made only of red cloth, a ancient master who uses his long eyebrows as weapons, and a woman who has the power to freeze people solid, the film never quite meshed together into a solid whole for me. It didn't really leave much of an impression. Worth seeing if you want to watch some weird Asian cinema. Otherwise, just okay."
1,Couldn't wait for this movie to end,"Featuring an all star cast, this movie should really have been a lot better. However, even these stars could not defeat the horrible script. A nonsensical plot with gimmicky supernatural effects left this feeling more like a children's cartoon than an action movie. Save yourself some time and skip this one.You won't understand the plot -- because there is none. You won't be impressed by the special effects -- unless you want to see people fly through the air (think Superman, not Crouching Tiger) with a blue streak trailing them. The fight scenes are far and few between -- and the fighters often rely more on supernatural weapons than acrobatic kung fu. I gave this movie 1 star, because that's the lowest score available. It really didn't deserve a star at all."
1,"hollow and meaningless graphic junk, deserve NO STAR!!","this is a ridiculous and clueless graphical junk! terrible! after watching it going mindlessly nowhere for 20 minutes, all of us, parents and teenagers, cursed loudly and decided to reject the dvd. WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK! we are very angry at the screenplay writer, director, the production and the release companies. acting? absolutely non-exist. pure computer generated junk so crappy that almost made us puke!"
3,Unique/Fun,"Like 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' with computer generated weapons. It took a while for this one to grow on me. The pacing of this movie is fast moving. Miramax's recent release features both the uncut version (Cantonese 104 min) and the cut version (English dubbed 80 min). The posatives to the movie are: it's fun to watch, the actors are easy to like, and the action music is ok. The downside: the special effects are a bit outdated (and there's alot of it), I also would like to have seen more of the fantasy scenery, and Zhang Ziyi's role is somewhat limited despite the way it is marketed. Ekin Cheng, Louis Koo, and Cecilia Cheung are the main characters. Overall, this is more of a fun movie but not any spectacular masterpiece. I liked it, but not everyone will. The most interesting thing is just how different the script is of the English dubbed version from the subtitled Cantonese version!"
2,Poor Quality,"This should cost $15, I can't believe how cheaply and poorly made it is for the cost. When it arrived it already had a cracked glass and the handle was falling off the basket, which is attached with hot glue and what seems like round paper fasteners. The straps are cheap plastic, everything about it is poorly made of the cheapest materials. Cups and plates are plastic, silverware is thin steel. The only reason I didn't return it is because I needed to use it so I superglued the bottom of the cup together and just went with it. I would not recommend this product, it would be better if you got a cheap basket and brought your own utensils. I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money."
3,Stark raving naked in a fornication nation,"This album features Mojo Nixon's usually brand of goofy rockabilly. His sense of humor is pretty juvenile, as evidenced by ""Debbie Gibson is Pregnant With My Two Headed Love Child"". Still, the album is sporadically amusing. But ""(619)239-KING"" is too obvious an attempt to duplicate the success of his most famous song, ""Elvis is Everywhere"". Two of the songs here, ""Tennesse Jive"" and ""Circus Mystery"", are by Mojo's former partner, Skid Roper. I wonder whatever happened to that guy? Anyway, Mojo's fans should enjoy this album."
3,Stark raving naked in a fornication nation.,"This album features Mojo Nixon's usually brand of goofy rockabilly. His sense of humor is pretty juvenile, as evidenced by ""Debbie Gibson is Pregnant With My Two Headed Love Child"". Still, the album is sporadically amusing. But ""(619)239-KING"" is too obvious an attempt to duplicate the success of his most famous song, ""Elvis is Everywhere"". Two of the songs here, ""Tennesse Jive"" and ""Circus Mystery"", are by Mojo's former partner, Skid Roper. I wonder whatever happened to that guy? Anyway, Mojo's fans should enjoy this album."
3,Imaginative Illustrations.,"CHIMPS DON'T WEAR GLASSES is a book written towards children illustrating how powerful one's imagination can be. Through a series of illustrations and text that covers the pictures, the book presents a world that would indeed be very wacky if chimps wore glasses. In such a world kangaroos read books, horses hang glide, mice are in the Boy Scouts, pandas pole vault, and many creatures obey a chipmunk who is king. The message of the book is very detailed and as written in the book is actually a bit confusing. Nevertheless, children will love looking at the book and all the crazy illustrations. Just don't ever get stuck by a giraffe on the interstate."
3,Okay,It is a book and it is as expected a little beat up but totally fine. No complaints from me and my son enjoys it !
2,This CD is....,This CD is an okay CD. It's not the best and i've heard better. Analia's voice does not seem to have any power like Celine Dion or Whitney Houston. Some of the music in the songs don't sound as good also because they don't use real instruments and sounds kind of wierd.(don't ask me how i know because i saw your site)
2,Review of Time of the Dragon Box set.,"This Box Set attempts to expand on the Dragonlance world by introducing another continent to the world of Krynn. Compared to David ""Zeb"" Cook's game mastery in the AD&D 2nd Edition guide book and the Forgotten Relms setting, this supplement falls far from the mark. Related to the well known continent of Anaslon primarily in sharing the same pantheon, this should be considered a whole new world that was linked to the main Dragonlance area by a trecherous ocean years before the current storyline. If this were a product that was designed to create a whole new world, it would get 3 stars for the quality and throughness...but it suffers mightily by the atemped link to the rest of the world that's hardly related to by the rest of the source material."
5,Brooks Challenge tool bag,"Brooks Challenge Bicycle Tool/Saddle BagI bought the tool bag to match my Brooks B-17 Special saddle. The combo looks smashing on my commuter bike. Only problem is that it doesn't hold much. I couldn't get a spare tube in with the tools and patch kit. Maybe the Brits don't get flats; who knows? Still, its beautiful and the leather is first quality."
2,Zero functionality and smashing looks..,"As the previous reviewer mentioned, it looks really really cool.. The catch is, it doesnt hold anything at all.. I need a spare tube, a Topeak tool kit which is fairly tiny, a compact pump, patch kit, a pair of tire lever.. Absolute minimum in case of a flat. I cannot do without any of them. Now, i can only fit at the max three at a time. The rest should go in my carry bag..If you are my kind of a guy, look for something else.. If you prefer looks over functionality this is the tool bag without a doubt.."
3,Where's James Brown?,"This soundtrack is fine, but its missing a funky song by James Brown called ""Super Bad."" This song is the music that they play in the movie during the scene where Billy Hoyle and Sidney Dean play in the championship of the brotherhood tounament. Its a great song, but its not on the CD. Besides that, you should be pleased with the purchase if you were a fan of the movie."
5,"an extremely clear, helpful tool","This is an extremely cogent tool for anyone engaged with a spiritual path--not just Zen. The Oxherding Pictures are a Zen tool for understanding your own level of understanding on the path, and I think this book is really clear and compelling. Even if you are a practitioner from a different lineage or tradition altogether, you will find this a wise, humbling book that you will consult over and over again."
3,Larger than it looks,"I saw this product at a store years ago and I've wanted it since then. The store stopped stocking it, so I was glad to finally be able to get it at Amazon for a reasonable price. I am not sure that this is the same bowl that I saw in the store, though. This is a bit flimsier than I expected (or than my memory says). It is also larger than you would expect from the photo. It holds many more sugar cubes than it appears to, and is larger in comparison to them. In a way that is good, but for my kitchen I was hoping for something smaller."
4,The Man Behind the Hits,"I do agree with the reader from Kansas City to a certian extent. The interwoven commentary weakens Tony's message. But this book is great for the beginner and veteran of baseball alike. He explains his position on everything from the paint job on his bat [the ""Gwynn Finish""] to Scott Radinsky. A fun book to read."
2,Very little meat,"Very little meat in this book. I can sum up all the hitting instruction with keep your hands relaxed, have a small stride, step softly towards the pitch, and stay inside the ball. I liked Ted Williams book much better."
4,"Love Gwynn, but Merely Like This Book","I have all the respect in the world for Tony Gwynn, and don't regret purchasing this book for one minute. But, if you're looking for anything that could compare to ""The Mike Schmidt Study,"" or Ted Williams' ""The Science of Hitting,"" or even Charlie Lau's ""The Art of Hitting .300,"" I'm afraid this book is not the answer.It's basically a short biography/autobiography, with a few pages on hitting technique, and multiple portions on philosophy. Buy it because you're a Gwynn fan, or because you're a completist, and want a library of every book that discusses hitting, or everything by Hall-of-Famers, or whatever. But if you're really looking for hitting instruction, and you're only going to buy a handful of hitting books, this one, unfortunately, shouldn't make the cut."
3,Works but way overpriced,"I bought this every month for a year as it is the only one the manufacturer of our floors recommends. Also, I did try a few other products that did not work as well. That is until I switched to Bona. I find it is just as good for one-third the price. Unless the price drastically drops,I will not be ordering this again."
1,0 stars! Scam!,"Smells like windex ( Window cleaning solution) better off with vinegar and hot water to clean your laminate flooring its just as good or even better, organic and inexpensive.Reminds me to compare ingredients with windex I swear the smell identical."
4,Good Book,I only give this book 4 stars because there were a few errors. It was a good book however and i passed the exam using it. Use this book as an exam guide but not a reference guide. the author even points that out in the beginning of the book. I even found eratta info on his web site. Good bang for the buck
1,Light Weight,"I took the exam just once and passsed it. I am A+, CNA, MCP and pursuing MCSE. I don't believe that I could have passed the Win95 exam by just reading only this book despite all the raving reviews here. Yes, the authors writes in an easy-to-follow style. But the content lacked in depth coverage on details and esoterica that Microsoft loves to hitting on. The end of the chapter questions in the book were too easy and almost caught me thinking that this test was going to be painless. NO WAY! You will be shocked by the multi- scrolling-screened scenario questions in the real test. I had to get another study guide and practice tests to really prep for the exam."
5,"This is my 2nd review, I've now passed70-64 exam w/ a 918","Marcus did a great job writing this book and is quick to mark corrections on his website. I first reviewed the book with 5 stars while only on chapter 3, but after finishing the last chapter I took the exam and passed on the first try with a 918. The Test Day Fast facts at the beginning of each chapter proved to be highly beneficial."
4,"Excellent guide for the beginner, incomplete by itself.","I passed my exam first try due in part to this book. It was an excellent introduction, however I would not have been as successful on the exam if this was my sole study guide. I followed this study guide with the Win 95 part of MCSE complete by Newriders. All and all, I would recommend this book to a friend."
4,"Good, one stop, book for passing the Win95 MCP exam","This book can be used to pass the Windows 95 MCP exam (70-63), with no other books. Having said that, there are a some mistakes, and an additional book would help to spot and correct these. I used the Windows 95 Resource Kit, which is an excellent reference book anyway. My only real criticism are the practice questions. They are far too simplistic. The exams in the test are much more scenario based, and are a bit of a suprise if you have only read this book. In spite of this, I passed the exam first time."
4,Easy to read and understand but beware.......,"I like this book and I emailed the publisher to say so although I haven't heard anything back yet. Perhaps this was because I also had a little pop at the obvious lack of quality proof-reading that was involved! There are just too many silly little mistakes and minor, but important, technical inaccuracies that could so easily lead a person astray.For a good, easy read this is worth consideration but only if you are up on the subject enough already to notice the errors!Enjoy."
4,Great book...really helped me pass,"After reading several other so called exam prep books and then failing the exam , I decided to pick this one up after reading all the great reviews. The second time I wrote the exam I passed with flying colors. I got 20% more then I needed to pass. Thanks Mr. Barton on a job well done."
1,Not at all expensive and worth every penny!,"I used this book as my primary and almost exclusive study guide for the exam. Having used Windows '95 extensively for some time and more than a little comfortable with installing, configuring, and optimizing both the host computer as well as peripheral hardware, I was pleased when I found more than half of the book dealing with just these subjects. But when I went to take the exam, I found it was another story. The exam dealt predominantly with networking and the book didn't. I knew the book but found it to be quite different than the actual exam! My advice is to search elsewhere!"
4,"Sweet book, I passed the exam after finishing the book.","Overall, the book was good. There were sometimes that I thought the book could have been organized a little better. Some of the pictures didn't seem to match the text. I learned that this wasn't the fault of the author. The quick facts in the beginning of the chapters were helpful, especially before the exam. I also had the help of the ""Self Test Software"" practice exams. I've only been working with computers for about a year. Before that it was all Finance. This book brought me up to speed very quickly. The author was also quick to email back answers to my questions."
4,"Good summary or review reading, but not to learn from.","This book would serve as a cheaper (versus the $100 hardbacks) review tool. Most subjects dont' go in-depth enough for all of the test material. Review questions in the book should have been harder, also. Overall, though, not bad for the bucks."
5,"Excellent, rugged and accurate.","I bought this watch about a year ago.I have been wearing it diving, firing at the range, in zero to 115 degree temperatures, and while doing construction work. The watch is accurate and very easy to see at night (with the tritium vials). With all the activities and beating I give this watch, it doesn't have any scratches on the crystal.I changed the rubber strap watch band to a NATO nylon strap.This watch replaced a TRASER dive watch I got in 1989. That watch still runs great but the tritium has dimmed over the last 22 years.The Black Storm is a great watch."
5,I keep reading it and reading and reading,"I don't see how anyone can NOT like this book. Oooh super [intercourse], a fine...detective, a strong independent woman, fighting their feelings for one another.This book is great and buy it."
2,Unprofessional police officer,"Detective Sean Richter had to be the most unprofessional police officer in history. The scene between him and Claire in Olivia's kitchen was disgusting. I also found it hard to believe they fell in love in just a month. All in all, the book really wasn't too bad, just not the best."
1,In a Word:Tedious,"Maybe the expectations were too high. Readers of her mom: warning: this book is tedious. The book is too long (tedious) ; the characters uninteresting, leaving the reader uncaring; and the dialogue is tedious. Chapter headings give locales, but too many times these are unnecessary. The plot is flat, maybe because the characters are. The love scenes are boring (tedious). There are no surprises or unexpected happenings. A really good editor could have pealed this huge volume down to reveal a semi-interesting novel, not more than a Silhouette in length. Hope springs eternal, so maybe her second (if there is one) will be better."
1,Unreadable,"I almost never stop reading a book a quarter of the way through but I bought this book because I thought it was a crime/suspense novel and it turned out to be a lousy romance with a tacked on twisted murderer. The overarching story was the romance between the detective who falls in love with the gorgeous, unconscious victim (boundaries much?) and the gutsy gal with the ""dancing black eyes"" (what does that even mean?) Gaak. Sadly for me, I bought both this author's novels at the same time. I'm glad to see she gave up writing."
5,super romantic suspense,"With her first book, ""When The Storm Breaks"", Heather Lowell has written a stunning story of murder and obsession. Claire Lambert, on her way home from an appointment at a dating service happens upon a murder being committed. While fleeing from the savage attack Claire herself is injured when she slips down any icy staircase. While in the hospital Claire learns that she is the only witness to a possible serial slaying, but her injury though not severe causes traumatic amnesia. None the less, she finds herself embroiled in a murder investigation and the target of a relentless killer. Sean Richter, the detective assigned to the case must find the killer before he gets to Claire. His attraction to his only witness may prevent Sean from being as professional as he'd like but he'll risk anything to protect this woman.This is one hot summer read."
4,Good read.,"I liked the characters and thought the dialogue was funny. This is a very good first novel, and I was here in Amazon looking for another book by Heather Lowell to read. In When the Storm Breaks, we watch two control freaks struggle with losing control; Clare whose carefully organized world gets tipped on end and Sean whose caredully controlled emotions and rules of conduct go out the window when he meets Clare. I like the struggle between instinctive attraction and professional or self imposed rules of conduct. The internal dialogue was funny. It was refreshing that both protagonists had equally developed tempers and vulnerablilites and that the tempers didn't turn violent. I liked the byplay between Aiden and Sean and Olivia and Clare too. I also thought the sex scenes were pretty darn hot."
4,the classic Concrete Blonde CD,"This is the classic collection of Concrete Blonde songs. And with ""Roses Grow,"" in my opinion their best song, you've got a CD you'll want to keep coming back to."
4,L.A. rock at its best.,"Concrete Blonde's second offering has a tough streetwise edge to it from the in-your-face lyrics of ""God is a Bullet"", to the jaded ""Scene of a Perfect Crime"", to the stark reality of ""Happy Birthday.""Another great album by the Blonde."
4,"As ""must have"" as their others.","Why is it always the coolest records that go out of print? Well, if you're familiar with ""Concrete Blonde"", then you already know you should get this if you don't have it. Being the second album, I find it most like the debut, a little bit punk, a little bit goth, but all around excellent whatever you call it. One thing I love about them, like ""Jane's Addiction"", is the ability to totally rock on one song, and then create the most beautiful soft ballad afterwards. The musicianship of the band is matched only by Johnette's incredible voice. If looking for your first CB disc, I would go for ""Recollection"". That will get you three of these tracks, plus 15 others. ""Free"" is only about 33 minutes long too. Whatever you do, listen to ""Concrete Blonde""."
5,Johnette Rocks!,"I agree with all of the above reviews that this is Concrete Blonde's best album, but I have to add that 'Little Conversations' is another of the stand-out tracks and blows my mind every time I listen to it (one for those quiet moments)."
4,Great rock and roll record,"1989's ""Free"", is a great rock and roll record. Johnette Napolitano and company give us the classic rocker ""God is a Bullet"", Thin Lizzy's great remake of ""It's Only Money"", ""Help Me"", ""Carry Me Away"" and ""Scene Of A Perfect Crime""(love that song). The only weakness is it only has 33 minutes on the cd."
3,Good - But not what I expected.,"Lots of historical information about some of the major tourist sights in Paris, with some really beautiful photography. A good virtual tour. But, not how to tour Paris. The title says ""Touring Paris Made E-Z"", so I thought it would have information about the metro, how to get from point A to point B; maybe info about currency exchange, how to rent a car, etc.If you want a virtual tour, fine, buy it. Unfortunately, the sights covered are mainly close to the city center. It would be nice if it covered Versailles, something I'm really looking forward to seeing when I go to Paris in a few months."
2,Disappointing,"As a mother, I was excited when I read the review stating this book was one every mother should have. I imagined a touching, sentimental book. I was disappointed. The ""poems"" seem like random thoughts and ramblings. None of them made me feel touched as a mother. It seemed to only be about the gross and annoying aspects of childhood. I imagine the author was attempting humor, but I didn't find it very funny. If you know what to expect, the book is for you. But if you are expecting a soft, warm, cozy feeling--skip this."
1,Very poor quality,"There's not alot to say. The heads twist off these screwswhen you ""attempt"" to tighten them. They are NOT a true #2 size.I tried to use these where I usualy use a #2 screw from FENDER for mounting vintage guitar tuners. In 25 years of building guitars(20 at fender) I have NEVER twisted a tuner screw's head off. They always strip the philips first, & there about .025"" thicker than these screws. Don't waste youe money, these are awfull."
2,Poor Excuse for Journalism,"I have read some of Vidal's biographies, and was interested in his analysis of the current political situation. I feel that we do indeed get a slanted version of the 'truth', and hope that by looking at many viewpoints with a critical eye, some semblance of the truth will eventually stand out. This book was less than helpful. I fail to see the value of the purely low-class cheap shots (e.g. on Barbara Bush's looks), the unsupported assertions (e.g. most of the 'incursions' vaguely listed 'we started') or the vapid sources quoted as 'research' (e.g. the Federation of American Scientists, neither a federation nor comprised of real scientists) in developing an understanding of the US position in the world. I have concluded that Mr. Vidal's writings were not rejected because they were unpopular. They were rejected because they were lousy."
3,A Bit extreme,"To start off with, Gore Vidal is one angry man. This book is basically saying that it really isn't McVeigh's fault for the Oklahoma bombing but the governments for their involvement in Waco and other instances. He gives McVeigh's point of view on the entire events from Waco to his execution and then shows where the Government went wrong and could have prevented the whole thing. He does take it a bit far with the government bashing though (not that I'm saying our governemtn doesn't deserve a little bashing here and there!)The plus side to this book is it DOES give the other side of the story in Oklahoma which is a quality lacking in todays one sided, corporate media."
1,full of sound and fury,"Despite its engaging and incisive title, the book is a a hodge-podge of mostly outdated and disconnected polemics touching on subjects as varied as the Clinton Health Plan, teenage sex, farm politics, and the Oklahoma City Bombing. The author does make some excellent points but his material comes with such a froth of hyperbole that even otherwise legitimate criticism seems nonsensical."
1,Truman Capote writes political essays?,"on recalling when he realized the bill of rights had expired--For me it was sometime in 1960 at a Party in Beverly Hills that I got the bad news from the constitutionally cheery actor Cary Grant. He hade just flown in from New York. He had, he said, picked up his ticket at an airline counter in a magical old-world airport....""there were these lovely girls behind the counter, and they were delighted to help me, or so they said. I signed some autographs. Then I asked one for my tickets. Suddenly she was very solemn. ""Do you have identification?""This is mostly glossy magazine writing. Don't hope for any compelling analysis of warfare."
4,An important voice,"We of a certain political bent welcome the viewpoints of learned observers such as Gore Vidal and Noam Chomsky among precious few others. This short book puts a magnifying glass on the recent events post-9/11 as well as the McVeigh drama. Vidal has some pet topics, which find their way into this work, but for the most part the book is a sober coherent look at the role of the U.S. in the world today and the very shaky hands that are at the wheel."
3,"Comes up short, and topic misleads","Vidal's title was so enticing, so promising: who better than Vidal to disect the pathetic myths of the ""war on terrorism?"" But Vidal digresses, and talks a good deal more about Tim McVeigh. It ends up being a short, and somewhat weak effort by Vidal, who was capable of something far greater. Parenti and Chomsky have done a better job of skewering American jingoism before and after 9/11."
2,Not Very Well Organized!!!,"I am very disappointed with the book. I saw Gore Vidal on [the] News and bought the book because I became interested in some of his points of view and yearned for a more in depth analysis. The book did explain his theories but this could have been done in 10 pages. The rest of the 150 pages of his book were repetitive, disorganized and contained information that was neither here nor there. The book is not a complete flop but it is hardly what I expeted! Think twice before purchasing!!!P.S. Approx 40 pages of the 150 were dedicated to war statistics so think about the substance and the overall value of your buck!"
2,Misleading title: There are better books out there.,"Ornery. Cantankerous. On occasion, interesting. Overall, just a quick way for Mr. Vidal to dusty-off some moldy old pieces in exchange for a few bills that were quite happy resting in my wallet. By way of suggestion, you may want to consider ""Reasons to Kill"", by Richard E. Rubenstein - a serious (and conspiracy-free) look at ""perpetual war for perpetual peace""."
3,All Hail The Old Republic!,"In order to fully appreciate and understand Gore, one must remember that he is a nostalgist for the ""failed"" Old Republic; that portion of our nation's history that disappeared forever about the same time Reconstruction collapsed (when Hayes was handed the presidency over Tilden). Thus ended the Jeffersonian ideal of a country of gentleman farmers and began the Carnegie-Rockefeller-Ford reality of the lumpen proletariat hard at factory work (which, of course, segued into FDR's imperial presidency and the Empire itself). This should go a long way towards informing us why Vidal sympathizes as he does with McVeigh (who evidently saw America in a similar vein, albeit, from a post-WWII military perspective). In either case, another hard knock against the corporate capitalist/national security state we have all grown so weary of. A gutsy stand, indeed, though it could all have been said in about half the pages."
4,dear sir,the pakkage arrived in good order in good state thank you very much. i will recomend you in the future
2,"Disappointing, shallow","I bought the book because of its sub-title ""How we got to be so hated"". I expected to find some insights into the fallacies of US foreign policy and how it created much hatred to the US around the world. None of that. Intead, most of the book revolves around the Oaklahoma City bombing and the perceived loss of civil liberties due to the war on terrorism.The author's arguments are shallow, not supported by facts and quite often he resolves to demagoguery and under-the-belt blows to make his point, not very convincingly.That's very disappointing because US foreign policy and its inconsistencies (e.g. advocating democracy and human rights while at the same time supporting oppressive autocratic regimes and states that violate international law) is a great subject for a book and could well indeed explain to the American public ""how we got to be so hated""."
3,not impressed even from a very liberal point of view,"Good book? definitely. Impressed? no. Why?Facts are not as impressive as the author wants itto be. I am liberal as much as the next person,but I can't read blindly. For example: he callsUS operation after 1991 typhoon a military warlike operation. I am from Bangldesh. It was nota military oppresive operation. That was trulya humatarian operation."
3,are you getting your money's worth?,"It's such a short little whiffle of a notion of a book that $... seems a bit steep. Still, it IS GV and I have yet to read any of his nonfiction that didn't resonate with me. I don't know; save your money and buy the United States collection of essays, instead."
4,8 chapters,"This small book gives a good, handbook-style, overview of the civil rights struggle in America, from slavery up to 1965. Helpful in school because it has some primary sources and questions about them"
2,Worse than not working,"This stuff not only didn't work at all for me (though I only tried it in one very old Chevette), it made things worse.I was always dealing with very foggy/wet interior windows (especially in wet winter weather) and tried this stuff out. It just didn't work. And before I could sort of wipe off the windows with a paper towel and I'd be OK, but now the water wouldn't wipe up, it just sort of smeared and stayed wet (like a mix of oil and water would)."
2,Wrong Cushion,My cushion arrived quickly but it wasn't the beautiful cushion that was pictured in the add. It was a horrible-looking thing with a big blue flower print on it. I wasn't too happy but decided not to send it back because it wasn't that important. I won't be using it very long because it flattens out so much that it's almost like not having a cushion at all. I supposed the nice looking one that I didn't receive would have been just as uncomfortable.
2,Charger is good but 50% battery failure after only a few cycles,"Batteries were handled gently, but one died on 4th recharge. The recharger is informative and accurately charges. Too bad batteries or quality control is junk."
4,Minimal and futuristic,"This watch is quite easy to read, and the backlight works well for viewing it at night. I would also like to reassure potential buyers that it has the date as well as a seconds feature. However, it does not have an alarm, countdown timer, lap timer, etc. that you would find on a comparably-priced sport watch.Also, to set it, you have to use a toothpick or bent paper clip to push a tiny button on the side, then use the other buttons to set it."
3,Puma Watch,"The watch is very nice, with easy to read numbers and an adequate backlight. I've received qite a few compliments about it.However, it's fairly low on functionality, as it only traccks the time and date, but that doesn't really bother me.The one thing that's been pointed out by the other reviewers and something that I must bring up is that the strap is small. I have an average sized wrist and I'm using the biggest size. I would almost change the title of the watch to Puma TEEN'S Futuristic Watch rather then Men's, as it won't be fitting too many men."
2,I COULD NOT SEE EVERYTIME.. TOO DARK...,"AS SOON AS I GOT THAT, I DOUBTED MY EYE..BECAUSE I COULD NOT SEE THE TIME..TOO DARK..IT WAS JUST FASHION..I COULD NOT LOOK THE TIME.."
5,pro vitsmin hair serum,"I have used this product for 20 years or more when I could find it. I don't know why they quit making it. It is good for all kinds of hair. Even color treated, permed, curly,dry you name it. I just wish I could find it. I have tried others and it is not the same."
3,Discovering aspects of famous people biography writting.,"Like all NPR programs, count on high quality entertainment when listening to this tape. Yet do not be mislead, these are recordings of the biographers, not of the famous subjects on whom they focused. (This is NOT ""on"" nor ""by"" Richard Feynman as one could have misunderstood.)"
1,Overpriced at $0.00,"It's a real time machine to the 80's, if by that you mean the poorest acting, lamest dialog and dumbest cliche gags packed into a movie with an occasional nipple or to to keep the boys interested. I got 55 minutes in, started trying to ffwd to the high points and quickly decided that there weren't any. Hey, taste is subjective, humor especially so, so you might agree with the majority view. Perhaps a couple joints might improve the humor, but at that point drywall seems equally funny."
5,Great blast from the past,I remember watching this back in the 80's. My brother and I always talked about some of the great lines. I've never seen it since until I got a wild hair to check Amazon. I was so happy I bought 2 copies. It really reminds me of a lot I the movies of that time. I had a great time watching this and will share it with friends and family.
5,the Craziest movie ever,"I have been watching this movie since it came out in 1983. I watch it at least 5-7 times a year. Perhaps more. It is a rollercoaster ride of exagerated characters and rock n roll, blues, new wave and punk music that will have you bopping your head and snapping your fingers.It may only be available on VHS. But, you'll thank me for this one. Please put this on DVD."
5,Pure early 80's,"Ah, I long for those ""good old days"". The kids today missed sooooooo many good times. Nobody bothered anyone and everything was cool. Of course, I exaggerate, but it was pretty close to being able to do anything you wanted and being able to enjoy it, without ""the man"" telling you everything that gives pleasure is ""bad"". Teenagers in the ""50's"" had maltshops and school dances, in the ""60's"" it was find a place to lite up,turn on, and drop out, the 70's and 80's we had the Filmore East type places to socialize. Today's youth really have no place to ""hang out"", either they're with parents or in front of the computer. Not very healthy either way. I'll get off my soapbox now. Enjoy!"
1,"Spend your money on the project, not this product","I purchased this product with two goals in mind: to work out a bathroom remodel, and to plan a kitchen redesign. In the furniture section, there is one toilet and no double sink. In the kitchen, there are no sinks shown at all!! This is a joke. What furniture there is tends to ""load"" onto the page at funny angles rather than 45 degree angles so that it would fit in a square room. The developer is very fond of CD racks, though (the library furniture collection has more of these than anything else). Like another reviewer said, the walk through and 3-d is a neat feature (once you figure out how the heck to use it). But who wants to do a walk through of an empty box??????? Old fashioned graph paper and a pencil would do you much better."
2,NOT SUPPORTED,"THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT SUPPORT WIN 2K PLATFORM (EVEN THOUGH THE BOX SAYS WIN-98 OR HIGHER)PLATFORM AND THE COMPANY WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS PRODUCT, THEY TELL YOU TO SPEND MORE MONEY TO UPGRADE TO A MORE EXPENSIVE PRODUCT"
5,Perfect!!!,"I bought this flag as a birthday gift, and I was concerned that it wouldn't arrive in time. But it did, and it is perfect for what I wanted it for! It's the same size as a normal flag (which I was concerned about because I haven't measured a flag lately) and it comes with grommets to attach it to a flag pole - I wasn't expecting that. I don't remember if that was listed in the description or not.This is a great flag with a great story behind it, and I know my sister is going to be thrilled. It's a hard flag to find, so I'm really pleased that I was able to find one that was so perfect for my birthday plans."
4,Good Book,This is was an easy to understand book about dividing things fairly. All of their methods could be applied to real life. Their best method called Adjusted Winner was a great idea.
4,Lovely and refreshing.,I liked this book very much. My favorite pages were 62 and 63. Very thoughtful and special message there for all. The prayer Little One prayed is one to remember. Very lovely and refreshing - a nice break from reality. Thanks to Ann Marquette for giving us this book. I think both children and adults can appreciate it.
5,"Delightful, whimsical, descriptive book for all ages",I could not put the book down! I have purchased the book for my grandchildren for Christmas and believe that they will find it a joy to read. Ms. Marquette makes the characters come alive with her vivid descriptions of them and their actions. I look forward to her next follow-up effort!!
5,The Little One makes a big impression...,I read a book a week throughout the year. I mainly do this to keep somewhat sane as reading relaxes me by taking me away from the everyday madness (and usually into someone else's madness!) This book REALLY takes you away...an incredibly descriptive story that will make you re-think the relationships you have with family and friends.
5,Perfect,Perfect quality for a book of this age. Not a mark on it and it was exactly as described. Very quick processing of my order as well.
5,A highly readable and engaging book on the topic,"This is a highly readable and engaging book on the topic, covering the history of abortion laws from early 1800s to the Clinton years. To explain the legal shifts throughout those 200 years, the authors describe the social, political, religious and scientific forces that have lead up to each turning point, and how those shifts in turn have influenced further shifts in a seemingly never ending chain. They do so by presenting the various sides of the debate in an even-handed and concise manner, without losing depth on the one hand and without getting bogged down with technicalities on the other. What I found of particular interest was the behind-the-scenes debates of the Justices both in Griswold v. Connecticut and in Roe v. Wade that shed light on their final decision."
3,abortion: law and politics,Good overview with a pro choice viewpoint of the ongoing contentious debate centered on Roe and its offspring. Behind the scenes discussion of the legal strategies and the personnel involved. Very readable account.
4,2o melhor da fase,"2o melhor registro da era Lawton, quando o Heep ainda tinha um time de primeira qualidade.A sonoridade mantém o estilo do Firefly. Destaque para os bnus, especialmente Illusion/Masquerade, que percebemos a edio do lanamento original, onde apenas tinhamos Illusion, inserida no LP original. Maquerade foi para o single da época.Todas os discos das primeiras fases do Heep foram relanados com bnus e lines notes que valem muito a pena.4 estrelas porque 5 fica para Firefly."
3,Subpar for this band,"One of the weaker efforts put out by Uriah Heep in the 1970s. Although performances continue to be competent and have even tightened up some from the previous release Firefly, the songwriting and conception suddenly seems to have slipped a little. Not Uriah Heep at its best overall, although this album will grow on you. The closer, ""Choices"" does rank as one of the band's finest lyrical moments."
4,One of Uriah Heep's finest,"John Lawton recorded three studio albums (""Firefly"", ""Innocent victim"" and ""Fallen angel"") with Uriah Heep, and they are all very good. Lawton's voice is powerful and they way he's singing is perfectly suited for hard rock. The material on ""Innocent victim"" is strong, melodic and sometimes influenced by gospel. This album is clearly not the world's most known record but it is certainly a gem for all of us who like hard rock from the 1970's. The approach is different from the bands early days when they often had a tendency to be too loud, too noisy, too rattling."
5,"older choice but wonderful music if you missed this issue, buy it","this alblum was agreat mix of singers and writting skills, the tunes were a whole new veiw on some of their harder rocking songs, but they still leave your ears ringing.. wow"
3,Different flavor,"With this CD I discovered something. Original formula always works better. With Ritchie Kotzen on guitar instead of C.C.Deville it was just a shade weaker. The original line-up still tours together and I see them as often as I can, you just can't beat them. While this CD did have a few really good songs, I just couldn't stand behind it. Of course I have it to complete my collection, but listening to all Poison CD's then listening to this one, you can pick up that something is just off. Great effort, but original is always better."
3,poison's downfall,"I used to have this on tape years ago and found it on sale on Amazon.com. It is an ok disc from Poison, songs are very different from the last disc. Guitarist is much better than original."
1,Nothin' But a Bad Time,"You don't want this. Trust Me. Poison made a good party band. Their ability to headline tours nearly 20 years since their prime will attest to that. However, when they tried to take themselves too seriously, the party was over. With Native Tounge, CC Deville was gone, they brought in a guitar prodigy (Ritchie Kotzen) and they tried to get bluesy. No thanks. Unless you already have Poison's first two partied-up releases, their third so-so release, and you just have plain bad taste in music, leave this turkey in the cut-out bin."
5,"Great Evolution, Great Blues based Rock","I pick up the guitar learning a tune called talk dirty to me (sounds familiar?), then I grew up on the instrument all most in synch with poison's next realeses after look what the cat dragged in. By the time I heard ""Stand"" guitar solo I forgot abouts CC's departure from the band. Ritchie redifins poison sound so much that a lot of ""party hard"" fans may not like. Musicaly is the one I like the most."
2,OKAY!,"I owned this C.D. for A couple of years , and well with the exception oftwo Songs I never cared for the C.D. . It was not the Poison that I fellIn Love with in 1986 ""Look What The Cat Dragged In"" . However like I said two songs on this C.D. I did like , yet ""Stand"" the only one of thetwo that was ever released , or played much of . It is my Opinion thatthe Song "" Bodytalk"" should have been another Hit from this C.D."
3,Give Kotzen a chance!,"I think Poison is the gayest band EVER, however.....Richie Kotzen plays on this cd, so you should check it out for that reason only. This is the only Poison cd that holds any water, thanks to Kotzen."
1,Fondle the Fear,"I bought this book when I heard the author speak, and read it several times over the last couple of years. Enjoyed it so much that this year, I bought copies for all five of my son-in-laws--and told them to share with my daughters. A great way to learn how to reframe what happens in your life."
5,I read it twice.,"Book ReviewThis well-crafted and hilarious book is effortless to read. The author, Richard Stockton, gives you a short, concise empowerment technique, and then follows with hilarious jokes and stories. Through hysterically funny, true stories and laugh-out loud jokes, you get a Three-Step Method to identify your own dreams and stay on track by reframing your fears. I loved his encounter with the meat cleaver-wielding landlord, and the skateboarder riding a tornado. While the author purposefully goes for getting you to laugh every time, I kept thinking, ""I can use this.""In a culture driven by fear, this book will make you feel good."
5,Love Love Love Love Love it!!,"Every night I wash with the Earth Science A-D-E creamy cleanser and then follow up with this toner. I love the look and feel of my skin now! The first time I used the toner the pad was filthy with dirt and make up I had no idea was still there. I thought my face was clean...I thought wrong. My complexion has been a lot clearer since I started using this regimen. I never wanted to use a toner before because I thought it would sting, and I have very sensitive skin. But this is so gentile there is no problem at all. Love it!"
5,Effective neutral toner for mature skin,"I use this toner every other day in order to make my more expensive PCA toner stretch.It is non drying while taking off the last of the day's makeup that was left on by my cleanser.I am sold on this toner and will continue to purchase and use it in the future, it is a verygood value."
3,Light but not effective on acne,"I used this product for about a month or so and it does not seem to help with acne. However, if you are looking for a really light and not drying toner, this works."
2,"Great idea, poor design","This started out as a great little item. I ended up returning it the first time I had to replace the batteries (about 2 months later). Once the old batteries were removed, everything was reset, and I had to reset the time, month, year, and even had to re-calibrate the compass. What a pain, and not worth the money. If I only had to reset the calendar, that would be fine, but having to re-calibrate the compass is a pain."
1,SCAMS!!!!!,"DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE!!!During a free trial they charged my card 104.00 for products that were not ordered and were supposed to be free!!! Trust me on this - these products are no different, Vitamin K, D, Fish oil etc...than you can find at your local store for 1/3 of the price!!!!!!!!RIP OFF!!I was trying to give this product NO Stars!! (but this page would not let me!)"
1,IF I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO I WOULD!!!,This product did absolutely nothing!The direction said to double up on the first 2 weeks thats 6 pills a day. It didn't work for me!
1,never buy their products,"do Not EVER get involved with these people... customer service is atrocious. If you ever want to stop auto shipments, you have to report your card stolen... and move to a new zip code. This is the WORST company I have ever dealt with... not to mention the placebo pills they sent me did nothing as advertised!"
4,Golf pain gone,"The first 6 or so holes of golf for this 54 yr old were very tough, felt like something would snap if I swung hard lol,now after taking for a few weeks I've been even par or 1 over after 5 instead of 5 or 6 over, love it, and I was trying to return because I thought it was doing nothing after 1 week"
1,Buyer Beware!,"These are not ""bins"". They are a three sided box with no front and no lid. As for the lid being sold separately...good luck finding it in Amazon. This does get five stars for the most usless thing on the websight! At $20 with shipping they are no bargain."
5,Fascinating book,"This is a fascinating book. A must read for anyone who enjoys travel writing, is interested in the history of the Middle East, or just wants to read about some-one who thumbed her nose at the ""establishment""! Well written too."
5,freya stark,"the book arrived on time, in great condition. i recommend the seller and the author. freya stark traveled foreign lands before it was a popular thing to do. she documents her journey with incredible insight."
2,Bebob to the Boolean Boogie,"Transport to Holland took quit a while, but I arrived in the promised time. Only the product was sold including CD-Rom. This was not included, the sender new this because the included letter mentioned that the book was delivered without CD-Rom.The book is better than expected, the sender does not responded to my question why the CD-Rom was not included. I am still waiting (Christmas periode might take some extra time).The book quality is ok (used, not damaged)."
5,A goofy yet detailed overview of electronics fundamentals,"This is a great book ranging from the absolute basics of number systems to circuit design, ceramics to alternative and future technologies. It is presented in an entertaining and easy-to-read format that just about anybody can enjoy reading."
4,Shocking,"This is an excellent book written in the form of a memoir. Sue Silverman can weave together words quite eloquently. You can sense her soul as she tell the most horrific abuses she endured at the hands of her own father. It is sad, and will bring tears to even the most hardened of souls. I commend her for being courageous and sharing her most painful moments with us readers. She is worthy of praise."
1,"I Know Its A True Story, But...","I know this is a true story, but it was so boring. The author was beating around the bush in telling the story. The reader just had to really assume what the father was doing to her. I was so frustrated with the book that I never even finished it. When I'm reading I want the whole story; do not beat around the bush with me. I tried very hard to stay focused. I read two long chapters and I couldn't take it anymore. Sorry, but it didn't keep my attention.Later..."
5,Outstanding Book on a Horrifying Topic,"As someone who grew up in a similar fashion I was riveted by this book. Written in clear, clean, spare prose Sue William Silverman probably had such a cathartic experience writing this book and then gives to others by sharing her story. Ms Silverman really gets it right when describing the toxic mix of terror and need that are central to many of us who lived in this way. My own life and healing are enhanced by this volume. This book should be read by survivors, those who work with them and anyone in any kind of relationship with them. This is so highly recommended for anyone on this kind of journey."
5,A Stunning Memoir,"I bought this book with hesitancy due to what I thought would be wading through the horrors of family incest, however; Silverman writes with such beautiful prose she makes the subject remain heartwrenching, yet readable in one of those books that does not come along very often. Her account is horrific and not for the faint of heart, but the writing and her courage to to endure and survive the atrocities of her childhood give the reader faith in how strong the human spririt can truly be. An amazing story told by an amazing woman who is obviously also a very gifted writer."
3,nit good for kindle,"I have the kindle edition of this book. It has no text to speach so I can't set it up to read to me when I'm cooking or in the bath tub. The text is really snall and I have to srtain to see it. Ihe information is great, I just recomend buying the papperback not the kindle version."
2,Fluke 971,"I am an HVAC contractor and check condenser charges multipe times a day. My 971 is off by 4.7 degrees on dry bulb and I now question if the wet bulb reading is correct. I have owned this meter for less that 2 years and I am displeased that it has gotten out of calibration or the capacitance sensor is out all ready. I sent Fluke an email asking what the cost of repair is, have not gotten a reply yet. I must buy another for my business and cannot wait for the time span of repair. I am looking at an Extech RH350. I thought fluke was more dependable and reliable, but i was wrong."
2,not happy,"i am a hvac contractor.i bought this a year or so ago through a wholesale hvac shop. i started having doubts about it bcs i use several fluke 50/2s and a 922 all at the same time and the 971 is always off by five or more degrees. i only use it for wb but like the other reviewer im not sure its correct as the temp is way off when all meters are compared at the same location. i usually get them all normalized for 15 minutes or so in the same place to get them on the same plane. i even compaired them all with the k couple on my digital manifold (mastercool) and all jive but the 971? if this was a cheap meter i would say ""man i wished i had bought a fluke"". guess again....."
1,Beware!!! Fluke is an awful company with zero customer service,Beware buying Fluke products. If you have a part malfunction they will ignore you. They have zero customer service basically just automated email responses that tell you that they have no interest in helping you.I REFUSE TO EVER PURCHASE ANOTHER FLUKE PRODUCT!!!
1,slow response time,"This electronic gage has a slower response time to temperature changes than a $3 hardware store thermometer. Test Equipment Depot was excellent to deal with, shipped me a second unit, it was unsatisfactory too. T.E.D. refunded my funds in short order."
5,Pre-Publication,"I am a student that is in the age range of this book, and I was given the opportunity to read bits of it before Publication. After I did so, I noticed that Mr. Husle's ideas were dead on. I started noticing different behaviors of the peers that I associated with, and I could place these idividuals with ideas from the book. I have recently ordered my copy and can't wait to read the completed book."
1,I read it and I know him,"Many of the points he makes make sense, however the application and the way you deal with people matter more. Everything is not black and white. I question how many years the author has worked with at risk teens. I feel that it may be few. I would like to see him write again after he has been seasoned in dealing with this age group. I am sorry to say I wonder who should get a clue."
5,cute hat,This hat has lasted over a year and a half without getting stains. Because it is so cute and unique we always get compliments. The hat just makes others smile. Its very warm and soft.
1,shrinkage of wrist cooler,"I used the wrist coolers once with satisfaction. When I went to use them a second time, it was impossible to connect the velcro as the bands had shrunk. Very dissatisfied."
3,Controversial book on literacy,"We are reading this book for a literacy methods class. The style is redundant and reminiscent of listening to a very boring lecture. He has some very harsh things to say about phonics education, which is controversial but not altogether bad."
4,Strong Ideas Presented Well,"This book debunks any number of assumptions about reading. The chapter on phonics is a must read for anyone who belives that 'sound it out' makes sense. He looses a star for not citing his sources, which would be helpful. The lack of notations takes some of the authority out of his otherwise passionate defense of sensible reading instruction."
4,Great book!,This book really helped me to understand more about teaching reading and about the theories behind teaching reading. i would recommend it ot everyone.
2,not a great read,This was not a great read but it did have some very interesting thought however it was hard to get into
2,Based on Fallacy that reading IS natural!,"Spelling and reading have only been around for about 5000 years. Language is innate because it has been around for 30,000 to 40,000 years. Spelling and reading aren't natural. Ask any dyslexic. If we treat all children as if the act of reading is natural and they'll just 'soak' it up... then we are dooming 15-20% of them to failure. Both basal and whole language programs FAIL these children. Wake up and teach them, please.Check out realspelling.com with Melvyn Ramsden. Spelling is cognitive in conception and execution. TEACHING IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR MANY STUDENTS'SUCCESS."
4,unjustly maligned record,"I am surprised at the beating the Quintessence releases have received. Stan and his band are in fine form, so even without Chet Baker this would be a solid CD. True, Chet's contributions are minimal in parts but he gets plenty of opportunities to shine--and Getz rarely steps over him, as many have stated. Perhaps the knowledge of underlying tension between Getz and Baker cause many to not listen with an open mind. That would be a shame, since even though Getz/Baker were not a match made in heaven as it would have seemed, this release is a valuable document of a collaboration that would soon end--much to the dismay of this listener."
3,No One's Best Work,"Quintessence (Vol. 2)This album includes some very good jazz, but also some very mediocre solos and at least one poor performance. Stan Getz rarely embarrasses himself and doesn't do that here. His solos are as fluent and original as you would expect. I would rate Chet Baker's solo work as listenable to uninspired and lacking energy. Jim McNeely was a highly regarded pianist as a sideman, arranger, leader and teacher, but one important solo on this album was, unfortunately, quite notable for its lack of quality. In the first solo on Sonny Rollins' jazz classic, Airegin, McNeely struggles mightily to maintain the normal but brisk pace set by the opening chorus. The content suggests a far less mature and original player, and certainly not worthy of the leaders of this group. There is some good music here, but for me that is not what is memorable about this album."
2,PUT OUT THIS FIRE,"NATURE UNLEASHED has given us avalanches, tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanoes and now fire. This is probably the least effective of the series. The villain is a Michael Myers like creature out for revenge on the park ranger who prevented him from stealing gold from a wornout mine. The fire scenes are CGI crafted and aren't that impressive; most of the characters are cardboard and not too likeable and ""star"" Bryan Gennesse chews up the scenery badly. For firebugs only."
5,Great!,I took this at the suggestion of my Dr. it did what it was suppose to do and gave meAlot more energy too.
4,An excellent mix of parody and rock!,"From the first song, ""Black Dog,"" this CD is great. Led Zeppelin lyrics set to reggae music with Elvis singing the words. Make this your first Dread Zeppelin CD, as it has some of the most original mixes to some songs that have been around for ages. ""Heartbreaker"" is their #1 crowd pleaser, and ""Moby Dick"" has some wonderful ad-libbing by ""Tortelvis"" himself."
1,Undreaded,"I took a shot at this CD based on the reviews, hey the used ones were cheap, but I didn't like it. I'm a Zep & Elvis fan, but not a Bob Marley fan, maybe that's why I found the Reggae & Hindu beats ponderous. The goofy sound effects were a bit too much for me-they took me right out of the music and sound like something a stoned pothead would want to listen to while smokin' his stuff. There's something strangely natural about a combination of Elvis & Led Zeppelin, maybe it's because Zep loved to do the King's songs at their live shows, I dunno, but this CD would have appealed to me more if it had been done as a straight up Elvis impression of Zeppelin songs without the sound effects, breaks, and nonsense. The band seems to have the skills to sound good, they just waste their talent on this half-baked album."
1,its awful,Led zepplin wannabes they are so stupid I think they should get a life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,10 Years After...,"An indication of a musical ""classic"" in any genre is how well it holds-up over time. It's been at least a decade since I last heard Un-Led-Ed, but today it managed once again to make me tap my foot while laughing out loud. Weird Al can't do it. Not Spinal Tap. Forget the Ruttles.Dread Zep really wails-away with serious renditions of Led Zep's Best, then just when you're hooked they let it unwind into a nosedive of reggae-Elvis nonsense.It's a decade-old musical food-fight, and I love-it.Ed has NOT left the Building!........Bob"
4,Best Parody Album in my playlist,"I'm hooked, but it's kind of a trifecta for me - Elvis, Zepplin, and reggae. What's not to love?Well, unless you're not into one of the triumverate mentioned above, or don't have a sense of humor about them.But it's worth a spin - the Dreads and Tortelvis are musically talented, and , context aside, the album's got a good beat, and you can really bug out to it.It would be 5 stars, but that would require a guest appearance from either the King, John Bonham, or Bob Marley."
5,get this,So you wanna hear Elvis doing Led Zeppelin ala reggae. Then get this. You will not be disappointed. This brings the best elements of the mentioned above and blended beautifully. Get this either way.
3,Call their Customer Service First,This product builds you up with alot up marketing. It then shuts you down after needing answers not supplied in weak user's guide. Call Customer service. I did. Send them an email. I did. No response from either attempt at contacting them. Hey? Take a chance if you don't believe me. This is just my personal experience. I'm taking my copy back for a refund. That my punch!
2,annoying,"While the box looks pretty good, it mostly delivers confusion. Like any 3D program it will take a lot of computer to run the program quickly in 3D, which can be annoying after spending an hour designing your house. The symbols for furniture, fixtures and cabinets often insert at odd angles and are almost impossible to get squared up with the walls. I have even had a bug where it will not display all colors in the 3D mode (you enter you roof and wall colors). Looked good in 2D, but everything was shades of green in 3D. My advise: save your money and buy some graph paper and a pencil. This is a sketching program only, and it doesn't do it very well."
4,Okay for beginners....,"This is the first home planning software I've ever bought. I found most of it difficult to use until I got accustomed to the program. There are some features I wish it had such as more 'undo' options and more home plans. I wouldn't have bought it if I'd known beforehand that it only had 20+/- of it's own house plans that you could alter. Several other similar programs boast 100's of home plans that you can alter to your tastes. Regardless, it's a good program if you want to be able to ""build"" your home, design the interior, and landscape the outside and fairly simple to use."
2,roofs and walls,"I was initially excited at how easy it is to create a structure, and indeed that is this program's strength. But as I used it more, I became more disappointed. Roofs are poorly done. You'll notice that all the samples have the same roof lines. You cannot create true gables. You cannot create anything pretty much out of the ordinary in fact. Try drawing a barn for example. And walls are a problem when you want anything that is not ordinary. Try drawing a knee wall. You cannot specify individual wall height. They have a good concept and an easy api, but ease of use is no substitute for basic features. I am disappointed."
2,Just a toy; a broken toy,"I really hate to be so critical but the thing with Punch is they promised so much and just didn't deliver. One reviewer mentioned that they offer a nice variety of doors, windows, etc. Well, there were three deck shapes to choose from. Is that Variety? And while you could adjust the shapes somewhat, I couldn't get it to accept exact measurements. Now how can you build something without exact measurements? Oh, did I mention I live on a slope? Punch doesn't do decks on a slope. Everytime I tried to adjust the deck to the slope - it started to build a house with a basement. There were only a few stair types and only 1-2 places I could place the stairs. Forget about stairs with a landing that change direction. And all the stairs had fixed heights - which is really ridiculous. This software was time consuming and a waste of money.Let me add, I did not try the scanning feature - so I can't say how that works."
3,DISAPPOINTING,"At first I really liked the program. Some features are good such as the drag and drop windows and doors, textures, colors, etc. But I quickly found limitations. The program won't do dormers, although you can get a free download that draws one puny dormer that comes with only one roof pitch. If you use other than that one pitch, the dormer doesn't line up with the house roof.It won't do crawl spaces, circular stairs, and you can't change the color or texture of cathedral ceilings, which are another story. I got it to draw a gable roof with a cathedral ceiling once but then it stopped working. It will only do hip roofs regularly in cathedralThe instructions are terrible, although product support is good. I got email response in a couple of hours.Overall, I was disappointed and returned the program. I am looking for something else."
2,Too many frustrations!,"At first this program seemed like it'd work great, but the further I got into it, the more frustrated I got. Getting the perimeter walls to meet so it wouldn't put ""grass"" inside my house was a nightmare, and when I finally got that fixed, it wouldn't recognize inside walls from outside (so I had brick walls inside my house)! I'm sure someone more tech-saavy than me could figure it out, but I bought it because it said it was easy and quick to learn - it's not. I am returning mine and getting a simpler program - the extra features this one offers are NOT worth the frustration and hassle of dealing with it!"
1,Walls and Roofs very limited ... got my money back!,"I bought this hoping to do some remodeling renderings of my house. My house has all vaulted ceilings. There is not one roof in this program that would work on any part of my house. All of the roof lines are A-frame. There is no way to have a wall that is not a perfect rectangle. Almost all walls in my home are not. So this program was completely useless.Look at all the example plans in the program. None of them have any out of the ordinary roofs or walls.The update on the website has one roof that is called a 'shed'. It was a joke. No help at all. If are going to create a design that has anything that is unique or out of the ordinary, skip this program."
4,"Not so easy to use, but very powerful","I downloaded the demo version and played with it for a couple of days. It can be very frustating to use this tool in the beginning but once you get a hang of it, it is very nice. I designed a couple of different plans and was very excited to see the 3D view. This too, with the limited version that I had. Many of the features were not available since I was just trying a demo. I also downloaded the 3D home design and tried it for a couple of weeks. Although 3D Home design is easy to use, I like Punch.I just bought the copy on ebay and now eagerly waiting it to arrive."
3,Fun and Disappointing,"This program is fun. I built my current house to see how the house would look remodeled. The graphics were good. Easy to use. A couple of things ticked me off. The ability to cut or edit a wall once it is drawn. The roof tool is great if you have only a few types of roofs. You can only change the pitch and sizes. Did they even consider Saltboxes? porch roofs? Hey how about the ability to customize or edit, wallpaper, doors, floors, sidings."
1,NT Users Beware,"I have a fairly high-speed NT system, and although the 3.51 product is advertised as being compatible with NT, it's not. The software completely hangs up my computer every time I do a 3-D viewing. Customer service was polite, but useless. I'm glad there's a money-back warrantee!"

3,That's entertainment!,"This is an interesting premise and Burt Lancaster is as usual, superb. That said, this film is monutmentally depressing, made all the more so by the fact that as things progress they go steadily downhill.Add to this schlockmeister supreme Martin HAMlisch's overpowering score and, well, things can't get much grimmer.What can I say? Fire up the popcorn and remember things always appear darkest before going entirely black."
5,Top Notch DVD Release,"The Swimmer is a excellent quality DVD. Remastered in High Definition, Anamorohic Widescreen and Dolby Digital Sound. This is a real treat for fans of Burt Lancaster who have waited for this DVD release. This is the standard by which all DVD's should be measured."
5,unusual movie,Different and unusual movie.Burt Lancaster gives a wonderful performance.Based on John Cheever short story.Not the kind of movie that would be made or seen today.Terrific music score by Marvin Hamlisch.Sad and depressing but story will haunt you for a long time...
1,misleading,"The seller made was on the DVD movie purchase site with this musical score only for the movie, misleading had to return after some hassle to do so."
3,needs better description,"Neither the description nor the pages on the ""view inside this book"" section explain that this book is about a father dying. I'm sure it would be helpful in that situation, but with small children that are dealing with the death of a grandparent, the last thing they need is to gain a new fear of their father dying. For an older child or for a child who has just lost a parent it would probably be good, but for other situations, not so much. The book description needs to be much more specific."
5,The Essential Mark Ryden Book,"Although long out-of-print, this is the essential Mark Ryden book for collectors. It contains all of the now classic images including many images from when he was working as a commercial illustrator. These are in a nice large format and I've seen people even take pages out of the book to try and sell as prints. His other book Fushigi Circus has a good selection but the format is too small for my liking, so Anima Mundi is well worth the collector's price."
1,Awfully boring,"I read this because the author was born near where I live, and is a well-known Iowa author. It tells of a minister and his family coming to the new Iowa town and staying two years. There is nothing except blandness for the first 200 pages and very little excitement even after that. Most of the time is spent telling how a six year old boy is infatuated by the minister's six year old daughter. Other than being bored spitless by the non-happenings related, one can revel in what life was like before cars in an Iowa small town. There will be no shock to your sensibilities in this book, and when you get to the last page you will be glad so that you can read something less bland."
5,At last,"I love this brush becuse of its material. The silicone is easy to work with and the stainless handles means it's diswasher safe. You don't get stray bristles in your food and it doen't come out of the dishwasher with a bad hair day like traditional bristles. The handle is full and rounded, so it feels good in your hand. It took me four tries before I got the right brush and I'm very happy with this purchase. I have both the basting and the pastry brushes."
3,Why buy it alone?,"Norton System Works 2000 has this along with Ghost 2000, Antivirus 2000, Utilities 2000 and the latest CrashGuard for just a few dollars more. Get it all. It's one of the best software packages out there."
5,Norton CleanSweep 4.7,"Great uninstaller programme, It found a lot of junk files, Invalid registries and with the cool traffic light like result and a backup option. I did not know my system had so many wasted files."
5,Excellent low cost receiver,The HK 144 receiver has excellent sound with tight natural bass. I have been an audiophile for over 30 years and this receiver is among the best I've owned. The functions are user friendly and it has a look of understated quality. A great heart to a quality theatre system in a small to medium listening enviroment.
5,Extradinary read,This group of 9-11 rescuers did a valiant job and did not get enough nationwide credit for their heroic deeds during this brutal tragedy. They are to be commended and should be recognized by all. Well written Zeev Breier.
2,Caution about the Title,"When I purchased this book (incidentally, it's a paperback), I believed that it would be a history of Stewart and Hyder. Actually, it is more of a church history of Stewart and Hyder. It was interesting to browse through since I had visited this area, but I was more interested in the town history rather than religious activity in the area.It's a paperback book, the cover is a color aerial view of Hyder and Stewart, there are some black and white photos in the book."
5,Absolutely lovely,"This CD is the best collection of Japanese lullabies/children's songs I have come across. Both the singing and the koto accompaniment have a beautiful dreamlike quality. I also appreciate that many of the songs are sung both in Japanese and English, which helps introduce Japanese to my American-born children."
5,Exquisite Japanese Lullabys,"What a great cd! This is my second purchase, this time to gift to a friend. The singing is easy and comforting--like my own mother sang to me many, many years ago. It was after watching a Japanese movie where an old man hauntingly hummed ""Komuriuta"" that had me searching for a Japanese children's album that led to here. The simple accompaniment by a koto is all a lullaby needs. And songs like ""Furusato"" took me back to a home that I had long forgotten. On many levels, this will appeal to adults who had Japanese mothers who wish to share that history with their own children. It makes for perfect listening after a hectic day in the office, a stress-reliever on the drive home, or something to listen to on a rainy Saturday."
5,Pleased,I am very pleased with the CD. The songs are mixed with english and japanese. I went online and found the words for the CD and sing to my daughter. My older daughter (12) enjoys listening to the CD.
5,"A story filled love, tears, and a beautiful ending","Savannah Rose is a lady of wealth , power and saddness she has her best friend Elaina yet she looks for love all over the world only to find it in a southern man whom lives in Philadelphia, the city of her birth she has long ago left behind. Cooper wants a southern woman for his wife . The Story has many surprises , tears, and a love that is so powerful it overcomes so many problems a person has to wonder how such a love ever came to be. Set in the early 1900's this story is the second blood line of the Lawley, Ayers Saga that began with the Novel Leaves Of Change. Ms. Robertson is a powerfull writer I am looking forward to her last book of the set due out late 2006. I know the last book will be as powerfu as the first two."
5,Big Fan Of The Gospel Keynotes,I'm a very big fan of the Gospel Keynotes. Several of my albums were destroyed in a fire and I'm looking to rebuild my collection of the Gospel Keynotes. I'm hoping to be able to purchase this The Best of Willie Neal Johnson and The Gospel Keynotes soon.
5,Wonderful for Halloween or any time.,"This book is absolute fun for parents and children alike. Not only are Ms. Thompson's illustrations lovely, but her story is funny. I had the pleasure of meeting her and having our copy signed recently, and can say that she is a kind person as well as an entertaining story teller. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to show their children that there is nothing to be afraid of in the dark."
2,Not very kid friendly,"My eight year old son has a great interest in cooking, is a good reader, and a very knowledgable computer nerd :-). But even so, this CD was poorly organized and required constant intervention and help from me. We both quickly lost interest. My son learns more about cooking and recipes from watching the cooking section on ""ZOOM"". This was a real disappointment because I use DVO's Recipe/Meal Planner software and was very impressed with that. However, this is not the same quality as the adult software DVO makes."
3,Only for Egyptian Arabic,"The book is good if you want to learn Egyptian Arabic. However, after trying out some of the phrases with Arab friends from other countries, I was told that many of these words are very local to Egypt and qualify as 'slang'. For instance the word for car in the book is Arabiya, whereas the more commonly used word is Sayyara. Several such differences can be found throughout the book."
5,The best available,"This is a great introduction for the Arabic language. The Egyptian language is THE most understood all over the Arab world, because of the media production (Egyptian films , series..etc) . The tapes are informative, and the phrases will get you talk the language people speak , and not a language dug down from old poet ! The fastest way to communicate !I recommend also Eurotalk Talk now Arabic SW"
2,Good Audio But Meaningless Phrases Translation,Beginners would find this egyptian dialect helpful. But only for the audio part. What's lacking is the book translation of phrases. Those already very familiar with arabic script would find the phrases difficult to figure out because they are written using the roman or english alphabets. Letters in arabic are absolutely different in sounds than english. The author would have realized it. Its meaningless without the arabic script.
4,great product,My husband says it was very easy to install.Could have had a few more clamps in the corners. It looks good. It had a few mars on the finish but I didn't want to send it back. They are not that noticeable.
5,Absolutely wonderful,"You can't go wrong with these books! I thought after receiveing them that my son might not like them because they don't have that ""new"" look of more modern books. No bright pages or colorful illustrations. But I was very wrong. My kids love these books and they help with struggling readers in a way you can't even imagine. The pages are sequenced in such a manner that they make sense to little ones beginning to read. I love them and will teach all four of my children to read using these books!"
4,Back to basics,I bought these for a friend who teaches an intro to teaching course. He uses them to emphasize a back to basics approach to reading and values. The binding is sturdy but a bit cheaper and flashier than I anticipated.
5,awesome reading !,"I am now 21 and when I was homeschooled these are the books my parents used,they are great! There are values in these books that are not found in the books used in the public school system( I attended public schools as well) and now that my parents are getting back into homeschooling my siblings we can use nothing else but McGuffey's Readers."
4,Good Show,"This is a pretty decent album. Lucky Dube is real, roots reggae. He can wail with the best of 'em and he's NOT Bob Marley (what?! there's other reggae out there!? OMG!). On one of the tracks he hiccups a bit, which is funny... Lucky! Were you DRINKING during the show!? If you like reggae, and not just so you can include ""No Woman No Cry"" in your mix tapes to show how much soul you've got, this is one for the collection."
5,Great album!!!,"It amazes me that Timbuk 3 never got popular recognition for anything but ""The Future's So Bright"". While that was a catchy tune, it was certainly not their best. They were the most consistent band I know of. Virtually EVERYTHING they put out was great, including this, possibly their best in a string of great albums. Great music, intelligent lyrics, how they remained so obscure is beyond me.One truly amazing thing about ""Edge Of Allegiance"" is that this is a politically inspired album that was written and released 20+ years ago, yet the subject matter could have been written yesterday. Fantastic! If you like great music, you will love Timbuk 3. One of my all time favorite albums - and bands."
5,Taking Our Cities For God,Excellent book to read which helps you with the spiritual boundaries that are in our cities and it helps you to understand more on how you can reach out to people in your own city
1,Time to bury this body...,"Detective Inspector Carol Ashton is a protaganist who has outlived her plot. This story's ending was so abrupt and illogical, it left this reader feeling disappointed and betrayed.And speaking of betrayal, ever since Carol parted ways with her better half, Sybil, several episodes ago, this series has been heading down hill. It would be merciful if McNab would wrap up this project and put it to rest. That would leave her more time to develop her other series starring Denise Cleever who, unlike Carol, still has a heart."
1,Let Carol Ashton Die with Dignity,"I hate it when a good character gets boring, and that's what has happened to poor Detective Inspector Carol Ashton. I think this series either needs to retire or be reborn. Actually it could have stopped several books before. What happened to Carol? She use to be intriguing, multidementional, not to mention sexy. Now we the typical Niad 200 page, spit out another of a series of watered down (maybe edited out), over priced piece of junk. My hope is when number 14 shows up I have enough sense to hold on the my money."
3,good solid fixed fan,"A good, solid fan, appears well made with either wall or ceiling mount. Good level of power. But does not have oscillation option. Does not include lag bolts need to fix it to the wall."
3,Not suitable for the short on patience.,"A lot of topics are coevered, some are even quite interesting. The code is buggy and some of the explainations don't match the code. Unless you're experienced enough and missing some basic knowledge on some specific issues, don't bother with this one."
5,Great Stuff,I have used this supplement for the last 4 years with GREAT RESULTS!! When I started I was a 125. lb weakling!!4 years later I'm a 250 lb. linebaker who easily benches 300lbs!!Enough said!!
2,Old shows,"Upon reviewing this product one would think that the videos would be relativly new. However, they are videos of a home improvement show that aired in the mid 80's and didn't provide any insight to new techniques and current tools."
4,Power Source,It is good to have two controls on the same uint. It could be improved by bumping it from 16VA to 18VA. It runs my trains nicely.
3,More Full Shots Desired,"I loved the photo's. The quality is exquisite. The detail offered in the commentary regarding background on the actual articles was a very nice surprise, and really made me feel connected to the pieces. However, I longed to see full shots of the articles themselves, and not just the close-ups of sleeves, trims, and selected tailoring. That was the only thing missing. The colors in the shots and the detail in the drawings certainly were worth the cost of the book. I would recommend it highly. I would also love to see a follow-up edition showing 360 degree photos of the articles themselves(and others)to complete the experience. Although, I know that would make for a very large, expensive volume. I would buy it. I did have to wait over 8 weeks for my book to arrive, but that is another review altogether.Nineteenth Century Fashion in Detail"
5,Stupid Amazon!,"Don't bother ordering this through Amazon - They're out of stock and haven't been able to get more copies since February. My order keeps being delayed the day that it lists that it's supposed to ship. It's more expensive elsewhere, but at least you've got the option of actually getting it. I broke down and paid double the price listed by Amazon just so that I could stop waiting for it to arrive each month.I've heard this is a fantastic reference. Now if only I could get a copy!"
2,Nineteenth Century Fashion Disasters...,No...have seen other books with MUCH better detail AND descriptions. Very unsatified with the quality of details in this book. Anyone wanna buy mine?
5,Helpful in Historic Interpretations,"I do historic interpretations at a couple of historic homes in my area, and I'm asked questions about what I'm wearing. This book helped to fill in more details for a better presentation."
5,Fabulous,I have enjoyed this book very much. I love fashion and history. The book arrived quickly and is exactly as I expected. I would recommend this to anyone that shares the same interests.
2,A BIG Let Down!,This big glossy picture book is a big let down because all it shows is parts and pieces of garments. The details are useless without getting to see the effect on the whole garment. Who needs a book filled with collar and cuff close-ups? If you are looking for great pictures of 19th century dress- This is NOT the book for you!
2,This is rather dull...,"After having heard Strange Cargo III, I thought I should try out the original Strange Cargo, but it is surprisingly mediocre. It makes good background music (i.e. elevator music). It's just too understated, not *out there* enough. Don't buy this if you're hoping for the more recent William Orbit sound."
5,Best Family or Homeschool Resource!,"I have used this resource for over 9 years and finally had to buy a new one. It is my very favorite for my little ones (3 to 8) for character training / building. The stories are short, and to the point, and for the kids who can't sit still, it is so helpful to be able to photocopy a coloring page from the story each day, to help keep them quiet and listening while mom reads. Each section comes with a specific character quality, its definition, a relevant Bible verse, and then a story demonstrating that quality in the Bible, at home, at school and at play. A little Bible study and question section is written at the end of each character quality. It packs a big, powerful punch for all ages. Mom and older kids are equally convicted!"
5,History of Popular Women's Magazines,This work is wonderful. It started as a dissertation and grew into a great source book and a wonderful history of Popular Women's Magazines in the U.S. I found it engaging and useful. Ms Zuckerman has made her research into a really good read. This book examines the start of trends in the US publishing business that have continued to this day. The role of woman as consumer was crafted early on in the 20th century and has changed the role of women in our society dramatically.
5,Best since the 7th,"Perhaps the best effort of Steppenwolf since the legendary 7th album, which is the peak of their career and should be considered as as a standard - to evaluate any ""stoner"". Want to listen to real acid/hard rock? Buy that one (but first the 7th -Steppenwolf 7), the band is a bit tired, but still it's an accomplished, aggressive and self-sufficient music. Buy the book by John Kay too - must (Magic Carpet Ride: The Autobiography of John Kay and Steppenwolf. Keep in mind that this is one of the best acts in the history of hard rock, and that the tem ""heavy metal"" came from ""Born to Be Wild"" by Steppenwolf... May God bless Steppenwolf for guidance and inspiration!"
5,Pajama Party,"This is the absolute cutest movie i have ever seen! Tommy Kirk is so the cat's pajamas! a cutie! totally! and annette is adorable as well! see this movie, you won't regret it! that is... if you want harrison ford, see air force one. he isn't in this movie. sillyhead."
2,Not the best beach movie...,"Most of the beach party movies were awesome--- Beach Party, Muscle Beach Party, Bikini Beach, Beach Blanket Bingo, even How to Stuff a Wild Bikini. However, this one was just random...Annette was Dee Dee in all the others--- in this, she was Connie. Frankie barely got a part at all, and she was dating Jody McCrea; as Big Lunk, no less--- not even the loveable DeadHead. And, then Tommy Kirk. Now, I love Tommy Kirk, and I even loved he and Annette together in the Merlin Jones flicks. However... this one can't be lumped in with the other beach party movies. It just... CAN'T...And, that is for the simple reason that it's totally different characters, different storylines, ect. It was like some sort of bizarre nightmare one of them may have been having..."
4,Tops and Bottoms,"While Frankie went off to make SKI PARTY, Annette made PAJAMA PARTY. Buster Keaton, Don Rickles and Elsa Lancester added to the usual beach gang adds up to infectious fun in Panavision and Pathecolor. Grab your PJs and let's go."
4,Confused?,"You may be baffled by the lineup on this ""Beach"" movie - while Annette is back in her ""DeeDee"" role, she's now ""Deadhead's"" (Jody McCrea) girlfriend rather than Frankie's. Frankie, meanwhile, takes the role of a Martian military commander (you can tell it's Mars because they used a red filter over the camera lens!) - maybe after playing ""Potato Bug"" in ""Bikini Beach"" he thought he was stretching his chops. Tommy Kirk is, not surprisingly, uneasy in his role as the Martian sent to Earth by Frankie to hang out with Annette and various other nubile females. Things are marginally improved by the antics of Buster Keaton, Dorothy Lamour appears long enough to sing a tune, and Elsa Lanchester does her patented airheaded-old-lady act to perfection. Harmless nostalgic fun, but whoever made this page, and thinks this movie is rated ""R"", is insane. Strictly G-rated stuff - it IS 1964, after all!"
1,Where are the pajamas?,We had a pajama party and I thought this would be a fun film for the background...no one was seen wearing pajamas!!??
5,Superb,"The Intention Experiment is a superb book for reinforcing the new consciousness. It is a wonderful combination of the science and the gut level experiential learning in our lives. Having read in the areas of quantum physics and the Law of Attraction for over thirty years, this book is right up there with Wayne Dyer, Deepak Chopra, Fred Alan Wolf, Gregg Braden, Esther Hicks, and of course, The One Command by Asara Lovejoy."
2,"Thorough in its evidence, dissapointing in it's utilitarian value","I purchased the book hoping for some insight into the process of directing intention for my personal development. After all, the title includes the very active statement of ""using your thoughts to change your life and the world"".But it does not deliver on that front. It spends most of it's time literating the evidence of intention as a testable element within the realm of science. On that front, the book is well thought out and convincing and is an excellent primer for the skeptical or uninitiated.But for those of us who are already the converted, i felt it lacked a firm direction for it's reader past the evidence and into practice. The usable portion of the book occupies the final chapter, which, in my opinion, misrepresents what the title promises."
4,Inspirational and a bit dry at times,"As a Reiki practitioner it was really gratifying to read about experiments proving that alternative healing modalities such as Reiki have been shown scientifically to be valid. I found the first chapter in this book to be a challenge because they described experiments in such mind-numbing detail, listing all the credentials of each of the scientists, etc. But once I got to the second chapter the book began to take on a more ""human"" narrative. So, for those of you who choose to read this book that aren't into the left-brain minutia, push through and get to later sections. I found this book to be very inspirational and affirming for what I've always known to be true: We are co-creators of the world around us. We influence everything, even from great distances. We have the power to heal or destroy and it's up to us to choose which intention we choose in every moment."
3,heard most of this before,"Let me start by saying that I am a McTaggart fan. However, if you've read a few books on quantum physics, you will already be familiar with the direction of the research anecdotes that fill the first 11 chapters of the book. Yes, we know by now our minds influence our realities. I don't need all this convincing.Since I subscribe to McTaggart's ""Intention Experiment"" newsletter, chapters 12, 14, and 15 were also not new information. I skimmed parts of the book and really only read chapter 13, the ""Intention Exercises"" which comprised a scant 13 pages of tips for optimal intention conditions. This section was helpful, but superficial when compared to the depth she spent on the first 12 chapters leading up to it.Unfortunately, I ordered McTaggart's ""Living with Intention"" CD set before reading this book, and now I'm not sure I want to hear the CDs if she's just going to keep rehashing the same stuff. When the set arrives, I may just send it back."
4,I like this book,"This is a well written and researched work. I will however admit that Lynne McTaggarts: ""The Field"" is, imo, still her best work and my personal favorite."
4,Scientific focus on spirituality,"I am interested in spirituality-that there is something beyond the material. However, I like logic and evidence based information, this book does both. I am not a scientist and know nothing about physics. It is not an easy read and somewhat technical but isn't dry. It is an approachable book. The idea we can heal with thought is inspiring and the evidence the book presents makes it more...valid."
3,the Intention Experiment,"I am drawn to books of this nature yet I find that they are at times lacking.Now I realize that reading books give you only one point of view, you have to experience things yourself or the books are just words.Though I like this book I found that reading Ms. McTaggart's first book was enough.We can read all the books in the world about Intention but unless we experience it first hand it is only a story."
2,Not a self help book but interesting-mostly scientific,"Don't buy this book if you want a step by step kind of help. This book has scientific proof of how thoughts can change our environment or bodies. It has many studies written on it, but only one chapter has actual exercises(brief) that one can do to 'use thoughts to change your life'. After reading 10+ chapters I was disappointed, expecting a grand finale full of exercises for me to use personally. True throughout the book it does mention meditation but only as scientist where trying to prove it works or not."
5,The Intention Experiment-McTaggert,Her scientific research into the power of the mind should make people re- exam their reality! Scientic information in an easy to read format with practical principles of application. Lets all get involved for the earth and humanity.
3,"Well Written, but Questionable Research","Ever since reading the holographic universe, I looked forward to reading more scientific or thoughtful analysis of 'intention' or the power of thought. Too often new age advocates talk about the 'law' of attraction and how 'quantum physics' proves their philosphies. They might sell books but they do a great disservice when people find out their claims are dubious at best. So I looked forward to reading this, unfortunately she cites some pretty flawed research.On the upside, it's one of the few books does offer some research and background to what you have to do to properly 'visualize' - and some of it is contrary to popular notion - for example, she says you need to 'power up' and get excited when visualizing goals which runs counter to prevailing notion of alpha state (which she recommends for other things)"
4,Proof That Focused Intention Has An Effect,"While many books have been written touting the benefits of positive thinking, many are anecdotal, with little in the way of 'proof' to substantiate the claims. In McTaggart's book, we are given lots of research results that clearly show that directed thinking can have a measurable impact on the world in which we live.When teamed with actions in pursuit of one's goals, focused intentions provide the best opportunity for us to attract and obtain the life we want. For those of us who believe we have to 'think' our way through life, here is verifiable justification for focusing our thoughts, our energy and our vibrations on what we do want, instead of focusing on what we don't have or on what we don't want."
4,Lotus Guide review,"The Intention Experiment: Using Your Thoughts to Change Your Life and the WorldBy Lynne McTaggartLynne McTaggart's first book, The Field: The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, documented discoveries in science that link us to a quantum field of energy, which ultimately becomes our manifested reality. Now through her new book she is providing the opportunity for people worldwide to take part in the Intention Experiment. She provides much-needed validation for the possibility of creating a new world through our thoughts. This is a great book that you can actually get involved with in a global way. See [...] Rahasya Poe, Lotus Guide, [...]"
3,Literally mind-blowing!,"I am halfway through this book. It is absolutely fascinating, but a very hard read. However, if you love(d) physics in college, you will understand more than me, that's for sure! The book is well organized, and I am very impressed with all the research. It's amazing that we don't hear much about this topic - I'm not sure our world is ready - but YOU ARE, if you are exploring topics such as this. The book is deeply intriguing but difficult for me to comprehend (otherwise I'd give the book at least 4 stars) -- so I have ordered Lynne's book, ""The Field,"" which is the precursor to this one, hoping it will help. There are obviously SO much impressive scientific experiments backing up ""intention"" that if you are interested in the power of thought and quantum physics, I'd buy the book."
1,boring,"This book is so boring I could not finish reading it. I don't think I could even watch it if it was a PBS special.The book is written for the intellectual few who belong to a specific minority of a social club designed to prevent other from entering within even if they did have the dues (money) to enter and wear the ""Club Jacket"".Yes, the Experiment does work and I knew this a long time ago. However, the ""experiment"" works in every shape form and size both positive and negative."
1,show me the money!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had listened to a ten hour unabridged audiobook of this book and have found nearly all the material irrelevant. This book does not even touch on how to make money or fill up your own bank accounts. If the reader wants a real good book on self-improvement, then I would suggest The Work We Were Born To Do by Nick Williams. I am reading through the book, using a journal and doing the exercises. I expect to see significant improvement in one year."
2,The Intention Experiment,"This book was chosen as a bookclub selection. To be honest, the subject matter is not my cup-of-tea. After a long introduction, the first 200 pages were spent detailing numerous experiments proving how ""intention"" can work--much too much information for my taste. It was very technical and for me, was a challenge to make myself read the entire book. Someone who is truly interested in this subject matter would probably see this book differently, but if the interest is only casual in nature, save your money!"
1,A bunch of psycobabble with a scientific backing.,"I was SO BUMMED when I recieved this book and started to dive in. I was looking for something to inspire me to be intentional, but this book was basically on the ""wierdo radar"". It was drawn out explanations of how our body acts as a antenna for information. Again it was very drawn out, and really just a bit far fetched. I even tried to skip a few chapters into it, to avoid the ""setup"" but, I couldn't take it."
3,A Gift,"I purchased this book after reading many reviews on it and I liked what I read. I am rating this book in the middle only because a rating is required. I had originally purchased this book for myself, however my nephew at 18 years of age came to visit and I thought the book would serve him better. He is a sweet kid, but has sort of an ""in the box"" way of thinking and looking at life and also has many fear based ideas and emotions. He has also suffered from anxiety/panic attacks over the past several years. He has been on medications in the past and has also seen therapist. From the reviews I read, I hope this book will enlighten him and open him up to the ideas of ""thinking outside the box"" and how powerful and useful ""thoughts"" can be and how they can change his life for the better. Maybe this book will also lead him to other books in this genre. Thank you to all of the reviewers who help making the purchase process more fine tuned to what a reader is really looking for."
5,Out of War,This book arrived in the time frame expected and was in excellent condition. The book had great stories and I found it very appropriate to use in my Social Studies class.
3,The Last Posse,"Did I get my money's worth? Well . . . Looking at the time period, 1912-13, I know that ""The Old West"" wasn't so ""old"" rather it was still quite on-going in fact. That the inmates had no inkling of the snowstorm when they escaped is probably the most surprising point for me. Historically, this is a topical read, with regard to the poor conditions surrounding the jails and treatment of prisoners, and how out of hand the ""Posse"" chasing the three fugitives got. Some details are still relavent today. This is a short book, and shouldn't take one long to read it."
4,Vegan: An excellent book for anyone examining their values,"Most books about vegetarianism or veganism are simply cookbooks that skirt the important issues about our choices of diet. Yet, most people would still have the question of Why? ""Vegan"" gives the answer. With up-to-date research, celebrity profiles and activist literature, it reveals the hidden truths about the Standard American Diet and provides the foundation for ethical consistency. ""Vegan"" together with ""May all be Fed"" are staples in the library of the ethically conscious."
5,Easy Read and great information,"I had already been vegan for about a month when I read this book, so I already believed in it, but this book gave all the information that could make any meat eater start to rethink what they choose to eat and any vegetarian a vegan. The first half of the book covers it from purely a health perspective and the second half covers it from an ethical perspective, so no matter who you are, some part of this book is likely to strike a cord. I have given copies of this book as gifts and have leant my copy out to many people (and if you know, me fell free to borrow it :o)"
2,Better Done Elsewhere,"This is a competent, though hardly invigorating, book about veganism. It is more of a People Magazine look at it, consisting as it does of brief chapters that are vaguely interesting but much more hero-worship of vegan ""stars"" than true insight into the issues. It is a shame, because what he says is very good. But focusing on individuals does not accomplish what he intends, and makes me feel as if I've traded the cult of meat for the cult of celebrity."
5,"response to Chris (Austin, TX)","I wanted to respond to Chris (Austin, TX). I had the same problem viewing the source notes because I downloaded the ebook from vegan.com, which for some reason left out ten pages of the book, which contain the source notes. When I purchased the print version, the notes were there, just as in the table of contents. I really did enjoy this book, because Erik Marcus' writing style is very cogent and concise, while also very narrative. The amount of sourcing is very impressive, with footnotes listed at least 2-3 times per paragraph, when a side story is not being told about some unfortunate animal rescued by his friends at the Farm Sanctuary. Overall, this book is excellent and provides a great deal of information on animal use and reasons to switch to a vegan lifestyle."
5,"Highly suggested, a wonderful book!","I read Erik Marcus's book, Vegan: The New Ethics of Eating a few months ago, and it's incredible. It's offered in a free web format from Erik's site, ... I originally read it there but have since bought the paperback. It offers so much good information, and made me incredibly happy to be vegan, and reassured me this IS the best decision I've ever made in my life. The first section of the book describes all the heath aspects of veganism, which I really wasn't that interested in previously, but made me glad I chose such a healthy lifestyle, and wanted others to do the same. It continues on through factory farming, ethics, and environmental aspects of veganism. It covers everything on why someone would choose this lifestyle. I highly suggest you all read it; you'll surely enjoy it. --Melissa Rose"
5,Wonderfully written,Erik Marcus is a great speaker and a wonderful author. It was nice to have an updated look at vegan issues. Vegan: The New Ethics of Eating is put together very well and a pleasure to read. This book makes a great present for people in your life that wonder why you are vegan or people interested in making a change to a plant-based diet. I hope this is not the only book we see from Mr. Marcus.
4,"Musical counterpart to ""The Wicker Man""","This 32 track 2-Disc collection provides a surprisingly cohesive overview of David Tibet's Current 93. Emphasizing Tibet's haunting, almost liturgical British gothic folk over his early industrial noise experiments, Black As Judas Moth includes tracks from rare and out of print releases including seven songs from All The Pretty Little Horses from 1996, 4 selections from Soft Black Stars, two cuts from Thunder Perfect Mind & the mini album, Earth Covers Earth (1990), and more. Think of the movie ""The Wicker Man"" and you'll have some idea of the general mood here. Includes guest vocalists Nick Cave & Shirley Collins featured on ""All The Pretty Little Horses."" Compiled & remastered by David Tibet. Lack of performer credits in the booklet is the only shortcoming."
2,Why didn't he just call this book Material Culturalism?,"Oh I get it, the author thought we would think he'd come up with a ""new"" anthropological theory if only he changed the name a little and then went on at great lenghts in the text to discuss differences between his new theory, and the old theory he is replacing. Yeah, that ought to do it. Right? No problemo, I'm sure no one will pick up on this."
4,Hidden Treasure,"For every known artist that is a household name there are several equally talented gems that fly under the public's radar. Scott Merritt is a good songwriter. I've seen him play these songs solo acoustic and the bear up under such a microscope. Fleshed out in the canny production of this album, his voice carries the emotionality of the songs. This album has many songs that you find yourself singing,and is very consistent across the playlist. Perhaps Canada itself produces artists like Bruce Cockburn and Scott Merritt, where their songs seemed not aimed at an external audience, but as an expression of their internal landscape."
1,A book for the scientifically illiterate...,This woman needs to retake Statistics 101.She also needs to learn how to read medical journal articles because she is blatantly misrepresenting the original articles.I am amazed to see that Americans hold an aging scientist who dabbles in a field not related to her qualifications and who has been thoroughly discredited in her home country in such high esteem. Makes me worry about the US educational system.
1,Very cheaply made!,"This item arrived with one black key already broken off! Another one came off within minutes. The electronics and sound are very good, but quality is terrible. I returned the item for a refund."
2,Poorly Constructed Toy,"I purchased this product to learn piano because I didn't want to spend much, but there are a few major problems:- Unable to play some multiple notes (i.e. chords) at the same time.- Package contains a DC adapter port, but no plug. While trying to plug in various plugs I have at home, the port on the back of the keyboard broke.Take this product for what it is... a toy. A poorly constructed toy."
3,It's okay,"This was a nice gift for my 10 yo daughter for Christmas. Although, I now realize that I could get one at the same price or less pretty much anywhere. The 2nd week we had it, one of the white keys ended up missing."
2,before it was opened @X-MAS,"this product dosent have a jack for ac adapter,2 weeks after i purchased it for amazon it went down in price by 20%. im wishing i NEVER purchased it now."
1,covers VBA only,"The book is advertised as ""100% comprehensive"", as THE Outlook bible. I don't think this is justified. There is no advice on how to write COM add-ins or automation code in C++, though this is rather common for professional applications. The author doesn't mention it at all. I can't judge if the book is a good VBA reference, but is certainly not a comprehensive approach to Outlook."
4,Worth the price,"Jan is a great guitarist with a heavy blues influence, classical chops, a unique phrasing-style in his melodic soloing, can play funky, can rock very hard...and it all shows up on this instrumental recording. Plays both acoustic and electric, plays them fast and slow, and sounds great doing it. I'd have given it five stars, but the songs aren't quite unique enough. Gets better with repeated listening."
1,Mellow & Excellent,"the general mood of the CD I would say is mellow. The guitarwork covers a wide range of styles,showing Jan's virtuosity & is very enjoyable to listen to. It is much better than Profile which had some strange rhythms. I would highly recomment The Noise of Art."
2,Why no WideScreen???,"I have seen the movie several times on the big cable providers (ie. HBO, Showtime, etc). I just can't believe that there is a movie company out there that still refuses to sell all of their movies in widescreen!! Particularly when using the DVD media! I refuse to buy any movie filmed in greater than 4x3 (ie. widescreen) on DVD or VHS until it is available in widescreen! I really liked this movie, otherwise. Alec Baldwin was subdued enough to keep my interest. And the plot, while farfetched by today's standards, fits right in with the style of the original radio drama. I give it two stars only because of the standard format."
2,Close but no cigar,"Although arguably the best film adaptation of The Shadow character to date, this production is still a misguided attempt to translate the famed radio and pulp hero to the screen. Though visually stunning, the film suffers from a poor script full of holes and bizarre leaps in logic, and direction which shifts awkwardly between camp and a serious period adventure piece. There is no personal connection between the characters and the audience and consequently we don't care about any of them. The one character who should serve as our ""eyes and ears"" on screen, Margo Lane, is provided with mental telepathy, which sets her apart from the audience. Overall, as a fan of the radio and pulp incarnations of The Shadow, I was disappointed with the film."
2,"Terrific, underrated movie ... but full screen? Please.","The title says it all. The movie itself gets 4 to 5 stars; the studio gets minus two or three for issuing a widescreen movie in fullscreen format. At least give viewers an option to see the whole film. Save your money until that comes out, or satisfy yourself with 66% of pretty good."
5,Shadow,"As a child I listened to The Shadow on radio, then watched him on TV. Although the film was not a commrcial success, I thoroughly enjoyed it and was glad to see they kept the character true to the original."
3,Feast Your Eyes,"Oscars are apparently only given to art directors of successful movies, so this one lost out. Never mind. The production's gorgeous. The costume designer also has a field day, not only with Mongol warriors, and Lamont Cranston's dinner clothes but swathing Penelope Ann Miller in velvets and satins. This skillful comic actress has never looked so luscious. The movie doesn't succeed ultimately because too much of the action's meaningless and badly paced. It's best when it captures the thirties' breathless fascination with hypnotism and the far east...even when we get such howlers as ""The Opium Fields of Tibet"". I enjoyed it in spite of itself."
2,Teenville,"This strongly resembles the Superman films: it was designed for teenage audiences, with lots of violence and noise, and it is utterly brainless. The most interesting question is: Can Alec Baldwin act? Vacuous and silly, the movie no doubt made a lot of money. And I'm out $6 for believing the reviewers on Amazon.com."
4,Under rated super hero movie,"I saw this movie on TV just a bit ago and liked it. Its one of those films that I find under rated. The setting in 1930s makes it real enjoyable. For the most part, this is the film that you'll either like or enjoy. If you liked the Avengers (1997) and Mission Impossible (1996), you should love this film.I'm not saying it's great or fantastic but it definitely is good."
4,"Fun superhero film, good period peice","The Shadow is one of the oldest superheroes, predating even Batman. This film wisely keeps to his roots.Set in New York in the 1930s Alec Baldwin's Shadow fights a crazed descendant of Ghengis Khan. The sets and costumes are first rate, the performances are campy but fun.It's a good light superhero film with thrills and laughs. It makes you wish for more."
4,Not bad.,I remeber watching this show when i was about 14 and though it was fantastic. It's still a pretty good show and a decent watch. Interesting to see Ian Mckellan in this type of small role. Although it wasn't as goood as I rembered it being it was still a pretty good watch. I don't regret my purchase at all.
3,a classic mystery,This is more a mystery with a little bit of pstchic abilities thrown in. the shadow is the darkness that is present in everyman's heart. baldwin's character who used to be really evil before he was refomed by the monk uses his psychic abilities to help the unfortunate victims of evil men. it actually is a really simple story of an evil man reformed through the teachings of a monk and is now using his psychic abiliies to help the less fortunate of his world then later on confronted by another of the monks student that unfortunately the monk couldnt reform. it was hinted that he killed the monk and now he's here to kill baldwin's character if he doesnt join him in his quest to rule the world. the final confrontation is to show that the good always win over evil and that baldwin is the better psychic here because he was fully able to control the evil that lurks in his heart and use it for the good of all. and he was also able to avenge his master's death.
4,Fun stuff,"I love the mystical Chinese aspect to this film. Some slight corniness, I suppose, in some places, but hey...a lotta movies have that. Just fun to watch. John Lone does a fine job. Lots of memorable quotes. GREAT music. All-star cast. One of my favorite movies of its kind."
4,Great fun.,"I still think that The Shadow was one of the most stylish and fun super-hero films. There seems to be great sense of fun between the actors, the film has fun without compromising the conflict. It was nice to see Jonathan Winters in a role full of droll humor."
4,Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of Men?,"A nice homage to OTR's greatest hero, The Shadow.I felt the story could have been developed more, and Penelope Ann Miller made a poor Margot Lane. And the scenes between Lamont Cranston and Shiwan Khan discussing clothes was ridiculous.Overall, a good effort."
5,Shadow movie,This was gift for a family member and they loved it. It is a very entertaining movie. Thank you so very much.
2,As bad as I remembered!,"Good things about this film: The deco sets are beautiful! The cast is stelar! And the idea is basically OK.But sadly, with all this talent, the writers and director put together a script, and insult to injury, direction, that reduced all of these fine talents to cardboard cutouts. Yes, the cast was strangled with piano wire! The only exception is Tim Curry; He is his irrepresable self in this film. Tim Curry doing Tim Curry, and doing Tim Curry to the hilt! Nuf said.The absolutely bigest insult in this film comes in the last few minutes, when Jonathan Winters has the line, ""What he hell is that?"" They didn't even show him giveing the line! In what could have been a 'grity/camp' movie, with plenty of opportunities to showcase the casts talents, viewers are given cold grits.And if your going to hang an 'A' bomb from the cealing, don't let it swing around like its held up by fishing line!"
3,Badly disappointed.,I like this film. I like it enough to own it. I like it enough to keep it. I leave it to other reviewers to discuss its merits (and a couple of its flaws - it's not perfect). All I will say is that it is inexscusable that we can only get it pan and scanned and not letterboxed. A shame...
5,THE SHADOW!,The Shadow is great moovi Y'all shou see it. One of my favorits The Shadow Rules. I only saw her on vhs but great moovi I give 5/5 in Y'all Ratin It accion packed and Peppy Ann Millar is pertty. My daddy says hubba hubba. Buy this moovi it wondefool.
3,"""Shady deals ...........""","OK, so the production values are just period perfect! Could not ask for better casting - Alec Baldwin is dashing [a youthful Ray Milland perhaps?] as Lamont Cranston! Penelope Ann Miller brings a great sense of period, style, and comedy to her Margo lane, Ian McKellen - aptly befuddled as the father/scientist, and not forgetting, underrated JOHN LONE as our arch villian. So, what's wrong with this picture - yeah, it's the picture folks, here we have a product, superbly presented, with all the necessary [nothing lacking] bells and whistles, and this version is CROPPED! Where, Oh Where is the all important widescreen version? It's been shown on TV in that format, what went wrong? It's still well-worth having on DVD, but get with it folks!"
3,Sunday afternoon fun,"Ok, just to be upfront this film isn't what I would call a ""full price"" movie. But, if you find it on sale or in a bargin blowout sale, it is worth buying. It is silly, but fun. This is not the disaster the ""Phantom"" (Billy Zane) was. Let go and just watch. Don't look for edgy writing or serious special effects, just have fun. And any movie with Johnaton Winters can't be all that bad."
2,"""The Shadow""","A film of grandiose design with a camera that can't capture it. From beginning to end, we're constantly (and painfully) aware of the great film it might have been had it been directed with more patience and a better sense of rhythm. As it is, the film simply has no drive, no forward charge to it; it's as if it's standing still throughout the entire running time. Alec Baldwin, in the title role, is as bland as he's ever been, though it's not as if the script gives him anything real to work with. There's nothing plot-like here, and things are not helped by groan-inducing attempts at humor. It's not an utter loss: the production design is marvelous, and the scene where Tim Curry confronts the Shadow in an abandoned hotel has a genuine intensity that you'll wish had been present throughout the film entire. Also featuring Penelope Ann Miller, Ian McKellen (who's largely wasted), Jonathan Winters, and Peter Boyle."
4,"Very Good movie, Questionable DVD","I saw the movie in the theater and enjoyed it very much! The ending was a bit abrupt but the ride was great. Baldwin played the part just right and the whole world of The Shadow was very well done. The only problem I have with the DVD is that, to my knowledge, it has never been released in wide screen format. How Universal could release such a good movie in pan-and-scan only is a mystery. Even the DTS version isn't in wide screen! Aside from that, I think this movie would be a pleasent suprise to sci-fi fans."
2,It's FULL SCREEN.,"Let's say the movie deserves 4 stars at least. It's beautiful and the plot stays true to the original characters. Whatever you may think of Alec Baldwin's acting ability it's still a good movie. But the DVD is an old style, barebones, FULL SCREEN version. It's crap. The only reason you should buy this is that you can't wait to see it one more time and it's cheap...otherwise get the even cheaper serials like the Invisible Avenger and wait for the Special Edition."
1,DVD is Pan&Scan... what a waste!,"If you are a fan of old radio drama's and art deco styling, then you will love this film. Great music and visuals, and a decent story. The problem lies in the DVD print. Here again was a chance to utilize the DVD format to its utmost, but it failed from the start. I have seen more and more titles being released on DVD only to be a poor Pan&Scan transfer. It must just be the studio's trying to cash in on the new technology without having to do some actual work on producing a good product. This seems to be the same video transfer as the VHS version. So if you want to see this title in its best picture quality and in Widescreen format, you have to go with the Laserdisk issue, which is quite good."
2,Good movie hampered by limited DVD conversion,"I really liked the movie, even when it got too thin in the script department. The production was slick and maintained my interest during the whole movie. It is relatively short, and would be good at a party. Just don't expect the script quality of a Tim Burton's Batman movie.The downside is that the DVD conversion was not that good. For example, I noticed that the French version had better visual quality than the English version, like during the intro, when the title ""The Shadow"" appears. I think this DVD is a direct-from-VHS copy. Not the best of all methods!The features are quite limited. It is not even widescreen. No extra footage...Frankly, you are better of buying the VHS version of this movie."
4,How Did This One Slip Through the Cracks?,"While so much of what they pass off today as fantasy is nothing more than CGI swill ""The Shadow"" is a breath of fresh air. It has fantastic production design and jawdropping effects that actually serve the story. It contains intelligent characters and dialogue. Alec Baldwin and Penelope Ann Miller are throwbacks to the era the film portrays with Baldwin dapper as Lamont Cranston and Miller absolutely glamorous as Margo Lane. The underutilized John Lone makes for a compelling adversary to the Shadow. Do yourself a favor and discover this unheralded gem."
4,A fun thriller to watch in the shadows.,"i finely got my copy of the shadow & well i have to say where is the extras? i wish it would've been widescreen i mean how hard could it be. the dts sound is great but it could a little more juice in the mix . besides that it's a good decent transfer of the film not bad , the cast does a wonderful job if you're into comic books, old drama radio broadcasts of the 40's & 30's, 50's then this for you. i love this film the sets & special effects are excellent.Highly recommended For 13 & over .this film rating is because, it being extemely violent in couple of scenes this not for little children."
4,Great film. Poor Package.,"If this film was in a Keep case (which now, after 3 years of release, it is), and it was WIDESCREEN, it would be a quick buyfor me. As it is, I have to hold on to my aging VHS copy. I really wanted this for my DVD collection, but this film, like TIMECOP have been poorly packaged, and put out. Who wants FULLScreen on DVD?Alec Baldwin and the rest of the cast do a GREAT job in this fun, campy, tounge-and-cheek film, based on an old comic book. I love this film. If you like films like: Tremmors, the Phantom, Men in Black, Charlie's Angeles, then you like this as well.But I wish it was Widescreen. It lost a star for that."
2,"Great Audio, Poor Video","This is a review more about the DVD transfer than the content.The DTS audio is much better than the DD version. Cleaner and more dynamic sound (which is important for this movie). The video on the other hand, is full screen not anamorphic wide screen. The artifacts are very visible due to the dark screen and fast actions. It is really too bad Universal had done a great job makeing the DTS version available only to be let down by the poor video. I can not recommend it but if you can live with the poor full frame video, get the DTS version. It worth the extra money."
2,"Great movie, but Fullscreen only?","WTF? How could you take a cool movie like the Shadow, with all the flair and style that Baldwin brings to it, along with John Lone, and make it pan-and-scan?!?! GOD but I hate fullscreen. This movie gets five stars, but the damn publishers get zero. Anyone in their right mind these days buys widescreen, only old people or those who don't go to movie theatres... EVER, buy crappy Fullscreen crap. YYAAARGGGHH!"
3,For the Widescreen fans.,While I am a widescreen lover. It should be noted that The Shadow was originally filmed in FULL FRAME. The intended Aspect ratio for theater was 1:85.1 the full image was matted for theaterical release. So your not really losing any image like you normally would. This was also done with the Batman films.While widescreen will always rule wether you lose picture or not ( Due to the fact that theaterical/Directors presentation is what matters more) it's important to let people know who would like to own this film on DVD that the issue is not that bad.1. It's Full Frame not Pan Scaned ( Your not missing any image)If you must have the widescreen image make your own 1:85.1 mats.2. It probably won't be re-released by Universal any time soon.Poor Box office and Vhs/Dvd sales are to blame. Although it would be nice to see an Universal ULTIMIT EDITION 2 disc set featuring box Matted and Full Frame versions with extras.3. This edition is almost out of print.
2,Wait for the letterbox version,"A great ""B"" grade film which I already own on VHS. I will not buy the DVD, or recommend anyone else buy it, until it is re-released in letterbox format (which is why I give this version 2 stars)."
4,A really fun movie,"My husband requested this movie & Amazon was the only place we could find it. It's an old movie but the special effects are still good. The storyline starts out a little silly but quickly gets interesting. Being based on a comic book obviously it has that kind of feel, but it still is just a really fun movie with some great humor & a feel good ending."
4,Lots of surprises,"This movie has fast paced action,good acting with a touch of the exotic. Based on an radio series. I liked it!"
1,Horrible,"The Shadow is a terrible movie. There's no other way to put it. It's ineptly directed, horrible acted, features cheesy special effects, and has some truly lame action sequences. Definitely a must miss."
1,They Think He's A Genius In France,"Alec, you said it and the money has been offer. Leave this country now and take your rotten movies with you. You never know, they may appreciate you in France."
4,A Great Gift..,"My father in law loves this movie, so it was the perfect father s day present and we had a nice time as a family..."
3,In The Shadow,A marvellous escape into the yesterdays of my childhood. A reminder of a simpler less complicated time when good versus evil was a clear-cut battle with good triumphing in this eternal battle. Yes I enjoyed the film and the acting was great and the cinemaphotography was vivid and eye-catching. The setting almost surrealistic. Overall a fascinating experience.
5,Best Superhero Movie Ever!!!!,"""The Shadow"" is the best, most faithful adaptation of superhero-to-film ever made. Even the original ""Batman,"" a great film, got some stuff wrong. But ""The Shadow"" scores on every level, from the effects to the set design, from the characters to Jerry Goldsmith's wonderful orchestral score. If only the DVD was in widescreen with some supplemental material, i.e.: trailer, production notes (there are none, despite them being mentioned up above), and perhaps an audio commentary by the director. But all-in-all, a great must-own movie for fans of The Shadow, old-fashioned matinee serials, and good movies in general. Sit back and enjoy!"
4,Lacy,"This book was great. For being an avid a Mystery/Suspense reader who does not like Romance novels, I could not put this book down. There are family tragedies, love lost and found and best of all hot romance scenes. The romance scenes were sensual and exciting and the comedy in the book was just enough to give it that extra edge.If your like me a person who thinks that romance novels are tiresome, you will be pleasantly surprised. This is an all around great book."
4,Diana Palmer Newbie,"I just started reading books by Diana Palmer and got immediatly sucked in! She has a wonderful talent for writing passionate and heartfelt story lines. Lacy was no exception! Kept me rivited until the end! I lovedc that it was one of her longer stories because I hate it when her books end! I think Ms. Palmer has spoiled me for other romance authors! Would love to find another author who is as passionate and could rivit me as she does. I thoroughly enjoy her books (I have read several by now and LOVED ""Evan!""), but they do follow similar storylines. Any suggestions?!"
2,skimmed through it,"I started reading this book, but when I realized there were so many character lines it just got boring. Even though the book is titled Lacy she is just one of several female leads and I dont like that. I bought this book because I have read Noelle by Palmer and enjoyed that because of the focus on the male and female leads, it was also a simple story line. Skip Lacy."
5,excellent resource for archaeology student,"The multidisciplinary study of archaeology requires a broad database of knowledge, and the Oxford Companion offers itself as an excellent resource. Alphabetical entries are provided in subject areas, and especially helpful is a variety of timelines and graphical data as well as a comprehensive index. Fagan's compilation of entries from renowned social scientists in the Oxford Companion is an essential in my personal library, and is referred to consistently."
4,"Review from ""Choice Magazine"", June 1996","""Metter's guide contains a wealth of information not only for writers but for anyone doing research. Biased toward resources found in libraries, the volume covers both general and specific subject materials in printed and electronic format. Part 1 covers basic library collection organization and online searching strategies. Part 2 surveys access for journals, magazines, and newspapers. Part 3 through 5 are devoted to specific subject resources -- biographical, statistical, geographical, legal, etc. Each entry is annotated, and online services are noted where applicable. Included are two appendices, the first a guide to periodical indexes, the second to online and database services. This wonderful accumulation of research materials makes the volume a valuable reference tool for librarians. Highly recommended for writers and librarians."" J.P. Burton, West Chester University of Pennsylvania"
5,Love and laughter on a deserted island.,"MIX: 1. escaped convict (GQ material), 2. a lawyer (a gorgeous blond with legs that go on forever) and 3. three orphans (a 2,5 and 11 year old) on a deserted island. RESULT: Sexual innuendos combined with hilarity frothing with romance and bursting with laughter. When the antics of all the characters don't have you laughing until your sides hurt, then your imagination is running wild with all the romantic opportunities. And if that isn't enough add a goat, a genie and some tropical nights."
4,I Can See Why This Book Got Both Good And Bad Reviews,"Without giving too much away I do see how people were disappointed in this book because at times I was. It was a great story with wonderful characters. I was lost in it until Chapter 9 when out of no where comes a twist that knocked me for a loop and changed everything. All I can say is if you looking for reality and can't use your imagination than don't read this one it will not work for you. I was so bumbed then I decided to play along and finish it and was glad I did. Do I still wish things would have turned out differently yes, will I lose sleep over it no, would I have invested any money in reading this book yes but no more than $3, am I glad I got it for free yes. I believe that Theodore wished for a rescue but I still wish I knew what the exact wording of the wish was I think it would have made for a better ending for me personally. Happy Reading Enjoy."
1,Not Great,"The story line sounded interesting enough. However, characters were very shallow, much of it was serious, then they add a genie. It was like reading a few different stories at once, but no depth to any of the characters. So much more could have been done with this, and the genie could have waited for a different book. I'm really having trouble finishing this one."
4,Delightful!,"This was the first of many Jill Barnett books that I will be reading. It was a light romp, an easy read and done in a couple of hours. The characters were an interesting blend of the...unordinary. Even the children were likable! I look forward to more of the same from Ms. Barnett."
2,Strange,"Started off okay, however, it soon turned very strange. Set in the late 1800's, but too many items and phrases mentioned throughout are more modern-day. The 'genie' was just over the top for what could've been a decent historical romance, and I skimmed to the end after he poofed his way into the story. It's sort of harlequin meets aladdin. Not my style, but other's apparently enjoy it."
2,Disappointed,"Ok I read this authors Bridge to Happiness, and was wowed by that book. So I searched for another, and saw this was so highly reviewed, I thought to try it. Now there is no comparison between the two books, I won't go there. But this book was very disappointing to me, and I know it's an older, dated offering. It just was off the wall, and the lead characters were beyond annoying. I couldn't stand Margaret enough to care, and was vaguely disturbed that a highly educated woman, with money, was so extremely clueless and we were supposed to accept that. I suppose I just do not have the right Imagination to stick with this book, I deleted it before the halfway mark. I wish I had picked something else to try from this author instead!"
2,Not worth the 4 stars it currently rates ...,"I decided to give it a try since it was free. Good thing, 'cause it wasn't worth it otherwise. Maybe I'm not into the fantasy part of it enough, but there's just too much I can't stretch my brain around. I could have enjoyed the story as much, and potentially even more, without the genie. That was just too over the top. Combining the young children, their trauma over losing their parents in such a horrific manner, and the sexual innuendos was a little too much at once. This could have been a touching tale, and could have been almost fun to read if it hadn't been so over the top with the fantasy stuff. The (human) characters were well established and I really enjoyed each of them for their own strengths - and weaknesses. Anyway, if you're into fantasy and just unbelievable mish-mash, you'd probably enjoy this. If you're looking for a story to remember, don't bother."
3,"Very Good, but Jill Barnett has written better","Compare this book to Carried Away, MY personal favorite of Jill's. (You might even make the connection between the bottle the two terrors were fighting over briefly in Carried Away with a bottle in this book). While not one of her best, I still enjoyed it better than a Johanna Lindsey or an Amanda Quick, and I would probably die if someone asked me to choose between Catherine Coulter, Julie Garwood, and Jill Barnett for my favorite author. What I'm trying to say, is that if this is your first time reading Jill -- don't let it be your last."
2,Too Much for Me,"I struggled with this book because while the author writes a good story, there's a lot to overlook in the category of believable. I downloaded the book without looking too far into the reviews and finally gave up when the genie in a bottle appeared. I was caught so off guard by his appearance that I read the first couple of sentences of that chapter three or four times before continuing on, certain I'd really missed something previously in the story. So if you want something that could happen in today's world (or even the late 1800s when the story takes place), then you'll want to skip this one.I also wouldn't recommend this book to those looking for a clean romance. Let me just say that the main male of the story is an escaped convict with a very difficult past. While his thoughts, words and actions are within character, they are not for those who prefer carefully guarding what they read."
2,Loved it--until a freakin' genie showed up!,"Got this on my Kindle because it was free, and was thoroughly enchanted by the first several chapters--until a genie shows up! A genie, really?? Why??? The book was just fine without it. So I wound up skipping all the genie parts (and believe me, it really didn't change the story, so that shows how ""critical"" the genie was--NOT!).Then the book went totally off the rails. You see, the hero started out a bit like Clark Gable in ""It Happened One Night"" (rough, crude, street-smart, more than a little obnoxious, and VERY dismissive of a woman's abilities)--but he pretty much stayed that way. By the time the heroine ""fell in love with him,"" I was fairly convinced she had Stockholm syndrome. Yes, he finally changed, but only AFTER the heroine had professed an undying love for him. Glad it was free, and I'll check out more Jill Barnett books, but the genie and the obnoxious hero totally ruined it for me."
2,Skip this one - there a better out there.,"Overall quality was great but the mounting options are a joke. Comes with two strips of double sided tape that are basically useless on the steering column plastic. Also, there are no holes to connect the OEM leather steering column cover under the instrument cluster to this unit."
5,~Nice~,This is a very nice and interesting book. It tells us almost everything about the hidden powers of the animals
5,Ghandi and King,"This book was an excellent textbook and read. It gives a detailed overview of both leaders, their philosophies and their accomplishments. I kept it after the class was over, because I wanted to read it again and have it for my children to either use for school or read themselves. This may sound silly...but I think I became a better person after reading this book. Perhaps, because I became more familiar with a different culture and/or time period through Nojeim's eyes and well written text."
4,lomax folk music,"a little different than my original hardcover - but serves the purpose to compare to Childe ballads. opps pnly 16 words. am an editor, short is good."
3,Scholarly but to me esoteric,"I bought this book hoping to learn the words and music for some of the songs that Pete Seegar has recorded. There were only 17 songs the same as the recordings I have and 36 not (including Barbara Allen, Camptown Races, Water is Wide, and so on) I only knew 21 of the songs--I don't know what criteria the Lomax brothers used, but now I will have to buy another book that has more popular and well known ballads and folk songs. An excellent book if you are a scholar of ballads and folk songs, but practically useless for me."
1,Disappointing,"This book is one of the biggest disappointments in my long life of 65 years. I haven't heard a dozen of the songs included in the book and some of those that I had heard I never liked in the first place. If you're looking for a fake book, keep looking; this book doesn't include chords. The book does include ""Rye Whiskey"", ""Little Brown Jug"", and ""Good Ole Mountain Dew"" and drinking and drinking songs were my only consolation in buying the book. A hearty thumbs down and one quarter of a star to ""American Ballads and Folk Songs."""
4,It could sound better,"Although it's live, it doesn't sound as good as it could. All of the songs sound kind of tinny, if you know what I mean. I know that in real life they don't sound like that because my dad went to see them on that tour and he recorded some of it and that tape doesn't sound tinny. I also went to see them myself in February and they sounded great, even though Difford wasn't there. (He was in the hospital. Tillbrook said something about a 12-step program.)"
4,Successful use of techniques,"I read many of the reviews of this book before I made my purchase. In reading this and many other ADHD books, I agree that for a successful life, one must learn to control one's behavior or be eaten alive by society in one way, shape or form.The strict disciplinary tact outlined by this book has helped tremendously in curbing my 6 year old's impulsive behaviors. The understanding of the use of affirmative and positive reinforcement as well as ""boredom"" as a consequence has truly helped our son as well as our parental sanity. This book may not be for everybody - but it is a Godsend for our family."
4,"Not for the 10% who need meds, but...","In this book, it is clearly stated that some kids need meds. This book is for the other 90% of us. I worked with my child for 18 months breaking some really bad habigs, seemingly exhausting all approaches from pleading, bribing, lecturing, explaining, and screaming. This approach stopped the habit in 3 days. Parents need to remember that we are not punching bags for our children, and sometimes kindness can be enabling. I dismiss the notion that we cannot instill consequences for behavior. I am not an advocate of belittling or spanking a child, but I am a HUGE advocate of making one accountable for one's actions via a ""reflection or thoughtful spot"" (time-out). And he states multiple times throughout the book to encourage, encourage, encourage the child when the appropriate behavior is used."
2,This book isn't the answer either.,"While this book gives some good ideas on dealing with almost any child, anyone with a ADHD child knows that these teqniques do not FIX,ALTER,or make it any easier to deal with the problem in real life. This book didn't tell me anything I didn't already know, made some wild accusations about Ritalin and basically left me in the same boat I have been rowing for 7 years.Do your homework parents. Get a good clinical psychologist and keep READING!!!"
4,great parenting advice,I like Dr. Stein's philosophy of giving kids responsibility and giving them chances to think about and process their own behaviors. His approach is full of love and wisdom and is helpful even if your children are not on medication.
4,i think this book would be helpful,"i thought this was a good book. i am surprised by the negativity in some of the reivews. it has solid information for helping parents discipline and lead their child. don't read this book unless you are ready to take the plunge and really change some things in your life and your child's. it requires the parents to increase their self-discipline too, by being consistent."
5,Finally....the truth!,"Finally someone brave enough to stand up and say..there IS no such thing as ADD/ADHD. These are convenient labels for parents who are not prepared to give the time and attention required to their children,its just an excuse for poor parenting skills.Here....here Mr. Stein........he makes good common sense!"
1,Didn't work,"No music, I had to return it. It was very cute, but something was defective in the one we got."
3,"Not Worth It, Toy too hyper-active","Cute and fun, but music keeps playing forever and my baby kicks so fast I can't see her noticing the change in tune in order to learn that her kicking is causing the music. Bottom line, I really wouldn't buy again."
2,Not what I expected,"I have one word for this book, insipid. If you're a fan of Iris Johansen as I am you will be big time disappointed in this book. It's trite and the dialog simply DOES NOT WORK. Mostly, Lily, the main character was so foolish. The things Andrew told her seemed so farfetched yet she simply believed them.The science fiction or paranormal aspect to the book was interesting. It's just the words these two main characters bat back and forth...it just doesn't play. I don't know under what catagory the author originally marketed this book, maybe that would explain why the book seemed so empty to me.However, if you enjoy some steamy romance, there is a bit of that here. It seemed to me, a book where she was trying it all out to see what works in a book and what doesn't.Borrow this from your library but don't buy it...."
2,A true folly!,"At first, I did't know this book was the third of a series of four(Last Bridge Home- Star Light Star Bright- Magnificent Folly- A Tough Man to tame). Therefor, the secret that shared Andrew and Lily was so devastating I couldn't stop laughing.Magnificent Folly was a really true folly for me."
2,Creamy but not so good fragrance.,"I was really hoping for a lovely honey fragrance product but,alas, it did not happen. This lotion was semi-pricey and did not deliver. Too bad because I was really looking forward to it...."
4,"Death waxed over, A Pour way to dye and A flicker of doubt",These three books are murder mysteries and a nice easy read. I was pleased with my purchase and the service I received.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Headphones with the back of the neck band are good for activities like bike riding. But not these. I've had cheapo headphones from Coby that were good enough, but these are awful. Whatever claims they make about frequency response are simply invented. No bass or anything close at all. The sound is simply not worth listening to. Listening to traffic and birds or whatever is preferable to subjecting your ears to the sound from these things. Don't waste your money on anything from Jwin."
3,Socks review,I purchased nine pair of these socks. I have worn each pair once. I think quality control could have been better. So far three different socks already have holes in them. I now have seven and one half pairs left. Those 15 remaining socks seem fine and are very comfortable
1,"Not gray, don't stay up, didn't even ship for a week.","I ordered a neutral color, gray, but these are more of a rosy tan (probably taupe, actually). The band across the top has no elastic (none, zero), so they fall to your ankles by the time you've walked into another room. The other thing is they didn't even get around to shipping for a week, so the person bringing them to Guatemala for me almost didn't receive them on time. And because I live out of the country, returning them isn't an option. =\"
5,Great Sock,These socks are terrific. They are long so that they cover up to my calf. Don't fall down. And the plus size is just terrific. No binding or pinching.
2,Not great,"I bought these socks to wear with boots, but they do not stay up well and bunch at the ankles after a few hours."
3,OLD VHS 1980s feel,"I've only skimmed this DVD from the library. The menu system is great, it's divided by ALL the MANY different things they teach. Most of it is the basic stuff, nothing demolition or construction that you'd want a contractor for. The con is you can easily tell it's an old VHS from the late 80s - early 90s? & though there's no date.. at one point, an electrician says, ""If your wall switch doesn't work, you can trade if for many other styles..."" He shows all the old ones & then says, ""here's a brand new special one called a ROCKER switch...""Here's the scary thing, he shows you how to take out the old wall light switch & replace it, but never mentions *just in case for the forgetful or total newbie* to turn OFF the POWER to that switch so you don't literally kill yourself. Now I know that's common sense & no one likes to be reminded of something so obvious, but since this geared specifically for the people new at this, shouldn't they have to?"
2,Way outdated,"Upon reviewing this product one would think that the videos would be relativly new. However, they are videos of a home improvement show that aired in the mid 80's and didn't provide any insight to new techniques and current tools."
3,Constant Power,"The adapter fits my phone and charges it at a common speed. However, when my phone is plugged in to the charger, the backlight will not turn off. Even when I turn off my phone, there is a constant backlight on. This didn't happen with the manufactor's charger. It still does the job though."
5,Troy Ramey takes us way back,"I am a 34 year old African American woman and this album is one of those albums that take you back to that old time gospel music, that old, grandma cooking collard geens and the cornbread in the old black skillet in the lil' ol wooden house before she walked to the lil' old wooden church down the old dirt road gospel music! Troy Ramey is one of the many gospel pioneers, I love and appricieate old gospel because those are the songs that our grandmothers and my great great grandmothers and grandfathers sang to make it thru difficult times. Back when all they had was the Lord and that's all they knew and they made it! They paved the way for today's African American generation!"
2,DISSAPOINTED!!,"Had 2 pieces missing and was difficult to assemble in the age range suggested. Overall a good toy, just wish all pieces were there."
3,ok toy,The joints are way too tight. It is made in America and sturdy. My four year old is having trouble getting the pieces to fit together. I do too.
4,Better than Lincoln Logs,"These are better than Lincoln Logs. The square shape of the Roy Toys are easier to build on than the circular Lincoln Logs. The littlest Lincoln Log pieces were easy to topple over, but the Roy Toy version locks in better with a tighter fit. This fort set is great. Though my 6 year old son didn't find this to be the most exciting toy on Christmas morning, I find him incorporating it into much of his play. Whether he is playing with plastic army men, G.I.Joe, Star Wars or whatever his big imagination is having an opportunity to explore more. This says alot when you look at which toys from Christmas he plays with the most."
1,Beware of buying this book,"I have read this book in the hope of learning more about .NET security. Instead, all I got was a whole lot of incomprehensible jargon with long sentences, which does not increase my understanding at all. In fact, some of the code examples are lifted from the MSDN website! The cryptography section is the worst. I cannot understand what the chapter is trying to say after reading it for a few times.There are better books than this. For example, .NET Security and Cryptography by Peter Thorsteinson. Check that out."
5,I had this leaflet before but was missing pages. The only thing I didn't like was the cost.,I had this leaflet from when it first became available but over the years I lost a couple pages from it. The only problem I had with my purchase was the cost. This leaflet was less than 3.00 but I paid over 5.00.
3,music lover,"I love this it sounds like a crazy concauktion of the smiths, new order and the sundays. The three go together masterfully love it."
2,Happy 80's Mope to You Too,"I had this CD on my list to explore for some reason, probably because I heard its one real keeper, Homeless Club Kids, streamed somewhere. Think of Van Gogh's painting Starry Night. Then think of some enraptured enthusiast painting a copy of Starry Night for sale to the sidewalk crowd outside the MoMA here in New York. That's what My Favorite is to the Smiths, The Cure, etc, a pretty bleak alternative. The music is listenable and -- as the techo bonus disc also proves -- club danceable, the lyrics are mannered, depressing and banal all at once. On a few cuts the female singer Andrea Vaughn makes more of them than they deserve. Recommended downloads: The Happiest Days of My Life, Homeless Club Kids, Burning Hearts and the Black Cassette. As for the rest, forget it."
2,"Great Idea, Ok Execution, Poor Quality Control","Found this toy 2 months ago at a Science Museum, bought it for the birthday of a child. Today, we open the present and find that it has 2 missing pieces and extra of another piece and they are tiny. The purple peg board is too light, making it more challenging for toddlers. The peg board fits in half the size of the packing box, its approximate dimensions are width 8.25"" x 2"" depth X height 4""Since this set is missing pieces, the children can't use the toy as intended and complete many of the puzzle cards and other sorting challenges.The layout and graphic design of the instructions is poor, but so are most toy instructions leaflets for children. The cards could have used a better design as well, but the sort challenge is clearly illustrated."
4,Great album,"I used to have this CD back in the early '90s. On the back it said 'mixed all wrong in doubly'.I am thankful that Amazon had it available for download. Josephine the singer is one of my favs.Have fun,DWN2DV8"
3,"Solid pop, but...","...still a little disappointing given the talents involved. Deborah Holland has a voice you will either enjoy or it will grate on your nerves very quickly. She writes some interesting material, however, which makes these songs a cut above your typical pop fare. Still, it feels as if Copeland and Clarke are holding back considerably, especially when compared to more interesting stuff they do musically on ""Animal Logic II"" which I consider definitely the superior album."
4,"It's mind-boggling how many people don't ""get"" this film ...","I understand that we all have different opinions, and that's actually a good thing. If we all liked the same things, the world would be a very dull place indeed. But several people who have given this film a one-star review don't seem to understand that it's a spoof. It's SUPPOSED to be comical. The gay jokes are not offensive whatsoever (they're done in a satirical fashion), as well as the anti-religious content and the racial jokes. This is a SATIRE, folks. ""South Park"" and ""Family Guy"" are edgier and more ""offensive"" than this. It's supposed to be a horror comedy. That's why the demons look and move the way they do and that's why the characters are caricatures of your typical ""old dark house horror film"" kids. Anyone with half a brain SHOULD be able to see that. Jeez!"
2,"Cheesy,but the Bad Cheese Overall!","What can I say about The Convent, well while there is some fun scenes and elements at times exspecially the cool ""Kill Bill"" style action scene in the beginning of the film, cool effects at times, and Adrienne Barbeau in the film. The movie is bad overall. It's cheesy,but the bad cheese. The film starts out good maybe 30 minutes into the film,but goes down slowly.The acting is overall bad, the casting for some parts is stupid, and even though I love cheesy scenes. Some of these cheesy scenes weren't good.Now, I can't complain because a friend gave this movie to me for free after he thought it was terrible and so I knew what I was getting into. If you want to watch it then I recommend renting it first.Overall, I am giving it 2 stars for some good scenes and elements plus the awesome,Adrienne Barbeau!"
4,"Great, Awesomely Bad Flick","This movie has the perfect balance of horror movie cliches and being able to laugh at itself. The characters are bad caricatures and stereotypes--the goth pretentious throng, the jock and cheerleader, the stoner, etc--and the plot is laughable. The Convent is great in that it's so terrible, and it is a great film for watching in a group setting, such as at parties."
1,The Convent Will Leave You Praying . . . NO SEQUAL!,"Whatever drives you away from ""The Convent"" -- the low-end ""special effects,"" the horrible acting, or more troubling factors (the homophobic gay subplot), avoid this horrific piece of schlock at all costs.Certainly underdeveloped plots and characters are not unique in B-grade movies. In fact, there's something endearing about it that turns these films into the ""cult favorites"" mentioned in another review on this site.However, hesitate to even consider this film ""B-Grade."" Are there ""C"" and ""D-Class"" horror films? Apparently so. The characters in ""The Convent"" are such stereotype, so one-dimensional, they disappear if they turn sideways. The ghoul-affects of ""vibrating"" looks like a shaky-handed cameraman is at work.Poor Adrienne Barbeau. And Coolio . . . This is no ""Gangsta's Paradise."" By the final ""plot twist"", you'll find yourself praying that these actors never fall to this level again . . . and praying for absolutely NO SEQUAL!"
2,not that great,"This movie could have been great but its not. the opening is a stunner but it goes downhill from there. and although the flashback scenes are pretty darn creepy with the nuns, its over far too quick. you wonder what adrienne barbeau was thinking being in this?! It could've and should've been alot better."
4,Absolutely Hysterical,"If you are looking for an intelligent,scary horror film...this is not it. But if you are looking for outrageous camera work, laugh out loud lines and undead nuns, guns, and gasoline...this is flawless. It really shows that the director, writer, and actors had a blast making this and play it totally for laughs. I was on the floor cracking up through most of it and can highly recommend it for those friday night parties when you're with all your friends, had a few drinks , and don't really want to use your brains..."
3,Creative effect; uncreative movie.,"Now you have to give this movie some credit. There's nothing that stands out in the acting. The characters are stereotypical and, if you ask me, redundant. What stood out to me was the effects. First of all, the fight scenes were rather entertaining. For all you knew, you were watching a John Woo shootout (okay, maybe not John Woo). I'm not one for comparing movies to see how they portray possessed people. But you really gotta give these guys props for their effects and portrayal. It wasn't the typical Linda Blair. It was more like a special effects upgrade to the usual demonic possession.So if you watch movies just for effects, you'll probably get a kick out of this. The r-rating is for sexuality (no nudity), language and graphic violence. Don't take it seriously. Just enjoy it for what it offers."
4,Big Fun,"Man, what a trip! Usually, if a movie tries really hard to be campy and funny, it fails miserably. This one hits it just right. Hilarious, fast-paced, great-looking, and creative. Love those flourescent nun zombies!"
3,Not a bad movie,I'd give it 3 stars.I was looking for a decent 'bunch of sexy young people head off to a secluded place and get slaughtered' flic last night and thought i'd try this one.I loved Adrienne Barbeau since Swamp Thing so when i saw her name on the box it was decided.The opening was good as others have said but i was kind of disappointed that they dumped the horror potential of the dead nuns and went straight to the schlocky demons so soon.Anyways the cast was fresh and worked together well which is half the battle in these movies.Some things made me laugh out loud like the flashback to her days in the convent 40 yrs ago when the nuns became demons and punished the students with paddles.There were other little moments of great dialogue in the movie like the scene between the 2 virgins that are tied up together at the end.Adrienne was ok but could've been a little more over the top .Convent shouldn't be decribed as being in the same league as my sacred Evil Dead 2 but it's not bad at all.
1,Don't be fooled by the other reviews.....,"I'm serious -- don't be fooled by the other reviews here that give this movie five stars (FIVE stars?!?!?! Inconceivable!) No, do not be fooled -- this movie sucks. It starts off okay, and it even builds to some modicum of suspense, but once people start turning into demons, this turkey becomes a hyper-active, superficial, shoot-em-up, utraviolent, Tarrantino wannabe and takes a nosedive straight into the ground.Please, trust me. Don't waste your time. Avoid this mess. I want the 90 minutes of my life I spent watching this pile of junk back."
2,A horror movie for 12 year-olds,"I liked some of the characters in the movie, but I have to give it a bad rating because it definitly was not scary and the speical effects looked very fake and cheap.If you are older than 12, then avoid this movie. Its only for kids."
4,Lots to like,"I watched this because I watch anything Timothy Spall does. He has a smaller part, but is brilliant, again. Yet everyone else does a fine job a well. Frank harper demonstrates he can play the gamut, as a vicious thug whose look stops clocks. Olivia Williams gradually and reluctantly falls in love, and does so beleivably and tenderly.There are no caricatures in here, none of the cartoons that people American prison stories. Losers, bad people, and crooks are in prison, and most belong there. But they can change, can grow and can do better.Warm, funny, understated, and clever. Nice job."
3,Not what I expected,"The short version: That cats are enjoying the toy. The description ""assorted"" is for a one toy order.Fully version: I do not usually write reviews, however, I was a bit disappointed when I received my order. I admit that when I read assorted I thought I was buying an assortment of cat toys. I received the turtle. It is cute and the cats do enjoy the toy. My rating ""it's okay"" is based on the fact that I thought I was getting 3 toys for the price, which then would counteract the shipping that I paid (shipping = double the price....for one toy)."
3,Interesting,This book was my second What's the big idea? book. I had previously read Women's rights. I found it OK but I felt it went around in circles and didn't argue. Before I knew it it was over and I had learned nothing except 3 little incidents when doctors had made mistakes.
1,Boring!!!,"I purchased this book hoping to sit down and read an exciting narrative on the ATF and the early days of the agency. Boy was I mistaken. This is an extremely boring book. If you've heard one moonshine story, you've heard a million. Weems recycles the same story over and over for the reader. Very disappointing book."
5,A sly thriller that inspires a lot of thought.,"OK, so the first time I read ""Carabolia"", I didn't get it. The mixed reviews intrigued me, and I liked ""Crematorium"", but this one seemed misguided at first glance, like a key chapter had been deleted. I tossed it aside. Then I discovered that I couldn't stop thinking about it; I couldn't get the characters out of my mind.About one month later, I was at a book party and talked about it with someone who had a completely different take on the story. After she explained it to me, things started to fit together in my mind. And I went back and read the book again!! I mean, I never do that! And I loved it! This subtle, sly thriller works on levels that the casual reader never suspects and accomplishes things that popular fiction wouldn't dare.I won't give you the key to understanding it---read the book and figure it out yourself. It's well worth it!"
1,A waste of paper,"I cannot see what the other reviewers saw in this book? Poorly written,stupid plot,a complete waste of time.Spend your money on a real book, not this one."
5,Awesome A3 running shoe,"I love these shoes, and like any serious runner,I'm not concerned about style,but about performance, and this shoe delivers like no other shoe I've ever had! I run every day, and since I started using the A3 transfer runners I doubled my distance. No more pain in the joints or shins, it's like running on air!! I just got 2 more pairs,cause like everything else, they'll probably stop making them. If you're serious about running, get them while they last!!!"
4,Very Happy with A3 Transfer Running Womens,"Call me nuts but, i always run in Nike Shox. Yes, Nuts!I got a pair of A3 and I absolutely love it! Very comfortable and I do like the look of them. I will be buying back up pairs in case they discotinue them. Love them."
5,"Funny, Honest Book For Engineers/Scientists","This book is really funny and honest account of this guy's first years at a crappy engineering job. For me it was a fun book because I could completely see myself in his shoes if my life in engineering took an unfortunate turn. If you are a male engineer/scientist, I think you'll enjoy it how I did, but if you are not, I think you'll find it a funny glimpse into the often weird/sad world of underachieving engineers."
5,A real treat!,"If you've ever worked in a corporate bureaucracy (not necessarily an engineering one), you'll love Shopper Jim's consistent ability to tell it like it is. What's more, if you've been in the workforce, you've most likely met and worked with most of the characters in the book... some of whom are heartbreaking, others despicable, all true-to-life. A little bit of slapstick keeps the pace manageable. An absolute must read for anyone who's an engineer or is thinking about becoming one; certainly of interest to anyone else (my retired mom loved it). If you're a displaced Long Islander, you'll also enjoy the local flavor."
4,Delightful!,A great alternative to the muzak of Manheim Steamroller and et al...I just wish that Amazon.com would have it in stock!
5,Wonderful and no nonsense,"I had actually thought about entering the field of mortuary science. This book was a major eye opener for me. I was always familiar with funeral practice since I was a teenager. I didn't take the bait!!! I think the whole notion of green burial is where the funeral industry will head sooner or later. I've since found out there is a very old cemetery located in Asheville N.C. that has come on board with the ""hybrid"" woods in which to do green burials. Thank you for this great publication. MBH"
5,I have a different view on the grave and what matters.,"I very much enjoyed this book and it's content will make you re-think the views and preconceived ideas I ""had"" on funerals and after life care of the dead, rather the lack of it. I think the author did an extensive job of researching a varied and not always pleasant picture of how ""we"" care for our deceased from embalming to cremation and beyond.I would recommend this book to anyone that thinks they would like to learn more about afterlife care and how society deals with a subject not many folks want to dwell on."
5,Grave Matters: A Journey Through the Modern Funeral industry to a Natural Way of Burial,"This is an excellent exploration of several forms of disposition of a body leading chapter by chapter to a very logical concluding chapter on ""green burial"". Each chapter has been carefully researched and is given sympathetic coverage. The book is very well written and contains extremely useful information for anyone wishing to find out about the subject before actually needing to know! I highly recommend it.Grace Schoedelpresident, Champaign County (Illinois) Funeral Consumers Alliance"
5,A Great Book on a Difficult Subject..,"These pages do the human race a great service. Every Funeral Director needs to read this book. Death is not a pleasant subject. This book is more than worth the price. Everyone has trouble thinking about grave matters. Just as cremation came to America, so comes the green funeral. This book is the future in Funerals, it is well thought out, researched and well written. Practical How to tips are in the back of each chapter. Everyone needs to read these tips. Everyone! Great work, Mark Harris.Funeral Directors please read this book with an open mind. Personally, I have found this book helpful in my work with families in the Funeral Profession."
1,not good,this table wasnt designed very well. half of the threads were full of paint not a very tightly put together piece of furniture
1,Very difficult to put together!! Awful Instructions!!,"I never did get this together with all the pieces, I also bought for my daughter 2 toys boxes (no problem putting those together!) and 2 toy organizers (no problem here too!) both from the same company, BUT this was a nightmare. I ended up throwing it away, I could not get it to work, nor could my mechanical husband. PLEASE save your money, this will frustrate you!!!"
3,Good but continuous problems when turning it on,"After a year of buying it, this laptop is working okay, but it's been at least 15 times that, when turning it on, a disk error happens and it asks me to restart. I once had to reinstall the drivers because it wasn't working. I don't know if this powering on is harmless, but it is annoying, since it's a brand new machine."
1,not for writing appellate briefs,"The tone of much of this book is condescending, the ideas oversimplified. This made the suggestions in this book, while they could be somewhat useful, offensive and almost useless to read (e.g., when analyzing your side and ""their"" side, identify ""potential 'goods'"" and ""potential 'bads'""). Give me a break.And the model brief -- let's just say if you use the one in this book as a model, you will make a fool of yourself. Take a look instead at Garner's Legal Writing in Plain English - good advice without simplistic language or broken grammar rules. The whirlybird is the best, plus the book helps you get off the ground if you're stuck beginning."
3,Not what I expected,"While the book might be great for some people, it wasn't at all what I expected. This doesn't really have much to do with drawing, but producing anime. I was more interested in drawing techniques versus laying out story boards, printing, selling, etc."
1,Terrible.,Doggeral trash at best. A horrible 'guide' that will influence future hacks to create their own trashy lazy work at worst. This book promises originality in its title but then goes on to show a bunch of amateurish imitative artwork as its examples. That the author trashes other 'how to draw manga' books is laughable when this book is such poor quality. I suspect that the people giving positive reviews of this waste of money are more swayed by the pretentious and misguided text in it than by the author's actual teaching or drawing talent. Want manga in your own unique style? You are better off studying traditional drawing technique without manga influence and then evolving into your own style as a consequence of being a strong artist regardless of whether you draw manga style or not. You will learn more about drawing better quality Manga through the teachings of George Bridgeman or Robert Beverly Hale than you will trusting an over-opinionated hack artist who trashes other mediocre talent.
4,Awesome,"This book was incredibly helpful. I went from terrible triangle-chested men to moderate drawings of just about anyone. You need to have basic drawing ability, (freely/cheaply gotten from Manga University (howtodrawmanga.com) ) but this, I believe, will definitely bring you up a notch."
3,Not many examples,"This book just goes on and on and on talking about the steps in drawing manga. But in rarely ever gives you a line by line example. If you are intersested in learning about what manga is and reading about the steps, this book would be perfect for you. Again reading it gives you most of the steps in only words."
3,Complementarity book to people that have some drawing skill,This is a ok book but since I am starting from scratch its not that helpful to me it dose not have enough examples to get me off my feet. BUT with a couple basic life drawing books that cover the basics I think this would become one of the better how to draw manga books as the author seeks to teach what is manga and not merely duplicate it.
5,This is the BEST book on drawing manga,"This book is great, step by step guide to drawing your own manga. not copying someone else's style."
5,a poetic verse!,"walk with me is a beautiful story of a young girl taking a walk with her mother and expolring the outdoors-- the sights, sounds and smells! it's a perfect book to curl up and read together at naptime or bedtime because it ends with a restful sleep. we liked it so much we named our second child after the author--naomi!"
5,Tough and Durable,"Since I only use my generator in really awful weather when I lose power, I like having the extra robustness of this cord as well as its bright color."
5,Works well,Ordered it in a pinch with rush delivery for pending storm. Glad I did as the power went out 2 days later. Used if to 2 days without issues. It is now sitting ready to go for the next time. Plug fir both generator and wall mount securely. Didnt get warm even when drawing 30A. Wish it was longer but I bought what was available at the time.
3,Some (questionable) metrics,"This book was published in June 2002. The Nasdaq index peaked in March 2000, and that is taken as the high water market of the high technology boom, a grouping which encompasses the dot coms, startup telecoms and the biotechs. So you might read this book as a retrospective on those times. Especially if you had fruitlessly invested some of your own funds in any of those startups.Kettell's ideas for new metrics by which to evaluate these and future startups are interesting. Though some (many?) might consider these to be discredited by the multiyear slump after March 2000, and the resultant bankruptcies of numerous startups. It was then said that the traditional metrics of performance were still best, and time-tested."

5,RIVERDANCE-THE SHOW,IT IS THE BEST MUSICAL THAT HAVE SEEN. THE COORDINATION OF THE DANCERS IS EXCELLENT. IT IS A TRUE WORK OF TEAM. IT SEEMS THAT THEY FLOAT IN THE AIR WHEN THEY JUMP
2,Riverdance,"I purchased Riverdance as a gift for my father, he said he enjoyed it and was happy with it thank you"
4,Magic Irish feet.,"Now somewhat dated, but still an excellent video of what was a breathtaking new phenomenon in stage dance. If you saw the original show, this video will bring back happy memories. If you didn't it will give you a taste of what you missed -- and probably make you regret having missed it."
2,A Very Late Review of Riverdance (the Show),"I'm not the sort to give things a bad review because it is 'cool and trendy'. Way too old for that. But I have to say that I am glad I checked this video out at the rental store before buying.Really it's quite bad. Not that the dancing isn't phenomenal (Michael rules!), but it lacks soul. Hubby and I like Celtic music --old ""Shepherd's Hey"" fans-- and we get to see Celtic dancing locally (though amateur) and we both found this video disappointing.The principal problem is the 'homogenization' of the singing. It is sort of Celtic music for elevators. The second problem is the Flamenco dancer. Having seen a top rank group from Spain at Wolftrap, I have to say that this lady has got no 'attitude' and the music.... please, don't get me started.Two Stars. Could have used a plot. Could have used some 'edge' to both the singing and dancing. Lots of people adore this video but if you are a fan of traditional Irish dance and song, you might want to rent first."
5,river dance the show,river dance the show was a very great show i enjoyed it very much if you never seen micheal flatley's shows i reckamend to you to see his shows he is a very good tap dancerAndreaMartell
5,The Best one I've seen (no DVD),"My DVD player plays the video ""Riverdance, The Show"", very well. I also have a DVD, of Riverdance; NY, but miss several scenes from the original Show, including the Spanish dancer some of the music and Flatley of course. Amazon says I have the DVD ""Riverdance The Show""on order, but I don't remember ordering it. Probably been on order since I got a DVD player which was quite a few years ago. But since I still have the video, and it plays very well, I'm not worried. Several videos I did keep and really like but are not available on DVD. Among them are ""Out on a Limb"" and the ""original"" ""Wicker Man."""
4,Where the hell is Eileen Ivers?,"Michael Flatley IS Riverdance even if he is an arrogant jerk. His performance is electric! HOWEVER, I bought this video to see EILEEN IVERS on her blue fiddle and couldn't find it on the tape. She's on the CD of the same name doing a piece called ""The Harvest"". What's up with that? The video I rented at the store featured her. I feel a little ripped off..."
2,I Don't See Why People Like This,"I'm sorry, but I really don't! It's a style called Celtic Drama, which means it's a combination of stories w/o words and traditional Irish Dancing.I've never been a Michael Flatley person.Parts of this are traditional Irish dancing, but other's aren't anywhere near it! There are also long songs, sort of like a choir piece. I don't like those at all.If you want to see traditional Irish dancing, this is not your movie."
1,Skip this one! - Buy Lord of the Dance!,"If you are new to the phenomenon that started with Michael Flatley and Riverdance, skip the Riverdance video, and start with Lord of the Dance!Unlike Riverdance, Lord of the Dance is visual and musical PERFECTION from start to finish. The only reason to buy Riverdance would be for the historical aspect of seeing how it all started."
4,Good product but the cost-cutting shows,"As noted by reviewers of the propane version, assembly isn't easy due to cryptic instructions. In my case a crucial part (bottom shelf) arrived severely bent and had to be coaxed back into shape. There is clear evidence of cost-cutting in fit (the doors) and finish (no paint on the corners of the control panel, which is already showing signs of rust). That said, this is a powerful grill that heats up quickly and performs well."
5,Weber Spirit E-310,"This grill is great. Took about 1 hour to put together, simple assembly.Came with the gas quick connect valve, 3 burners are perfect for our family of 3. I recomend this grill highly."
3,"Doors ajar, holes didn't line up","It works fine but shoddy workmanship was evident.One of the stainless steel in front droops a quarter inch from it's mate when closed - looks cheap. Also the back panel holes didn't line up and had to be enlarged with a Dremel grinder to install. The holes in the washers that go with sheet metal screw were too small and had to be tweaked to fit. There was a ripple (bent) in the side panel that was fairly minor but had to be coaxed to get holes to line up. The friction fit ""hub"" that hammers on the end of the axle to hold the wheel on goes on crooked if your lucky enough to get it on at all as the metal part shifts inside its plastic trim piece. Watch out you don't smash your finger or the piece goes bonging off . They give you an extra one but it's a poor system."
4,Great grill value,"For a mid-sized grill, this product works very well. It heats up fast and has plenty of thermal energy. It takes about 45 minutes to assemble. It arrives in a fairly large box which did not survive the shipping all that well - however, the product itself arrived in good if not perfect shape. Overall I would highly recommend this appliance if it fits your size requirements."
3,*meh*,I love Gail Sheehy but this isn't one of her best books. There was nothing groundbreaking that I hadn't already read somewhere else. Try Pathfinders. That WAS groundbreaking.
4,Read Livermore (1940) instead of Smitten (2006),"This book is, by historic accounts, Jesse Livermore's suicide note. He describes his trading methods - ever so careful of misplacing readers' trust. He talks about markets of the 1920's and 1940's - making careful distinction between ""narrow"" (straightforward) and ""deep"" (whipsaw) markets, about psychological pitfalls, sector rotation and even pairs trading.This book reads a lot like W.D. Gann's presentation, definitely not as entertaining as ""Reminiscences of a Stock Operator"" - but more to the point.The best part of this book is that you don't have to pay to some contemporary commentator to hear the voice of the original author. Full PDF text of this book is available through Wikipedia's entry for Jesse Livermore at[...]."
4,Nostalgic yet delightful,"This book is, by historic accounts, Jesse Livermore's suicide note. He describes his trading methods - ever so careful of misplacing readers' trust. He talks about markets of the 1920's and 1940's - making careful distinction between ""narrow"" (straightforward) and ""deep"" (whipsaw) markets, about psychological pitfalls, sector rotation and even pairs trading.This book reads a lot like W.D.

Full PDF text of this book is available through Wikipedia's entry for Jesse Livermore athttp://stockvision.org/books/Jesse_Livermore-How_To_Trade_In_Stocks_(1940_original)-EN.pdf"
1,"Very disappointing, avoid.","I didn't like this book at all. I loved loved loved ""Reminiscences of a Stock Operator"" and wanted to know more about Livermore, but I don't think this book is the way to do it. I didn't get anything more out of this book than Reminiscences of a Stock Operator and it's a tenth as much enjoyable.In this genre I have just finished ""Way(s) of the Turtle"" by Curtis Faith and I found that to be an excellent read. In fact i'm already re-reading some chapters. If you haven't already, read either of those two first."
1,How to Trade In Stocks,"With this book Smitten tried to sensationalize Jesse livermore and his trading method and succeeded in neither only to come up with the most boring rubbish ever written about the great speculator. Be warned, this book is entirely fiction apart from a few original quotes lifted from Reminiscences. Even Jesse's trading method hasn't escaped Smitten's ""interpretation"".Unfortunately there isn't much historical evidence available about Livermore, and to see him being recreated or fictionalized so uncharacteristically through the eyes of an inept writer serves no purpose at all. This is no way to treat a legend."
1,How do you sell the same book twice?,"Like many of the readers who bought this book, I was at a loss to understand why Richard Smitten would remove some of the original work written by Jesse Livermore. Now we know the reason. He just published another book apparently putting back what he took out the first time. Don't buy this particular edition or you will be disappointed."
2,Thought I was buying just Livermore's book reprinted!,"The editing is pathetic as if it was slapped together and thrown out there in rough draft. The book repeats itself over and over as if to fill up pages, p.65 caption refers to charts of INTL and semi ind. with charts of LU and telecom ind. above it, and publisher ads, too. I got almost as much out of ""Reminiscences of a stock operator"" (about Livermore) as I did this. There are some good points from Livermore, I think, hard to tell his words from Smitten additions. Hate that. Livermore market key is worth it, but I'm steering clear of this publisher in the future."
5,"""The Practical Manual Of The Markets And Trading It.",This is a practical manual which can be applied right in the middle of the market hours.There are no theoretical concepts as preached by theoretical gurus today. This is a book on the subtle distinctions made on the price behaviour of stocks and the markets besides the psychology and belief systems a speculator/trader must possess in order to succed.A must read for those willing to improve their trading performances.
1,"Nice story-telling book, not much more...","I had previously read the 'Remininscenses of a Stock Operator', which I found to be an interesting story and hence I decided to read this book hoping for some concrete trading ideas.Unfortunately, it was a total waste o $13+pp and a few days' time.The author uses some fancy terms (thought of by himself), makes some analogies to a friend of his from the army, but eventually I do not feel more educated even by the smallest of margins.Any ""advice"" ""offered"" is very vague and the entire book is very thin.Actually it leaves the impression of those $100 books sold on the internet containing the secrets that reveal the stock market's holy grail and will only be sold in a few houndred copies, so that only a few selected ones will be let into the ""circle of stock market future tycoons""."
5,worth reading forever!,"I know Jesse Livermore from the book by Bill O'Neil of Investor's Business Daily.After I got this book, I can not stop reading it until I finish it.It is the best book I have ever read about trading.Although it is not perfect because of three chapters removed by Richard Smitten, but you can learn much more than you anticipated. Timming,money management,emotion control,always are the key to successful trading."
3,Interesting Book,"The Livermore written part is intersting. The Smitten part repeats the Livermore part over and over. The Livermore explanation at the back is so far incomprehensible. Now, if that was explained Smitten would have something!"
2,Truncated version of original book with added material.,"I have a really fragile copy of a reprint of the this book printed in 1966. I purchased this edition so I could have a newer copy which would not have pages falling out of it. Unfortunately the editors have already removed three chapters of Livermore material and replaced them with original material by Richard Smitten. The Smitten material is ok, but it should have been added to the original book as an appendix not as a substitute for the last three chapters written by Livermore.The original book was only 112 pages long and the material from that book stops at page 56 in this new edition leaving you with around 122 pages of new material not written by Livermore. For that sin I can only give this book two stars."
2,The part written by Livermore is worth 5 stars...,"Jesse Livermore must be wearing holes in his funeral clothes turning in his grave about the butchery that Smitten and Trader's Press have perpetrated on his book. Never before have I seen so many errors in punctuation, spelling, and grammar. Did a fourth grader edit the manuscript? Furthermore, it is difficult to determine which words were actually written by Livermore and which parts were added. Since the ""Livermore Key"" is printed in this edition exactly as it appeared in the original (1940) edition, one may surmise that Trader's Press has an entire copy of the original. Why not just reproduce the original exactly at it was printed in 1940 to maintain some coherency? This book was jam-packed with ads for Smitten's and Trader's Press other books. However, the part actually written by Livermore is pure gold."
3,"I wanted to like this book, but...","I am a big fan of alternative histories, and something of a Civil War buff. I REALLY wanted to like this book. The premise is plausible, and the action is pretty gripping. However, apparently NO-ONE PROOFREAD THE DAD-BLAMED THING! It is chock-full o' errors. Not just typos(and they abound! ), but glaring factual mistakes which could have been avoided with a brief glance at any textbook. For example, Confederate General James Longstreet is referred to as ""Peter Longstreet"". Longstreet's troops nicknamed him ""Old Pete"", and this apparently led the author to believe this important historical figure's name was ""Peter"". Spend five minutes checking your facts, dude! Errors like this ruined the ""suspension of disbelief"" that alternative history stories, more than other stories, require to be succesful. A tiny amount of research could have helped immensely. Nice try, though."
2,Not good,"The concept is a good one but it suffers from horrible dialogue and innacurate research. If you're going to write about the soldiers of the civil war at least do some research on their rations, their accountrements, their daily life etc. Pretty bad."
3,Scolding the 2nd review of this book,I think it's 'absurd' to post a review of a book you haven't yet read.
1,"Useless, Poorly written, Inadequate information","Entire sections of the MTEL are not even covered here. As others have mentioned there are typos..... I wrote to the publisher who corresponded with me until I asked her to provide ALL the information I was missing, then I never heard from her again.This book was apparently written for a teacher test in another state...given a new cover and sold at a ridiculous price.Save your money. Try another title or research the stuff you need online or at the library."
1,A Joke,"The only words that I can think of to describe this book are ""utter garbage"". The amount of spelling and grammatical errors in it are ridiculous. I can't believe that this book is actually out there as a study guide. I thought it was a joke at first - and it was - a $60 joke that I had to pay for."
3,Wagon Train Season 5 arrives early,"I also bought this early today at Sam's club. Surprised to see it there for $39.99 as I was expecting it in early May. Haven't watched any episodes, will let you know what I think of thr quality when I do."
2,"Timeless Media, Please!!!!!!!","Bought today from Sams Club. Must have got in early. This is the worst season set I have seen from this company. Have purchased the previous 4 seasons. They say the episodes are taken from the original Universal master tapes. I don't know what vault these were stored in but they might have to check their storage methods because these sure look dupey as well as worn out quality. On disc 9, the Frank Carter Story, you will need 3D glasses because the entire episode is ghosting throughout the entire show. Gave me a headache after a few minutes and had to turn off. Terrible quality, I hope that Universal treats their other shows better than this. The shows themselves are great just the poor picture and sound quality of the episodes."
3,Poor packaging - good series,"Where do I start, the tin outer box prevents it from being stored with other DVDs. The inner box is pressed cardboard, two of the ""pages"" had separated. DVDs are easily scratched if not properly handled, causing skips and picture freezing. This set stores each DVD in slots in the cardboard. They can be scratched going in and sliding the out, not to mention the fingerprints you have to put on them in the attempt to remove them. If you plan on watching them more than once I suggest you provide your own storage cases.The series, however, is pretty good. The picture quality is fine and so is the sound. If you like westerns from this period you won't be disappointed. Enjoy"
1,"Good Movie, Crappy Sound/Picture","I always enjoyed this van Cleef movie. That said, whomever did the transfer job totally, and completely, butchered it. Horrible. Buy some other version, definitely NOT this one!"
1,Dated and not enough information,This may have been released on DVD in 2004 but it was obviously filmed much earlier. The included printable pamphlet is dated 1986 and video appears to be about the same time. They attempt to cover so much material in so little time that it's really just an overview of what it takes to remodel a kitchen. It provides little value for the do it yourself viewer.
2,The cd could have been better,"The cd could have been better..it just wasn't what I had expected, but it did have a few songs on it that I wanted & enjoy. The delivery service was exteremely excellent! Thanks Amazon! Lori"
1,Hypocrisy- they shot and killed an animal for real just to film this,"Even though the movie is about protecting endangered antelopes, a protected species of gazelle, fitted with antelope horns, who worked with the filmmakers and crew throughout the filming, was actually shot and killed to create the scene in which an antelope is shot. What hypocrisy. The cast and crew were not warned and were upset."
3,"Interesting, but nothing special","The movie is much slower-paced than I expected after reading other reviews. No major complaints in the execuition of the storyline, acting or dialog; I just found it only mildly interesting. [My wife was downright bored.]The one thing that really stood out for me is how they concluded the movie. Without spoiling, basically all of the sub-plots do come to resoution. What struck me as odd is how they jump from one person to the next in short clips. Kudos on an unique approach to not leave loose ends, but I didn't really like it. I guess I'd say that editing was biggest downfall of the film."
5,Women and Girls of Science,"A thoroughly enjoyable look at some women and girls in science. Well written and interestingly presented research. Mentions some well known and some lesser known scientists. Has a section on top science fair projects prepared by girls. Superb book design. Uses collage and watercolor creating a log book/scrap book effect. Karen Woodworth-Roman, Children's Science Book Review"
1,Poor Quality and Unusable For My Purposes,I purchased a few of these to extend the cables on my Logitech 5.1 computer speaker system. When I plugged them in the sound was greatly diminshed. I had to turn up the sound quite a bit to hear anything out the speakers. I'm sure I will fine some use for them but their junk and won't work for what I intended. The purchase experience was good.
2,male male,"the cables are better quality than shown but are male male, not male female. i ordered five of them to extend my pc serond sound for my new apartment. i wish i could use them but to do so i need a male to female junction.i don't even think they're 25 ft. i gave 2 stars instead of 1 because delivery was fast and the quality is better than expected."
1,Bad customer support,"I ordered 1 RCA male/ 1 RCA female extension cable from this seller, but what I received is a RCA male/ RCA male extension cable. I contacted them through e-mail but there was no response from their side. Please don't buy this item from wholesale cables."
5,Excellant service!,Excellant service. Product was delivered extremly fast. Very pleased with the packaging. Excellant product for the price. Will be ordering more products from vendor. Product was exactly want I needed.
4,It Works! What else can be said?,It Works! What else can be said? I purchased several of these and have used them for over a year now. They all have worked well.
1,Do Not Waste your time and money on this,"i got these for my Logitech X-540 5.1 Surround Sound Speaker System with Subwoofer and my rear speakers are not even 5 feet away from my computer and i couldnt hear anything unless i am 6 inch away from them, the only way to hear them is to max your sound in everything,the sound quality is also bad. do not buy this"
1,Male to male instead of male to female,Same problem as most others here. They sent male to male instead of male to female. Not Amazon's fault. They were very helpful. Amazon said they would investigate product and description.
1,Wrong Product Description,"Product Description say "" This solidly constructed 25ft Male to Female extension cable...""; however this product both side is Male extension..... Wrong product or wrong description ....."
3,RCA Male to female,"The vidio was not clear, I orded, but I am not goig to use it. A better quality picture is the VGA cable."
1,Poor Service,"you sent me the wrong connectors. I ordered two with one male, one female. You sent two male connectors. I want two new cables sent here free of charge with one male, one female connector. Thank you."
5,Blank aluminum bracelets,"did really good on beaded bracelet, and the leather wraps around really nice, a really good product. bend's really good to fit wrist. small"
3,Somewhat accurate,"The book tells most of everything well.... (some say we are allpoor and ignorant)...but all of my kids have or are attending college. I havelived here all 43 years of my life. My children grew up with most ofthe ""church burners,"" and we are also kin to some of them. My daughter has been by the church that was burned more than 500 times, and she did not know that it was a church until all of this happened. She thought that it was just an old run down building with a caved in roof. No, she is not an ignorant, poor, white trash country girl that does not know anything. In fact she is attending college now on academic scholarships to become a doctor. Yes, it was wrong for them to burn the builing, even if it wasn't a church, but the author stereotyped the people of Little River. He should have researched a little bit more, or at least interviewed more teenagers and their families before writing this book."
1,An untruth,This book is filled with untruth about real people that had no idea they were being put in the story. It leads you to believe the south is poor and uneducated. I did not like this book at all because of knowing the untruth told in it.
1,lover,"this book is another one of those self help for christian books I find it disagreeable that the christian community has to have this many of them when we already have a 1,500pg bible that most people don't even read."
3,Free-styled,"This eclectic collection of poetry is written in a range of styles as wide and free as the topics themselves. Some poems are cleverly written, and the illustrations are oodles of fun, but the rhythm of the poetry is sometimes sporadic, and some of the words are pure nonsense, with a tendancy to wax annoying at times."
1,Israeli Propaganda,"Knowing what we know now about the complex issues of Palestinian and Israeli rule in this land - the title alone is problematic. The film itself, however, reads like pure propaganda for Israeli occupation of these lands that were to be shared. Ironically, at times it feels more like a Reifenstahl film extolling the ""superior Germanic race."" Though made in the 60's it often feels like the 40's newsreel style compilation of clips. Were it as beautiful as ""I Am Cuba"" - also a propaganda film sponsored by Communist Russia on behalf of the Cuban government, it would at least have some redeeming quality. The footage can be interesting historically, but such a lopsided presentation perpetuates the depiction of the pre-Israel non-Jewish residents of Palestine as simple-minded camel-herders whose children bathe in the same water with cattle. In this respect it was painful to sit through as with any film we now know to be racist."
5,My VAN looks great!,"good price as always from amazon. You need a little muscle to stretch this on but it fits great and makes a simple van look sporty and it covered all the dents and nicks in the front. the material is leather looking and breaths nice. the instructions recommend to pull the ""bra"" off after it rains on it but all you have to do it wipe it down underneath, easy really. ENJOY"
4,Many useful phrases,The level is above what I am ready for but the content is useful as well as giving many alternatives for expressing similar thoughts.
1,Caution! This product is discontinued by the publisher!,"From [the website]:""Mobile WinFax 1.0 has been discontinued - effective as of May 24th.""Fee-based technical support will be available until June 30th, 2000. On-line technical support will be available until August 21st, 2000. There will be no replacement product.""As a Palm VII/VIIx user, I would strongly suggest wireless users try J2.com or other products available at rovenet.com, but there is no Symantec support for this product. (Which is completely typical for Symantec; see Norton CrashGuard and Norton Desktop under extinct-ware.)"
5,best bang for your buck,"I was a men's wardrobe consultant for several years and in working with men on their fashion, I also assisted them with mens goods such as dopp kits. I have seen many dopp kits but I have never seen one of this quality and size at this price. The rich blue canvas is beautiful with the butterscotch colored leather trim. The kit not only looks nice but also has very durable construction. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
1,Opening is way too small,"This product and price is terrific..until you try to get something in it. The zipper opening does not permit even a hand to slide in withoutgetting scratched from the zipper. Putting in and removing something bulky like, say, a can of shaving cream is nearly impossible. I have struggled with it to the point of not giving these as a gifts anymore. It's certainly otherwise well-made, very attractive and at an unbelievable price and for anyone who needs to travel with a lot of items it would appear to be perfect but it is not."
2,Great idea-- not so great product,The hidden scoop is a great idea. I loved the design--holding the scoop upright and hiding the scooper. But the scoop itself was very flimsy and cheap & ended up flicking what we were trying to pick up... kinda gross! We were disappointed and ended up throwing it away.
5,Used for 7+ years,"I have owned 2 of these, one for 7 years, and this one that I recently purchased. I have no idea what other reviewers are talking about when they say the handle breaks under strain, never had that problem myself. I really like the container it sits in. It grabs and holds any extra cat litter that might fall off the scoop."
3,Holes in the back of scoop,Makes it hard to get the little pieces (EW)... But it looks really nice and has it's own storage so I guess I can deal.
1,Not very sturdy,After two months of use the handle bent and now the scoop is barely usable. The scoop is not sturdy enough. This is the first time I had a litter scoop break. If you need to do real scooping this is not the right tool for the job.
3,"Almost perfect, but one really annoying design flaw","Love the hinged holder, and the scoop has held up under several months of 3x daily scooping of seven litter boxes. However, the scalloped edge causes some problems. Unless every clump is suspended in the litter away from any wall of the box, and unless every poop is perfect, the scalloped front edge of the scoop tends to break up clumps and get stuck in the poop. Since we have a couple of cats who like to use the perimeter of the box instead of dead center, this makes for an unneccessarily difficult scooping experience. If it weren't for that, I'd have a few more of these instead of continuing the hunt for the (probably non-existent) perfect litter scoop."
5,Great product,Bought this as a part of the Booda dome liter system. This scope is big and easy to use. It sits right back in its stand nicely. Great product!
3,Color wrong,The scoop itself is not the greatest. I wanted a certain color and was very disappointed when another color came. I wanted a scoop to match her litter box. It's not the sturdiest scooper but it will do for now. For the price I'll keep it-seems such a headache to return it.
2,Not Good For Me,"It was not very practical for me. Too light on the bottom,so it makes it hard to open without touching it."
3,"great holder, POOR scooper","I purchased really for the container, it's a great idea (and that reason alone gives it the 3 stars). However, the scooper itself feels really filmsy. I would use my older scooper instead if it would fit in the holder. NOTE TO MAKER: I would pay a few dollars more if the quality would improve on scooper handle. I would not recommend to someone."
1,Not pleased,"I liked the holder for the scoop however the scoop was flimsey & bent & cracked while scooping.Booda Scoop'N Hide Litter Scoop, Titanium"
3,Booda Scoop,"The Booda Scoop works pretty good. It is nice that it can be stored inside it's case so that the dirty scoop is hidden while not in use. But the scoop itself is a little too ""bendy"" and is sometimes hard to use on heavier litter/debris."
2,Bad for clumping cat litter,"I bought this scooper to try to solve the problem of a nasty loose scooper laying around. I love the thing it sets in, but hate the scooper. I spent $10 on this scooper, and wound up buying another one at Menards a couple weeks later for $.94 because of the way this one performs. I had never thought much about scoopers before this one. However, the end of this is jagged. What happens is it doesn't scoop up the clump of urine well, and instead breaks it up into those little pieces that you can never scoop out of the clumping litter. I have never given a product a negative review before, but I wanted to send a ""beware"" message for anyone thinking about this that uses the clumping litter."
1,Booda scooper,Worked well but broke easily. This happened after 4 weeks of usage. 3 of the tines cracked near the front end of the scooper.
4,Nice hiden scoop!,"I like that I can just grab this scoop and go. The only drawback (why I deducted one star) is that the base does not stay open when I use the scoop so I have to manually open it when done. Still a nice looking, and sturdy scoop at a very reasonable price."
3,its ok - but not great,the holder is great - reduces the mess and keep the scoop handy but the the scoop itself is flimsy. it feels like it will break in half when i try to scoop up the clumps from the bottom of the box.
2,booda scoop,"not worth the price, and not easy to use. Light weight and clumsy with regard to inserting in place and retreiving it to use.....besides, I returned the Booda Dome that is was purchased for."
5,The Best Instrumental Rock Christmas Music,"I have both volumes of Merry Axemas and other instrumental rock Christmas CDs. This is by far the best one. He plays interesting arrangements of these songs but does not screw them up. Unlike Gary Hoey, a guitarist I really admire, Neil uses real musicians on all the songs. Of course as aways, Neil's playing is top notch. If you like instrumental rock and Christmas music, buy this right now."
2,Poor star vehicle,"Poor star vehicle proves why normal story telling dominates the industry, while in this DVD you only watch famous great actors ""do their thing"" with the very least developing story."
1,Is NOT Active Shutter 3D - Comes with Red/Green Glasses,"I have a 3D TV and bought this Blu-Ray disc based on Amazon's product description that stated ""To watch this movie in Blu-ray 3D, you will need a 3D-capable television that comes with active-shutter glasses and a 3D-capable Blu-ray player"". When it arrived I was a bit concerned to see that it came with two pairs of red and green filtered glasses and there was no mention of 3D TVs on the box. There were two discs though, so I hoped one of them contained a proper 3D movie for 3D TVs - No such luck so I returned it, which to Amazon's credit, was a very simple experience actually. I just printed out a UPS return label from Amazon's website and dropped it off at my nearest UPS Store and hopefully they're paying for it. Amazon needs to change their product description otherwise they're going to get a lot of returns."
1,beware,you wont be able to used your glasses to wacht the movie they included two paper glasses that made the movie look awfull and the phony thing they wont let you know prior to make your purchase be aware people
1,One of the worst horror movies EVER!,"I hated this movie. I'm a huge fan of the previous ""Final Destinations"" but this was a sad installment. All the characters looked alike and you couldn't tell them apart. They had no personal growth or development to make the viewer feel bad when they finally got sliced and diced. Some of the deaths were lame. The 3-D wasn't even that good with the cheap pair of red and blue plastic 3-D glasses that come in the case. I wanted to stab myself after watching this movie because I wasted $25 bucks on it. It went into the declined movie collection in my deep dark basement where it belongs and I'm sad it's not sitting with the other 3 on my shelve. Overall, avoid this mess."
1,"if You Like Terrible Movies, Guess","Positive:A few seconds of Terminator type x-ray views of skeletons.Negatives:(1.) Poor CG mutilation effects such as when a compressed air container goes through someone the CG hole is so fake it's laughable.(2.) No (not just poor, but NO) acting as one could reasonably define the idea.(3.) Desperate for money producers are retelling the same story over and over and over and over again.(4.) For those who haven't seen the previous retellings of the ""foresee catastrophes and try to stop them before they stop you"" storyline - yawn - there were so many holes in the story that any audience not familiar would be so lost they couldn't even escape from a large paper bag or some similar metaphor. Even if you have seen this storyline before you would find this movie so jumbled (aka edited) in order to create cheap effects that really all they created was confusion.(5.) A little little bit of fake sex to attract some demographic."
2,FINAL DESTINATION 3D Blu Ray,"Most of us agree that this was not the best of the Final Destination movies..It was a re hash of the same plot & Just some more blood & guts splashed over your face. this Blu Ray disc contains both the 2D & 3D versions with 2 pairs of the cheap quality glasses (wonder when we will get superior quality glasses with the superior quality Blu Ray movies??..Hopefully 'Avatar' 3D Bluray will bring that)This disc contains several deleted scenes & you will be thankfull they were deleted. & also the usual alternate endings. Digital copy of the movie, BD Live & an Exclusive first look at the new 'Nightmare on elm street' movie that is scheduled to hit screens around April 2010.However on the plus side the picture & sound quality are good. So if you enjoy watching Blood & Body parts being thrown at you..this one is for you!!"
3,THE 3D MADE IT WORTHWHILE,"Had anyone told me that I would've liked any of the Final Destination movies since maybe the 2nd one I would've told them they were nuts....predictable..i.e everyone must die,etc,etc. But because I am a fan of 3D,and I thought the 3D scenes were good,I actually enjoyed this one.I am puzzeled that some of you said that yours came with 3d glasses or that it didn't work on your 3d set.Did you purchase the blu ray version ?? I thought everything flying out of the screen made it fun,even if it was predictably violent."
3,A GOOD JOKE,"This movie is just a big joke, but a good one indeed ! The cast is not so bad ( Shawa is betten than in the mean ""IDDLE HANDS "") . Why worry about Freddy Kruerger, Jason or Michael Mayers, when the worst enemy of all, Death Herself, is coming after the teenagers ? It's a good premise. Unfortunately, the ending was absurdly conceived to let the doors open for a probable sequel ..."
5,soup1978@yahoo.com,"to me, this was the best movie out of all the series. this is a jaw dropping,eyes shuting,crazy,bug out movie. if you like crazy,suspense movies this movie is for you."
2,"Not too bad, but...","..Final Destination is a film, with teens yet again, falling under the knife ('scuse the pun). Even that fact ruined it for me, always bloody teenagers getting murdered! The only thing that saves this film is the twists and the fact there is no serial killer just fate/death pure and simple, which works well, but how many more 'Scream, teeny-bop slashers' are they going to make? It gets boring. And as for this film being a make-u-jump kind of film - what the hell? Ghostbusters made me jump out of my skin more than this overrated movie. One of it's better moments comes when we meet good 'ol Candy man Tony Todd as a coroner. However with this film, don't expect too much."
1,Final Destination: Bad MovieLand,"What never ceases to amaze me was that people criticized Ed Wood for years. I mean, yeah he did use pie pans for flying saucers, but this joker actually paid tons of money for his special effects. I will say this though, great acting job done by the local high school drama club-----NOT!!! I think they could have done us and their careers a favor and stayed on the airplane and died. From the desk of joe-blow Hollywood agent: Note to myself: Send young actors and actresses to acting class."
3,"Hopefully the ""final"" Final Destination","Probably the weakest of the series, but watchable. The kills weren't as creative as its predecessors. Time to retire this series!"
3,Final Destination on Blu Ray,I have all the Final Destinations on Standard DVD except for this one on Blu Ray with a digital copy and can be viewed on 2D o 3D with glasses & wasn't a bad show where in some scenes everything just goes wrong with a Clearer picture & sound ... Three and Half Out of Five .
3,"Good, but certainly flawed","A group of teens are kicked off a flight when one of them (Devon Sawa) has a vision of the plane exploding in mid-air. The vision comes true, and death itself begins to hunt down the survivors. One of the smartest and most entertaining of post-Scream thrillers, this one moves at a brisk pace with an intriguing premise and a lot of surprisingly involving dialogue. A bit too silly and contradictory at times, but the death scenes are gruesome and imaginative, and yes, the final scene is a scream. Good performances from Devon Sawa and Ali Larter and Seann William Scott is hilarious as the sympathetic loser.*** 1/2 out of *****"
3,Sneaky little death,"I loved the first two installments of The final destination movies. Possibly because when those came out I was a very young adult and more related to the actors maybe. I don't know but that's my theory. Also the first two movies seemed more plausible. Maybe. In the first movies death didn't ""play"" with you as much.They were simple and to the point. Now death seems to take it's time. It's like all your actions no matter how insignificant they are death will use them to work against you to kill you. Killing you in a weird, freakish way. Also the special effects looked very fake and cheesy. Overall , I still had fun watching it but I'll stick to the first two."
3,Picture this...,"...water is moving, of its own volition, towards you, creating a slick surface that will cause you to slip and hang yourself in the shower. Having gotten that out of the way, I have to say that this movie was nowhere as bad as I thought it would be. In fact, it was pretty amusing. Interesting premise, but the ending was bad. Not funny bad. Just bad. Oh, and Ryan, if you're reading this, you can just DROP DEAD!"
3,pretty good horror flick,"This was a pretty good horror flick. It wasn't as good as Scream or Scream 2 but has some pretty good gore. The plot is good. It was a bit confusing but you get it after a while. The end leaves the viewer with suspense, waiting for a sequel. I suggest renting it and seeing how you like it, and then buying it. You should rent this movie if you like horror flicks. Devon Sawa and Ali Larter are also great actors who leave the viewer wanting more. Rent this movie."
3,Intended for a Juvenile Audience,"Even though this movie is rated ""R"" it seems to me that the intended audience for this film was teenagers. The events in the film happen to high school seniors. The plot which could have been developed into an interesting story is juvenile and when things in the movie starting getting a little intense they are alleviated with slapstick humor.All of this does not make this a bad video, just not one that is intellectually stimulating. If some of the graphic violence was edited out of the film it probably could have gotten a ""PG-13"" rating and been legally viewed by the directors intended audience."
1,Final Destination 4 Review,"While still as bloody & gorey as ever before,its still just the same stuff you saw in the other F.D. films. Like Jurassic Park 2,its just filler until death comes. Like Jaws 3D,The 3D doesn't really work in there and gets really annoying after awhile. This film has more recurring cliche characters then a Stephen King mini-series. This movie also has the most over-the-rope & silliest deaths this side of The Tommyknockers. Overall,Its just the same stuff you saw in the first 3 films again & again. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
3,reliable seller,Product arrived on time and in condition stated. Although the movie was not as good as I expected I can not say anything wrong about the seller. I reccomend purchasing from this seller if they have what you are looking for. Items ship fast and in condition stated.
5,LOVE IT,Nadia Monroy is my fave i just loved her even though she only got 11 mins she was still awesome and i loved the movie u should buy the DVD
5,THE FINAL DESTINATION,"I HAVE THE COLLECTION OF THIS MOVIE, I THINKS IT'S GREAT. I HOPE THEY MAKE MORE OF THE SERIES. I RECOMMENDED IT TO ALL VIEWERS."
3,"Hoping this is the final one in ""The Final Destination"" series","This was an ok film but the least fun and weakest of all the FD films. The x-ray opening and closing of the film was entertaining. The opening; showing the scenes in x-ray sequence of all four of the films is very clever and enjoyable. The opening sequence at the race track was good but using autos have been done before, FD2. Starting with FD3 and continuing even more with FD4; the characters are getting to be more and more nothing but brief card board cut outs and you care less and less about them.I did not get to see this one in the theatres in 3D but the 3D here was the best that I have had in a dvd package. My suggestion is to see it in both 2 and 3D.It is a very short film, 87 minutes.I am glad I purchased this to complete my FD collection. Just hope that now the collection is complete for good."
2,Bloody and Gory and Messy...,"When you prepare yourself to watch ""The Final Destination,"" popping popcorn and pouring your soft drink, you should also prepare for one other thing: predictability. This movie is formulaic, the script isn't very good, and the gore is elevated to extremely high levels. I can honestly say that I found myself laughing at both the dialogue and insane amounts of gore (you have to see certain scenes to believe them, and even then they don't make much sense). This is a fun movie, but not an Oscar-worthy one.If you want over the top bloody, gory fun, then this movie is fine. Don't expect the script to be anything but messy, and don't expect spectacular cinematography. It looks great on Blu-ray (but the 3-D scenes obviously don't have the same type of impact that they would have in theaters).Overall, an interesting part of the series, but it could use a serious overhaul to prevent it from being another ""Saw."""
1,Good grief!!,First of all I have been a fan of all of the Final Destination films. I was excited when this one was available on blu-ray. I popped it in my blu-ray player and within 30 minutes I was thinking about shutting it off. It was so fake and the special effects looked just ridiculous.I would only recommend this movie if you have money to burn.
1,the final destination-bad,"I was excited about seeing the last installation of this series, but i was badly let down. Although the third wasn't the greatest, it was good enough to watch again. In this movie i could barely pay attention, and almost fell asleep! TThe story line was the same ole same ole, death is coming for you, but the actors were not as personal or as good as they were in the first 3. If i were you, i would read about it and let it go, it wasn't worth the few dollars i paid for, and i know i won't be watching it again! A big disapointment!"
1,Horrible final film for the series,"This film was not done well in any way. THere was no real creative and new death scenes...and the ones they had did not shock you like it had in the past films. The actors sucked in this film really bad. There was no mention about any of the previous people in the other films, it only mentioned about premotions, signs, and stuff llike that but nothing specific like they had in the other films. Not even worth wasting your time watching on HBO. Would not recoomend to anyone to watch and will for sure not add it to mu collection of the other 3 films."
2,Really? Nah...we couldn't be so lucky,"As in all the previous Final Destination films, a group of characters escape death after one of them experiences a premonition of a terrible disaster. They spend the rest of the movie in a futile attempt to escape their fate. I thought the first three movies were okay if you have a hankering for gory mayhem, but this one was so bad that I found myself thinking up my own horror franchise: a group of characters find themselves trapped in a film written by a lazy screenwriter and spend the rest of the movie in a futile attempt to escape their fate. Fortunately, your attempts need not be futile: push EJECT."
2,Final Destination,"This is a gore fest. No plot, silly and chaotic. I really had a hard time sitting through this movie."
2,Worst In The Series,So sad to see what happened to this series.The early Final Destination movies were good but this one is so bad.I heard that there is going to be anthor one after this one.Let's hope it doesn't get any worse than this.
1,Hopefully the last movie in the series,"I enjoyed watching the first movie in the series and a few scenes in the second but the franchise has run out of ideas. The fourth installment was released in 3D and may have offered some genuine scary moments in the theater. If you like people dying and cut up in to pieces, then this is the movie to watch. I did not enjoy this at all. I want my money back.....One star01/21/10"
2,"for me,it sure is","but i doubt this will be the final installment.these things are so cheap to make,what with their no name actors.maybe i'm just getting old,but i found myself bored out of my skull with this thing.i guess maybe i'm just not all that entertained by people dying in gross,disgusting ways anymore.that and i just found it all too absurd.not too mention the story is old hat.at slightly less than ninety minutes,this thing is slightly less than ninety minutes too long,in my opinion.for the fourteen to mid twenty crowd,i guess this might hold some value,and yes,it would have for me,at that age,and even beyond.until recently in fact.it's only been maybe three years since i realized i wanted more from my movie experience.one thing's for sure,when the next installment comes around,that's one destination i won't be going on.for me,The Final Destination is a 2/5"
1,"Final, sounds good to me.","Failed to bring anything new to the series and it all ended disappointingly with the no one surviving. Big surprise.Computer graphics were very poor and death scenes were a joke.By the end I got tired of seeing people getting run over by cars or getting objects hurled into them. Death kills people in such a long, thought-out, by-chance way that it just becomes a joke. Death can move objects freely and also stop electronic devices from working, seems a bit too much to me."
3,The destination was final.,"and so was the movie. ""We know we are going to die."" ... one of the memorable lines.Far over hyped. I sometimes wonder if these movies are actually conceived to have their 3 seconds of movie theators and then go to die on the webstores like Amazon."
2,The Final Destination? God I hope!,"I am so glad I only spent one dollar at REDBOX to rent this crap. It has nothing to do with the characters of the previous films, and making it 3D is some marketing ploy to sell this total trash. Ridiculous ""freak"" accidents that made me laugh out loud! Gee so many places of business in this movie that are so dangerous and accident-prone. Maybe OSHA should be called? If you watch this, then I suggest just to fast forward to all the accidents. Better yet just rent it for $1 at REDBOX. Too bad I can't get my dollar back."
3,Bad movie.. Cool 3D,"The final destination movies are getting worst with each sequel that they make. Part 4 the only thing good on it, is that it is in 3D witch is not the best 3D I've seen but even so, is the best way to see this movie.The caracters are forgetable, bad actors, the plot is the same, and the special effects are.... crap.When watching a final destination movie and you reach to part 4, you feel is the same movie only with a diferent cenario.Even though, it's a must boy for fans of the franchise and 3D fans. Not all the movie works, but the parts that work are really cool."
5,the final destination,This movie was excellent to me. Had me on the edge of the couch the whole time. Makes you wonder when you have a close call with life. A definite thriller movie. A must see. I have the whole collection. This one is exceptionally gorey. Lots of blood. I loved it.
3,OUCH...3D is BS!!!!!,"Saw this in the theater and the 3D BLEW me away!!! The premise of the movie is the same old same old and isn't real great but the 3D in the theater made it a blast!Got this dvd out last night and was immediatley turned off when I looked at the 3D glasses and realized they were Red and Blue. Old school crap!The 3D on My bloody Valentine was top notch and awesome for home viewing. The glasses were green and magenta and it worked really well. The red n blue for Final Destination 4 is crap. The left eye which is red totally takes over the blue side and gave me a headache within seconds. The 3D wasn't that breathtaking AT ALL like in the theater.And I have a 1080P 52"" and it still looked like $h1T!!!!If you want a great HOME 3d movie experience than watch My Bloody Valentine 3D."
4,The Final Destination (Blu-ray 3D),"Received right away. I had already seen the 2D movie, but my new Dell Laptop has 3D 1080P LED 17.3"" screen with Truelife & Nvidia GeForce card so I purchased my first 3D movie. It is a good movie and 3D will blow you away."
3,3d ????,"It is still hard to watch 3d outside of a movie theater, but this is a close 2nd after you get used to it..worth it to update my dvd collection to the next level."
1,No thanks.,"I gave this one a try, the 3D was all it had to offer, in my opinion. Just so predictable overall."
4,"I don't have a favorite...., yet","Although this entry is the shortest, that's not a problem for me. The real issue is at least two survivors are impossible to like, so the director kills them off rather quickly-what's the complaint, I don't have one, ha!First, there was the plane explosion, then there was the pile-up, followed by a roller-coaster disaster, now we have a race car track catastrophe. My biggest question is, what can they do next? The answer, alot! I don't want this franchise to end just yet. The critics totally missed the point of this series, it was far more original than any 'slasher film' I've ever seen, and I've seen my share of good and bad. My attitude with this series is: you aren't dealing with a knife-carrying psycho just out to kill people, with this series, you have more to work with, so please, a message to the creators, don't stop here!"
4,Better that most teen horror movies.,"This movie is not the kind of horror movie like Scream. In Scream, a mad killer causes the horror. In Final Destination, it is more supernatural. The characters have to fight against Death himself. You often get to know who's in danger in this movie, but you don't know what is going to happen to him or her, so it doesn't ruin anything. It just makes it even scarier and you're really sitting at the edge of the chair.This movie is good. Most of the acting is average, like most other teen movies, but the story is better in this movie. I very much recommend it to everybody who likes horror movies or thrillers. I guess many X-Files fans will like it too. On the DVD, there is an alternate ending and the director's comments to the entire movie."
4,Blood Splattering Fest in 3D,"There aren`t many 3D movies out there and just like Piranha.There is quite a blood fest in this one .They took surprise element of death away by showing vision even before the creative way death takes place to claim a body .If director had avoided that it could be great suspense.May be they don`t want to categorize themselves as horror genera.So visions were there.Story wise actually there is none what so ever,Bunch of people saved in accident and now death following them but 3D wise especially ""LAST 20 MINUTES "" don`t miss them.Its where movies really takes off in 3D .There are many Out of screen and blood gushing effects throughout the movie.if you want to chose one out of two final destination movies in 3D .i prefer Final destination5 3D over this one.Story 2/53D 4.5/5"
5,Magnificent indie classic!!!,"The debut album from Aussie indie rockers is one of the 1990's very best.Every single song from start to finish is superb, thoroughly enjoyable!I really love Suzie's vocals/lyrics and the guys play brilliantly together.Highlights can be subjective but ""You're In A Mess"" is a triumphant joy.The band would consolidate with their next albums but this is my favourite.So, I highly recommend any true music to grab a copy now, get in..."
5,Finally I got this on CD,"Since many years ago, when the review of this LP appears in Rolling Stone Magazine, I got the tape, and I really liked. Finally, I got it on CD, I recommend a lot this LP, it have a new music proposal something fresh, something unique."
3,Havana 3AM - a taste of things to come...,"I seem to be in the minorty here. I think this album is good (how could a line-up featuring ex-Clash and ex-Whirlwind members not be good?) - but... the following Havana 3AM is stacks better in my opinion. Even though Dixon (RIP) is not on there, and Simonon is not featured (and as much as I love The Clash), Gary Myrick takes the sound much more in the direction of Rockabilly/Americana and develops something very special with his own brand of Texas Twang. The album is called 'Texas Glitter & Tombstone Tales'. If you like the first Havana 3AM album, then search this one out. If you didn't get along with the debut, then you might be in for a very pleasant surpise with the second."
1,Bands that use Habana.,"CollectorI was given 'Havana 3:AM' for a gift. The giver had no idea of the broad extense of the Cuban music experience. The music of this group, though fine for some others is trash for me, when enjoying dance or brandy and and a great puro when listening,All I see is some other persons music going down the road, like a clanging junkcart with; a HABANA sign on the back trying to bait more audience FOR NO GOOD REASON. Many Thanks.Guild GAD 30REASB:"
3,mp3 problems,"I purchased a VN3100-PC a few weeks ago specifically to download music files from my singing group while on vacation. AFTER i opened the plastic carton and read the manual, i found it was NOT made to download music files from a PC (despite the PC in the model #). I then bought a WS300M at the advise of customer support and downloaded some files from my group that were sent in MP3 format. When i tried to play them, i got an ""illegal file"" message that i could not get around. There was NO mention of this error message in any part of the manual that i could find, but i now see a lot of comments of the same nature in here. The recorder has great sound, but i am still trying to figure out how to play my music files. I find it amusing that my $19.00 mp3 player plays these files but the $79.00 Olympus wont (at least yet)."
3,Good stuff,"So far, it's been a good recorder and mp3 player. But I met a problem 3 times and I had to format the disk to be able to record again. I don't how it happens, but after recording for a while, I received the blinking message ""on standby"" and from then, It is impossible to record."
1,Very bad product - avoid at all costs,"Before considering to purchase this recorder, please do a search for the model number on google: OLYMPUS WS-300M. You will find that many many people have ""memory error"" malfunctions the moment they change the battery for the first time. From this point on the product no longer works (ever). The manual says that this error message indicates that the unit needs to be returned to OLYMPUS as it is an internal memory error.It is very light and compact, but the battery disconnects from the main unit when you use the USB port meaning that you may need to reset the date and time.Maybe you can return it when it malfunctions, but you know what a hassle it is to deal with returning anything purchased on the internet.This product is not worth the hassle. Mine worked for abou 20 minutes and never again. I spent USD80 and it was money out the window. I am sure Panasonic or Sony make less nice looking but more reliable products.Good Luck !!!"
5,Really Good System,"I bought the WS-300M recorder, Olympus Stereo mic, 300M case and am using rechargeable battery and a $15 Radioshack stereo earphone. All work great together. Am very pleased."
1,Expensive junk,"I bought this recorder about 2 years ago when I switched to digital format. The recorder is used for my business, but not abused. It was always carried in a case and inside my hard shell briefcase. About 3 months ago the HOLD switch stopped working but I continued using the recorder by removing and replacing the battery so it would not run down. Oh, it would automatically turn off and then... mysteriously turn itself back on until the battery was dead. Today I took a recorded statement and, although it was on the recorder (it played back)it would not download to my CPU. Sadly, I bought THIS recorder because I've had such good experiences with Olympus cameras in the past. PS - my co-worker bought another model of this same recorder shortly after I bought mine and it is starting to do similar, goofy, anoying stuff. Pathetic quality.."
4,Haven't used it much.,Good quality and easy to use. Really haven't used it much but it has worked well when I did.
4,Nice Product,"I have been using this recorder for college lectures and found it works really well! It is simple and fast to upload the information onto your computer, which makes saving and accessing files really easy. The clarity of my professors has been great (even manages to pick up my professor who mumbles at the blackboard!). However, you don't want to bump the recorder because it creates quite a noise when you play it back!!The main reason I only gave this 4 stars, is that a few of my files have been corrupted and it even lost one of my files. How I would have loved to have had the audio file of my chemistry professor ""trying out"" my new digital voice recorder by singing opera..lolOverall, a nice recorder; a few bugs but not too bad!!"
4,Nice DVR,I bought this DVR recently and I'm surprised by the quality of recording and It is easy to transfer or play files in my PC. Highly recommended.
4,Olympus WS-300M Digital Voice Recorder and Music Player,"It's a convenient Voice Recorder, easy to use. We use it for my daughters' piano lesson and band practice. The recorded sound with earphone is acceptable. Without earphone, the sound quality could not compare with my 16 years' old analog tape recorder. For music player, it is quite noticeable it does not produce full range of audible sound."
4,great machine,all i could ask for in the recording mode.i would have given it 5 stars if the screen was easier to read
5,This DVR rocks!!!!!,I'm using this to record meetings with fellow employees who dial in on a conference phone. The quality is excellent. Even the guy you can barely hear normally comes thru clear as a bell. Great shipping too!
3,my experience with ws-300M 256M DVR,"I use this recorder to record my business classes. comparing to my classmates' average mp3+ voice recorder, I don't think there is an obvious difference of voice quality. but WS-300M is much more expensive than the average ones.as someone already said, the battery warning signal is not accurate. sometime the recorder looks in half-battery state, but it soon ran out of battery."
1,Not a reliable recorder,"Having purchased several of the Olympus WS-100 voice recorders with no problems, I was extremely disappointed with the problems I had with the WS300M. I purchased this newer model because it had more storage capacity, but unfortunately have had problems with some of them failing to operate after a month or so of use. Out of 8 purchased for law enforcement officers to carry in the field to record interviews, we had to throw away 2 (with crucial evidence nearly being lost in the process). Just not good enough!!! I'm going back to the WS-100 and if I have any more problems will look to another manufacturer entirely."
3,Digital voice recorder,"It works well, but it's a pain to rewind when I'm transcribing (I need to get the foot pedal system for it). I've found it's easier to just play it so it records onto a mini-cassette and then use my dictaphone to transcribe the mini-cassette. But for size and ease of use otherwise, it's good."
4,Does The Job,"I picked this up for recording sessions at school. The first try was pretty bad. One of my instructors has a pretty quiet voice. It was lost under all the ambient sounds of the class.I picked up an inexpensive mic and put the recorder on the front desk. Now I get really decent recordings and the ambient sound is much reduced.I love the compact size and the ease of transferring the files to my computer. The batteries last an acceptable length of time, but do pack extras if you are doing something similar to me. Recording 15 hours of lecture over a weekend."
1,It is giving memory error,"I bought this on Sep 27th and hardly used it. Now giving memory error. When I insert into the PC it is asking for format, when I select Yes, it says write protected. Since I bought it from amazon.com not able to exchange it. Had I bought it in BestBuy I would have exchanged it. I am feeling bad."
4,"great size, good recording, software just ok","Very small, very functional. Would like more flexibility in the software (other models allow me to rename folders; the DSS lite player is limited; the interface is not terribly intuitive. I would buy again, just because the limitations don't override the size/recording quality/cost factors."
2,"Good sound, but marred by poor battery life","The sound quality on this device is very good. I purchased for my wife to use in her voice lessons, and it lives up to the high audio standards required by this situation.However - - the battery lasts no more than 2 hours, and when put on standby for a weeks time, the battery seems to drain and it suddenly runs out of juice with no warning!! I use rechargeable batteries, but it is way too much of a pain to be constantly swapping out batteries and re-charging. Definitely would NOT have purchased the product if I had known.Also, our first unit was DEAD after 4 MONTHS! Replaced under warranty but coupled with the short battery life, I do not have a good impression of the product. Look elsewhere."
4,Good buy,"This product was a very good buy, and the sound quality was wonderful. It was very easy to retreive information to my laptop."
4,Fun little gadget,"This item was purchased for recording digital sound clips that I wanted to upload to computer programs I am designing for my special needs child. It has worked well for that purpose. My main dislike, was a rather loud click that became part of the recording and it occurs as the record button is pressed (or maybe it was the stop button). Thankfully I had gotten the microphone with the recorder; which eliminates the irritating sound. Recordings are much cleaner sounding with the microphone. We found an unexpected use for the recorder as well. I had been able to go to Librivox and download public domain audio book readings. I added the files to this little gadget and my daughter was able to listen to 49 chapters of Black Beauty for entertainment during some recent traveling. We liked it well enough, that we purchased a second one."
4,What happened to the price on the ws300?,I love this product and have been using it for a year now but what happened to the price. I bought mine last year for around $80 and now the price listed is $199?? That is quite a shocking increase?
4,NICE LITTLE RECORDER,"Nice little recorder. It is easy to operate and very user friendly. Only needs one AAA battery and it lasts quite long. I didn't give it 5 stars because of this:If you already own an mp3 player with the ability to record, you may not need this gadget. Granted quality is a bit better, but if you are not gonna user it often, your mp3 player will do just fine."
3,Lots of Memory - Not Great for Music,The price is right and the capacity is great but I have a hard time recording music without the amplitude maxing out. I use Nero Wave Editor and when ever I transfer recorded music to my PC via the USB port the amplitude maxes out about 90% of the time. I ended up connecting the earphone output of the recorder to the mic input on my lap top and then I was able to adjust the microphone volume to keep the amplitudes well within the limits.
5,A Best Buy!,"You can't miss with this great, little digital recorder. I've tried other, less expensive brands and all of them were noisy and more difficult to use. This is without question the best buy."
5,very impressed,"This is a very good recorder which I use for college lectures. The sound quality is great and I have had no problems with distorted sound, muffled speech so on. The earphones come in very handy as I can listen to lectures while commuting. I haven't yet downloaded because it has a ton of memory. I would invest in lots of batteries, though. I would say after a 2 hour lecture and then listening 2 or 3 times the battery is done. Very happy with purchase."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,Was looking for very compact digital recorder that could record many hours without draining battery. This is it! Couldn't be happier.
3,Disappointing Sound,"I love this little voice recorder for many reasons, but no matter what I do, including purchasing a special stereo microphone and recording in the highest quality stereo mode, I can't get any reasonable volume out of it. I had hoped that the problem was in its small speaker, but I experience the same weak volume even when I transfer the material to my pc and turn up the speakers. A second related problem is that there is always a slight hissing in the background. I though I'd lose this annoyance by going from tape to digital, but not so. As a result, recording night sounds (peepers, tree frogs, crickets and other insects) is hugely disappointing.Unless I bought a defective unit, I'd say that all the wonderful features are wasted because, at the end of the day, you can barely hear what you've recorded."
3,Digital Voice Recorder,"I use this recorder for my small business. I heavily rely on it picking up remote conversations. Then, I have to be able to plug it in any compatible computer's USB for download, and then upload to my email message. Unfortunately, for the past several weeks now, I have to prop it up in a specific position or it will not engage. I have a laptop and three desktop computers and it will only work in one desktop and does not work in the laptop. The recorder works perfectly to pick up distant conversations and dictation. I do not use the music at this time. I am in the process of returning it for exchange."
4,POWER SWITCH,POWER SWITCH EASILY OR ACCIDENTLY SHUT OFF OR TURNED ON. COMPACT AND EASY TO USE.ALL ELSE OK AND EZ TO USE.
4,Good value,"My first digital voice recorder. Based on reviews here and elsewhere, I bought it to keep a travel journal, and I've been very pleased with it. It's still on the original battery from late December. Guess I haven't quite reached the 15 hours of taping they promise per battery.Pros; Compact,lightweight and quite good battery life and sound pick-up.Cons: Creating a new file number every time you turn it on seems like a convoluted way of indexing. But it's better than no indexing."
3,Convenient,"I like having it, but it's difficult to see the features, and a little more complicated to operate than I expected after reading other rave reviews."
1,Unease of operation,We received the recorder promptly but have been unable to understand how it operates from the instructions provided. Those instructions that were provided are in such small print it has been difficult to read without getting lost. We have not been able to get it to work and plan shortly to call the manufacturer for assistance.
3,It is ok,I was disappointed that I cannot plug into the wall and only uses batteries. So I gave to my wife for her school lectures.
2,Can't hear playback without headphones,"Had I known it was almost impossible to hear playback without headphones, I would never have bought this unit. With headphones, quality is good. To use as a handheld with playback, it's useless."
2,"if attracted to ""and music player"" aspect, don't be fooled","I'm guessing I should have known better - that 256 MB would not allow me to store that many songs, but I was hoping for more than 50 songs. I went in search of a recorder for the ""voice recording"" aspect first and foremost, which works very well in this recorder. I decided on this one versus others, however, because it had the ""and music player"" option. However, since the extent to which that is true, I would have been MUCH better off just purchasing a cheaper digital voice recorder or spending a little more to actually get the voice and music options. Just be forewarned if you're excited by the capability of playing music if you would like more than 50 songs available at a time."
3,Good but not over time,"There's a lot to be said about this product. I found that the recording quality was very good. Yes, it is sensitive to handling noises, but once you are aware of that, you can be careful. However, first negative: it chews up batteries like candy. Now that I have had it for about 2 1/2 years, it can go through a battery in a day, easy. And lately, it has stopped working consistently. Something has gone wrong with this once wonderful little machine, and it is now very unreliable. So, you may need to keep that in your head: It will work for about 2.5 years.An additional plus is that it can function as an MP3 player, although I didn't use it for that purpose very often. It was a business tool...and that has to be reliable."
3,problem with rewind?,"I'm trying to rewind just a few seconds on taped interviews (for transcription), but every time it automatically rewinds to the start. Ideas? thx"
3,Does What It Is Supposed To,"Although this little recorder does a great job of recording voices, it is somewhat awkward to use with the side buttons. And it is very overpriced in this day of falling electronics prices. Amazon's price is the best anywhere, as it ususally is, but even that price is high."
2,Olympus WS-300MNot so great,"I found the device too small, and the ability of the mike to pick up sounds when you are handling it is poor. I also found the way the USB connector works--disconnecting the battery pack--kind of bizzarre and somewhat quirky. The device seems flimsily made, and although it was fine in a quiet room, I found it difficult to use in noisier venues--i.e., the car. Also, storing things as WMA files is pretty silly when you can use more widely accepted file formats. This made it impractical for me to use easliy with my mac."
4,excelllent,very nice camera. it give professional photography even by naive person like me. sony is really good in digicam. it would be better if accessary kit provided along camera should of sony brand rather than local brand. accessary kits were disappointing me.camera is good. again the lens hood is of local made (not sony).
5,No doubt,"There's no doubt that this product is great and simple to use. Batteries don't last as much as instructions say (16 hours), they last like 4; maybe the batteries I've used are not that good, that's why I give it 5 stars."
5,Big product in a small package,I have been very impressed with the sound quality and the capabilities of this digital recorder. Sensitive mic and direct USB plug in makes this a very versatile personal recorder. Best of all it is very small and light. Great for lectures and meetings.
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent product, I use it to record my classes and it works very nice, It can record many hours depending on how you configure it. What I really recommend is that you have to use rechargable batteries because regular batteries won't last more than 7 hours non stop.It is very small and easy to operate. After you are done with the recording just plug it in into your computer and that's it."
3,I loved this lemon.,"I must say that I initially loved the Olympus WS-300M. It's lightweight, recordings sound excellent and the convenience of having the lower part of the device detach from the upper part so that it can be plugged directly into a USB port and recordings can be transferred to computer is pure genius. I take very good care of all my electronics...in fact some might say I baby them because I like them to work for a long time. I bought this one from Amazon on August 2, 2007 and this morning October 2, 2007 I got the message ""Memory Error."" In the troubleshooting section of my owners manual it gives info about the ""Memory Error."" It says, ""This is a Malfunction, so go to the store where you purchased the recorder or an Olympus Service Station for repair."" Was I sold a lemon? Eithere way, there goes $73.00 down the drain."
1,Stopped working after 4 months of use,"The product is nice, but after 4 months of use, it just stopped working - a cascade of events from ""format error"" to ""memory error"" and now it doesn't even turn on. Be sure to keep your receipt in case you need to use the manufacturers 1-year warranty!"
5,Very professional sound! great service from amazon,"I ordered my first Olympus WS-300M DVR in October 07 and it arrived in 3 days. I recorded a few consultations and then, I am not sure if it was my fault or the DVR, but it fizzled out after a few tries (less than 30 days). I called Olympus and found that I could send it directly to them but it wouldn't be repaired for a month or so. Then I emailed Amazon and talked with a LIVE person and explained my problem--less than 30 days use etc. and they promptly SENT ME A BRAND NEW RECORDER! All I had to do was box it up w/ all the cords and manual that it came with. (I didn't have the indestructible plastic it came with, so I bubble-wrapped it.)I couldn't be more pleased with this DVR, the sound is so-o-o-o good and the service of talking to a LIVE person and getting the new DVR in 3 days made me a believer! I even demo the sound to my new clients--they love it."
4,DVR-could come with more logical instructions,"This is a great product. I use it to tape lectures at school and it records very well.My only complaint, as with all tech products, is that the instructions arent easy to follow if they even include instructions for the product purchased. How many times have you read the instructions to find out that they pertain to various models, not just the one that you are trying to figure out?Took me a while to figure it out, and I am still trying to figure out why the recording sometimes stays on the recorder, after I copy it to my computer, and sometimes it just completely goes over to the computer without keeping a copy on the unit."
5,The book is great and so are the cookies!,This is one of my little sister's favorite childhood books - and the included cookie recipe has become a family favorite!
4,cute book,We read this in our homeschool as a fiction read aloud. My son who is seven enjoyed hearing the book. He liked hearing about the scouts adventures. I'm sure we will be reading more Pee Wee Scout books soon.
5,MRS. PETER'S IS REALLY FUNNY.,I ESPECIALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. MRS. PETER'S EXPLAINED HOW TO MAKE THE COOKIES IN A FUNNY WAY. I AM A 3RD GRADER AND BELIEVE THAT I WILL REALLY ENJOY READING MORE OF PEE WEE SCOUTS!
4,Another Great Book By Pink!,"Like most of what A.W. Pink wrote, this book is an excellent addition to anyone's library. In this thorough book, he devotes a chapter for each commandment, the whole time presenting each one in a way that is relevant to us. And, as an added ""bonus"" there is a chapter entitled ""A Word To Parents."" Parents need to teach their children the Ten Commandments as found in God's Word. It would help them to be better children, and they will grow up to be respectable citizens. Buy a copy for yourself and another copy to give away! You will not regret it! (I intended on giving this book 5 stars, but somehow it only shows 4...)"
4,The 10 Commandments: Do They Apply for Today?,"Many are preaching an antinomian (against law) theology that is destroying the church today. A. W. Pink shows us in light of Scripture that we as Christians are to live by and teach others as well the 10 Commandments. ""For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."" (Matthew 5:18-19)"
4,So bad it's good.,"Have always loved this one, since only having it in a murky, laser-disc-transfered edition. Not much to recommend this if you want quality, but if you're like me, enjoy the atrocious acting, extreme violence (love that motor-kill), and the cool 80's synth score (had a time finding that on c.d.!). Sort of a must for us Zombie-thriller lovers."
5,Great movie!,"This is a great example of the early 80s Euro-gore movies. I saw it at the drive-in when it came out, and then ob VHS as Dr Butcher MD. There is a lot of grain in the movie, especially in the darker scenes, which is typical of movies shot on film. I think this enhances the viewing experience. Down with digital and CGI, this is what a horror movie should look like."
4,A Classic,"Though I expected Zombie's running around in a big city, I still found this movie to be pretty good. The gore in this movie is quite good. The film kept me in suspence, while the acting is average. But, what would you expect from a 1980's horror zombie flick? This is a sure bet for your DVD collection. I simply enjoy this movie everytime I watch it."
3,a reworked Zombie 2,Honestly I believe that this is just a reworked script of Zombie 2. No joke. Same actors at times and scenes and areas and it's just sad.
2,Misleading,"This is a very misleading name.There is no ""holocaust"" of zombies, unless you consider a group of 4 shuffling zombies a holocaust.This move should be called Cannical Holocaust...With Zombies, because that is exactly what it is. Although Cannibal Holocaust isn't a grand movie, it is still actually better than this title, which is attempting to rip it off in a way.Back in the late 70's/early 80's, zombie films and cannibal films were making big money. Zombie Holocaust is a lame attempt to cash in on BOTH genres at the same time by throwing zombies in what is basically a cannibal/mondo movie.But the most important fact here: this movie just isn't that great. It is boring, with bad acting, bad zombies, silly tribal cannibals and people somehow managing to get eaten by cannibals who barely comprehend something as complicated as the wheel.Your money would be better spend elsewhere"
3,worth seeing,"This is your bsaci italian Zombie film with a cannibaL twist. worht checking out for any cannibal, zombie, or Itaian horror fan"
3,3 1/2 STARS / A CLASSIC GOREY CHEESEFEST !,"Take Lucio Fulci's ""ZOMBIE 2"",Umberto Lenzi's ""CANNIBAL FEROX"" & an extra large helping of Italian low-budget cheese,blend it all together & you have ""ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST""(AKA Dr.Butcher M.D.) a very fun Italian gore film that borrows alot from the the two classics i named above & still manages to reach its own individual cult status. A must for Italian horror fans!"
4,One more 'hidden' extra,"What can I add that has not already been said about this movie?Everyone knows the 'plot' (and I use that word with some hesitation) and all the DVD technical details.What you may not have noticed is that Shriek Show have provided this splatter classic with a reversable cover.One side the rather tame Zombie Holocaust design, but on the other....the totally over the top Dr Butcher design.I know it's not much, but at least it is another 'extra' to what is already an excellent DVD package.Would have got 5 stars if it included a commentary and a slightly more lively interview with the special effects guy who claims to have forgotten everything about the film apart from the fact it was all shot in Rome - no island in sight. You live and learn!"
2,mediocre italian gore...,"Have we ended world hunger? Do our schoolsand libraries possess the necessary elementsto ensure the education of our young? Andwhat about the elderly? Do they live inthe security of accessible medical care?No?...No?...No? What about you?Do you own all of Fulci's films? all ofArgento's films? all of Bava's films?Until the hungry are fed, the schools arerich, the elderly are safe, and you possessa library of horror DVD's equivalent toa Smithsonian collection, you shouldnot make an effort to own this film.This movie is so blah.But the soundtrack kicks."
4,For Lovers of Ultra Trashy Exploitation Horror Only!,"Looking for in depth characters and plot? Looking for ground breaking filming techniques? Looking for superb soundtrack? DO NOT look here! But if you CRAVE the kind of film that gives youmindless gore, nudity, and shock (i.e. fun fun fun), this is for you! At times we all should turn our brain off and just sit back and enjoy the ride! So many elements here..... Zombies, evil mad doctors, cannibal natives, naked babe, Ian McCoullough, etc. And finally in a restored verson that looks crisp and sharp. From the early 80's when almost anything goes. An awesome party movie for horror fans that have a broad taste for EVERYTHING horror!"
4,Cannibals and some Zombies,"Looking at the cover you and seeing the name of the film and picture of the zombie, you might think this is a zombie film. It is not. You mostly see cannibals and sometimes a few zombies. Who i think mostly looks good, but not all of them. A pretty bloody and gory. I like some of the music in this film like for example that addicting-guitar-porno-esque song you hear when Alexandra Delli Colli undresses. Speaking of she, i think she is sexy and also the lovely Sherry Buchanan.Picture quality: 3.5/5This actually looks better than my old Shriek Show DVD. Improved colours, blood, gore, details and such. This has some trouble with DNR and noise. The DNR makes it look smooth and too clean. Also some scenes was too dark.Audio quality: 3.5/5Yes, some of the music and gunshots effects have bass. Not much else to say, but the English: DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 dual Mono is improved compared to the DVD.Film: 4/5Overall: 4/5"
