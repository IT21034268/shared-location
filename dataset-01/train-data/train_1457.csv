1,Ughh!,In this book i could not even tell what was going on because the author made it clear she had to have mandatory number of sex scenes. There were so many sex scenes i didn't even know what was going on. That man needs to learn to keep his pants zipped up.
2,ponitless sex scenes,i found this book to be o.k. the plot was very interesting and the chemistry between the two lead characters was very well written. however i found the sex scenes between johnnie and the two other women he slept with in the beginning of the book to be utterly pointless and lacking in intimacy. i saw no point in putting them into the story. the ending was a bit rushed but the story between johnnie and elizabeth made up for most of the bad parts of the novel.
4,Action packed romantic story,"The book Outlaw (Carre) was a good read, with an interesting plot, suspense, and romance. It was a little heavy on explicit sex, but the intimate moments between the main male and female characters were appropriate for the main plot. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys action with horses and swords in old Scotland, with hot romance at the center of the story. Overall this book was enjoyable, and kept me reading to the end."
1,sex over story,"Contrary to other readers I don't like being introduced to the hero f-ing many other women, even if the scenes are well written. And not because it's D/s sex, and not because he's cheating on the heroine with a lover that he then passes on to his brother, although the last part is slightly incestuous. Mostly, because it's a real feat to believe later in his miraculous change. First, by the time he meets the heroine he must be already ridden with all possible STDs, second, sex seems to be the most important part of his life, which makes him as a character really shallow and flat (well, maybe not entirely flat). But so is the heroine, who gladly accepts his patronizing attitude in bed - but then, he is an expert."
2,couldn't even finish the book,"With the hero accustomed to so much sex, would a wife really want this much sex all the time even after being married to this hero? This author doesn't seem to address how her heros, who seem to have frequent and indescriminant sex, seem to be able to avoid getting any kind of std's. This is not a compelling love story. Other than their lust for each other, it doesn't describe how they fall in love with each other. All we seem to have is absence makes the heart grow fonder sort of ""love."" I had to stop reading it to find something more substantial. I will eventually finish the book, though."
2,Where's the heat?,"SJ has been criticized for emphasizing creative (and some would say over-the-top) love scenes at the expense of romance. In this case, she seems to have veered too far in the other direction. Outlaw's characters are well-developed. The plot is convincing, fairly suspensful, and bolstered by excellent research- another of Johnson's trademarks. But, while the love scenes didn't lack for sweet, they certainly lacked spice. Also, the ending was unnervingly abrupt. After setting up a complex political intrigue full of legal traps, Johnson unravels it all in just a few pages. I'd love to see Johnson find a happy medium between this and some of her steamier, sexier work."
1,Evil man not of god,Mike Murdock is not a doctor of anything except deceit. He is a shallow man consumed with materialism and the only blessing you will receive from him is an empty wallet.STAY AWAY from anything put out by this lowest of the low -- a man who preys on people's piety and urges to be blessed by God. You will be penniless in no time if you listen to or read the sacrilegous screeds of this purveyor of blasphemic totems.Would rate it zero stars but that is not an option.
1,Definitely a loss of headlight brightness,"I have a 1999 Cougar and bought these to accent my black stripes on my car. I literally just put them on this afternoon and as soon as night fell I went to switch on my HID projection headlights (which are extremely bright) I literally could not see my lights turn on. I had to pull over and pop the covers off to have functionality with my lights. They look good during the day, but that it is."
5,Quality that you can enjoy for hours on end.,"David Degge's hammer dulcimer music is awe inspiring. He plays new age music with a tonal, melodic Renaissance mix that is not only fun to listen to, but incredibly mesmerizing. Not only does he play the hammer dulcimer, but he is also the composer. Even more incredible is that this young performer is still in high school. If you don't own Escape, you must buy it. I've heard David in concert and can assure you that David's playing is quality that you can enjoy for hours on end."
5,my name is ............. evil,this book was a mind twisting story of how maggie is evil but at the end is so wierd the person who is real evil at the end.............. read to find out who it is.
2,My Name is.........Terrible,"Haha, i really did not enjoy this book. I didn't really like the characters, and the plot was so scatterbrained and confusing I didn't really understand what exactly what was going on. I just wanted it to be over."
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE,this one is a keeper. I bought 2 and the lotion.. Very sexy fragrance & my husband loves it!!!!Clarins is famous and quite expensive but worth the money. amazon has the best prices
2,Didn't like it at all,My husband wanted this movie but when I saw what it was about I didn't want to see it and he decided he didn't want to see it either. I believe we returned it.
3,Not a Top,"It is not the best among this-style-Italian-created doco-MUN-taries, but good for a mix of blood, bizzare and nudity to escape from surrounding either in the sixties of the last century or in the third millennium."
3,An unusual movie,"A very odd collection of documentary style clips put togather with little rhyme or reason. Some interesting, many just explotative. The only reason not a one or two star is the wonderful music, especially the melody that eventually became the song ""More"""
4,"You Think Other People's Customs Are Strange, Take A Look At Your Own","Very amusing time capsule of various cultural practices as captured in snapshot views in the early 1960s, delivered in a bemused fashion which now comes across as having a campy and retro appeal. The deft juxtaposition of scenes from Asia, New Guinea, Western Europe and the U.S. is clearly meant to challenge you to recognize that ALL cultures have practices that are bizarre or ridiculous, including the supposedly 'advanced' nations.Due to increased travel and the general level of 'cultural sophistication', most of these depictions will be quite a bit less surprising now than they were at the time of the film's release, but with the heightened awareness of the idea of animal rights in recent years, the scenes of violent animal slaughter will probably be viewed by many as more shocking and politically unacceptable today than they were 45 years ago."
2,Not for the faint of heart,"I saw this movie back in 1967 and was grossed out at the vile things that were done to animals. To this day, it haunts me and gives me a sick feeling to believe that such things actually happen. A distinct memory is of a bull or cow getting its head chopped off, and to see the animal crumple to the ground. There is a sick fascination to the events but once is enough."
1,"MEANINGLESS SHOCK AND GORE, BADLY DIRECTED","I had been curious about this movie for years, so I finally decided to buy a cheap edition. Let me just say at the outset, I was so disgusted physically at certain points that I did almost stop watching. But, I persisted, hoping to find some redeeming qualities in the film. Sadly, there were none to be found. It is pure exploitation of violence and mildly prurient material against a backdrop of badly patched together scenes and no overarching theme.It jumps from subject to subject, and many of the scenes would be laughable if they weren't so maddeningly inferior. The only thing I've seen that gave me a similar feeling to this is clips from the show Bumfights. Being a horror movie fan I don't often sit in judgment on things like this, but in this case I'll make an exception. This will make you ashamed to be human."
2,Sugar coated authenticity,"Again film makers dress entire groups of people in the same attire in an attempt to fake culture. But if you like staged gore and blood, this movie is for you."
2,Missing scenes,This is an abridged edition of a classic exploitation film. In particular the communion scenes from New Guinea are cut which deflates the whole end of the film.
3,STRANGE CUSTOMS FROM HELL AND BEYOND!,"The peoples of other countries do indeed eat the strangest things. Then again, they don't have Pizza Hut like we do. Amusing at times, and hurtful at others, this theatrically released documentary samples the traditions of other cultures via sometimes grotesque video-tapings of said traditions/customs. Not for xeno-phobes! Oddly, this film also introduces us to the song ""More"" , a touching instrumental that's acheived status as a standard. My most memorable segment shows us the effects of nuclear testing near a small island group in the South Pacific: the trace radiation destroys the directional instinct of baby turtles who, after hatching, crawl toward the center of a desert island in search of water. In fact, they should be crawling in the opposite direction. An eye-opening sequence to be sure."
4,Existential Alcoholic saves mankind!,"A good book. I really enjoyed it. I found the story difficult at first but the hero of the story does develop a purpose in chapter 2. The book looks at the global effects of a terrible disease that is slowly wiping out mankind from our hero Paint's unfailingly personal view.One of the most fascinating aspects of the story for me was the flawed nature of the protagonist. I would describe the story arc as ""drunken, chain smoking jerk seeks to rescue mankind"". The story has many genuinely funny scenes driven by his interactions with the people in his life.Not all is what it seems and by the end you will be rethinking scenes from earlier in the story.Enjoy"
2,Not for the serious manga artist,"Get this book if you do not really want to draw manga, but rather want to know how to draw a strange-looking brand new style of comics i call coope-anga. In addition to bad art, this book tells quite a few lies. An example: Coope cliams that colored pencil are a good main source of color. While these are good to start out with, markers are the official media for original colored drawings.However, this book deserves 2 stars instead of 1 because it has some accurate info on hands, feet, body proportions.I highly recommend How To Draw Manga Getting Started over this."
5,wow it rocks!,I got this book in sixth grade and it has healped me so much I can't even begin to describe it.This book is good for beginners.Also its a great referance book too!how to draw more manga coversBODIESHEADSCLOTHINGEYESPOSESFIGHTINGAND EVEN ANIMALS.so if you are beginning to draw manga BUY HOW TO DRAW MORE MANGA it will help a lot (my teacher told me a lot is two words!)
2,Oh boy.,"I'd like to start off, no I don't own any of Ms. Coope's books.In fact, I'd rather not. Judging by the cover alone this book is not good for learning. You can't learn proportions, stylization, anatomy, and other skills from someone who doesn't know these skills themselves.Teenagers are lacking in personal experience in the drawing field because they haven't been around enough to actually experience it.I'm learning and improving on my manga art and this is a book I will NEVER buy.Go buy a Christopher Hart book or a Manga University book."
5,So total worth the $6.99,If this book could have been any more helpful and just plain great it would have been imposible! The pictures all had captions to tell about the picture and used great imagination in naming and illistrating the instructions! I love this book and I would recomend this book to anyone who is interested in drawing manga!!!!
1,A littel confusing,"I bought this item thinking that it was a pack of 3 baseball bats, but upon arrival, I found out it was just one bat and one ball. I didn't see anything about a ball, so I was a little surprised when it came with the ball. I only needed one bat for the project I needed, but I would have never paid that much money for one bat had I known that it was all I was getting, with shipping and everything included. I cannot find a reason why they would put pack of 3 as their title when there was not even 3 things in the package I received.Champion Sports Plastic Bat & Ball Combo - Pack of 3"
2,Not the Large Storm Whistle,"This product is not the Storm Whistle that is pictured, it is the smaller (and not as loud) Wind Storm, so the price is not as good a deal as it appears."
3,Good workbook/reading for beginning clinicians,"As a therapist, I was somewhat disappointed with this workbook and have not used it very much in my practice. Some of the activities are unique and helpful, but most of them require too much preparation or are too advanced for the families I work with. Most of the instructions are very long, and some are confusing. I see clients every hour, so I want something I can pull off the shelf, become familiar with, and prepare in a short amount of time. Most of the handouts that are to be given to clients are printed in small print and hard to read and some use language that is not understandable to clients who have low reading levels. I think this book would be more helpful to new clinicians because it discusses the rationale behind each activity, and includes vignettes that show how the activities helped certain clients, suggestions for follow-up, contraindictions for use, and suggested readings."
4,Great resource for children's mental health practitioners,"This is a wonderful resource for children's mental health practitioners. It includes art and play techniques on a wide variety of treatment issues. Highly recommended.Readers may also be interested in the following books:Creative Interventions for Troubled Children & YouthAssessment and Treatment Activities for Children, Adolescents, and Families: Practitioners Share Their Most Effective TechniquesMore Creative Interventions for Troubled Children and YouthShort-Term Play Therapy for Children, Second Edition"
4,VERY HELPFUL,THE BOOK WAS VERY INFORMATIVE AND SEVERAL RESOURCES THAT I WAS ABLE TO USE IMMEDIATELY. IT'S WORTH THE MONEY.
4,Great basic for your bookshelf,"This book has good techniques and ideas to use with children and teens to conquor many common concerns, such as divorce, changes in families, nightmares, etc. The book provides research why particular methods are used which is helpful in getting parents to participate."
3,Calvin Coolidge,Not one of the country's more remarkable presidents and not a remarkable tome either. Very basic info on Coolidge not one of the better Presidential Biographies I have read
4,prequel to Avengers Disassembled?,This story is good but incomplete. It tdeals with the first half of the Scarlet Witch's mental breakdown(issues 42-50). The premise of the graphic novel is that the Vision is missing and his team mates must find him. The story is good and the villains behind the kidnapping are unexpected.The original 19 issue story arc (WCA 42-60) is basically Avengers Disassembled on a smaller scale. It details the different factors that drive the Scarlet Witch to become a blood thirsty anti-human villain and the person who is behind this.
4,Byrne should be doing marvel,"This is a very good run, showcasing what makes the Avengers, the Avengers. John Byrne used to epitomize Marvel for most of us, this book made you forget which was the real Avengers book at the time. The seeds of Dissasembled begin here, we also have the creation of the GLA here. John's artwork is great as always, I cant wait for the 2nd one ( if they make on ) to come, that was where even better stories residedgreat pick up"
4,The older sides don't sound bad to me.,"Great blowing by a true all star unit on the two long 1955 cuts, with the two sax stars joined by Alto man Lou Donaldson, the great Art Farmer on trumpet, and under-rated pianist Freddie Redd. (This is the first I've heard from Redd, but his credentials are impeccable. His first recording is with the Tiny Grimes band with either Red Prysock or Benny Golson on sax, about 1949. Anyway, he crossed paths with both saxmen on other Grimes dates. He's also recorded with such legends as LaVerne Baker, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Oscar Pettiford, Arthur Taylor (on a Farmer session), Tommy Potter, and Jackie McLean. He is still active, and has apparently recorded at Birdland in 2010 (unissued). Info from ""Jazzrealities"" website.)I'm totally unaware of any of the 1951 sidemen, but these tunes sound fine to my ears, actually pretty good for mono recordings from the early 50's. The later ones sound sensational! Got to check out the ""Boss Tenors"" on Verve next."
2,PRE HI-FI JAZZ,"The sound quality of the short tracks from the early 50's is not very good at all. The two long tracks from 1955 (with Lou Donaldson and Art Farmer in the front line) is better, but the solo order of Alto- Trumpet- Piano- Tenor- on both tracks may be a put off. Better to start your Gene Ammons collection with THE HAPPY BLUES with Art Farmer & Jackie McLean up front- from 1956"
3,Need more extra spaces,This case is good for Sony HDR-HC1 HDV Handycam camcorderbut incovenient for its lack of extra rooms for tapes and other accessories.
1,Beware...,"While Sister Wendy's intentions are admirable in her enthusiastic description of the best art to be found in American galleries, her interpretations often completely miss the point. For example, in talking about Seurat's ""Sunday Afternoon at La Grande Jatte"" (Art Institute of Chicago), she does not even mention it's companion work ""Bathers at Asnieres"", and so gives an extremely basic interpretation that completely undermines Seurat's socialist intentions in these two paintings. Anyone with more than a very fleeting interest in Art in general should steer well clear of this book, and if you're a student of Art History (like me), run a mile."
2,What was Blue Note thinking?,"Pat Martino is an amazing guitarist with many great recordings. His playing is remarkable!Someone dropped the ball on this highly anticipated recording. The sound quality is bad. You can't hear his guitar, even the other instruments are mixed poorly. I'm sure Pat is furious, there is no way a perfectionist such as he would find the mix acceptable.Something needs to be done before anymore copies are distributed.You'd think record companies would strive to release perfect sound quality recordings considering the dramatic decrease in CD sales!"
3,Somewhat busy playing,"I didn't notice the sound problems others have complained about, but if you want to hear some Wes Montgomery, then buy some Wes Montgomery. Pat Martino was one of the greats in the 70s. This modern date is fine, but nothing about it seemed terribly compelling. There are an awful lot of notes. I wished for more space between them"
5,really enjoyed this movie,If you're looking for a really good movie that your family can watch ( teenagers best though ) this movie will have you wanting to watch more in this series. Have some tissues close by though. lol
3,Enjoyed this movie as part of a series.,"I watched the first two films in the seriesand was happy to find this one. The characters are so likeable; I really cared about them. I think this one is more enjoyable if you've seen the first two. All three movies are highly sentimental, brought a tear to my eye...If you like that, I recommend them all. Although I think the first was absolutely the best (the mystery involved was intriguing), I enjoyed this one enough to hope they will make The Note #4."
3,Wholesome movie!,"This is the third movie in this series and again I was most taken with such a lovely story line. It is so nice to watch a movie with no swearing or vulgarity yet giving me fulfillment. The ending was lovely and hopefully has given a leadway to another movie in this series. I enjoy all different types of movies but to watch, what I call, a ""Wholesome"" movie is such good value!"
3,I've never had this item,I don't know how this came to me as I have never had this item. Please take it off my personal information
3,A Bit of A Let Down,"My husband and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the first 2 movies so much that we instantly got them on DVD when they were available. We saw that The Note III came out and were eager to see how the lives of those we got so caught up in were unfolding. Sadly, we were disappointed with the plot of this movie. The magic that the other 2 films had were not in this one. I would have given it 2.5 stars if I could have. It just fell short in a lot of ways and we personally weren't fans of how things played out in this film. I couldn't recommend the first two installments more....just leave off there and don't go down this road."
3,OK but not for the experienced,"I've been holding meetings and attending meetings for many years. I expected a book that would have ideas that I could use to make meetings more effective. This book would help someone who was new to the experience but it was not helpful for me. Much of it was very basic and a lot of it was PC baloney about how not to offend people with chips on their shoulders. Probably useful for people who hold seminars but not for managers, unless they are the namby-pamby type.Otherwise, the book is well-organized and clearly written."
1,Have you heard Chopin Etudes before?,"If you want to know how NOT to play Chopin Etudes you must rush and order this CD immediately. I think that anyone who attempts to record anything these days should at least listen to what already exists on the market. Mr. Lifschitz obviously pretends that recordings of Ashkenasy, Argerich, Ginsburg, Pollini, Berezovsky and many others simply do not exist if he permits the release of HIS ""version"" of Chopin's Op.10. Simply put: when one doesn't have the fingers one should not record these Etudes. They are for the masters, not for students!"
3,good book for ideas,"I liked this book, but I am not sure if I will ever use any of the exact recipes. It is a good source for ideas on what other people have done. It is much like when a neighborhood puts out a cookbook, but this time is is a nation's homebrew recipe book."
1,Random.,"This is a collection of random recipes submitted by homebrewers across the country. The recipes weren't tested by the authors. The majority are extract recipes which might clue you in to the level of submissions. Save your money and just read a few homebrew forums; you'll get hundreds of similar recipes. I bought the book because there is a page on formulating a mash recipe based on one using extract, but upon returning home found the the calculation is wrong! I made the mistake of buying the authors' (Stevens and Lutzen) other book, Brew Ware, at the same time. It is equally lame!"
3,Many more worthy books,"Purchased this book and was excited about getting it based off reviews. When I began reading it, it seemed the writers had people send them recipes, and they never even tried them to see if they were good or not. A couple recipes have suggestions because they didn't come out very good. I have compared these to recipes found online, and many are off type, have hard to find ingredients, or just not that original.If you are building an extensive library on homebrewing, this book would be a decent fit. But I would get Beer Captured, Radical Brewing, How to Brew, Brewing Classic Styles, Brew Like a Monk, Clone Brews, and Designing Great Beers way ahead of this book."
5,In flames meets Iced Earth...39 cents!!!,"Silent Scythe may have only released one album before disbanding, but they made one hell of an album...The band play a hybrid of melodic death metal with a power metal vocalist...I could best describe the music as In flames with Matt Barlow on vocals...honestly the vocalist on this album is amazing, having a powerful midrange and the ability to soar in upper registers ala Rob Halford or Tim Owens...for the price( currently only .39 cents) you could do far worse than this forgotten gem...a must for fans of In Flames, Iced Earth, Mercenary, and Nevermore"
5,One Way to Entertaining...,"A wickedly imaginative first novel. If you've never believed in the power of music, Gary Jonas' <i>One Way Ticket to Mighnight</i> will make you a believer. This is a frightening yet redemptive story that makes you believe in and care about a seemingly unlovely hero in Roy Porter.Everyone battles a sense of chaos in their lives, only Jonas has made it larger and more dangerous than life. Roy and Jim battle through personal as well as mystical demons in order to find their peace.It's fast pace and colorful characters also make it for an engrossing read, so don't start reading it without making sure you have plenty of time to finish it. You won't regret the time spent with this book or this author. Jonas has proven himself an excellent story teller, and as a fine wine, he can only get better with time."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!!,This is not authorised by the band therefore the quality is terrible.You are better off waiting for the re-issues that are on there way!!!
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"This is not an authorized Iron Maiden DVD.This was a documentary released back when maiden was on the World Slavery Tour. They had just played some historic gigs ""behind the iron curtain"". The documentary was great, this DVD is not.The production is horrible. Don't waste your money.For any authorized DVD release from the band, check out their web site. More over, Rod Smallwood and Steve Harris have repeatedly warned fans about boot leg garbage like this.I believe the band has plans to release their entire back catalog of videos onto DVD, so again, don't waste your money on this junk, and wait for the real thing from the band.Up The Irons!"
5,Extremly well done,For anyone who tends to fall asleep during the normal documentary will be pleased with Strange Days. The information contained in these videos are key in changing the way things are. I hope more people will watch this.
5,Pay Attention!,This was well researched and well presented. It helped a lot that Edward Norton was the narator but the topic at large is very concerning.
5,Mysterious and seductive,"Loreena McKennitt got me hooked on Celtic music; Ceredwen has reeled me in. The closing track on this CD, ""Er Mwyn y Plant (For the Children)"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard in years, and ""Beltaine"" is pure Pagan magic. Ceredwen's music is always understated but never less than spellbinding. They have created an emerald middle space between the atmospheric dreaminess of Enya and the earthy spirit-rhythms of Loreena. Put the disk on, turn off the lights, and drift to a time and land far away..."
5,Worth Its Weight In Gold,"The title says it all. The CD does not surpass Cerdwen's debut effort, but definitely equals it. Combining the sweet traditional Welsh music with the telling of an epic poem to newage and ambient sounds, songs like ""Beltaine"" and ""Boudicca"" give me goosebumps everytime they play. This release is similar to their first CD, ""Legends Of The Celts"", but has more up-tempo beats to it. Yet another find release from this duo, who I hope continues to create stunning music for years to come."
3,It's no O'r Mabinogi...,"It's not a bad album, all in all, and if I had bought it never having heard O'r Mabinogi, I probably would have liked it a lot, but after their first album, this one was a real disappointment - very upbeat and bubble-gummy, which just doesn't sound good in welsh."
1,Cheap plastic arrives pre-scratched!,"This seemed like it would be just the thing to protect my PSP. I carefully opened the packaging and to my surprise found the protector had 5 deep gouges in various parts of the screen-area and about a dozen minor scratches all over the cheap plastic surface. Sure this thing will protect your glossy PSP screen from new scratches, but the scratches on the gameshield sure make the PSP look like it has already taken a beating.I'll probably only put this thing on if I let my nephews play on the PSP. You'd probably be better off with static adhesive screen protectors."
1,8 Razzie Awards for a reason,"In the words of Comicbook Guy from The Simpsons,""Worst, Movie...EVER!"" This movie was horrible. I have ordered several dozen things online and never written a review, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to comment on this movie. Save your money, even if it's just $3. I only bought this movie because I wanted to see Kenya Moore - hell, she only had 2 lines and wasn't seen again! And if you want to see a young hottie, I got more bad news for you...Lindsay Lohan is NOT as hot as everyone says she is. You have been warned."
2,Interesting but not good,"This was not a great movie. It was strange to watch, because I felt like I was watching a student film project which attempted to use a series of dramatic devices and failed. I think that the director must have been a fan of David Lynch, because there were some things that were reminiscent of his movies-- doppelgangers, blue and red lighting, and pale brunettes. But the movie is basically a logical sequence of events, not a Lynchian dream-trance, and the stylistic execution is not effective.The main reason to watch this movie is the plot. I will not dispute the other reviewers who point out that it has some cliches, but it is at least somewhat interesting."
3,"Bookend for ""Parent Trap""","I gave this movie three stars to average out my reactions to it. It certainly is a bad movie. There's no denying it. But there are several really clever ideas in it, and as bad as it was, I couldn't tear myself away from watching it. She doesn't seem to have put her best effort into this movie, but she still has some sort of compelling screen presence that I can't quite explain. This movie makes a perfect bookend for ""The Parent Trap"" for several reasons."
3,dark side of girl,"Where has lovely lindsay gone?It must be much better for her to act more realistic, ordinary, or comedic person."
5,Very good movie!!!,"I saw this movie back when it came out and thought it was really good.The plot is very good and intressting and lindsey lohan does a good job in the movie.Alot of pepole hated it becase lindsey stars in it ,but give it a chance.Things the movie could of went without were the long strip scenes they were needed but not that many.The gore was pretty heavy but there is one scene were it is just stupid.But my sister (13)who hates gory scary movies loved it.I cant wait to buy it and watch it again ,but eveyone who likes thrillers needs to watch it they wont be sorry!"
4,Blue,"So i watched this movie 3 times now... and i could watch it another 8 times. I have no idea why but i like this movie a lot. Well for starters, I love the cover box art and that right there is always a plus. I liked Lindsay Lohan in Just My Luck and other such films so what the heck you know? I loved the blue color effect throughout the movie. Blue is one of my fav. colors and it reminded me of Sin City, where the certain color stood out while the rest was all black and white..... The pole dancing was always fun to watch though no doubt now she's doing it in real life, what with the way way she's going down hill. Anyway, i liked the plot, some of the characters and the twist at the end of the film."
2,A lack of cohesion.,"Good thriller, despite some parts of this movie seemed a bit confused and lost. I could add one more star if was not this lack of cohesion. Instead, I have noticed artistic pretensions, but this last one, unfortunately, didn't reach any place."
1,So Much Potential to Be a Great Movie....,"Alright, ""I Know Who Killed Me"" had a lot of potential to be a really good suspense film based on the storyline alone..... However, with that being said, the storyline was atrocious, not to mention Lindsay Lohan CANNOT ACT!! The storyline had a few perks, but as a whole it was awful and sophomoric.The cast of characters were equally horrid and one dimensional.... The serial killer really wasn't that developed as to why he was doing what he did.Lindsay Lohan's character seemed more likely to be a college aged character, not a high school student in her senior year of high school.The parents of Lohan's character were so uninvolved in her life until she got kidnapped and even then didn't act the way I thought parents of a kidnapped teenager would act.The FBI characters in this movie acted unrealistic and superficial.This was just an all around bad movie. How can a movie with so much potential to be good, go so wrong?"
1,terrible movie,terrible movie. Pointless confusing plot. bad acting. a bad attempt at remaking parent trap except trying to add horror. lindsay lohan shouldn't have taken this movie offer.
1,Predictability killed this one...,"Unfortunately this film had promise but there is an early scene that is a total giveaway as to the murderer. Knowing from the get-go who the bad guy is takes all of the thrill from this thriller. But let me lament on Ms. Lohan's performance. I loved her in ""Mean Girls"" but this one is a true portrait of the same girl we saw in the probation hearings this past week. Her favorite word is fu**, and she loves to exude this with physical traits...if you get my drift. Avoid this. Hopefully Ms. Lohan will learn from her real-life misgivings and work on the traits she displayed in ""Mean Girls"". She has promise, but this one is just another second-rate BOMB! Only one star!"
1,Worst Movie Ever!,"This has got to be the worst movie ever, it is a waste of money and time ! The acting is HORRIBLE!!!! The plot line sucks! Do not rent it your only wasting your money!"
1,"Close Second To ""Gigli""","I thought this movie did so poorly, because Miss Lohan was too busy going to rehab twenty times to promote it. Turns out it was just really bad. For a number of reasons--LL plays a cracked out stripper, Lonelygirl15 plays her best friend, and, of course, the introduction of ""twin stigmata."" This movie will bore you to your core. Just stay away from it."
1,I Know Who Killed Me,You sent me the wrong movie. I ordered I Know Who Killed Me and you sent The Pursuit of Happyness. I am furious. I needed this for a party and now I have to re order from someone else.
2,Not so bad....,"I have been avoiding this movie like the plague for quite a while now based upon the reviews I have read. Last Friday however, I came across this movie again sitting on the shelf in the library and I finally decided to give it a shot. I wasn't sure at first but, 20 minutes into the movie, I decided that it may have been given an unfair shot. Was the acting A+? not really, could the plot have been stronger? yes. All in all however, if you have an hour and a half to spare this would not be the worst way to spend it."
3,Not Her Fault It's Flawed,"Good cast, decent script, weird clue-dropping, very unlikely plot twist, looks fairly good (not as pretty as Captivity tho), not that sexy, the cruel bits were probably a shock to Lindsay's old fan base. That may explain the negative response. Hey, it's a murder mystery! I've seen worse - so have you."
4,Interesting to say the least. I really would give it a 3.5.,This movie has it problems exspecailly the ending but it defianatly keeps you guessing. I do not want to give away any of the movie so I will just say that it starts off ok but the ending does suck.
2,Good story but bad acting,Im gonna give credit to the writer and the production crew here. I thought I'd check it out because I think Lindsey is cute. Rent it first people. The best scenes are when Lindsey is onstage.
3,"Confusing, and yet artistic","I Know Who Killed Me isn't the worst film, but it was not great either. Even though this movie got horrendous reviews, I saw it on starz on demand, and said ""hey this isn't that bad, Lindsay is hot as a stripper"". So I ignored the reviews and saw it and liked it. Even though the film was confusing, the film was artistically beautiful with the blue roses."
1,Adding the 'F' word to your repertoire isn't always good,"Oh man, this was one bad movie. Lindsay Lohan, from MEAN GIRLS and CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE DRAMA QUEEN and HERBIE and JUST MY LUCK. Here, we have her doing a more dramatic role. Dramatic in this case means she gets to pole dance and say the 'F' word a lot. I see nothing wrong with doing more adult roles, but come on, Lindsay, read the stinking script first before you accept a part. I just wonder what they could have done to make this film worse than it is. Even if seeing Lindsay Lohan less than fully dressed is your idea of worthwhile viewing, I say pass. She doesn't look that good in this film. Even tortured and mutilated, I couldn't feel sorry or really care about her character(s). The film moved slowly, was poorly photographed in dim light and at times was incoherent. I would not even recommend this for a one time rental. In conclusion, I hope Lindsay gets better parts and her career picks up. I like her. She doesn't need to do this trash."
2,Must Like Lindsey Lohan,"First of all, don't even touch this film unless you are already biased and are smitten with Lindsey. With that said, the film is not total crap but definetly not good. The violent parts are really unnessary but there is a hot sex scene. Really, the best thing about this dvd lies in the bonus features section. There is an extended strip scene that is worth the cost of the disc itself (especially if you buy it used like I did). Enjoy!"
3,Service was fine but don't recommend the movie.,Service was fine but don't recommend the movie. I like suspense but this was out there. Moving onto the next one.
3,Okay movie,Good Story line and great characters just you never actually understand why the person is doing it.
3,Lindsay Lohan,"The acting was just ok and it was way too gorey for me. I had seen the end of it on lifetime before, but had been wanting to see the beginning. It was ok."
2,mixed feelings,"This movie had a great premise, and the story itself was unique and interesting. With the right screenplay, the story would have really shone. However, some parts of the story were rather flimsy, and the ending... meh. If the story was significantly adjusted in some parts, then the movie would have stood a serious chance. As it is now... no. Definitely rent this movie, for me it was hard enough watching just once.I would however recommend that you watch the alternate ending. I actually liked it better than the 'real' ending."
3,Ending leaves a bad taste in your mouth!,"I know who killed me is Lindsey Lohan's first R rated film. In this role she plays a girl with memory loss, who has lost her limbs after escaping a sick kidnapping involving torture. Unable to explain what happened, she insist that she isn't the same girl who was kidnapped. Lohan's character sets out to discover what happened and who she really is.I was really rooting for Lohans first mature film experiment, but it didn't live up to my expectations. I found it watchable (as in, it wasn't so bad that I felt compelled to leave the theater). However, it wasn't great either. Most of the time I felt like I was watching the teenybooper version of one of the SAW movies. The worst part by far was the ending which I found predictable and lame.It's worth a rental, but not worth buying for your DVD collection (unless your collection is a dust magnet)."
1,I KNOW WHAT KILLED THIS MOVIE! 1 1/2 STARS!,"This is a strange movie! It's absolutely ridiculous with huge plot holes you could drive a truck through, but I managed to stick with it to the perplexing ending! Quite gory for this type a film with lots of bloody dismemberment scenes and has quite a few totally unnecessary (Lohan) strip pole sequences, so obviously put there to keep guys from falling asleep.....it doesn't work! I've seen worse, so I guess I would give it 1 1/2 stars for tricking me into watching this 2 hour piece of $#it! You've been warned!"
3,"Great BD, Bad Movie",This movie is just bad. The only redeaming value I found was the extended Strip Tease scene. The alternate opening and ending are a must to understand the story. It is really bad over all. Only get it if you are a fan of Mrs. Lohan and need some time of LL Fix.
4,You'll be surprised at who killed her,"4 of 5 stars for the suspense thriller I Know Who Killed Me. Lindsay Lohan stars in this movie about a crazed guy who like to kill people. Lohan is one of his victims, but, she has a story to be told--who killed her. She returns to her life as a different person. Yeah, a bit confusing, but, interesting. A well made movie with a good plot. It keeps you guess right til the end. A big surprise twists the last 20% of the movie into something very unexpected. This movie is loaded with adult content and images, some very graphic scenes that are not for the weak of stomach. A good movie, well worth the watching. The Blu-Ray was lacking in extra contents compared to other movies."
2,"Ouch, what a confusing mess and this in high-def","I wanted to like it but I gave up. The story is confusing and the director seems to think that changing colors from one scene to the next would look interesting - it doesn't. Miss Lohan isn't a bad actress I think but this role was just plain awful for her. And I don't only mean the second part where she is kind of handicapped. And by the way: It is not really an erotic movie. And I mention this as a guy.The higher resolution and clarity of colors make this movie actually worse than it would have been on a somewhat blurry standard definition DVD. I don't really know what else to say about this movie - let's just forget about it and watch the next one, I guess."
3,A few holes here and there but it kept me intrigued,"Okay, I'm going to say first hand that I adore Ms. Lohan and have since she was a child. I grew up with her for the most part. She was a big draw as to why I wanted to see this and despite her media attention, her personal life should have nothing to do with her professional life.The movie wasn't the best, some of the acting was bad, but sometimes even with great movies you an have one or two that over-act things.The twist on the storyline is actually a good one and I think a lot of people who are complaining about the twist perceive it as impossible. I don't believe that so it made the movie very interesting for me.I wasn't crazy about the ending and I had a lot of questions, but all in all it wasn't an awful movie.If you are a fan of hers, buy it for your collection. If you're not a fan of hers, rent it and watch it to give it back, but it is worth a watch."
1,She should have stuck to the high school act,"I might have enjoyed this movie if they would have picked someone other than Lindsey Lohan to play the lead role. Nothing against Lindsey, I don't mind her as an actress. Damsel in distress just isn't up her alley.This movie isn't worth owning... or renting... or even talking about."
4,"Off-the-radar country oldies from the 1950s, '60s and '70s...","A fun, funky set of obscuro country recordings, drawn from deep in the vaults of Aubrey Mayhew's now-defunct indie label, Little Darlin'... If you like rare, oddball material, this disc is for you... Some of these songs are really goofy, some are really great."
5,For Apollo Freaks Only,"An incredible six DVD set encompassing the next to last manned flight to the moon in April, 1972. Mark Gray's Spacecraft Films has realized a dream for many Apollo Freaks that have wanted the best quality footage and video availiable of America's early space missions. Previously released bootleg videos of the Apollo moonwalks were copied from grainy film kinescopes, not the master videotapes. For this new set, Spacecraft Films made sure that nearly all of the lunar EVA video had been digitally enhanced and remastered from the master two-inch videotape reels that were stored at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. This results in that ""live as it happened"" look that only original master videotape can give you. Bravo, Spacecraft Films!"
2,Apollo 16: Journey to Descartes,"Problems with playback, as indicated in some reviews. Disk one will not playback the launch and disk 6 will not playback the splashdown. These were tested on several different players. My set was purchased brand new and factory sealed, the disk surfaces are perfect. Fortunately most of the moonwalks play. Some disks freeze and stop prior to the end of the recordings. I'm not sure just how much of the moonwalks are unwatchable. This would be a 5-star review, if not for the manufacturing defects. I would recommend contacting Spacecraft Films to get reassurance that these defects will be corrected with the new pressing due out in fall of 2010."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM SPACECRAFT FILMS,"I purchased this set and then discovered that several sections would not play, either in my Mac or my Toshiba dvd player. The defective dvd's cause my Mac and dvd player to completely freeze up, and the only option to correct the problem is to unplug the power cord. When I contacted Spacecraft Films, they refused to believe me, and refused to replace the faulty dvd's. My recommendation to you is, DO NOT purchase from this company!"
3,A Fun Book...Not Too Serious,"Read this work several times. It is obvious a fun book with brief chapters dealing with a variety of ""common"" personality types found in the work place. Even though it contains psychological things, it appears to be primarily a ""tongue-in-cheek"" book using Greek Mythology names for the subject employee types. Of course, the ""died-in-the-wool"" Psychologists or Management Experts will criticize the book as being trite, lame, and not ""backed by scientific research."" However, my honest opinion is that this book was intended as both a fun piece and some diverted reading for individuals working in management, personnel psychology, and human resources. It also is a touch candid in the comparisons and even ""arrow shooting"" at certain employee types that are either irritating and/or whatever. Try it! You'll hopefully like it as I did."
5,Great Boogie,"Well, this is just a great piano boogie album. The Preacher does a fabulous job, your toes start tapping and they won't stop for an hour. The first cut is 30+ minutes and you'll be in heaven. Try driving down the freeway with this CD playing and your hands on the wheel - you can't do it. You just got to play the baseline along with the Preacher. Fun, fun, fun."
2,Not what I expected...,"I expected ""round"" Skookies. That is what the picture showed. Instead I received ""square"" Skookies. I think that the picture should represent what the item is. The square shape will probably work alright...but I wanted round ones."
5,Great Right out of the Box,"I received these shoes 10 days before my first half marathon. There was no time for break in. My Asics were worn out and causing knee pain. First run 6 miles-no problem. Second run 10 miles- it hurt, but it wasn't the shoes. Third run 3 mile taper before the race- felt like I was running on air. The BIG RACE 13 miles- whoa baby it was hard....but the shoes were awesome. Very little knee pain and still felt cushy during grueling mile 12. These shoes were much more cushioned that my Nimbus IV's right out of the box. The New Balance are also roomier in the toes. I was starting to get a calous from the Asics. Expensive but highly reccomended."
4,"great shoe, good support, comfortable!","I really spent some on-line time searching for a good running/workout shoe. These are perfect. I put them on and went for a run, no break in was necessary! I'm going to need another pair in a few months."
4,Good stability shoe,I have high arches which cause extreme charlie horses in my calves when I run. These shoes provide great support so that I no longer have these problems. The cushion is great and I've noticed a difference in less impact on my knees. A great shoe - it's too bad they discontinued this model.
2,Painful,"I had such hopes for this book based on all the wonderful reviews. I am giving it two stars only because the cover design is so pretty. The author creates a main character (deceased) who is purely unlikeable for the first half of the book. She describes repeatedly how unlikeable she was from the perspective of each person of the small Sicilian town. Talk about beating a dead horse. Simply torturous reading. The family that the dead person worked for is also mostly unlikeable. More torturous reading. The second half of the book perks up a bit with a few intersting plot turns and creative plot line but still, I could NOT wait to finish this book so the pain would be over.I have to be honest, the book even squashed my desire to visit Sicily."
3,too many names to confuse,"i give this book a 3.5. i liked it but it was tedious trying to figure out the names and confusing some common names with titles. i learned about the time about which it was written, and the place was also quite unique and interesting."
2,Where's the Thrill Kill we all know and love?,"Haven't heard anything worth buying from Thrill Kill since Hit & Run Holiday. None of the remixes or unreleased tracks are especially stunning. They even omitted the cool vocals remixes of songs like Dimentia 66. As the subtitle suggests, however, this album would make a decent soundtrack for a strip club. Otherwise, it offers nothing new."
1,Bad remixes of thier dullest material,"Typical retro glam tripe that made me stop listening to them after ""13 Above The Night."" They've lost their way and explains why they've lost band members. Go listen to ""Electric Hellfire Club"" if you miss the good old days of ""Cuz It's Hot"" and ""Kooler Than Jesus."" This sissy junk has nothing to do with why they started in the first place."
4,Smart Looking,"I liked this watch because is was simple but elegant. The size of the watch is good for a woman's wrist and the silver with the inlaid wood makes it stand out just enough. You can remove links on the watch band for a better fit, however, I can't get the watch to fit snug ( the only draw back ). Overall it is a good watch and with the Fossil name, I expect it to last."
4,Garrity Key Light,"Excellent product. Slim, bright and useful.The battery on the last one I had lasted about 15 months.Garrity K001GST12NU LED Key Chain Lite"
3,Saurons Eye,"Good price for a novelty toy. If your a diehard fan of the genre, this makes a nice keepsake or present."
2,90's new agey bollucks.,"While there is a lot of very good history in this book, within the first 10 pages, Padfield delivers his hypothesis on Heinrich Himmler. The man was the way he was because he wasnt breast fed. 'Nuff said."
4,mentioned in Emotion: The On Off Swtich For Learning,"Mentioned in the excellent book Emotion: The On Off Switch For Learning, by Priscilla L. Vail (see pages 128-129). Discusses the distant father, the good enough father, the demanding father, the seductive father, the absent father, and the doting father. Discusses how the ""emotional stances"" of adult women may be traced back to what their relationship with their father was like. Very true for me."
2,lonesome dove series,An excelent set of dvds but the sleeve that they were in was a bit tight for me to get the dvds out without splitting the sleeve
4,The New Piano is a Sonic Encounter,"Margaret Leng Tan plays prepared piano works from John Cage (the father of the prepared piano), Alan Hovhaness, George Crumb, Somei Satoh, & Ge Gan-Ru with this highly original & well recorded CD. The prepared piano was created by John Cage in the 1940's to save space & cost from hiring several percussion musicians while at the same time creating new sounds with inserted items or re-tuning the piano. In the later 20th century, several composers took up the practice to create certain tonalities or soundscapes with the prepared piano. In this recording Alan Hovhaness & George Crumb are west meeting east, while Somei Satoh & Ge Gan-Ru are east meeting west, all creating a multi-cultural modern classical expression not to be missed."
5,I do own it and it I can see it fine,"To be honest I sell these, but I do not sell anything I consider to be a flawed product. A person of average eyesight who is able to compose an image through an s3's viewfinder should have no problem reading the high contrast print on the card. It contains a great index of all camera functions. The price may seem high for a single laminated card, but the guy who publishes these spent a great deal of time putting the information together an organizing it. That is what you are paying for. The shipping charges are set by each seller, adn reflect the time packaging and mailing in addition to the cost of postage."
5,the best sheets!,"I am very happy with these sheets. I was looking for some cheap, comfortable sheets and found these on Amazon- the only color available was celery, but it's really quite a nice color. They fit my extra long twin bed PERFECTLY- not baggy at all and they don't wrinkle any more than other sheets. I was skeptical about ordering jersey knit sheets because I heard they get stretched out and stuff but these are awesome and so very, very soft. They also don't make you sweat on hot nights. Just what I hoped for!"
2,Good BASIC book,Little weak on the more complex features of oscommerce.. This book needs to be a first chapter of a more in-depth book.
4,A very good CD...,"This CD is excelllent. It has the driving rythms that fans of Funker Vogt are used to, and some down-and-out creepiness (Hangman). The Vocal come through nicely, and the rythms make you wanna move. The only problem is that it slightly slips into the techno-trance route. This is alright in small doses, but here it just seems out of place -> looses rythm, and beat.... Thus the 4 stars instead of 5."
2,Board Member's Guide,"The content of this ""book"" is fine but it should be advertised for what it is; a pamphlet. I expected a ""book"" (more than 17 pages.) I cannot quibble with the scope but it is very cursory. No depth to the content. I would liken it to an outline or a brochure; definitely not a ""book."" Actually I felt a bit ""ripped off."""
1,"If this clock's atomic, the apocalypse happened.","Bought this clock because it was going to be placed in a very high location which I hoped to only need to visit once a year to replace a battery. No such luck. First of all, this clock has a microchip in it that sets it by time zone and is 100% NOT atomic. I know this because on those rare occasions when it did have the ability to have the time even remotely correlate to the real world time, it would change to daylight savings time before my atomic clocks would. The clock is essentially garbage after less than one year of ownership. It does not keep the correct time, it is not atomic and it makes a loud noise as it attempts to reset itself pretty much every hour. I suggest that La Crossee keep on making tweezers and stay away from clocks. One of the worst purchases I ever made. It's not even right once a day. Just threw it away and wanted to spare other buyers from this mistake."
4,Works Great in a School,"I really like these clocks. Our school was constantly having problems with the clocks in all the classrooms being different and this has really helped the situation. The digital ones are better but the La Crosse ones, which are the least expensive, also happen to be the best analog clocks we've tried."
1,Not good in concrete buildings,"Our establishment ordered 22 La Crosse atomic wall clocks. Only a handfull of the clocks managed to pick up a signal. The other clocks had to be set manually which is time consuming. Once they were set manually, they would not keep accurate time. According to the instructions the clocks have trouble picking up signals in concrete buildings with steel reinforcement like the three story office building we occupy. Do not purchase if you are in one of these type of buildings. Also two of the clocks did not work at all."
2,Second hand stopped working after 2 months,"The product worked very well for the first 2 months, but then suddenly the second hand stopped working and it didn't reset its time to daylight savings time as advertised, even with the clock near a window and new batteries installed.Unfortunately, you can't set the time on this unit manually, so if it does not update automatically, you pretty much have just a non-functional ""wall decoration""."
5,Best and Most Readable Clock,"This clock is the best wall clock we have ever had. No exceptions. I used to buy clocks to fit the decor, but no more. We need a clock we can read without our glasses being on. Note how clearly the numbers are seen And, there's a second hand so I also use the one in the kitchen as a timer. This is a large clock at 14"" diameter. It is also ""atomic,"" as the time is derived from the Colorado atomic clock and is always accurate. There's one AA battery to run it, and radio waves determine the time. I also have another atomic clock in the great room, so rather than search the room for a clock to tell the time, we just look up from our dining table and there it is. My husband and I simply love these clocks!"
1,Lousy Clock - Lousy Support,"Purchased this clock. Followed the directions and the clock set itself, only problem, I selected Eastern time, it set itself to Pacific Time. So I called the support line as requested only to get sent to a voice mail box 4 times. No call back all afternoon. Returning clock in tomorrow's mail."
1,"Would give it 0, if I could","Piece of garbage. Horrible support. Returned the first one, they made me pay shipping. When they wanted me to pay to return the second piece of garbage, I just threw in the towel. No more La Crosse Defective Technology for me. Avoid like the plague."
1,Worst clock ever!,"I got this about 2 weeks ago. I am in Southern CA. By default, the clock preset to PST, DST is on.First, the clock did not sync after put in battery for the first time. I had to manually set it. After 2-3 days, it automatically rolled back exactly 1 hour. I had to manually correct it. Then it happened again in 2-3 days. I will return it back to Amazon."
2,Short Lifetime,"The size and style are good with an easy to read dial. Before the end of the first year, the second hand quit working. Within the next few months the clock failed completely. We have switched to a Quartz analog clock which has worked fine. We would rather change the time manually than take a chance on another La Crosse Atomic clock."
4,La Crosse Atomic Wall Clock,I purchased the clock for the church building and I'm very satisfied with it: It's easy to read from a distance and so far has been accurate. It even updated itself to the correct time with the change to daylight savings time.
1,Caveat Emptor if you don't live on the continent,"Perhaps it was my own fault. I thought I had found the perfect clock -- good size face, numbers and hands; simple black and off-white color scheme. Unfortunately, although I checked to make sure it could be set manually, I missed the part that said the time would AUTOMATICALLY reset as soon as it found a signal. Hawaii is not in one of the four official time zones the clock services. One more reason, perhaps, why we should secede from the US. The clock can be reset, but I'd have to pay shipping to and from, which would come very close to or exceed the cost of the clock and original shipping. So now I have a great clock sitting on my desk that I can't set."
1,Poor Quality,I purchased 20 of these clocks for my classrooms and after about 6 months 25% of them no longer work. You get what you pay for.
1,Many problems,The clock was off by -4 hours even after so called rebooting. I called tech support and they requested me to send the clock back to them at my cost so that they can pop the hands off and advance it four hours. They should have replaced it for free but they did not. I just think this clock is just a big hoax.
3,Worked for a while,"We put this outside by our pool. It worked great at first, but now, a month or two later, it doesn't seem to set itself. When I reset it, it only gets within 6 hours of the right time. Sigh....I have never found an atomic clock that actually works consistently."
1,Such high hopes,"When I received this clock, I popped in the batteries, and it soon started setting the time...at least until the minute hand hit the fifty-minute mark, from where it refused to move. Upon the advice of tech support, I exchanged the clock, and its replacement kept perfect time...as long as you didn't look at the second hand. The hour and minute hands were dead-on, but the second hand moved at a rate seven seconds per hour faster. No amount of resetting (or tech support) would solve the problem, so I threw in the towel and returned it for a refund. Pity. It's exactly the clock I was looking for...except for the not-working part."
4,La Crosse Atomic Clock,So far the La Crosse WT-3143A atomic wall clock is working OK.I still feel that there are a few bugs that have to be worked out with this type of product. Only...time... will tell.
3,atomic clock,Work great for first few weeks and then the second hand froze even though clock kept perfect time. Have returned and am waiting for a replacement that is delayed because of lack of stock.
4,Good clock,"Easy to set up. Works well. Keeps good time. Hasn't broken yet. Cheaply made, but looks okay."
5,Works Great,"I was a little leery from all the negative reviews. We have a preschool and need accurate clocks to determine when a parent is picking up late, and so that staff come on and off duty on time. The clocks we have vary from a few Atomix brand that are smaller round (and work great) a Chaney outside, and a few La Crosse. We are located in California. This La Crosse is hanging inside on a west facing wall pointed towards the Pacific. There are two buildings and a steel storage container between it and a clear view to Colorado, and it adjusts itself just fine. And, we can see if from across the room."
2,Fair clock - Poor Vendor (Ambient Weather),"Bought two identical clocks for work from Amazon which were supplied by Ambient Weather in Chandler, AZ. One clock worked fine, the other never worked (right out of box). Contacted Amazon to return defective clock. Amazon passed request on to Ambient Weather. I was furnished with a return authorization, however, I was asked to pay return postage. Not happy about paying to return something that NEVER worked. Have been using Amazon for most online purchases but will reconsider in future.Was happy with clock that did work but am worried about reliability since only one of the two clocks worked."
5,What a great clock,"This clock had set itself within 3 minutes of my inserting th battery. Keeps perfect time and is very quiet. Also, looks quite good on my den's wall."
3,Hard to get working properly,"I was really looking forward to my atomic clock. I purchased the clock because it will set its self and it has a sweep second hand. When I first got it, I popped in the batteries and hung it on the wall awaiting the time signal to set the clock. After about 30 hours it finally got the signal, set the time and I thought all was good. A couple of days latter, I noticed the second hand was stuck on 45 seconds but the minute and hour hands were correct. I replaced the batteries several times, it would run for a while and stop again. Since I originally got the thing for my home gym and needed the second hand, I moved the clock in the bedroom and put a conventional clock in the gym that had a working second hand. I didn't bother to return it since the $25 I paid for it wasn't worth the time to return it. Lesson learned, buy a cheap, NON atomic clock. This technology is not ready for prime time."
2,Doesn't live up to it's claim,"I bought this clock based on the manufactures claim that ""It also adjusts automatically for Daylight Saving Time."" That claim may have been true at some point but it's not anymore due the changes in the Daylight Saving Time schedule. It still changes using the old schedule so it's really twice the work than if I would have bought a clock that you set manually because when Daylight Savings Time comes or goes on the new schedule nothing happens and I have to trick it by selecting a different time zone that matches the current time and then when it's time to change on the old schedule it sets itself to the incorrect time zone that I used to trick it so I have to take it down and select the correct time zone. I contacted the company to find out why they were still sending out the old signal but got no response. Other than that the clock works fine."
3,Sweep second hand quit,I had the clock for about 2 weeks and it was keeping the correct time and updating with the radio signal. However the sweep second hand stopped moving! The clock continues to keep good time but the second hand is not functional. I have emailed LaCrosse with this problem but I have not heard from them yet. I am pleased the clock keeps good time even though it is installed in a metal building but I do need the second hand for some of my projects so I can only give the clock 3 stars.
2,Another second hand failure,"In common with others' reviews, the second hand on 2 out of 2 clocks just stopped never to go again"
2,polo after shave,"Product was not per the same item I previously had.It was a liquid,not a cream as Polo now produced.Polo says that liquid was wasteful and cream was introduced as preferable.Liquid is a discontinued product."
4,"Nice clean, masculine scent","Very nice. I never cared for Blue but Black and this Double Black are winners. Suited best for evening wear. Only 4 stars because it doesn't last long. Overall, very satisfied with product."
1,"Beware...Amazon pulled the old ""bait and switch"" routine","These towels cant be the ones that have been getting all those positive reviews. I really didn't want white colored towels but when Amazon dropped the price to $15, I took the bait. I bought 2 sets but when they arrived I was thoroughly disappointed. They look nothing like the plush towels pictured. These are thin, rough and cheap. I'm going to try and return them. After shipping costs, I should get about $10 per set refunded. Anything's better than being stuck with these.UPDATE: I just wanted to add that these are NOT the towels pictured. Upon closer inspection I realized that the ones I received have three decorative lines across them, whereas the towels pictured have a single line."
3,nice and soft,"These towels are very soft. Not as thick as those I got last year, and the hand towel size is smaller too."
4,So nice I ordered twice!,"The towels are so soft, washed well and are the right sizes so I ordered two more sets."
3,TV movie,A very poorly done TV movie with bad acting. Extensive lack of gore without reason.I watched half the movie and snoozed it off.
2,They Should Have Ordered Take Out,"This is a film which starts off strong and slowly deteriorates into painfully comic cliches. Euro Star George Hilton dons a cape and hams it up as Jurek, a horror movie director who is auditioning for his next film at his mansion and selects four teens to join him for dinner and horror film. As part of an Italian television series called 'BRIVIDO GIALLO', this is by far the weakest entry I have seen. Director Lamberto Bava and screenwriter Dardano Sachetti painfully put their actors through a lame outing filled with vampire jokes and Halloween theme park shenanigans. Horror fans definitely deserve better. Its no fault of Mya Communication, the transfer is crisp and clear and can be viewed in both English or Italian. For Vampire completists only."
3,NOT MY CUP OF TEA,"Let me begin by saying that I am a huge fan of Handel's vocal music, from his operas, esp. ""Julius Caesar"" to his oratorios, esp. ""Messiah"" and ""Israel in Egypt"" to the miscellaneous works like ""Dixit Dominus."" After listening to this beautifully produced recording of ""Acis and Galatea"" I realize that it is just not my cup of tea. It is relentlessly, sugary-sweet and has none of the drama of ""Julius Caesar,"" none of the fireworks of ""Alcina"" (esp. in the hard-to-find Joan Sutherland studio recording on Decca) and none of the magnificent serenity of ""Semele."" I am also a fan of the work of Les Arts Florissants & William Christie and, as usual, they do a splendid job here, although I did find the three tenors involved all rather dull. ""Acis"" is a pretty piece, but not one that I'll want to play over and over in order to find new depths, since, excuse me, there is less here than meets the ears."
3,Even small is still too big,I was hoping it was smaller when it arrived. It is too big for my dog. He can't fit the ball in his mouth. He is not touching it anymore.
2,Not as bigas you would think...,"If you're looking for large condoms, I wouldn't go with these. They might say XXL, but theyr'e more just like regular fitting. I guess I'm just a Trojan Magnum fan through and through."
1,Total Disappointment,The product was suppose to be XXl-but it Xtra Xtra Small. The product was smaller than Trojans large condom. The productdid not work at all; and should be labeled as Small not XXL.
4,History and theory of Chicago improvisation,"Rob's book covers the history of Chicago improv rather well. The only other book that does it is ""Whose Improv Is It Anyway?: Beyond Second City"" by Amy Seham. Her book is more historical/sociological than this one. His book is rather brief, and it almost assumes that you've read other books on improv before you picked it up. It has brief descriptions of several different long form structures, which makes it and ""Truth in Comedy"" by Close, Halpern, and Johnson the only two books that discuss long form. While it does offer some good advice on performance, it should be a supplement to your library and not your only source of information."
3,Try Bentley....,".I'm kind of an idiot, so something like tightning the alternator belt needs to be explained pretty clearly for me. This book shrugs that type of basic adjustment off. It spends a lot of time on things (like rebuilding the transmission) which I am never likely to do. .Hint for publishers: Maybe what we need is better description of the basic things people might actually do: change belts, tighten belts, change and gap plugs, change rotors, charge batteries and so forth. Think of the Reader's Digest car guide, but focus on specific details of a given model."
2,Good if you're already super-technical,"Assumes too much previous knowledge. Lacks basic description of what you're actually doing to the car, and why."
2,Not For Novices,I don't know much about cars and this book really reinforced that. I've had it for several years and it really has been no help at all.
4,Great reference for Wanna-be Street performers,"This is a very informative book on the art of Street Magic, but I couldn't give it five stars. First of all the book was very redundant, alot of name-dropping, over and over again. Same facts on these performers told and retold. Also for you guys/gals out there looking for tricks to do. Don't bother there are no tricks in the book. This is more for the business side of things. And in that aspect it is a great book."
4,Swarovski crystal stretch anklet,"I purchased this as a gift for my teenage niece. It is beautiful! The color is great and the flower is adorable. The only problem is that it is very long for an anklet. When you look at it you think, ""too short for a choker style necklace, too long for a bracelet or anklet"". I tried it on and it was big for my ankle (I would say I have average adult ankles). On my ankle it hung down quite a bit, but did not touch the ground. It's a shame because it really is a beautiful anklet."
1,"low quality product,waste of your money.","I bought this pads in March 2012, and installed my 1999 Mazda Miata. Last week the mechanic at car repair shop told me that I had to replace the pads soon, there was only 3mm left on these pads."
5,Sweet Story,"Every year I look for Chanukah books for my daughter. This year she is 3 1/2 and is listening to chapter books, so I wanted to get her a Chanukah story that was a bit more involved than the simple board books we have gotten in the past. This is a sweet story with beautiful pictures. I love that it is about Chanukah yet it's not simply telling the story of Chanukah, explaining the candles, etc. Instead, it's a story that just happens to take place around Chanukah time. In a society where Christmas is everywhere, it's refreshing to read a story about a family celebrating Chanukah. We also bought ""Mrs. Greenberg's Messy Hanukkah"" which is about the same family and is also a terrific book."
1,Stomach problems,"I used this product as a gravy to get my older dog to be a bit more interested in his food. He like it and ate his food (which was our goal). After a few days, he has gotten pretty sick with stomach problems resulting in an expensive vet visit. Just be careful when trying the product because I am guessing some dogs cannot tolerater this sauce."
1,Don't expect subtitles.,"While this appears to be a beautifully filmed story, I had a bit of trouble following the plot. This could be, in part, due to the fact that 60% of the DVD lacked subtitles. I don't pretend to understand Mandarin, but I'm fairly certain that most of the narration was left untranslated. Most translations seemed to be merely sentence fragments. Who subtitled this? A first-year student in Speaking Chinese 101?I admit that I only sat through the first fifteen minutes of the film, but without subtitles, how could I be expected to endure more?"
3,Suzhou River,"I saw this at the 2000 SF International Film Festival. It's an interesting film-a Chinese Vertigo, basically. The one thing I really disliked was that several of the main plot devices were based on situations that were EXTREMELY hard to swallow . I loved the imagery, though. It has a really gritty, modern edge to it that is pretty unusual for Chinese film. I definitly recommend this one, I'm buying it myself. The bad (ie:improbable) parts are bad enough (ie:improbable enough) to be enjoyed."
4,Much improved over the VHS,"This is an excellent DVD. Not Blu-ray, but still vastly superior to the VHS tape. Additional special features were a joy to watch."
3,COVERS AN IGNORED SEGEMENT OF VIETNAM VETERANS,THIS BOOK PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE VIETNAM WAR AND HOW JAPANESE AMERICAN SOLDIERS HANDLED IT. OVERALL THE STORIES ARE INTERESTING. HOWEVER THE BOOK LIMITS ITS SCOPE TO JAPANESE AMERICANS FROM THE SAME GENERAL AREA OF L.A. WHO SERVED IN THE ARMY AND MARINES. I WISH THE AUTHOR WOULD HAVE EXPANDED HIS SCOPE TO COVER ALL ASIAN AMERICANS FROM ALL THE SERVICE BRANCHES. STILL THE BOOK AT LEAST IS A GOOD START IN AN IGNORED ASPECT OF THE VIETNAM WAR.
2,Wish it were more but it's just the cheese,"Tried this since it was featured on a recent Friday sale. Interesting and almost tasty with the first few bites, it quickly turned into a gustatory barrage of sodium and fat. Way too salty and definitely not tasty enough to counter the un-nutritional information listed on the back."
3,They are ok.,"These are ok at best. They seem to be too salty, the first few round discs of baked cheese that you eat taste good, but after that it just starts to get saltier and saltier. Eating one disc feels like you are eating a spoonful of salt. They have lower salt ones available, those might be a better choice. I'm probably going to end up giving these away."
4,You Better Believe She's No Secret Anymore......,"Okay, I feel guilty for taking off a star, but Frank needs to give himself a bit of a rest and Linda a bit more of stretch -- it's just too much Wildhorn per second and some of the music lines are derivative of his songs from It's Time (which, as with Jane Olivor's First Night for her, and Mary Chapin Carpenter's Come On Come on for her, will always be the cornerstone of Eder's recording career and that's just fine (sometimes the stars align and it's just sheer perfection). In any event, Eder's singing is always sheer perfection and she (along with Olivor, Carpenter [both Karen and Mary-Chapin]) will remain a singer remembered in this century and the coming one. I hope she'll explore other writing voices the next go-round (or even do a recording of covers -- I mean, anyone who's heard her do Long and Winding Road in concert is longing for it too). Again, I'm SO sorry for taking away a star, but rest assured -- there is NO taking away from Eder's star."
4,That voice....,"She undoubtedly has one of the best voices of any woman recording today. The songs are mostly showtunes done in the classic belt-'em-out style. Some have lyrics that are a little too cute (""Put a sign in Times Square, Get an internet address, baby-dot-com-turtledove""), and the Latin-flavored songs fall a little flat. Once in a while (the end of ""Havana"") the brass overwhelms, and the ""In one take"" Sinatra tribute ""One For My Baby"" is too unpolished compared to the rest of the disc. All that said, it's a good effort, and she still has that incredible voice."
3,"such a beautiful voice, such unflattering songs!","Linda Eder has such a beautiful voice but why does she have to sing all those awful songs. i was slightly dissapointed after purchasing this new album. the only songs i really like were ""Why Do People Fall in Love, Vienna, and Even Now."" i love ms. eder's voice and i love the way she sings on jekyll and hyde, but this collection of songs just dissapointed me. please please sing more things like ""Even Now"" that was the one song that i just found breathtaking."
2,What is this stuff???,"I have been folowing Linda Eder since she was with Paul Todd (another incredible talent) in the early 80's doing the night club act.Back then that girl could sing! I have a cassette that she and Paul Todd did together. The songs Mr. Wildhorn writes for her are nothing like the songs she and Todd wrote back then. I will say that vocally she is still a million steps above todays talent like Britney or Christina. Highlights on the new cd is the ballad Vienna, and the song This Time Around, which is one of those catchy songs you feel like you've known for years and can listen too 100 times and never get tierd of it. All in all she will never put out anything as good as her earliest stuff. But if you want to hear a huge set of pipes, Linda Eder will definitely not disappoint you."
5,Linda Eder rocks!,"I own this c.d., and it is what got me introduced to Linda Eder. She has the most amazing voice I have ever heard (male or female). ""Vienna"" is such an awesome song, and I can't believe how effortlessly she sings those high notes. I recently gained a high appreciation for the title track and ""This Time Around."" I also had the opportunity to see Linda in concert in Las Vegas. It was, without a doubt, the best concert I have ever been to. My good friend had the chance of meeting her, and said she was nothing but nice. ""Man of La Mancha"" is seriously my favorite of her's. It is so unblievable how big her range is. Hearing that and ""Vienna"" live was a dream come true. Especially the way she holds notes out for days. She never ceases to amaze me, and I can't wait to see her live again."
5,"If you have to buy one, buy this one!","I've been devouring Linda Eder's ""It's Time"" and ""No Secret"" since hearing her on NPR. ""No Secret"" is by far the better of the two. Being a singer I really appreciate her ability to deliver a song but what really makes this album are the arrangements and great musicians, Linda included. If you love the big band sound, updated, and great vocals this album HAS to be part of your collection. You won't miss and it'd make a super gift, too.PS - Eder is so phenomenal on CD that I've been stunned to see her in concert a few times now and with great disappointment each time. I'm sure she's great in a role on stage on Broadway, but connecting to the audience to her fans seems beyond her. She can learn this, she's a professional, and until that happens I won't waste that kind of money again - I'd much rather buy her albums. Her husband's arrangements are wonderful. Great team!"
3,Great Voice - bad songs,I like many others heard Linda Eder sing on Rosie. I immediately loved Vienna and also bought the album expecting more of the same type of songs as Vienna. Her voice is totally remarkable but the I just don't care for most songs on the album. It has to much of a jazz feel unlike vienna so I was disappointed. Hope future albums are better.
5,Breathtaking Talent!,"Linda Eder has amazing range and beautiful tones and phrasing. This CD demonstrates what an incredible singer she is! ""This Time Around"" shows here incredible power and the last note will blow your socks off! ""Vienna"" is gorgeous and shows her control. The orchestrations throughout this CD are breathtaking. All songs are original Frank Wildhorn songs played to perfection by an incredible band and sung to perfection by a talent that compares to (and in some cases exceeds)Barbara Streisand!"
5,Astonishing Vocal Showcase!,"The music on this CD literally sends shivers down the spine. Such is the power of Linda Eders, the most impressive female vocalist to come along in a long, long while. The songs, ranging from torchy ballads to broadway-style showstoppers are all sung with a sincerity and authority that puts her immediate peers in contemporary pop music to shame. Celine who?"
2,"That wonderful voice, those awful songs!","Linda Eder is an incomparable singer. Oft mentioned in the same sentences as Streisand and Garland, in truth her voice is gorgeously and utterly all her own. Imagine my dismay to pick up this new CD with its unoriginal (and unhummable) melodies and silly lyrics. Even if Frank had not run out of good tunes and Jack could think up something besides these June-Moon rhymes, it should occur to LE that to sing ANYONE'S songs ALL the time becomes somewhat boring. ""Even Now"" is lovely and ""Vienna"" is STILL lovely despite this pointless re-recording, but the ""up-tempo"" numbers are completely uninspired. Couldn't they have AT LEAST pulled out the terrific ""One Bad Habit"" which has never seen the light of day?"
2,Linda may need a career overhaul,"I have loved Linda Eder from the beginning, but ever since her last album ""It's Time,"" and even more so on this new one, the wonderful singer has become way too Vegas-like. I miss her softer side, which was at its best in the ""And So Much More"" album. Most of ""It's No Secret Anymore"" sounds like a really loud Las Vegas revue that Pia Zadora would do, albeit with a better voice. If Linda keeps recording songs like these, she is not going to get any new followers."
3,Somebody is not holding up his end in this Menage.,"I hate to be the skunk at the picnic and being a writer myself (in a different arena) I also hate to bust the chops of a fellow writer but I find the context of the lyrics in most of the songs in this album to be un-original, derivitive, and the rhyme schemes relentlessly predictable and cliche. Jack Murphy, the lyricist, did so much better in Linda's ""And So Much More"" album with his words to""I don't remember"" and ""Someone"". Wha' happen? While I admire Linda""s marital fidelity to hubby/composer Frank Wildhorn I just wish she's ""chippy"" around a little with Sondheim, Webber and Herman once in a while. She has such a magnificent voice -- I can imagine an incredible ""dream"" album with her hubby and those three."
1,Disappointment,"I heard Linda Eder sing VIENNA on Letterman when Kathy Lee was hosting. I sent for the CD and I was disappointed in the rest of the songs . Linda has a such a great voice, but the only song that lets you hear it well is VIENNA... very unfortunate."
2,Disappointment!,"The songs sound so generic. And as some others have pointed out, some of the songs sound so similar to ones on the previous CD.I don't think I'll buy another of her CDs, not that Linda Eder would care."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this album because of all the hype and rave reviews the consumers were giving it...comparing her to Streisand etc. Gimme a break. Linda's voice is ok but there is certainly nothing special or unique about her. Sorry folks, but this is a lounge act. I only hope I can get $2 for it when I trade it in!"
4,Can ROSIE make this woman more famous? As she should be!,"Now that Rosie O'Donnell has 'discovered' Linda, perhaps she will reach the height of popularity she deserves. This album has highs and lows as the other reviews point out but her voice is the draw, regardless of the songs she sings. EVEN NOW, THIS TIME AROUND, YOU NEVER REMIND ME.....they're all good but it is VIENNA that has endured. I was first given her self-titled album 10 years ago. It is hard to believe she is only just getting broad recognition. And have you noticed....she's also getting more beautiful!"
5,Exquisite!!!,"Linda Eder could sing ""Old McDonald"" and it would be glorious, what an incredible voice. I'm 34 and this is the first CD I've bought in my entire life! I even bought a cd player to go along with it! And 2 more of this CD as gifts. How lucky we are to have an entertainer like her to listen to. Bravo Linda! I can't go a day without listening to you!!"
3,A Linda Fan,"I have one question. WHY does she put more and moreupbeat numbers on her albums? In all fairness I really prefer her ballads and slower stuff but this album has too much moovin and groovin stuff. I always loved Vienna and still prefer the original version. I think they slaughtered that song. I think that the best songs on this cd are 'why do people fall in love' 'even now' and 'anything can happen' which I think showcase her voice much better than the faster songs. If you want and like slower and more romantic songs, go for the 'And so much more' cd, which remains my favorite to date."
5,Linda Eder is FANTASTIC!,"Linda Eder, not only being gorgeous, but has one of the most amazing voices of any artist today. You can't compare her to Celine Dion or Barbara Streisand because she is that much better. Her slow songs such as ""Why do people fall in love"" and ""Anything can happen"" have a real emotion you feel from her singing. Songs like ""Havana"" and ""Never Dance"" have a real Latin feeling that is a great addition to this CD. My favorite song though is ""You never remind me"". Linda is in excellent voice in all her songs but that one just sounded awesome to me. ""One for my baby"" is a great ending too. I would recommend this CD to anybody who likes music. If you like Linda on this CD, I also recommend her CDs ""It's Time"" and both ""Jekyll and Hyde"" versions. (I couldn't pick a favorite. Must have both!) Linda Eder is a talented singer and everyone should have this CD"
1,TAGALOG IS MY FIRST LANGUAGE THIS IS SIMPLY A BAD LANGUAGE BOOK,"I bought this book for my friend who wants to learn tagalog. However I decided not to give it and just return it to the store since it has a rediculous translation and interpretation of the tagalog phrases to the point of awkwardness. A tagalog speaker would find it funny to hear someone say some of the phrases in this book. This is not the way people in the Philippines talk in tagalog inside or outside the bedroom. I cannot now pinpoint where he got it right because I returned the book, but I am telling you, You will look stupid to be saying the phrases as how the author interpreted it."
4,This book could get you into trouble,An interesting selection of phrases not often found in phrase books. I would recomend it to anyone studying seriously and wanting to put some realism in their practice.
2,Uses Out of Date Tagalog,"I wanted to surprise my wife by learning a few new phrases in her native language so I got the book. She was pleasantly surprised on the first day and as the week went by wanted to know where I learned my new phrases. I gave her the book and as she looked through it she was shaking her head. She informed me that a lot of the phrases were ""old fashioned"", that modern Philippinos would not say things that way, only her grandfather's generation would. I had her give me a percent and she stated about 1/3 of the book seemed to be ""outdated"". She was not impressed with the book at all but at least I got few things out of it."
2,good content but.....,"The content of this book is good, but come on, it is smaller than a typical novel - and not even printed/covered as nicely as a hard back novel - and it sells for $110.00 - buy the paperback it is actually printed and covered in higher quality at 1/3 the price."
5,brain picks are non-slip,"The cool slider-type tin contains a dozen medium picks. The picks are outstanding, with a non-slip surface on both sides, so you can play hard even if you sweat hard!"
5,Crime and Punishment in America,"This book was required reading a sociology class I took and I would recommend it to anyone. The book is easy to read, easy to understand, interesting, and relevent to any member of society. Currie builds a strong thesis as to why our justice system does us little justice, and he offers some valuable suggestions as to how the system could do us more justice. I would especially recomend this book to all voters."
2,A contradiction in terms,"The title of this book is a contradiction in terms. There sure is a lot of crime in America, but where is the punishment? I mean, they never got the guy who killed Kennedy, did they?"
5,The Best of Chopin!,"Imagine being able to travel back in time to 1848 to hear Chopin's last concert in Paris! This CD takes you there with the same playlist, the same piano and a host of Polish performers who play their countryman Chopin's and other composers to perfection. This is a must-have CD for anyone who loves Chopin's music and other music of the Romantic Era. It represents some of the finest, even if not the best known, pieces written by Chopin and those pieces chosen by Chopin himself for his concert. For example, Chopin's Sonata for Cello and Piano in G Minor, B 160, Opus 65, Largo Movement is hauntingly beautiful and not often included in collections of Chopin's music. I know of no other Chopin CD that captures Chopin in his own time as well as this one and this concert in 1848, just a year prior to his death, speaks volumes for this great composer and his world."
3,Milosz ABC's,"the book was a bit of a disappointment. I love his poems but so far this book, after some browsing just sit on the shelf"
1,Do It Yourselfer,"When opening the shipping box, the multiple pieces had all come loose from their holders and lay rattling in the bottom of their box; spent a few minutes figuring out where the pieces should go and then couldn't figure a good way to hang it on my peg board and ended up stuffing it in my toolbox.Finally, the day came when I was going to tackle a job which required 4 screws to be installed in an almost 180 degree orientation from me - the whole reason I purchased this tool. (1) The multiple pieces fell out of the tool when I was using it inside a confined space - 30 minutes wasted in finding all of the pieces. (2) The locking mechanism for the tool bits needs to be pulled back to lock but trying to drive a screw in requires forward pressure which unlocks the attachment (3) The locking mechanism for the flexible shaft unlocked randomly on its own accord.Finally I gave up and used a thumb screwdriver to do the job; what an incredible waste of money and time."
2,Misleading tittle,"The Chronicles as presented by Penguin is nothing but a selection, something that cant be implied from the title. To make things worse, there appears to be no methodology for the selection of parts included, except the fact that the translator found them to be the most interesting."
2,Not so great,"I am very disappointed with this item. I ordered it for my 2002 Honda Accord. First, when I received it in the mail, it had scratches all over it and was more yellow than white. So amazon gladly exchanged it for me without hassle. About 4 days later, I received another one with no scratches BUT beware... It is NOT pearl white like the description says. Nonetheless it matched just enough so I installed them on my car. The result... Its been only 4 months and one light is already out now since I put them on. They were really bright, I must admit but they are only for showing off and not for use without headlights. I would not recommend this product to anyone because of the shotty craftsmanship and poor quality. I wasted my money on this poor quality product. I should've paid a bit more and got a better brand! Don't make the same mistake I did!"
5,Olympus Battery,The battery for my camera works great. I get a lot of photos with the back p batteries.
2,Battery life,Purchased two batteries for E-volt 500 camera six months ago - one is still holding a charge but the other was only good for a couple of months. Bought on the cheap - get what you pay for.
4,"Good price, works just fine.","I bought this battery as a backup battery to bring with me on vacation. The battery works well, although, I was only able to take about 320 shots with this battery (with the flash off, or using an external flash, and minimal review on the lcd), which seems to be about 70% the number I've been able to take with the Olympus brand battery.Overall, works good as a backup battery, but doesn't seem to last as long as the Olympus brand battery."
1,Defective When It Arrived,"When the battery arrived I put it my Olympus charger and noticed that the red charging light began to blink, indicating an error. After twelve hours, the red light was still blinking and the battery still would not charge. I returned this defective battery for a full refund and bought another brand which works perfectly."
5,Great option,When reviewing so many options with various price points I was unsure of which one to get. I ordered this one and have been using it and it charges and fits perfect in my E-510. It has been great to have a back up to ensure not running out right before the perfect shot.
3,king,This is a king size bed. It says in the description seems a lil pricey for me tho. So I wont be buying this bed
3,"Wow, all this in one movie?!","How can any one film combine martial arts, vampires, demon possession, East/West religious battles and debates about western underwear? Well, this one tries to! Don't let the three star rating undersell you -- it's a very fun, and a very funny movie. Battling vampires in a haunted church with neon crucifixes is always a good time! The fight scenes are outrageous, the demons are by turns pathetic and hilarious, and the WTF ending will have you asking, ""Sequel?"" Plus, the DVD comes with a free Exorcist Master t-shirt! Or, at least, mine did. Be the first on your block...this movie is sure to enliven any movie-night get-together with your friends. My buddies and I had a blast with it."
2,Disappointing.,Florence let Southerners down. This was almost trashy & I didn't get beyond the second chapter. I would not recommend it.
3,Lukewarm,"This collection of ""essays"" is amusing enough, but disappointingly unsatisfying next to the superb Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady, having nowhere near its level of wit and precision. I hesitate to really call these short pieces essays because they err too far on the side of memoir, and King just sort of shuffles around the point she wants to make in a rangy, rambling manner and then abruptly breaks off. Perhaps Confessions is superior because it is purely a memoir without the essayist aspirations, and King's real strength lies in clever storytelling. Her take on essays is far too topical, and for all her talk of being an intellectual, her theses are more often backed up by passing observations, a quote or two from popular culture (oddly, these often come from Phyllis Schlafly, with whom she seems mildly obsessed), and inventive stories about Aunt Beas and Miss MacEntyres than by any real scholarly research.Stick to storytelling."
5,ON POINT,"R & B lover man Gerald Levert is back with another slamming album.. He pretty much pick up where he left off with his last c.d touching on a wide range of topics.. from searching for love , to being hurt makes this cd on point.. The production is tight Darrell ""Delite"" Allamby unique choppy production style works well with Gerald..Favorite cutsApplicationCallin MeIt Hurts Too Much To Stay.(Feat Kelly Price).. This cut just blows me away UNBELIEVABLEMiseryShe Done BeenAre some of the highlights on a very good album"
4,Kicking Back with G,"When I brought this CD I was holding my breath and hoping that I would not feel as if I was losing my money, as in the case of many CD's you buy these days, you find 2 tracks you like and than you are ready to bury the CD, well with G, I was very pleased and not at all disappointed...to me this CD took off better with me than Love and Consequences did. Its a nice love cd if you are getting away from all the bumping, and just want to ease down to the love lane. My Favorites on the CD are She Done Been, Second Time Around, Nothin To Something, Mr. Too Damn Good, Don't Take It Away, to name a few. I feel that you won't be disapointed with this CD and feel that you will feel the emotions that Gerald Places into each of his song."
3,Still Doing It BIG,"Not one to remain stagnant or rely on past successes, Gerald Levert explores his vocal abilities on this set more than he has on past efforts. Outside producer Darrell Allamby captains the CD's first three tracks and stretches Gerald's voice; Allamby has him reaching for notes and provides fresh rhythms for G's soulful delivery, making the singer more acceptable to less mature ears. Gerald produces the next ten tracks and proves more adventuresome (with his voice) than Allamby by executing ""Baby U Are"" in falsetto. Allamby's tracks are phat, sure winners with ""Application,"" the stronger but slower ""Callin' Me,"" and ""Nothin to Somethin."" There's quiet storm fodder galore, including a smoldering duet with Kelly Price and the hitting ""Mr. Too Damn Good,"" written with ex-Rude Boy Joe Little."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED BY ONE OF YOUR SONGS,"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF GERALD LEVERT SINCE ROPE A DOPE STYLE. I THINK HE IS ONE OF THE BEST R&B VOCALIST THAT THERE IS. HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE OF THE QUEST CALLED LOVE, UP UNTIL NOW! THERE IS A SONG ON HIS (G)CD CALLED LOOKING FOR A NEW LOVE WHICH HE SAYS HE DOESN'T WANT A WOMAN WHO HAS KIDS. HE OF ALL PEOPLE WHO HAS THREE KIDS OF HIS OWN SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FOR SAYING SUCH A THING! I AM HIGHLY UPSET THAT HE FEELS THAT WAY! AFTER ALL I BET A LOT OF CHILDREN WERE CONCIEVED OFF HIS MUSIC. WELL, I MIGHT JUST BE ONE PERSON BUT I HAVE TALKED TO A LOT OF MY FRIENDS WHO ALSO ARE VERY UPSET ABOUT THAT LINE IN HIS SONG, AND WE ALL REFUSE TO PLAY THAT CD EVER AGAIN. REMEBER THIS MR. GERALD LEVERT, IT WAS A WOMAN WITH KIDS WHO BROUGHT YOU IN THIS WORLD, WHAT IF YOUR FATHER WOULD HAVE FELT THAT WAY, YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY! SO, UNTIL HE APOLIGIZES FOR THAT COMMENT, I REFUSE TO PLAY OR BUY ANOTHER ONE OF HIS CD! I AM NOT ALONE!!!"
1,G.is a GOAT,"now I think Gerald Levert is a Good Writer,Producer&vocalist but this Disc is 2nd Rate R.Kelly throwaways.the music sounds just like everything else that's out now.very Predictable."
4,Makes ALOT of sense - great help,"I was interested in electronics and robotics so I purchased this book. The flow of the book is a little choppy but I must say that the information helped me win high school science fairs and I am now studying electrical engineering at university! The support site is great and the author was very helpful. The well writen software projects I downloaded from the support site helped my dive into the project and allowed me to get a solid understanding of PalmOS, windows CE development, circuit fabrication and PIC programming. The project does required that you purchase a PIC programmer but if you are to pursue a career in robotics it is well worth it! Thank You!"
2,Good concept - poorly executed,"I really had high expectations for this book. I was looking for something that would provide an alternative to the PPRK-based ""Ultimate Palm Robot"" book. And this book does provide what appears to be a workable, if not very robust robot design that you can wirelessly link your Palm or WinCE PDA to. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the book is cut-and-paste data sheets - including some of the marketeering hype. This makes for a very disjointed read since the style of the book changes with each new data sheet and many concepts and terms are not explained well. As a result, this would probably be a difficult book for someone new to robotics. I'm still not sure that the schematic for the robot in this book was worth $20 - $30. I would suggest ""Programming and Customizing the OOPIC Controller"" by Dennis Clark as an alternative to this book. The OOPIC is easy to work with and the chapter describing interfacing the OOPIC to a Palm device is very well written."
3,good for beginner,"Not a bad book for beginners. If you expect bit more than a reprint of Microchip specifications (about 50% of the book) you can be dissapointed however.Why should I pay for something which can be freely downloaded from manufacturers website (like product specs.)?As well it is much better to include specifications and source code on CD, but then what is left from over 200 pages will be only enough for one good technical article.It is sad that such a good subject was only slightly touched in this book, but if you think that geting a taste only is enough for you, than go and buy this book and see for yourself."
1,Makes no sense.,"I had high expectations for this book, assuming that it would start out slow, with basic information, then pick up from there. This is far from the truth. The book slams you from the sixth page (literally) with seemingly irrelevant information about computer architecture, accompanied with confusing diagrams. As all of the other reviewers mentioned, the book is littered with a copied mismatch of pictures and diagrams. The book does not follow a logical thought process, nor is any of the information practical. Unless you have a BSCmpE, don't buy this book."
3,Excellent dance sequences but tedious story.,"I enjoyed the exciting dance sequences in the film. However, there were many extremely SLOW scenes in which we feel the film-maker is in love with her own image. I found it impossible to believe that an intelligent woman would find the macho, self-absorbed male lead attractive. If you love tango, you should get the video just for the dance sequences - fast forward through the rest!"
1,Tango Terrible,"Truly awful movie. I went to see it with a bunch of friends and we burst into hysterical laughter the moment we stepped out of the cinema. This pretentious one-woman ego fest was hard to swallow - Sally Porter acts, directs, dances and even sings, and does not improve the odds of making a good movie one bit by covering all fields possible. If she could play the cello she probably would have (thankfully Yo-yo Ma does the job beautifully). Strangely enough, the wanton lack of talent/ability did not prevent her from attempting any of the above. A painful experience. Attempt watching it only with your mother-in-law or bank manager, the world has enough suffering as it is."
1,Warning: This film contains self-indulgence,"Other than dance, I never expect much artistry from a dance movie. This movie failed to deliver even that. I was particularly disappointed as a long-time devotee of Argentine tango who was hoping to see great dancing. Aside from a tap dance sequence by Pablo Verón, the dance was pedestrian at best. The plot was trivial if not disjointed; the editing seemed random; the acting was amateurish as was the cinematography. In short this self-indulgent film, which I understand was produced to fulfill the fantasies of the principles, has little to offer the general public."
2,"Slow, average artistically, good dancing scenes","After hearing so much rave, I was rather disappointed when I finally got the opportunity to see it. The story line is thin and moves painfully slow. Artistically, the film is okay, but nothing breathtaking. However if you are a dance enthusiast, it is worth seeing at least once. If you are thinking of buying the soundtrack, don't bother; without the dancing to go along with the music, you won't be able to hold your attention long enough to listen to it."
1,Save your Money!!!,"If you're one of those who likes to see 'artsy' films for the sake of conversation, by all means check this oddball out. If, however, you want to watch a movie to be entertained or to appreciate Tango, be advised: This movie absolutely sucked. Potter was uninspiring and passionless, her love interest was self-centered and whiny, and what was up with the legless midget shooting horrific looking models in the color shots??? In a word, the whole thing was terrible. Even the Tango wasn't very good in this one (primarily as it was usually Potter dancing, and she obviously needs some more practice!)...the one redeeming factor was the music, which was outstanding. Particularly moving was Yo-Yo Ma's Libertango. Do yourself a favor...buy the CD, skip the movie."
2,3 minutes of good dancing,"Only one interesting dance scene - the Libertango. Everything else is total and complete nonsense. What a waste of talent - the dancers and the cinematographer! And, por favor, Sally, no more singing!"
4,Fixating from beginning to end,"This is a very stylistic film shot mostly in black and white. The early scene where Sally happens by a theater and first sees Pablo Veron perform the tango on stage shows Sally instantly fixated on the magic of Veron and the tango. The viewer of this beautiful, very personal film is likely to experience the same sense of awe and warm discovery throughout the film's entirety. The film's only weakness is the brief introduction of a strange religious connection between Pablo and Sally that is never successfully interwoven into the film's stylistic fabric."
3,The Tango Lesson,"I was abit disappointed and this film couldn't hold my attention. I do think it is a good intro to Tango though and the dance choreography is good. it was lacking in the storyline and I didn't feel anything in relation to the acting. However, the setting of the film is beautiful and the costumes and shoes, like the dancing was good."
4,Wish I could Tango,"The movie was very artistically passionate, compelling and engaging. I highly recommend it to all."
3,"Fantastic dancing, beautiful settings ... no substance","If you are studying argentine tango, you should absolutely look at this carefully. If you are curious about the ""tango scenes"" in Paris, Argetina & London ... this is your movie. Aside from that: the otherwise talented Ms Potter is a very flat actress [I would have loved to see someone else in this role] and the weak use of Tango as a metaphor for control in other things ... is labored and lacking in depth. But the dancing, settings and music are superb."
5,One of the best movies I've ever seen,"If you like international movies, dance, great music and all that goes with it you will LOVE this movie! The Tango Lesson is about a woman who becomes fascinated with learning the Tango...in Paris and Buenos Aires. And she finds the perfect teachers. I never realized that there is so much to the Tango...it's much more than you typically see. And Sally Potter is simply wonderful...and by the end of the movie you want to know more about her. Is this autobiographical? Or just a fantasy? I have watched the movie three times and am now going to purchase it....it's that wonderful!"
1,This version is a rip-off,"The Tango Lesson is a wonderful movie. I tried to buy a DVD to share with a friend, and the one I got from Amazon had NO subtitles. This film uses three different languages. There was no disclaimer on Amazon that the version I was buying had no subtitles. I didn't find out until the friend received the DVD and said he couldn't enjoy a movie that he couldn't understand. Shame on you, Amazon."
4,Good Deal,"The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because of the way the menu is set up for the dvds. They are confusing and you can not select a play all option that exactly works. Other than that this is a great deal compared to other Little Einsteins dvds that I have seen. My son is obsessed with the show and this is a nice way to have the show at all times with out having to remember to set it up to record, etc. The packaging and quality of the dvds are great."
5,soft case....hard egg,"I enjoy all the features of this item.The main compartment that hold the camera is soft and secure. You can open it without worrying about your camera falling off.The back compartment is roomy enough for all the basic gear. The slot for memory cards 1-4 (depends on the card type), batteries (roomy for four AA), and cables can fit in it.The shoulder strap is basic and looks flimsy. It's not long enough to hold comfortable diagonally but on the side is good. The belt loop is very secure and can fit on belt three inch in width.It can even handle the worst environment ever. Hot, dry climate with sandstorms and occasional accidental drops. It has protected my dig. camera very well."
3,Just a bunch of recipes,"The title of the book is misleading. I'm new to smoking and wanted a book that gave me some insight into the overall process and various methods. There are a handful of pages on such topics, then the rest of the book is just recipe after recipe. Now, if that's what you are looking for, then the book is great - it does have lots of interesting ideas. But, there is precious little ""how to"" in this how to book."
4,smoking,my husband loves this book. he has a wood smoker and he got an electric smoker this summer and has been trying new things and this book has given him alot of new ideas.
4,Like smoked food ?,It is a nice cookbook for the price and the knowledge you can pick up from the smoking tables and brines that they show. The only reason it got 4 stars was the meat section seemed very limited for my tastes. Is the cookbook worth purchasing for a beginner ? Yes ...if for nothing more than the various tables for smoking times etc..
2,"Smoking, not with this book","HiThis book was disappointing. Looking for temp and length of smoking times, as well as, best flavor of chips to use for various foods and nuts.Thank you"
4,Great recipes.,Easy to read and great recipes. Well organized and written. Even for an experienced cook this is a great book full of super tips.
5,We now love classical music!,"As a homeschooling mom I want my children, 2yrs and 14yrs to get the best education. I include music appreciation with their other school work. Both of the girls and myself love hearing classical music in this format. It gives us background and allows our imaginations to run wild listening to the music and stories. My 2 yr old will just lay in her bed and listen to the cds for an hour! She will get up and dance to the lively sequences. I didn't care for classical music nor did I have an opportunity to listen to it in the public school I attended. Thank you Classical Kids Collection for providing fun, learning and an appreciation for classical music to myself and my children."
2,Very thick inner tubes ...,"I bought 4 of these, all 4 of them had defective valves. Air would not go in except when supplied under high pressure (gas station) and then seemed to leak very slowly too. Bad batch? Bought some cheap tubes, swapped out the valves, no problems now."
2,Bowdlerized Flood Story,"This is a cutesy version of the Noah story that completely removes the point of the biblical narrative. In this version, God gives no reason at all for sending the flood (in fact, he didn't even send it), and nobody dies. When the ark arrives, Noah prays to thank God for a shiny, clean earth. And the rainbow means ""I love you."" It has nothing to do with the rest of the story. So much for divine justice and amazing mercy.If you really think the truth of the biblical story is too unpleasant for a two-year-old, perhaps it'd be better to wait until they're old enough to tell them the real story, rather than give a distorted image of God's character."
5,Great Book!,"My daughter is 15 months old and loves this book! We have been reading it just about every day since we got it when she was 4 months old. The illustrations are great and the words are very simple. I was looking for a book about Noah that was simple but informative and this is it! Try other Patricia Pingry books also, they are great!"
2,Dias de Boda,"I had a headache after watching it. The camera keep moving around to focus on someone who was talking, could have probably done it with a wider shot. It just reminded me of someone who recieved their first video camera! The audio is poor, I had the volume all the way up to 65 (which is max on my TV).About the story, to say the least it was very bizzare to me. The guy is gay and he's getting married to advance his career. That in itself is not strange, happens all the time. But the thing between the groom and the bride's father was weird. And, them doing coke in the bathroom....totally bizzare. And the grooms, lover at the wedding! And the grandparents that weren't invited to the wedding. Ok, stange scene. Poor girl....So, I start every movie with as a 5 star, then discount. Poor audio, crazy video recording, and strange story."
1,Can't get it to work,"I don't recomend this product, I can not find a station on mycar radio that will allow me to listen to my ipod music. This is the third one I have purchased and none of them work in South Florida..."
3,"Good deal, so so quality","Pros: Great price for having both a car charger and a FM transmitter. For the most part, works as expected.Cons: The car charger part is assembled poorly. We have had two of these and both broke the same way. The wire that is inside the charger part snaped when we pulled it out of the lighter socket.I would still recommend it as a good affordable choice."
4,Better than the rest!,I've had this model for about a year and yes it has some breakage problems but still works well. I went out and bought a different brand for my dad and the transmitter was twice as much and worked half as well.
4,"Great bargain, I like it","After 1 month of use, I must admit that I like the product. While it is true the unit is bulky, I have not experienced any issues with the unit's performance --as a matter of fact it has performed beyond my expectations. The sound is great, it functions better than average, it's a flat-out bargain. The negatives are the cords, they can get tangled easily and the bulkiness of the unit. Minor flaws in my opinion."
5,This is great.,This is a great transmitter.A little bit big than I expected but has nice reception and sound quality is good.
5,Most excellent.,"After reading other reviews, I knew this is the transmitter I had to have. I did expect the FM quality and so forth, but what I got was ten times better. With a little adjustment of the bass/treble on my car stereo, the sound is just like having a CD in the player. Granted, I do have to turn the volume up a bit more than usual, but that's easily acceptable considering the problems I've had with other transmitters. (For instance, the Belkin I had that basically just transmitted static with a melody.)I love it and highly recommend it!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my 5g Ipod. I drive a late model Subaru with the lighter switch inside of the ashtray console. Firstly the transmitter was completely dangerous to operate while driving. Its impossible to use in Park and Neutral in my car. The controls are bulky. The transmission cut out in mountains, on hills, and on the highway whenever I drove over 60mph resulting in my ipod starting and stopping because it shakes and wobbles in the console. In short, it hardly worked and I was afraid to touch it while driving, lest I'd knock my gear shift out of place. Its cheaply made and all in all a complete piece of junk.This is hands down the worst IPOD FM transmitter I have ever used. I've previously used a basic Kensington all in one model (stolen by wife, worked well but awkward) and ended up replacing this with a far superior Griffin Road Trip. I reccommend spending the extra $15 on the Road Trip."
3,Broke in half,Overall it is a good product. Mine broke in half when I tried to take it out of the cigarette charger. I reconnected the wires and fixed it. If someone can answer my question: The red LED light on the charger is now always on once I put it into the cigarette charger - is that the case? I cannot remember what it was like before I broke it.Thanks
1,Sounded like complete crap through my car stereo,"I have the premium sound system in my Explorer and any station I chose, the sound was like mono FM. TERRIBLE fidelity, unlistenable almost. I will give it another test with some other frequencies, but if that don't work I am sending it back immediately."
4,Good but not perfect,It was a good product but didn't work perfect. you need to hold the transmitter close to the radio.
2,Expected better,"I had expected to do some sanding prior to finishing the chair. I did not expect to find large splinters on the arms that needed to be removed, and gouges in other parts. Overall you can do better for the money."
4,"Good mystery, fun characters","This is a mystery novel set in Britain around 1934 (which is when it was written). The mystery was clever, and the world-building and pacing were very good.The author introduces a lot of the characters quite rapidly at the beginning, but it's clear how everyone is related to each other. The characters were all engaging and entertaining. There is a good-natured humor to the book which shows up in the dialogue and in the quirks of the various characters.There were plenty of clues to this mystery. It's quite possible to guess the who and the why, and yet at the same time you're not likely to guess correctly. (As in, it's the perfect balance of being guessable without being too easy.)There were two uses of very mild cuss words. There were no sex scenes. Overall, I'd rate this as good, clean fun.Genre Reviewshttp://genrereviews.blogspot.com/"
3,Conventional Comedy of Manners Mystery,"I really like turn-of-the-century British drawing-room mysteries, and this fit comfortably into that category. The mystery was good, the ending a nice 'twist', and the writing very good. However, I felt that the storyline was trite, and the characters - even the 'good guys' - were unlikeable or vapid.Verdict - this was not one of Ms. Heyers' best efforts. The writing was good, but the story was conventional and the characters painted in black & white.Note on Kindle formatting: Only OK - there were multiple instances of words run together, and inconsistency in hypenenated last names (sometimes they were hyphenated correctly, other times they were run together with both names capitalized)."
3,Great screwdriver only for certain jobs....,"This is a great screwdriver for it's price. I wasn't expecting it to be so bulky but it is rather heavy for a screwdriver. I use it around the house and for certain projects, but for regular use I prefer my 5 in 1 screwdriver."
2,"Should be titled ""In Search of Permits""","Clifford does a good job of alternating between the story of Captain Kidd and his own search for Kidd's flagship. But far too much of the book is dedicated to a long, boring rendition of Clifford's dealings with the local authorities, his rival ship hunter and the resulting phone calls and meetings required to secure permits for the excavation of the ship. Over 90 percent of the modern portion of the book reads like: ""Then I called the President's daughter. Then she called me back. Then we met with the minister of the Interior. He told us to come back the next day. So I rode a bike around the island. The next day we called the President's daughter again...."" The politics is simply filler so that he wouldn't be selling a 50 page book. To summarize -- there are many books that are a better use of your time."
2,the cicero spy affair,I was interested more in the actual actions that concentrated on Cicero. This book is more of a history lesson on German polotics in WWII
3,Good for small infants,I bought this bed to use for my 5 month old while we were camping. It is a nice product but didn't work quite as i had hoped - at least for us. My baby likes to roll around a lot when he sleeps so he felt restricted in this small space and ended up waking up throughout the night. The bottom of the bed doesn't have very much padding either.I think it probably would work well for newborns. Although it was a good place to put the baby down for naps and just to put him when we needed to do something and didn't want him rolling of the bed of the camper.
4,you cannot blame the ball!,Along with Nike Platinum works very well for me; I am not an expert but I believe 12 thru 25 handicappers should enjoy using this ball.
3,Pointless read..,"After I bought this book I was hell bent on reading, learning, and being the most prepared I ever could be for a deployment. Well I read some it and could not read it anymore. I didnt find it very useful through any of the deployment. It may work for some but for me it was pointless."
1,Seen Better Days,"I subscribed to this mag years ago and the standard is dropping sadly with opinionated cookie cutter ""DJ Advice""Best bet? Join an online forum and ask questions"
2,Overrated Magazine,"Overrated magazine. Offers a first look at new and exciting products; however, it is not to critical on these reviews since these are future advertising dollars it would be losing from harsh or honest reviews. Everything can't be great."
1,Find Something Else,"This product will suffice if you're in a pinch, but I cannot recommend it. When working with short hair I prefer to have a gel that is less thick and slightly more malleable. This gel is really rough to work with when you're trying to achieve any kind of a messy look. It's perfect if you have super short hair that will all be going in one direction, and you don't need to add any creativity to the matter. But if you have slightly longer hair, and you want to play with it--this gel is quite bad for that. For super tight spikes this works, for essentially anything else--it doesn't."
3,unfair to ali,"it is a interesting book and a good read but i dont believe everything in it, i think kram didnt like ali personally. Bill Simmons and David Halberstam thought kram wasnt fair to ali either but they thought it was a good book for most part. I saw ali being surprised by fraziers appearance on 1978 show ""This is your Life"" and ali was genuinely happy to see him so despite his meanness preceding fights i think ali had a genuine respect for such a great warrior and maybe Joe did too for ali near end of his life. I dont know how they fought 14 rds in such heat. It is hard to see ali now and the late Joe Frazier had brain damage too, it seems insane ali kept fighting after manila. If he had retired after epic foreman fight i bet he would be in better shape now. Joe is awaiting ali in valhalla and hopefully they will be brothers in afterlife."
3,Great story undone by style,"I did enjoy reading this book (I finished it in about 3 days), but the interesting information put forth by the author is often obscured by the writing style. First of all, there is too much moving around in time. Second, the author tries too hard to be literary, to the point where some sentences I had to read 2 or 3 times to try to interpret. It doesn't bother me at all that the author dares to deconstruct the Ali myth. I just wish the information was presented in an easier to read format."
1,Don't waste your time,"As a enthusiastic boxing fan, I was excited about reading a detailed account of probably the greatest heavyweight bout in modern boxing history. What I got was a writer who no-doubt has a very high opionion of his grasp of the english language. He certianly wasted no opportunity to remind to reader of it. In the end, his sophomoric writing style ruined an excellent opportunity to shed light on one of the greatest rivalries between two human beings. ..."
1,Poorly written.,"The editor of this book did not do his or her homework. It almost seems like a first draft written while the author was aloft on booze. The pages are filled with multisyllabic words, and grand sentences that if picked apart are not grammatically correct and often are meaningless. More significantly, when you plow through the prose all the reader discovers is that Ali has been aggrandized and Frazier is bitter at how Ali portrayed him. Is this news? At the end there is a section about a seldom heard about lover/wife of Ali which revealed a bit more about Ali's past than I'd known, but overall this was not a very well written or informative book. I bought it because I remembered the article Kram had written after the Manila fight for SI. That article was great. This book is not."
3,The Thrilla from Vanilla...,"Muhammad Ali has received hagiographical treatment for the past thirty years or so. This book has a different perspective, however. Kram was there the whole time, saw everything, knew everybody, and lays out his take, to use an apt metaphor, without pulling any punches. Kram does occasionally lose himself in pretension--using the word ""rodomontade"" in a boxing book?--but, hey, he was an old guy, close to death, and I guess he wanted his last work to be more profound than the subject matter permitted. For everyone who thought Ali was a keen intellect, or a political visionary, or, indeed, a saint, here is your bucket of cold water. He certainly was a talented athlete--a heavyweight with the speed of a middleweight--and he may have been a symbol of pride to blacks...but that's about it."
2,Better off buying separate quality pieces,"Bought this kit on the strength of the first review, but was disappointed by quality after repeat usage. The brush fell apart on the first use (nails fell out) and rusted in one week. The drop cloth was too thin and flimsy to be at all useful, and the thread in the large roller handle is so worn after painting 3 rooms that it can no longer be used with an extension pole (by contrast, a roller bought 5 years ago and used with heavier primer still sits tightly on the extension pole). The only items I can still use out of this kit after 3 rooms is the pan (for which I bought pan liners separately) and the smaller roll (used lightly)."
5,"Nice, just what I wanted",The words of Jesus presented in several formats.... I just wanted to have the red words all in one book and this one suits me just fine!
1,Over rated,"I plugged in the new compressor and it couldn't get itself goingAfter a few tries it started, but then couldn't start again afterthe pressure dropped to the restart pressure.It also got very hot.I returned it and in short order got a replacement. It worked fine for a few days, but then started to overheat and would shut off. It had to cool down for quite awhile before it would start, then it would over heat and shutoff. Summary: over rated, under powered, poorly designed. Couldn't keep up with my hardwood flooring stapler, much less two guns going at thesame time. I got a very good Dewalt that I am very happy with,and a lot less money."
5,awesome compressor,"light, quiet and reliable, oil free makes it low maintenance, can't say enough good things about it, highly recommend it to anyone and amazon's prices can't be beat. 1 year review: The Thomas compressor is still running as strong as the day I bought it, running two finish guns at the same time without any problems, by far the best compressor I have ever owned, I wish I had known about them before I wasted my money on other brands in the past, you definitely get what you pay for and although they might seem expensive they are worth every penny."
2,An unconvincing plot,"This is a reprint of a long-forgotten mystery which would better have been left forgotten. The book's two strong points are its sense of atmosphere and the character of the detective. Its drawbacks are (1) the murder method is extremely dubious--cyanide does NOT kill instantly with the victim making no sound, (2) the chief female character, supposedly a mature woman, acts in such an adolescent manner as to engender a desire to kick her rather than any sympathy and (3) the solution is more or less sprung on the reader."
2,An Undistinguished Effort,"As the previous review notes, the publisher of the series in which this book appears is on a mission to reprint long-forgotten mysteries. This one should have stayed forgotten.Specifically, the characters are undeveloped, the method of killing is both unlikely and scientifically dubious, the denoument is sprung with little advance support and the chief female, instead of being sympathetic, acts in such an adolescent fashion as to make one want to smack her."
2,"You won't find this on my ""Regional Book"" shelf","Here's what the jacket says: ""Dan Fortune, the one-armed private detective of the Edgar Allan Poe Award-winning Michael Collins novels ... returns with his most provocative, brilliantly realized adventure to date."" Well, I don't know about that. This was the first (and it will be the last) Dan Fortune novel I've read. I don't know how Dan lost his arm - unlike many series, remedial background information is not provided. The current adventure involves progeny of the VietNam Conflict.I ordered this book because I thought it might be about Minnesota. Who knew that the Minnesota Strip is in New York City?! And probably not a destination for most tourists. ""Sudden death was as ordinary on the Minnesota Strip as whisky and heroin and pimps' Cadillacs."" It's a grim place and a grim book.Does anyone out there know how this area of NYC got its name?"
5,"My daughter now says ""Thank You God"" when reading any book!",Very sweet book. Rhymes are easy to memorize (which will happen after reading it enough) and the pictures are darling. The characters are diverse (not just white blonde children but a great diversity of races). My child loves this book (age two) and it has helped us teach her to be thankful in every circumstance (as the book models so well). Children and animals also help my daughter learn vocabulary - so much to the animations - extremely well done.
1,Bad prose bad photography,"If you are looking for flat black and white pictures of birds held by a person's hand with uninspired prose accompanying the bad pictures, this is the book for you.If you are expecting stunning pictures of birds with lucid prose, look elsewhere. Without question, the worst book of bird photography I have every seen."
5,Stunning in every sense,"This book is stunning in every sense. A beautiful collection of bird photographs, interesting & insightful essay, with classic yet modern design marrying the two. Schrager & Byatt make a stellar combination. This book clearly illustrates the delicate interaction between man and nature. I think this book should appeal to many different individuals-- fans of Schrager's work, fans of Byatt's work, those interested in photography, as well as the birding population in general. I loved it!"
1,Big disappointment,"I respect the right of an artist to make a statement in his own way, but I also feel his audience has a right to reject that statement. These pictures are amateurish and unattractive. The birds, which in nature are beautiful and free, seem dull and and sad, imprisioned by a faceless humanity. If this is the message Schrager is trying to express, he succeeds, but I do not want these images in my library."
3,Great book but needs a little more update,"If you brought one already, don't buy the following year, I noticed majority of it was just reprinted. They really need to go back and review the schools because some phone number and information of the school has changed."
3,An uncaged version of raw talent for a first time author!,"This book bares it all in seven chapters-I suspect the first chapter captures certain facts of reality, one of which portrays curiosity as a process that often leads to some discovery. In this book, 'self-discovery'.The 7 chapters metaphorically put as 7 seasons, reveal attractive stages of John Nicodemus, the main character's life.It boldly engraves Scripture to drive home points, but what interested me most were these chapters-''the gold merchant's story', 'mystery of the wedding ring, spider like and rainbow kingdom'.The authors have great promise and are deep thinkers."
5,Thank God! for books like this that save our youth!,"I read it and i liked it. Though the writers are upcoming, they passed on strong messages and gave rare wisdom to us all."
4,lovely music,"This is a lovely story that incorporates beautiful music. Other than the more common defaming slant of Morganne, the story is well told and my 6 year old enjoys it greatly."
4,Great CD,"This CD is very good musically and lyrically. Has very great talent! Luny Tunes are very good producers and if you have bought other CD's by them and you are not that impressed I would say go ahead and get this one, this is what Luny Tunes is really all about, great dancing reggaeton."
3,En mi caso es otra perdida de dinero...,"Bueno en verdad pienso q esto esta medio ridiculo, pero no se... cada cual tendra su razon. Este cd es practicamente el mismo cd de Mas Flow 1 q salio hace 2 años... la unica diferencia es que le cambiaron las caratulas, le quitaron el nombre de ""Noriega"" de la caratula, y trae el dvd de Mas Flow que han vendido por separado. Si pagastes los 15 pesos por el cd de Mas Flow cuando salio, y pagastes 15 pesos pal dvd... ni te atrevas gastarlos aqui... Pero, si nunca comprastes el cd o el dvd, pues es una tremenda inversion y ahorro..."
5,a great cd... now even better,"I love the fact that they decided to put out a platinum edition of Mas Flow, it makes the album even better with the addition of the free dvd, so go out and get this album cause it's hot. and look out for Mas Flow 2 coming out this spring."
4,Mas Flow is a Very Clever CD,"The Artists on Mas Flow are the cream of the crop from Puerto Rico, and I really liked the CD. There is a new CD/DVD package coming out on entitled Ragga Nacion which features new songs from Nico Canada (The Noise), The Dream Team, T-Quest, General Degree, and many others. It also has many of the original hit songs that started the Reggaeton movement. It covers 1987-2004, so there is something for everyone. Amazon will have it on Oct. 12, and you can preview it at www.ragganacion.com before you buy. I got a preview copy from the Producers, and I really liked it, and that is why I wrote this review, and a couple of others."
5,REPLACEMENT,"LOST OUR ORIGINAL 1.SO HAD TO ORDER ANOTHER 1.SO I PICKED 1 THAT WORKED FOR ME & MY PUP.WELL WE FOUND OTHER 1, SO HAVE 2, JUST IN CASE"
2,Has this for a long time,"This is a pretty good cot, but alot of the time, the tent part falls off and doesn't do too well in wind or rain. A person would be much better off with a dog igloo and a dog house."
2,Poor Picture,"Everything about the Concert was great with the exception of the extremely poor picture. The picture was unfocused and fuzzy. During Billy's bass solo the brightness from the spotlight washes out the picture ... so much so you really can not see what he is playing. The DVD is packaged in a CD jewel case and sounds great. However, I would recommend purchasing a CD over spending the money for the DVD due to the poor picture."
3,Yawn.,"The setting was vividly imagined and realistic, but everything seemed too slow or too fast. If you particularly like this period of history, then you may enjoy this book, but the pacing -- first too fast, then too slow, then too fast -- made it hard for me to get through despite my initial enthusiastic interest in its premise."
3,Read the product description...,"The first bullet point: It says ""Argyle tank top spring and summer 2011 clothing collection for small dogs.: HahahaDont know if your dog would like to wear lizard food (especially if it's last year's trends ;)"
2,BEARDIES BEWARE,"First time using dried foods for the beardies, found that this product was a waste of money. i have two beardies with 2 completely different eating habits and neither would pay attention to it. they love the other dried food i bought by a more popular brand with dried mealworms and crickets, they eat that all day but this is just pellets like you feed the chickens at the zoo. poor quality and no attrative smell for them."
1,Worthless,Poor quality and design and really a complete waste of money. Don't waste your time with this item...get a Walkers.
2,Le Dix by Balenciaga wonderful fragrance however I found mine Cheaper at,Le Dix by Balenciaga is a wonderful fragrance and when I wear this I always recieve many compliments however I found mine CHEAPER at thefragrancefactory.com
2,Arditti knows too much about the violin to play Cage,"I have a real problem with Arditti doing Cage. I think when you consume your entire life with goal-oriented,incessant goals toward an aesthetic object, how is it possible to think in an oppositional way without some time lapse, some retreat into Zen to really feel the spatial time. Given these Freeman Studies puts a hold on Cage's more traditionally beautiful Zen excursions, still how do we appraise them then. A raw unhihibited virtuoso display, non-conceived abstraction for the pure spirit of what??. I find Arditti cold and uninspired. He is a consummate quartet leader and should remain one. What is required I think in performing Cage is you always need to consider the full Cage, and not a frationalized one with a one-dimensional cast."
4,Smashed Box - great nails,I receieved the box in 3 days. Great shipping speed. However the box was smashed on one end and most of the coils had to be reformed to fit in the gun. Besides having to reshape the coils the nails themselves fire great with my new Bostich nailer. Have had no misfires after about a dozen coils and no half sunken nails. All in all they are great nails but i would buy them locally if i could find them to avoid the outrageous $30 shipping charges
3,Bostitch Roofing Coil Nails,"I needed to do a New Roofing Job for my Daughter. A 10' by 12' outbuilding. I purchased Roofing Nails, thinking I would get plenty to do the job. WOW! I got enough to go into Business. An option should have been offered for a small amount, at least by half. 7,200 is a LOT of Nails"
3,Simple and sweet,"This doll was issued a few years ago, but I thought it was simple and sweet, were most of Barbie Bride dolls are elaborate this one is sweet and simple a nice change."
3,Eurotrash,The singing is glorious except for Baron Ochs who is miscast a bit because his voice is not right for the lecher and country bumkin that he is supposed to be. The main problem is that the opera is done mostly in modern dress and it completely destroys the mood and feeling of being in 18th century Vienna. Does Austria still have field marshals and princesses living in palaces? The servant is an adult in blackface in a clown outfit. The MEt does it better and I look forward to its production on DVD-also with Fleming.CSL
1,WAY Overpriced,"These are two basic BNC extender cables - Male to Female (Panel Mount on female side). A very quick googling got me a price of $12 a cable, if you can solder then it's probably less than half that. I'm betting for them it's about 600-800% markup over production cost for a product that must have taken a 10 minute phone call to get produced by their supplier - thanks a heaping pile, Sennheiser."
1,Too expensive,"I haven't read this book yet, but I would really like to... But at $58.00 I don't think I will be reading it any time soon.Real Spiritual knowledge should be free or at the very least at list price. At $58.00 or higher I seriously doubt the validity of the spiritual knowledge that it is supposed to contain, and it seems to me as though these people are trying to gouge us."
5,Pretty Coaster,They look much better when they arrive. The picture is not a good representation of how nice looking these coasters are. They are expensive but I think they are worth it.
4,The Immune System for First Year Medical School Immunology,"Brand new. Great book. Has very clear pictures that were useful supplements to lecture. You could read this relatively quickly if you so choose. Allow two weeks for this book to arrive, though."
4,Good Book,This is a good basic immunology book. Easy to understand (even if your background in immunology is minimal). I will definitely hold on to this book for reference.
3,Nice,The book is in acceptable condition with only highlight on it. This is the textbook that could be keep for later use.
1,Worse condition than described.,Book came in much worse condition than described. Pages are falling out and nearly everything is highlighted.
5,Best immunology book!,"This is the best immunology book out there for the aspiring medical student. Well written, easy read, concise. During the first years of medical school you need sources that deliver information in a quick, organized manner and this book delivers! Don't think about any other immunology textbook."
3,Geometrical Illustrations of Fourth Dimension,"Living in a world of three dimensional space makes it hard for us to conceive fourth dimension and it gets even harder to visualize the fifth and higher dimension. Superstring theorists predict the existence of 10th and 26th dimensions in universe; hence it seems reasonable for many of us to understand how it would be like to be living in fourth dimension. Thomas Banchoff is one of the leaders in the study of higher dimension using computer graphics; he has illustrated fourth dimension using basic geometrical approach such as slicing the spatial dimension, observing the shadows of structures, comparing the folded and foldout versions of polytops and description of configuration of spaces. This book is useful for someone who appreciates geometry, but for a reader who likes to visualize the fourth dimension he/she may read Clifford Pickover's Surfing through Hyperspace, which does a better job in illustrating fourth dimension."
2,THIS ALBUM STINKS I WAS NOT SUPRISED AT ALL !,"THE BEATS ARE OK.I'M JUST NOT FEELIN THEIR GAME AT ALL.THIS GROUP OF RAPPERS SHOULD BREAK UP AND GO SOLO.HERES THE OK TRACKS THAT I LIKE 9,10.THERE'S PROBABLY MORE BUT I DON'T LIKE ANY MORE.DON'T BUY THIS."
4,Good but not the best,"this is definitely a solid album, but not the best in a while. there are some very weak tracks on there. This collab. is probably not even as good as Ruff Ryders. Pun and Cuban carry this album. ""Armegittyon"" is ready to shine, but for the entire Squad to really shine Sies and Prospect need to pick it up. I have heard them both sound tighter i.e., ""capital punishment"". The hidden gem waiting to shine will be Cuban when his album drops. By the way this is honest review from a latino not a nut huggin praise job, peace"
4,This album is hot!,"the Terror squad album is tight! eveyone needs to get it. cuban and armagittyon really show their skillz on here. there are maybe 2 that are kinda weak, but it is a definite buy, u wont waste your money."
2,Terror Squad? Never Squad,"This album was a big disappointment to the tenth degree. With great artist like Pun, Fat Joe, and Cuban they could have came out with something a whole lot better than this trash. they only had one slammin track to me, Watcha Gon Do, and that was killed in video and radio play. They have 16 tracks but only a hand full of decent tracks. If you are a die hard fan of terror squad but if you are just seeing if they are going to recreate the magic they had on Pun's and Joe's last albums then leave this on the shelf and wait for the next album"
4,CAME OUT SWINGING!,"Yo Fat Joe and the ""T Squaders"" debut album ""Terror Squad"" ranks right up there like the release of the ""Xbox""/It's ahead of it's time/Released in '99/Big Pun,Triple Seis,Cuban Link and Prospect/""In For Life"" causing shockwaves like forks in electrical sockets/It's a ""Triple Threat""/Doubledare you to try to rip it next/Armageaddon,Prospect, and Big Pun have you ""Feeling This""/It's true/Terror Squad paid dues and have cat's shook like having to go to the bathroom - Dimpals a.k.a ""Leroy"""

3,Book is better,"Flat and hurried compared to the book. My children were disappointed. The visual part was entertaining. Also, there are modern ideas in the movie that weren't in the book, namely an attempt to equalize all religions."
3,Good Movie,It's a good movie if you don't mind reading subtitles. The movie was shot in the Polish language so if you want english you have to read it in the subtitles.Still it's a good movie thats shot in beautiful locations.
3,C'mon...don't believe the hype,"This album is average at best. Those who compared it to ""perfecto presents another world"" are out of their minds. The mixing is good...but the choice of tracks are not exactly top notch. Seriously...for how many years are we going to hear the super played out U2 Beautiful Day track.Don't expect an epic release by any means because it is not even close."
2,Could have been much better.,"My friend had bought this awhile ago when he and I were looking at the tracklist. At first we thought it was pretty sweet looking as we were familiar with just about every tune on there, even the latest Young Parisian track ""Jump the Next Train"". Both of us were quite disappointed with Paul Oakenfold's mixing. Transitions were always very brief and at a specific part of the track outros like an amateur DJ following a formula. It's not the worst thing Oakenfold has done by far. It's at least a bit better than ""The Great Wall"". Some may say I'm being too critical. I think I'm just spoiled by real DJs like Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, Markus Schulz, Gabriel & Dresden, DJ Tiesto, etc.I expected much better from Paul after being in the business for this long. This sounds like a mix of mine when I first learned how to beatmatch and mix on my own turntables. If you're reading this, you're better off getting Armin van Buuren's A State of Trance mix."
2,La involución,"Previsible. No evoluciona. Le salva de la ""estrella solitaria"" que mezcla a la perfección pero los temas elegidos lo hacen soso, sin carácter. Lo escuchas sin que te llegue a emocionar. Bluf!."
2,i knew i should have stayed away from oakenfold,The mix has no logical progession it feels like he just put songs in rather than mix songs together. .
1,gave it a shot,"I tried and tried to get into this album...it just sucks! Nothing that really hooks you...has no energy! Frankly, Oakenfold does not impress me at all. I suggest...Kleinenberg, AVB, and Gielen!"
5,Encyclopedic,I have practiced cooperative learning in Elementary Statistics for sophomore prior to read Millis and Cottel's book. The book confirms the best practices for that subject particulary in chapter seven. What can be suggested is to include more one way of team formation: use Kolb's Learning Style Inventory. It actually does work. Details like the extra topic or extension activities for groups that work more rapidly than others demonstrate that the authors have practical experience about some problems to overcome.
4,Persona 4 thoughts,It should be in english dub when ever it comes out but i hope they can get the same actors from the game or at least make it sound close to the game. I cant wait until it comes out!
1,Lazy and cheap to only include the dub.,"Returned this as soon as I realized there was no Japanese language track. This isn't a budget release, release a quality product."
5,Fantastic,"This is a testament to how animation should be localized. The voice actors do an absolutely fantastic job, and are largely the same voice actors you know and love from the game. Only Chie and Teddie are new, and the Teddie actor does a fantastic job. Even Chie, although being a very obviously different voice, manages to nail her enthusiasm and spunk.The animation is crisp and the dubbing is excellent, it requires a great deal of attention to notice that the lips don't perfectly match the words, which is truly amazing since the lips are speaking an entirely seperate language!A minor setback is the lack of Japanese audio... but as I am not Japanese (and since this is the American Amazon site, I presume you aren't either!) then that is such a minor triviality that you'd have to be insane to downrate the product for not supporting it!"
5,"If you liked Persona 4, you'll love this","Because of all the little references and cameos towards the game, 5 stars if you've played Persona 4, 3 stars if you haven't."
4,A Great Re-telling of a Great Story,"If you've played Persona 4 then you know the overall story told within this show. The animation adds some new and humorous jokes as well as some slight alteration to the events that occur. While it does follow the overall story of the games, enough is altered to make it entertaining to those who already know what happened in the game. I definitely recommend it to fans of the game as well as fans of anime."
5,bests dvd and game,i play the game on the PS Vita and i cant stop playing it when i heard that they making a tv show i got it and i love it i like the opening theme and ending theme song amazing
2,Subpar,"This is actually an old album produced before Foundation. Everything that was right with Foundation (their best album IMO) is wrong with Time's Running Out. Tired lyrics, tired delivery, tired CD. This should not be the CD that Brand Nubian goes out on..."
2,Dysfunctional album...,"There is no secret the members of Brand Nubian stopped getting along way back and this album reflects that. You do not get the ""one for all"" sense anywhere on this recording. Sounds like they would much rather be somewhere else."
1,Save your money and skip this one.,"The first thing I thought of when I read this book was #6 of the Goosebumps 2000 series. I Am Your Evil Twin much? The idea was pretty lame, and the book was fairly predictable. And the obvious ending will make you groan. As will the rest of the book. So save your money and skip this one."
3,liar review,this book is just like my name is evil. the ending is better but other than that few chills and scares.
2,Not as Expected,"My 7 year old son has just started out Gymnastics. As he was very excited, we wanted to watch a motivating and relevant movie on the subject matter. The feature had a “home movie” quality. Shaky camera, weird transitions, poor translation. It intended to show the achievement of underprivileged kids’ overcoming the obstacles through gymnastics, however it was more of homage to director’s brother who was the coach of the kids.I can’t say I wouldn’t recommended this movie as it is only of its kind of this matter except “McKenna Shoots for the Stars” so if you are looking for a gymnastics themed movie, this is one of them, but it barely got a mere “meehhh” from my son."
4,Great help when deciding to stay at the hotel,"I was undecided about where to stay in Chicago. Samantha Brown's review of the Hotel Monaco was very helpful, although some of the perks that she mentions are no longer available to my knowledge. If they are still available, they are not offered. I like being able to see a hotel room before staying there and this video was helpful in that regard."
3,Good but not good enough for me,As others said this book does not give you everthing. Especially on the side quests.I wanted a complete guide and this was not it.But it still helped me out alot.
4,A good book,"If you want to go 4 more than just beating the game, and want to find all the materia and beat the american monsters, get this book!"
4,"Excellent book, its worth getting.","This guide shows you all the tricks in there and everything. However you can actually surf the web and find 95% of the stuff in the book but this book is very well orginized (alll the details, walkthrough etc) that after reading it you don't need (or want) to read any other guides anymore. If you're a FF fan like me and wanted to explore the game rather than just finish it - this book is right for you."
3,"Brady gives a fair amount of info, but in a cumbersome way.","Unlike other hint and guide books, Brady compartmentalizes his information into characters, materia and stages, with maps at the end of the book. While all the information is there, its frustrating to have to flip through the book to find the map, then flip back to the specific scene/chapter you're in, all the while fending off various creatures. A former FF guide book for console was much better organized with maps and character info relevant to a specific chapter all together. Regardless, the book is better than nothing and, at the bundled price with the game, it is unthinkable to try FF VII without it. Until something better comes along, (the ""Unofficial Guide"" perhaps?), this'll do."
1,Insufficent info for HARCORE FF7 GAMERS,"Not bad for people who want to pass the game,find it good.For HARDCORE gamers like us,the info is too insufficent.Inside info,such as reviving Aeris(This is myth so far) are not found.Percentage of Cat Sith'limit break success are not shown.Times of limit break to upgrade are not shown.Too lousy,I demand a new version!!!"
1,This is a book that's not detailed enough and too many error,"Much of the data in tables are wrong: looks like they didn't do ANY check. Ways to get chocobos are not accurate, the greens' table is wrong, too many enemies not listed in the end of the book, and among the ones listed much of the info is wrong, and some enemy's HP are even ??? (I can easily find the number out by using Gamehack) and they're calling this ""OFFICIAL GUIDE""? Com'on, give me a break. None of the info in the book cannot be obtained by playing yourself a few times, it's like writtin just by someone who played the game, without ANY info from Squaresoft's game creators. When I compare this book to some good FF7 sites in the Internet, I found that I can really get more info on the game. The only good thing about this book is that IT'S A BOOK and it's easier to read then printed paper and has graphics, however, everything is black and white except the few maps section at the end of the book."
3,hmm... is it worth the money,"well, as a webmaster of a final fantsay site myself... ive read an AWFUL lot of ff7 walkthroughs. this one is ok, but the price unjustified as you can get a far more, although i hate to say it, accurate walkthrough from almost any final fantasy site on the net. i think the book point the player in the correct directions but should really be more accurate on its fact, as it IS the official guide"
2,"Not bad, not the best.","Although I have not yet seen a better walkthrough, they could have added a lot more. Let me make this breif...if you need help with something, don't go out and buy the book because that is pretty much all it will help you with- that one thing. Ask your friend for help, or go to Funcoland.com- they have a good but not thourough walkthrough there.Hope I could help."
3,This book is a good guide for beginners.,"I ranked it a 3 star because it is really messed up. For example, you have to fight a dimond weapon the guide tells you that it has 100,000 HP but the section where it tells you about all the foes it says that it has 0 HP and 500,000 levels."
2,Keep Trying,"This was not as well put together as the UNOFFICIAL guide. If you really are looking for a better one than this strategy guide, check the stores/etc. for the un-official guide. Because I have both and th un. gives more info needed in the game and it is easier to understand."
5,FFVII,"This was by far the best book for the game ever sold! With all the materia locations, what more could you ask for. The lack of maps actually made the game more intresting. The book gives you what you want. as detailed as you are willing to read into. It gives you fair warning before it gives the best parts of the game away, unlike he others I've read. Honestly, it's the best game book I ever bought...."
3,commendable,I love the game and the guid but i need the code to the safe on the fist disk!H-E-L-P! Scribblesnetmail@netscape.net
4,"Without This Book, I'd Be Lost","As someone who doesn't engage in rpg gaming often, this book really offered an excellent step-by-step guide to the wonderful world of final fantasy. It includes key images of scences in the game to keep you on the right track, and to illiminate unneeded confusion. I can honestly say that without this book, I would have never gotten through the game with my sanity in tact. The only thing that I found lacking was explinations of some of the vital aspects of the game. For instance, the book never really goes into what materia really is. Because of this, I found myself floundering in this concept of ""slots"", and what combination of which materia is the best."
4,The best strategy guide I ever bought,"This book has everything. The only complaint is that the pictures are black and white, but the full color maps are awesome. If your just starting the game, this book has everything you'll ever need. If you buy any guides for FFVII, buy this one."
4,Satisfying,"In desperate situations, troubled times, even cramped spaces, you can rely on Final Fantasy 7 to relieve youreself of your stress. But when you get stressed from Final Fantasy 7, there's only 1 thing to do. GET FINAL FANTASY 7: OFFICIAL STRATEGY GUIDE!!!"
5,"Great Book, Nice Details and graphics, totally cool.",This book is really cool.I like RPG games and I must say that this is the greatest one I've played since FF3. Final Fantasy VII is great for both playstation and PC. I played it on Playstaion and thought it was great and when it came out onto PC. I was really excited. This book is great for helping you on the PC version.
2,BUY THIS 1 ONLY TO BEAT THE GAME,"This book spoils the whole plot. it tells u everything that's going to happen, and it dosn't even have good tips on how to beat emerald weapon, ruby weapon, and ultimate weapon. It also doesn't have any good tips on how to raise chocobo's. It dosn't even tell u about the verry last boss. it tells u about the 2 diferent forms of sephioth.but it dosn't tell u how cloud goes off and faces sephiroth on his own with no materia.The only reason i would recomend this to u is if ur trying to beat the game for the first time. And even then it still is kinda bad."
3,Not bad,"The guide is lacking in some areas, but is still okay. But if you are looking for a challenge, try doing what I did; beat it first, then buy the guide, see what I missed, then start over."
4,"good, but indiscriptive in some areas","this book can help you alot however, there are some places in the game that the book does not discribe but all in all this book helped me beat the game in 19 hours"
3,Why Washington is the way it is....,"Written as she neared her death, Meg Greenfield puts forth the argument that Washington, D.C. is much like high school.....that social code that is based on being seen with the right people, in the right places. It makes me shudder thinking of Newt Gingrich or Tom Daschill as the BMOC and greatful that while they may have had some say on public policy, my self worth is not based on either of them noticing me on the way to civics! Written with an insiders's eye and an acid wit, Washington is the ultimate insider's view of the weird world of the Beltway. While it is entertaining to read, and it is fun to try to guess who is who, I find myself wishing I knew more about the author. What a shame that there is not a book about Meg Greenfield."
3,Hello World,"Greenfield's book is particularly valuable for anyone who keeps an eye on the political world. She points out, accurately, sharply, but in what I can only call a courteous manner, that politics is filled with hypocrites, charlatons, and ignoramouses.Pretty much like the rest of the world."
1,a sad and boring read,"I guess that I was disappointed. I had heard that this book was the posthumous memoir of a Washington insider and I was kind of expecting remorse, or the possibility of redemption, or something. Whatever I was looking for, I did not find it. The author seems to fancy herself clever and an expert on human relations but all I got was shallow observations and affected prose. She goes on and on, for example, about ""V-shaped smiles"" -- a certain insincere facial expression unique to the Beltway-- but not without name dropping the literary genius who coined the term. At times I found myself wondering, ""Did this anecdote really happen, or is it just a device to tie into the next section of the narrative?"" I get it :""Life (in Washington) is like high school."" I'll do that insight one better: 'Washington' is a John Hughes movie about high school -minus the entertainment."
1,It's terrible,"I cannot agree more with the reviewer who panned this book. Meg Greenfield may have been a great journalist, but a great journalist does not a great author make.She never gets to the POINT. While there are some mildly interesting stories about people in government, a far better book is (her former boss) Katharine Graham's Washington. Spend your money on it."
4,Insightful look at Washington's insiders,"It is a shame that I wasn't aware of Meg before she passed away. She sounded like a journalist with great integrity, something we have a severe shortage of. Her insights into the psyche's of Washington power players is useful in bringing the good old boys club down to earth. However, I had to disagree with her contention that the relationships between elected officials and the press should be personal, if not intimate. Had she still been around to see Bush junior lead his buddies in the press down the golden path towards war I think she might have changed her mind. Alas, now we'll never know. Still, her worthy words remain with us forever."
3,"A gossipy, insightful book on Washington, DC","Ms. Greenfield does a great job of piercing through the veil of Washington politics and double-speak. Slightly more bitter than other books on the subject, Ms. Greenfield none the less is able to penetrate the Washington Mindset and put into clear and understandable terms. Though she never mentions anyone currently in office in a bad light, one can have fun guessing who she means, while enjoying the dramatic backdrop and background she presents. This is an interesting companion to other, more 'sunny' versions of political writing which seems to dominate the market today"
3,Final product not a tribute to the author,"It's ironic that these posthumous memoirs by an influential editor are badly in need of - an editor. Granted, the book was assembled from notes, but need that be so obvious? It would benefit by being about 1/3 shorter since every third paragraph is padding. Perhaps when the author has died, it seems that no word is too superfluous to be omitted. I feel confident that if the author had lived to write this book in its final form, it would have been both entertaining and enlightening. As it is, I'm afraid, it's neither."
4,Radoukanov,"Any recording that features Entcho Radoukanov will be a worthy addition to a bassist's CD collection, however while the Entcho trademarks are here (smooth, lyrical phrasing, exciting tempos and incredible left hand accuracy), they are sometimes difficult to hear over the orchestra. In general, the solo bass should have been recorded better-it is not as loud or present as it needs to be. The playing, however, is superb."
1,"Zipper unzips from the bottom, only buy if you want to replace the zipper.","I have only worn this robe 3 times and the zipper started coming undone from the bottom and unzipping upwards to where the zipper pull is. I thought maybe it was a one time thing so I tried again - same thing. I have a medium, and it's a bit big on me so it's not like I'm busting out of it - the zipper (as another person mentioned) is very cheap and in my opinion, not really functional. I would only recommend this robe if you never plan on using the zipper. Other than the zipper, the robe is fine."
4,"Good perotection, but...","I have a Samsung MX20 and it fits snugly in this case with plenty of room for cables, extra batteries, SD cards, lenses and the rest of my my junk. I like the foldout style opening and the internal organizing pockets. The zippers are nice and robust and it is well padded. The construction has been durable as well. agree that the strap is a bit short and that it could use a couple of outside pockets. I also wish it had rubber feet on the bottom. But it has served well and been a good value."
4,"Great Case, has some weak points","The Good, it fits my Sony camcorder like a glove and provides great protection. The fold out slot for the case is well padded and and makes taking the camera in and out the case a breeze.The Bad, the strap that comes with the case is to short, and the clips don't swivel and can come off the case if they get twisted. I could use a few outside pockets for batteries and other often need accessories."
2,A real let down,"I suspect Scoppotone wrote this just to resolve the Lauren/Kip/Alex triangle which came to ahead at the end of her last book.I hated the new format of each suspect revealing their fears after they'd been interviewed by Lauren and the ending seemed so abrupt - unless I missed something I was a bit bemused. The pieces of the puzzle just did not seem to fit together, it was a very shoddy denouement (if you could call it that)& not terribly plausible either.I've always enjoyed the ""Lauren Laurano mysteries"", however upon reading this latest one it was apparent that the author has no plans to develop the series any further as she too has clearly become bored with Lauren & Kip.Time to move on I would say & after having finished the book and read the interview at the back with Scopptone I gather that this is exactly what she plans to do."
2,A very disappointing entry in a good series,"Having read all the titles in the Lauren Laurano series, I was surprised at how feeble ""Journey"" was. Lots of driving around, very little action (mental or physical), shallow character portrayal, and hasty writing. The ending was pathetic, like a hurry-up job to get the manuscript to the publishers on time.What happened?"
1,Poor plotline with many holes in it.,"This book was very disappointing. The plot was non-existent and the dialogue one-dimensional. I thought pages had fallen out of my book at the end because I couldn't believe the way the murderer was revealed, with absolutely no analysis of or connection to the clues. It seemed that the author decided that she had written enough pages to satisfy her editor, so she just said ""It's obvious to everyone that the murderer is [X]."", and then ended the book with another silly scene between Kip and Lauren. I usually look forward to the next book in a series, but I was not sorry to read that she has no plans to add to this series. Maybe she'll spend her free time going to some writing classes."
4,Not your average French Aristocrat,"Having seen the movie Quills some time ago I was interested to learn more about the historical Sade. Schaeffer provides a very thorough account of Sade's 74 years. The numerous excerpts from his letters give the reader an opportunity to get to know the real Sade. Much of the myth of this interesting writer is dispelled, but one can clearly see how they came into existence. My final impression of Sade is of a man of extremes, especially in his literature, who desperately sought to find his place in a society that he found too conservative for his liberal sexual views. Overall the book was an enjoyable and interesting read. I came away not only with more knowledge of Sade, but also of the French Revolution and prison practices during that era. I recommend this book to history buffs and those who enjoy biographies. The Marquis de Sade was definitely not you average ordinary French aristocrat."
2,Not so interesting book about an interesting man.,"Schaeffer has clearly done his homework on the Marquis de Sade however I didn't want to know every single piece of information he found. Far too much of the book is spent covering the same areas, like Sade's ongoing financial issues, while the end of Sade's life is covered comparitively briefly. There is also an assumption that all readers are fluent in French. I'm not so a lot of titles and French expressions were lost on me. There may not be exact translations into English but giving at least a general idea of the meaning would be helpful."
2,DVD cabinet?,"Nice piece of furniture, be wary of the ""Multimedia"" label. There are 7 shelves, however, only 5 will take DVD's ""upright."" The other 2 shelves require the DVD's be placed sideways. Looks a little weird if it's in your parlor, TV room etc."
2,get what you pay for,Cover was black in the picture but came grey. One light gray and one dark gray. Sizing by the manufacturer is poor and strap locations are poor.
4,Canvas Snowmobile Cover,"This cover fits my machine perfectly. I have an older sled that is the normal regular size; not one of the big long racing type. It has lasted well outdoors thru summer and winter, not showing any signs of wear yet. For the price I paid I would definitely recommend it for the average rider tho it would probably not suit the ""fancy"" type who want everything to match perfectly. Just a plain canvas cover that sheds rain well. Hope this helps."
5,Webern with guts,"These orchestral pieces are played in chronological order, so if you listen straight through you can hear the startling progression from the overripe Wagnerism of ""Im Sommerwind"" to the incredible compression of the late works, when Webern rations each note like a starving man trying to make a slice of bread last a whole week. Give this disc an hour of your time, and you can experience his entire creative arc.The performances are not clinical and cold, as can easily be the case with this music. Rather, they are powerful, intense, and even upsetting. The scorching Passacaglia sounds like a late Mahler symphony compressed into 10 minutes of music. The other pieces remind you that Webern was living in the same city as Freud and Hitler. This is indispensable modern music; but its romantic roots are also made perfectly clear here."
5,Surprisingly Very Good and Fun to Read!,"I wasn't sure that I would like this story, but I gave it a try, and I loved it! I really enjoyed the humor and liked the message it had to offer with out being preachy. It was a great spoof of the way fairy tale type stories are to be. Anyway, it was fun to read and I found it quite amusing."
5,"Hilarious, wise, and wonderful book.","I just finished reading this to my 7-year-old, and was horribly frustrated each night that he would doze off or simply state that he had to sleep, and I had to stop reading. (I did cheat and read one chapter ahead once, and giggled and teased him that I knew what was going to happen.)What can you say about a book in which a wise man has to masquerade as a fool to make a living, skilfully hiding the fact that he is anything other than a complete idiot... a third princess (who is supposed to be more beautiful than her gorgeous elder sisters, who are then expected to become witches and fly off on broomsticks, and were thus named Asphalt and Concrete to inure them to their fate) is actually born stunningly ugly...This book is a solidly entertaining read, contains much gentle but pointed absurdity, and I am buying a copy of her other book as soon as I finish this review. You _must_ read this, if for no reason other than to learn what a ""chest protector"" is. Enjoy!"
1,Trash,"If I could give it -5 stars I would.I can't believe people spend money to trash Christianity and America like this. Take notice. Whose in the jails trying to make life better for the prisioners, whose in your neighborhoods helping out, who's trying to make a positive difference? It sure isn't people who have nothing better to do than to trash these very same people! It's Christians. I'm sick of the satire. Take your trash to the only place it deserves, the city dump."
4,speaks to your sprit,This book spoke to my sprit. It made understanding how the Holy Sprit speaks to me beleavable. There was no doubt in my mind how to speak and how I was spoken to by the Holy Sprit. Mr Hagin made the text clear and easy to understand. Anyone wanting to know how the Holy Sprit speaks to us will come away feeling he knows exactlly what Mr Hagin is talking about. It was the most up lifting work I have ever read.
5,Hard to grasp some of its truths at first.,"This is one of the few books where I would read something, and say ""uh?"". I found that I had to read several passages over and over again to get the meaning, which is important with any book. I have no problem with this book at all, in fact, it was almost too simple to read. Even in that, I still had a hard time understand some of the things he taught until I read it over and over again. He really cover some very important detail in this book, that though it really prepares the newbie in Christ for hearing from his spirit, the Holy Ghost, and God, its still very challenging to read. I had been saved for many many years and had been under a lot of Hagin's teaching, and I still found new material in this book that was hard to comprehend at first, but was a blessing after my understanding began to multiply on the subject. Like with any other book of his, do not plan to read through this book just once. I very highly recommend this book."
4,Not so bad!,"I did not not find the book as bad as the other two reveiwers. If it is a period piece and written true to form, at the time the men wear, rakes, rouges, and scoundrels. Which this main character is. I did not have problems following the sub-plots and found this book lightly entertaining."
3,Not so funny,"It seems like he's trying to keep the ""Cajun-boy"" persona up with making ""cute"" grunts and mumbles that are supposed to be the funny part. On Inner Voice, I expected to hear some funny stuff about the girl, etc., he was talking to but it was just some stupid, incoherent, mumbling."
5,This CD is hilarious,"I am proud to be the first person to review this CD. It is one of the funniest albums I have heard in years. Adam Sandler is extremely talented. The sketches he wrote are vulgar but painfully funny. And the songs are excellent...especially ""The Chanukah Song, Part II"". It's an instant classic. This is Adam Sandler's very best CD. If you want a fun time, buy this CD now!!!"
2,"Funny at some points, just plain boring all in all.","This is Adam Sandlers fourth CD of song, and skits, and I must say, its boring. Points make you chuckle, but most of it is just boring. Many of the skits are too long, with no point but to fill up time. If you want to hear Adam Sandler at his best, buy his first album Their All Gonna Laugh At You, and his second What The Hell Happend To Me"
2,The worst Sandler yet,"I picked this up the first day of release. There are a few funny tracks, but for the most part it is lousy. I am a big Sandler fan but I think he has been to busy to put together a decent album. Track 10 is VERY funny (The Champion), the Chanukah song remake is good, but track 7 (Whitey) is stupid. I kept waiting for it to get funny and it never did... the bad part is its over 16 minutes of boredom. I know he is capable of much better and I am sorry I wasted my money."
2,"ITS OK, compared to Sandlers other cd's","The new Adam Sandler cd,to me, isn't all that good. BUT I AM A HUGE FAN OF HIS WORK.The Chanukah song is pretty funny but that's about it. Adam over did the ""cool guy"" thing big time. The skits of those are basically the same thing each time. I must admit the last one is pretty funny though. But my tip to you, buy a different Adam Sandler cd."
5,"I'm crazy I guess, but I think it's his best!","I have all 4 Adam Sandler CD's...I admit it, the guy makes me laugh like crazy. I really, unfortunately, go against the grain on this one. It appears that this is everyone's least favorite, but it's my favorite! His funny kid's voice on the first track with ""Hot water burn bay-bay!"" is great as well as each of his ""cool guy"" skits ""gettin' it on with da laydies!"" (almost). Throw in the Peeper and Uncle Donnie (feckin' ...!) and you've got one funny CD. My second favorite is ""What the Hell Happened to Me?"". I don't, however, like ""They're all Gonna Laugh At You."" too much...it didn't have the underlying cleverness that his other skits have--it's just more annoying or something. But, all of em are worth having if you love to laugh! :)"
5,A modern classic,This was Adam Sandler at his best. But I would recommend the other four CDs also. No comedy collection would be complete without the rest of his works.
2,Limited laughs...,"Having collected all the Adam Sandler CDs over the years, this was my last to be purchased. Even though most of the reviews for ""Stan & Judy's Kid"" were mostly positive, they remained relatively mixed. Other than being familiar with Sandler's style and previous work, I wasn't sure what to expect here...Most of the skits on this CD left me waiting for something entertaining to occur - but ultimatley left me asking, ""Is that it..?""The ""Sean"" skits were mildly funny, ""The Champion"" track was good, but the only substantial comedy seemed to come from ""The Psychotic Legend of Uncle Donnie"".I'll admit, I'm not a big fan of most of the songs Sandler includes on his CDs (and ""Welcome My Son"" on this album was downright dumb). Ultimately, I felt this effort just didn't measure up to the better stuff released on his first couple of albums.Glad I bought this one used and cheap."
2,I Expected Some Humor,"I listen to a lot of stand-up comedy (such as George Carlin, Richard Pryor, and even Bill Hicks) so I don't mind foul language, but this album is simply trashy - even tasteless. Most of this album is silly. I like silliness...but not like this. ""Whitey"" is way too long...and for what? The jokes are bad! There's no payoff!What a disappointment."
3,"Adam Sandler is funny but, not on C.D.!","Adam Sandler is my favorite actor (Comedian) but, I think it is not the same hearing comedy instead of seeing it! Adam sandler is a good singer & can sing but I think he will get more laughs on the big screen! I did like a few of the tracks of the c.d. ones which he sang on & a couple of tracks were kind of funny! I thought Hot Water Burn Baby was kind of funny! It was hard to listen to the really long tracks with out being able to watch him! I LOVE YOU ADAM BUT, I AM SORRY, I think your C.D. WAS OK! This cd contains appearances by a few of adam's friends that are in his movies! Plus he wrote all of the tracks! Which is good!But I just have to say Adam On T.V. is best so I can see him act & see his cute face! :-)"
5,Adam Sandler is like a dirty Robin Williams.,"Adam Sandler is at his funniest with Stan and Judy's Kid. ""Hot Water Burn Baby"" is the funniest track around. If you don't mind the cursing, you should definetly get this."
2,Not Very Good,"I went out to buy this CD earlier today b/c I have all of Adam Sanler's CDs. This CD is a disappointment though. There isn't any part on the CD that is especially funny (except for the Cool Guy parts) and many of the sketches last way too long--16 minutes for one and 11 minutes for another! Anyway, the first Adam Sandler CD was much, much funnier and thats the one to get."
2,not great,"I smiled, but I don't think I laughed. It is the kind of thing you will listen to a few times and then let it collect dust. I don't see how these other people think you will be cracking up and all that josh... his other cd's were a lot better."
4,Really Funny!,"Sandler is back with his brand of bizzare (and sometimes downright disturbing) comedy. Having always been a bigger fan of his sketches than his songs (which are still quite good) I was pleased to see him drop the all-music format of his previous release, ""What's Your Name?"" Sandler fans will love this, though if you've never heard him anywhere but the movies or SNL, be prepared...this is *not* the Adam Sandler you know from television and the big screen. Sandler reserves his most outrageous ideas for the CD's. ""Hot Water Burn Baby"" is typically funny Sandler, and the five ""Cool Guy"" shorts get funnier with each one."
2,"It has it's moments, but not a great CD.","I'm sorry folks, this is just not classic Adam Sandler. This CD is not half as funny as ""What The Hell Happened to Me,"" or even ""They're All Gonna Laugh at You."" The series of ""Cool Guy"" skits are OK the first couple of times, but after 4 or 5 new ones, they seem like nothing more than idle space fillers. I did find ""The Peeper"" and ""The Champ"" slightly amusing however, and ""The Psychotic Legend of Uncle Donnie"" was OK. But unlike Sandler's other albums, I found myself hitting the track skip button on my CD player often. Don't bother paying for this CD unless you're a hardcore Sandler fan."
2,Not even compareable to his other cds,"""Stan and Judy's kid"" is one of the most uninspired cds i've heard in a long time. Adam Sandler's other 2 cds with skits on them, ""They're all gonna laugh at you"" and ""What the hell happened to me?"" were both laugh out loud hysterical. This cd, is just boring, and painfully unfunny.I don't see what he found funny in most of these skits. ""Hot Water Burn Baby"" is unbelievebly stupid. ""Whitey"" is the longest, and most painful time waster I've ever heard. All of the ""cool guy"" skits are lousy, and don't even get me started on the awful songs. The only saving grace here is ""the peeper"" which did make me laugh, but after the first listen, it got really old.Skip this cd and ""What's your Name"", buy his 2 others."
1,How did such a funny man make such a bad CD?,"""What's My Name"" was funny, and you could listen to it many times over because it was clever. I am a huge Adam Sandler fan, but this latest CD is garbage. There are some laughs, but too few, and they will not return during the second listening. This CD is a rip-off. Only the sound-effects dude put any effort into this recording."
2,I gave it 2 stars for.....,"I gave it 2 stars for ""Whitey"" and ""The Psycotic Legend Of Uncle Donnie"". These skits are hilarious! especially the Uncle Donnie one where the drunk donnie kills his 3 grandsons with a stolen motorboat. It may seem vulger but it is hilarious! Whitey is about a midgit with a high pitched voice and hates spencers. Buy this album for these two skits....better yet download and burn the album!"
3,It's mmmkay.,"It was good, not great. Although Adam Sandler is funny, some of it was stupid. But some of it was so hilarious I was cracking up on the floor. The Chanukkah Song Pt. II could've been better. It was a good song but ya know. It wasn't as good as the prequils and believe me after one hit album it's hard to write the next."
2,Sporadic flashes of brilliance but overall a loser,"This CD is not very good. There are a few places that make you laugh pretty hard, but overall, the CD is not worth the money. His last few CD's were much better."
1,Pitiful,"Painfully unfunny. Sandler reminds me of everyone's moronic, pothead cousin who thinks that a smirk and a a few trite observations make him a comedian. This guy is SOOOO limited by a lack of talent, creativity and intelligence. Did we really need a sequel to the ""Hannukah song""? He is the Yanni of comedy and this album should never have been released except privately to his family. It is just a matter of time before he goes the way of Jerry Lewis and becomes another has-been who didn't know when to stop or when he was no longer funny."
1,One of the worst films I have ever seen.,"I cannot stand this movie.I feel disgusted both my time and my money were so badly wasted.It was so bad I came very close to throwing it out the window.Whatever you do,please don't see it.Going into how bad it was would require using up a huge part of the screen."
1,Not exactly as advertised,"The dimensions given for this shelving unit are a bit deceptive. I was looking for a small shelf to store media and a few tops. This looked like just what I wanted. Unfortunately the depth measurement is out to the widest part of the base, which is more than twice as wide as the shelves themselves.This thing was also the worst designed item to put together, it is not stable, it does not look good. The main supports are actually made of two boards held together by tension anchors causing the entire system to be almost impossible to get to stand up perfectly straight.I would not advise anyone purchase this item."
3,Has cheesy acting mixed with accurate fighting sequences,"This movie is one of the only true ""ninja"" movies i have found. It has StephenK. Hayes in cameo work which authenticates the action. The movie isnt that great but gives an accurate portrayal of the bujinkan system and philosophy and has some of the most realistic fighting sequences ever filmed for ninjutsu. I recommend it to anyone who only knows the myths about this art."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Being a fan of Stephen Hayes, I was excited to see his name on this in what seemed to be a ninja vs the Ku Klux Klan. Minutes into the movie, my instinct told me it would be a loser when it opened up with an overweight topless woman changing. What does this have to do anything? I asked myself. Next followed a sorry excuse for a hero with no combative skill, athletic ability or common street sense whatsoever. What the heck was he doing in this supposed ninja training? A junior high kid track athlete would have put this ""hero"" to shame. Ninja Vengeance was a misleading title, since there was obviously no real ninja doing much of anything. It should have been called ""Blundering Youth Stumbles Across Rednecks"". The acting and dialogue was as cheesy as something a double digit IQ person would have inspired. You end up not really caring much about any of the characters in this film. Don't waste your time."
3,Good in an emergency,"If you have been dumped with the task of training people on presentation skills and have hardly a clue about how to do it yourself, then this is a manual for you.It's not a book. It is the contents of the presentation in one section and student handouts in the other. There's little difference between the two sections. While superficial and dull, it'll get you through the dreaded day and may save your skin.However, I feel that career trainers or experienced presenters looking to really help their audiences may find this publication disappointing.If you are a serious beginner or a happen to be in the 2nd category of reader, get Gene Zelazny's book ""Say it with Presentations"" and take a flying start instead of plodding along with McGraw-Hill."
5,I have seen the future of pop...,"Darren Pearson and Liz Overs have concocted a stunning debut of remarkable versatility. How many albums can you name that seamlessly evoke prime-time 70's FM rock *and* 80's electropop? At the same time, 100% Human is strikingly contemporary, mixing in trip-hop rhythms with the abovementioned retro influences. Genre borrowings aside, what sticks in the mind are the insanely catchy tunes, darkly humourous lyrics and alluring vocals. Taken as a whole, 100% Human practically screams breakthrough. Make no mistake; this is the stuff of which pop legends are made."
4,Ave Caesar!,"Matthias Gelzer covers the life of Caesar, who I must admit I believe to be the greatest of all historical figures, very well. His insights and his speculations are all well founded as one would expect of a great scholar such as Gelzer.I read this book as part of a degree course and, although I don't necessarily agree with everything he has to say, all of it is interesting and worthy of, at least, discussion.I would rate this book far higher than the book on Caesar by Christian Meier, but Meier's book has some interesting points that Gelzer does not. Overall though, for a book on the life of Caesar, Gelzer is the best to be found at the moment."
4,An excellent buy,"This is loaded with fun, simple games. This would make any flight painless. I can't wait to use it over the holiday travels. For everyones info... I got this today and paid $4.95 for it (on Amazon). Watch closely for price changes. This went from $9.95 to $4.95 to $19.99 all in one week."
3,Regret paying so Much,"I was so excited when I first ordered TouchMaster because I love these simple type games.Unfortunately of the bunch many are lazy spin-offs or duplicates of the other games. for instance no Yahtzee, but at least 2 yahtzee rip-offs that are nearly an identical game.For mahjong I can hardly see the little tiles and must use the letter version. one game I finished and the wrong tiles were left! One suddenly changed and I could finish.Most of the games are poor filler. I would say maybe 5 are worth he time or money. For $20 bucks I would consider this game, but regret paying $30"
5,Recommend to Everyone,I love this game and so does my daughter. There's such a variety of different games to play all on one little disc. Very entertaining!
3,"Fun to play, if you have amazing sight","This game has the classics from the Touchmaster games that you find in bars and resturants. I enjoyind playing the games, but it's very difficult to see on such a small screen."
3,Better than watching paint dry?,"I was disappointed. I just bought the DS with Brain Age 2 and wanted Tetris, but that's so expensive now that I tried Touch Master instead. The games were OK but nothing great. I think what is missing is manipulating the objects on the screen...none of the decision making of Tetris, just one touch playing. The skill level needed seemed like something for young kids, not adults."
1,Problems with the game...2009 maybe fixed...,"We had problems with this game, thought it was the game but after returning it 4 times and everytime the same thing happened. It wasnt our DS system because we have 4 different ones (different in days owned).When play the trivia game, which we played a lot. I would say after playing it 30 times, we would be in the middle of a game and it would lock up and the only the you could do is turn it off. This game was fun but this was our only issue. We called the company that made it in Chicago and they took all the information and told us this (trivia) was the only game that had to be re-written for the DS. SO FYI.... this game locks up on trivia. 2009 update : We bought a copy for 5$, for this past Christmas, and so far so good, no locks up on Trivia or anything else, so maybe just maybe the editor finally corrected the problem, FYI."
2,The words and such are too tiny to read in this game,"I bought this game mainly for it's Powercell (aka Freecell) game. Unfortunately, the cards are so tiny, I cannot read what value they are. It's very frustrating and disappointing."
5,Touchmaster review,"A great game with lots of versatility -- if you're not addicted to DS playing, you will be when you find the games you like on this one. Lots of fun."
4,TouchMaster,"There are so many games that are a part of TouchMaster. I enjoy choosing different types of games rather than playing the same game over and over again.I haven't used it, but I like the opportunity to connect to others and challenge another person."
4,Fun to Play,"Good variety of mini games. Touch screen makes it easy to play trivia, cards, and puzzlers. It is a good pass time while waiting for your flight at airports, etc. I find the games fun and enjoyable."
5,Great Game for DS,I like my DS for quick easy games while waiting for appointments or relaxing at the end of the day. Touchmaster is great because it offers a lot of game options and it's both easy and fast.
1,disappointed,"although other people gave this game almost 5 stars, I found this very boring. You just play each game over and over again. There's no levels to the games and i found no real chalenge. If you do buy this, make sure you keep the receipt so you can exchange it for something that works the mind more. I wouldn't give this game more than 1 star."
5,This Game is Awesome !!,There is a whole lot of fun packed into this little game! My family & friends are all addicted to it.
3,It's OK.,"This is a decent collection of mini-games. The graphics are dated, but I expected that since it was created 3-4 years ago. The directions for how to play many of the games are not clearly written and this is annoying if it's a game you have never played. Not hard to figure out, though, if you have the time to play around with it. I would rate this a star higher if there was a way to manually turn off the timer on some of the games. What is the point of being timed on a word search? You are one or two away from finishing and the puzzle disappears...times's up! Irritating. That said, I can easily find something enjoyable to play a half hour before bed. Glad I paid under $20."
3,Could be better,"This game could be alot more fun then it is. I get so aggravated with the penmanship, it doesn't always use the letter that you write down.The spot the difference game doesn't always circle the differences and you are being timed.This really annoys me because I am very competitive."
4,Game For My Wife,My wife thinks the many games included are very good and she plays them as often as she can. I purchased Touchmaster because my wife loves the classic games. She would recommend it to anyone who is fond of the really classic games of a few years ago.
2,"Okay, but lacks longevity","I expected more out of this. The games are all pretty cheesy and after several plays I was anxious to move onto the next one. They all pretty much had the same theme and look. I wouldn't recommend this game if you are wanting something that will stand the test of time. I love card games, but this one was really lame.Added 10/14/10:My 5 year old nephew really enjoys this game. However, he seems to find more enjoyment in beating my score on each game that he plays. Ha Ha! He is a little competitive. So, there are some out there who do find this game entertaining."
3,Quit playing out of frustration,"This game was easy enough to figure out, but the physics aren't quite right. This allows you to find multiple answers to each of the levels but also makes for frustrating situations that should have worked. A few levels in, I quit playing because it was boring.So you know what games I usually enjoy:Diner DashProfessor Layton gamesViva Piniata"
5,"Don't Talk to Me, I am playing my game","I love this game. Have you ever played on one of theose Megatouch games at a bar? This has so many of those same games. I am positively addicted. I am a fan of tetris and solitare, that type of thing so this was perfect. They are all thinking games, but simple to learn and the book that came with it is actually helpful (sometimes I think this is a weak point of DS games). This is a game for kids to adults. This is the game that inspired my Mom and Aunt (both over 50) to buy a DS of their own."
5,Excellent practical guide for healing of relationships.,I have read this book and it is a very practical guide to healing of relationships of all kinds. The author focuses on fathers and their children with stories from his own experience. It would be a valuable addition to any library.
4,Lurlene McDaniels best book I read!,"Lurlene McDaniel is one of my favorite authors, and this book Mourning Song is by far the best book I read by her. Mourning Song glued your eyes to the book. McDaniel is an author that writes about teenagers with cancer, and how they over come their illnesses. In this book, Carrie, a senior, has been dignosed with a brain tumor. Since she's in the hospital she misses out on her graduation, senior trip, and whatever else she had planned. Her sister is helping her fufill her dreams by going to the beach. Will Carrie live to experience this dream of hers, or will her sister be able to take her?"
4,THINGS U NEED TO TREASURE,"This is the first book i've read from Lurlene McDaniel and i must say it's GREAT.After reading this book i realize how much the people around me means to me and that i must always treasure them as long as i live my life.This book is about love stronger than death and i strongly agree with it.As well as life is a gift.Everyone's life is a gift and how we live our life is the gift we give ourselves and people around.I like what the character,Austin who is Dani's best friend and the one who's always been there for her durng all the pain in losing her beloved sister. Anyway,because of this book i've read i begin to Mcdaniel's story though its quite sad but that's something u should learn to cope with it in life.Hope u'll check out this book and many others too.."
4,Lurlene McDaniel Is Amazing,"Lurlene McDaniel writes the most amazing, life-changing books. She tends to write books for the younger teen crowd but I love them even though I'm 32. They are deep, they stay with you and touch your heart in ways that you can't imagine. They change the way you view the world."
5,Return To Form for Blondie,"Eat to the Beat is my favorite Blondie recording because it was a return to their punk roots! After the huge sucess of Parallel Lines & it's slick production, this was so refreshing! The styles range from punk to pop to anthem, with the title track, Union City & Dreaming! The vocals are as only Deborah Harry can deliver them, beautifully!!"
3,"Some of the music works, some of it doesn't","New Wave legends dig into the vault for a unique release. The collectors edition of 1979's Eat the Beat is proclaimed the World's first video album. This concept is quite revolutionary, if it was still 1979. Today it seems kind of silly. However, when you think about it, this video album pre-dates MTV. The majority of the material included on the DVD ranges from concept videos to live performances. It's an interesting look at the music scene to say the least (it's also a great way to catch Debbie Harry in her prime).As for the music, if your only family with Blondie's radio hits, you're probably going to be a bit lost. The CD doesn't really contain any major hits, but does show the band taking some musical chances. Some of the music works, some of it doesn't. Either way, the DVD portion makes checking out this collection worth it."
2,No thanks!,"I am surprised to see so many reviewers lauding this album, because for me, it is a complete failure and doesn't come even close to the classics Parallel Lines or Plastic Letters. The problem lies in the songs: Atomic was obviously an attempt to recreate Heart Of Glass, but ultimately it goes nowhere and only has novelty value, at best. Union City Blue is an attempt at a soulful ballad, but also fails miserably. Dreaming is sort of acceptable, but lacks bite. I'm really sorry, but this album is a hopeless mess. It lacks cutting-edge songs with immediate hooks and personality. As such it is a quite forgettable album and didn't provide Blondie with any great hits. Rather stick to the above-mentioned classics or get one of their Best Of or Greatest Hits collections."
5,I was there,"Both music and videos of Eat to the Beat were THE blueprint for the new wave of the 80's. This is Debbie and the Band at their best, so good, that bands such as The Killers are still ripping them off today. Check out Debbie in Sound-A-Asleep, the epitome of beautiful and cool. Also, Clem Burke (drummer). This album was as much his as it was Debbie's. Outstanding throughout."
3,Sounds pretty dated ...,"I was expecting more out of this ... have spun through it 3-4 times and nothing really catches my attention. Her voice is in that ""in-between"" zone ... not that great, but nothing distinctive enough about it to make it appealing."
4,Their absolute peak,"Though Blondie was much more a singles band, this was the one time they pulled it all together to make a near perfect album. Right out of the gate, ""Dreaming"" is just blinding, and reminds you of how powerful you can feel when hearing a great song. From there, they just keep going, except for two stumbles: ""Eat To The Beat"" and ""Victor"" don't really work, but that's okay. Two more incredible moments on a stellar record: ""Slow Motion"", and then the majestic ""Atomic"". Near the end when Debbie sings, ""Oooohh, make it mag-ni-fi-cent...tonight...maybe tonight..."" it just gives me chills. To be sure, they had amazing songs after this (""Call Me"", ""Rapture""), but no album reached these dizzy heights. Now if they'd just re-release the ""Eat To The Beat"" video album on DVD..."
4,got the first track on a loop,"I haven't heard an Apache Indian tune in 6 years, took a chance on this. Well, the bet's paid off. I can't believe I've gone for so long without listening to this guy's music. It's energizing to say the least.The tracks on this CD aren't as consistent in tune as, say, No Reservations. Some tracks (Om Namah Shivaya for example) feel like they shouldn't have been there.However, that said, it's still a kick ass purchase. I've been playing the first track constantly for the past two days . . ."
5,"Inspired, other worldly","This poet is on to something. The imagery is vivid and powerful. His use of language is surprising and intelligent. This is a ""thinking person's"" book."
4,A writer in the face of today's spiritual pallor...,"This book shows wonderful creativity, anachronistically charming. The Plague Psalms shows a writer with his own agenda and a romance rarely seen in this day and age!"
5,Tastes like the real thing!,"I bought these for my husband. It's almost impossible to find sugarless black licorice in stores, & he's thrilled with these! Fast shipping, highly recommend."
1,different item than photo,"I ordered the sugar free black licorice bites shown in the photo but I received plain black licorice pieces. I was really hoping to get the colored pieces. I reordered them to try again and did not received the correct ones again. I am very disappointed in this purchase, however, the purchase was delivered very quickly."
5,Ten Stars ********** And Only 10 Years Old...!!,"Maria Isabel swept the music world in Europe with the release of her Music Video ""Antes Muerta Que Sensilla"" and winning the Eurojunior 2004 representing Spain. This CD includes all her songs and the DVD contains the Music Video and the entire journey to winning the Eurojunior 2004. It is excellent! If Maria Isabel chooses to continue her music career she will be the next Shakira. I give her ten stars **********"
3,Was hoping for a better quality puzzle for this price,"It's a pretty picture, and I love puzzles, however..The quality of the pieces is low, they chip easily, and most of all, many of them looks as if they connect fine but they don't. It's very frustrating, it needs to either fit or not.I actually thought about writing to the company about this. because even the pieces that connect like they're supposed to don't look right.I usually glue my puzzles when I'm done, and I can tell this one is not going to look that nice... the gaps between the pieces would look funny.A little disappointing for this price. I bought 1000 piece puzzles for 10$ that were higher quality."
5,A handy resource for ESL students or any non-native English speaker,"I like the small book, well-suited for a carry-on bag, which has much of what one needs to enhance daily communications in English. It helps listening comprehension, especially for sentences you cannot find in regular dictionaries. It serves an excellent niche for those whose mother-tongue is not English and want to add some colors to their communications, either in presentation or comprehension."
4,extraordinary 109,"I have not been knocked out by Grimaud's Bach and Rach, and I have not heard enough of her Brahms and other Beethoven to say; but this reading of op 109 is extraordinarily fine, to my mind. (Heard it on the radio.) Effortlessly powerful, clear, nonetheless inward but still unflagging throughout (which is not so common in this sonata). I don't think I have been so taken by a 'new' Beethoven pianist since Kovacevich, especially his first round in the late 1960s and early 1970s (as Stephen Bishop). And I'm not sure he ever did 109, though his 110 and 111 remain at the peak, in my view. Indeed, Grimaud resembles Kovacevich in any number of ways, including that clanging tone and color range. I must check out her 110 and the Brahms PC 1; can't take more Beethoven piano concertos, not at the moment anyway."
4,Good but not what I expected,"I bought the albun based on the Grammophone recomendation, and yes, atracted to the wolf history.The performances are very good, but they don't have the heart I was expecting.The third movement of the piano concert No 4 is the high point for me.Kurt Masur does a nice job, but nothing to write home about.Recording sound is excellent.Why 4 stars and not 3? Because the CD is flawless, it just lack heart.Recording sound is excellent"
4,Bought it for the Concerto; kept it for the sonatas,"I love the Beethoven 4th Piano Concerto, and I had heard that Grimaud was interesting, so I got this 3 years ago.The concerto is a serviceable performance, but neither thoughtfully deliberate nor powerful; I can't figure out what she had in mind when preparing it, for to my ears it seems to jump abruptly from aggression to dreaminess, with neither sort of characteristic executed with precision.The sonatas sound like a recording of a different pianist - when I play this CD, I start with track 4. Lovely stuff: focused, gradual progressions from theme to theme, as if she's always thinking of the previous stretches and building on them. If you seek a good introduction to late Beethoven sonatas, this is the best choice I can think of, because it is moving but not cerebral, and I say this as someone who doesn't mind the cerebral, analytical sort late Beethoven which alienates some listeners."
2,Why play Hamburg Steinway in NY?,"After I saw all these favorable reviews, I purchased this CD. Yes, the orchestra sounds good and the pianist is OK. One thing however I disliked about this CD was the sound of the piano. Before I listened it, I believed that she played on a NY Steinway because the orchestra was NY Philharmonic and it was recorded in NY, but I noticed a harsh treble range which is obvious in the 3rd movement of the concerto. I was a bit dissapointed. It of course depends on each instrument, but generally I feel the NY has richer and clearer treble and the Hamburg has rather glassy tone with more noticeable attacking noise. This one also sounds shallower. For Beethoven, I think NY tone matches better. Why not play NY Steinway in NY?"
4,Concerto for Piano (and moans),"Grimaud's piano technique is breathtaking, literally, for she gasps and quivers and shudders before each run of fingered melodic passion; however, the performances are so gripping that one should overlook these breathy blemishes. ""Hush now,"" just listen to the passion and the pain. Listen to the triumph she brings. There is much magic made on this album, even among the groans and moans. (I believe Beethoven was a groaner and a moaner as well.) Don't let it discourage you."
3,Making a statement does not always produce the best work,"A RIGHT TO DIE is Stout at his most political, using Wolfe to make a commentary about race relations in America. Wolfe's involvement in a case relating to the civil rights movement, interracial relationships, and of course, a murder that will confound the police, is an interesting time capsule. The book exposes some harsh truths which appear a bit dated today, but don't lack for impact. The mystery itself is a fairly involving one, but the weight of the events surrounding this particular tale is a bit too heavy for Nero and Archie to carry. Stout was not afraid to make political statements in this series, but they didn't always make for the best episodes."
2,Good story but with revolting protagonist,"In some ways, this is a very well-written mystery. It holds the reader's interest and the ending is anything but predictable. But, there are some facets that are insultingly unrealistic. Most notably, the great Nero Wolfe can summon all of the potential suspects to his home for interrogation, and they all willingly come! My biggest problem, though, is with Wolfe himself. He is pompous, obtuse, ungreatful, arrogant. I can only marginally enjoy a mystery if I dislike the investigator; that is the case with this book. In fact, knowing now how the Wolfe character is developed, it is highly probable that I will not read any more of the series. But, if you can get past the traits of Wolfe that I describe, I feel confident that you would enjoy this book, and probably all entries in the series. END"
5,another good one by Stout,"I am hoping to get a complete collection of Rex Stout mysteries on my kindle. This one I downloaded on my Kindle as my ship was transiting the coast of China. What more can I say? The Kindle system is great. Rex Stout is great, and I love reading about his tubby misogamist."
3,I guess he had to get on the civil rights bandwagon...,"This book was boring, reading it i got the impression it was an altered storyline to fit hte current civil rights movement of hte time. Wolfe was more annoying than usual and Archie more arrgravatingly natty. Even Fritz's usually neutral character got me down when reading this. If you are new to Nero Wolfe i would recommend starting with a lighter story, like maybe Some Buried Caesar."
5,Fabulous Book,Having read many golf books I feel qualified to comment. Steve's book breaks the full swing and short game down into manageable and understandable pieces. The pictures in the book make the instruction more understandable. My scores have definitely improved by implementing the instruction techniques contained in On the Other Hand.
5,Great authors and stories. A must read.,"This book is a definate must read. Yours truly, Jack the Ripper and The Most Dangerous Game have to be my favorite stories in this book, but I still like them all. If you can find a copy of it definatly buy or borrow immedietly."
2,Breaks Easily,"The negative of this product is that the plastic is so hard that it's fragile, making it chip and break easily.On the positive side, if you're extremely careful with the Batali ladle, it holds quite a large amount of liquid, which can be helpful for decanting and serving."
3,The White Cheddar flavor is the best,"I've ordered both a variety pack and a box of just the White Cheddar flavor and I believe White Cheddar is not only the best but the only edible flavor out of the whole line of ""rounds"" and ""mini-rounds"" produced by Just the Cheese. The other flavors just seem too salty.I was first exposed to them on a flight where they (The White Cheddar version) were given out as a snack.I was looking for a replacement for my beloved Cheeze-Its ever since I had to give them up going on Low Carb and just dieting in general. This isn't a complete replacement, but it will do for a low carb crunch snack."
1,Cheese Rounds are pretty bad,"I'm a Wisconsin gal and really love my cheese, so I was delighted to find these snacks. But I was terribly disappointed when they arrived. Despite being labeled ""lower in salt"" they were terribly salty. More importantly, the taste just wasn't very nice. Even my teenaged son wasn't willing to eat them. I'm afraid that we threw away all but the first 2 bags we opened. What a disappointment."
4,Nice substitute for Chips,A few of these instead of chips with your low-carb meal. Good choice to save dozens of carbs. I also enjoy them alone as a snack.
3,"Toooo Salty, but YUMMY!","Delicious, addicting, but way TOOOO salty! Great in a salad as a crouton, but if you try to make it through more than one serving, the salt gets to you. Also,I am told that autolyzed yeast contains a form of MSG, to which many are SENSITIVE or ALLERGIC, and which is terrible for EVERYONE! Would be delicious, and less salty, IMO, without it!"
2,Tastes terrible...............!!!!!!!!!!!???????????,"It tastes terrible. I guess you could pass it off as incredibly sharp cheddar, but I recommend you buy a bag and try them before you buy 12 bags. Like I did."
5,KRONOS ATTACKS!!!,"KRONOS is presented here in a really outstanding (Wade Williams IMAGE version) dvd, with crisp, sharp detail. This is a 1950s must have, as the huge energy sucking monster from outer space simply cannot be stopped!...or can it? This is indeed one of the better examples of the era. Better than THE GIANT CLAW (what isn't?), though not as good as FORBIDDEN PLANET (what is?). On par with EARTH VS FLYING SAUCERS, and that means pretty good! And if you check out the SCREEN ARCHIVES web site you can now purchase the Paul Sawtell soundtrack to this classic."
4,Kronos,"Great quality DVD that arrived on time. Kronos is a great old Sci Fi flick from the 'golden era' of science fiction with a plot that seems a bit more British than American. If you watch this genre, you have seen Jeff Morrow (This Island Earth) and Morris Ankrum (Earth vs. The Flying Saucers)in several of these movies."
3,different and fun,i absolutely fell for this movie. i have watched many typical movies from the 50's about aliens. kronos is not typical. a box shaped alien with pounding like feet that sucks up energy is fun to watch. you almost side with the alien due to its incredible power. very different and original. one drawback. a slow start but stay with it until it warms up.
4,The First Monster of the INDUSTRIAL age!!!,"What a great monster! I always loved watching ""Kronos"" as a kid....who couldn't love this massive metal giant rectangle stampeding across the country using it's piston shooting legs?!?!? And now the new DVD release finally gives us the film in it's original widescreen (scope!) ratio....WOW!!! I remember the full-frame version chopped off newspaper headlines and other action terribly. This new transfer looks great. Ya, the movie suffers a little bit from talky moments, but it's still campy fun and whenever Kronos is on screen...it's Fantastic! Industrial Mayhem!!!! Kronos will suck you dry!"
4,Much better than it gets credit for.,"I liked this movie a lot. Usually, movies like this suffer from the lengthy exposition and gradual build up to action, (i.e. the monster stomping around) but this movie is so well crafted that that part was just as much fun as the monster. Sure, the scientific explanations are flawed at best, but,considering how well The Da Vinci Code sells, I don't understand why suspension of disbelief would be so difficult."
1,"""Shockingly"" bad sci-fi. Save for last if just completing your collection.","Wow! I've been disappointed before, but I'm actually thinking of returning this one, as I don't think I'll ever watch it again. Many reviewers have given this film credit for having an unusual antagonist, granted, but it also has horrible junk science, wooden acting, terrible dialogue, plentiful stock footage, and it just plain stinks. Slow, painfully slow, to develop. Endless shots of helicopters circling. I couldn't wait for this to be over. If you want a movie that doesn't have a guy in a rubber suit as the baddie, track down the much superior ""Monolith Monsters"", which succeeds everywhere that this film fails."
1,Kronos,"This DVD would not play in any of the DVD's at home...This is one of my all time favorites....I am sorry to say I can not watch this movie on DVD. If I could give this movie a negative rating, I would. (only because this DVD would not play)"
2,Would you believe a robot that eats the world?,"Kronos is a skyscraper sized robot, that comes to earth to steal out power and transmit it back to it's planet. This is a different story line (at least back in the early days of Si-Fi flicks. For a change it had not only a fairly good plot, but even had a sub-plot in volving an alien remote controled human, controlling Kronos.For all the oldie movie buffs, this one's a must have."
3,Kronos DVD,The special effects in this movie are hilarious. The Kronos is a box on stilts.It gains in strength and power by absorbing power sources it comes into contact with like electricity. As humans attempt to stop it they use more powerful weapons like a hydrogen bomb which of course only makes the kronos more powerful.The movie has some good concepts that make it worth watching.
3,Kronos (1957)-Rediculous but fun sci-fi film from the 50's!,"I saw Kronos at the LUXOR Theater in the old Bronx back in 1957 when I was ten. At the time I really enjoyed it to the tune of four stars. Evaluating it today I would say I should rate it at only about three stars.It was entertaining and pretty well done. I believe this film qualifies as classic 50's sci-fi with all that entails. By the way, there is no question that Kronos demonstrated no means of foreward propulsion, and would definitely have punched holes into the earth beneath its column like legs (as another reviewer has already said)."
3,The Mexican airforce??!!,"Drink plenty of caffeine for this one, folks - it's not exactly a roller coaster ride. But that doesn't matter. I hate ""roller coaster ride"" movies, anyway. Still, there are several patches in this film where you glance at the time and wonder when it will end. On the concept level, however, this is a very interesting movie, particularly for the time and genre. If we could only go back and redo the special effects, make them less 2-dimensional, and re-edit it here and there, we might really have something."
4,kronos,i am a child of the 50s drivein movie generation. this movie was as i remembered it. good and hokie. good picture quality. i would recomend it..
2,Kronos,"It was as I expected. Old, hokey 1950's sci-fi movie. I saw it as a kid and wanted to see it again for old times sake. While not perfect, the production quality is better than Mill Creek's movie packs. If you don't expect too much you won't be disappointed."
2,"Darn, I'm not 6 years old any more","I absolutely adored this movie when I first saw it at the tender age of six. Blah-blah-blah-MONSTER!-blah-blah-blah-ROBOT! Well, I just saw it again at the age of 49 and it hasn't changed a bit. But I have.There are things here to love. The basic story is fascinating. The ecology movement is strongly foreshadowed. And much of the art design is gorgeous. Even some of the effects are beautiful. But the direction is terrible. The indoor sets are grotesque and stupid. The acting laughable. Most of the effects, especially cel animation, are abominable. Worst of all is the injection of Hollywood yuck-em-up laugh lines throughout the script. Not all of them intentional -- how shall I ever forget our romantic lead playfully imploring his wife-to-be, ""Can you respect the guy who pulled the biggest scientific boner of all time""?RIP, Kronos and my childhood."
5,great flick,"I remember seeing this movie as a kid in a kiddie matinee, crowded with kids at the long gone Fruitvale Theatre in Oakland. Great Flick!!! At that time, it was state of the art, and a thrilling plot. Bought this DVD and after not seeing it in over 30 years, it actually is a well made film!!!! The thought of a black box that grows peg legs, walking around depleting the earth of its electrical supply and destroying everything in sight is pure camp and fun!!! It is good to see this movie out again!"
5,Sci Fi,"Not a great movie, but just what I was looking for. Saw this movie when I was a kid and loved it."
4,"""What does all this add up to?!?!?!""","I love the first image of Kronos on the beach, like a piece of sculpture with get up and go. It's never quite terrifying enough though, to suit all the subsequent panic. The film stars Jeff Morrow (more of a sourpuss than hero), Barbara Lawrence (as a combination girl Friday, gofer, convenient girlfriend), and best buddy and computer hack George O'Hanlon. It's up to these three to save the world. Initially, I thought we were doomed.I bought this primarily to add to my collection of nitwit sci-fi flicks of the 50s. It works best as the first of a double feature (with the second film being a whole lot better. Think of it as a warm-up to get you in the mood)."
4,good quality video,"The video was of good quality, considering when this B&W movie was made. It took me back to when I was a little kid watching this movie for the first time. Yeah, it's a ""B"" movie by today's standards, but realize that there were no CGI and other special effects during the era."
3,"Cool Alien Villain, But A Bad Movie","I've always been a huge fan of 50's Sci-Fi B Movies, but to my own surprise, I'd never seen this one until recently. I wish I had a better review, but the movie was disappointing. It's a shame too, because the ""villain/alien machine"" (Kronos) is actually pretty cool for a 50's movie. I can't think of another B movie with a villain/alien quite like this one. Unfortunately, in all other areas, this movie was stupid; downright silly at times. Yeah, I know that B movies aren't supposed to be Oscar material in any sense, but even with that, this flick was a letdown. While it certainly isn't the worst B movie I've ever seen, it's definitely not the best either."
3,Old-time sci fi Kronos on DVD,"I bought this movie DVD because (a) it was cheap, and (b) I am a nut for science fiction, even if it isn't Roddenberry. The seller and the DVD producer did a fine job. But Jeff Morrow is on the Olympic team for bad acting, and the writers should have been sacked before they did such damage. I rate the DVD-maker and the seller A+A+A+, but the movie itself one star."
3,Crazy Crazy Crazy,"If you want a movie with a lot of cool special effects, this is NOT the movie for you. However, if you appreciate classic Sci Fi, and a decent story line, I recommend. I am biased because I like all of them, no matter how cheezy or bad. This movie does have several laughable scenes, when the ""robot"" starts ""walking"" around... You will chuckle too, I think. My overall rating...Fairly Bad but worth a look."
3,Kronos,Scenery was fake looking but one has to consider the technology back in the 50's. It did remind me of my younger days watching science fiction and I enjoyed that.
3,Kronos: No trespassing alien creeps!,"Kronos contains all the elements needed for a 1950s Sci-Fi movie. Brainy leading man, beautiful female assistant, comedic side-kick, and scientist secretly working for the aliens. While not one of the best SF films of the 50s, it's no where near the worst either. Right about in the middle is a good place for it. Aliens send a collector, the Kronos machine, to Earth to steal energy for their resourse depleted planet. I especially liked the scene where the bomber with the A-bomb is pulled into a collision with the Kronos. Through the use of the Synchro Unifying Sinometric Integrating Equitensor the hero, gravelly-voiced and craggy faced Jeff Morrow is able to figure out how to destroy Kronos. Barbara Lawrence is beautiful and smart. George O'Hanlon is the comedic computer operator and John Emory is the chief scientist secretly controlled by the aliens. Throw in the great Morris Ankrum and you've got a throughly enjoyable 78 minutes."
3,Good to see it again,"I remember seeing Kronos as a child when it aired on television. It seemed scary back then. It is not so scary today, and the effects are crude, but it is still a pretty good movie. The premise is that a giant robot from another world has come to earth to suck up our energy. The planet it came from was experiencing an energy crises, how prophetic is that? This giant Tin Man with attitude is attacking our power plants and other sources of energy. Astronomers investigate and track this thing, with one of them being possessed by an alien, and two others falling in love. If you like fifties horror, you will enjoy this one."
3,50's Sci-Fi Sayonara,"The premise and excitement of KRONOS is ably kept afloat by Jeff Morrow and John Emery, whose combined experiences in this genre carry the story line. Director Kurt Neumann overcame the challenge of a low budget and delivered an entertaining film. Maybe not a 'classic', but certainly an enjoyable rainy day escape."
3,This movie follows me to Park City!,"Every year, during my ski trip to Park City, this film turns up on broadcast TV. Don't look for me there this year, however. The film never loses it's luster as Kronos crushes the local populace with his unusual legs."
4,Fun to watch,"When considering the value of '50s sci-fi flicks, the only valid criterion should be, ""Is it fun to watch?"" (Possible exception: The Day The Earth Stood Still, which actually made sense and had decent plot, characters, writing, and message.)KRONOS is certainly fun to watch. I saw it for the first time when I was maybe 10 years old, and even then I was aware enough to realize it was hokey. But when you have an hour and a half to kill, and some popcorn begging to be eaten, you could do a lot worse than KRONOS.Sure, the science is bunk. But so is most of Star Trek and Star Wars. '50s sci-fi, from the junk on the screen to the good stuff being pushed by John W. Campbell, got me started on the road to studying science. I'm grateful for that."
4,Old enemies meet and only one will walk away...,Ninja vs Ninja in book 5 of the Ninja Master series old scores will be settled in this one...
3,"Decent, but too much missing info","I liked the John Lennon parts of this documentary, where he speaks for himself. But I have to drop the rating down two stars not for what's there, but for what's missing:- Who the heck are some of the people who are speaking so authoritatively about Lennon? While we're given the interviewees names, we're not given their relationship to Lennon or the reason why we should take their information as any more valid than that of, say, any fan.- Where is Sean? He barely gets a mention.- No detail at all about what Lennon did in the time from 1975-1980, except fight for his right to stay in the U.S. He had some rough challenges to overcome in that time, but they're not mentioned at all.For me, this was a decent documentary and worth watching, but not really worth owning. (Oh, and the second ""bonus interview"" lasts literally three seconds before it cuts out. Maybe I'll just return it as defective.)"
2,"Nothing new, digs at Yoko","I am a huge John Lennon fan and I'll put up with a lot of repetition of old stuff to see anything new. This video is a let down, with a lot of chippiness and digs at Yoko that I frankly don't want to hear. And it goes on way too long about the 'Beatles are more popular than Christ' incident. I wish I hadn't bothered with it. Don't waste your money."
2,don't bother,I purchased this DVD because I thought it would have some new info and some good commentary. It stunk. There wasn't a thing new added and the interviews were weak. Save your money.
1,poor,A lot of old interviews from past 80's clips. The main interviewer is just going over what is in the books and other videos. I can recite the same facts as he.If you want the best video get The Anthology Video. Ever wonder why the price is $5.00 for this dvd? Just another company cashing in on the Beatles.
4,what i was expecting.,the item is in great conditions (completaly new) and the packeging was great. It os a very good documentary that i will add to my collection.
5,Get It!,"This is a great little humidor!First it arrived way ahead of schedule and that was a big plus.I've read a couple of reviews saying the hygrometer on this box is magnetically attached, does not seal properly, etc. I think they may have updated the box.I have to say the hygrometer is solidly screwed in, and it is accurate and good quality, not the piece of junk described.The color is exactly the same as the picture.The quality of the box is tops, I really was expecting something on the cheap end but this box is really something, it's heavy and very solidly built.I have only one thing to say about it: GET IT!"
1,You pay for what you get,I bought this humidor and could never get it to work. I went threw many dry cigars before i tossed it.
3,"Looks nice, but hydrometer doesn't work","Buying my first humidor I was looking for something nice, but also something to learn with. This humidor looks nice, but the hydrometer doesn't work. I suggest buying a digital hydrometer with it. The instructions say to season the humidor put a shot glass of distilled water inside. I don't trust that method. Overall I like this humidor, but give yourself some time to get everything adjusted just right. BUY A DIGITAL HYDROMETER AND SOME TYPE OF HUMIDIFICATION WHEN PURCHASING. If this product didn't look as nice as it does I would give it a 2."
3,Good but tippy.,"These speakers are ok for everyday use at a fair price but they are NOTfor the audiophile who likes ""pure"" music. I use mine to listen old time radioshows of the past and they are fine for that.One point...these speakers are feather light on a tiny base and they tip overso very easy."
2,I expected more for $20.,"I must be out of touch with current price trends but I can't believe these were selling for $20! I just tried out a set today and they sounded like they were worth half that. I'm no audiophile and usually have my computer hooked up to an old boom box for sound but these speakers fell below my already low expectations. The sound was weak and wasn't even as good as my small boom box. On top of this, these speakers tip over WAY too easily. For 20 bucks and an AC adapter for extra power, I expected a little more."
4,Altec Lansing speakers,"For the price, these are great. The sound quality is good. As everyone else has said, I have a tendency to knowck them over when I'm moving stuff on my desk around, but I've fixed the problem simply by propping them against my printer. They're VERY lightweight, and I just pop them into my backpack whenever I'm traveling."
3,These aren't your Daddy's speakers,"Ordering and shipping of speakers worked out ok. Not very hard to hook-up either. Sound quality is fine for the price, but don't play any heavy bass on these. Also, dials are small and very hard to adjust. The speakers are so light that they move when you try to adjust the volume. The tone control has very little range from bass to treble.Though for the price you could do worst."
3,OK for the money,"I had a different set of Altec-Lansing speakers, but had to replace them when my dog got tangled in one of wires and the speaker hit the floor. I went to Wal-Mart and got these. My problem with these spkrs. are the control knobs. I have arthritis in my hands and find it difficult to grip the knobs. I will probably modify them in some way to make them easier for me to use. Decent quality volume and sound and ease of set-up make them a good deal."
1,It did not last long,Bought it for my daughter from Wal Mart 3 months ago and used it not more than 20 times. Enjoyed it initially but made no sound in 2 months.
4,great value!,"This is a great little speaker system for its cost. The only problem, and a minor one at that, is that they are a little lightweight and tip over easy. If you place them on a shelf or some place that they will not be disturbed, it shouldn't be a problem. Mine are right on my overcrowded computer desk, in my high traffic living room and they are frequently knocked on the floor. That is probably more because of my rowdy family than anything else.I would definitely recommend this item."
2,"Really cheap ""cheap"" speakers","I'm no audio buff, but these are really bad speakers. They were bought to replace the standard non-upgrade Harman/Kardon speakers that came with a Dell system that finally died after about eight years of daily use. I selected them because they had both a volume and a tone knob. However... the tone knob only lets you select between ""tinny-sounding"" and ""tinnier-sounding"". They have VERY little bass and just have a very flat-feeling sound. Plus the cords were enough shorter on them vs. the older ones that we were unable to place the right speaker on the right side of the computer, and have to live with the stereo channels reversed. I realize I could buy an extension cord, but I plan to get a better set of speakers instead, because these really aren't good."
4,Ok speakers,"I just wanted some cheap speakers. These speakers did it's job. Only issues is when you crank it up, there is noise distortion. But you get what you pay for. What do you expect from cheap speakers?"
3,Yikes! Very tippy speakers!,"Sound is fine; just what one should expect from a pair of speakers under $20. Handy to have an earphone jack in front. My biggest complaint is that these speakers are extremely unstable standing up. I've heard the expression ""like balancing a pencil on its eraser head"" which is an apt description here! As such, you could not adjust the volume with just one hand because it WILL tip over (maybe if you Velcro-ed them down ... hmmm ...). Product design flaw which may not bother some people but I think I will replace them."
3,"Sounds okay, but product design is flawed","These speakers look a lot nicer than the beige things that came from the computer store, and they sound okay, if not stellar.Some things to note:1) They're not very well balanced. They're front-heavy and unstable, so if you brush up against them (for instance, by shuffling around something else on your desk) they'll tip over, which is a pain.2) It uses a wall-brick adapter for power, which is another pain for a gadget-afflicted soul like myself. I have precious few outlets on my desk wide enough to accept wall bricks, and these speakers stole one of them.3) They advertise the MP3 cradle, and how it allows you to connect your player to the speakers using an extra jack. But they don't give you the actual cable to connect the two. You have to buy that separately. In other words, the MP3 cradle is just a piece of plastic.These speakers will do the job, but given their flaws I think the product merits only three stars."
4,Like these speakers,"I like these speakers, but I could not give them five stars due to sound quality. They are very good speakers for the price and would be a welcome addition to any computer or gaming system but if you are really into high fidelity, then these are not what you need."
2,Do not waste your money,"I purchased this item about 10 months ago. I guess it lasted enough for the money I spent on it. Although it enhances the sound of my laptop, I had several problems with it:1. Sound from the right speaker died. I was told by the customer support that I need to pay to send the item back to them, which will cost me over 10 dollars (about 75 percent of the purchase price!). I will throw these speakers away and I am not going to buy this brand anymore.2. No bass!!3. It does not stand still unless it is placed on a hard surface.Please do not waste your money and pay a little bit more to get a better speaker system."
4,good for the price,"I've had these speakers now for like 2 maybe 3 years now, no problem.I only bought them cause my pc i bought didnt have speakers which I didnt know till I got home and hooked it up so I was like I'm going to run to the store pick up some cheap speakers which I purchased these and I've been really pleased with these speakers."
5,Excellent,"I have found these speakers to be EXCELLENT. I bought them so I could listen to my mp3 player while I am working at my computer. They sound good and they work great.The only draw-back I have found so far is that they are very light weight, which makes them easy to tip over."
4,Great For the Money,"Yes, they are tippy. Yes, they're AC powered. Yes, they have knob controls that could be awkward for some.That said, they are lightweight and easy to take along and the sound quality is EXCELLENT provided you are not a ""music lover"" who likes to blast the bass.(Frankly, I don't think REAL music lovers DO blast the bass. And if you do, some nice hearing aids are in your future :))In sum they are a lot better quality than the cheap portables I used to use with my MP3 and my computer and cost no more. Well worth the price."
2,Not good enough for the price,"I got these thinking I would get real Altec Lansing performance, since the brand is known to be really good sound equipment maker. I was looking for good quality sound, deep bass response, but not excessively loud. I would not buy this set again. The sound is clear and crisp, but the bass is not existent. Even for a 2.0 system (not to be confused with 2.1 with subwoofer) there are better speakers out there for the same price, or even just paying $10 more, you will get way better sound. Make the Altec Lansing VS2420 your first choice over this ones and you wont regret spending your money on this."
1,I cant belive this has 3.5 Stars!!,"I got these at Walmart for $15.For $15, there are okay but the sound is really kinda flat and no bass to speak of. The sound also cracks at high volumes.They are also really lightweight and kinda plastic. Also the adapter is actually quite heavy which makes moving them around awkward.If you are looking a really really cheap pair of speakers and dont care about the quality then this might be for you. But honestly I would spend $10-$15 more and get a pair of speakers that actually has some decent sound."
2,Just fine - if sound quality doesn't matter at all,"I bought these speakers for my computer after my old ones died. Since my family's computer has a nice surround sound system for listening to music, it didn't bother me much what these sounded like so long as it did have sound to it. And in this way, I was not disappointed.The sound itself is alright. The static is very, /VERY/ noticeable and very much detracts from most of the things you might listen to. Still, the speakers themselves are not eyesores, and it did survive moving from dorm to dorm as I went through school, so I suppose that's why I had to give it two stars instead of one. And for the money, I suppose it wasn't a bad deal. They were cheap and have worked, if not well.As far as recommending this to anyone else, if you're in my situation and just want a little sound for low cost, maybe you should try these speakers. However, if you like music and find it worth listening to without annoying you, consider something else."
5,Perfect For Any Dancer!!,"This magazine is a must for any dancer who wants to learn more about the dance world ( specifically ballet). It offers excellent tips and information. Every issue is helpful, informative, and fun. An excellent purchase."
3,More labored than the Hoover dam.,"The series of books by Gerald Lund were well-written and it was hard to put them down. The films on the other hand...sigh. The acting was overdone and labored. There were times when it was too sweet (keep an air-sick bag handy). The bad folks were more like comic-opera heavies. Not much intimidation here. The style of language and the emotions behind the speaking appear to me to be quintessentially 1980's...not 1830's. Also, I was amazed at how clean everybody appeared. Not many dirty hands/fingernails...clothes always in good condition. Didn't see many patches or stains. My work clothes do not come totally clean with a washing machine! These farmers must put the washboards on a double spin cycle. The capped teeth were too much.On the bright side the film did take you back to some significant events in the Church's history. You can get an idea of what it was like just being there in the 1820s-1830s (ala 1980s)."
4,I wasn't expecting this,"I don't follow John Smith, However I have read the book of Mormons.I love the story line.I cried, it was a movie on faith and on love."
5,"Work and the Glory: Historical, Personal","A touching, personal portryal of what the early Mormons went through, and of how the non-Mormons reacted to them. The Steed family experiences what many families at that time went through. Those were difficult, changing times for other denominations as well. Which traditions should be adhered to, and which should be allowed to change? Whether you're Mormon or not, you'll gain a greater appreciation for everyone who went through those times by watching this fascinating movie."
5,Enjoyable film - did we see the same movie?,"Well, first of all to the other reviewer, did we watch the same film? Although it's obvious that millions of dollars weren't spent on this movie, I thought it still looked good and was fun and entertaining. If there's any camera bouncing during the ice skating scene, I didn't notice it, and I've seen the movie several times. Although the actors for the smaller parts weren't especially strong, I thought the main actors were good and convincing in their roles. I liked the film, thought the message was great, and have enjoyed watching this with my family."
2,Um - not a big deal,"this I purchased for my teens. It was only ""okay."" It was slow, not one we would watch much. It wasn't realistic to a teens life today, my teenagers could not relate. A one watcher..."
2,A nice try,"In the genre of LDS films, this was a disappointment. It failed to take the incredible story of Alma into a believable modern context. The acting was quite amateur as well. That said, my young kids (10 and 13) like it. I just have to leave the room when they watch it."
3,reviewing the reviewer,"In reviewing keeves from Utah's review, it is my honest opinion that those who cannot spell, should not post reviews."
3,Ok for some Ideas,I thought this book was a little confusing. It gives a little more insight but it's by no means a technical guide for building natural swimming pools. Some of the drawings are helpful though.
2,Disappointing,"I eagerly anticipated this book, since there is so little published information on the subject, but I was disappointed when it finally arrived. It appears that it was never proofread. I read a lot, and this is the worst job of editing/proofreading I have ever seen in a book. This may sound like nitpicking, but there were places where I could not figure out what information the author was trying to convey it was so garbled. It is FULL of typos, grammatical errors, and garbled sentences.From a substantive standpoint, some of the basic info was helpful, but the pools shown in photos were somewhat 'cookie cutter' in appearance, and there wasn't the variety in pool designs I had hoped for. Maybe my hopes/expectations for the book were too high, but for whatever reason I felt let down."
2,Dissapointed,"This book did not meet my expectations, lacking in specific engineering detail and provided very generalized information, bad editing with bad grammar, could have taken one project from start to finish and cover all aspects of the design, photos too small too general and too many on one page with no subtitles explaining what is happening with the construction of the pools. Too much emphasis on project management, plumbing and electrical and not enough nitty gritty on the actual building of a pool.Found the only good coverage was on the plant types and species relating to where to plant etc."
2,A difficult read.,"Definitely not recommended as a primary arranging text. This book could have been written much more simply. Instead of referencing so many of his own obscure compositons, Russo could have illustrated his concepts with dozens of more recognizable works. If you're looking for something else, tryInside the Score."
1,Really??,$15.99 for the Kindle Edition of this book is obnoxious. Why?? Why is this priced so high? Greedy publishers.
3,A little to basic.,"Currently we operate our own cleaning companies. I am always looking for material to help with becoming a better provider of our services. To this effect, I was somewhat disappointed with the generalities of the book. It does not cover how to do bidding, advertising, marketing, setup, etc... in enough detial. For the beginner looking to start a business, you may want to talk with a local or out of town company first. You will learn quickly that you need to put customers first, service with a smile and be willing to be flexible."
2,"Ok, but missing a lot of info!","Overall this book was ok. Nothing special about it. I am a cleaning business owner and noticed that the book was flawed. I would like the author to please show me where a person can get 1 million dollars worth of insurance for $250-$400 as the book states. Most people can not even get insured for that amount in any state until they have been in business for 3 years. The author left out a lot of information and I would not recommend this book to anyone who is serious about starting a cleaning business. The only thing decent in the book is the appendix, but even that is not detailed enough. I give it two stars for effort and because I am a nice person."
4,This is a reference book.,"If you're looking for great prose, go elsewhere. This is not a criticism, for the similarity in description makes it easy to compare places within and among states.The descriptions of the parks and forests follow such a similar pattern that the whole thing would have been presented more efficiently as a series of charts.I found the long-distance trails to be the most useful information, because it's hardest to find elsewhere.I bought this book when it first appeared, and just came back hoping for an update. Many of the phone numbers are no longer valid, in part because of the proliferation of area codes. It would be nice to have the long-distance trail information updated, as well as an update on trail usage in the parks and newer, longer lists of other reading sources.Essential is an accurate description."
5,Awesome!,"I am nine years old and i think this book is COMPLETELY cool. Even though I suspect it was meant for older kids (or even adults) I would definitely reccomend getting it, even though it's expensive. This books has lots of interesting theories and puts a lot of imaginative ideas in your head. In addition, it has amazing pictures! My favorite part is when they use a diagram of dinner plates and bricks to discuss a theory of how dragons flew. I have more to say, but must restrain myself to only two words: ""must buy"". Ben Z."
5,"Excellent, Straightforward, Maturely Written",This book is a most excellent description of dragon anatomy and physiology. Dickinson's approach to the acceptance of wonder and magic by a scientific young man is heartwarming and well written. Giving the dragons their own personalities was a stroke of genius and speaks well of his abilities as a writer. Not just a young adult book but a book to be read by all ages...the world needs more wonder and magic.
5,I did not understand the star system and I give this the highest you can get for the shipping,"I was very pleased by the service of this company. I received the book faster than what the book store did who was here in my city. I plan on returning again and again to this site. Thank you, Thank you"
5,My first lesson in transitions,"GU013 has been given its fair share of reviews, but I thought I would add something to speak to the producers out there....In my humble opinion, this album is an excellent lesson in transitions. When in doubt, I consider this album to be a must-have and go-to reference.This set is not for everyone and even if you are a fan of Sasha's music or genre, it may not hit you at first. I find that GU013 tends to speak to a state of mind - but once you have the patience to sit down and listen, if you're fortunate enough to be in the right state of mind, you may just be in for a treat. I would say this is one of Sasha's most introspective journeys. The selection, tone and approach are very relaxing with subtle shapes bound to move you emotionally and physically."
4,Good historical information,"For those who are studying the history of sexual issues, this book is a good addition to your library. I was especially interestedin Mercedes de Acosta."
5,THE LONELY LORD OF THE SEA,"Wow! This book by Jean-Michel Cousteau & Mose Richards is amazing! The 120 full color photographs in here are some of the best i have ever seen. Truly breathtaking pictures of this awesome predator. This book chronicles the Cousteau team's extensive two-and-a-half years study of the great white shark at Dangerous Reef, Australia. After attracting the sharks, the research team would observe the sharks behavior underwater in specially built stainless steel cages and one made of Luxon(a clear, bulletproof plastic). They would then tag them and attach transmitters to follow their movements and patterns. A new understanding emerges of the great white and it's lonely, lifelong hunt for food."
1,Not about the cage about the animal,"I bought the book being a person who loves zoos and was expecting it to cover the materials, chemicals, theorys, and design/setup of the cage and what plants to use with what lighting but none of the above really appeared in the book a completely misleading title and poor purchase."
3,Not exactly what it says!,"I bought the book in hopes of finding out how to build a terrarium for a specific frog. Instead it quickly ran through a few different terrarium types and how to build them and then went on to describe all the many reptiles and amphibians you can own. I knew exactly the frog I wanted, I just needed to know a little bit more about their enviroment and what types of plants they like. Big disappointment!"
3,More and less,"For each setup, a lot of space devoted to different types of animals and each types general care. Would have liked to have more information on design ideas, construction tips, and maintenance of actual terrariums."
1,A great disappointment,"The title of the book is absolutely misleading!I ordered this book together with 7 others and my hopes in this book was totally smashed the moment I opened and browsed through. It contained very little information on what I thought it should and many of the books I already owned had more info. The terrarium set ups were very unexciting. I tried going through amazon.com again trying to look for more books pertaining to ""this subject"" but much to my dismay, this was the only book recommended. This book contains more on recommendations of terrarium inmates rather than cage construction."
2,Terrarium & Cage Construction and Care,"The book wasnt everything I had hoped for. It did not cover the false bottom method for terrarium/vivarium construction. Seemed out dated and very very basic. Great for ideas, not for construction. Would maybe recommend book for reference but not a single resource."
4,You Mean I'm Not the Only One Feeling This Way?,"What No One Tells the Bride is simply a MUST HAVE for any woman on her way down the aisle or already hitched and pitched over the threshold. Funny, real and insightful, Stark paints the picture of what it is REALLY like behind the veil of matrimony. Based on her own experiences and interviews with a plethora of soon-to-be and newlywed brides and grooms, the book reveals those moments most women have that you would rather not share with your mother, you are wondering about sharing with your best friend, and you would never share with a stranger. The over all feeling while reading the book is RELIEF. You will exhale and say outloud: ""You mean I'm not the only one who feels this way?"" Before you go another day of feeling like you need a guidebook to navigate the waters of commitment and merging your life with someone else's, get this book! Snuggle up to your sweetie, but don't forget Stark."
2,A waste.,"This book starts out with good intentions and then just dissolves into an excuse for the author to gloat and gush about her marriage. She uses other women's marital issues to discuss how good her own marriage is, complete negating the main idea behind the book and patronizing both the other contributors and the reader. I put it down halfway through; I couldn't stand to her about the saintly Duke one more time. A waste of money and a good idea."
5,Great read during my engagment,"Although my wedding date is a few months off, this was a great read during the early and middle parts of my engagement. An easy read, it gave great advice, I especially loved the stories of other women dealing with the different issues that came up during their marriages like sacrifice, control, and sex. This book was a a comic relief. A lot of the stories make you laugh-out-loud (which during an engagement, can sometimes be a rarity with all the planning). Then, the moment you finish the book, your fiance will come out to the pool and say, ""your wash is done and needs to go in the dryer."" You know you shouldn't freak but you want to, so you look through the appendix and think, ""ugh, I have a lot to work on""! Happy engagements to all. I highly recommend it."
3,Average,Not bad... Interesting phrasing and free rhytm - perhaps too much. But the best Smetana's player of today is Antonin Kubalek. Try his Czech Dances and Memories of Bohemia and you'll see.
1,Not the Holmes I Know,"This book is very good, if you don't like the original Sherlock Holmes. It is well written and very interesting, but it couldn't be further away from the original character. Some of my biggest pet peeves include: the dates are all wrong (this book takes place in 1882 after Holmes and Watson have known each other for years?), Watson now has an injured back instead of leg/shoulder, Holmes was tortured as a child and falls in love with some Irish widow. It's just weird, and is not faithful to the original. If you like Conan Doyle's stories, steer clear. If you don't know much about Holmes, go read something else. If you don't like Holmes and want an interesting book, then this one is for you."
1,A Great Disappointment for a Holmes Fan,"Fullenkamp's ""Flying Dutchman"" has a mildly interesting story but is really too fantastical for a true Holmes tale. So much of it is not even remotely true to the Canon that it makes me think Fullenkamp had no intention of paying homage to the Canon. Among many other things, he introduces a element of religion that is not found in any of Doyle's writings. I was particularly unhappy that Fullenkamp writes that Holmes was emotionally and sexually abused by a woman teacher as a boy. Where does he get this stuff? The book has many of the problems with self-published books: misspellings, punctuation errors, use of wrong words, etc. Examples of the latter include ""navel"" for ""naval,"" ""yielded"" for ""wielded,"" and ""exercised"" for ""exorcised."" Unless you don't mind wasting a little money on this one, don't buy it."
5,Las Reglas del Juego,"Los mejores boleros de Osvaldo Rodriguez; los que le dieron fama y renombre, convirtiéndolo en uno de los favoritos entre los amantes de la buena música cubana, recreados con la más moderna tecnología en uno de los estudios de Universal Music Group en Miami, FL. El álbum contiene también algunos temas nuevos creados en el exilio. Excelente colección de canciones de uno de los mejores cantantes cubanos del siglo XX. Tembién les recomiendo su última producción ""Miami"".Osvaldo Rodriguez - Miami"
4,Great how-to fishing information.,"This book has some really great how-to information which will help me improve my technigues and my catch. All of the big names in salt water fishing have a chapter, like George Poveromo, Lefty Kreh and even Mark Sosin. The information has already helped me. I say, ""Go for it!"""
1,Not worth the money,Luckily I rented this book from the local library and didn't buy it as it is truly worthless. I am as green as you can get when it comes to home remodeling and this book didn't provide anything a novice could use. There are many other books that go into much more detail that are worthy of buying.
1,Very Disappointed!,"If you are truly approaching a basement refinishing project from a beginners point of view, this book will be of little if any use to you. Poor illustrations coupled with less than adequate descriptions make it a pure waste of money."
1,Not Helpful,"I have just started a ""finish my basement"" project. This book was not helpful. I am glad that I purchased other books as I haven't even used this book at all. It is extremely elementary and gets into things like what a finishing nail is. I found the other books to be much more helpful in actually helping me know what to do to start the work."
5,"A lovely, clever little romance","This is a funny, lovely romance. So the banter between the hero and heroine is a bit anachronistic. It will also bring a smile to your face. Their back-and-forth is worth the price of admission alone, and Michaels does a good job of explaining why the heroine is so different from her contemporaries.There's a nice mystery (about the hero and another one about the true identity of a secondary character), but it's true there is not a lot of conflict. You know what? Sometimes, in a romance book, I might want to read some romance. This story couldn't be described as a thriller, but how often do you read a romance where the mystery is forced and, by the end, absurd? No problem here! The slight mystery is believable.The only problem I had was the bad guy at the end. I didn't buy his motivation, but by then it didn't really matter. I was already basking in the glow of Gauthier and Ally. Sometimes a funny (not slapstick), clever romance hits the spot."
2,Dissapointed!!!,"I'm sorry to say I began to read this book and never finished. The premise of the book is cute, but the story begans to drag. I quit after page 124. The characters were entertaining at first, but then things grew monotonous and not fast enough for my taste. If I was you I would read something else. I rated it 2 stars because I made it to p.124. and not beyond."
1,below michaels standard,pathetically below her normal standards. boring repetitive childishly inept.
2,Little substance -- or genuine humor,"Michaels can be quite amusing....or she can merely attempt to be amusing. This book is more the latter. It's rather a matter of overkill; she tries too hard. Sometimes it's funny, but it's more often boring, predictable, or silly (in a bad way). Armand's okay; Allegra is sometimes intriguing and sometimes an annoyance. There's nothing new here -- the same old characters and plots, with the exception of Oxie and his pranks, and they are not that amusing.There's not much to like; I had to force myself to finish. Maybe 2 stars is too generous. I'm not sure I'll be able to get through another Michaels books, but I'm tossing this one immediately."
5,Full Western Dress,"Excellent Album. Some of the songs appear to have a 60's sound and like 'Then She Kissed Me' are infact from that era. 'Whatever Made You Change Your Mind' has a 60's feel to it. I feel that 'Longing' has to be the song of the album, an excellent slow country song - should be a No.1 hit. I started to write something on a couple of the tracks but they are all so great that it would have become an epistle.If you're a REAL COUNTRY MUSIC FAN then this is an album for you.Keep Country country - call the rest SOMETHING ELSE!"
5,"Fantastic Follow-Up to ""Reverb Delux""","I thought there would be nowhere to go but down after their last CD (""Reverb"") but ""Full Western"" not only live up to but surpassed my extremely high hopes. The Derailers are a breath of fresh air in the current climate of stale assembly line music that seems to be saturating the market these days. I've only had this CD for about a week and I've probably played it 20 times already. Not a weak song in the batch."
5,Great T,Just what I expected when ordered. Beat the estimated delivery date by days. No problems at all and I'll definitely buy again from this vendor.
3,Buen Producto,"Este disco me gusto era un disco que estaba buscando por mucho tiempo, lo recomiendo y mas si te gustan los exitos de los 90' me hiso recordar mi nines jiji. lo recomiendo..."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!,"Raymond Keene stopped writing original books on chess as long ago as ARON NIMZOVICH: A REAPPRAISAL (1975); ... AND the book sorely needs basic editing which was omitted in the haste of making it. Ask any chess master about this book, if you don't believe me! Get yourself a good book on tactics like the Reinfeld 1001 series instead. (I am a USCF 1800 OTB player.) My rating for this book? ZERO STARS. Save your money."
1,Worst shower sponges ever!,This sponge is actually two sponges glued together to make a big one. Mine fell completely apart within a week. Bad product!
2,"""BOO"" for ""MOO""","I picked up the hardcover at the library because of the cool cover and jacket quotes. Although clever in numerous parts(and Smiley is a wonderful wordsmith), I snoozed through the second half of the book until the pig dies. If you want characters AND subplots, stay with John Irving. If you want satire, check out Florence King."
3,Not as good as...,"I read this as the December selection for my local library book club. I'm a fan of A Thousand Acres (her novel about a modern farm family, which retells the story of Shakespeare's King Lear), and am impressed once again with Smiley's ability to skillfully write a long and detailed story. At times, it seemed there were too many characters, but she managed to tell a complex and (usually) interesting tell-tale story of academia set in the midwest. For the most part, her book was funny and poignant. Not, however, as funny and poignant as another clever book about academia, The Straight Man by Richard Russo, and not as well-titled either. (Moo? Whatever...)"
2,"Boring, boring, boring","I picked up this book because lately I've seen a lot of references to Smiley as one of the foremost writers of her generation. I really don't get it. I found this book tedious, confusing, and frankly just boring. It had the scale, sweep and ironically detached tone of a Tom Wolfe novel, but, unlike Wolfe's books, the story never gained momentum. I dutifully stayed with it for almost three-quarters of the way through, but in the end I just couldn't finish it. There is no denying that Smiley writes beautiful sentences, but that was not enough to keep the pages turning."
5,IT CRACKED ME UP!,"Jane Smiley establishes herself as one of the best living American writers with this book. It is every bit as funny as ""A Thousand Acres"" sad. I went to the bookstore with the intent of reading it in the store over a series of days-- don't laugh, I'm a student. I had to take it home because I was laughing so much that I was disturbing people. Read it and GIGGLE!"
3,Not Jane's best,"I heard Jane read an excerpt from MOO before it was published. I was only slightly amused at her reading, and even somewhat disappointed at the book. Having read all of Jane Smiley's other work before I read MOO, I can say it is not her best work. And for those of you who really enjoyed it, run out and get her other books, you just don't know how good it's gonna get!"
3,Amusing tale of university life.,"It takes patience to read Jane Smiley's MOO, but if you have the patience you will be aptly rewarded. MOO takes the reader on a different kind of journey, one through the minds of all the facets of university life--from administrators to students to the community and even to the lab subjects (Earl the pig). The jumping around from points of view did get a little confusing at times; a character map or chart would have been helpful. I would have liked to see more about the students, also. However, anyone who has been to or even grown up around a college would find this tale amusing; Smiley's wit and storytelling borders on that of Heller's Catch-22 style. It does take some work to plow through the first few chapters, but once you get used to the unique voice, the book becomes more enthralling. I believe this book would appeal to those who appreciate the playing with form and the value of dry wit."
3,"good story that could have been a great book, but......","the first time i started to read this book i gave up after 100 pages because i couldn't focus on it. several monthes later i gave it another try and after getting used to the writers style actually started enjoying the book. a little too wordy and as another reviewer said, too many sub-plots. some good satire throughout."
3,A lightweight,"""Moo"" is certainly not what I would expect of a Pulitzer Prize-winning author. It's not the humorous tone of the book that's surprising, but rather the number of characters and the unresolved plotlines (what ever happened to the guy that was writing the short stories, for example) that make this narrative a bit unwieldy. The book really needed a good editor, because there's some great stuff in it, and when Ms. Smiley gets her satirical jabs in, they're pretty incisive. A far more interesting, ambitious book along these lines is John Barth's ""Giles' Goat Boy."" I'd recommend that ahead of such a lightweight entertainment as ""Moo."""
4,"After first 50 pages, MOO is a rip-snorting laugh riot.",The first 50 pages introduce so many characters and so many subplots that this reader was almost overwhelmed; but I stuck with it and was rewarded by a laugh-out-loud book. It is possible that the most appreciative audience is filled with people who are familiar with mid-western aggie schools and the vicious politics of academics.
2,not impressed,"As others have mentioned ""Moo"" has an unwieldy cast of characters which make following each subplot difficult, as characters often fail to appear again for hundreds of pages. Though some characters are noteworthy - particular the pig Earl Butz and Smiley's grasp of adolescent dialogue is flawless, I wound up skimming until I reached the climax. Personally, I much prefer the author's less bulky books such as ""Barn Blind"" and ""A Thousand Acres"" not because I don't enjoy reading complexly plotted novels, but because I feel that if you have the knack of creating memorable characters, they deserve more ""screen time"" so to speak."
1,"confusing, too many sub-plots, too many abstract characters","I must agree with evmis@msn.com-'s comments regarding MOO. I am also in a book club and picked up this book thinking it would be an entertaining change-of-pace book for the club to read. It's awful ! I have gotten to page 280 (only 157 more pages!)and after reading the reviews (amazon.com) have decided not to complete the book. I lived in Davis, Ca. (CAL AGGIES) for three years and my ancestors are all European farmers so I'm not exactly a ""city-slicker"". This is my first Jane Smiley novel--and probably the last!"
2,"It's hard to follow a Pulitzer Prize, eh, Jane?","I really do not understand how anyone can say that this novel has anymerit whatsoever. Fact, Jane Smiley is an unbelievablygifted novelist. Fact, A Thousand Acres was a wonderfulsuccess and I loved it. Fact, (whether you want to believeit or not) Moo falls exceedingly short of Smiley's previouseffort. Now, whether she was going for symbolism or not isn'tthe issue here. She ends up sounding like a soap opera.Where as A Thousand Acres was genuine and heart-felt, Moowas like a roll in cow chips."
2,Quickly becomes tedious,"Individual characters are interesting at times, but plot movement is very slow. And the review parameters says that I must type 8 more words."
3,Milking academe,"Jane Smiley's satire on political infighting in academia may leave you smiling and nodding in recognition if you come from the academic world, particularly the academic world of large, public agricultural universities. Otherwise you may wonder whether such characters really exist and wonder what the fuss is about."
4,"A week four, but still a good book","Jane Smiley know how to spin a good story and she is a good storyteller even sometimes a great one. She is also a entertainer with a sense of humor and can craft good stories. Moo university and its inhabitants is a charming placefor those who have been to a university: For those who should have liked to studied it may give some glimpse of how universities sometimes may be no more than a place for devious intrigues and plots. Smiley has a wicked wit which in my experience describes (some of) the kind of people one finds in these kind of ""institutions"". Jane has earlier won the Pulitzer price for A thousand Acres, which I also liked. Moo is also a book worth spending time and money on. Though on my harsh scale it gets week 4, which is still very good."
2,Nothing happens,"While Mrs. Smiley does an excellent job of delving into the psyches of the many characters we find in a college setting, I find that her book lacks any kind of plot. I read about 200 pages and kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did, so I finally just put the book down without finishing it."
3,Take Notes,"Moo is an accurate and engrossing portrayal of the hierarchies of both faculty and students at a Midwestern university. However, while Smiley treats the reader to one of her most light-hearted novels, with devious love triangles and surprisingly earnest interspecies bonding, she inevitably creates an enigma of subplots that boggles the mind. With a little patience this is a rewarding read."
1,"Too many characters, not enough plot","This is not a book you can read in a hurry. There are so many characters that I kept getting confused, By the end of the first 100 pages I was so bored that I just gave up on the book.Jane Smiley has an excellent way of describing the lives of these people, but I never latched on to a plot."
1,Lost Interest early,This book was required for my English 350 class and the only reason I finished it was so that I could pass the test on it. There are far too many characters who do not get developed. Smiley attempts to develope these characters even after 300 pages into it. I did not like this book at all.
2,this book is at least 10 years old,This book is at least 10 years old. Why are they trying to pitch Moo as new?
4,Hilarious and satirical,"How can the same author who wrote Thousand Acres flip into the voice behind Moo?? What a phenomenal talent...Moo is a tour de force of satire on life at an agricultural university (known as Moo U., in the parlance) that scathingly leaves no cow pie unkicked. Smiley uses the hypocrisy, prejudice, and self-importance of the characters as a metaphor for our entire society. No one who reads this outrageous novel will ever forget Earl Butz, the Herculean pig that becomes such an obsession for more than one of the quirky characters that sometimes teeter on the edge of caricature. That quality and the fact that the whole charade seemed to go on about 100 pages too long is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.A great book, nontheless."
2,"Great potential, but little reward","""Moo"" begins very well, but it stretches itself too far in an attempt to cover an Altmanesque cast of main characters - only about half of which are interesting. So much time is spent on character development that a story never seems to evolve."
3,Moo,The title and the subject do not match.The name is for a cow not a pig.There are too many people without involvement in the story.
2,Disappointing compared to other books of Jane Smiley,"After having read almost all of Jane Smiley's books I was looking forward to reading 'Moo'- after all the words of praise everywhere.To me it was quite disappointing since I missed a real plot. The characters are not what I would call fascinating and the entire book to me was simply boring. There are worse books around, of course, but I think this is the a bad exception of Smiley's otherwise good writing."
2,Fiction at it's best.,"While the video was interesting, it seemed to border on the rediculous. I find that with every video I buy on the subject of the Third Reich lately, more and more producers seem to be taking more and more liberties with actual historical facts and events. I also found that the black and white film was lacking in quality. To me, it look like fourth or fifth generation footage. I think I'll just switch to another subject matter. Anything good on the Roman Empire?"
1,From silly to stupid,"Watching this over a friend's house, I was left with a gigantic feeling that people love to build myths. With very lame evidence and low production values, this video attempts to build a cohesive myth around the ""indianna jones""-style of nazis, ever-searching for powerful occult artifacts to help them control the world.If taking this comic book concept seriously is one flaw, then the rest are the links to achievements the nazis attributed to any success in this myth. Spend you money on Return to Castle Wolfenstien to get the same concept, but you play a game in addition!"
2,Import Beware,"I recently ordered this item off of another website only to find out that this item is an import. It is made in Hong Kong and shipped to the U.S. After watching a few episodes, i found the dubbing to be a little off and the picture can get fuzzy sometimes. In my opinion it is better to go with the U.S. version for the quality and special features.If you want don't mind the poor quality and off dubbing than this can be a good deal considering the OVA normally goes for about 70 dollars."
3,"Good but can be ""mejor""","I think I can forgive the producer for wanting to stretch out his material in several CD releases, but I was still very very disappointed by the fact that this CD mix could be better. Since I was in college in the 80's I've enjoyed his music. This was my first re-introduction to his material since my days in college. I wish it was better or was my memory always so positive restrospectively? Sevilla and Bandito are my favorites on the CD. But I think I can learn to enjoy and like the other songs. Since my taste in music leans more toward discotech rather than classical, that is one way why I justified my review this CD."
5,Bosé: siempre,"REALLY, buy it! Bosé sigue siendo el mejor cantante en español. Su voz, sus composiciones.... Estas versiones de sus canciones se adaptan a los nuevos sonidos de la música actual. Hace difícil elegir entre las canciones de este disco y sus versiones pasadas. De todas maneras Miguel Bosé sigue siendo el ídolo de siempre, y siempre supera sus discos pasados. Este disco, Directo '90 (en vivo), 11 maneras..., Bajo el signo de Caín, Laberinto valen la pena tenerlos todos."
2,blah movie but amanda peet always awesome,"Blah, dated movie. Amanda Peet is always a spectacular actor, though. Other female costar beautiful and good actor. Would like to see her in some worthy roles. It's not a good movie, though."
5,Good Movie!,"I first saw this movie on HBO last year. As I was flipping channels, I saw a movie with the guy from Office Space in it. Then I saw Cara Buono and her beauty had me hooked! At first I was hooked on just her, then I found myself hooked on the whole movie. I was at first intrigued because he was going out with two girls both named Nina. And then as the story went on I began to like the flick. I recently bought it on DVD also. To me, it's that good. And Cara Buono!!! Oh yeah Amanda Peet was good in it also."
1,Disappointed,"Expensive product that did not do what it described. The tape came off my kitchen floors the same day, so i figured it was not meant for tiles, but they came off the wood just as quickly. Very, Very disappointed with this product, especially because of the quantity i purchased. In this difficult economic times, it is very painful to purchase something to do a job and have to not get your money's worth."
1,Tired version of great songs.,"I listened to 2 or 3 of the songs on this disc and turned it off.It is a tired version of some of the Ink Spots' greatest numbers. These guys must have been in their 70s or 80s when it was recorded. I could not recognize the bass singer--- I don't think he was the original. I assumed it was re-recorded in 1995 but apparently they got some part of the group together, filled it out with substitutes and made this disc. I may be wrong about all this--there was absolutely no information in the disc flyer--but I don'think so. I recommend staying away from this one."
3,A typical Deek Watson group,"These cuts were first released ca. 1960 by one of the numerous groups Deek formed after the courts relinquished their hold on only one legal group. This should answer the first reviewers questions on dating the material. Lead tenor Gene Miller was a bit erratic on his vocal quality, but overall was quite good. A great showman, since I have seen videos of him in later groups. It is true that nobody could paralell Bill Kenny, but can't fault others for at least trying to keep the sound alive."
2,Doesn't glide,I like everything about the iron except for one major flaw--it sticks to my clothes. I have tried different heat settings with the same results. I would not recommend.
5,"Only wish it were longer, but then...","it wouldn't be what it is - an impactful meditation on a life well lived. The last segment when the man is old is a great treatise on old age and quite moving. Why this book has not gotten more press is a shame. It is well written with beautiful prose, enchanting dialogue and wonderful information on the intriguing life of insects. A good balance of science and intimacy, which is difficult to pull off. I just loved it!"
4,Some great highs,"so i got these speakers from circuit city they were about 70 something, i took out my cardboard factory speakers out one was popped , in my 96 cavalier. fit right in, sounds amazing. wanted to get some 6 X 9 polk teh db series also but parents got me pioneer 3 way. all in all this is worth it, basically never distorts, starts hurting your ears before ever distorts."
4,Less Messy Than Regular Bar Soap. Fun To Use.,"The idea for a foaming soap is to reduce the time it takes for washing your hands. Instead of trying to work on a lather, a foaming soap is already made up of soap suds. Foaming liquid soap is generally thinner and watery, or else it will clog the mechanism to produce suds. You can buy refills in bigger containers. Or some people are successful in mixing water and other liquid soap.Dial makes a lot of foaming soap products including Tone. A 7.5 oz bottle lasts a long time. More convenient than a regular soap for your powder room and sinks. It is also less messy than regular soaps. Generally one pump is enough to cover both hands. Just make sure that you cup your hands or the soap will spurt across the room. One wrong pump is all that it takes to learn how to use a foaming soap dispenser."
3,A great place to start if you are counting calories.,"This book would be better if it had pictures of any of the dishes, the only picture is on the cover, also most of the dishes are almost exactly the same. If you don't like green or red peppers or cumin I don't suggest you buy this book!"
2,Out of Date cook book,"Once again and out of date cookbook with very little nutrional information about the recipe you are making. I was so hopeful that this book would be good as with the 400 calorie meal book. But the recipes are out of date. the nutrional facts are just of Fat, and maybe sugar."
5,Pounds Lost!,This was a wonderful cooking tool for me. I love to eat and eat well. It is what I eat.
3,Usable--if you can open it,"In the past, I have been very satisfied with Lexar JumpDrives. Seeing that they no longer create the Sport model, I thought I would try the Lightning. To be honest, almost all usb drives are becoming affordable, putting massive amounts of memory at your fingertips. So, I thought, why not get a sleek looking model that (with a metal casing) is sure to be durable? Lightning fulfills all of these criteria, however, the flaw that I found came right along with its sleek casing: the near impossibility of getting the darned cap off--there is no way to grip it. Seriously, I fought with it for fifteen minutes the first time I tried to use it; not the best for trying to do a quick download."
1,This CD is horrible,"I got this CD after I saw the video for Straight Thuggin. That songs tight, but its the only good song on the CD. The only reason Straight Thuggin is good is because of Twista, he's the man. I tried to listen to this album and had to stop it because it was so horrible. I can't see how anyone could like this album."
3,just aint da same without da tank,"i aint hatin on kane and abel cuz i understand they wanna do they own thangs but dis album just average, the only thing that made brothers keeper tight was da no limit rappers, this aint bad but they aint da same without p, altho only god wasnt all dat tight its aight tho better than this one, rip pac im out peace"
3,What really happened?,"Rise To Power, M.W. Empire is tight and all, but Kane & Abel would have done better on this album if it had NO LIMIT flavor! What really happened, why did they have to leave NO LIMIT...."
4,Why pay,"This is an excellent guide. and as an insurance agent, I wish I could give to all my clients. but why pay. Aetna is offering for free.http://www.planforyourhealth.com/"
5,Daniela Lujan Rulez!,"It has a very unique sound that only Daniela Lujan can achieve, it has very rewarding songs and they are fast and awesome. Beatles22 P.S. Danny rulez!"
5,Everlasting,"A little translucent so if you have a blue, red, or gold phone that color still shows through. Very strong skin, no problems."
3,Almost but not quite,I bought this for my daughter to give her phone a little protection. The holes for the camera don't line up. It's easy to put on and take off so it's not a huge deal but it seems odd that the hole for the camera is on the wrong side. Other than that it's fine. She likes the color.
3,fine,it's fine and helps hold the back of my phone on (it used to come loose). but if you put your phone in your pocket the cover makes it tough.
2,Old guitar player,"Well, this man is obviously a good guitarist. But after watching Joe Pass's DVDs and listening to hours and hours of Joe Pass's music, this product doesn't impress me. Maybe because Pass is very warm in his approach and this man isn't, it seems cold and distant. This approach seems too mechanical for me."
2,"mostly lousy, some good bits.","Helprin is one of my absolute favorites, but not when he writes second-rate material like this. Less a novella than a gloomy satire on...things Helprin doesn't like (media, ideology, computers, progressive education [! ]), this book reveals a great visionary to be a great crank as well. Reread Winter's Tale or Swan Lake instead."
1,Wrong Part,I ordered this stone guard two times both items were for the wrong year carLund 18464 Interceptor Smoke Wrap-Around Bug Shield
1,Save Your Money I Wish I Had,"It seems to me that the author of this book Ms.Porche needed all the help she could get, heavenly and els wise. She rambles at times, with little logic. It is basically Doreen Virtues work very poorly recycled. However if your looking for a book that deals with angelic beings I would highly recommend ""Testimony of Light,"" by Helen Greaves."
4,many streams of teachings from one source,"In the nineteenth century, many Western scholars began to study Buddhism, its texts and sources. For the most part, their orientation was either Protestant or materialist, and they weighed in heavily on the side of the Pali canon and what they perceived as ""original, authentic"" Buddhism. The teachings of the Buddhists of China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and Tibet were labeled as made-up, inventions, or even ""corrupt."" Witness the title of a book by the Protestant divine, Waddell: ""Lamaism in Tibet."" The claims made by the Mahayana streams of Buddhism about their origin have largely been dismissed in scholarly circles - until now. Dr. Ray closely examines the case for the authenticity of the Mahayana and Sanskrit Buddhist teachings, and presents some persuasive Western scholarly support for the claims made by Mahayana believers that their way is also a teaching that comes directly from Shakyamuni Buddha."
3,The Walther pp/ppk history,E.J.Hoffschmidt tells you allmost everything you need to know about the Walther PP and PPK. From produktionstart in the 1920's till now. Varies alterations over the years and all the different special made models for use during WW2. Maintenance of the gun including disassembling/assembling. The book is relevant for the first time user as it does not go into firering details and faultfidings etc. The book was written in 1975 and could need an upgrade therefore 3 stars rather than 4
5,The Cliffhanger,"This book was always keeping me interested, not just about Laurie Jenkins but about Joanna and Penn. This book keeps you guessing until the last page and makes you crazy for wanting to read the sequels. If you love a book that has a mix of romance and mystery than you will love this book because it has all of that and more."
5,Great for experienced programmers,"This is a great PHP book if you are an experienced programmer. It gives a great overview of what PHP can do. It even has sections on extending PHP with your own functions in C. So, if you are an experienced programmer that wants to know what PHP can do this is a great book. If you are new to programming you might want to try this book later."
4,Good receipts to cook PHP programs,"You might find that receipts in this cookbook are useful as well as easy to use. It covers major functions to program in PHP. However, this book does not cover many useful commands, which you might use to make advance software in PHP. This book will become more useful when you also buy the PHP 4 Developer's Guide written by Blake Schwendiman and merely one of the must have books for any web developers."
2,Incomplete,"Bought this book hoping it would be similar to the Perl cookbook - as another reviewer commented, there are ""gaps"" in the content. Every time I needed a solution to a particular problem in Perl, I found the answer in the Perl cookbook. Every time I needed a similar solution in PHP, I found myself using [their wedsite] because the PHP Cookbook made no mention of the problem.Hopefully there are better PHP books out there - I think I'll stick to [the website] for now and get free, detailed help from the PHP community."
1,Don't buy,"The book has very poorly designed code example and a lot of them don't work. I only read two chapters, but I almost pulled my hair off! I'm a pretty good C programmer but this book has nothing to do with programming at all!"
2,Don't bother,"This is a singularly useless book. I bought it because I liked the concept of a ""cookbook,"" a collection of PHP recipes, which I expected to be common tasks. Instead, it is organized by programming concept.The authors say they assume a basic level of PHP or programming knowledge, but their idea of basic is very uneven. You'll find much better resources for common tasks online."
2,NO CD provided for code and examples,"Any coder loves to cut & paste rather than type in the code from the book. It is really a shame that this book has some good examples but they apparently force you to type in the examples by hand. NO CD and as far as I can tell, no website to download from. If you want to read examples then this is your book, if you want to try the examples then find another book with a CD or website support."
2,Really?,"Really?... Really? Am I really supposed to buy another one of these giant plastic devices already. I love round up for taking out the weeds and unwanted grass from around the yard, and the sprayer is great ... WHEN IT WORKS. I am on number 3 and today I see that it has yet again sprung a leak in the handle. They must be manufactured to break after 1-2 years. I don't use it that often, always clean it and use it according to the instructions, yet the handle part always breaks. My husband is mighty handy and has repaired these for me a number of times but duct tape can only fix so much. I am done with it! I am going to put the liquid in a regular spray bottle which costs a dollar."
2,Poor Design In Handles Leaking Failures,"I have three Ortho sprayers and they all leak in the same place on the handles. I'll assume that the handles have a flaw in the injection molding process to hold the pressure when the bottle is pumped up. I looked online for a handle parts replacement. I seen one for 11 bucks I wrote Ortho about the problem, So maybe they will consider changing the design handle. I'm done throwing money away on a bad design."
5,"hoorah, habla",My kids immediately started singing along with the catchy tunes. They sing them as they play around the house. My daughter proudly proclaims she speaks spanish now. This cd is a great introduction to the sounds of the spanish language. My children are toddlers. This is an ideal time for them to learn these sounds as they perfect their pronunciations of other english language sounds and blends.
2,Not really a native speaker accent,I am a native speaker and my baby is growing up in a english environment. I wouldn't buy this CD for her. The pronunciation and grammar is not the best.I guess this is better than nothing so I am giving it 2 stars
5,SERIOUS FUSION SETTING,"The musical spirit that VICTOR is trying to show us is like a 70's challenging mind.In this CD no easy smooth jazz is to be heard.If you want to get back to the times when WEATHER REPORT attracted the listener's ears,try this CD.Then you will realize that VICTOR himself is so obstinate type of guy.Nowadays American musical industries tend to be less challenging and they never make a contract with less commercial musicians.To me , this CD sounds like a manifestation of his genuine musical spirits.Let your heart flow like beautiful poems do."
3,The best Electric Jazz recording in years,"Everything electric played in a Jazz format In the last 7 years, nearly always is a I.E Smooth Jazz format song,which is the farthest departure from great electric musicianship fusion there is. So first, to see a recording with this level of players and cats who play blowing fusion was a great suprise. The playing is hip and blows and has a old school fusion feel. Which has been due for years. Victors playing is tight and precise and grooves very honestly.At times it sounds to perfect.But its one of the few real electric jazz Cds in many many years.If your from the era of true electric Jazz this Cd should touch a spot,its not as raw and passionate as it should be,but its fusion."
5,A high-end bass players album,"This album is a great piece of work by a trueley fantastic bass player. Victor's composition skills are trueley first class and his playing ability compliments them well. I like his use of key changes which sound alot like some of the ones on his earlier album ""Bottoms up"". My favourite track is ""Graham Cracker"" and I enjoy playing my bass along to it. Go Victor! We're waiting for your next album!"
4,The end of a fantastic mini series,Pulls you in and definitely doesn't let you go. Then hits home with it's message. I loved every minute of this series. Brought me to tears. There is definitely a chance that I will watch this again.
3,I expected more from masterpiece,I agree with another reviewer and found the lead actress to be completely uninteresting in this role. When I watch masterpiece theater I expect fantastic acting especially from the lead character and I didn't get it here. However I did enjoy the actor who played Angel and thought he did a fine job. The story is depressing so without fantastic acting I just didn't see the point of watching. The actress playing Tess says most of her lines in the exact same whiny inflection. I found myself confused as to whether I should feel sorry for her or annoyed by her. All in all I'd say it was ok... but not worthy of masterpiece.
3,Pleasant enough,"This adaptation is simply not up to the same standards of acting as most other BBC classics. The filming is lush but the acting, particularly by Tess and Angel is wooden and fails to capture the intensity of the tragedy. The series is not particularly innovative in its approach to the novel. It's not a patch on the BBC adaptations of Vanity Fair, North and South or Middlemarch."
4,very good,"Just finished reading this book. The movie was very close to the original story and done very well. I enjoyed it very much and would recommend to anyone who enjoys period pieces, or just a good story."
2,Melodramtic to the point of laughable,"I was actually laughing at the melodramatic 4th episode. Recognizing that this sort of story may have been dramatic, tragic, and moving during its time, it is just silly now. The costumes and settings were beautiful and seemed representational of the times, and I enjoyed the country scenery. However, all through the story I kept asking myself ""Why doesn't..."" or ""How come [this]. . ."" I just couldn't suspend my disbelief."
1,left depressed,"Watch this series if you want to be left depressed. Rated 5 star, no way. Loved Tess and hated everyone else except Tess's milkmaid friends."
3,"Dark, Darker, Darkest",While watching the first disc I was intrigued and hooked into watching the second but half way through # 2 I thought it would never end. The ending was no surprise but the material was just too heavy for me. I didn't like any of the main characters.
2,Tess of the d'Urbervilles,"I did not care for it at all. Ii was depressing, with a very unhappy ending. Extremely sad."
5,TESS OF D'URBERVILLES,I highly Recommend this video. This video will stick in your mind long after you have watched Beautiful Tess go through the realities of life and reminding all of us that there is no heaven on this earth. Only the dammed prosper here for a very short time. This is a great video for those who still believe in love and living a innocent godly life through all of lifes difficult trials.
2,Extremely depressing!,I was hoping for a lovely story with redemptive attributes. However- this series was the most depressing miniseries! Don't waste your money.
1,Watch for counterfeit,"I was very disappointed to receive a DVD from Amazon that was made in Mexico! The second disc is obviously a counterfeit. As it was the same price, as at other retail stores, I thought it would be of the same quality and stanards that you expect form a true BBC Video.Buy it in a retail store, so not to get ""made in Mexico""."
1,Watch the 1998 version!,"I hated this updated version, it's lackluster and the acting is unappealing and uninspired. If you want to see a screen version of Hardy's tragic love story, go see the 1998 A&E version with Justine Waddell as Tess and Oliver Milburn as Angel, they epitomized those roles for me. Oh yeah, and Jason Flemying as Alec was perfectly wicked in just the right amounts."
4,Tess of the D'urbervilles,"Tess of the D'urbervillesThis was a history lesson from the period and was very good at keeping my attention because I am a history enthusiast. However, the ending was too sad to make it a five star rating."
4,Good for a raining day watch,"Understanding the Era in which Tess takes places, it showed how live of the middle/poor class women can end up. It shows what was socially acceptable between Men and Women. Gemma Arterton does an excellent job and would love to see more of her."
4,Beautiful,Filmed beautifully and the writing was wonderful. This twisted tale was wonderful to watch during a blizzard! I would recomend
4,A very good PC Label Printer,"I bought the QL-550 on sale, so it was not very expensive. The software is easy to use and you can print labels very fast. I would like to see a Mac OS X software version"
1,"Horrible network performance, very poor software.","We bought one for our office, and proceeded to waste a lot of time trying to get it to print as a network printer. Brother's software is bug-ridden, and didn't install cleanly on any of our Windows machines. And online support is a joke. This printer worked fine on one machine, but is a terrible waste of time for network printing. You can't simply set this up as a regular printer, but must go through Brother's proprietary software for every print. A real pain."
1,Don't try this on a Intel Mac,My brother highly recommended this label printer so I bought it. I use a MacBook Pro Intel Core 2 Duo laptop. I employ a Mac specialist/geek who maintains all my company's Macs. When I asked him to install this software he was very skeptical. The driver for the install is very dated. He called Brother and their customer support assured him it would work. This software install made a mess of my computer. I couldn't print anything to any printer because the Brother driver corrupted my Canon and HP drivers. The geek had to spend 2-3 hours fixing this problem . He ususually is able to fix things in minutes. He also reported that Brother technical support was arrogant and useless.BE VERY WARY BEFORE YOU TRY TO USE THIS ON A MAC. I'm sorry I wasted a couple hundred dollars on geek time to fix the mess it created.
2,Software doesn't work.,When I loaded the software my computer wasn't able to find all the components. I keep getting error codes. Tried reinstalling 3 times. Even went to the website to get the latest download and still could not make it work like it is suppose to. Not a happy camper right now.
2,Dymo has a better product.,"I have purchased the QL-550 and I regret it. This device uses only Brother Labels and I can't find any generic labels for a reasonable price. Brother takes advantage of the consumer and for precut labels cheaper than uncut labels. I believe the Dymo LabelWriter 400 SKU: 69100 is a better buy, it has much more label styles and sizes, and you may print postage labels though the labelwriter from many online systems."
5,A very nice label printer,It's compact and it accepts a wide range of labels. It's speed and easy to use. I highly recommend it.
4,Handy Item,Handy device to determine if wind turbine is feasible at a particular location. I leave it sit for many hours and it will record average and maximum wind speed. It would be nice if it came with a pouch to put it in because the wind vanes are vulnerable to damage when carried in my front pocket. Other than that it's well worth the price.
3,Handheld anemometer,"I did not look at the dimensions close enough, the unit is small. I was able to do the job with the instrument and the numbers seemed correct.I am satisfied with the purchase."
3,Not Happy!,"I received the product with a 16 year old battery, after replacing the battery the unit still didn't work. I had to send it back to the factory for a replacement, all of whick took an additional three weeks from the time I received the first anemometer. Works fine now, but what a hassele."
1,SLOOOW response,"First unit delivered had a defective display. The second unit worked. This unit has a 'chill factor' feature. The temperature display responds so slowly it takes at least 30 minutes for the reading to settle from a inside to an outside temperature. (Hope you can stand the cold waiting.) The company did not respond to help line phone calls and 'didn't call back', or respond to any emails. The only way I got a response was to write to the president of the company. I got a response, but 'that's just the way it works' is the response. Please don't purchase from LaCrosse."
4,Nice Equipment,"I have really enjoyed this! Very easy to use and not hard to change settings. I especially like how you can track average, current or max wind speed. Back light button is a real plus."
4,Small and accurate!,Many handheld anemometers are pricy but this one is inexpensive and good. Only real limitation is to the max windspeed. So if you chase hurricanes then you my want something else!Temp seems to be quick to adjust but does not seem to take it externally. Great for outdoor use since it seems to be sealed from the elements quite well. I cant wait to test it out in next year's storm chase season!
3,Well versed in the wind,"While this is a great little product, if you are already well versed in the wind and spend your time checking NOAA's website for forecasts, you might want to consider going with a pricier version. This is a sturdy little device, but it would be great if it could include wind direction. If you aren't good at telling the speed of the wind by feel and need a little help, then this is definitely a good investment. Regardless, my kiteboarding pals have fun blowing into this to see who can create the strongest gust!"
4,Worth the money,"For being so small (3.875"" x 1.5"" x 0.625""), it works great and all of the features work. I would have given it five stars if it were a little bigger. I'm sure the write-up included the dimensions, but the picture ""looked"" bigger . . ."
2,"Useful, but needs strong winds","Fun to have. The feature set is good, while the user interface takes a bit getting used to. The thermometer and wind chill meter are useful extras. Ditto the peak, average and current measurements.The meter works well when measuring winds above 5 mph. However, when trying to measure the wind speed over the pool, the meter sometimes would not spin up. The spec says it can measure down to 0.44 mph. My device won't register less than 1.5 mph, and I have no idea how accurate it is at that point.After some exposure to wind (what a novel concept for a wind meter!), the fan bearings wear out. It gives out a screeching sound in high winds (above 10 mph), and measurements are probably inaccurate.It uses up the battery also when turned off. After about a week in off position, the battery is dead. So make sure to take out the battery after each use."
4,Skywatcher,"I do basic weather watching for the National Weather Service. I have always wanted to measure wind speeds, living on the East coast in hurricane area, but wasn't sure what to get and which one was trustworthy. I was reading about this Anemometer and it appeared to be good and the price was great. I ordered it and it works great so far. Had it a little over a month and it is holding up good. It is simple to use and shows outside temp. readings also. The neck strap I love so I don't have to worry about dropping it. I would recommend this one to anyone who wants to measure wind speeds. The only negative thing I could say is I wish it measured wind speeds up to like 100 mph or more...but I guess I wouldn't be standing up very long if it did...lol"
2,Chilled,"If you need a meter to measure wind speed, this device will do that very well. The wind speed measurements were accurate. If you are interested in temperature or wind chill, you will have to stand outside so long that you will know the values before the instrument tells you. It took about 45 minutes for it to go from room temperature, 70 degrees, to the outside temperature, 45 degrees. It is a good value for measuring wind speed, but you will chill before you get it to measure wind chill."
5,La Crosse Technology Anemometer,This is an excellent product. Very easy to use and understand the different features and scales. I use it for analysing the wind conditions when sailing my RC sailboat and setting up windspeed indicators and windmills.It has all the features most users might need at a very reasonable price.
2,Disappointing,"This unit was not what I was hoping to get. It may be a fine unit for you, but for me, it was difficult to work the read-out and the performance seemed less than adequate. I sent it back and purchased the Kestrel instead."
1,Not too good.,"Purchaced this anemometer for kiteskiing, looking to quantify wind speeds in the 10-20mph range. Did not have any luck getting the propeller to spin at wind speeds below 45mph...which had to be acheived by holding the instrument out the car window. Pretty dissapoing purchace."
2,Not what i ordered.,this item was shipped to me and i discovered it was differnt from the other pair. I couldnt send it back because i bought it for use here in Nigeria. regret buying this and wnt buy any item from the seller anymore.
3,EHHHHH!,This product did not work with my nuvi gps unit the way I expected it to. Not really amazon's fault; more garmin not explaining the compatability very well. I believe this should be used with marine grade gps products not multifunction units.
2,It got me a trophy,"-Image quality is abismal; I expected that.-In low light, it cannot see anything. If the flash is turned on, pictures appear very pink.-I plugged it into my PS3, entered Burnout Paradise City multiplayer got hit by someone, and got a Platinum trophy!-After seeing the PS3-Eye in bestbuy, I bought this because I assumed the quality could not be much worse...I was wrong. It is no good for pictures or video, and the microphone is either non-existant or broken. On top of that, I already have several webcams that are superior to this unit...but none of them work with the PS3. It is BS that sony makes us buy a camera to get a platinum trophy...accessories should not be required to unlock trophies."
4,Good Product But Beware Of I/O Magic Rebates,"The recorder performs well for me and so far has accepted all media I have tried. This is actually an Optorite DD0203 recorder. The only complaint I have is I/O Magic's failure to honor the offfered rebate. I purchased this unit in Aug 2003 and submitted the required items to receive the $30.00 rebate. Inquires to the status of the rebate resulted in ""unable to locate anything in our system"". I have submitted copies of the information two additional times and still no luck. I will never buy another I/O Magic product."
1,"Decent product, but don't count on getting your rebates!","I bought this product in September 2003 and haven't had any major problems with writing DVDs with it. However, I have not received the $50 in rebates that were promised as part of the purchase.When contacted directly via phone, the rebate company (www.rebateservices.com) states that it has not received the requested information even though I have sent the documentation twice. The second time I sent copies of all the forms and UPC codes via certified mail which proves they received them. Two other people I know have had the same experience with this company.Beware of I/O Magic rebates. If you're considering buying this product because it's offering a rebate, think again."
1,A piece,"this burner is a waste of money period. i have two burners in my machine, one old DVD-R Pioneer 2x and just recently added this I/O ""magic"". i can't backup my cd's like i can with my pioneer. i use nero and when i try to make a copy of a cd it says, ""please insert empty disc"". but then when i take that same disc and put it in my pioneer it works fine. I/O magic's products are crap. unfortunately i didn't read the reviews on this drive before i bought it. saw a good price and jumped on it....oh well this will not happen again. be warned i usually don't waste my time writing reviews unless it is something peeps need to be aware of. THIS DRIVE BLOWS"
1,wasted hours trying to get it to work.,this is the worst piece of computer equipment I ever bought. after giving up on my last computer I boxed up the dvd burner and forgot about it. now I have a whole new computer without a dvd burner so I thought I would see if maybe the problem was my old computer like the people at iomagic said. I guess IOMagic was wrong again because it doesn't work in my new computer either.
5,Premier Busy Buddy,My pet is extremely satisfied with this product and I have ordered again and will order in the future.
5,Premier Busy Buddy Gnawhide Rings,Excellent product. My dog loves these rings and devotes his full attention to his Busy Budy Bone when I put the rings on it.
2,ok,"these treats were a good idea however, they have no smell, and my dog is not interested in them at all, i suggest a stronger flavor"
3,Great concept but doesn't last too long,"I like the concept of this toy w/these rawhide strips but they are very expensive and after much wear on the toy the rings do not stay on well so they do not last very long. Yes, my dogs are big agressive chewers but I was thinking the toy would last a little longer. The strips are kind of thin so they are finished with it in about 10 minutes."
2,Picture that Amazon had online was not the product I got.,Amazon had an older picture of this product online. There were more in each package that was pictured and different types. What I ordered and what I got were different. What I got was overpriced for what it was.
1,"Pet treats, baby food, supplements from China not SAFE!","China recently refused to let the FDA inspect pet treat manufacturing facilities. [...]There is no inspection, legal system, or quality control to make sure you do not give your pet toxic rawhide if the rawhide is made in China. There are other treats on Amazon that are American or European made--buy those.I threw out the rawhide rounds and cut pieces of US-made, no toxic chemicals rawhide into rounds to slide on this. I put edible toothpaste (liver flavor--yum! yum!)on the bristles. It is keeping my dogs' teeth much, much cleaner. Great product, but dangerous to give your dog rawhide from China. Over 6000 pets have died just from jerky treats alone."
4,Made in China,"I have been having good luck with these with my two lab mutts. I load a couple into a Busy Buddy for each of them and they love them. I think it helps to keep them busy and out of trouble while I'm away.My only gripe is that they're made in China, and I really have a hard time feeding my dogs something made in China (remember the pet food recall, lead paint in toys, milk debacle, etc..). Hopefully I can figure out a recipe to copy these things because they do work well."
2,This is an extremely small turntable,"I was looking for a tilting turntable for cake decorating. This will work fine for 8 inch or smaller cakes, which cake decorators rarely make, but I have doubts about larger cakes like 14 inch. A two layer 14 inch cake is pretty heavy. The seller tells the diameter in the description and there is a 20% restocking fee plus buyer pays return shipping so it's not really worth returning if you don't like it. So don't buy it if you are looking for something to do stringwork on a wedding cake. I just think it's too small. Since most cake decorating turntables are 12 inches, I just assumed this one was too. It is made of plastic as well but the photo looks like a heavy duty steel. Don't just look at the picture like I did. Read the description before you buy.."
4,Ranked at #23 but...,Even though its probably the worst season ever I'd rather watch this than watch a whole lot of other things so i say if you're a true Survivor Fan than u will buy this season even though its one of the worst so CBS please release the rest of the Survivors please !!!! GO ALL SURVIVOR SEASONS !!!!!!!!!
5,Fan,I have been a big Survivor fan from Season 2. I have not finished viewing yet but fully enjoy the antics of the players.
4,My least favorite season so far...,"But any Survivor is worth watching. Discs played fine. Quality is good. I hate the cases this and Fiji came in. An extra-wide black case that wastes room in your collection. I've taken all my Survivor DVDs and bought clear 7-disc cases that are standard sized, so everything look nice. I hate to cut some of the inserts to size, but it still look good. I wish these seasons were widescreen."
3,Not the greatest season!,"Found this season to be a bit boring...watched it right through, but the contestants were not all that interesting, except Earl & Yauman."
4,"Good plot twists, not the greatest players","I forgot about the early plot twists in this season. It was some of the most interesting that the show has thought up. I've always said, the game is the invisible player. Although the players were not the most memorable, there were some amazing moments in the season.Yua-man selflessly giving up his prize to Dreamz was one, Dreamz showing he was little more than gutter water was another. It actually turned my stomach to watch. He had the opportunity to look like a man of character, but took the low road instead.Overall a good season with some memorable moments. A good addition to my Survivor DVD collection."
5,My 4 year old can read!!!,"Ok maybe she just memorized the words from the pictures. I got it because it was her favorite book from day care. She knows and loves the whole book. However, anything I can do to get her to love books as much as I do is worth every penny."
5,Great classic,"This is a great book for all kids. I loved it, and now I love reading it to my nephew!"
2,Mini book is better,This book was fine its just that we already owned the mini book version. The mini version is a completely different text so it was disappointing to get the full version of the book and it wasn't the same. The mini version has lots of rhyming and is catchy to read. This one has much less rhyming and doesn't follow the same sort of story style as the mini version. check them both out and you decide
3,A little boring,This book is ok but a little boring and too repetitive. I think there are many better options available to buy.
5,Go;Dog;Go,I liked the book. The book was about dogs going to a party. And going around in cars.This book I liked.
2,disappointed,"too small, too comprimised...neither pictures nor text in this format seem interesting to toddlers. colors themselves also not as vivid as in original, standard size format. would not recommend."
2,No story line,My kids don't like this book because it has no story line. It doesn't work in black and white as the text and pictures have connected in the original.
5,"Go, dog. Go!",Great beginner book for early readers!Repetitive words and great pictures help.Highly recommended for prek and beginning of kindergarten.
3,Watch these dogs go!,"Dogs, dogs and more dogs! If you love dogs, you'll love this book. There are big dogs, little dogs, green and blue dogs!It's also a great book for young kids to learn their opposites. I can remember my mom reading me this book when I was little. Then when I started to learn how to read i would practice reading it to my very own dog and as I got better I would read it to everyone who would listen. This book is just a fun book to read and I think everyone should have the chance to read it."
5,"It made me laugh, cry and i would recommend it to anyone","This book is full of such intense meaning, if you read between the lines you can really see that those three magical words mean more then what they are. Green dogs jumping, yellow dogs swimming, it works in som many ways and is so though provoking my life wouldn't have been the same if not for this book. A must read"
5,great,this is agreat book i remembered from my childhood. i've been looking for it for a long time.i'm so happy my children finally have it.
4,Basic Language Vocabulary/Structures for the Beginner Reader,"""Go, Dog. Go!"" presents a simple, although somewhat disjointed, story that slowly, gradually builds toward ""a big dog party"" at the end. The book is filled with basic, fundamental adjectives (big, little), colors (black, white, blue, red, green, yellow), numbers (one, two, three), prepositions (in, out, on, up, down, over, under, around, to), verbs (go, stop), and nouns (night, day). It is a delightful 61-page book for the beginner/elementary reader."
5,A wonderful favorite,This was my favorite book as a child and now my daughter can enjoy it as well. It is a wonderful and fun beginner book to read.
5,Classic Dr. Seuss,"A must read for any one learning to read, learning colors or how to read aloud. Love it. My kids are teens and we still enjoy reading it."
5,Classic children's book,"I have a copy of this book that my father grew up reading. I also read it many times when I was a child. Now that I have a daughter, I have retired that copy (too precious for little grabby hands!) and bought her own. We love this book. The story line is engaging and it can be a quick read when you have a wiggly baby. It is also fun for parents to read as it is funny (""Night is a time for sleep"".. HA! We also love saying 'What a dog party!!') I can't wait for her to learn how to read using Go, Dog. Go!"
3,wish I could read it.,"unfortunately this item, which was used and described in ""good"" condition (and it looks fine) is SERIOUSLY mildewy.I'm asthmatic and allergic to mold. As soon as I opened it up I had trouble breathing. A mildewy book should not receive a ""good"" condition or should come with a proviso about the mildew. The price was so low it doesn't make sense to send it back or complain to the bookseller. In terms of value I got my money's worth because the price was so low. But sellers need to take into account mildew when describing the condition of a book. I'd rather have masses of highlights and torn cover and no mildew. That kind of book I can read. This one will be thrown away or donated - although I hate to give such an unhealthy book to anyone else. And I was really looking forward to reading this book. The worst thing is that I have to buy it again, pay another shipping fee."
5,A Real Treasure,The love letter in the first few pages is beautifully breath taking! She writes extremely well. NPR did a stunning interview with her just a few weeks ago. Highly recommended!
4,A look at the the literary world form a new perspective.,"Well written, good insights into human nature, academia, and the rewards and frustrations of a life of writing for a living."
3,Don't Trust Your Ghostwriter,"Well written, looking-through-the-keyhole interesting, Ghosting made me really uncomfortable. As you read about all the wonderful trips to the Dordogne, about Naim Atallah's generosity -- his name is all over the notes at the end of the book -- about faking his novels, it is good to keep in mind that Jennie Erdal's book exposes the man she ghosted for more than 15 years. Erdal calls him 'Tiger' while making herself sound ever so innocent. Her memoir is a trade-in on someone else's life."
1,Difficult Doll for Toilet Training; Kids enjoy for playtime,"I am very disappointed in this doll. I bought it to use with ""Toilet Training in Less than a Day."" Within 10 minutes of using the doll, one of the rubber legs popped off. Then it took 15 minutes to get the leg back in place and not even five minutes later our 3 year-old daughter accidentally pulled it off while trying to dress her. Our 3 year-old loves to play with her, but the doll is really hard to get to wet in the potty. It was hard for me to squeeze her tummy hard enough to get the water out and it was impossible for my 3 or 5 year-old to do it. We would have been better off saving our money and buying a plastic $5 doll at Wal-Mart that wets easier. I know the cheaper ones tinkle faster, but I'd rather have a small clean-up and faster results, than frustrated little ones waiting for the water to come out."
2,Half the goods!,Looks like a good DVD but instructor refers to included booklet right from the start but no such book is included! If you a a psychic or enjoy getting half the product you paid for buy it! Having to chase sown additional study material seems like the usual nonsense scam!
4,"obvious, but unfortunately, necessary to repeat","This book is a short, easy to read account of countless stories of creature showing us, time and time again, that they are not, as Descartes would have it, mere machines. This does not mean that they, or us for that matter, 'have' souls (whatever that is or means or looks like), but that they, like us, avoid pain, seek pleasure, long for food, companionship, have emotions, and are as every bit as complex as humans. They share this planet with us, and unlike us, their disappearance leads to great disruptions of ecosystems (our disappearance would actually improve the state of the planet!). Nonetheless, this is not a diatribe against humans, it is not misanthropic, it is but a reminder of the fact that we are all creatures sharing this planet with similar goals and desires. It will impress you and move you to act in such a way that you will want to take better care of all of earth's inhabitants."
3,Medium sized,"I have an Canon HV30. This hold most stuff for it. It was the only medium sized one I could find. It isn't the best, but I like it."
3,A raunchy gay adventure,"I found the story of Alex & Greg while on vacation finding a sunken airplane which begins their adventure trying to stop criminals quite lively and compelling. The many sexy scenes are quite wonderful, although after a while I was finding them a bit tedious. Not even James Bond has that much sex! Even so, this book is a fun read sure to get one's blood pumping (and not just from the fist fights)."
5,This book is about life not just date rape,"It is inevitable that everyone encounters obstacles and experiences tragedy in life, after reading this book you realize that the tragedy or obstacle is not what is important but what you do about it. Broken dreams must be restored, we must find hope and strength to fight through hard times and triumph. As you read through this book you experience the writers pain, tragedy, suffering, and most of all triumph and victory. Most people go through life not realizing how powerful certain events can be in shaping their lives by ignoring them and choosing not to face them and resolve them, this book shows a woman who not only faced and resolved a tragic event in her life but how she used it to reach people and give them hope when dealing with tragedy. I suggest that whether you are a woman dealing with date rape or someone that hasn't let go or faced their tragedy and hurt."
4,Beautiful Pictures of Jesus and Healing,"Although this book is helpful and encouraging, it is not a how to book. Me Ra Koh uses allegories to show us where God is in her process of recovery... Her pictures of Jesus are beautiful. I feel this book can be an encouragement to anyone who is suffering deep pain in their lives and are struggling towards wholeness."
2,For the Religious,I am a survivor of rape also. While I admire Me Rah's courage for putting her story to paper I could not asssociate with her much at all. This is a book based primarily or religion and how her religion was a curse and cure for her to get better. I recommend the book for people who have religious connections and those willing to look at thier assalt and recovery through religion...or those willing to view Me Rah's accounts without religious prejudice.
1,Wrong item,"I ordered this part for my 2002 Acura RSX. The amazon system said it should fit my car, but when i recieved it, it had the wrong connector."
2,NOT the TV show!,"This is not the popular TV show, despite Amazon's linking it with DVD box sets of the series, etc. In this film two friends, Eva (Hilde De Baedermaeker) and Patti (Veerle Dobbelaere), are at the wrong place at the wrong time when they capture the suicide of a girl on videotape. Be sure you know what you're buying."
2,pocket shower curtain,"I was disappointed that the curtain was not clear, but opaque. In checking the ad, I find that it noted that the pockets were clear, but didn't state that the curtain itself was opaque, as they should have. I was also disappointed that all of the pockets were 7"" wide and 5"" long, rather than being staggered, with some 5"" wide and 7"" long. I haven't used the curtain, and I'm sure I won't."
4,"Nice, open, punchy sound with impressive lows","Paired with a 80watt/channel HarmanKardon 3390 Amp, these speakers deliver an open, detailed sound. Especially impressive is the low freq. extension and punch.Highly recomennded"
5,Great for smaller spaces!,"I love these speakers, but I am pretty sure they aren't making them anymore. That's alright, since Polk is pretty good about keeping successful speaker designs and using them in newer series. Look for this setup and you'll get a nice sound, best suited for smaller rooms (with a sub-woofer) or as a rear pair in a larger setup. Nice sound quality and imaging at a reasonable price."
4,Good compromise,"These are the substitute for my beloved Magnepans. The Maggies were just too big for my wife to take anymore, in the whole feng shui kind of thing. She wanted SMALL, and these Polks are that. I used to manage a high end audio store, and I knew of Polks' fanaticism for sound quality. These are acceptable monitor speakers, if you don't expect a realistic sound stage in 3D, as you would get with Maggies. You'll also need a separate sub in order to deliver the lowest two octaves. They are fairly efficient, and get to acceptable sound pressure levels with just a few clean RMS watts. They aren't high school party speakers, but they give clean sound to the discriminating listener who needs a small package."
5,EXCELLENT,I USE THESE SPEAKERS IN MY BEDROOM AND THE QUALITY IS GREAT AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH THE COMPANY WAS FANTASTIC.
2,Shakes like the dikens.,"Length:: 0:45 MinsThis rack shakes horribly. It has 5 inches of shaking! Thats far too much. Don't buy if you have a 2in hitch, also, it will only hold one bike on a rav4 with rear tire."
4,rack review,heavy duty for the price. once exposed to the weather rust forms on area where paint was to be.
4,Swagman XC 2-bike Hitch,"Works just fine. Easy to adjust and load bikes. Holds bikes securely. Would like it to keep the bikes a little bit further away from the back of the vehicle as one of the handle bar grips rubs against the back of our RV, however overall I am pleased with the product and would not hesitate to recommend it to others."
5,Great bike rack,Used this bike rack frequently last summer. Holds the two bikes very securely. Easy to get bikes on and off with little effort.
5,Easy to use,"Took a 3500 mile trip with this rack on the front of my truck, loaded with 2 bikes. We had tail winds, we had head winds and we had crosswinds from both directions. We could see the bikes the whole trip. They hardley moved through it all. They were very easy to load and unload. Just buy it!"
5,"Best rack for the price, maybe the best at any price!","This rack is simple, solid, and easy to use. Folds up on the hitch, removed with a single bolt. I can mount my bikes --no-slip solid-- in less than one minute. The ingenious hold-down hooks use the pressure of the tires to keep a little tension on, keeping everything from loosening up. Great design."
2,2 Bike carrier (2 inch receiver),Conflicting pictures on the product mis-represented what I got. The last picture reflected a 2 inch straight bar to the rack (which is what I was hoping for). It was not. It was the lighter 1 1/4 inch bar. Not as sturdy as I wanted. It does not extend far enough out to clear our RV. Will have to loosen and turn the handle bars for it not to rub (terrribly inconvenient). Have not tried the van yet but worry that it will also bump (we have the standard touring handlebars).
1,Does not fit SUVs,"I bought the Swagann XC for use on a 2008 Jeep Patriot. But their receiver bar is too short to allow room for a bicycle to be positioned in the location closest to the vehicle. As a result only one bicycle can be carried in the outer location. I called Swagman customer service and all they had to say was tough luck. As a result, to carry two bicycles I will have to go to Northern Tool and spend another $40 for a receiver extension."
3,"Great product, Cheap paint job","This is a easy-to-use, heavy-duty product, and I would recommend it to my friends. Now, that being said, the paint of finish Swagman uses is junk. Even though I was extremely careful using this bike rack, the paint came off in several spots.(Mostly where the rack pivots and moves...ie. almost everywhere)I live in a very humid climate; so I had surface rust everywhere in less than 24 hours after the rack's first use. Since then, I have sanded, treated the metal, and painted the rack. Now, I have no problems with rust. Great Rack... Cheap Paint Job!"
2,Poor quality.,"Very good design, worked really well for about a month. I use this rack to carry two full suspension mountain bikes. Unfortunately after using it about 5 times it developed a sideways play. It still works but not as stable as when new and certainly won't last long. POOR QUALITY of craftsmanship."
5,awesome,"another satisfied customer. the bike rack comes in good condition, easy to install, almost no need to read the instruction. loading/unloading the bike is a breeze. hold the bike securely. has enough distance from the ground & away from my car. this is an awesome product."
4,Very practical,"The product performed as advertised. I like most the fact that it can be collapsed so I can open the rear door of my camper van.The only problem appears to be that if you have two bikes of the same size, you will have to find a way to be able to use both hooks to hold them down. That may not work under cerati circumstances."
4,good,"this is a good rack for the reason I bought it, to transport bikes around town, if I planed to go on long trips would look for a little more. easy to assymble and mount"
4,"Nice bike carrier, but wish it would swing down with bikes onboard","I bought this 2-bike hitch rack to transport our bikes. I specifically wanted the kind with trays to support the bikes by the tires/wheels rather than the hanging kind. This one wasn't too difficult to set up and seems to work well. It's easy to get the bikes onto the rack. I have a 2"" hitch receiver and this rack, with the adapter installed, seems to fit snugly and doesn't wobble. My only complaint is that you can't tilt the vertical arm away from the vehicle to open the rear hatch (SUV). The vertical arm does tilt but only side-to-side which you can't do with bikes onboard. The listing for this rack implies you can tilt it down to access the rear of you car. You can, but only with no bikes loaded. Not too big a deal for me, but it was a surprise."
5,Love this bike rack,I use this rack with a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon with a large tire mounted on the back and this rack fits just perfectly behind it. The rack is very sturdy and locks my two bikes securely to the vehicle while making stops at restaurants etc. along the way to my destination.
5,I like it,Nice sturdy rack. Especially like the hooks that hold the bikes in place. Work much better than straps and don't look like they will wear out. My wife also found it pretty easy to get bikes in place and locked down. I recommend it.
5,Perfect!,Perfect for my needs. I needed to haul my mountain bike and this product works as expected for a good price. I am completely happy with my purchase!
5,Very good product,"After reading the favorable reviews of this product on Amazon.com, I ordered this product. It was delivered on time and took all but 15 minutes to assemble and install. We use it transporting two bikes on our Honda Pilot. It is well designed and holds two bikes very securely. There is no movement of the bikes when driving and the vertical member can be rotated into horizontal position when you want open the tail gate. I am very pleased with this product."
5,Solid rack,Used this rack for a trip to Arizona and back from Minnesota. Very pleased with how solid it kept the bikes. No bouncing around. Quick and easy loading and unloading the bikes. I am very happy with my choice.
3,"Nice rack, horrible packing, website down.","The rack itself is really well constructed. Welds are thorough, coating is complete. Goes together real easy with zero surprises.However they could have used stainless hardware, and the packing was insufficient. Mine had started to bush through the box and had a few gouges in the powder coat. In addition one of the retaining pins was damaged, I tried to go to their website to email them but it is unavailable. I ended up just buying a new one at the hardware store.The written instructions are clear but the diagrams are small."
3,Great rack BUT...,"I've had this rack a couple of years and loved it. As other reviewers have said, very easy to use. HOWEVER, my bike has been dumped in the street twice. When I contacted the maker, I was told the problem is that I have a woman's bike with diagonal crossbar, that the rack is good only for straight-bar bikes."
5,"Good value, good price","Only one complaint, and it's very minor. The directions for assembling this thing were horrible, but I still figured it all out in about 15 minutes. Be sure to size the tracks to your bikes before putting the screw through that holds the plastic cap on the end, or you'll be like me and have to put them on and off 3 times. This thing doesn't rattle going down the road, and the bikes are stable. It says not to use it on rough terrain, but I do, and have had no problems. Great product."
5,Nice Rack!,"This rack, so far, is an excellent piece of equipment. Extremely easy to get the bikes on and off. I have a Jeep Liberty with the spare tire on the back door and you couldn't fit both bikes on it as is, but I got a hitch extender for about 10 bucks and it works just fine."
4,Great for unique bicycle body styles,"My bike is a Specialized Pitch (Y shape) and the body style did not fit your average prong style bike rack without modifying, so this one is perfect-all you need is wheels. Just slide it in the receiver, lower the arms, place your bike(s) in the wheel well and secure with the ratchet hook. Very quick, lightwieght, easy assembly, looks good. Stores easily too. I really like it.It does rattle a bit, but most do. I would give 5 stars but I haven't had it long enough to ensure longevity yet. The ratchet system may wear down and cause the hooks to slip. We'll see."
4,good unit,"Good bike transport. Solid, holds well, easy to set up and use. Does not handle training wheels on kids bikes too well. All in all, a good solid unit."
4,Good Fit,"I use this item approximately one to two times a week, and drive less than 10 miles to my bicycling destination. For minimal use, I believe this rack to be an excellent item. I made a minor adjustment, adding a couple of washers as spacers, to make the 2"" block fit snug inside the receiver hitch. The rack has light weight construction, concern for heavy use on or off road. For my needs, this rack works great! Bikes are quickly mounted and dismounted. Rack adjusts quickly, and is easily removed."
2,Swagman XC Cross-Country 2-Bike Hitch Mount Rack (2-Inch Receiver),"I would not recommend this product. The receiver did not fit well into my hitch. It was so tight, I had to drive it in with a block of wood. I have not removed it from my vehicle since I first put it on but anticipate difficulty removing it due to the tight fit. The hold down bars pressed my brake and shifter cables against the top rail of my bike and rubbed through the paint- really bad design. The rack might work well for just a sidewalk cruiser but definitely not designed for bikes with brake and shifter cables that run along the frame."
3,"Swagman XC Cross-Country 2-Bike Hitch Mount Rack (2"" Receiver)","Although I've kept this item, there are several problems with this product. First of all the 2"" unit fits sloppily within the receiver. Amazon indicates that people also buy a specific pin at the same time which does not fit (Amazon needs to review their suggestions). Also one of the downright stabilizers that fit over the bicycle crossbar needs to be longer than the other by at least 4"" to 6"", this is a defect from Swagman that could be easily taken care of."
4,Not as pictured,"This Bike rack is great, but Amazon.com needs to update their photo. The model shown in no longer available or in production. The model received has a bend in the hitch mount which raises the level of the wheel holders (terminolgy ?). This is not a complaint though; in fact, it just makes it better."
5,Good product at half the price (or less!),"I looked at better quality (heftier and nicer wheel holders) that ranged from $275 on up to $600. Yes, they are nice, but why pay that much when this functions perfectly fine? I had a universal bike holder before that was such a pain to put on my SUV I actually didn't bother at times to hook up. Now, it's literally a few minutes and you are ready to go! I love that! And taking the bike off are extremely quick! The bikes stay perfectly in place and I never worry about keeping track through the rear view mirror while going down the road.If there's a drawback, I'd say that its that a person could steal by taking each pivot point apart (unless you put locks everywhere). I don't worry about that where I live.I love this product!"
1,Swagman XC-2 Bike Rack,"I bought this product and would not recommend it to anyone. When used as instructed in the manual my bike fell off in the middle of a busy intersection. The rubber tubes are sticky which requires you to use gloves, and leaves marks on the bikes. The tire rails can not be secureded even with a pliers. The red rubber protecter fell of the first time I used the carrier. The lock recommended with it does not fit. When the tubes are secured you need a hammer to get them to move again. Do not use this product as instructed in the manual Make sure you secure your bike with rope, cords or something. Your bike is not secure the way this product is made!"
4,Locking Hitch Pin?,"Great Rack! But after reading some other reviews there seems to be a problem getting the right locking hitch pin.Swagman seems to have their own thread size. (((1/2"" Dia. X 12 threads per inch)))I completely modified my rack, I welded rings in 4 places to lock the bikes to the rack, then I welded a chain to the front, to chain the rack to the hitch. All parts were free for me and I dont have to figure out what hitch pin to use. My other option instead of the chain was to drill and tap the bike rack to a standard thread and then use a generic hitch pin."
3,Not for cars with a tire on the tail gate,"This rack will not work well if your car has a spare tire on the rear door, like my Rav4. The inner bike is very hard to fit on due to the space taken by the tire. I can squeeze the first bike on, but I have to remove the pedal. Like others who have noted damage in shipping, my rack also arrived broken. One of the tire support adjustment handles was broken off. I didn't think it was a big deal at first and I just tightened it with a wrench. But, when I went to mount a friend's bike, I realized the wheel supports needed to be adjusted to different bikes. I adjusted the other side, but it was a pain. Overall this is a good basic rack for the money, but I wouldn't recommend it if your car has a rear mounted spare tire that will interfere with the rack. Happy cycling."
4,Great carrier that grows with us,I bought this carrier to carry my MTB. Later my 5-year old son joined me with his 20-inch BMX bike. Then my wife and my 4-year old daughter wanted to come with us too. So I bought the 4-bike adopter. Now we are very happy with the complete set-up. It is very easy to use and I could store it in the back of my mini van. The only area I see that can be improved is the finish.
5,Outstanding and sturdy!,"This rack is built to last. Very sturdy with quality hardware provided, not the cheap stuff that you sometimes get. Even has some loctite at the end of the mounting bolts to help prevent loosening from vibrations. Great idea to have a mounting bolt with a self-locking nut for the hitch into the receiver instead of a pin. Instructions are straightforward and easy to follow, took me maybe 15 minutes to build. Highly recommend!"
5,The Treasure in the Little Trunk,"Originally written over 65 years ago, this wonderful story was my mother's favorite childhood book when she was growing up in upstate New York."
4,First book I ever bought...,The Treasure in the Little Trunk is the first book I ever bought. I was in second grade and I still remember the book to this day.
2,Poorly engineered recording.,"One of the worst engineered recordings in recent times. Recorded in a very reverberant Church in NYC. Engineering is amateur, and performances are at best serviceable. Stick with the (excellent) Berberian recording of Circles (still available on Wergo). Many other far superior recordings of the Folk Songs on the market; ditto the Sequenza. One to skip. Shame on MODE for this release."
4,Simple Very Simple,"I read The vending Jackpot and my first thought was this book is truly for vending novices. (im not a novice)It didnt get me upset because i like simple reading! The book mainly encourages people to get started with the easiest form of vending on the planet, bulk vending! I say take the authors advice if you are scared to lose money on larger investments such as drink machines, jukeboxes, etc. Also always watch out for scams. They come in all types from scam financing, to selling bad ideas, to companies that change their phone number so dissatisfied customers cant reach them! By the way ""Vending SUccess Secrets"" by BILL WAY (AT AMAZON.COM) is a lot better and more in-depth"
2,What happened after chapter 13?,This book on vending started very well. Lot's of examples and details though mainly on bulk vending which the author had the most experience. For some reason starting on chapter 13 it becomes obvious that the author is taking very generic personal finance information from other sources and simply creating chapters out of it. All in all it felt like I only got 1/2 of a book!
2,The Vending Jackpot,It's a quick and easy read on vending but is rather elementary in it's approach and advice. Perfect for a first step for the truly unfamiliar.
5,Another great Survival! book.,"Death Valley was another great book in the Survival! series by Kathleen Duey and Karen A. Bale. This book was about a brother and sister, Will and Jess Brantcourt. Mr. Brantcourt has decided the family will go west to search for gold in California, even though no one else in the family wants to go. Then he decides they will take a shotcut that will supposedly get them to California faster - one that goes through the cruel, unrelentingly hot desert of Death Valley. Then Pa gets sick from an injury, and the Brantcourts' wagon breaks an axle. Now, it's up to Will and Jess to go find help for their stranded family - for they are the only hope the Brantcourts have left. But can they survive in the desert with only scant food and water, and get help for their family before it's too late? Read this exciting book to find out!"
5,Great Flashcards! some of the best out there,"After carefully reviewing many different brands of similar flash cards, we decided to purchase Abeka since we had done Abeka math books before. We were not sure if these would meet our expectations, however they were more than what we needed. We would highly recommend these. They are more than just flashcards but can actually compliment a lesson if your child is struggling with a concept. They are more than just ""drilling"" or ""reviewing"" a concept but great as a ""teaching tool""."
5,I can't stop thinking aabout it,"While bushfires began to ravage my south-eastern Australian home territory on Ash Wednesday, 1983, I bought this book in Adelaide. For years a close friend had recommended it. I soon discoverd why. Like many of my most loved books or movies, it's a Jesus-story. And this coss-bred baseball phenomenon who becomes a member of the strangest Christian order is as good a Jesus as you'll find. Of course, it doesn't have a happy ending, but it's exhilarating, disturbing, very funny, and terribly sad. I lent my copy to someone years ago, and it never came back. As I can't stop thinking about it, I'm trying to track down a fresh copy. Don't pass up the opportunity to read 'The Last Western' by Thomas Klise."
4,Viennese Treat!,"This is a charming CD. Lars Roos plays these forgotten gems with taste, style and fine technique. He may not quite have as much color and imagination as, say, Shura Cherkassky, but his playing does convey a great deal of charm. One can sit back and enjoy the champagne with this CD! A nostalgic and delightful music. The recording quality is excellent."
2,It Doesn't Feel Like Ellington,"I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that Barenboim just didn't ""get it."" Although I admire Barenboim as a classical pianist and conductor, I had great difficulty listening to this recording. It felt too ""up tight"" for a jazz recording - it in fact isn't jazz, and yet it isn't classical music either. That air of spontaneity you find in the best jazz recordings is missing here. The formality of Barenboim's playing placed an invisible curtain between the music and the listener. His particular skill at the piano, which I've admired at concerts, just got in the way."
5,The Birth of the Senior Service,"Histories of the Royal Navy tend to focus on the great days of Nelson, with some attention to the days of Drake and the Elizabethans. N.A.M. Rodger has crafted a fine introduction to the early days of English seapower-- from defense of the coasts in the days of the Saxon kingdoms to the end of the Civil War. Rodger is always a fine writer, and the world of early naval issues is too often neglected. This is a much-needed update and re-working of the themes in Laird Clowes' classic early 20th-century history of the Royal Navy-- highly recommended."
5,Great Toothpaste,This is a wonderful product. I am a frequent traveler and I need a small tube of toothpaste that lasts for more than 3 days. This is the perfect size for travel plus you only need a very small amount each time you brush. A tube of this will lasts more than a month. Plus it leaves my teeth feeling as clean as when I leave the dentist office.It isn't sweet like American toothpast products so that took a bit of getting used to. Tastes a bit like licorice.
5,Ajona Toothpaste review,This toothpaste is great. I have purchased from Smallflower before and have always been happy with their service.
4,Fabulous toothaste!!!,"I wish so desperately i liked the taste of anise-mint. That is the only reason I'm returning this product. It does a great job with just a dab, has natural,very friendly ingredients, and resides in a very compact, travel-friendly tube! Oh how i wish i could stomach the taste and smell of licorice!"
1,Can't help but be disappointed.,"Don't get me wrong, this bed looks very nice. I have a severe problem with the description though""solid hardwood frame ... base consists of solid wood panels...Solid hardwood construction""Yet, when it arrived, it's made of 100% MDF.Maybe I'm just not up on what can 'legally' be called solid hardwood, or solid wood panels, but I'm pretty sure that MDF is not the first thing to jump into *anyone*'s head when told you are buying solid wood.So, pretty much, you are spending $1300 for a nice looking piece of ikea furniture. Ikea MDF, Ikea hardware, and quite possibly the worst instructions you'll ever see that will make you wish for ikea instructions...."
4,SUMP PUMP DESIGN,"THIS DESIGN PLACES THE PUMP MOTOR ABOVE SUMP LEVEL, THUS AVOIDING THE CORRROSION-RELATED FAILURE PROBLEMS OF PUMP DESIGNS PLACING THE PUMP MOTOR BELOW WATER LEVEL."
5,Beautiful Melodies,"The Grand Vision is a collection of serene, calm and beautiful songs.I listen to this CD and feel grounded and euphoric. These songs are hypnotic and I highly recommend this CD for relaxation, stress reduction and connecting with your soul."
2,Not for the ages stated,"This video says it is for middle school and high school. When I get it home and watched it, it is clearly not for high school students. This is not age appropriate for my students and I regret this purchase. This is not the sellers fault. The video has the grade levels printed on it. This is more for 5th - 8th grade in my opinion."
3,Ready to Write,The video is for 4th grade and up but seems a little low budget to hold their attention. It has a girl and a talking pencil who helps her improve her writing. The strategies are great and is done in a teacher-student conference set up! We'll see if it holds their attention...
3,the entity's pizza,"It's a spoof on Paranormal Activity. It's funny too, I laughed here and there. Was real funny when she just walked through the baby powder on the floor at night and his comments on it. Also when they left a pizza out for the entity and their discovery following after. She also has a sleep walking episode and there's some entity in the bathroom or maybe even the toilet. Only problem with this film is the draging on with certain scenes, like when they brought in the expert to look around the house, who was some stoner dude. That was good but they made the scene longer than they should have so the funniest of it dyed, unless you enjoy watching sonter dudes all day. Also when he went out to buy a weapon from a friend, there was yawn escaping from me here and there. It's a good trial of a film and i'm glad i bought it but it could be better. Lets see the Wayne brothers do a spoof on this."
1,swing and a miss,"I am a fan of the ""Point of View"" or ""Found Footage"" genre of horror. Some, of course, are better than others and other are icons of the field. I thought the idea of a parody of this would be interesting. I'm still hoping this is true."
1,THE MOST UNFUNNY COMEDY EVER MADE,"Not only is this movie not funny, the couple has to be the most annoying 2 people ever. I gave it a half hour and it finally got to the point that I wanted to kill them both just so they would stop talking. This movie is a waste of time."
1,Just plain nasty!!!!,Don't buy this product... You're wasting your time and money! This stuff was so bad I left the rest of the shipment out in my company's kitchen so it wouldn't take up space in my house!! GROSS!!!!
3,short expiration date!,"This would be a 5-star on taste. It's the second time I've ordered a case of the stuff. Yummy! Unfortunately, this order has an expiration date only 3 months from now . . . not good :-("
5,folk art dealer/collector,"all the major folk artists are represented here, which is astonishing since they all come from alabama. this is an excellent companion piece for any folk art collector; it makes you feel like you know the artists. loads of color photos of the actual art work"
1,Very bad construction...,"Avoid buying this item. It looks CHEAP, fells even CHEAPER. It does not protect your PDA at all. Buy an aluminum case from Rhinoskin... Dont even consider this case, I used it for less than an hour and took my handheld out ever since."
5,Very helpful,"I found this book very helpful after our 3 year old was diagnosed with a life threatening illness, PH+ALL. We were able to identify with many of the same experiences as Amanda's family, from middle of the night fevers, failed IV attempts, neglected siblings, friends and coworkers offers of help, and many bills. This book taught us to never turn down help when it is offered. Family, friends, and coworkers want to help and need to. We know that we would feel the same. ""Amanda's Gift"" reminded us to take care of our marriage and our other children. So we kept date night, and made time to relax, or go out for ice cream with our other children.The author talks about his personal relationship with God, how he was able to put his trust for his daughters future in God's hands."
2,Not for me. . .,"The peach flavor, compared to many others, just doesn't do it for me. . .Everybody has their own tastes and this one just didn't work. Like/love most of the others!"
5,"Great tool, great quality!","Great quality tool, but it dose not come polished as it looks in photo. Flat finish, but great tool, and great seller, offered to take back, told me they don't come polished anymore, I polished it myself on a buffer!"
2,"Aside from the unissued demos, the remainder sounds like a bootleg","Aside from the rare and interesting demos and practice tapes, the actual released tunes are horrible sounding, All of the cardinal sins are here; chopped off beginnings, sgtereophonic surface noise against mono music, horribly rechanneled tracks and worst yet, two tracks completely out of phase - when you press the mono button on them, the sound largely disappears.Amazingly unacceptable sound...they should have known better."
5,"Dear diary, i'm a review","The fifth book in the nightmare room series is one of the best. The story is good, and so are the descriptions. I highly recommend it to R. L. Stine fans. also please tell me if this review was helpful thank you. I give this book an A-"
5,this is the best book in the series,"this book is very exciting.its filled with twist and turns and the ending is unbelivable!when i first read it i couldnt put it down.i wanted to no what was going to happen at the end and when i did i was shocked.i picked this book to do a book report on and i got an a!it is a very interesting book ,i highly recomend it for children and teens,which i am!"
3,It Was... Okay,"This book is about a kid named Alex Smith who finds a diary in an old desk. Later Alex finds that all of the entries were for the next day. They are also in his handwriting but he didn't do it. Soon Alex realizes that the diary is never wrong. And it doesn't always predict good things.I think the theme is do not trust what everyone tells you. If Alex would not have trusted the diary, the bad things would not have happened. I like hat Alex likes to bet, but I don't think he should take it so far. My only question is why it started all over again at the end. I think that horror fans would like this book because of the semi-scary events. The ending was not well written, and it wasn't very good."
3,The Diary is never wrong.,"This book is about a kid named Alex Smith who finds a diary in an old desk. Later Alex finds that all of the entries were for the next day.

2,Hmm,"Well, first of all, I love books by R.L.Stine. But this one was one of the worst. The book title gives a lot away; the ending was confusing and disappointing. There are lots of ""predictions"" in there that makes readers dread if the main character is going to die or not, but well, I thought it was rather forced in. The characters were not involving. I especially disliked the very first part about ""camping."" You should skip this one if you're reading all of the Nightmare Room series. Not enthralling or involving."
3,love these books,the nightmare books are great they better than the goosebump books. dont get me wrong i love goosebumps too. anyhow this one wasnt the greast but it wasnt the wrost either the premise is very intresting and there are some suppesful parts. good ending too.
2,"dear diary,what the???","dear diary, a few months ago i read a book called ""dear diary, i'm dead.don't get me wrong, it was okay but it had : * a terrible plot. * a horrible ending. *and,it never even tells you what makes the diary ""tick"". it's about alex,who gets a new desk for his room.when he opens the desk, he finds a diary.the diary tells him of what will happen the next day.he's a bit skeptical at first, but alex is a betting kinda guy.so, he uses the diary to win bets & money.he also uses it, to one-up tessa, his betting rival.but it soon starts controlling him by making him do crazy things. it is o.k.,i'm not trying to talk you out of it.but if i were you, i wou l'd read ""the howler"", which is also by stine. i give it three stars. well diary, that's all for now.i have to go. sincerely, pingpong><>"
4,The birth of Kool,"ok I bought this on DVD and I had once seen it as a small child and loved it. OK here is the truth the movie made 100% no sense. But it had really cool effects and kept me entertained.Sadly the female lead Maria Penchukas died a couple of years ago but this is more than an awesome so-called ""B-film"" it is a cult classic. Trust me if you are having second thoughs about buying it, you will be very happy if you did."
3,damn good FX,"Okay, this thing is terribly low-budget and strictly amatuer in the acting department. But the special effects are pretty darn good and some of the creatures are creepy. I loved this one as a kid and think it's a terrific entry in any horror aficionado's collection."
3,Considerations,Interesting. . . a long way from Connecticut Avenue to Connecticut State. Not Considerations or the Cockroaches Ball but 3 points none-the-less.
2,"Too much, too fast","This book presents too much information too quickly. I'm a music teacher, and if I were to teach somebody banjo, I'd use a different book. The material just isn't sequenced properly. All of the tunes are fairly advanced, and there's not really any songs that a beginner could play. All there is for beginners is boring, repetitive exercises. The material on chords and music theory progresses far to quickly for most newcomers to the subject to understand. Earl Scruggs is certainly a master of the instrument, but his pedagogical techniques leave much to be desired. The book might be useful to somebody who has some background in music and some experience with a stringed instrument, like guitar. It also has a lot of good information about the instrument in general - it's construction, history, etc. One other thing - the binding makes it almost impossible to lay the book flat, which is very frustrating when you try to put it up on a music stand."
5,Earl Scruggs is the master of the Five String Banjo!!,"I bought this book a few months ago. I know nothing about music or musical instruments, so I decided to take lessons at the local music store. The instructor said he uses the ""Earl Scruggs and the Five String Banjo book for his lessons, so I was already prepared for the class. With his help, the book is going much faster and I love it. It is written in tablature as well as musical notes.I am playing the forward and backward rolls and can play ""Cripple Creek"" pretty well. I bought a set of metal fingers (which is a must) It's a tough instrument to play and takes a lot of effort and lots of love for the banjo. Nobody loves the banjo more than Earl Scruggs. If you truly want to learn to play, his book is the best."

2,Not as I expected,"First off I would like to say, if you are new to programming with games, this book is probably not the best. It lacks a lot of explanation and throws a lot of source code at you, which I thought would be handy but turned out not to be. One tutorial in the book was actually very sad and didn't explain how to install JOGL. Anyways, find another book if you want to learn something good."
1,Don't waste your time,"As someone who used to see 60 or 80 movies a year and now sees about 10 because they're so mediocre these days... ""When Strangers Appear"" really goes on my ""Why did I even bother?"" list. The story makes NO sense. The New Zealand-based filmmakers didn't bother to correct minor details -- the story is set in Oregon, yet they call a doctor's office a ""surgery"" and a parking lot a ""car park."" The heroine made me absolutely crazy with her wandering from place to place rather than going to get some help! She runs a diner and a motel (apparently several miles apart) out in the middle of nowhere, and says she's had no customers in a while, yet she can afford to keep both of them open? Worst of all, the writer/director never explains who the bad guys are, why they're so uptight about that CD, or why they're willing to murder to get it back. I could go on and on ... suffice to say I really thought this was a serious waste of time."
3,Three stars for Josh,"Why are movies still being made with ""they want this disc"" as the central plot? Josh Lucas is the only reason anyone should watch this movie."
1,when strangers appear,purchased dvd because brother in laws house in NZ used in movie. good movie. happy with promptness of arrival from the US to NZ . dvd in excellent condition.
1,"Review of ""The story of sumo"".","I am very disappointed : Having the intention of buying this product, I found no information at all about its contents.Miguel ZauschkevichSantiago, Chile"
4,Superb,"I enjoyed the book (and the movie) immensely. For all those who are still squabbling about the ""historical accuracy"" of the film, please, just enjoy it as it is. Plenty of films that have claimed ""historical accuracy"" (aka The Prince of Egypt, Gettysburg) are only about 50% accurate, having been modified with ""artistic license."" Though Anna and the King might be almost all fiction, it's an incredibly moving story that is a wonderful reprieve from the ""sex and violence"" movies of our times."
4,Anna and the King,"Anna and the King is a great book. Though the story is mainly false, it gives the reader a good example and feeling about what the story is about. It deeply explains the way Anna feels about not being able to be seen by the king the minute she gets there, and it expresses her reactions to the parts in the story as well as the king's. If you want to see the movie, read the book first!"
3,Good Size but Hard to Position,"This mirror is a good size to give you a good view of what is behind you, but it is hard to position properly to actually see behind you. It may work better on a different style bike but for my cruiser it seems like the arm needs to be a bit longer so that it can be positioned more easily."
1,metal attachment ring too small,"I really can't see how this would fit onto any but the narrowest handle bar. The ring is impossibly small. I couldn't even get it 2/3 way around my handle bar which is an average size diameter, not large at all. So it's just sitting there in my garage, useless and a waste of money."
4,looks,Looks good. Purchased for a friend for her balloon tired bicycle. I think she'll like this. Nice large mirror surface and like the reflectors.
3,Okay,"This needs an extra angle bracket / gimbal to get into best rear viewing position. Otherwise will have to cut into rubber bike handle to move mirror out, so my body is not blocking the view. Also, the clamp meets up with shifter.It is certainly better than a small circle, but may end up buying a mirror that attaches to helmet, if I decide against cutting special hole for mirror post (it does not insert into the hole at the end of handlebar)."
5,Kudos,"The great Bob Krogstad arranged this album but, sadly, was uncredited. He is without doubt one of the greatest arrangers in the business."
4,Great Christmas Companion,"I originally bought this item because I love the song ""Mary Did You Know?"" Natalie Cole's voice only made it that much more enjoyable. The best surprise on the CD was a duet with her father. I really love the sound of their two voices together."
5,Great book,"Loved the story and characters, I loved sophies spirit and attitudes, and jacks personality. The storyline was just perfect, I laughed and cried with the characters."
4,Nice to know there are Happily Ever Afters,"While I have enjoyed most of her books, Ms. Crosby scored a hit with me with 'Happily Ever After.' The author has drawn her romantic pair as warm, funny and, well... just plain sweet. Jack, the hero, was a NICE hunk and Sophie was a beautiful woman (who didn't know she was lovely) coming into her own. I really thought it was a nice touch at the end of the book to have Sophie writing her parents with her recipe for happiness. If you want a really enjoyable read that will make you laugh and make you cry(and not because it is sad), don't overlook this book. It's well worth the time."
1,you don't get what you pay for,1This item is made in china and absolutely looks like it. Poor quality. 40 dollars for cheapy made dented product. The top didn't line up with the bottom. The sellers was not helpful and refused to pay return shipping. I paid 12 dollars to ship it back. He would not send a return label and did not make it easy to return. He did however say that he would not charge me the 25 dollar restocking fee. Who has a $25 restocking fee on a 40 dollar time anyway. Crazy!!! I will never by from this guy again.
2,Travel Bar,Travel Bar was of no use as it does not fit standard 75ml Bottle sizes and is of poor quality. Would not recommend.
5,Great Trilogy,"This is the first Blue Ray movie that I purchased and I definitely was not disappointed. I enjoyed all the Matrix movies very much prior to this purchase, but Blue Ray makes the movies come more alive and realistic, almost like it's taking place in your living room."
4,"A must have for Matrix fans, but don't expect a collector-quality case","I received the product in a timely fashion. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. I was surprised to see how cheap the actual product looked, though. The cases for the discs were very cheaply made, and two of them didn't even snap shut. It's a must have for a Matrix fan, but if you are overly concerned about the quality of the case, then I might consider passing on it."
5,Suberb,"I'm huge fan of this trilogy but only now I got this collection. Excellent package, sensational quality of Blu-ray and a lot extra content, much more than 2-disc special DVDs. The Matrix was my first DVD and now, my first Blu-ray disc. I could not be happier! This is a must have!"
2,"Ditto, only want the first movie","This series was great for one movie, the first one.Never seen such a promising storyline get ruined so fast in the sequels.Who helped those idiots write the first one? There has to be a ghost writer no one knows about.Not worth the money as a set.5 stars for the very first movie."
4,Finally....,"I just discovered they released the first film remastered, and in a keepcase to boot in 2007[Edit: new cover-same old crappy 1999 master]the movie seems less solid than when I first viewed it at the theaterand talk about dated-WHY on earth do they use analog rotary phones to travel in!?Even when the movie came out-those where long gone"
1,ONE WORD...... DEFECTiVE SET.TÜRK MÜTERiLER DiKKAT,I BUY THiS SET TWO TiMES.IN THE FiRST SET REVOLUTiON DVD iS NOT WORK.I TELL iT TO CUSTOMER SERViCE.THEY TELL ME TO SEND iT BACK.SENDiNG BACK FROM TURKEY COSTS NEARLY 100 USD.OK I THiNK AND BUY ANOTHER SET.I CHECK iT BUT NOW THERE iS 2 REVOLUTON DVD RELOADED DiSK iS ABSENT.MAY BE iT S MY LUCK BUT THiNK TWiCE BEFORE YOU BUY iT ASPECiALy I M SAYiNG THiS TO TURKiSH CUSTOMERS.
1,Tim,"I was very dissatisfyed with the 4th movie it was a waste of time and a cartoon???? the others were just like what I have on my DVR now. I thought the 4th one was a regular movie not this crap.Thank You,Jon T. Davis"
4,"like the movie, have one q","i like the movie, but not much since it's quite confusing. therefore it's 4 stars.one q though, i already own the separate release of matrix (matrix, reloaded, revolutions) and i am only interested in the movies, not the extra material/features. i notice that in this box set, there are lots of extra features. in this box set, are all the movies (matrix, reloaded, revolutions) the same as the separate previous release one? or they have some extra minutes (NOT extra material/bonus features, i hope i do not confuse people here) or not (sort of like lord of the ring extended version vs theatrical version)? if the movies do have extra minutes (extended version from the previous release), then it's worth to buy. otherwise, i m happy with my movies as i m interested in the movies, not extra features/materialif some matrix fanatics can answer this q, i'll really appreciate it. thanks"
3,Cheap,"Cheap box -- it was already falling apart when I got it. I bought it on here b/c the ones in the store look like junk. I thought the Matrix would have been a bit more high def than what they produced it as, but on a good TV you can completely see the non-HD in all its glory.Movies are good, though. And the animatricies are pretty fun as well."
5,Incredible.,"These are some of the best HiDef discs yet released. The TrueHD audio is fantastic, and the clartity of the 1080p/24 video transfer is simply amazing.Frankly, with this set I have come to the conclusion that a good home theater with HD DVD is capable of better reproduction than you can get in any but the best commercial theaters."
5,Great collectors item,"In my opinion, there are the matrix fans, and THE MATRIX FANS. If you fall into the later, this is a must have item. All the movies, the inbetweens and production clips. Beautiful case."
4,Complete Matrix collection,"The matrix collection has a lot of discs, perfect for die hard fans. Extra discs go into detail of the origins of the story and themes showed in the matrix. Good to have to complete your movie collecion."
3,Brilliant but annoying.,"For one person who loved all three person, I am suitably annoyed that all the extras are only coming out under this set. What about those of use who bought the 3 movies, Matrix Revisited plus the Animatrix on DVDs?That said, I'll probably get it for the philosophical commentary tracks when it does come out. Although the Wackowskis' refusal to talk about the films themselves is reaching a new level of annoying-ness.$60 for all the films and plenty of extras to keep you glued to your chairs this Christmas so you don't have to talk to your families IS a good deal... if you haven't already got the DVDs.As far as the extras, these films did break new grounds in cinematic special effects and computer conceptual designs. A true film guru should get this set for those little featurettes alone. If however you don't like the films or own the films already, or you don't watch the extras on the DVDs, this would be a waste of your hard earned cash."
2,Problem with the double-sided media...,"Ordinarily i would have given this box set 5 stars, but i've taken it down to a 2 because of the questionable quality of the double sided HD DVDs used. The Matrix plays fine, but Matrix Reloaded refuses to start up 80% of the time and Matrix Revolutions has never successfully played through the part of the movie where Jada Pinkett-Smith is trying to pilot the hovership to Zion whilst outrunning the sentinels (it always freezes and distorts). I own about a dozen other titles and these are the only two that give me problems. I should point out that all my other HD-DVDs are single sided.I am using the Xbox 360 HD-DVD player."
4,Good Deal for a Matrix Fan,"Purchased this collection for a Christmas present. He wasn't a big fan of the Aminatrix DVD, but the rest of the collection was at an excellection price."
4,Best trilogy ever!!!,I really like the first matrix but it lost some of it's touch when reloaded was released. I actually googled a couple reviews about it and found a really good one based on the whole trilogy:www.associatedcontent.com/content.cfm?content_type=article&content;_type_id=3298The author really has a good honest opinion about the whole thing and writes out exactly what I was thinking but couldn't quite put my finger on how to say it.
2,Not what I expected...,The picture quality for this is not much better than the DVD. I recently found out that not all blu-rays are going to be blu-ray quality picture because not all movie where shot in HD. This just happens to be one of those that did not.
5,Exactly how it was advertised,The delivery was speedy and arrived before Christmas. The package was in great shape-Brand New with no problems at all.
4,The Matrix Trilogy gets the treatment it deserves.,I would like to thank Warner Bros.(who is well known for making some of the worst dvd releases) for giving the Matrix its proper dues with this amazing ten disc set. Now the two sequels can be appreciated with the animatrix and enter the matrix information available all in one set. Now people will be able to fully see the genius of these films and how through provoking and deep they really are.
1,"Rip-off/deceiving, you get two movies only","Well, it is more deceiving than rip-off (can't beat the price even for two movies) but it is also very disappointing to see that one of the discs contains identical movies of the other.While both are labeled properly (inner circle had the right inscription) the movies are identical so this must be a manufacturing problem - the ""first"" disc had Matrix 1 on the first side and Matrix 2 on the other side while the second disc was identical to the first even though it was labeled correctly.I would suggest to stay away from this because you'll never know what you will end up with. Other comments say they got Animatrix and Matrix 3 twice.Also, there are only two discs so the data is recorded on both sides. This is a big minus for optical media. It stores more data on a physical disc but at a cost of fingerprints and scratches.I bought this brand new from Walmart and it already had tiny scratches.I'm going to return this and get a refund!"
4,Great deal,If you're a fan of the Matrix this is a must buy. It's very modestly priced and you get all four movies.
5,What can I say,It is the best HD presentation (bd or hddvd) of all at this moment. Makes you think about HD lord of the ring and star wars.
3,Good but BR quality not the best I've seen,"Good but BR quality not the best I've seen; Probably due to the many dark scenes throughout the films; other than this, Amazon was excellent in delivering the product. Viewed on PS3 and samsung 120hz 650 series LCD."
5,GREAT PURCHASE,"If you love Keanu Reeves, or the Matrix, you will love this collection. You will not be dissapointed at all with this."
3,Exactly what it says it is,"There's no reason to spend more money on the Matrix Box Set unless you want all of the additional footage from behind the scenes ETC. This has ONLY the movies and that was good enough for me. In my opinion though, only the first Matrix is worth watching more than once. The 2nd and 3rd one are flashy with effects but the stories suck. There were no problems with the discs. Buy this if you just want the movies!"
5,I'm 30 and loved(s) it!!,"If you don't understand the plot of The Matrix movies, don't blame the movie... I'm 30 (not 13) and thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy. I've seen it several times, and everytime I watch it, I understand the plot a little bit better. It's a very complex plot which can not be fully understood by watching the films only once.Personally I think the 'let down' experienced by some viewers after seeing Reloaded, is due to the fact that they expected the same mind blowing experience delivered by the first movie. Unfortunately, we got used to the new type of special effects the Wachowski brothers introduced in the first one, therefor the less than mind blowing effect...Also, since it was the second of a series of three movies, Reloaded didn't really have a beginning or an end, as in the first and last, which leaves the viewer feeling dissatisfied.The Matrix will definetly stay my No 1 for a very long time. The movie that will displace it will be something very, very special."
4,The Ultimate Matrix Collection [Blu-ray],"All the matrix movies and animation are together. I like the compact cases for the individual blu-ray disks, but don't like the outer box, which is weak and already broken."
4,"Beautiful video,,,, sound a tad low","Stunning Blu ray movie(s)video is clean, sharp and full of depth. Watched via my projector and ..WOW!!..way better than the dvd versions..A+Sound/audio (dolby digital/ Tru HD)seems a tad low and not as ""thundering"" as the original dvd...all this means I had to crank up the volume a bit..anyway well worth the price.I have not watched the ""extras"" in this set yet so I cannot rate those."
4,Matrix on HD DVD,"The reason for buying my hd dvd player was this pack, the image cuality is awesome but the only desapointing point is that the animatrix DOESN'T come on HD.Really i expected a little more because of the title ""ULTIMATE MATRIX COLLECTION"" but it's a good choice."
5,Dont pass this one up!,The Matrix trilogy has AMAZING picture quality and sound!!! Sure to be your new demo disc!!
5,A must have for Blu Ray Owners,"If you have a blue ray player then there is no movie you can get to better showcase the superiority of blu ray than especially the first installment of this movie trio. The special effects in all of them will show people why they too should buy a blu ray player but the first movie is of course the best of the three.Awesome looking, better than theater quality from your own home. Blu Ray, as Howard Hughes would put it, ""it's the wave of the future""!"
3,Bad commentaries,"This is isn't every Matrix fan's dream at all.I' am not interested in the games, but like to listen to the Brothers' commentaries. Were are they? Do they feel ashamed, or afraid to speak, like Spielberg does?It's a pity. I wait for another release, it isn't over yet..."
5,Specifications,"Can Anybody say about subtitles, languages and another specifications about this DVD Box? Generally some little people speaks about that, and it is a important info. Thanks."
5,Keanu at his best,"If you are a fan of Keanu this is a must. I was lucky enough to get this 5 blu ray disc set when it was a gold box deal of the day for only $25 bucks. There are some places in these movies you can see the graphics are out dated for today's technology, but what what more can you expect for a 1999 and 2003 movie. Each movie has it's own slimline case."
3,How come mine came with 4 discs? It says on the cover that the 4 film favorites dvd only comes with 2-double sided discs.,How come mine came with 4 discs? It says on the cover that the 4 film favorites dvd only comes with 2-double sided discs. Did I received pirated or copied DVDs?
4,Loved Every Single Movie,A wonderful furturistic romp through the concept of Messianic deliverance (complete with a Cyber Judas). Highly recommended and if you didn't understand the second movie (which is the general complaint I read about all the time) I suggest you watch it a couple of times until the core idea behind it sinks in.
5,"Great collection for fans of the movies, and anyone who likes movies in general.","First of all, I have been a fan of the Matrix films since I saw the first Matrix in theaters. It blew me away that anyone could create an action film with such a compelling and creative story. Not only are these movies fun to watch, but they are also insanely well shot and the music and actors are brilliant in my mind.Every disc in this set is packed full of features, ranging from the interesting commentary tracks, with one track on each film from philosophers citing how they enjoyed the films, and another track on each film from critics who did not. That is quite a gutsy thing for any filmmaker to include negative reactions to their movie right there for anyone to experience.This collection is definitely worth paying for, even if you own the originals."
1,R I P P E D-O F F!,This was supposed to have 2 DVD's with the three movies of the trilogy. But what i received was the first two movies twice.
4,3rd Disk Bombed Out!,Buyers beware... issues playing this HDVD boxset on the XBOX360 HDVD player. Matrix Revolutions won't play at all! (third disk)... all other disks are fine and after a bit of research on the internet I found many have had issues with Matrix boxset on the 360 ... Hopefully a 360 update will be provided soon till then don't expect it to play flawlessly if your luck is anything like mine. With the exception of the disk that won't play the other movie recordings are superb.
5,Great!,"Having everything crammed into a little box is extremely convenient. Each DVD case features a cool picture. The amount of special features is astounding, and none of the critics hold back (many people commenting the movie actually insult the third one)."
3,All disks now working in Toshiba HD-A20 with 2.5 firmware,"UPDATED Oct 5, 2007 - Four months later and my issue with the Ultimate Matrix Collection has been resolved. Amazon had graciously sent a replacement set that had the same 4086 4203 error code, and Warner Brothers just sent a mailer for me to get yet another set from them. However the ultimate fix was getting the firmware updated in my Toshiba HD-A20 player. Al HD-DVDs now play fine. I'm bumping the stars up to 5.Original Reveiw (June 9, 2007) - Dont know if it is the player's fault or the disks, but two of the three disks give a 4086 4203 error on my new Toshiba HD-A20 player. A check of various HD forums indicate many people are having issues (at least those using Toshiba players), and they are resolved by replacing the disks (sometimes many times)."
5,Sci-Fi at its Finest...The Matrix has YOU!,"first and foremost let me start off by saying this price for this box of movie gold was too good to pass up. All three Matrix movies the very much slept on Animatrix and 2 DVD's based on the philosophy of the Matrix. I never watch the special included discs but this box set was so good I wanted more after watching everything.Video transfer onto Blu-Ray at 1080P is amazing..crystal clear, detailed and very much the definition of HD. Audio is coded in Dolby TRUE HD and sounds magnificent on my home theater rig.Buy this as a gift or for your personal collection..it will not disappoint."
1,Disappointed,It really wasn't ideal to be forced into purchasing all 3 movies at the same time. That really bugged me. I was able to find the set at a local best buy for $50. I'm not sure if it rang up wrong or what. The video and audio is amazing non the less and was totally worth it to see the first movie in high def. Animatrix is in SD... bs but oh well. Drops the set 2 stars for me since that was the only highlight besides the first movie in this over priced set. Also being forced to buy the last 2 movies was another 2 stars. They always find a way to push these down your throat. I'm gonna sale the other 2 on ebay and try to recoop some cash. Oh well defiantly disappointed with this whole mess. I hope an end draws near for this format war and movies won't be so tossed together and features will become standard.
1,the worst set of movies ever made,"The matrix trilogy is the most boring dumbest and overrated movies ever made. The special effects looks horrible and I almost thought I was watching a movie from 1976 or something. That's how bad they are. The actors are lame and the story is boring. I HATE THESE MOVIES, don't bother with them."
4,Possibly Thinking of siting this one out?,"This seems like a sure thing to the novices out there. Except I can't stop thinking about that Bran New Super Duper Micro Chiped ready Hyper Byte Rate Star Trek Librarian (Mr Atos)disc out there;with PoP out than Pop out Eyes for the Merlingion Doll,I dunno, is it maybe just Me?"
1,is it worth $40 extra ?,"Most standard dvd players nowadays have a feature that lets you upscale a standard dvd to 1080p. So you can enjoy your old dvds in maximum resolution on a high definition television. You can find the standard dvd versions of these 3 movies, and buy them for about $40 grand total. So you would be paying an additional $40 to own this blue-ray set. It's NOT worth it!!!"
4,**The only thing I would gripe about***,"I love this set....evrything is great except for one thing that was left out. On the Matrix Reloaded 2-disc set that was released a while ago......there was the ""MTV Movie Awards"" skit with Seann William Scott, Justin Timberlake, & Will Ferral that totally rocked. It was not inculded in this massive 10-disc set for some reason. Why? :( Please tell me why :("
3,Just what you would expect.,"Nice box, but I do not like the plastic cases.For some reason, image quality of Animatrix blu-ray is not as good as it should be.Best deal for the Matrix Collection on the market, anyway!"
5,Great Deal,"RedSabbath (Eric) put it best, read his review...If you are just looking for the movies, this is for you. It is literally a copy of the movie discs for each respective movie pressed on one side of the dvd. If you are expecting lots of extras buy the more expensive collector's edition or shell out the money for the blu-ray series. I did not have any duplicates as some have complained, and there was not a single scratch on mine. If you really only want the movies this is a great economical choice."
4,USED BLUE RAY?,FOR BEING USED THE DISKS WERE IN PERFECT CONDITION. THE ONLY DOWNFALL WAS THAT THE BLUE RAY PICTURE WAS SO GOOD THAT IT EXPOSED SOME OF THE OLDER SPECIAL EFFECTS
4,I like the sequels,"These all look great on DVD, I think Revolutions probably profits the most from the new format.It's true that the sequels - Reloaded and Revolutions - do not hold a candle to the original film. The Matrix could be watched over and over again, but with reloaded and its sequel, there is not much rewatch quality to them.What went wrong with the sequels? TOO many characters, way too many.The Wachowskis got the mix just right with the first film, but the sequels feel as if you are being introduced to a new character every five minutes which gives you no time to get to know any of the new additions to the series.Although, the sequels do have their strengths and the idea of Smith taking over the matrix and looking to expand beyond it is a fascinating idea.These are great films, and I really hope this franchise is considered as the next big Hollywood reboot."
3,COOL BUT STILL NO DTS?,We all know matrix not only has great visual special effect but also a very solid audio. Why this collection still don't offer dts to the follow 3 matrix film. That's might be the only thing i complain about the ultimate collection other then that seem to be very cool set for matrix maniac out there.
2,more than i bargained for,There was no photo of this item on the Amazon page where i purchased it. Had there been i would have kept looking for the collection in a box.Seriously.
2,No Animatrix in HD !!! What a Rip Off !!!,"I purchased this set over the cheaper version as it came with ""The Animatrix"" (a movie I already own on standard DVD) well guess what, the Animatrix on this so called ""Ultimate Collection"" is in standard old school crappy def! Needless to say I feel ripped off. Oh and to rub salt in the wound I could have got the cheaper version and downloaded Animatrix for free from Xbox Live Marketplace! Way to go guys, totally screw the folks who pay more for a box set.This isnt the ""Ultimate Collection"" as all movies are not in HD !!!! (I dont care about the stupid making of 1000 hours of babble stuff) If someone starts a petition to get the HD Animatrix (as a free replacement) Im sooo signing it this sucks."
4,"It's nice, but could be better...","Ok, this was one of the firsts blu-rays on sell, but it's very nice, even the package very poor. What I can say, it's MATRIX!"
2,Matrix,Overall the package looked brand new. But once I got to the 3 rd movie it skipped a lot. The CD was scratched. Even with cleaning did not help. I would have prefered the package being a little worn and the movies be perfect.
2,Nice shiny package for garbage,"Now this is the ultimate collection for those people out there who still think that these films (at least the second and the third) are ""intelligent"" or ""superior"" or ""philosophical"".At least they have the guts to include a commentary track this time. Not by the Wachowskis, though. No surprising move. I know, let's do a commentary track by ""philosophers"". Let them explain these ""films"". We can't.The only saving grace are the other extras, I suppose. That's why I give this set two stars instead of the one I gave to the first DVD releases.""Matrix Revisited"", is it? Why didn't they revisit the script? Or the characters? Or the effects? Or the music?To all the people out there who haven't seen these fillums: don't let them fool you!"
2,Amazon please make Warner split the pack,"Let's be truthful, everyone only want the 1st movie on Blu-ray. You can keep the sorry two sequels. Amazon please help us and make Warner split the pack."
1,Never recived the product,"They charged me on my card but i Never recived the product, n thers no any link to report or contact the cliente, what can i do?"
3,The Ultimate Matrix Collection,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my best friend, so I have not personally seen it. However, he has raved about it."
2,Why wake up?,I thought the original Matrix was a brilliant movie. The second and third went a long way to destroy the story. If my options are:A) live in a dream state and have my energy used up by computersorB) dance in a mosh pit in a cave at the Earth's Core with scantly clad smelly peopleI select A. Plug me in. Let me dream.
1,WHY WHY WHY WHY???????,Why did I buy this awful and poorly done box set. Why did I spend a lot of money on [...]. The movies alone is great and it's good to have them in one box. It's nothing new here only old stuff in one cool looking box set. I WILL not make that misstake again ever. Don't buy this box set.
5,Excellent Collection - Just ignore the 3rd movie,"Sadly the Matrix is one of those series which progressively got worse. It's not as bad a drop off as going from Terminator 2 to Terminator 3, but the 3rd movie in this trilogy is really weak. The first two movies plus the extras and the Animatrix are worth the buy though, all of them are very good in terms of audio/video quality and the extras are always worth a look.If you enjoyed the second movie at all, I would go with these over the single discs. If you can't stand the 2nd or 3rd, just pick up the first one on its own."
5,Ultimate Matrix Rocks,Better than ever on Blu-ray if you love the Matrix movies you will love this set.
4,One of the best Movie Trilogies out there,"This is a must have for Sci-Fi Movie fans. Although, the picture and audio quality were not as good as other Blu-ray movies."
5,Great product,The product turned out to be great. I am happy with the arrival and condition of the product.
5,The Matrix Trilogy-Amazon,Great video transfer to Blu-Ray and HD audio is excellent. Good purchase price and definitely worth owning if you are a fan of these movies. The concept of a reality that is completely computer-generated while your electro-chemical energy is siphoned off like a human battery is freakin awesome! The final battle with the machines in Zion is mind-blowing.
5,Great service!,"This is part of a christmas present, so the movies have not been seen yet. However, in accordance to delivery... Very fast! Product is in original package! Great service!"
5,The Matrix on Blu Ray,"The description is a little deceptive, the Blu Ray / DVD count is wrong, but the content it describes, is what comes with the discs so it can be overlooked. Pretty standard packaging, Cardboard box with the thin plastic disc cases that have each movie separate, and some bonus content. The quality is what you would expect as far as Blue ray when it comes to video quality and sound. If you love the Matrix, your going to love this."
4,"It's been done, don't you people read comics?","This is without doubt an outstanding, breathtaking movie. But I don't understand why no one mentions 'Magnus, Robot Fighter'. Humans, being used as batteries by intellegent robots, dates back to the 1960's. And revisited again, in a new way, decades later...again in 'Magnus, Robot Fighter'. I'm not putting the movies down, but the concept isn't as original as most imply. I would find it VERY difficult to believe that the comics did NOT inspire the movies to some degree. But I endorse BOTH. Please, read the comic. The brief older storyline, and the much longer one decades later. It's ALL good, just different twists on the same topic."
5,ULTIMATELY MUST HAVE!,"A must have for anybody that own a blu ray player! The presentation of these movies are of DEMO QUALITY to show off your home theater system. Pictures and sound with crystal clear quality! Its classic mind blowing masterpiece with the concept that changed the movie world since the first Matrix released in 1999. Some lovers and haters for the 2nd and 3rd installment but overall this is the best box set ever released to date! With additional discs on the production and animatrix, you can't go wrong with this box set! Nothing to complain... JUST GET IT!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"Extremely disappointed! I'm a big fan of the trilogy, but this so called Blu-ray version is nothing more than a regular DVD. There were moments when the movie had qualities of a Blu-ray, but would return back to the disappointment that it originally was.I put in another Blu-ray movie to see to see the difference in picture quality, and boy was their a difference. Try playing the Bee Movie right after you just watched the first couple of scenes of the Matrix, and you'll see the disparity of the two films. Seriously save your money, this is just another scheme to rip off the average household of its hard earned money. Another gimmick by Corporate America to make more money, and keep their stock holders happy, not worth a penny.If your intent on buying the film contact me and I'll gladly sell it off to you on ebay. Terrible.....just terrible."
1,The most overhyped series,The first Matrix was awsome but you get to the last to and something seemed to be seriously lacking. The movies seemed very rushed together. The fight scenes are cool but how many times do you need to see that damn stop motion that was supposedly made famous by the Matrix wich is a lie it was first in Blade. The story of the last 2 movies sucked. Now the box set of the DVDs comes out? What excatly was wrong with having the DVD's the way they were? Are you scared that Lord of the Rings and Star Wars DVD sales will blow your crappy movies out of the water? At last those are good movies
2,No More Matrix !!!,"This is boring, 10 DVDs no way I'll sit down to watch that [...].When The Matrix came out I kind of like it, but when the sequels came out it was just too [...] much for me, like Star Wars, I get bored really easy with that kind of movies. But don't get me wrong in here only if you're a huge fan of the Matrix go ahead and buy this [...] . . ."
1,Can't Play,"Is anyone else having this issue? I'm trying to play it on my HTPC and so far this is the first blu-ray movie I have come across that I can not play. At first I thought it my be something with the blu-ray live, like with Iron Man, but when I disable my internet, still doesn't work. When I try playing the movie I can see the warning sign saying do not copy, then the WB logo intro and then the loading screen, but after that it goes black and doesn't respond. I upgrade my blu-ray players firmware, but that hasn't help either. Does anyone have any advice? The blu-ray drive that I'm using is LITEON DH-401S"
3,High-Definition DVD technology,"This is coming out next year. In a couple of years all of the DVD movies will be in HD format. You have to wonder if it would be worth waiting for this collection to come out in HD, which it will-guaranteed."
3,The Matrix Reloaded Revisited Bonus Disc Query,I am interested in purhcasing this set. I noticed the Matrix Reloaded Revisited bonus disc has 21 featurettes. Does anyone know if these are the same features on the original theatrical DVD release or if these are additional and new features for the Ultimate Matrix set? The original release has only 6 or 7 features. Thanks.
5,"Great Movie, Shipping is Terrible","I purchased this box set on Dec. 29th, with the priority 3-5 day shipping. I find out that this movie isn't shipping til Jan 2 and will not be delivered until Jan 9th!!! I paid the xtra money to get it shipped priority, and i get reduced to UPS's media mail service!! If i knew it was gonna be shipped that way, i would have used the Free Shipping option!! I for one will be requesting a refund of my money paid for shipping, as i am not getting the service i paid for! I should be getting on jan 3rd or 4th at the latest, not a freaking week later! That is just BS!"
5,A lot of cry-babies on here,"I didn't buy any of The Matrix movies because I knew this was coming out in December. For those of you that did, quit complaining, and for those who don't like The Matrix shut up already! All of those that hate on this film couldn't have done it yourself or even imagined it. This collection is for fans of the movie so leave it at that. By the way, if you havn't seen Ghost in the Shell, rent it or buy it. That's where many ideas for The Matrix came from."
3,"it looked good,but.....",The picture Quality of the movies was pretty good. I was unimpressed with the audio quality. Most of the characters whispered throughout the movie and the audio was not enhanced for the blu ray collection.
4,Good Taste Great Price!!,Best Action Movie at all Time. Keanu is Great!!Blu-ray disks are very good!!Special Disk is superb!!!Boxset is nearly poor!!
5,The Ultimate Matrix Collection [Blu-ray],"Come on, I believe more than 99% of the people buying this have already seen the movies so I wont say anything about it.* The set is well done, nice and sexy looking box.* The video/audio quality is amazing!* You'll really get what you paid for :)."
4,ok,I was a little disappointed not so much because of the graphics not being up to par but because they did not fix the cg especially in reloaded. The movies are still as good as ever it is just that in reloaded you have a lot of outdated cg and it shows but I believe that it would do this with either hd or bluray. Part three is the best looking out of the three and has less cg or it is just more up to date and harder to follow. Over all I would probably not get this as a whole set if you already own it but if you do not it is worth the money if you are going to purchase it for the first time.
4,Great,If you've only seen the first movie then you're missing out! The whole collection answers the questions that are running ramped in your mind after the first movie.
5,The Matrix Awesome,Every guys movie is in this collection. Everybody likes the Matrix everybody has seen the Matrix so everyone knows it's a great buy!!!
5,Finally in High Definition,I am surprised some people can give this product less than 5 stars because they only like (or get) the first movie. I was worried that something was really wrong with this set.I am only worried of the subtitled options. I can't find if the movies have english or spanish subtitles.
4,Thrilled,"My husband was so excited when I bought this for him. It has all these extras that I didn't even know about. My only complaint would be that the cover started to come apart after only a few days, I just glued it and now it looks perfect again."
4,Best Collection Sci-Fi!!!!,"There's notthing to say about the movies. Fantastic, Revolutionary are just few adjetives to them. But this box set... It's my dreams realized since i knew hid-def movie and sound. Bluray brings me the real sensations of bullet time, watching on 1080p.The only thing i don't like was the ""slim cases"" of blu ray and dvd discs. The worst case to blu ray disc i ever see. That collection deserve a digipack (or digibook) case. And more: the third dvd disc was supressed on just 2 dvds (1 disc with 2 reader sides). In my point of view, the Achilles' heel of the collection."
1,I would review this product IF..,"... Amazon EVER ships it to me. My order was placed October 9 and has had the delivery set back TWICE and is now ""promised"" between Nov. 26 and Dec 1. What the hell is up with that? The freakin' ad still shows copies available now! I am pissed and disappointed to say the least. ""Apology"" emails aren't cutting it AMAZON, I want my order, you have my MONEY. Ship the product. NO MORE LOUSY EXCUSES!"
2,OVERRATED SERIES MEANT FOR THE INTELLECTUALLY CHALLENGED,"Part 1 was good, part 2 was a regression into silliness, and the last was a total disaster, unless you were under 12 when viewed. The chain-smoking cleaning lady masquerading as the oracle was one of the dumbest character inventions of the millenium, and she or the attempt at a movie could not be taken seriously.How anyone could give this series more than 2 stars leaves me bewildered, but I guess it is a sign of intellectual decay in this great nation. It seems that moviegoers set the bar extremely low when it comes to action movies."
5,"Great Collection, but...","I'll make this quick. It's a great set and the entire discs should be explored except for the commentary by the critics. These morons have no concept what the movie is about or the philosophies behind it. Nothing but a bunch of yes men agreeing with each other and then contradicting with what they talked about earlier. Skip it, and move on to the commentaries by Dr. Cornel West, and Ken WIlber. They not only give insight to the philosophies but enjoy themselves while doing it. Enjoy!"
5,AWESOME!,"I've been fan of the series since '99, watch it on cinema 5th times, then i watch the animatrix online, play the game, watch the other two, and was looking foward to buy the Matrix Complete Collection on DVD, i didn't find it anywhere, so the time passed the technology changes, and i got this on my hands, it was a closedeyes order, i couldn't lose. Then after a long time, the package arrived, the Cover of the BOX, the BOX, the Disks, all the stuff, worth every dollar and time of shipping, i'm watching it right now with a cousin, he haven't seeing any, so now, watching it in HD for the 1st time, just imagine, he should write the review, anyway the content of the disks, the commentaries, To every fan of the series is a non-regret buy, so, if u think u're a huge fan, u should get it, and u'll get a lot of time of Matrix fun_"
3,I do not think it means what you think it means.,"This is addressed to the guy who said this was the ""Penultimate Set!!!"" Apparently he thinks penultimate is some superior form of ultimate. Well, my friend, penultimate actually means ""next to last."" Before you use a word, look it up in the dictionary. When you use a word incorrectly, all of your subsequent opinions become less valid."
5,Relapes,"This work book is one of the best I have found, I'm do AOD and CRISIS counseling. this booklet help me in groups and one on one assistance, it also help's set goals and principes."
1,another useless work book,WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!SHOULD ONLY BE USED WITH A THERAPIST. I HAVE NO USE FOR THIS PRODUCT.I DO NOT WISH TO WRITE ANYMORE ABOUT THIS.
3,Not what I originally expected but a good tool,This product has been a good compolement to my recovery. I like the thought provoking questions throughout the workbook.
2,Relapse Prevention Counseling Workbook,"The contents of the book was helpful; I'm familiar with Gorski's work. However, the condition in which they arrived was bad. The workbooks looked like they had been put in water and dried out. Unfortunately I was unable to inspect them until the evening of my group. I used them but comments were made about the condition. I won't order from that distributor again."
5,Lite-On Is Write-On!!,"After my Yamaha EZ3200 bit the dust after a year (run don't walk away from any Yamaha cd-writer....they no longer manufactur cd-writers and will not provide any support for them), I needed a quick replacement. Enter this Lite-On CD-RW. Not only is the cost terrific, but it is was a breeze to install. I've been using this writer and Nero software for about 2 months now. I've just made it through my first 50-pack of cd-rs and have not burned one coaster yet! I would recommend this writer to anyone looking for a effective and inexpensive replacement for their old or burned out cd-writer.****May 2008 Update....still burning strong!!!****"
4,Works well,Works well and had no problems with it! I would recommend it to users for their cd rom burning needs
1,Must have got a lemon,"Bought this unit on newegg.com for a much better price. I had an easy install replacing my old cdrom/dvd drive. I was very pleased for two weeks. I only used the thing about four times. About two weeks after installtion I tried to open the tray and it didn't open. I also have a zip drive on the secondary IDE which was also dead. I took the drive out and put my old cd drive in and everything worked again. I emailed liteon support. Ten days later they responded. They gave all the right steps to reinstall, but this unit is dead. I wouldn't buy this one again."
3,No Sales Receipt with Order,I received this drive from Circuit City and there was no sales receipt with the order. I notified Circuit City that I would like a sales receipt in case I needed warranty service. Needless to say I never received it.Hasta la vista Circuit City--I'll shop elsewhere from now on.
3,"Nothing original, often idiotic, but fun to watch","Ever see ""Big Trouble in Little China"" the John Carpenter flick staring Kurt Russel? This movie basically takes Russel's wise-cracking character, Jack Burton - jokes, attitude, and all, and puts him on this space prison. Let's ignore all the idiotic plot holes (like simple forensics clearing all charges - being vague to avoid spoilers) or launching an attack from a distance to avoid defenses. Of hundreds of people having no problems without food or bathrooms.... Or perhaps 20 cops and hundreds of weapons. The list is seemingly endless.Special effects are decent, acting is totally B-movie, the script is awful, the premise is idiotic and the ships look like a 12 year old did the design work. All that said, it's fun to watch a couple of times, but not worth buying unless it's on the dollar clearance rack."
2,I don't remember it,"I don't remember it. And i only saw it a couple of weeks ago. So either my memory is locked out, OR, the movie was forgettable."
2,I waited and was ok with it when I watched,"Special effects pretty good, story line = same old Hollywood. Handsome guy, ends up saving pretty girl. They fall in love which was very contrived. If you want to watch this same movie different setting with Harrison Ford it was called Air Force One a few years ago on a 747 instead of a space station. Had an element of ""Big Business"" putting profit ahead of everyone's safety in a egregious manor... who would have thought... The scene when the bad guys find out one of the hostages is a VIP has the exact same script as other movies of the same caliber. My final thought; don't pay for it, wait and see it on your subscription channels! :)"
2,Bad movie...don't waste your time.,"Bad plot. Bad acting. Stereotypical, one-dimensional characters. Cliche, trite, boring... Stupid idea, stupid to the core. I watched it for $2.99. I want my money back."
4,"Pretty good flick, Guy Pearce is funny","Although it's not as good as the last Die Hard movie, this is, in my opinion, better than ""Escape from New York"". I really liked Guy Pearce. I found him to be a lot more amusing than Kurt Russell's character - Snake Plissken. Definitely more sardonic. The only issue people might have is the number of F-bombs in this UNRATED version of the film.Make no mistake, this is a ""B-movie"" filled with scary-violent secondary characters, a witty, sarcastic leading man, a hang-over written plot and not-so-great CGI, but it's still better than a lot of B grade space movies in recent years and even some A grade space movies.My ""Minecraft"" guru, slightly geeky, 14-year-old nephew said he liked it a lot, so definitely a winner with teen boys.In the end, it is a bit of a fun time out for your brain.Enjoy!"
3,Luc Besson... voila ... action!,"If you like Luc Besson's B movie, french fried action, then by all means get the ketchup. I found it moderately entertaining mostly due to Guy Pierce walking through a role for a paycheck. You'll still be hungry a half hour after this snack. Okay popcorn fun for a $4.00 dollar rental."
2,Surprised Guy took this role,"This a a typical hollywood action/sci-fi film, nothing special. I'm surprised Guy Pierce took this role. I always see him in very good or great movies.This is the same old good guy vs. bad guy scientifically illiterate clap trap. I'm sorry I paid to see this, and extra for high def."
2,Left a lot to be desired,This was a low budget badly written movie. I'm surpised an actor like Guy Pearce signed on to it.The only reason I bought it was because I'm studying Italian and this movie has a Italian language audio and subtitles.
2,Stupid.,"It tries to have the wit and action of something like Die Hard, but it falls completely short. Gratuitous violence for violence sake, and many attempts to be stupid funny followed by serious right after. Spend your money on Die Hard or Lethal Weapon instead."
2,It was action,"But that is about all. I was disappointed in it and hoped it would be better. If you like a tough guy type roll, this may interest you."
4,B-Movie Fun: Leave Your Artistic Snootiness Behind,"Lockout is the type of movie that you need to go into expecting nothing from, because the unexpected humor, zippy dialogue, rapid-fire action scenes, and cast of quirky characters is about as entertaining as it gets. Even my stodgy spouse enjoyed this movie and laughed aloud at times. There are some plot holes and a few maguffins that will leave you scratching your head and wondering why events happened and why characters acted the way they did, but who cares? Have some fun with this romp and let your hair down. It's an entertaining 1:50 of movie mayhem and fun.This movie is part Escape From New York, part Die Hard, part Star Wars, and part Mad Max. It's a blast!"
4,Better than expected,"I had heard such terrible things about this movie that i went into it expecting the worst. However, i actually liked it. I can understand the criticism, because it feels like you fall into a movie already in progress, leaving you to guess a lot about plot holes. But sometimes it's not a bad thing when a movie dispenses with the dull introductions and pushes us down the roller coaster. Overall, a nice bit of escapism, with some good one liners."
3,Lockout,I just saw the movie for me I have mix feelings. The actors were good but the plot was weak. The other thing I did not care for was how many times they used fowl language. Beside these things I just said the movie was alright.
4,"Not great ,yet I keep watching",The plot was typical but I keep watching it over & overt.Predictable is an understatement and a lot of bad acting but I keep watching it
3,Escape from NY in space.,"Movie was decent and fun, but nothing new or groundbreaking. I enjoyed watching it, but don't really need to own it."
3,"Ok Action, Ok Si-Fi","Nice but not spectacular special effects, mix with an average action story with a little si-fi thrown in for good measure."
3,Lockout,"Basically, it was just ok. I thought it might be midiorce and I would be deleting it, unfinished, but it was just ok enough to watch; only fast forwarded through a little bit of it."
3,Not Bad...,"Good action movie, but there seems to be something missing. It's worth watching while cleaning up the loving room or organizing the kitchen."
2,QUICK REVIEW,"Lots of action not much substance. Was kind of lame in its subject matter. If you want ction with no thinking, then this will do."
2,Kids will like it...,"Good movie if you are a 12 year old. Otherwise don`t spend your time and money. The story is old as world. Single hero saving the planet. And scenario is so shallow, it`s almost insulting."
1,Very poor movie,"The movie is boring, and nothing exiting. It was a waste of time.The actors need more acting training. The script is very simple."
2,Pearce good...,"movie bad. Throw logic and common sense, science and fact out the window. Sometimes a movie can get away with it, not here. Where are you, Snake, when we need you?"
1,Don't waste your time or money on this film!.....it is aweful!,"I knew there would be action and adventure in this film, but I didn't expect such terrible writing and lousy acting! The film moves quickly and has lots of stupid one liners. Even the action or fight scenes leave you wondering.... ""why they did that"", or ""why didn't they do something better"" with that scene. Overall, one star was generous for such a poorly directed, poorly written and poorly acted film!"
4,it was good,"I really never heard of this movie, but it is a type I watch. So I bought it and was pleasantly surprised."
3,It'll kill some time.,"I saw the previews and was pretty psyched to see this. I'm a big fan of Flixster and watch the reviews before I watch a movie. This one didn't get much praise so I didn't go see it in the theater. I've like Guy Pearce since The Time Machine, I never really saw him as an action hero but he really surprised me with this movie. It's totally mostly predictable but there are very few movies that aren't these days, if you like action and don't mind the lack of originality, I'd say give it a chance.The wife wasn't interested and I know her well enough to say she would have fallen asleep."
3,Great,Great show..Great sh ow..Great show..Great show..Great sh ow..Great sh ow..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great sh ow..Great show..Great show..Gre at show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..
3,The B Plan,"I expected an interesting Scifi movie, and got an action packed and funny B Movie. Entertaining. Suspend your disbelief, sit back, enjoy."
3,Did anyone else run across this problem,"I tried 2 PC's and 2 consoles and the disk had no Subtitles. There are about 6 languages listed but none work. There are also no closed captions which, unlike Subtitles, were not advertised."
4,Fast Action,Fast Action and Entertaining---Not as good as BattleShip or Hunger GamesStory line could have been better with some romance thrown in.
2,lockout,the story was just dumb....I like science fiction but also have somje common sense..... the economic cost of putting a prison i9n space is just to much....
3,"Pretty Good, But...",This movie is a good waste of a few hours. The problem is that there is nothing original - you feel like you have seen this movie several times in the past in various incarnations.
3,dumb fun,Reminds me of the old 80's stupid and over the top action movies. Guy Pierce is enjoying himself by the looks of it. Shut your brain off and enjoy. Good one liners and some decent action. CGI is bad in the beginning.
1,Unsatisfied,"The case that it came in was black and blank, I am not satisfied with the cover that I received."
1,bleh!,"Terrible movie. The idea is interesting and would make for a great action film, but it was obviously produced on a low budget. The movie is thrown together. The story is not given time to develop and the film jumps around. Not worth your time."
1,Complete waste of time and money.,Shallow story matched perfectly by inept acting and directing without as much as a hint of an original thought. It keeps amazing me how these type of scripts continue to be made into movies.
1,So bad,"What a terrible movie. It starts out well, but I think that's all they had to go on. No reasons for what happens on the space station. The end is rushed and makes no sense unless suddenly everyone is psychic. Sigh. Don't waste your money. Why are those space ships flying around and around in front of robot guns??!! I want my money back."
1,L ockout,Honnestly one of the first very boring unfocused mmovies in a long timeI wouldt recommend this to eny. One looking for a good film two thumbs down
1,bad.... just bad.,I should have know that this movie was going to be so bad. Action was terrible. Story was terrible. Only good actors were the bad brothers. Guy Pierce seemed like he was doing a bad impersonation of Mark Wahlberg.
2,"I'm not sad I watched it, but never again.","Okay, so I knew going into it that this was not going to be an Oscar contender. The premise is interesting (if familiar), but I like Guy Pearce and I like space movies. The trailers seemed kind of funny, and it was on sale, so I figured I'd take the chance. Unfortunately, by the time I got halfway through the movie, I wanted Maggie Grace's character to die. She is one of the most awful characters I've seen in a film in a long time. It was like she didn't want to be saved and valued her hair more than her life. I loathe this character, and she ruined the movie for me. If you like whiny, ridiculous, and illogical female leads, this movie is for you."
2,Only if you are really bored.,This movie is very similar to the made for Scyfy Channel movies. It just does not work. I slept through much of it. The movie is shot in constant motion style and gave me a headache. The action is so chaotic that I gave up trying to follow it.
1,bad movie,"This is a terrible movie about a space prison. Guy Pierce is annoying in it, and the other actors just don't pull anything off. However, it's hard to blame them because the directing is downright juvenile. I expect better from a Luc Besson production, but given the past few movies he's been apart of, I don't know why."
5,Das was sehr gute!! = KICK ASS,"PEIRCE DUDE REMINDED ME OF HIS CHARACTER IN ""MEMENTO"" ANOTHER KICK ASS MOVIE.. HE DOES THE NON CHALANTE SACRCASM TO A TEE AND HAD ME CRACKING UP AND THE GIRL MAGGIE FROM ANOTHER GREAT EUROCORP MOVIE ""TAKEN"" WITH LIAM NEILSON SOOOOO SWEEEET. QUICK FUNNY ONE LINERS AND GOOD ACTION AND TURNS OUT HE HAS SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH JOHNNY CASH'S BOY NAME BOY NAMED SUE :) DEFINETLEY WORTH THE TIME IF YOU LIKE TO LAUGH AND ACTION."
3,underimpressive,I am a SCI FI fan and as such I give 3 stars. It is hard to find good quality movies these days.
2,Kind of B movie,"Or better a kind of a B Computerized Movie.Claustrophobic because the location is a space base ...no more claustrophobic: is a space cryogenic prison (and not too much to spend on sets).Not as 'positively' claustrophobic like in Alien to be clear.My expectations weren't high and this is below that.A movie to watch in a boring sunday afternoon, nothing more epic then this."
4,awesome movie,"Great movie. Very entertaining. Great mixture of action, horror, sexual tension, and comedy. My favorite kind of movie. I bought it so I could watch it again."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Rented this on a whim after viewing the trailer. Well worth the price! Lots of action, suspense, and humour. Definitely recommend this one!"
2,"Good idea, bad movie","This movie was a good idea, unfortunately the script was poorly written, the directing wasn't good at all, and some of the special effects weren't even given any attention.It's not worth owning, and after seeing the movie I wasn't that thrilled with having paid $3.99 for it."
2,Was OK,"For some mindless entertainment, this movie fits the bill. Feels like a SyFi channel original. As for a cheap rental, also fits the bill"
2,so so,pretty cheesy movie dumb in alot of ways. Although it was mildly entertaining for the price. wouldn't highly recommend but if you've got nothing better to do not a complete waste of time.
2,Poor,"Poor directing, poor acting and predictable story line. The computer graphics were the only thing ""good"" about this movie and even that was just...okay."
2,Not particularly memorable,"Don't remember much of the movie as we were drinking heavily while watching it on the deck. You had to suspend reality right up front as the President's daughter would have been brutalized immediately in a prison take over situation, space station or not. Kind of labored after that."
2,Predictable,"Nothing to see here that hasn't been done elsewhere before. Bland. Other movies have done the same thing better, most notably 'Escape from New York'."
2,Had potential,"*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*This movie had quite a bit of potential...but just didn't work. The concept was quite different. But was looking for a more out of the box execution. Like finding the only possible way into a place that suppose to not be broken into(which they didn't do he just strolled on board). They shouldn't have killed all the hostages. I would have settled for snow and the girl going out of their way to get them out. And Mase!!!????...there was no need...that story line made now sense?? Maybe if they had better presented what he was doing it might have made more sense. They had at least three different story line 1.) Snow & the girl 2.) Snow & mase 3.) and a briefcase that was suppose to tie it all together. And it just didn't work. Wasn't the worst movie, but i wouldn't have gone to see it in theaters. This one is a miss."
5,Great choice,"Do not judge this movie off ""reviews"" that you read from others. Judge it off your own experience. As all movies should be. Give it a chance. I typically laugh when other people talk ""shit"" on a movie that they themselves do not like. This is not like any action movie. A guy (Guy Pierce) must save the pres. daughter from a prison in space that all dirt bags got loose on and now the prison is falling out of space.... epic. epic story line in deed."
4,Good movie.,"I enjoyed this movie. It contained action and adventure. It was also futuristic, and yet, had a sense of realism to it."
4,unexpected,I did not see any advertisements of this movie in the cinema's so when i was going through the Amazon catalog and saw the preview it peaked my interest. This movie had some great action scene's going for it and it had some good suspense moments going on i would recommend this movie.
1,Paralyzed by stupidity,"This movie is awful in every way. There really isn't anything good about it except it is set in space and space is cool. Beyond that the acting, dialog, CGI, storyline, characters, and everything else with this movie is absolutely terrible. I have no idea how I was able to watch it all the way through except for some weird deer-in-headlights situation. Also Guy Pearce's constant one-liners were atrocious and forced."
1,LockOut,"Poor script.I want to add poor acting; however I do not feel that Guy Pearce, Vincent Regan nor Maggie Grace had a good script or direction.This is my first movie review. I am only reviewing it because it was so bad.A complete waste of time.Poor me for purchasing."
1,Save Your Time,Please take this as a warning that unless you want to waste time out of your life that you will never get back do not watch this movie. I cannot even begin to highlight all that is wrong with this movies because I might actually reach the character limit allowed by Amazon. It was just that bad but I watched it for everyone else to save them the time that I wasted. There is nothing good about this movie.
1,Oh please give me a break will ya what dufuss movie,Bad Bad and a sinker too. Poor acting and stupid plots and another bomb for the box office. This moive been done before and actors would tell them do not give up your day job. The goofy guy should have been blow away right form the get go and bad guys were a bunch of walking and talking stiffs. Buy it if you want but do not pay over $5.00 for it.
1,Utterly pathetic--DO NOT WATCH,"The story completely lacks plausibility; simply put--they take liberties that invalidate the basic premise so the rest of the action is baseless/meaningless/pointless. I love many flicks that others rebview poorly purely for the entertainment value, visual effects, acting, drama, horror, scifi, supernatural, etc. but this was absolute garbage from 5 minutes in. If I could give it zero stars, I would have! Anyone involved in its production (or at least those that made the decisions) should be ashamed..."
1,Waste of $3,"F&$% you Hollywood, F&%@ you.Please stop making bad movies.I can only suspend reality so much, unless it's a cartoon."
3,Fun movie,It's not bad. Plot jumps around a little. Don't expect Academy Award material. Good special effects. Decent ending that keeps you guessing.
3,Not what I had expected.,"Dazzling special effects, mediocre acting, predictable plot -- what's not to like? I didn't expect very much more than a mindless distraction and that's what I got. I don't think anyone will be taking any awards for this production, but it was mildly entertaining."
2,Lockout,"This moviw as many others look good in the trailer but was a disappointment in full length, I wound not recommend this to anyone this movie lacked a good story line good acting and any really good action scenes."
2,Love Guy Pearce but not this movie,"Guy Pearce tries his best to elevate this movie beyond its mediocre script, but no one else seems to care. The result is a high concept movie with bland execution and it just isn't fun."
3,Not received,I have not received this item yet.....LOCKOUT....So I cannot review it yet! Ordered it in July and nothing yet in mail
4,SOME GUY NAMED SNOW,"LOCKOUT gets its entertainment value from its pure adrenaline rush and its visceral attack on the viewers senses. Fluidly directed by Luc Besson (TAKEN, FIFTH ELEMENT), the film's basically simplistic plot is inconsistent and filled with holes and unexplained information which I won't discuss here due to spoilers.Guy Pearce swaggers his way through his role as Snow, tossing off one-liners like dandruff, and is actually quite good. TAKEN and LOST's Maggie Grace is coy and sassy as the President's endangered daughter. The crazed prisoners are stereotypes and Peter Stormare is his usual nasty self.LOCKOUT isn't classic cinema, but as action fare goes, it fills the bill."
4,"GOOD MOVIE, GOOD ENTERTAINMENT","MY BROTHER IN LAW IS THE WARDEN, I HAD TO BUY IT. MARK TANKERSLEY DID A GREAT JOB.HE HAS BEEN WORKING FOR THIS A LONG TIME."
2,Cliche!,"Everything about this movie is cliche.2 dimensional characters, laughable security at a supermax facility and predictable story line.Do yourself a favor and skip this."
5,Escape part deux,"I read a few of the negative reviews and I had to weigh in. This is a fun ""no brainer"" action flick. Basically ""Escape from NY/LA"" in space. Cool sets and both leads hold their own. It is nice to see Maggie Grace get to stretch a bit after 2 Taken movies. So pop up some corn and sit back and just enjoy the ride!"
3,Different,"I'm not sure how much sense this movie makes - OK forget the sense it's kinda fun. No way, anything like it could happen but ... The interrogation is a little rough and senseless and the star takes a heavy beating showing little signs of damage and the story line jumps around and the bad guys are really bad and crazy and you windup in space..... See It."
4,Fun action movie,"This was a fun action movie. Not the best script, but still fun to watch. I would rnt it again."
3,Pretty good but could've been better,"I was looking forward to the release of this movie and I enjoyed watching it. I was disappointed with the ending, however and I think it couldn've been much better. The rest of the movie was pretty good though."
5,great fun!!!,"this was just a fun movie to watch from beggining to end. it is as it was said to be a 'bladerunner' and 'taken' put together in one film. luc besson the great director of 'leon aka the proffessional' does a great futuristic fun filled movie that doesnt let up. pierce is just fun to watch as a guy who must rescue the presidents daughter from a prison full of murderrers in space. if your a fan of scifi, this movie is a must see."
2,Bad writing and too many one liners,"Not worth the time or money.Writing was poor, story line predictable.Reminded me of a bad horror film from the 80's."
2,????,"WHAT A WASTE OF FILM. I'VE SEEN BETTER ACTING AT A THIRD GRADE CHRISTMAS PLAY. HOW CRAP LIKE THIS GETS PRODUCED, I'LL NEVER KNOW. TYPICAL HOLLYWOOD TRASH. MAKE 'EM QUICK. FORGET THE QUALITY..."
2,"The amazing Guy Pearce, wasted on this","As a fan of sci-fi, action, space, Luc Besson and a bunch of other elements, I was hoping that the mediocre reviews of this movie were a bit out of whack. Disappointingly not so - Guy Pearce is just perfect in this role, and the writing of his character is excellent, but it does nothing to save this poor effort of a movie.This isn't really a 'leave your brain at the door' experience, it's just a ridiculous story with moment after moment that is just beyond implausible. Even accepting the silly premise, you still have things in most scenes that make you roll your eyes - the screenwriting uses the most basic devices and almost everything is a leap of faith which stretches way too far very early on. And then there's Maggie Grace, playing a helpless daughter that needs to be rescued... really?Honestly, not worth it, even if you love sci-fi and action and don't mind silly fun."
