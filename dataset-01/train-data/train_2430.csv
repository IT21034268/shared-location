2,Doesn't Provide Answer Key,"This is a great resource, however its value is limited because there is no answer key for the workbook. The publisher says that the only way to get the answers is to spend $104.95 on the instructors CD. This really should be stated up front before people buy this book and learn the hard way."
2,poor edit skills,"This book has some huge errors. The writting in this text seems as if a differant person wrote every paragraph. As an instructor, this is very frustrating. I've had many a student request the chance to string the writer up by the neck. For example, it asks to discribe a van body but has no discription of it in the book. Trust me, I've looked. It also displays insulated and petro tankers, and then proceeds to label them incorrectly. I beleive, either the writter is a little slow in the head, or the editor needs to find a new job. The first addition of this text had errors too, but the second edition only got worse. To bad for me, I haven't yet found another text book that covers this information to the degree needed in a classroom setting. Maybe next time the editor will be awake while he/she is working."
3,She's no Liz Fraser.,"It's pretty good, but it doesn't compare with any of Robin Guthrie's Cocteau Twins material. It doesn't take you to any of the places that Liz Fraser's vocal meanderings can. I recommend seeking out Fraser's side projects instead of purchasing this -- unless you're a die-hard Robin Guthrie fan (then buy it). You can find great information at [. . .] & that includes the list of non-C.T. works."
2,Africa is NOT a big village,"I bought this book for my 4 year old son who is part African in order to, facilitate his learning about his roots. In general, the book is OK but, what is not true to form is the portrayal of most of sub Saharan Africa as a village. All the stories are about poor kids in villages with mud huts! From the book, one would assume yes, Africa is not a continent but, just a series of villages with no electricity nor running water; perpetuating yet another myth about Africa.It would have been good to also read about the bustling city of Douala where kids rush to catch the school bus or, loud Nairobi with the matatus that take the school kids on field trips. I have not found a book like this yet so, a project in our home is to create one like this for our son."
4,Great Book,"As the other reviews have said already, this book is colorful and engaging. It's a great book for mid-late elementary kids to learn about the diversity of the African continent ... but in a story-telling format interesting for kids. I own this book myself for my own children, and also bought a copy for my daughter's elementary school library."
5,A True Legend,"Si no has escuchado este disco estas quedado. Creo que es uno de los mejores de Tono y es un ejemplo de su capacidad natural para producir musica de calidad. El merengue es suave, alegre, golpeito etc. realmente una compilacion de todo y para rematar canta una cumbia muy rica al final. Mis favoritas son: Ella Fue, La Nena del Tongoneo, Brujeria, Te Nombro Reina y Un Dia a la Semana. Pero facilmente uno puede escuchar todo el cd sin parar. Tono que sigas acabando."
5,Nyroc's Beggining,This was a great book and i was very glad i read it. this book was a real page-turner and i would realy reccomend it.The book was at its best when NyrocA.Statred his 'Quest'B.Nyroc beggan seeing scroomsAnd C. When Nyroc learned about his 'Special' Ceremony.I was at the edge of my seat through the whole book!This book is for the people out there who just wish to 'fly away' from their busy life.(if you are busy that is!)this is also for fans of Soren and Gylfie.(and Digger and Twilight!)this was a great book!
4,"Good, but what happened to the old Ga'Hoole?!","This book's pretty good, like the other books in the Ga'Hoole series. The stories have a new main character, Nyroc, the son of Kludd and Nyra. Nyroc is destined to become the new leader of the Pure Ones, but his own strange gift, called the fire sight, reveals to him that the Pure Ones, and his mother, are just as evil as in previous books. He and his friend Phillip (remember Dustytuft from The Burning?) must choose to stay with the Pure Ones, or risk everything and leave.The only bad things about this book are that it is a little duller than the other Ga'Hoole books, and, most importantly, there's hardly anything about Soren and the band! There's only a brief little thing about Otulissa, but you never find out what Soren and the gang are doing now! I missed hearing about the Ga'Hoole Tree, and I hope it's included in the next book, The Outcast."
3,"good, but what happened to the band?","I like this book alot, but I really miss the band and especially Soren. Soren was the character that I knew from the beginning and now he's gone but we don't know what happened to him or where he went. I hope he comes back in the next book."
3,OK,The Hatchling is about the son of Nyra and Kludd. He's not very good at being evil so he flies away with his friend Phillip. It's much better than the last few books except they weren't very good. But still they were good enough to keep me reading so i guess i have to give Lasky some credit.
5,Excellent!!!!,"This book is not like the ordinary book you read every day.It is about Nyra and Klud's son, Nyroc. He goes through every ceremony a regular chick would, but one extra called T.U.P.S.I. Nyra is determined to turn Nyroc to be even more vicous than his father. The thing is, Nyroc doesn't have an evil soul and heart like the pure ones. Later, a rouge smith comes to burn Klud's remains, and to tell Nyroc about T.U.P.S.I.....other wise known as the cute murder...Will Nyroc fulfill his destiny or run away to be forever haunted by his father's scroom?"
3,not the best of the series,its good but not the best in the guardians series. soren was a better character then nyroc. nyroc was pretty good though.
5,A spiritual classic. . .,". . .for all time.Whether you are Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant, Thomas a Kempis' timeless classic is for you! This book can only deepen the spiritual life of the Christian, especially the Christian who wishes to draw closer to God through Jesus Christ. The author, not only by his writing, but as evidenced by his life, really tried to ""practice what he preached"" and implement in his own spiritual development the very useful and practical advice he offers to others.This book is not to be missed. (It is intriguing, is it not, that this wonderful Catholic classic is so well edited by a Baptist minister? The very existence of this particular edition is testimony to the universal appeal of this volume.)"
2,"No chapter, very cheap DVD","I was very dissapointed in this DVD.I purchased the Stamina reformer and needed DVDs to go with it.- There's no chapter and a long introduction. I normally start the DVD before I get dressed and get the performer ready. When I'm ready, I still have to fast-forward to find the beginning of the work-out. For $29.99, I expected an interactive DVD, at least some chapters!- the exercises are virtually the same that came with the free DVD included with the Performer I purchased! (Level 1), so if you already have Level 1, you are wasting $29.99- the DVD is short, I expected more variations and more exercises.- the teacher is good but nothing spectacular. I was hoping for more explanation of what each exercise did for my body.Bottom line: if you already have other Stamina Pilates DVDs, same your money."
4,Good workout!,"Although it seemed at first that this workout was for the lower-body, the exercises near the end are more focused on the upper-body. I like how the narrator is not the person performing the exercises. There were only a few exercises that I had trouble keeping up with, however that gives me something to work towards. Overall, if you already have a preformer/reformer machine then this dvd is perfect! I had fun following along."
2,Not crazy about this exercise tape,I wanted an exercise program for my Pilates reformer. The Stamina tape has way too much stuff at the beginning. I found it really a pain to try and fast forward to get to the exercises. Would not recommend this tape.
4,I really like this book,"I Like this book for its Simple.it is easy to make the projects ,not real expensive to get the materials or one probably already has them on hand..and one can incorperate the projects or parts of them in any of jewerly/beading/or polymer clay pieces..I wouldnt recommend this book for a real Intermediate or advanced jewerly maker..its for people like myself..or my daugther who are new to this craft and want to have some trendy pieces to wear and or sell...it has more ideas to me than patterns ill follow step by step,And most important the pics are wonderful....Mrs.C"
1,CD does not respect Chavela's artistic spirit- don't buy it!,"This recording is absolutely disgraceful. I think someone decided to mix Chavela Vargas' authentic voice with some syrupy, sappy guitars and vocals by god-knows-who. It has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the austere and pure artistry that is Chavela Vargas' voice. As such the recording is a distortion, a lie, a violation of the artistic spirit and wonder that is the voice of one of Latin America's greatest singers. I don't believe Chavela Vargas has authorized this recording. It is artistically bankrupt and morally corrupt."
1,This is not Chavela,"The unique style of this great singer has not been exploded in this recording, which is very poor. The album concept is a reunion of Chavela with the Rondalla del Amor de Saltillo, which never occured. She has never sang with them, and she dislikes this recording the most. A fan of hers should not even listen to this album."
2,Image advantage,This is not the essence of Chavela Vargas. She has not recorded this album with Rondalla del Amor. Old recordings have been mixed with new recordings of this rondalla and the result is not quite right. Chavela's voice does not need any other instrument but the guitars. The rondalla causes a big noise and I'm sure Chavel herself dislike this CD very mych.
1,Pirate recording,We should also note that Chavela was not paid for this record and that it was made without her authorization. It is a disservice to the greatest singer of Spanish America.
4,Very good storage,"I ordered this for my 2011 Polaros Ranger Crew and it provides easy to access and necessary storage. I use the main padded compratment to store most of our iphones, cells and my wallet. The next compartments we use for some small flashlights and tires gauges, keys, and some small stuff. The end compartments are not very useful but I was able to find use for it to store a two way radio for emergencies. Overall I really like it!One thing I do not like is that it hangs down a bit too much blocking part of my rear view, but I am looking to see if I can mount it flush to the ceiling to reduce the reduced view in my rearview mirror.One other thing I would like to see improved is to have a little larger comparments, and waterproof compartments so we can keep everything in it when we pressure wash my vehcile."
5,a beautiful book,"This is a marvellous book. The tons of beer and the (supposed) grossness are just smoke in the eyes: this novel is about a clean-as-a-clean-sheet love. Mr Ridgway, I really hope to read about you and your books soon."
2,Not a 100%satisfied,"I received the product and followed the instructions to the last detail. I used a black light to locate the urine stains,treated them with the product, put plastic over the saturated carpet for 12 hours to allow the product to absorb and activate, allowed the carpet to dry and retreated it. The smell initially worsened which I read online is normal, it is an indication that the product should be working, well it has been 4 weeks since I have completed the treatment and the smell is still lingering."
4,It Works,I bought Urine off 1 week ago. I have a dog who constantly peed on the coffe table and have 3 stains on the carpet from this. One was so bad I didnot think anything could get it out. It was so bad that when I walked out of the bed room in the morning the smell hit you in the face. I have used this product and most of the stain is gone. The smell is almost gone. I have had to treat it 5-6 times because the stain was so old but it works. I think you have to keep doing it until the stain is completely gone. I know it says 1-2 times but it takes more then that on the old tough stains. I am a believer.
4,This product really works,"Doesn't always remove the discoloration, but odors are eliminated, which is a big problem with multiple dogs when one has an ""oops"". And the product's smell is not offensive like other products I've used in the past. The best product I've found so far and I've tried many of them."
2,Budget MTB,"This CD is a cheap way to get the Marshall Tucker band's 2 biggest hits,""Can't You See"" & ""Heard It In A Love Song"". I'm not familiar with other MTB tunes, but they sure have a lot of albums available. There are no liner notes, so I don't know where the other 8 tracks of this CD came from, but they sound like they are from the early 80's & are very wimpy after hearing the 2 big hits. I also wonder why this album is named after the least interesting song on this collection. I guess I should have gotten a more expensive MTB album if I wanted to hear more great 70's southern rock worthy of being on the same disc with ""Can't You See"" & ""Heard It In A Love Song""."
2,More of a peep than a scream,"I have to admit to being rather ambivalent about Jill Churchill's books at this point (this is the fifth I've read). They're definitely light and fluffy, but perhaps a bit too fluffy. And there is the irony that the main character, Jane, is supposed to be a ""grammar buff"", but the book itself had a few obvious grammatical mistakes (I should have written them down at the time, I can't remember them now!). The story was... okay... the writing was... okay. Nothing special, nothing awful - it's one of those books that if you read a few hundred books a year, it's worth giving a quick read. But if you read less than that, or if it's going to take you more than a day to read it, I wouldn't bother. There are far better mystery novels out there."
1,I used to love the Jane Jeffry books,"and would look forward eagerly to every new one. The lastest two, however, have been dire. In 'A Midsummer Night's Scream' the plot was banal and the characters two-dimensional. What was Elizabeth for? And Tazz? They served no purpose at all, as far as I could see. Why do Ms Churchill's characters all refer to each other as 'Mrs So-and-so', even after they've been acquainted for some time? It's needlessly old fashioned and grates on me more and more with each new book.My major nitpick, however, is for the gushing comment from the new literary agent Jane has found regarding Jane's grammar. ""This is she"" is correct but unbelievably stilted in this day and age. Later in the book, however, Jane told another character ""You did good."" Execrable."
2,"Wow, this was a lousy book","I second most of the feelings expressed by the people before me who didn't like this book. I've read everything else in this series and this is undoubtedly the weakest of all. The characters are so uninteresting, and the action is unrealistically laid out. I was so bored by it I ended up skimming most of it and then just giving up and reading the last chapter to see how it ended (not that I cared much by that point). And, sheesh, are Mel and Jane ever going to get anywhere in their relationship? I don't understand the two of them at all--we never hear much about their attraction or anything.) A VERY disappointing book. I doubt I'll continue to read the series from here."
3,Enjoyable series entry,Another fun and interesting visit with Jane and friends. And I'd like to remind some readers that not all mysteries are about murders.
2,Characters in a bad amateur play,"I ordered ""A Midsummer Night's Scream"" in spite of all the reviews saying it didn't live up to the previous books. The Jane Jeffry books have always been great...until now. What happened? This one seems to have been written ""by-the-numbers."" None of the characters, even the ones I know and love, conveyed any feeling. It's as if they're all cardboard--performing in a bad amateur play. I went back to re-read an earlier title (""War and Peas"") and found all my favorite characters interesting and engaging. Trust me, pass on this one. Nothing happens."
1,The first and LAST book I'll read by Jill Churchill,"I love mysteries. I picked this book up at the library (thank goodness because I would NOT have paid for this). This is the worst mystery book I've ever read. The murder doesn't happen until way later in the book. The premise of taking needlepoint classes had me yawning. The dialouge didn't seem like real people would speak that way. Also, usually the least suspected person ends up being the murderer, but not in this case. It actually points out a potential suspect and then that suspect is in fact the murderer. There is no surprise element to this book. I would not recommend it."
2,Series going downhill,"I used to love the Jane Jeffry series, but the last two installments were really disappointing. I'm certain if that was her first manuscript, Jill Churchill would never be a published author. The mystery takes backseat to needle point instructions, the characters are lifeless and the dialog forced. Someone listening to Jane and Shelley's conversations would never in a million years guess those two are best friends. The biggest disappointment is the lack of the laugh-out-loud humor which was so endearing in the earlier books in the series. A real shame..."
5,Great transfer to DVD,Everyone has a opinion about whose the best Holmes and Watson team. Because they are clear and also understand what they are saying. The timing for each team to appear on screen is key. I have watched each teams of Holmes and Watson and by far my opinion is these two. I have all their Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson team of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce is my best team.
1,SHERLOCK HOLMES DVD SET,"THE SHERLOCK HOLMES COLORIZED VERSION/ ALSO BLACK AND WHITE I received this set of suposedly colored versions and re-mastered dvd,s on april 19,2012. The set I received was a public domain set in black and white only. The clarity of the dvd,s is terrible. I contacted amazon twice in the past week and am still waiting for a response. This is the first bad experience I have had with AMAZON."
5,Excelent conveter with good compatibility,"I was looking for a converter for my CH Flight Pro which used an old DB-15 plug, and well is no longer used anymore.I saw this, and was a little pricey bot ordered it and it works great.It converted the joystick to USB and Vista detected it and installed drivers and was up and running in no time.It has a switch on it to configure for four different joysticks makers and different axis and such.It has a good build quality and over has a clean look and doesnt look cheap.One thing though, older games will not detect it because they were not made to detect USB joy sticks, games like F22 Rapter and those games.It should work fine in Flight Sim games though."
4,A Good Adapter but doesn't work completly for me,"I pushed the adapter so that i could hook up my Saitek Flight yoke and rudder peddles, but I haven't found a setting were I get full functionality from the system. the rudder peddles work but not the toe brakes, and only 2 of the buttons on the yoke work."
5,CD - Radiant Awakening,"I LOVE this CD!! First of all, I ordered it on a Friday and received it Monday afternoon from across the country - I don't know how it got to me so fast! Mostly, what I love, though, is that the music is just so gorgeous and peaceful. The other day I listened to it on my Ipod while I gardened, and it was the most heavenly part of my day. I would encourage anybody who loves beautiful, meditative music to buy this CD. I wish I could find many others just like it."
4,Nice Debut Great First Song,"One way to make a rememberable entrance in a salsa arena is a to release a memorable first song. He accomplished this with ""Inolvidable"" a song originally performed by Laura Pausini. Without a doubt the first and third songs are great."
5,wow!!if you like marc anthony..you'll love frankie negron,"for a first time effort,frankie delivers an exceptional salsa album. he has a beautiful voice and the songs are written well.."
1,Don't bother,"I hoped this would be awesome for getting animal hair out of my rugs, similar to how I can do that with the wire dog brush, but it doesn't work anywhere near as well. It mostly just combs the hairs that remain woven into the rugs. Don't waste your money."
4,Great concept. Minor flaw in design.,"This is a great invention for pet owners. It works well, but the angle at which the handle is mounted causes the rake head to 'jump' as it is scraped across the carpet. To avoid this, you must tilt the rake up at an angle that utilizes only about 20% of the rake head's surface. It is, however, a handy tool for quick pick-ups."
3,"Good, but could be so much better.","While the rake does what it's supposed to, it's only about 40% efficient.If the head was convex in shape, it would eliminate the ""hopping"" across the carpet and anyone could use it at any angle.If the rod had a pin or set screw to keep it from unscrewing, it would not unscrew itself.If the handle had a grip or even a foam cushion part it would feel better in the hand.For a $30 item, all of these issues should have been addressed before it was sold to the public. We are still debating if we want to send it back. In a way it feels like driving a 1970's car. It gets the job done, but in a very crude manner. Could have been so much better."
4,a large slicker brush on a stick,"I purchased this rake because my (expensive) vacuum cleaner bags were filling up with dog fur in the blink of an eye. This rake will pick up the fur fairly efficiently. It is essentially a dog brush of extended length, specifically a slicker brush, with a pole attached. The wires of the brush will not penetrate a pile carpet, but slide along the surface grabbing onto the fur. The only frustrating part is that the rake seems to jump or hop as you pull it on the carpet, rather than smoothly sliding. Adjusting the angle at which you hold the rake against the carpet seems to be the solution (although this solution may decrease the efficiency of the rake - don't know). I have yet to master the technique. The pole screws onto the brush, and mysteriously unscrews as you use it. But as long as you remember to twist it tight every few strokes, it doesn't fall off and isn't a problem. I would recommend this product."
3,It is not what I expected. I will be returning it.,I think that since I don't have any pets it is the wrong product for me. I want something that will brighten up my carpet wear pattern throughout my condo. I think for the right home it would be a good fit.
3,works great,this product does what It claims to do However it is very labor intensive as the handle is way to short & you have to bend over to adequately rake up pooch hairs which is backbreaking!
4,This rake was ok!!,The brush needs to be larger and not keep coming from the handles when using it. It needs cleaning instructions.
5,OMG...,"I had NO IDEA how much pet fur can get stuck deep down in your carpet until I bought this thing. I vacuum, occasionally get the carpets professionally cleaned... I thought my carpet was probably not too bad, but I have two pets and an older carpet so I figured it wouldn't hurt to try it. Boy was it an eye opener! I highly recommend this rug rake. I don't have pet allergies, but I do believe this has also cut down on dander in my bedroom."
3,Not what I expected but it gave me another good idea,"Basically this is a big slicker brush or wire brush. I needed something to clean the pet hair off carpeted stairs. This doesn't work because it is too wide. It is cumbersome and doesn't get into the corners or close enough to the edges. But it does work on mats and on low pile rugs. After seeing this, I bought a slicker brush and a wire brush which are both more effective on stairs (altho they did sprain my wrist). The other thing that I don't like about the Universal Rug Rake is that it's hard to get the pet hair out of the the wires.For large areas, this Rake will work best, small areas get a wire brush from Menards $1.99 or use your pets slicker. I'm using a hair pick to remove the hairs caught in the wires."
5,What a time and back saver!,"Love it, love it, love it! I have two border collies who drop hair constantly. Now instead of bending to pick up the handful of hair I use the rake. Yes as some others have stated it will skip over the carpet at times. But by adjusting your angle that is corrected. A longer handle would help. Wow the amount of hair that is picked up is amazing! Friends have commented on how good my carpet looks. Wish it had a comb to clean out the leftover hair in the rake. Will buy another when this one is worn out."
4,"Good idea, could use a different design","I used this to pick up misc. hair and fuzz on my carpet. I like the Rug Rake, but it did tend to ""jump"" across the carpet as other reviewers have noted. I was pleasantly surprised at how much hair and fuzz it did pick up but because of the design I had to go over the areas several times in different directions to ensure that I did not miss spots. Overall, it worked just fine and I am pleased with the purchase."
2,Stressful,Yes this works. The only thing is every three sweeps and you have to screw the brush back on. It keeps screwing off so after doing one small area you'll be too aggravated to keep going.
3,"5 Cats, 2 Dogs","Works great at getting pet hair off the rugs and carpet, but the angle of the rake relative to the handle is not quite right and makes it a little difficult to get a good raking rhythm going. I find going in arcs instead of a straight motion best. If it weren't for this I'd give it 5 stars."
5,Amazing tool at a great price.,"Easy and when used properly does a great job of your hair removal. Complaints about the handle being week are misleading as when used with a light touch it works well. It is NOT necessary to work the tool hard as it functions just as well with a lighter hand. It is simple to use and can really remove the pet hair from the carpet or rug very effectively and with little elbow grease. This is far different than the rubber wonders all over the net, as this one really works and easily does the work for you."
1,Just Like Lizzie,"These episodes that the book is based on are really good. I enjoyed them very much, but the book? Well, it was okay. But it was so short, it should have been meant for a five year old. But if you're in love with Lizzie or Hilary as much as I am, I say read it, because it did follow the episodes very well, and I liked having two of my favourite episode in one. So I say, read it for yourself, but if you're not that big of a fan of the show, then skip it."
5,Shakespeare and Arden!!,"This is an exemplary edition; beautifully presented and impressively researched. The text is clear, and the notes are models of learning, common sense, and clarity. The introduction, though lengthy, is a remarkable essay in itself, demonstrating exactly why this play has fascinated audiences and readers for 400 years. All serious students of Shakespeare will want this on their shelves."
1,Rips on first wash,Vinyl ripped on first wash for me even though I followed the directions for washing. Very disappointed. Now I have to go buy another one and I will not purchase from this company again.
3,It's ok.... :-/,"My baby has only recently started sleeping in her crib more because we co-slept for the vast majority of her infancy, but now that she's a toddler she spends more time in it at night. I've only used this twice for extended periods of time, so I'll base my review off of those two experiences:pros: -It dampens the plastic crinkly sound from the mattress and gives it a pillow top feel...like a ""big girl"" mattress, while protecting her mattress from her random overnight leaks.cons: -It didn't really fit her mattress good, which can pose a serious suffocation risk to a smaller baby, even when covering it with a normal crib sheet. I took a chance with it because my baby (outside of her birth weight) has always been oversized. I bought some 50 cent ironing board fasteners to make it fit tightly around her mattress and it stays put.My overall recommendation is to shop around and look at different mattress protectors. You might like this one or you might not, just know your options."
2,Lasted 3 months,"At first I was very pleased with this product. But I just pulled it out of the dryer and the entire backing is torn apart. My washer/dryer has never ruined anything, so I'm guessing it's cheaply made (as other reviews noted). Now I need to buy another- such a hassle!!"
1,Cheap plastic backing,"I like the top of the mattress pad, but the vinyl backing is very cheap. The first time that I washed and dried this cover the plastic tore. I now have holes all over the back of the mattress pad. Don't waste your money."
1,Do not put these in your dryer!,"I followed the drying instructions on the label, on the lowest heat setting. They are ruined now with holes and heat damage (even though the mattress pad was not hot AT ALL when I took it out of the dryer). If you purchase (and I wouldn't) these I would strongly suggest air drying. Very disappointed."
1,Chinese Baby Company's scratchy mattress pad,"Was surprised that this product was made in China. I own two Sealy Stain Protection Crib Mattress Pads which are soft and made in the USA. I thought I'd try these out, since I need two more for my twins cribs. Unzipped the package on these and they are scratchy. But they're going back now, inferior product and made in China, won't work for me."
1,Very disappointed,"I did a lot of research before placing this order and am very disappointed. Based on the good reviews and good price, I ordered two of these for the twins I'm expecting shortly. The box arrived today and I already know that this is going back. The quality of the fabric feels like something you'd purchase in a bargain bin of some yucky discount store. I guess you get what you pay for - I'm going to learn a lesson and pay more for better fabric in the future."
3,Soft mattress pad,"I ordered this American Baby Co waterproof fitted quilted crib pad to ""waterproof"" my 3 yr olds bed. He has a big boy bed, with a crib size mattress, and this pad fits well so far. However, I have washed it several times, and it seems like it will probably shrink pretty quickly with frequent washings. Also, I don't know yet if it works, because he hasn't wet his bed yet. I'm pleased because it doesn't have that vinyl smell after washing and feels soft and padded. However, I still prefer the Priva brand ""Snoozy waterproof cotton knit mattress pad"" but it's unavailable at Amazon, and I can't find it elsewhere (I wish I had ordered more!)"
3,it fits,"made in china,,trying to get away from that should not be called american baby. ok should not be allowed to call american baby"
4,Durable!,"I have used this for over a year and it works great and has held up well. It must be dried on delicate (which I am fairly certain the directions tell you that) because I used medium heat and a small section melted a bit.All in all, a very good purchase!"
3,"some are good, some are bad",I can agree with every review here.... I own 4 of these. I have started to notice that one (I think only 1) has been tight; meaning when I take it from the dryer that I have to pull it for it to lay flat. I figured out that the inner waterproof layer has completely torn/melted. I usually put my dryer on low for my girls' items so I don't know what happened. I really really like these pads but I guess you have to be extra careful to not put it in the dryer on anything but extra low. (I assume that is how it got damaged).
4,Best mattress pad so far,"We have used other mattress pads in the past where the plastic eventually shredded in the dryer. This pad has held up great, through many wash/dry cycles. Very pleased with the fit and durability. Purchased another one after throwing the others away!"
5,"Good quality, easy care","I bought this to fit my Colgate baby mattress. It washes and dries well, and keeps its shape. Easy to get on the mattress, nice and thick to keep our baby comfortable."
4,Durable and comfy.,"I've had my mythos for several years now, and although I'm not a super active climber, I do go out regularly. The mythos have held up really well! the leather is starting to peal back just slightly, but that's to be expected at their age. They're super comfortable and I've used them for everything from bouldering to sport and crack climbs. Overall I think they're a great shoe. The only downside is that you have to lace them, but that still isn't all bad, since you can get them to form better to your foot that way"
5,Deuter,"Very relaxing to listen to. Deuter is one of my favorite composers. Being a licensed massage therapist, I use his CDs for my clients."
2,Avoid at all costs,"Two stars may be too generous for this printer. First of all, EVERY time I used the printer I had to begin by performing the cartridge cleaning routine to avoid horizontal streaks. Oftne this took at least 2 tries and used up far more ink that I was using on my print job. And even worse, I happened to not use the printer for about a week when the black cartridge was about 1/3 full and the color was about 3/4 full. When I tried, the black was clogged beyond salvage. Hate to hammer it home on the brand, but I had a similar problem with a Lexmark a few years ago. I have definitely purchased my last Lexmark.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because when it worked, the quality was decent. So, if you print A LOT, and a lot of pages at once, it may not be so bad. But if you are an occasional printer (and by occasional I mean a few times a week even.) you will waste money on ink cartridges."
1,Worst printer ever!,"For starters, the first time I went to print something on the printer I couldn't get the black to work it was straeky and faint. I called tech support and talked to someone from another country and he walked me thru a few steps and it actually made it worse! He said he would send me a new toner cartridge, but who wants to wait? I think I will be returning the ""piece"" to target and buying the HP I had originally set out to buy! What a waste of my time! Not to mention if the window is open, look out it might blow away! This looks as cheap as it works!"
1,you get what you pay for,"I bought this thinking it would be ok for the simple tasks I needed it to do: printing notes, directions, etc. I knew the color quality wouldn't be all that great. I ended up needing to buy black and white cartridges constantly, and the part that feeds the blank paper into the printer stopped working entirely after only a few months. I wish I had spent a little more to get something that actually works."
3,"Good taste, but it's just too thin","This nacho cheese sauce is pretty good on taste, especially compared to a number of other canned sauces I've tried. However, it's just too thin. It's the consistency of soup and doesn't hold to the chip well enough. You'll be dripping cheese everywhere if you're not careful."
3,Get MORE Than You Pay For,"Star Office IS a viable alternative to the more traditional (and much more expensive) MS Office. Both the word processor and spreadsheet program were easy to get started and had help systems that got me going with my existing Office 97 documents with no problems. I liked the ""appearance"" settings that enable you to set the look and feel of the program to either a Macintosh, Windows or UNIX Motif type of user interface, and this feature worked flawlessly on both the Windows, UNIX and Linux platforms I tested on. I moved the Star Office format and Office 97 format documents I created between platforms without problem. Star Office would easily a four star product except for the fact that it wants to become your desktop, presenting its view of the system rather that the one the OS presents to you. I found that rather annoying and consider it to be one of the few true negatives in a program that otherwise shines, especially given the price."
1,HELP!,"I am not a dummy, but I think that I need StarOffice 5.2 for Dummies also. As one of the others has stated. I have had nothing but problems getting this thing installed and finally gave up! It is just a big mess! And now I cannot get it to completely uninstall and it is causing a lot of complications with my system? I cannot understand what is going on here. I have tried everything! It seems it isn't installed completely, so I can't actually use it, but I can't uninstall anything more than I already have and my systems still says it is there and it is reaking havoc on my system! I am glad to see that there a few other people out there that seems to be having the same problem that I have. I thought I was losing my mind for a while there.ARGH!"
5,Long Live Competition,Great decision.Excellent sneaky way to build up something against customer's kidnapping from microsoft. Suite needs better and more promotion. I look forward to buy it or download it asap. It would be great to have in spanish for my people at the company.
1,Too broken on Windoze,"Here are just a few of the limitations:* Unable to support SSL mail. * Unable to support SSL news. * Easily exploitable with Java holes. * Blue Screen of Death showed up way too often. * Broke other software on installation such as WinCVS. * Had several runaway processes. * Errors in setting up mail required re-installation for repair. * File format matching is ""ok"", but it is missint too much that I use in MS Office.On Linux, it runs much better, but the limitations with respect to encryption and Java still apply.I would like to break away from Microsoft, but Star Office is not the solution I would like to use."
4,Not bad for an inexpensive office suite,"I've used Star Office on a Mandrake 7.0 Linux platform and I've found it to be nearly as good as Microsoft Office 2000. It doens't have as many features or as much integration, but then again, most people don't use even 10% of the features in MS Office. Word Document compatability is a plus, but some characters such as quotation marks got lost in the conversion process. Hopefully Sun will fix this in the next release. Star Office also runs a bit sluggishly compared to its MS cousin, but it is by no means painfully slow. For Linux users, Star Office is a MUST HAVE."
3,Better off waiting for 6.0,"I have been using StarOffice for the last year or so. It is a powerful office suite, that may not be perfect, but gets the job done. StarOffice is probably the best non-MS office suite available. It has many of the features you'll need (make presentations, slides, edit/format text files), plus it has the best doc filters available in a non MS Office product,and is easy to use. The only downside is it's slow and a memory hog. If your using Linux, this is the way to go. Yet, if you're on a system supported by MS, your better off getting MS Office. Or at least waiting till StarOffice 6.0 comes out. 5.2 is a great choice for your everyday needs, but it still doesn't compare to the king."
5,StarOffice 5.2 rocks!,"StarOffice 5.2 is a great, affordable alternative to other office suite offerings. It's easy to use, has all the power the others have, and the price is fantastic! You can easily save your StarOffice documents as Microsoft files and StarOffice opens Microsoft documents as well. I love being able to instantly move from application to application without feeling like I'm moving to a different world or wait for a minute before they launch! All the applications are integrated into a single desktop that I can customize and tweak to my needs. StarOffice 5.2 has a new fan in me!"
5,Great Microsoft Office substitute,"I have been using it for almost a year, and I really love its simplicity and power. It is a wonderful substitute to the expensive Microsoft Office."
1,Slow and Cumbersome,"I was frankly disappointed with the performance of this product. It runs slow and the many small icons are hard to remember without constantly using the help. The graph capability for the spreadsheet program is limited compared to that in Microsoft Excel. Although it is cheaper than the Microsoft office software, you get what you pay for."
1,You get what you pay for,"Star Office isn't bad if you are looking for a simple Office suite with watered down features and very little support. With Star Office, you are on your own. Sun touts Star Office as a strong competitor to Microsoft Office. Hardly. Use this product for yourself if you like but remember, Star Office is free. Based on this, how much time do you think Sun will put into supporting, troubleshooting and enhancing this product? Also, given Sun's track record with how bugs are addressed in it's server side products, there isn't much hope regarding resolving issues in this product. Lastly, Sun is a hardware company. They have never been strong in software development and, with the introduction of Star Office, they maintain that track record.If you want serious integration in your Office Suite, Microsoft Office is still the top choice. Remember, you get what you pay for."
1,"I can not get instolled , so it is no good to me","if the CD I receved is to install it is not working, Ihave tryed what the book tells and it still does not wok,pleas e-mail me and let me know how to get the office 52 installed,"
2,What to say?,"Well I know a lot of people who have Star Office on their computer. They either still end-up buying Microsoft Office or uninstalling Star Office it self. But the price it-self is astounding. This product is for people who are doing essential things such as writing letter, and short documents. Most of the persons I talked have said that its little bit difficult use but you kind of eventually get the hang of it. But I'm really not into that, I would put that [money] aside and save put it towards saving for Microsoft Office or Works Suite which offers a lot of software for just [money]. But if you are using some other operating system apart from Windows such Linux, go for it because Microsoft won't be making any Office XP for this any time soon. Put it this way, Linux people buy it, Windows people it's optional."
5,More than MS Office,"This office productivity suite was reccomended to me by a friend who claimed that it was the ""most versatile and adaptable office suite he had seen"". I was doubtful at first but am convinced and the best part is that it is free for distribution to all your computer junkie friends as well as download from the Sun site. I purchased it only due to the fact that it includes the users manual and aprt from that who can argue with the price. Compared to the MS Office gold edition which is far more expensive it is a steal."
5,Far more than just an office suite.,"StarOffice 5.2 has most all the office component capabilities one needs; spreadsheet, word processor, database, draw program, visual basic and macros, etc. However, with OpenOffice.org developer support, this core ""office suite"" is only a starting point for many possible applications. Applications interfaces such as ""point of sale"" or ""scientific instrumentation"" can be built on this office component core. StarOffice 5.2 is, in effect, a visual component library that works on many operating system and hardware platforms. This puts StarOffice in a class by itself."
3,Star Office Comments,"Basically an excellent program but with some irritating faults. The help menu is fragmented and unco-ordinated and it does have difficulty opening some MS documents. The biggest fault, I find, is that with labels it truncates the right hand row so that only half the labels are usable without a lot of adjusting. You can look in Page Preview for a label and all is correct but on printing all the right hand lettering is missing, also it sometimes insists on printing registration marks in the middle of the label, seemingly at random. Otherwise, excellent incorporation of spreadsheets into documents and very easy to use with excellent HTML editing."
2,Maybe I should buy Dummies for StarOffice,"I read the reviews, loved the price, and bought it. I don't like it. I guess I should stick with Unca' Bill.I used Netscape for 3 years before going to Microsoft IE. I did not have half the hard time switching gears with those two.I deleted StarOffice from my desktop, but changed my mind and wanted to reinstall it. It kept telling me I had the application already loaded and running.Well, du-uh to me...maybe I am getting too old to switch gears again. Hey, I can use FTP, write HTML, and work critical care without difficulty, so who's the problem child here?nora"
4,"Good, but try the free download version first","There isn't much in here that isn't in the download version, fonts and clipart I guess... I have both, got the full version as a gift, and didn't notice much diffrence."
4,Sun StarOffice 5.2,"I haven't had much experience with non Microsoft office products, but Star Office is a very good product. It is easy to use, not as easy as Microsoft stuff, but there are additional features that can be uesful, like swaping data with different operating systems. Hey, if Microsoft is messed up for a few years, try this out!"
5,Star Word Processor,I LIke star better than microsoft premium 2000. It does not have microsoft outlook taking charge of your computer. Aubrey Faucett
5,A excellent descriptive guide to toy making in wood.,"30 Toy Vehicles of Wood is an EXCELLENT book. I have been making wooden toys for many years and I find this book a MUST for any toymakers library. The book is written for the novice woodworker, but even an expert craftsman can find some good techniques in this book. The drawing are clear and the instructions are easy to follow. The materials list for each toy is handy so just the right amount of wood can be bought. Ronald Tarjany has chosen a good cross section of toys for this book. With this book you will be making a wonderful wooden toy vehicle in no time. Buy this book. You will be well rewarded and enjoy hours of constructive entertainment during your leisure time."

2,Lacking,"Let me first say I really like Zenworks and have since 1.0. What I don't like is a large book that just covers the basics as found in the help files. I was looking to this book to cover, in depth, details about Imaging and the Middle Tier server. While there are details covering Imaging, I don't see any additional information above and beyond the on-line documentation and the help files. As far as the Middle Tier server - don't bother. The authors didn't. There is a section on installing the server telling the user how to fill in the DNS name and such but no real substance. And that's it! There is NO section on how to use the Middle Tier services or why one would want to. All in all, if you want a book for your shelf, buy this one. If you want a book you can use - keep looking."
2,Prostate cancer kills more men every year than Vietnam,"This book failed to mention that no side effect from prostate surgery is as bad as any side effect of prostate cancer that has metastasized. The book did not emphasize how important it is to consider removing the prostate when the PSA level starts to climb, even when a biopsy does not find (misses) cancer cells. The ""watchful waiting"" approach so popular with HMO's should be exposed for what it is: the ""watchful killing"" approach. This book does not discuss the horrible side effects of advanced prostate cancer enough to allow men to make a truly informed decision. Doctors like to say, ""Men don't die of prostate cancer; something else usually kills them first."" Anyone with an I.Q. can figure out that this is exactly the same thing as saying ""If something else doesn't kill you first, prostate cancer will."" Please don't let your loved ones suffer through the process of watching prostate cancer kill you."
3,Prostrate,This book is generaly well written and easy to read. It was published in 1997 some of the information on BPH is becoming dated.
2,The Prostate: A Guide for Men and the Women who love them.,"This is a older publication (1995) in serious need of updating. I would not recommend buying this book for information regarding the latest testing, diagnostic tools and treatment options."
3,Have to agree it's getting dated,"I took a very close look at this book while undergoing testing to determine if my high PSA reading at my last physical was due to cancer or not. While I find the author's other book ""Dr. Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer"" which is in it's second edition among the best books out there I noted that some of the material in this book is getting dated and for somone to use this book as their primary source of information on the subject of prostate disorders would be denying themselves of a lot of information vital to making a wise decision. If a new revised edition of this book were to be relased I have no doubt that it could be a very good reference. If you are looking for up to date information to help guide you through some possibly difficult decisions save your money and look at other titles."
5,Invaluable companion for foreign travellers in Japan,"This book is the perfect pocket-size companion for foreigners living or travelling in Japan. The book is small and lightweight, so can be taken anywhere. Despite its size, the content is more comprehensive than most larger size dictionaries and the Japanese is written both in Kanji/hiragana (useful for showing to Japanese people) and Romaji. There are clearly presented usage examples and key words are explained in more detail. The detail of this book makes it useful to anyone studying Japanese from beginner to advanced level."
4,"lacking some words, but overall good.","This book seems to be missing a lot of words. There have been several times I have tried to look a word up and have not found it listed. Most likely, it has just the most commonly used words. If this is all you need, this is a good dictionary to buy. If you want a reference of a large vocabulary, go for another."
2,useless to me...,"I found out how useless this dictionary is to me when I tried to look up a Japanese word. Then it hit me that this dictionary is ONLY English to Japanese, versa is NOT included. It's best to get one that's both ways; unless you're the only one speaking lol."
5,Two Months Of Hell Recorded,"This is one of the most devastating memoirs to come out of WWII. Condensed into the period of April to June 1945 the diary records the plight of the citizens of Berlin during the Russian advance and occupation. It truly captures the atmosphere of chaos and the means of survival and coping of the citizens with particular emphasis on the women who were left at the mercy of the conquering troops. While the first impressions are the horrors and ravages of war visited on the citizens,as I read on I was amazed at the at how quickly the author adapted herself to her new surroundings and how quickly the city began to emerge from it's nightmare and attempted to return to some degree of structured normal life.Apparently it was not well received when first published because people were not disposed to feel sympathy for the Germans so soon after the Nazi era. It clearly belongs on the shelf of any student of WWII alongside Hiroshima and The Diary Of Anne Frank."
4,The civilians always seem to pay the real price of defeat,"This diary, written by a Berlin woman in her 30's during the fall of Berlin illustrates clearly and forcefully the real meaning of defeat. Interesting asides on the nature of the Russian conquerors: raised in a society where they received but could not choose they had little concept of ""value"", even of booty. Most of all it reveals the common-place nature & acceptance of rape or of attaching oneself to an Ivan lover - for protection and survival. A very human diary of survival in year zero.Forewords of the English edition are very helpful before starting."
3,The best from Malevolent Creation since their first,"As some giant innovation to the genre, this album doesn't rank, but for a fast death metal album that never lets go of the throat this is excellent. The sturdy but battering mid-paced Florida metal of the first album is now fast metal with shrieking chants and creative arrangements of simple recombinant parts. Riffwriting is alert and opportunistically simple as always. For those who want fire in their speakers."
3,"good knives, but overpriced","i was looking for forged steak knives and i was attracted to the style of these knives. the walnut handle is a nice classic touch. for the price, i was hoping they would be better balanced, as the handle is noticeably heavier than the blade. also, i was hoping for a sturdier blade, as it's slightly flimsy, though it isn't an issue with cutting. additionally, i was hoping the knives wouldn't have been made in china! my parents purchased the same style (not outset) of forged steak knives from the christmas tree shoppe (discount/bargain retailer) and they are better balanced with a sturdier blade, and they cost much less.i would give these 5 stars for style alone, but they lost a couple of stars for overall quality and the overly high price point."
4,Steak knives,"Excellent value for the price! I bought these as a present for my daughter. - they are attractive, feel good in the hand and cut well!"
3,good for what it is but not like its new gameplay,"first thing i have to say is this game is not the pc version or xbox so on.this is a new game whith an rpg like tone.this game combines elements of rpgs and survival horror games such as resident evil. such as combining items.and shooting aimlessly.the game also feature an up above view and three charactersthat have there part.jack black heals and jack shoots and combines items while the girls heals.withch all makes a very strategic experience.so bassicly as people1.shoot2.solve puzzles ex: find rope and wood to make raftthe people part of the game is done well but nothing newbut the diiffrence between this and other games is the kong breaksimplicity can sometime sgive a game a whole lot more replay value withch is were kong comes in smash,hit pull, and a miracle to gba kong lovers.every so often you get to play as kong witch is a great repeptitive breakit makes this game a little more plesurable and is done well."
4,Fun Book,"We got this book as a freebie from the USO. It has been fun to read to my three year old. He loves guessing the name of the ""mommy"". The only reason I give this book a four is that the book seems to end very abruptly. Seems like they need a rap up page. I will probably look into the other books in this series!"
5,Don Knotts movies,Arrived in no time at all in very good condition. Don Knotts is still as funny as when i was a kid. good family movie.Sit back relax with a bowl of popcorn and enjoy some good laughs.
3,SPACE HICK,"Attendant at childrens amusement park gets job at NASA: JANITOR. Lets family and townsfolk believe hes been tapped for spaceman training. After embarassing kin who come to visit, he gets himself locked in shuttle and must perform those experiments, then return to Earth like real spaceman. Becomes local hero. Rather sickening. Here and there stupidly funny (that is if you're alone, and no one knows you're watching!)."
1,Not for Kids,"I got this with the intent of getting a clean funny movie we could watch as a family. Don Knotts goes on a drinking binge, there's more than one scene w/drinking and smoking, and most of the humor is based on the audience concuring that Knotts' character is unintelligent and unworthy of basic respect. Even w/out the child-viewing consideration factor it's more of a one-time rental than anything worth owning."
1,False Advertisement from Creative Labs,"I totally understand what the previous reviewer said about this DVD player not running on Win2K machines. I purchased a similar Creative Labs PC-DVD (it was the Ovation 12X) and it said ON THE BOX that it runs on Win2K machines.Bottom line..... they are wrong. It's not worth waiting for them to come out with an update because by then, a better DVD player will come out. This will be the last item I ever purchase from Creative Labs."
2,Great Product But Very Poor Support,"I purchased this drive in December of 2000. Since the software did not work with my Windows 2000 operating system, I downloaded the beta driver for the DXR3 board. It work somewhat fine, but it caused several problems with other drivers on my system. Uninstalling the driver's did not work and after two weeks and a dozen phone calls to Creative Labs, I finally just reinstalled Windows from scratch. The drive works fine now, but the DXR3 board is sitting on the shelf and hasn't been used since. After nine months, there's still no support for Windows 2000 and I feel like I've been ripped off... Creative Labs has had more then enough time to come up with something for Windows 2000 users. The included software is decent, but I found other programs that are much better. I'd give it 5 stars if the drivers were usable."
1,Terrible If You Have Windows 2000,"Although I got a great deal by using coupon codes ..., I am sorry to say that it works terribly under Windows 2000. I understand that this has been on the market for about a year, yet the drivers for Windows 2000 are still in beta. The audio skips and I am unable to use the software unless I am logged in as Administrator."
1,Don't buy this if you are using Windows 2000,"It turns out that Creative doesn't have supported Windows 2000 drivers for this product. After several hours of troubleshooting and effort getting it to work, I finally contacted Creative to see if they could be any help. They told me they don't yet support Windows 2000 (though W2K's been available now for almost a year), and that they can't help. I asked what to do next, and they said to return it to the place I purchased it.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this product..."
2,compatibility problems,"This worked fine in my old computer (AMD K6 450MHz, built-in sound/video on motherboard, Win98SE), but was horrible in my new box (AMD Athlon 900MHz, Voodoo 3 video, Win98SE). Wouldn't play DVDs using any software (PC-DVD, WinDVD, PowerDVD, Windows DVD Player). PC-DVD and WinDVD both locked up. PowerDVD decided it wouldn't play copyrighted DVDs. Windows DVD Player apparently didn't recognize the Dxr3 decoder card, because it kept saying the player wasn't properly configured and I couldn't play DVDs without a decoder. Tech support was prompt but not very helpful. I did at least a half-dozen different things they suggested and the problem was never solved. I finally replaced it (and my CD-RW, which was okay) with an LG Electronics GCC-4120B CD-RW/DVD-ROM combo drive, which came bundled with PowerDVD; the new drive has worked great."
1,(dollar amount) paperweight,"For some reason I have always thought that a Creative product was a good thing. I consider that to be dead wrong now. The box boasts Windows 2000 compatability, but thats a joke. I was able to get it to work in Win2k, after MUCH tweaking, and divine intervention I think. When I reformatted this weekend though, nothing I do will get it to work properly. Creative is notorious for releasing massive bloatware with their products, and this is no exception (although it is not as bad as their Live! products). I can't believe this thing cost (dollar amount), when a (dollar amount) generic DVD player will work better, if you have a decent processor and video card the ""extras"" don't do much at all. Stupid me for buying this, don't make that mistake. (...)"
2,Kinda Confusing!,"The introduction started out great. However, the rest of the book doesn't keep my interest. Aside from the run-on sentences, and lack of punctuation, I'm sure the author is excellent at managing property. He repeats several thoughts as if he's trying to find the words to say. I'll finish reading the book because there may be some information that I can use."
2,There are much better guides out there.,"He's a very good speaker, he does have a (biting) sense of humor, he is overly obsessed with sex (which can be funny but ultimately just gets tiring), he's a brilliant *marketer*. He is talented at handwriting traits but I would assume that his lower loops all run into the next lines every time - he has too many irons in the fire. The reader is left with the feeling that we, the book purchasers, are not worth hiring an editor, nor running Spell Check (even once??).I've invested quite a bit of money in Bart's books and courses and the quality of the materials is very sub standard. He's selling himself totally short by racing through, writing as fast as he can and never looking back. We are left with the feeling that he has somewhere else to be and doesn't really have time to write this book so would you please just go to his website(s) and buy more stuff! And hurry! :)If you actually wish to learn about handwriting analysis, find Dr. Erika Karohs online."
2,Grandchild got bored quickly,"I had purchased this as a gift for 3 1/2 year old grandchild who loves Shrek. The plastic runner would wrinkle on my hard surfaced floor. This would interfere with the direction of the roll of the ball. With the set that I received, it was hard to understand what the character was saying (only one character spoke). It would seem entertaining only for a few minutes and after retrieving the ball several times, my grandchild was quickly bored with it."
4,LIttle kids really like Shrek Bowling,"When I opened the box, I was a little disappointed because the set was smaller than I expected and I realized that Shrek was the only figure that talked. Regardless, I used it for a Fall Festival ""booth"" at our church and all the little kids LOVED IT. They got in line over and over and over. So what do I know....I guess it's a ""little kid thing""!"
3,Not too bad,"Clear, concise discussions of JKD and the techniques. A little on training. Not a bad book on the subject. (I have seen few GOOD books on the topic). Worth checking out with Paul Vunak's books and Chris Kent and Tim Tackett's efforts."
3,good condition.,bought it for my 2 year old nephew and he loved it. i read these books myself when I was his age. hopefully he gets as much joy from reading them as I did.
1,Cliffords Christmas isn't that good,We really don't like the part where Santa's toys fall in Cliffords water dish. I would not suggest this book for you.
4,We like Clifford's Christmas,We have a Bull Mastif and the kids liked comparing our helpful (and clumsy!) dog to Clifford. They especialy liked the way it ends because our family's dog is a wonderful friend who makes every day Christmas as well. :)
2,A little disappointed,I love Kliban Cat but was a bit disappointed in this particular book. Didn't have but a few of my favorite Kliban pictures
3,Cute,I had this book as a kid and I though it was super cute. Its bit dry but if you love cats you'll find some gems in here.
1,"Not a TV Soundtrack, a collection of pop songs","Don't be deceived by the description of this CD. It is not a soundtrack of all the cool sound effects and background music from the TV show, it is a compilation of popular songs that have to do with money. I bought this CD hoping it was the soundtrack to the show but I was disapointed to find out that it isn't. The songs are pretty cool to listen to anyway, but the description doesn't describe this CD accurately."
2,Better to go to the British!,"This is a compilation CD of songs that Disney probably thinks could be associated with the megahit TV show. Not bad in and of itself; the CD harkens to be a game-show version of the ESPN Jock Rock/Jams series with the soundclips of the show's highlights in between the songs.If you were expecting this CD to be the music from the show, you'll be disappointed. If you want the show's soundtrack, spend the extra dollars or pounds, and get the British version of the album, which contains virtually ALL of the elements of Millionaire on one CD.For this CD from Disney, though, I think you're better off getting these songs elsewhere."
1,are they serious?,"i guess it had to happen...someone was sure to put something like this out. while it has some good songs on it,do we really need sound effects from the show mixed in...and do we really need regis singing? alot of the songs on here are available elsewhere on better collections than this."
1,"Not worth a nickel, let alone a million.","Very disappointing. Little music from the show, and a lot of re-mixed stuff which was not very entertaining. In the upside, it was cheap, so not much money wasted."
1,What'll They Think Of Next?,"Who wants to buy a useless CD? Is there a movie or a show that does NOT have a soundtrack these days? Here is a group of artists that have absolutely nothing in common, except the subject matter. I mean, how many times do we have to hear ""Call Me"" by Blondie? And Regis sings? Uyyy....The fortunate part is that listeners will lose interest long before they get to his track. So phone a friend and tell him/her to buy the CD Rom game instead. As for the CD, my answer is ""D"" for Don't buy it.....and that's my final answer."
1,How Dare They,"this album was so horrible i threw it into the trash. i should have broken it into tiny pieces and flushed it, but i dont have that kind of time. and i definately dont have the kind of money to be wasting on albums that make me literally sick.(...)"
3,A Good but unremarkable collection,"A pleasant disc of early reggae/rock-steady. While there are no really bad tracks here, nor are there any that will make you sit up and take notice. An enjoyable listen that's worth picking up....eventually."
4,Not the worst I have seen.,"This is a good action movie, don't get confused, this is not a commercial airline with a plane full of panicked passangers, Not at all, is a small private plane with only 5 passangers, most of the trama happens on the ground, I would not said bad movie, but should not be advertised as a disaster movie."
3,Regency Romance,"Heroine turns hero down, goes to France, gets married, husband dies in a duel, comes back very rich. Includes black hearted villian, dishonest servant, less than perfect heroine's mother."
4,A really exciting writer of Regency books,"I'm cheating really because I haven't read this one, but I couldn't get in to review the ones I loved so much. My Lady Love and An Improper Duenna - two of the best regency books I've read, and I've read a lot. I also write them as Anne Herries. My Lady Love is about a wealthy countess who falls in love with the mysterious Chad, a man her servants found wandering naked on the moors, and steps down from her class to marry him. Since this is Mills & Boon there are no prizes for guessing that Chad isn't what he seems, but it's a wonderful read. In an Improper Duenna, Chloe forgets her lowly station to reach for love, risking dismissal and goodness knows what - two ends of the scale but two ladies prepared to dare all for love. Exciting stuff!"
5,great pictures!!!!!,"I own both a prior Cuddeback digital game cam as well as this No Flash Game Camera. The pictures from this newer camera are amazing. I am very happy with this purchase and will likely purchase another one soon for other sites on my property. The only issue I have found with this one is that my previous camera came with a theft prevention cable that could be used in addition to screwing it to the tree. The No Flash does not have this and I suspect it is because they want you to purchase a special box they have now to secure it in place from ""bears"". I am really only worried about thieves and vandals. Still, it will probably not prevent me from buying another camera. Also, I have had to have my old camera repaired and the cost is minimal. Very easy to work with."
5,"Spies, Black Ties, & Mango Pies","This is such a fun book; I enjoy all the stories that go with the recipes too.I haven't made these but there are some interesting recipes in this book, for example, elephant stew, dog buscuits (in case you can't just go to the store and pick some up), play dough, and others.some of the most helpful pages are the conversion tables and the ""what to use if you don't have..."" list (for example, if you don't have buttermilk you can add a measured amount of vinegar to a measured amount of milk and wala instant buttermilk substitute)...i would have never known that.i have not made all of the recipes in this book, i have my favorites....but the recipes i have made turned out fantastic....my favorites are the Hawaiian BBQ sauce and the spaghetti carbonara."
2,"Chinese-Made, Food = Lukewarm","It's true this is durable, but this Stanley food jar does not live up to the name Stanley. Don't waste your hard-earned money for this Chinese-made plastic impostor of the original Stanley quality. I have this food jar and don't even bother to use it anymore because the food gets lukewarm in a couple of hours. You can spend less or about the same on eBay and get a vintage metal U.S. made Stanley Wide Mouth Food Jar that will keep your food hot for the whole day. I did that and am so much happier. I now buy vintage American-made Thermoses and food jars. All of them keep my food and beverages hot all day and the vintage thermoses even hot over night and into the next morning!"
2,Breaks easily,"I dropped this thermos on my kitchen floor and the handle broke clean off. It can still be used, but can't be held easily. It is not very durable."
2,"Turns my computer off, even the power is on.","I bought two of these for our home computers. I installed on on my computer and it seemed to work, for a short while. Not only does it not give me time to shut off my computer, it cuts out the power even when the power is on, Waking me up several times in the middle of the night with a shrill alarm. Tested it with a lamp, per the instructions of the support dept and it does the same thing, gives no warning before the power dies out. Installed the second unit, same problem. Tech support says that I am overloading the unit. It doesn't even work properly with a lamp. Will never buy from this company again."
3,It works! Cheap insurance.,"I have come to trust APC products and this one has not dissapointed me. Our neighborhood is prone to numerous brownouts and brief power outages.....This backup has served my laptop well, providing the ""juice"" needed at all times."
3,I should have bought a higher power rated model.,"In the month since I have been using this UPS I have had 3 incidents where it has cut the power to my computer, sounded an alarm, and required a reset. The software did not provide an explanation of the cause. My best guess is that my computer simply draws more power than this UPS can handle? I think a better purchase for my needs would have been the 550 model."
2,Fire hazard,APC has several outlets but these are prone to a multi-outlet overload. My unit smoked without the 40 A fuse blowing and was traced to a faulty transistor that overheated and melted the plastic casing adjacent its heat sink. My lesson: use the highest VA unit at least 2X your maximum expected current requirement.
4,Worked for me for four years now,I have the six outlet previous model of this product. I have a home office and have plugged two models of Macs into this unit and it has worked like a charm for me. My house has pretty crappy 1950s wiring and my neighborhood has all above ground wiring and lots of trees. This leads to many power outages and I have not had any problems with surges even though my husband's computer was killed by a surge (he doesn't have an UPS). It gives me plenty of time to shut my machine down and save my work in the event of an outage.I agree that on my model the outlets are a bit too close together to allow for my giant plugs. I also agree that the alarm beep is a bit annoying.
3,Entry Level Product,"This is really the entry level, so don't expect to have long battery back up time. I have a 19inch LCD monitor and a Dell Inspiron 530 desktop plugged into this and it gives only 5 min back up time. Nevertheless, this is really for you to back up your work during a blackout, not meant for you to continue working during the blackout... But with such short battery back up time, I should have bought the one with 3x2 slots at Circuit City for $30 instead; could have saved $9.(Perhaps I commented too early, I just clicker the software recently and it indicated that I have 30 minutes standby time... which far longer than what I previously said... Hence my giving it a four stars rating instead of three... - Jan 2008)"
2,Not what I thought,"Be careful, although this UPS has 8 connectors, only 4 is backed up by the battery, the 4 other is only surge protected. I didn't read the fine print, just saw the ""8 outlets"" writing.Also, even though there's plenty of room on the UPS, the outlets are lumbed together so I cannot fit multiple adapters. There's just no excuse for putting them so tightly together. It's annoying and stupid."
3,RECEIVED USED/REPACKAGED/REFURBISHED???,"This UPS was purchased to replace a dying UPS that I have had for many years. I was not aware that this was a used/refurbished item. There was no reference to this in the Amazon listing. The UPS I received was obviously not new. The actual battery was scratched, the box had been resealed and there was a list taped to the side showing results of QC testing. The 3 stars does not reflect on the quality of the UPS, only the condition as received.I hooked it up anyway, and was glad I did. The very next night, we had an hour-long power outage and the UPS worked perfectly."
1,Make sure it is enough for your system,"Before you even consider the BE350R see it in person at a store or go to the APC website and run their selector application to see what size UPS you need. There is a chart on the box that shows battery minutes for different types of systems. If you have a Mac mini and a 15"" LCD you might get 27 minutes, but if you have a tower PC and 17"" CRT monitor you can expect -- minutes. Honest, that is what is says on the box! This model is not a valid UPS for most home PCS. Hard to understand the number of glowing recomendations for this product on this site..."
5,PC Back-up,Back-up is fine. Seems to be working OK. Received shipment in very short time. Very happy.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased an APC BE350R Back UPS unit from from Tech for Less because it was the lowest price for the unit.I received the unit several weeks later and found that it was not a new unit,but a refurbished one. To make a long story short, the unit did not work and I had to contact Customer Service for Tech. They were very courteous and since they had no other units in stock,I was given a full refund on my credit card."
3,Average,I don't have a lot of runtime on this product so we'll see how durable it is as time goes on. It seems fairly simple and well built for the money except for where the plugs plug in. These don't seem to be as tight as they should be and I am concerned about this being an issue later on. I gave this three stars because there is nothing exceptional about this product.
1,This item is on 6-to-8 week backo order!,"The product is probably good. I give it 1-star due to Amazon's incorrectly displayed ""In Stock"" notice. I ordered this item on Monday, August 4 with 2-day delivery. When it didn't arrive by Friday, August 8, I checked my order and it wasn't due to ship until the 1st or 2nd week of Septemeber! That's hardly what I would call ""in stock""! My son needed this item for college. I was livid."
4,Pretty good - bad button design,"The only gripe I have is that the power button is easy to have accidentally pressed and doing so interrupts power to everything, including that which is plugged into the ""battery backup"". Both my 18 month old, my cat and myself have tripped it. I think I need to hide the unit better. I haven't had a power outage since it arrived and haven't tripped the breaker to see if it works, but it came with a nice handwritten QA slip, so I am confident that it works. The included ""auto-shutdown"" software wasn't written for linux, so I haven't used that feature."
1,Great until it stops working,"I've owned 2 of these now, but won't be buying any more. The battery only lasted a few months in the first one, making it useless as a UPS and just a very expensive way to plug several devices into one electrical outlet. The second one (another brand-new unit) didn't fare much better. Unless you are willing to buy a new unit every 6-12 months I'd avoid this one.The manufacturer wants more for a replacement battery than the whole unit cost, so that's not a good option."
4,Propane adapter.,This is a difficult to find adapter and it really is pricy. I like to use one tank and my tree with the lantern on top so in order to hook up something like my fire-pit which hooks directly to the tank I can now attach this adapter to my extension then to the propane fire-pit hose.
4,Over-priced but worth it,"Like a previous reviewer I bought this adapter so that I could run several appliances from a single propane tank while camping. If you need two ACME (or POL) outlets, you either have to buy one of these adapters or a second propane tank. Personally, I'd rather haul a small, 8 ounce adapter rather than a large, 25 pound second tank of propane."
1,Get a spare propane tank,"I hooked this up and discovered it made a strange noise, but very little gas got into the grill. Fortunately, this was the dry run and I did not ruin any good food. The Mr. Heater ""stay a while"" adapter is a better idea, along with a spare 20 Lb tank."
1,WAY overpriced.,I can buy a brand new 20# propane tank for the cost of this little adapter. Seller is out of their mind.
3,a good church history supplement,"I've had to buy several of these charts books for my classes. This one seems to be a bit more helpful and lot less biased than the ones I've had on other topics.There are definitely theological leanings evident, but that is admitted up front and most stuff is dealt with even-handedly. Also, we're talking two thousand years of history--there is bound to be some selectivity going on. I feel Mr. Walton does a darn good job here.Let's face it, Charts do not make for riveting reading. This book will be useful as a supplement to anyone wanting to study Church History (I'm sure glad I have it). The key word is ""supplement."" Don't try and read this by itself unless you're trying to cure insomnia."
4,Great suppliment to Church History study,"This workbook is a wonderful aid to the student of church history. Putting the major movements of the development of the Christian church into chart form, this book will give you a ready reference to put people and important church situations in chronological context. Most charts include brief statements of appropriate theology or doctrine, allowing the student to quickly glance at the movement of the church. I'd highly recommend this as a resource to anyone interested in church history."
2,Needed newer edition,"The product was in good shape as was described. It is just an edition that has been improved or changed if it is to be used for the class I am taking. The assignments do not jive with the chart numbers in the new edition. Not Amazon's fault. I bought used, but now I found out the new edition is what I should have purchased."
3,The Voice vs The Beat,"This was my first CD by this remarkable woman. Not since Nancy Ames & Vikki Carr have I been so taken with a voice. I was not disappointed with the singing but with the material involved here.The problem becomes obvious when you listen to the two best tracks; ""Llego El Amour"" and ""Que Bailen Los Ninos"". On these two cuts the vocalist is showcased, as it should be. The songs allow her to shine, complimenting the music. Listening to the rest of the cd, I was overwhelmed by the frantic pace and similarity of each cut. Horns/Trumpets blared, track after track and after a few songs they all sounded like the cut before. What this album needs is perhaps a new producer to put some originality into each song and let the artist take center stage."
3,"The 3,000-year-old Guide to Parenting by Wes Haystead (Paperback)","Description from the book back cover:This is not the latest advice on parenting. You'll find the Bible's timeless wisdom in The 3,000-Year-Old Guide To Parenting.

Don't experiment on your children with new advice. Base your parenting directly on the Bible, with the 3,000-year-old Guide to Parenting by Wes Haystead."
2,Misogynistic book by misanthropic author,"There is not a single truly positive male character. The men are vile, and my feeling was they could have only been created by a woman who wanted all men castrated. In fact, the author does that in the book.The professor, who is the most vile of all, must be Baudino with balls. She apparently took her opinion of men and transposed it into her charachter's opinion of women.I remember loving this book (and all the other Gael Baudino books) decades ago. I remember Gossamer Axe being wonderful, and the Strands of Starlight books being wonderful. But I also thought I remembered this as being wonderful, so maybe I should not read the other books again. Not that I can find them easily or inexpensively.I am disappointed by this book. I wouldn't say don't read it or don't get it, though. YMMV."
4,A story that sticks with you for years,"I read this years ago and kept trying to remember the name of the title and finally googled ""Brothcock"" and The Camerons popped up. It's a beautifully told story of a clan of miners where the mother is obsessed with advancing her family and herself. It's a classic and is well worth the read."
3,Get what you pay for.,"I was happy to find this book in print again, but took the cheap way out on buying used, and the book fell apart before I could read it again."
3,"Technical errors ARE there; good music, though","I have to agree with the other reviewer--you CAN hear noises on the recording, but you have to have the music turned up a little bit louder than I'd normally play it. For normal listening, though, it is tolerable at a lower volume.The piano is flawless,and the music is well done, however. Just don't turn it up too high."
3,Beethoven & Billy Joel - Response to Andy Alabama,"Hi Andy,Also noticed the similarity between This Night and Pathetique. Of course, if you read the liner notes to ""An Innocent Man"" by Billy Joel, you'll see he gives full credit to Ludwig Von Beethoven. Joel grew up playing classical piano..."
4,the kid who became presedent,"Justen Moon is a kid who became presedent at the start he rejects it then takes it. (And you will have to read the rest).this book is good, but not great, but i do in curage people to read this book."
5,Hilarious,"Dan Gutman does an excellent job making this book both funny and emotional. I read it at least 20 times. Judson Moon is funny, as is Lane, his friend. READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Disrespectful language,"In reading this book aloud with my son I was alarmed at the statement that the reason the kid ran for president was because the ""Democratic candidate was an idiot and the Republican was a jerk""...books like this are the reason we are having to teach the ""Character Counts"" and pillars of character in school ...it's not okay to call anyone names. While it may engage kids to want to read the further it's not what I want my son reading. We returned the book."
2,Good BUT BAD,They are nice tweeters......for the price but both of myn blew within a month cant handle power what so ever :/
2,not bad for the price. can't handle power,"bought these tweeters to install in my jetta along side my 6.5"" 3 way infinity speakers. at low volume sure sound great but once you try to up the volume at all they just start to crackle and sound like crap. thought hey maybe a bad batch. i bought two sets so i swapped them out with 2 new ones. same thing. can't handle any power through them and they are rated at 200 watts. even with a high pass filter installed bass cranked all the way down and an extra capacitor installed inline same thing can't handle it. if you want to a buy a speaker and don't plan on cranking it go for it otherwise save your money."
3,help,how would i go about installing these would i just tie them into my door speakers. it is my first time with them
4,"Just to be clear, this is NOT the original group","so adjust your expectations accordingly. The harmonies are enjoyable but, for me, they don't carry the same punch as the original group."
4,Dated but the spirit is true as ever,"I've always been a sucker and admirer of great marketing and this book unveils why some brands are so effective. The wisdom that drips from the pages of this book is amazing even though some of the examples and companies didn't pan out as the book predicted. The spirit of great and effective marketing is demonstrated in page after page in this short lesson but anyone who is in business (and who isn't?) could benefit from reading it. In summary, to invest your time in this 150 page book is one of the wisest things you could do."
5,This performance takes you completely,"This performance beats all other performances available. True emotions, true character. The Royal concertgebouw orchestra plays with a true heart, inspired throughout by it's conducter. A performance which should lead to feelings of delight with each lover of this music."
2,Don't recommend this,"This smock doesn't stay together when my child bends, the velcro comes apart. I will end up either donating it to the school or giving it away, very disappointing."
3,"Great beginner smock, but...","It's durable, it's got a handy pocket, and it's cute. BUT it's also small. The sizes run small, so if you think you're going to get a small size, get one bigger and roll up the sleeves; otherwise it won't protect the back, and paint or clay or peanut butter or whatever will get all over the back of your kiddo."
5,Easy to clean,"This smock gets the job done! Just wipe it clean when you are done. the front pocket catches drips and any other ""uh, ohs""."

1,"Honey, they shrunk the Warmers!","I'd used Grabbers Warmers Med/Lg foot warmer inserts for several years -- they fit my shoe (women's 8-1/2 medium width) nicely and performed as expected.The latest pairs I ordered, however, are narrower and not as long.Original inserts were flesh-colored on side facing the foot; now they're white. Also, original package had the ""Open Here"" slit on the top of the package; ""new and unimproved"" ones open from the left side near the top.Due to the reduced size: (1) Warmth doesn't seem as satisfying, even in the initial hours of use; and (2) Inserts slip around in the shoe, even though it's snug-fitting.I won't buy the Grabbers Warmers brand shoe inserts again. In fact, I came to Amazon today to look for alternatives."
1,Did not get warm,"I purchased 4 pairs of these Grabber foot warmers. I used a pair of these in my snow ski boots and my toes were still cold. Removed after 1 hour and the product was cold with no heat from the warmers. I even left them out for 15 minutes with no heat coming from them. Tossed them in the trash. I returned the remaining warmers with a nice explanation of my experience and to my surprise I was only credited back for the returned, unused items with out any consideration for the shipping. I even called and talked to a company representative without any success concerning my experience with this product. All products received had valid expiration dates way into the future. Product simply did not work."
1,Maybe I got a defective product,"I bought a 3 pack from esportsonline through Amazon. I opened them and almost instantaneously they started to warm. In 3 minutes, they were hot in my shoes, almost uncomfortably hot but that's because I had thin socks on. After 1 hour, they turned cold and stiff. Maybe mine were defective. I'll give them another try and update this review then. Update: 2nd pair didn't last more than an hour. Weird. I never had this problem with the Grabber toe warmer."
4,Wonderfully warm,"I have purchased these foot warmers for years. They always worked great. Within the last 2 years, Grabber changed their design from beige to white. The white ones don't heat up as well as the beige ones. Not sure why, but there was a noticeable difference. I still love them and will continue to buy. I tried another brand that was on Amazon where you had to peel the backing and attach to your socks. BIG mistake. I recommend these over any other brand."
2,Really? They heat?,"To what, room temperature? I put a pair of these inside my shoes (outside my socks, which were of normal thickness) and MAYBE there was some warmth for 3 hours hours. It really didn't feel warm--just slightly less cold while I was outside. I wouldn't buy them again."
2,Grabber foot warmers,"I was disappointed in this foot warmer. I was looking for a foot warmer that I could re-heat and put on my feet. My right foot is always colder than the left foot.If I could have changed the left foot warmer to fit my right foot then they wouldn't have seemed so expensive. I live in a part of Colorado that is very rural and this package was sent to the post office for my zip code; but, it was not my post office and I had to pay an additional shipping charge because the post office sent it to my post office that was only 5 miles away. I was not happy with the shipping process."
5,WOW!,"This is absolutely STUNNING, BEAUTIFUL & MAGICKAL work. It is electronic / trance / chillout / pagan / buddhist / spiritual to describe it in a limited amount of adjectives. Just a masterpiece. I write my Book of Shadows to this musick. Quite an incredible work of art. I recommend it to anyone who wishes to enter a spiritual mindset. Trust me!~Raven~"
4,"Great for managing older APC UPS, but can't do secure SMTP","Purchased one of these on FleaBay for residential use, to manage my SUA1000 UPS in the basement. The Web/SNMP card provides web access to the UPS functions and event log, and it can send email notification to 1-4 addresses in the event of power issues or UPS alerts. In my case this is beneficial because the UPS is powering a Cable modem/VoIP gateway rather than a PC. Additionally this card lets you configure what types of alerts, if any, go to each email address.I took off one star because this dated card does not support password-protected SMTP. Comcast locked down their SMTP servers a while back, at which point my Web/SNMP card was no longer able to send email to outside email domains (Google, Hotmail, etc). The only way I could get email notification working again was to send from a Comcast address to a second Comcast address that is pushed to my smartphone."
2,Don't bother,"Boo. I rushed to buy this book without reading its reviews, just because I loved its precursor. But, as often happens with sequels, this book offered nothing new. The main, interesting story was already told in the first book, and instead the author finds herself whining about not finding love and about not having enough money to buy herself a house. Not worth reading. I still gave this book two stars simply because I like the way the author writes, in a self-deprecating humorous style, but if I were to judge solely on content, one star would do it better justice."
5,Great read-no matter what your phase of life,"Reading this book was like having a good long visit with the author, whose ""Round Heeled Woman"" was an utter delight. Her voice comes through so strongly and engagingly; the writing is gorgeous; the stories are fascinating, the characters unforgettable--especially the main character: Jane Juska. The book's enjoyable without its references to ""Round Heeled Woman,"" and yet it draws the reader back into ""RHW"" in a way that made me want to go back and read RHW again."
2,Stop Blaming Your Parents,I found this very disappointing- by the time you are in your '70s- it's time to stop blaming your parents that your life did not go as you wanted.
2,not great.,"Very cheap looking and the solar charger and led light are very cheap/poor. Also, the LED light is so dim, it barely lights up at all.Wouldn't recommend it. (I paid $4.23 ... which made it just acceptable to keep)"
1,wrong item,I received some product that is not even vaguely close to what I ordered. The only thing I can say is that it has the american flag on it. BUT that is it.
1,NOT SOLAR,I'VE GOTTEN 2 THIS WEEK AND THEY HAVE BEEN THE PLASTIC FLAG AND NO SOLAR PARTS. I'LL BE RETURNING THEM.
1,Waste of Money,This watch lasted all of three weeks. Poorly made. Unfortunately I lost my receipt. Do not buy this product.
4,"Not quite Charlie, but don't let it stop you!","Having read some of the other reviews, I felt a need to respond. Of course it's not exactly like the TV special's soundtrack - what would be the point of that? No one can duplicate the marvelous, timeless work of Vince Guaraldi, but Mr. Chestnut does an excellant interpretive turn on it. Yeah, it's different, but it's remarkable jazz, wonderfully musical, and adds a little modernistic zing into the classics. If you want EXACTLY the soundtrack, then don't bother. If you like variety and true jazz, you will love this twist on V.Guaraldi's classics. Even Lucy couldn't find fault with this album (I DARE you not to get up and dance to this Latin-flavored ""Fur Elise""!!)."
5,Linus and Lucy,"For those of us that grew up in the 60's, 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' is a must see show, and must hear music. The song 'Linus and Lucy' is my favorite. I'm sure everyone that has played this CD at a Christmas party has had comments like 'Hey, I know that song. It's from Charlie Brown!' It's tradition at our house to watch the show and play the CD, it helps make it Christmas. Don't miss this one, you'll be very glad you bought it."
4,"Complements the ""original"" - stands on its own","I received this CD from a giver who thought it was the original Guaraldi CD; so I was a little disappointed at first - but this recording has grown on me. Chestnut has reproduced the original Guaraldi themes on a few tracks, but more of the tracks are variations on his own new theme (stated in Track 1), mixed with new arrangements of Christmas standards and solid backing from a list of light jazz all-stars. I have both this CD and the Guaraldi Christmas in the changer, and shuffle them together - a perfect blend."
5,A Touch Of Oscar,"When one listens to his interpretation of Torme's Christmas Song, you can hear a distinct and ironic likeness to Oscar Peterson. This disc is superb from the careful selection of the original Vince Guaraldi LP's tunes with some tasteful backup by todays who's who of light jazz.Fur Elise takes a slightly different approach to the Beethoven classic with the latin rythyms. But unlike some efforts this one really is tastefully done.This is one of the discs you can buy intending to decorate the tree by since it has a traditional program with a touch of today's jazz. A real winner here, and let me cue you all to two things. Listen to Guaraldi's Mass, if you can find it. With Respect to Nat, by Peterson will intrigue you. You'll see my point. Much of Guaraldi's Mass was incorporated into the CB catalog. And The surprise that followed the studio playbacks of OP's Nat King Cole disc must have followed Chesnuts singing here! It all is a treat."
3,"NOT the original, but solid and enjoyable nonetheless","This is a great tribute to the original Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack that most of us remember. However, the key word is ""tribute.""Each song on this recording has its own ""twist"" from the originals, whether it is subtle or dramatic. Cyrus' arrangements are ultra-pleasant to listen to, as is the bulk of his other recorded work. As such, these updated songs which reflect the love put into them by Cyrus SUPPLEMENT Vince Guaraldi's original 1965 sessions, rather than REPLACE them. Nothing ever could replace the originals, especially for us purists! (I'm sure Cyrus himself feels the same way!)So...keep an open mind -- and enjoy the smooth and mellow stylings of this recording that gets better with each listen."
4,"Good, Common Sense Overview","Good common sense overview of the issues and mechanisms available for investing in real estate. This book touches on a lot of good topics, but can be confusing in places. It's a good primer for furhter reading. Well worth the money."
5,Have to read the book to judge it.,"This book is really just an insight to Chi Kung. Its a wonderful book but mostly about meditation and wonders Chi Kung works, not very great for trying to learn moves of Chi Kung. Kiew Kit Wong is an amazing teacher though. I have 2 other books of his that are very informative."
2,The Art of Chi Kung,"I have practiced Chi Kung for some time but Wong Kiew Kit's Methodology and uniqueness is very impressive. Somehow the Chi becomes as real and noticeable as anything else real and noticeable around us. And its impact is immediate. The book it is written to allow you do do probably 30-50% of the exercises without the help of a Chi Kung Master. And the first reaction at the end of the book is to search for one to continue the journey. I believe this tye of Chi Kung should be introduced in schools everywhere around the world.Dan Dumitrescu Henley, UK"
5,Best Pocket PC Ever,"I have had this for about three weeks and think it is great,have had Palm M505 and have tried out Hp Jornada 568 also almost all of the Ipaq's and have not found any that match this one,the combination of a CF card slot and a SD card slot is great,also it is the most inexpensive to have a intel Xscale 400MHZ processor.There are so many thing on this I could not mention them all you really need to try one out,I am not at all suprised to see Dell put one over on HP and the rest of the high priced crooks."
2,Dell Customer Service leaves a lot to be desired.,"I've been reading the reviews about Dell Customer Service on Amazon and other shopping web sites. I was relieved to see that I was not the only one that has expeirenced the difficulties dealing with Dell. They continue to show a lack of organization and because of that I'm now sure they spend a lot of time apologizing to their customers. Tech support is a hit or miss depending who you talk to, if you can understand what they are saying.The real problem is the consumer continues to purchase Dell computers, therefore continuing to make Michael Dell richer. When customers take their business to other competitors and Dell's sales go down, then I believe they will improve their customer service and tech support.If anyone from Dell reads this review, you should be concerned that so many of your cutomers are experiencing similar problems with Dell. The day may come that you won't make money in spite of yourself."
5,highly recommended,"the dell axim is my first pocket pc and my experiences have been great from the very beginning. i ordered it and it arrived in a few days and i fired it up and i am still impressed with the product. i purchased a presenter to go cf and am now using it for powerpoint presentations. with the cf and sd card slots, the storage capacity is awesome. making it the best deal around."
3,"good product, atrocious service","I find the product to be what it purports to be. And it has excellent battery life. But one thing overrules my good opinion of the product: very bad service. I guess Dell has an arrangement with people who speak with significant accents. That is fine. But when I have difficulty understanding what they are saying, I expect they would bear with me and see things through.Twice they hung up on me for asking to "" please repeat that more slowly."" I suspect they are tired of hearing that. But accents can be difficult to handle. Also, unlike service for their computers, the help has often been out and out wrong.I have no problem with people who have accents ( to many of us ); my folks are immigrants.That is not the issue. Service and politeness are issues.Dell has a serious service problem. So much so that I like the product but couldn't possibly recommend it. Too bad. I wish Dell would remedy this problem."
1,Axim crashes,"I recently bought an Axim after reading the reviews here at Amazon. However, these reviewers all appear to have purchased their Axims prior to mid-June of this year, when Dell began shipping the device with the new operating system, Windows Mobile 2003. Dell now has MAJOR problems with the product--it is extremely slow, they have halted new shipments while they try to develop a patch, and there are multiple irate customers posting messages on Dell's ""community forum"" message board. For the short time that I had my Axim, I found it extremely frustrating to use due to its slowness, and my e-mail exchanges with Dell's technical support did nothing to reassure me as to an eventual solution to the problem. My Axim is now en route back to Dell for a refund, and I'm using my old Handspring Visor again with no problems."
1,this sucks can i give negative 5 stars?,This crashed 15 times and the os sucks wast of money get a zire 72 it works!!!
1,"Good price, but...","While the Axim is probably the most affordable Pocket PC on the market today, anyone who is serious about quality should look at the Compaq iPAQs (especially the 3955). Sure, they cost about a hundred and fifty bucks more, but with the 3955 you get a much brighter, crisper screen, greater durability, a whole assortment of awesome programs, and best of all: you don't have to worry about the terrible customer service at Dell."
1,Product received was useless to me,"Product came with no way to hook up to the internet or a computer. Emailed many times then returned in the same packaging stating item not wanted. I still have not received my money back.As I could not connect to anything, I have no idea whether this item is good or not.02/13/2013 STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED A CREDIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,hand held,i just like the little hand held. I have had no problems with purchased software for this little dell.
4,The Best Little PDA in Texas,"Pros: Powerful versatile and affordable and as expected from DELL, great customer support.Cons: A little bulky but still small enough to fit in your pocket.So, why is the AXIM better than the others...dude, it's a DELL."
2,Buggy,"The Axim has a bug that even Dell customer support will grudgingly confirm. Sometimes the unit will stay on after you power it off and slowly drain down the battery. After a few times of this, the reserve battery drains as well, and POOF! no more data.happens to me on my Axim. No software fix yet."
1,A complete failure,"When I was given this device i assumed it would perform to all of my expectations, and at first it did, that was then, 7 months later i cannot open my contacts list under any circumstances, the battery indcator is not accurate, the device will not sync, it looses infromation of every kind at random, the camera and wireless networking acessories do not work with the product, and Dell customer service is useless. This is the second time i have had to deal with an inferior product from Dell, only to be stonewalled and lied to by their customer service, who are more interested in convincing you to buy more of their products than helping you. I will never buy another Dell product, i give this device the absolute worst rating possible because that is what it has earned."
2,Not all was true in the specific features given by seller,"In specific features seller said that it is like new.But I received 300MHz Pocket PC(must 400),without the cradle and Companion CD!"
3,Pretty good,"My dad bought this with a dell laptop for a great deal of 80 dollars. After a year or two in a forgoten cabnet, I found the charger and hooked it up to the computer and put my camra's flash card inside. With 256 mb that is as much storage as an ipod shuffle!!! I listen to music all the time on my axim. Windows media 9 is an easy enough program to navigate. It took me a while to learn how to use everything, but it was well worth it. Why is it rated a 3 stars? My axim is locked up right now, and looking at pictures is never efficent. It takes at least 5 minutes to load the thumbnails and 3 minutes to load the actual picture. and when you do get to the picture, it sorta freases up. It is clear that the dell axim is not worth 250 dollars, unless you like collecting junky software."
3,Sync Problem? Help here.,"I love the device and I deplore the service. Dell customer support spent most of their time trying to get me out of their hair for a few days and almost no time trying to figure out why the unit couldn't hold a syncing connection. Finally, a third-level support guy figured it out. The unit is too sensitive to plug into a USB hub. It has to go directly to the computer because it can't handle the fluctuations in current, I guess. Once I plugged it in directly, it worked great!...which is weird because my Jornada's been plugged into that selfsame hub for two years with no problems. All in all, I love the unit and hate the support...like everybody else."
1,Screen Froze and No Option to Repair,"Up until recently I have enjoyed the Axim. That is, until the screen froze. It no longer responds to the stylus. I called Dell Tech Support (if you can call it that) and they told me THEY DO NOT REPAIR THE AXIM. My only two options were to trade in my existing Axim for the same model (yeah, right) which would cost me about $150, or buy a completely new pda. They don't even have a service dept. for the Axim. I couldn't believe that any company would put their name on a product and not stand behind it. DO NOT BUY DELL."
4,why do I even like these guys?,"They guys are a power metal band from Spain from the 80's. They kind of sound like a spanish singing judas priest. I don't care for spanish or power metal that much but I really enjoy listening to these guys. Most of these songs will have you banging your head and of course there is a ballad which is really good. If you like power metal then you should get this cd and their other ones, even if you don't understand spanish."
3,The Snake Tatoo,"I just started reading Linda Barnes' Carlotta Carlyle mysteries. I am into detective mysteries and enjoy them. Unfortunately, I don't feel a lot of intensity in the action and character. I am going to finish the series and see."
5,It's Just That No One Taught You How,"I took oil painting classes from Bill Martin 40 years ago and still think of him as the best art teacher I ever had. Why? Because he had a knack for laying out an organized and readily understandable structure...step by step. One of those steps is drawing. Don't think you can't draw; it's just that no one taught you the basics. How wonderful that Bill Martin wrote it all down...that his gift for teaching lives on. Plus he was such a good guy. Now all you have to do is practice, practice, practice."
4,quantum ultra lite,what is shown is not what you get. I got straight cork handle. Thought I was getting what was pictured. not a goos practice to show one and send another!!!!
2,"Dark, bleak and unforgiving","While Talk Talk offered up some inspired moments (Colour of Spring) and endeavoured to break down traditional musical barriers (see Spirit of Eden), this solo offering from Mark Hollis - the band's singer/songwriter - is blacker than black. It continues in the same vein as Laughing Stock, and indeed is an introspective, intriguing record as you'll likely to find. BUT, there's something about this record that sends the spirit spiralling down into deep depression. It's dry like a gravestone, it creaks like an old coffin, and is completely bereft of any kind of kind of humour. I don't know whether anybody out there agrees with me. This is the only record I've ever heard that has had this effect on me. This to me is music that is the closest thing to unhappiness in sound I have ever heard."
1,destroyer of expectations,From the legacy of the playstation format to this crap was a great disapointment. The turn based isn't as enjoyble as previous titles.
5,Awesome strategy game!,"I bought this game a while ago, and it's still fun as hell! This game is a great combination, strategy/anime. This game has a couple things in common with Advance Wars, it also has even more stategy than Advance Wars. You gotta pick the right vehicle and attack for the right enemy. This is truly worth the money, oh yeah I forgot to mention the great graphics and storyline!"
3,"Interesting Idea, sloppy execution","This game has a great story, but it didn't need to be told in incredibly long cut scenes... It could've been done in a Silent Hill style game where it is more of an interactive story. Instead they , for some of the strategy is genius, but most is not. They then made a skeet-shooting style battle system, which ""Duck Hunt"" for NES did better.If you like a story and have quick reflexes for the battles, get this game, but if you were expecting really good action and strategy, go for TOM CLANCY'S RAINBOW SIX for GBA"
3,Game?,"...I bought ZOE: The Fist of Mars for GBA about 2 weeks later (I'm a very busy person and the only time i get to play is in transit 1 hour and 45 min a day roughly) i beat it. Now i'm not saying that it's a bad game because i don't think it's 100% a game. More like 35% target practace/strg game and 65% Anime Comic book.On the whole though it was an ok game, some thing diffrent, it's kind of like playing a game with a split personaltyBuy it if you've played all the good games and don't want to give into the ...[bad] games just yet cause they have nothing better out yet"
3,Good but not a substitute for the Anonymous Four,"Hungry for more of the shape-note singing the Anonymous Four do so beautifully on their CD ""American Angel,"" I purchased this CD. It pales in comparison but is till a good collection of early American hymns."
5,Excellent pencils,The pencils in this set were superb. Very professional quality - pencils just glided over the page and the colors were fantastic.
5,Simply the Best,Prismacolor is the top of the line.Artists use them for a reason.Use them once and you'll fall in love.Creamy texture.Delicious color.
3,Banged up tin,I love Prismacolor pencils and have used them in the past. My disappointment lies in the fact that the tin they came in was dented and scratched. The damage didn't happen during shipping. . .it was apparent that the damaged product was placed in the box before shipping. Shame on Amazon for shipping damaged goods.
5,Seventy two colors!,"These are lovely pencils but it's just like the cable TV, there are always some you will never use and some that aren't quite there. But the Amazon price was great. But I couldn't resist the 12 pack at Michael's after Christmas for $2.99 and it did have different colors!"
5,Better than expected,Ordered these for my son. He enjoys drawing and the soft-cores make shading easier. He was very pleased with the set and I was happy with the price and very please with the turn-around time on the order.
5,Colered Pencils,"This was purchased to be a gift. The donee had asked for it and appears to have been very pleased with it.As for 'Entangled' (the purchase listed above), I have no recollection of it."
4,Pleased by the price and the product.,"This was my first set of Prismacolor Colored Pencils and I was very happy with this purchase. I always like to see what kind of deals I can get, and I was very happy with the one. My only complaint was that the color slipped right out of the middle of two of the pencils. Apparently not enough glue was applied during production. Get your game together Prismacolor. Arrived promptly, packaged nicely, and in good condition."
5,Prismacolor pencils,"These pencils are great...wonderful, vibrant, clear color. I have never used colored pencils before and I must admit that they live up to their reputation. I just wish I had went for the largest set. Since I am doing portraits I need to order several more skin tones (I bought the set with 72 pencils)."
2,Box had big dent on the top,"One star for sending me a box with a big dent in it. Pencils are fine, but I can't stop staring at this damaged container that I have to store them in."
4,Are these Prism Color Pencils permanent,If I use water on the pencils will they slowly wear away or are they permanent.
2,Quality Issues!,"Sanford is having quality issues with its Prismacolor and Verithin brands, enough to make me consider switching to Derwent.I've recently purchased the 72, 120, and 132 pencil Prismacolor sets and there were one or more problems with each set. My problems included getting getting duplicates of one or more colors while missing other colors, non-centered leads that caused sharpening issues, bent and curved pencils that made heir use awkward, imprints that were barely legible, chipped and gouged pencils, and imperfectly finished pencils.A box of 36 Verithin pencils had the same problems and was also missing a pencil.For the price paid for these pencils, you should expect perfection and you're not getting it. These used to be my favorite pencils. Sanford's shoddy quality control has caused me to downgrade my opinion of them."
2,Prismacolor Premier 72,"Pros:nice colormetal tinCons:most of the 72 pencils are bent 3/4 of the way down the pencil shaft4 of the 72 pencils were shorter by at least 25%Have had troubles sharpening pencils. Color core is broken and sharpened tips falls out gravity assist only.I hope this is just a lemon box but do not think I will buy this product again and will be very weary of any Prismacolor Pencils.second star for fast delivery, pencils alone would be a 1 star"
3,Not exactly 72 different colors,I was very dissapointed in the lack of colors that were in the tin. the discription said 72 colors and the top section was good and the second and third sections were exactly the s ame colors. I enjoy coloring in the flower and butterfly coloring books and so wanted some different shades and colors and did not get what the suggested discription said it would be.
4,short new nubs,Unfortuantely as excited as I was to receive my Prismacolor pencils I soon found that the package must have been dropped or the pencils are deffective. Many of the pencil leads just keep breaking off when I sharpen them. This has resulted in half size pencils in my brand new box :(
4,Picture misleading,"The pencils are really great in terms of colour. These are my first pencils so I can't compare with any other brands out there.However, the quality is average. Some pencils have black branding, others have silver. Some also have large white branding. Others have chipped ends.The picture is misleading because it shows a pencil sharpener included in the tin when there isn't one. If I had known, I would have bought a sharpener too."
1,Used to be great.,I grew up on Prismacolor pencils using them since the 1960's. They used to work great. I don't know what happened but lately they break with the lightest pressure. Some pencils have been totally unusable. I never had to use any special sharpener. The prismacolor sharpener on Amazon didn't get very good reviews either. I'm switching brands. My fellow artists in the animation industry have shared the same story with me- worthless colored powder.
5,Great customer,"Received the Prisma colored pencils in great shape and arrived quickly, my daughter loves them !"
5,"Black America, read this now!","Every black person in the United States ought to devote an evening or two to reading this book. It shows in a concise 100-plus pages that ""Black History"" includes the triumphs of self-sufficiency which were considered ordinary before the Civil Rights movement taught the race that ""progress"" meant handouts and lowered standards of evaluation. The inner cities are slowly rising out of the ashes, not through government charity but through residents working the system to change their own destinies, making their peace with an unfair past. No book says this better. Everyone -- buy this book and regain your hope."
5,"comprehensive, great value","The authors of this book did an extraordinary amount of work, providing us with 3 entirely different, but complementary, perspectives for people born on each day of the year. I find the astrological, kabbalistic and numerological reviews fascinating, and there's an extra column for each spread that provides insight into objects, colors, sounds and other everyday things that have special significance to the person of the day. Amazing stuff."
5,Lots of space to store songs and nice features...,"I purchased this MP3 player and I'm very surprised and pleased with its price for only less than $40 for a MP3 player with 512MB capacity. The shipping is quick also. I was able to load 150-170 MP3 files on this gadget. It has a built in rechargeable battery that can only be charged via USB connected on PC but a DC adapter can be purchased. I have not really checked on its battery life but it does not require disposable batteries like other MP3 players within its price range. This player also has a LCD display and can be customized with images using the software included. Overall, I highly recommend this item."
1,Pontoon boat fender,I ordered 4 fenders for a 2009 Suntracker 22 SF Pontoon boat. It was not as advertised. It was suppose to be inflatable vinyl. Instead it appears to be hard PVC. It appears that it would not function well to absorb force. The force would be transmitted to the railing. It does not conform to the shape of the railing on my pontoon boat easily. Finally it was overpriced at approximately $50 per fender. I returned all four fenders for a refund.
2,read before you buy,This fender is not at all like the description it is made of hard plastic not soft vynal or pvc. You could tie a piece of 4 inch abs drain pipe on the side of your pontoon railing and get the same or better protection. The strap will loosen and it will walk down the railing as it bumps into the dock and your rails take the shock transferd from the bumper.if you want the inflatable bumper you better look for the fencsaver 2 not this one.
1,Do not order this item,"I did not realize how old this pagemaker software is. Our Arts Center replaced an administrative assistant who had many files saved with the p65, but we could never open them. I had to install this software on an older computer and download several different software updates in order to open any files and even then, I only was able to open a couple. I would like to return it but I had to license it in order to use it. I would not recommend to anyone."
1,could have been really good but....,"the characters, like the plot,tend to fizzle early on, causing this book to be a boring read after the initial promise of star crossed love. instead we get a conflicting strong alpha male hero who, by the end of the book, degenerates into tears quite a lot and mostly over nothing.our heroine, on the other hand, who is portrayed as having virtually no experience dealing with emotional issues, forces a pseudo-reconciliationbetween the hero and his father. i wanted so much for this book to be stronger as i think the character of billy blade could have been a greatfully fleshed out person. if that had happened i probably could have put up with jacinda and her blonde corkscrew curls falling all over the place. as one reviewer said,if you must read this, get it from the library and save your money for a better buy."
2,Not as good as the first three.,"After totally enjoying the first three books in this series, I found Lady of Desire greatly lacking. The only reason I gave it two stars was because of the character of Billy Blade. Ms. Foley seems to deal better with her leading men. Lady Jacinda was perfectly awful. She's spoiled and willful, but where that could play for humor, I just found her annoying. Billy deserved far better. Hopefully Ms. Foley can make her next female subject more interesting."
3,"""Off to a good start""","first i'd like to say I love Gaelen Foley. One of my favorite authors. However this story had to be a rush job. It was off for a ggod start but the middle and ending was terrible. First all I became pissed off when and gotten all the way to page 300 and still no sex scene yet. The hero's (Rackford) character starts out as brave, courageous, rougish and progressivley turns into this sappy weakling. I mean Lady Jacinda was a aristocratic Bitch throughout the entire story. SHe treated him like pure dirt for no reason. I hate that kind of heroine and hero. I found it surprising that GF would even write such a story."
4,"Absolute great read, love the Knight series",I loved this book. This was a touching story showing how Billy Blade overcame his tortured past. Jacinda showed herself to be a strong heroine. The character development really impressed me. I'm anxiously awaiting the next book.
3,Actually..3 1/2 stars.......,"I discovered Gaelen a few months back when I read her book ""The Pirate Prince""...Since then I've devoured each book that she has written..I was soooo excited to read Jacinda's and Billy's story....Billy was soo romantic..so much more than I had imagined him to be..this book could have easily been a 5 star read,but Jacinda just seemed a bit too flat..not mature enough ..I felt that they werent adequately matched, but putting that niggle aside....this is definitely a must read for any fan of this series..I'm telling you Im dying due to anticipation ...I CANNOT wait for Alec's book!!!!!!"
5,Great for Asthma,"I stumbled on this by chance, since there nothing out there regarding this. L-Arginine works wonders for my Asthma. So good in fact I have stopped taking my very very expensive prescription medicine, Symbicort. One in the morning and one at night and my Asthma is under control. Never ordered this brand before, but I am sure they are all essentially the same."
1,Makes No Difference !,"To be honest, I noticed no difference at all. Not sure if this product is a diluated version of the true extract or not. I'd look elsewhere at your local Vitamin Store if this is what your wanting to do and try."
2,Instructions ask for big dose,"That size of that dose got me dizzy and light headed, youre better off getting Ginseng, I cant verify that this works, thats whats wrong, but I can tell you the Ginseng works but gives you a headache!"
1,Fake don't work,It would seem that either this product just does not work or it is just fake and does not have any of the ing in the pills that is says it has. I would not waste you money on this product.
2,L-Arginine,"Another worthless product, sorry I wasted my money; should have done more research bofore investing. what else do you want me to say?"
1,It did not work for me,"I specially bought this item to increase sex level. After using more than 3 weeks, I noticed that it has decrease my sex level. So I threw it into the garbage.It does not work for me, just waste of money. So I do not recommend this product."
3,Ok not great,"I cant that I have seen any results from using this product. I have been using it now for over a month and I dont feel that I have changed at all. I was hoping for a little ed boost in blood flow, but there has been no change at all."
2,Gout?,"I used the product for two weeks and slowly worked up to two, three times a day. Then I came down with gout!"
4,New for me,"This is a new Amino Acid for me to take. The caps are small enough to be easy to swallow, so I take with my regular vitamins."
4,ED trial,"I'm combining L-Argamine with YOHIMBINE HCL and L-Glutamine as WebMD said that, athough most herbal ED supplements are near worthless, these three together may help with erectile dysfunction. I've only been using them three weeks and they may be helping a little but need more time to find the truth. I'm watching Yohimbine HCl carefully for side affects as it is the only one with warning labels.I'll report back in a couple of months."
2,didnt notice anything,"I bought this product just to try it. I really didn't notice any difference in my workouts. Amazon is always a great place to buy things but I won't buy this again. Creatine and a protein are all that's really works for me. I'm not a hardcore bodybuilder, just like to lift."
2,hard to tolerate,"I don't know if it was the thin capsule & quick absorption that made me sick or what. maybe it's just the actual l-arginine I couldn't tolerate, but I've had no problems with other supplements/larger pills in the past."
1,Had to throw off lot of tablets.,I had to throw off a lot of them since the tables were puffed and was not usable. I had bought this for two times the first time was good but the second time I noticed this. I also noticed the same in L-Cartine tablets and had to throw them also away.
3,"Prefer the Jarrow 1000mg capsules, but these are okay","Used to buy the 1000mg capsules from Jarrow. Those were easy to swallow, not much bigger than these - and you could take half as many (which was more convenient). Could just be my perception of it - but the Jarrow did seem to give more benefit to pumps in lifting, which makes me think it could be better quality than the Now (which I think of as more of a value brand). Jarrow also lists the supplier of the active ingredient, which is reassuring.I'd go for the Jarrow - if it's available, but this product is fine as a backup."
1,Terrible,"The only thing it did was giving me terrible nightmares. it doesn't work, and I strongly recommend you not to buy it"
2,NOT ENOUGH LESTER!!!,"First, let me state, I am a huge Lester Young Fan. As a sax player, myself, he is my musical idol. This book is so vague, it hardly covers the man at all. The author is more concerned with the racism and segregated history of jazz. This is o.k. but should be in a different book. We want more on the man. Also, there are errors in the telling. Just two come to mind. Jefferson Davis was born in Kentucky not Mississippi and Lionel Barrymore was not an alcoholic, his brother, John was. Don't get me wrong, this book is a huge undertaking for the story it tells but alot of it is ""probably"", ""maybe"", ""people think."" It's way too vague on the facts. It is , however, worth a look because there is alot of jazz history worth reading about. I've read the author's other works and they are much better."
1,Not a very good source on Pres,"I don't know what the author's intentions were in writing this book, but it certainly seems as though the life of Lester Young was not the main topic. Daniels spends more time on topics like racism and the unfair treatment of black musicians rather than actually talking about Lester Young. While it is important to talk about these topics in some detail to explain how it affected Lester Young, the author did not have to spend over half the book on them. Here's a little advice Mr. Daniels: If you're going to write a book on the racial inequalities of these times, write a book specifically on that, and with a title that suggests that topic. Don't write a book with a title of ""The Life and Times of Lester ""Pres"" Young"" and spend nearly the whole time talking about racism and racial inequalities."
3,The times of any black musician?,"I'm a saxophonist and a teacher in jazz conservatory in Helsinki, Finland. So I was very excited, when I found out that a new book about this strange character had been published. However, not much light came upon the man himself, nor his music. Still, I admire very much the precision that all the knowledge available about the man is presented. Also, the good thing is that the author does not try to analyze his recordings, analyses are often very boring. Musicians don't need them and the others don't understand. Still, where is Lester?"
2,Highly biased!,The author is an African-American militant and he's more worried on pamphletizing his political views than on narrating Prez's life. His views of the Jazz world are extremely naive and he tends to idealize everything related to African-Americans. One's got to be balanced...
2,"ah, jimbo, why can't you win?","really, skip this half-baked jam session and go buy ""Stop and Let the Devil Ride"" (which inexplicably sells for like $28 or whatever on here). that's the album that will make you realize jimbo mathus is the unsung hero of drunken southern boogie rock. this album, however, just ain't got the grit, man, the swagger of that other gem."
5,"Wonderful Product, I can't wait to display it next Christmas",I received a Nativity Scene for Christmas and the stable matches it perfectly. I can't wait to display it next Christmas
5,Lexmark #31 Photo Cartridge,"The Cartridge is great. It was just what I was Looking for. I would reccommend this to anyone with the lexmark x4650 printer. It is great for Printing your pictures. With this cartridge you can print in black and white, and in color."
1,they send me the wrong ink cartridge,I requested the 31 colored lexmark ink and the send me another number that dosnt mach with my printer and now my printer gives me errors I want to return It but I dont know how please help???????
1,Dissapointed,"It took a long time to arrive. The product was good the first page, then the color started running. I e-mailed seller, returned the product, and did not hear from seller about the return. Seller said he never recieved the product. Luckly, Amazon returned my money. I will never buy from this seller again."
2,No Gold Medal For This,"This is a dull game(what a surprise!Another dull Gamecube game!)in which each event consists of pressing one or two buttons over and over again.The best event is ice dancing,but even that is disappointing.It involves trying to press your green button over and over at the exact right time.The more accurate you are,the better the figure-skater will perform.The less accurate you are,the more they will fall or miss special moves.Warning;as someone who never suffers motion-sickness,I got sick while watching the flasing arrows and trying to press my button just as they hit the spot theyre supposed to.All in all,a disappointing and boring game."
2,Should u buy it or not?,"I think first of , I just wasted my money on this game . It may have OK graphics but it has some flaws with this game .If u really want to try this out then just rent the game first . This is the worst game I've ever played . It's not that exciting either . These are my rating for this game.....Graphics:6/10There are some flaws .Gameplay:6/10There is really nothing to do on this game . Only a few things that are actually easy.Sound:5/10The game doesn't seem to have any music . The crowd cheers seem very (blaa) .Replay Value:6/10I don't really think ur going to play this game over and over again.Overall:6/10(2/5)I don't think u should buy this game unless ur really into the Winter Olympics."
2,Is this really a GameCube game?,"Yup, that's right. This game looks like a high-res N64 game. It's filled graphical flaws and you will find that the whole game is boring, boring, boring, and boring. The game goes from bad to worse as you play it. Skip this one and get...anything else. I don't care! Just stay away from it!"
1,Avoid Wasting Money on this Game; Strongly DO NOT Recommend,"Great Aspects:If you really, really liked the 2002 Winter Olympics (and more specifically, winter sports), then you might possibly get a little enjoyment out of this game. The curling game is probably the only real entertaining aspect of this game.Downside:Almost everything else. The graphics, commentary, and music are truly terrible and the controls in most of the sports events are oddly arranged and trivial and has almost nothing to do with the sport involved. There is no motivation to really acheive success in any of the sports involved.Summary:This game gets boring really fast and is a complete waste of time and money. Need I say more?Strongly DO NOT Recommend."
3,Parrapa the Rapper 2,"Parappa the rapper 2 is fun. it is really easy to finish. i beat the game in 1hour and15 minutes. it is short. i think you should ren t this game.the story is about parrappa iwins a lot of noodles and he gets tired of eating them . and the n some bad guys try to make the whole city eat noodles.there are 8 levels in the game.they are: a restaraunt ,at parrapa's house , at parrappa's house when they get shrunk,the barber shop, a training place,at a concert , and at a place where you battle the noodle bad guy,and a video game"
1,Parappa loses it's appeal,"I am a huge fan of the original. The songs were great, the gameplay smooth and challanging, and while it was short, I would always find myself coming back for more. Parappa 2 however, shares none of these qualities. It boasts no new songs worth praise, and horrible gameplay. I beat it without losing once in less than an hour. Another long awaited sequel that should have never been made. Very sad."
1,A MUSIC game with a major design flaw: NO DIGITAL AUDIO OUT.,"I rented this yesterday for a 3-year-old, figuring the music and graphics would be something she'd enjoy.Imagine my chagrin when the game came on and there was NO SOUND. I poked and prodded and looked for options, but couldn't find any indication of why it didn't work.Someone online had the answer for me: for whatever reason, the producers of this game elected not to include a digital audio out sound track.It's a music game. Hello?My PS2 is integrated into my home theatre system--to maximize performance, it's hooked up with a component video cable and an optical digital audio cable. If your system is hooked up in a similar way, you will not hear the audio for this game without reconfiguring your PS2 hookup.On my system, a bad design choice makes this game unplayable. Zero stars."
1,A dog in a rapper outfit that dances.....not the best. ~_ ~,"PaRappaTheRappa 2 is not only a tremendously long title,but a pice of trash.It's about this midget dancing dog.He gets a life time supplies of noodles.(um....)And that's all he thinks about.there's 3 words to describe this game:NOODLES-DANCING-LAMEWhatever you don't buy this game!!!Unless you like midget dogs in a rapper outfit that dances.sincerly,kenny"
2,Very Short review for a very short game..,"I rented this game back when it hist stores and i must say THANK GOD I DIDN'T buy this game!! The visuals are reasonably good, the dioloug is pretty funny and the music is cool but this game is extreamly short, It took me about less then 3 hours to beat this game and I immidiatley returned the game..\Overall PaRappa the Rapper 2 isn't worth the money AT ALL...Very short game...2.4 out of 5 stars..."
3,fun... but short,"i think this is a very fun, simple, and entertaining game. the beats just keep you coming back for more. i love the 2-D Cel-Shaded graphics, although many people prefer 3-D. every once in a while you will see one or two 3-D things, which i must admit work just amazingly mixed with the 2-D, which now that i think about it, i would have preferred. my only real gripes with this game is that not much has changed since Parappa 1, and the other thing is the length. its amazingly short. you could probably beat it max. 6 hours, and thats if you really stink at the game. but now that the price has dropped i highly reccomend that you look into giving up [the money] for this quick gaming fix. its the most fun ive had with a more kiddie-aimed game in a longgg longggg time."
1,THIS GAME SUCKED!,"THis is probably the worst video game of all time!!!! The visuals are horrible and 2-D on PS2 does not look good! The Songs were very Odd , and the stupid songs are stuck in my head!I origianally thought that this game was going to be a fun button mashing game, I didn't.. I beat in in 2 hours. So unless you are around 3 to 7 years old.....DO NOT PLAY THIS GAMEAND DEFINETLY DON'T BUY IT!"
3,Old school,The Basic Stamp is a bit dated and low power but it is a great place to start. This book is also dated; some of the ICs in it are no longer available. But a great thought provoking set of ideas to help move your projects forward.
4,Great Illustration of How One Photographer Uses Light,I enjoyed the ideas Michael Grecco has for using light. The examples are well-explained so the reader can come up with his own ideas. I highly recommend this book if you're looking for new ideas for lighting or needing to learn how to use light when taking photographs.
5,Outstanding lighting cookbook for serious portrait photographers.,"This is an outstanding lighting cookbook for serious portrait photographers, though it's not written for newbies. I appreciate the fact that there is a lighting diagram for each setup, and his original idea behind it. It's well-written with precise description of what lights and mods used for each setup. Besides, each image in the book is a b&w image which makes much more sense because you I can easily judge the effectiveness of the lighting in B&W images."
5,love it,"i am in love with this cd, have two already and if i could get more to give as a present i would"
5,Fenomeno,"If there's 1 CD that a true music lover needs for listening pleasure, you just landed on your jackpot. This CD is filled from beginning to end. No track on this CD is worth skipping. From his Worlwide smash hit ""Corazon Partido"" to Si hay Dios"". Truely a great musician, truely a great CD, Truely the Best Buy."
5,Alejandro es Asombroso,"Ale Sanz es el mejor cantante que haya escuchado! Crea sus propias palabras y dice mucho al publico y a su amiga en las canciones. Amiga Mia fue mi favorita. Si tuvieras que escoger entre todos los CDs en el mercado, este seria el mejor, sin falta. Nunca te cansaras de su musica que te aliviara el estres y te refrescara!!"
1,"sin ritmo, sin música, sin...","nada!Cuesta entender los comentarios positivos de este senor quien parece hacer lo posible para que la estrofa anterior no tenga ninguna relación con la siguiente: No tiene ritmo, la letra es tonta, llena de lugares comunes y además no tiene (si por lo menos esto se pudiera destacar) una voz. Ojalá los admiradores pudieran seguir el ritmo de una canción con un pie. Creo que se volverían locos (si es que no duermen antes) ... Quizás por eso el entusiasmo.Espana: Cuantos crímenes se cometen en tu nombre!"
2,Span Spam,"Lo siento, muchachos, pero la musica aqui no es bien. Good on this Sanz fella for writing his own songs. Big problem, however, the lyrics and their delivery drip with unalloyed sentimentality - cloying and annoying. Even worse is the ""backdrop"" music, a schlocky blend of bland piano and studio knob nauseola. This album's indulgences and general Celine Dion production values insult the true beauty of Latin music, which is always, and I mean always, best performed with acoustic instruments, not with a crooner and computer. Maybe the ""unplugged"" album is shorter on the slurp. Has to be."
1,"Por favor, escúchenlo a un volumen moderado si lo compran...","Tuve la mala fortuna de que una vecina adquirió este CD y al parecer le gusta muchísimo, ya que lo pone a un volúmen lo suficientemente alto como para que yo, quien vivo en otra casa, pueda escucharlo igual.Tras soportar involuntariamente más de un mes este álbum una y otra vez, creo que tengo autoridad suficiente para suplicarles que si alguien cree que ""Corazón Partío"" es una gran canción, (¡por favor!) se ponga audifonos. lo disfrutará igual y no torturará a los semejantes a quienes quizás sí les guste una canción donde exista armonía y donde la estrofa que escuchas tenga alguna relación con la anterior."
2,Boring,"My friends told me I'd like this. They were wrong. Song after repetitive song. Granted, I don't speak Spanish, but understanding the lyrics would not have saved this music for me. JMO"
5,Espanas no 1 son,* 5000000 records sold around the world and still counting. * The No 1 selling album in Spain of All Time (even selling more than the biggest Julio Iglesias album) * My Anglo-Australian girlfriend who hates ballads only makes two exceptions... they are Alejandro Sanz and Alejandro Fernandez.Nothing else needs to be said. A beautifully constructed Spanish pop album.
5,Viva Cadiz!,"Que exito para el guapito gaditano! Ay si yo fuera su amiga....No en serio, me gusto el CD porque oi ""Corazon Partio"" en las calles de Sevilla cada dia."
5,amazing,"Alejandro Sanz is not a singer, he is a poet, the musical structures he writes are absolute amazing (and I ought to know, since being a musician myself) but besides his impressive musical arrangements and production, what cautivated me the most are his abosolutelly amazing lyrics. Alejandro Sanz's vision of the world is very unique, the way he interprets what's around him, from ""corazon partio"" where he explains how it feels to have a broken heart, to ""siempre es de noche"" where he feels throught the heart of a blind man in love, it is simply outstanding.Great work from one of the most talented singer-songwriter of our time."
1,disappointing item,"I rodered these to use in the shower. The first & only time I put them on, I nearly fell in the shower...they were/are not in my opinion, definitely not non-skid. The cost, nearly $12. would be ok but the shiopping & handling (nearly $25.) unreal..I thought it wss a misprint when ordered...sorry. back they go !"
1,Tosches Trashes History,"This is the worst book I have tried to read in many years. It's a disorganized mishmash of shaky biblical scholarship, soft core porn, snarky comments on current events, and very little about Arnold Rothstein. I can cut writers a lot of slack. But Tosches' editors at Harper Collins should be held accountable for this dog's dinner of a book"
1,Holy moly!,"Tosches's book is ""The Da Vinci Code"" for tough guy college graduates who enjoy smoky dives in moderation and, when they got into their first and only fight, had the good sense not to exchange blows to the face."
2,Not His Best,"On the surface, this should be vintage Nick Tosches. However, the story is uneven and his ""voice,"" which is scattered throughout kind of interferes with what should be a very compelling story. It is worth reading, but is far from perfect."
3,Not very simple to use,Finale songwriter seems to have very little consideration for people who change their minds after the first set-up. I have not found ways to add an instument/voice or change the tempo gradually to the speed I like. I do not really recommend it.
4,Best deal for the money.,"Look, notation software is notoriously expensive. All musicians know that. So, when you see SongWriter and its price, it's a relief. Everything you need is in this program. I only have one complaint.When adding an expressive dynamic (p,mp,mf,f,ff,etc.) you have to add one to EACH note to insure proper playback. That is a concern of mine since I use SongWriter to notate songs and export them in MIDI for recording purposes. It leaves an ugly looking score.Other than that, this is the best deal on the market for what it is."
3,lousy handbook,"Although I was originally amazed at the ability to convert a midi file to paper, I was later very disappointed in the ability to make changes to the music.There is certainly a lot more in the program than I know of, but the handbook is poorly organized and not very helpful. It does not even explain what the cursor symbols mean. I had to call technical support for that. Their answer to my problem: purchase their other products.For $30 more, I could have purchased a more powerful product from Intelliscore."
3,Still not terribly user friendly,"This is the second Finale product I have purchased. The first was the full-blown version of the music writing software. I found it too difficult to learn to be of much use. Now several years later I thought I'd try again. Finale has fantastic capabilities in terms of what a composer can create on paper, but, again, I have found it to be rather user unfriendly. Things like an ability to use your mouse to scroll down a printer page of music appear to be absent. Ability to change the size of your document on the page (analogous to a ""font"" tool) are likewise missing. Thankfully, I have previous experience of working through a few basic concepts of the software to assist me with this new product.I found the tutorial of limited value since it only covers some very basic steps while leaving the user to figure out things like how to create a pick-up measure or how to eliminate the extra measures in a document."
2,I expect a much better user interface experience from Mac software,"I'm spoiled by Mac software that follows Apple's UI guidelines. This software is, frankly, ugly. My wife was disappointed that you can only play one handed to input your notes. Getting both hands in requires more effort and coordination.If you're a beginner you may not truly have the need to get notes to paper. If you're more advanced, I think you could spend more money and get a better product."
3,Shipping,"We received what we ordered.However, the product arrived 15 days after we ordered.This was disappointing as the order was a Christmas gift to my son who had two weeks off for winter break and had planned to use the product extensively. (Ordered Dec. 21st from Colorado, received in New Mexico Jan. 5th).When I complained to the supplier I received two rather nasty emails telling me to retract my hurtful comments. No other attempt to explain/justify/dialogue on what caused the delay.I was taken aback at the lack of decent customer service and just plain rudeness.I therefore could not recommend this supplier.Alice Jordan.Denver, Colorado."
1,Disappointed,"the strings on the sides of the bracelet that tie the turtle in place kept sliding to the sides. And it wasnt easy to adjust. I ended up taking the turtle off, going to the store and buying the necessary supplies to make my own leather hemp bracelet and put the turtle on that. Got to say, my bracelets are A LOT better! Also, the little beads that came on the ends of the adjustable strings fell off! This exact thing happened with a different turtle bracelet i bought here for my boyfriend!"
3,"Too sweet, not spicy enough.","For a German to complain that something is too sweet might seem strange, but this sauce is too sweet. There isn't enough ginger and jalapeño, and their ""notes"" fade after a few bites.Of course, whether you like a sauce is a matter of taste. If yours leans more to the spicy than the sweet, you probably won't find F&W; to your liking. And it's not a low-calorie product -- one tablespoon is 50 calories."
5,"Expected a Habanero Firecracker, got a Delicious Spicy Sweetness","I've only tried this once so far (just received it today!) but I'm compelled to review it now and promise more as I try it with fish, pork and chicken.This is so delicious it would even make your hamburger hug you with joy. I can see I'll be buying this by the case from Amazon, and I don't care that it's a little expensive...........I'm worth it!Added after emptying the bottle: I've had a lot of compliments on my cooking lately, thanks to this. I like it best on burgers, but it works well on everything I tried. Good on chicken strips too. But you can make a spicy burger just with buns, sauce and meat."
3,"Tasty, but not hot","You can taste the mango and ginger in this sweet sauce, but the habaneros did not make it into the bottle.Last night's dinner featured brined thick pork chops which were marinated in this sauce for an hour after after rinsing off the brine. They were then grilled for about ten minutes, basting after turning. The sugar in the sauce caramelized nicely on the grill. Before serving I poured a little more fresh sauce over the chops. The chops were very tasty and had a nice tropical flavor, but zero heat.Today I had the leftovers from the chops, with a little more sauce fresh from the bottle. I wanted to see if something had interfered with the taste of habaneros last night. Again the sauce had a strong flavor of mango and ginger, but was still not hot.To sum it up, this sauce is good, but not awesome. If you're looking for heat, you will have to try something different, or add it yourself. I'll definitely finish off what I have, but likely will not order again."
3,Veerryy sweet! A little too much for me.,"I tried this sauce on both beef and chicken. I haven't yet tried it on fish. The mango is the overriding flavor in this sauce and the manufacturer bolsters the mango sweet with even more sugar. The end result was too sweet for use on red meats and just a little too sweet on chicken. I am going to give it a try as an addition to a sesame chicken recipe I have and I think it will fit in very well there.Once the sweet fades a bit, you get hit with the habanero burn. I think it was balanced well so that it didn't burn too much. It would have been easy to really overpower with the pepper but they did a good job of keeping that from happening.Overall, not bad. A little heavy on the sweet side, but if sweet is what you desire, you could do much worse than to give this sauce a try."
4,"Not too sweet, not too hot- just the right amount of zing!","When I saw this contained habanero, I was concerned, as I am sensitive to hot peppers (I can't even eat a jalapeno). I used this as a dipping sauce with some grilled chicken, and enjoyed the zing it added. The Mango, ginger and habanero balanced each other, with the pepper adding just a touch of heat that was subdued by the other flavors.Although my favorite grilling sauces tend to be ginger and teriyaki variations, this was a nice change."
4,Sweet with a kick,"The initial taste is quite sweet, almost like a sweet and sour sauce. A few seconds later, *bam* the habaneros and ginger kick in. Definitely an interesting flavor with the fish I cooked up tonight. I'm sure it'll also go good with chicken. Fruit sauce with heat and it's all natural too. None of those funny ingredients you can't identify. I'm not sure it'll taste good with beef, though. Will need to experiment.Note: For people with allergens, they do say it's processed in a facility that also processes peanuts, tree nuts, milk, soy, and anchovies."
4,"Love the tangyness of ginger, spiciness of habanero, and sweetness of mango together","Taste of Ginger and habanero stands out, and its great. You can not taste much of mango. Instead you taste lot of sugar...that's my only complain. I use it as chutney for parathas (indian flatbread), pakodas (indian dumplings), and for making salad dressings. For me, its too sweet to be used with meats."
4,Delicious!,"We used this sauce on grilled tilapia and chicken and it was delicious. Slightly sweet, slightly spicy with a kick from the ginger that gave it an Asian quality. Recommended!"
4,"too sweet, not spicy enough",This habanero sauce has a nice flavour. It leans toward the sweet-side. I was hoping for something spicier.
3,good- but mild,"I like this product- it's low in calories and all-natural. You know what the things are that are on the ingredient label.The taste is slightly sweet with just a hint of spice that comes across very gradually. My only issue is that it's a very mild flavor. When cooking, it's hard to bring that flavor out. It even gets lost in chicken- so be generous when cooking with it.Otherwise, a good product. Very yummy!"
4,An opinion from a Lowbrow,"The combination of meat plus a sweet sauce has always been a winner with me. That's what this sauce is. Far more sweet than hot, Fischer & Wieser Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce reminds most of sweet and sour sauce.I'm no great chef, so I'm lacking the appreciation that this sauce deserves. I just dunked my pork chops in it. It's good, I like it.My friends who tried it shrugged their approval, but no one's racing to the 'fridge to use up the rest of the bottle.If you're like me, try it. You can't use ketchup every time."
3,OK but nothing special,"I tried this on chicken, fish, rice and it's OK. While I like ginger I found this way too gingery, that is by far the strongest flavor. It is very much like a doctored up duck sauce. It is sweet and mildly spicy but I found it lacked any high note zing which left it kind of flat. It needed a bit of an acid for the missing element maybe some rice wine vinegar or lemon juice. I didn't dislike it but I didn't love it either. I much prefer Island Grove, Jamaican Hot sauce, it is also Mango Hab. also sweet and not very hot but the curry element adds a very nice finish rather then the ginger.If you love duck sauce imagine it with a tiny bit of heat and tons of ginger thats what you've pretty much got with this product. Would probably be great on egg rolls."
2,A Strange Combination of Flavors,"The ingredients of this sauce sound interesting -- mango, ginger, and habanero peppers. The problem is that the sauce is terribly sweet. The mango puree, honey, and sugar contribute too much sweetness which is not offset enough by the peppers. The ginger flavor is virtually lost. We tried the sauce on chicken and the sauce overpowered it, almost completely masking the chicken's flavor. We figured it would devastate fish, so we never tried it on fish. Of course, foods are a matter of individual taste, so if you tend to prefer sweetness in cooked foods, you might enjoy this sauce. However, if your want a sauce to accent rather than dominate a main course, look elsewhere. This one isn't for you."
3,"Pretty good, but a little weird tasting.","This is a sweet-and-sour sauce, and it's fairly spicy for that kind of sauce. That's okay though, the extra spice adds some extra excitement to whatever you put it on. The only thing I don't like is that it's got a bit too much of one spice in it. It's the type of thing that if you made it yourself, you'd curl up your lips and say ""Whoops, we put too much of THAT in."" I don't know which spice it is, ginger maybe? I'm not big on spices, however I don't really mind them if they're fitting for the dish. This one just goes a bit overboard.I imagine this would be really good on egg rolls and that sort of thing, I tried it on plain chicken and although it was pretty good, I can't give it more than 3/5 stars because of the excess of that oddball spice."
3,"Mango Si, Sugar No!","The flavor of the mango was excellent and I would have given this sauce 5 stars for that but I had to dock it two stars for the following reasons:1) Overly sweetened (probably good as an ice-cream topping though)2) Not spicey enough for something labeled 'ginger-habanero'We had some with leg of lamb and it went fairly well, but would have been better with less sugar and more zest. If your taste runs to sweet sauces which are not very spicey then add back stars as appropriate!"
4,Very good hot-sweet sauce,"We have now used nearly the entire bottle of this sauce, which we have used both for cooking and as a side ""dipping"" sauce. The mango and ginger combination is well designed, neither too sweet nor overwhelmed with spices, with some complexity in the flavor from the other components.""Hot"" is of course a relative term; I consider this sauce, despite its habanero content, to be of at best medium heat. The heat has a slight ""build"" in it, but it's flavorful and warm rather than sharp or biting. I would recommend this sauce to anyone who likes sweet-hot sauces. It goes well with all types of food (on which you'd put hot sauce), including heavier meats like beef, poultry, and even fish and vegetables. It's not quite the best sweet-hot tropical sauce I've had, but it's good."
2,Sauce that is okay for doctoring up,"I am a foodie. So, any sauce has to really impress me. The name sounds good, like a unique flavor has been discovered. Unfortunately, the sauce is overly sweet, the mango lost in the sweetness and the ginger is almost indiscernible in the mess of flavors. Turns out, if you add a bunch of flavors and mix them all up, it tastes like ...a mix of flavors that totally neutralizes any nuances. You can easily make a sauce like this, a sweet/hot sauce, and there are plenty out there that are good straight from the bottle instead of wanting to grab the spice rack to ""fix"" this sauce. Not terrible, but not very good, either."
4,Hot it's not...,"I bought this from the manufacturer. It's a spicy-ish, but not hot. Actually the flavor is good though it's a tad sweeter than I would prefer and a lot less hot than I would prefer. I used it on chicken, cooked my chicken and then brushed this sauce on it and put it under the broiler for a minute or two until the top of the chicken with the sauce on it browns a bit. Very good. I also think it would make a great dipping sauce. I would not like it with beef, but I think it might work really well on pork chops. If you don't like somewhat sweet sauces, this is not for you because it is sweet. It would be even better if it had a real habanero kick to it!"
3,"Pleasantly spicy and sweet, but nothing spectacular.","This mango-ginger sauce is a low-key, pleasantly spicy and sweet sauce that works well with vegetables. I haven't tried it on meat yet.It doesn't pack much of a punch, which means I didn't care for it particularly.However, for spice-averse guests and family members, this would be perfect. As I said, it is just 'pleasantly' sweet and spicy, so while there's nothing particularly bad about this sauce, there isn't anything particularly good, either. I'm almost finished my bottle, and would recommend this to something looking to add a dash of easy sweetness and mild spice. It also might be a nice way to wake up meats that have been overcooked."
4,I was pleasantly surprised.,"I am personally so sick of mango and the fact that it is still a trendy fruit makes me crazy. However, we tried this recently after letting it sit in the refrigerator for a couple of months unopened. My girlfriend thought it would be great but I never relented because it just sounded terrible to me.I could not have been more wrong. When her sister came over for dinner they broke it out despite my pleas to the contrary and used it on the barbecued chicken. It was really, really good. I'm such a baby about trying new things especially when they are made with ingredients I typically do not like but this was really a pleasant surprise. I won't say I'll use it all the time but I won't protest if she makes chicken with it again."
3,Label a little deceiving (not habanero hot),"I tried this marinade with some chicken for the grill and after following the directions and grilling the meat, I was a little disappointed with the marinade. There was such a lack of heat that I feel the labeling is a little misleading. Don't get me wrong, there is some heat, but for those that are specifically looking for ""habanero"" products know what you are in for and this lacks. For my taste, there is too much mango and ginger and too little habanero. I even tasted the marinade from the jar and it reminds me of a spicy sweet and sour sauce.Decent flavor, but much more sweet and tangy than hot."
4,"Could be hotter, but it's still yummy.","My husband and I adore spicy food. We are really into the HOT, HOT kind. Unforunately this product doesn't deliver the kick that we were both looking for. If you're interested in a mildly spicy sauce that does have a TON of flavor, I'd recommend it, but for spice-lovers such as ourselves, I'd pass on it."
4,Quite Tastey,"This item worked very well for grilling, not as well as for dipping. It is tangy, not sweet, and works best for chicken and pork-especially pork tenderloin. It made it very moist and tender and it gave it a very smokey great flavor. It didn't taste as good if you grilled the item first and then used this as a dipping sauce-so this is much better for grilling. Would recommend for a change of pace."
3,could be better. a lot better.,"Tastes mostly of ginger, honey, and mango, which is not a bad combination. There's a hint of heat from the habanero, which is a welcome addition, but is barely perceivable.The sauce is a bit too sweet. The mango would have been sufficiently sweet without the addition of honey. As another reviewer mentioned, this would make an excellent ice-cream topping on a hot summer day. Would also make an effective glaze for lamb and pork.Also suggested by another reviewer, this may make a good foundation for a more complex and versatile sauce. I'd start with a little more salt. Actually, some sriracha would add both heat and salt, which would round out the flavor profile some more. Or try adding chipotle/adobo for heat, salt, and smokey flavor to make an interesting barbecue sauce.It's sweet enough, and fruity enough, that it makes a pretty good spread for toast! No really! It's great."
3,Certainly Ginger,"I didn't find this very sweet or spicy, just a strong ginger taste. As a marinade or mix with other sauces, this can add a unique flavor, but as a stand alone sauce the ginger taste is overwhelming. If you really like ginger, this might be a good fit, but I found it too strong a taste to be good as an accompaniment to an entree. I tried it with chicken and beef, and it worked much better as a pre-cooking sauce on the beef than on anything else."
1,;0(,Did not like the taste at all. I love mango but something was not jelling for me with the taste.
4,Unique Taste,"This is a pretty daring mix of Mango, Ginger and fiery Habaneros. The latter is probably the hottest of all Chili's but in this blend the heat level is tolerable and well balanced with the taste of Ginger & Mango.I found the taste more interesting every time I tried it, it definitely grew on me.We tried it as a dip and then found it worked as a great side to my favorite Indian (style) curries such as Madras, Vindaloo and Biryani's.Mango Chutney is a great side with curries and this works a treat too!My family of four had a generally favorable opinion, only my 12 year old daughter said it did not appeal to her.I finished of the remaining sauce with Tortilla Chips while watching a movie and still wanted more!If you want something that will give your taste buds a nice surprising tingle, give it a try. it gets my approval!"
5,Fischer & Wieser Score a Perfect 5!,"The Fischer & Wieser Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce is absolutely wonderful. The sauces ginger flavor is subtle and sweet with the habanero peppers adding a brilliant flavor and gentle hint of heat that lingers on but never overpowers your culinary dishes.This sauce is good on everything from chicken to fish and at only 50 calories per serving you're not breaking your diet every time you use it.It is extremely versatile and works great on the barbeque, as a marinade, or straight out of the bottle. You can even use it to make a lovely vinaigrette salad dressing to kick your salads up a notch.This sauce is something you and your family are sure to enjoy - mine certainly did!I also recommend Fischer & Wieser's Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce which is equally as good but has a sweeter flavor."
3,Pretty weird.,"I'm big fan of exotic ingredient sauces, etc.... This sauce is a Mango Ginger Habanero sauce. Where's the habanero? Upon further scrutiny of the ingredients, I found that it has more sugary components than not.SugarHoneyApple CiderMangoGingerHabaneroMan, no wonder it has no kick to it. It's a sugar sauce.It gets a 3 star, because it does taste good on cooked meats, but fails as a dipping sauce. The label even says that it can be used for dipping, but forget that noise."
4,Delicious,"I made shish kabobs last night on the grill using the Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce...delicious! Bacon-wrapped chicken, steak, shrimp, fish, bell pepper, onion, pineapple, and squash with some cayenne pepper sprinkled over it (I LOVE IT SPICY) all basted with the Habanero Sauce. Put the shish kabobs on a bed of rice, serve with ice cold beer and it's a party! Cheers!"
5,Mango Habanero Sauce,"This sauce is the only way to go when baking salmon. I used it when I cooked salmon for 100 guests at my nephew's wedding. I used to be able to buy it at Costco and they quit carrying it. It's sweet and spicy and even people that don't like salmon like it when cooked with this sauce. Pam from Aurora, CO"
4,Tastes Good. Nice and Hot!,This has a great flavor and is a premium product. It better be for the price. It was a little on the sweet side for me but not enough to detract from the nice mix of flavors. I like the heat it had although I would also prefer that it be brought down a notch. It works great on chicken. Unfortunately I am the only one in my family that likes hot spices so I have to make a little at a time. It seems to keep well between uses after you have opened it though.
4,Tasty - with a bit of heat,"As a marinade or dipping sauce, this sauce was a little sweet for my liking when used straight. Its flavor more closely resembles a chutney. It is tasty, though, and I highly recommend drizzling it over a puff pastry-wrapped brie. Delicious! And there's just enough spice to make it interesting.If you do want to use it as a marinade, I suggest adding it to beer or soy sauce to curb the sweetness a bit. In a slightly more savory blend, it would be terrific on chicken or salmon."
2,Not the greatest,"I received this sauce from the Vine program. I used it to glaze some chicken, and tasted it on a teaspoon as well. The sause did not have a very lpeasant taste by itself, almost soapy. I thought that possibly cooking it on something would help to enhance the sweetness of it, and I was incorrect. It still tasted soapy, only hotter.The sauce does have a very nice bite to it from the habanero, but the ginger tastes overpowering and really manipulates the flavor too much."
5,Too Sweet but good,"I try the sauce whit cream cheese and wheat crackers and I like it, the taste is good but is too sweet maybe with something more salty will taste better."
5,Great for cooking or dipping!,"The Mango Habanero Sauce is sort of like sweet-and-sour sauce or orange sauce, except that it's quite delicious.You can definitely taste the mango and ginger in the sauce. I thought the ginger was a bit stronger, but others thought the mango was more prominent. It works as an excellent dipping sauce for things that you might normally pair with sweet-and-sour sauce or even some sweeter salsas.Overall, I would recommend this sauce, but if you don't like ginger, you might find it a bit too strong. The sauce works great for dipping or for mixing into other foods to give a bit of a kick."
4,"Whoa hot, but ooooh so yummy","This stuff is quite simply delicious - every part of the flavor can be tasted - nice sweet mango, decently strong ginger and the kick from the habaneros. This ain't Ketchup, so dip carefully.As soon as you feel the bite from the habanero, you feel the cooling from the ginger. I've tried the stuff with everything from tacos to chicken, and it is extremely versatile. A real winner, and something I recommend everyone tries!"
3,Great tasting sauce but a little weak....,"The sweet mango flavor of this sauce comes through magnificently, though the ginger and habaneros are pretty much lost. It simply doesn't compare in taste intensity with their flagshipFischer & Wieser Razzpotle Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce, 20-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)sauce.This sauce claims ""Sweet Heat,"" but I really can't detect much heat at all -- if they put 1/2 habanero in this whole bottle, I'd be surprised.Really tastes great, but after marinating (with half a bottle) and then cooking an eye of round, I couldn't taste the sauce at all. It served well as a dipping sauce, but again, you really had to ladle the stuff on.Again, great flavor, but I'd go with their Razzpotle sauce over this one any day: it truly has the ""sweet heat"" balance down right. WONDERFUL stuff."
3,Another Sweetie,"This is the second Fischer & Wieser product I've tried, the first being their overly sweet, jam-like, cloying raspberry chipotle sauce. That tasted more like pancake syrup than a sauce.But since I like trying different sauces I sent for the mango ginger habanero sauce. This, too, is overly sweet but not as bad as the raspberry. I read several reviews saying that there's a lot of heat in this sauce that sneaks up on you as you eat it, but for me it stayed completely hidden and never made an appearance. It was mildly spicy but that's about it. Let's put it this way - it is too spicy for babies to eat.So why three stars? It has a nice taste to it and I do like how the habanero prevents it from being overwhelmingly sweet. But nevertheless it is still sweet and for me, I can only eat so much of it before it gets tiring. I think this would be best used as a light marinade on grilled meats - just enough to give the meat flavor but not overpower it."
3,swing and a miss,"While not bad it is sub-labled ""Sweet Heat""; and for my tastes it is much too sweet and not nearly enough heat. Most of the other reviews have covered the main points; I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it but with chicken strips or something like that I would use it. The consistency is like a mango preserve or chutney; a few nice flavors but with harbanero in the label I was disappointed."
4,"Hot, tangy, sweet & fruity!","Fischer & Weiser Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce is quite hot and spicy. It goes great with fish and chicken - either grilled, broiled, or fried. It must be refrigerated after opening. If you don't like hot foods, this definitely isn't for you. Also, it is very sweet. The sauce contains mango and ginger for a fruity, spicy accent along with habanero peppers. There are 50 calories per tablespoon. Very good if you like your sauce hot and sweet."
5,Great Sauces,"Mango Ginger Habanero is the third flavor of Fischer & Wieser sauce that I've tried and it just keeps getting better and better. The Mango Ginger Habanero has a strong base of fruit flavor and sweetness and that distinctive ""bite"" of habanero. The ginger is more in the background and adds a great Asian note to the sauce. I like my food spicy and for me the heat in this sauce is on the milder side, but if you aren't used to a-lot of heat you may find this on the ""hot"" side. We slow roasted a Boston butt and then pulled the meat. We then tossed the hot pork in the sauce......Great!"
4,Sweet honey-like flavor with a wonderful mild burn; yummy with chicken,"By itself, the F&W; Mango Ginger Habanero sauce tastes a lot like a mildy spicy honey sauce. The flavors are mild but tasty. But when used on meat, the flavors really come alive. I've enjoyed this sauce on chicken especially.What really makes this sauce stand out is the mild habanero burn that take a few seconds to hit; it is simply wonderful. Not too much, not too little. Not too much to overwhelm, yet not too little that its overlooked or boring. A surprise for the mild kind of sauce that it is.I'm usually not a fan of sweet sauces - I like spicy punchy sauces - but this one is worth keeping, especially for those days when I'm not up to the heat but still want the burn.Worth trying."
3,"Rather sweet, but okay for occassional use","I have tried the Mango Ginger Habanero sauce on chicken and pork and it goes well with either one. It was also excellent as an appetizer drizzled over a block of cream cheese served with crackers. I think the prominence of flavors matches the title - first you get a hit of mango, then strong ginger, then a follow-up hit of spicy hot. I only wish that the second and third ingredients were not sugar and honey. It would be much better if it were less sweet in my opinion. And ""hot"" is so relative, but I like pretty spicy foods and did not find this quite hot enough, but I could definitely taste it. I will use this occasionally, but the flavors are very strong and I would get very tired of it if used very often."
2,Too dialed down,"I had high expectations of something called ""Mango Ginger Habanero"" sauce and was more than a bit let down after trying this sauce on grilled chicken. This is three of my favorite flavors rolled into one so my anticipation was high. Instead, it just very sweet taste that reminded me of something I'd dip chicken fingers from a chinese restaurant in versus the expected caribbean zing I was looking forward to. I just didn't expect a duck sauce knock-off. Where was the kick? Habanero is supposed to be hot! I got little mango from this, no ginger and very little heat at all. I was definitely left wanting a more intense flavor and kick."
1,Annoying Sweet,"It sounded like it would be a hit...a combination of Mango, Ginger, and Habanero sauce which all three are my favorites...but this product taste anything but annoying sweet. Mango is already a sweet fruit but Fischer and Wieser added more sugar so its no longer just sweet but super annoying sweet. Too sweet is not necessarily a good thing and when I tried it as a dipping sauce or on top of salads...I was not too pleased."
2,Didn't like it... Like HOT flower-sauce,"I wanted to like Ginger Habanero Sauce but I found the taste of this sauce very cloying. At first I thought it was not hot at all... But then the habanero kicked in and my tastebuds were on fire.The overall effect was like eating a mouthful of what you'd expect flowers to taste like mixed with habanero. I might've liked it better if it were more mild, but I need to keep my stomach lining as happy as possible.2 stars. Not my favorite sauce."
4,Extremely Sweet,"I've used this sauce with rice and with scrambled eggs. In both cases the taste is excellent but extremely sweet. Certainly this is an enjoyable product, but all that sugar can't be real healthy. I was expecting some spice from the habanero (which I normally love) but the sweet sugar overwhelms the habanero."
3,A very good (but not great) sauce,"I've tried Fischer & Wieser's raspberry-chipotle sauce and loved it so I thought I'd try this, too. I like it, but not as much.There isn't a very strong flavor here. The habaneros and the mangoes don't jump out at you. The ginger is present, but mainly in the subtle bite that ginger brings.I've tried this with chicken breasts and with fried chicken ""chunks."" It makes a good dipping sauce, kind of an upscale sweet 'n' sour sauce.Try it if you're looking for a vaguely Asian sauce with just a little bite. Otherwise, I'd recommend you try the raspberry-chipotle first."
3,"Ginger, I taste that...","This sauce may disappoint a bit at first. It does taste of ginger, but habanero? Only in the distance. It's there, but only as a hint of flavor. It's very sweet, and you realize why when you see some of the ingredients: Mango Puree, Sugar, Honey, Apple Cider.The sauce consistency and color are closer to runny jelly than a dipping sauce. Perhaps some will enjoy dipping, it wasn't for me. The consistency is wrong and the sweetness is a bit much.I was about to give up, but then I discovered this sauce actually works better as a glaze on chicken. There, the sauce seems to do better; the sugar isn't as sweet and it's a quick way to add some interest to some chicken you cook on the grill.If you like sweet sauces this is for you. Otherwise, you might look for something with a bit more bite to it."
2,This sweet heat sauce is somewhat sweeter,"This ""sweet heat"" mango sauce with a touch of Habanero peppers is somewhat thick and viscous that contains more mangos than Habanero. Hence I found this a little sweeter than the hot sauce I am used to. I tried this on grilled chicken sandwich, and baked fish sandwich; it tasted good, but you may want to add other condiments to spice it up depending upon your taste. If you use this while grilling or baking it tastes better than adding after grilling/baking. I tried this sauce also on Chinese food and it works well.1.El Yucateco Green Habanero Sauce, 8 oz.2.El Yucateco Extra Hot Habanero Sauce, 4 oz.3.Pickapeppa Hot Mango Sauce4.Earth & Vine Mango Horseradish Seafood Sauce & Dip5.Pomegranate & Mango Chipotle Sauce (15.75 ounce) by [..]"
4,Superb Sauce for the Broiler!,"Many sauces similar to this one are basically flavored corn syrup, so it's nice to see a company using cane sugar to sweeten their product. Real sugar goes a long way not only in flavor, but how the sauce holds up as a finishing glaze in the oven or broiler. Deliciously sweet with notes of mango, honey and fresh ginger with a pronounced dry, spicy habanero pepper kick on the finish. The heat stays with you, but its not super spicy, so you don't have to be super adventurous to enjoy it. As a dipping sauce, it is simply too sweet and flavorful and will likely overpower whatever you're dipping in it, so it definitely works better as a finishing sauce than a dip. It might work when used with Asian inspired egg rolls. It's great with chicken or pork. Try it on baby back ribs instead of BBQ sauce... absolutely delightful! The cane sugar caramelizes under the heat of the broiler creating a delicious sweet and spicy glaze that is simply superb with pork. Recommended."
5,Great stuff!!!,"Absolutely delicious but a little on the pricey side as sauces go. Great on chicken, pork eggrolls. Use as a sweet and sour sauce kicked up a notch."
2,"Sweet Sweet sauce with subtle mango,ginger & habanero taste. This not a sweet heat sauce just very very sweet sauce.","Do not be fooled by the name. I could not taste the ginger(no ginger after bite) at all and barley the habanero only after several tastes. Sauce is really way too sweet(too much honey for me), but makes a good honey glazed chicken for the kids. This is a dipping-finishing sauce so is supposed to be used after food is prepared."
2,Too sweet,"I suppose this would make a good dip for chicken wings or other fried things, but it is far too sweet to use as a marinade or glaze. Not too hot, though, so don't get scared by the habanero in the name. The flavor is good, but because it is so sweet, I'm unsure what to use this with. Not the steak or pork chop sauce I thought it might be."
4,A great blend of flavours,"I've used this sauce for two dishes, first a marinade for braised chicken breasts, secondly in place of a mango chutney for a curry. The ginger adds a really great taste to this dip, goes well with papadums and with chicken and rice. For braised chicken marinating with a lemon squeezed in makes for a savoury dish that goes well by itself or served with rice. The heat is not overpowerful and will be enjoyed by those not that into spicy foods as well. For those who like a little more heat a few drops of your typical scotch bonnet sauce will bring the heat up to par. It's an easy four stars for this dip."
2,Better than naked chicken: barely.,"I used this sauce for dipping chicken and found it rather uninteresting. The primary tastes are ginger and honey; surprisingly there was no mango taste despite mango being the first ingredient on the label (the next two were sweeteners). In fact, I would say that ""sweet"" is the main taste. The heat is comparable to the bottom of the medium-range in salsa. The sauce is about the consistency of imitation maple syrup. It was better than eating the chicken straight, but not by much."
2,Very sweet and not spicy at all,"Personally, I found this too sweet for my taste. The sweetness was the level I would expect from a dessert topping. Not that this is not without its uses. I think that this would make a perfect topping for my waffles, which I am going to try. The habanero is misleading. I detected no heat level at all. It is very similar to a spiced pineapple topping I once tried over ice cream."
3,"Interesting taste, just not for me","Let's go through the main ingredients again - Mango, Ginger, Habaneros - now close your eyes and visualize the taste.<cue in loud sound so you can read the next part> Now open your eyes and taste this sauce - yeup, it probably tastes exactly as you imagined. Quite an interesting combination - it is absolutely great on chicken, but not the best combo for beef or seafood (I only tried it on salmon).Would I buy this in the store ? (remember, I'm a Vine reviewer and received this product to review for free) No, probably not, but if you want that secret ingredient/sauce that no one can quite put their finger on, but will say, man, that's some great tasting chicken - what's your secret recipe - well I think this is it. I give it 3 stars because the taste is a bit too unique and is really only great with chicken."
4,"Delicious, but not very spicy","This sauce is delicious, but you would think it would be quite hot and spicy, seeing as it has 'habañero' in the name. Habañero peppers are extremely hot and you would think that would be the point of having the word in the name of the sauce, it likely being meant to tell people that this sauce is quite hot, but no; instead, the sauce has a very mild flavor of chili pepper - that's it. Apparently, there is some actual 'habañero' pepper somewhere in the ingredients, but it's toward the end of the list, so evidently, not much. Anyway, the sauce is still quite delicious, just not exactly what one might expect."
3,Too sweet,This sauce tastes like many others I've had with this sweet hot combination. I prefer more hot and way less sweet.
4,"Sweet, subtle, and gluten free!","Having celiac disease, I get really excited when I find a new gluten free product. The Fischer and Weiser website has a gluten free list which I really appreciate. They also have a nice library of recipes for using their products, even a dessert called Coconut Mango Ginger Habanero Dessert, which is like a layered pudding made using the Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce. Sounds interesting!If you're looking for a sauce to wow you, this hasn't got the flavor or the heat. What it is though, is a sweet, smooth sauce with a mild heat...it just gives your food a little extra something. I agree with the other reviews that the ginger is barely detectable, and the mango doesn't have a strong presence either. It's not bad at all, it's just not going to knock your socks off. If you want a sauce with a little more kick, try their Razzpotle. We enjoyed it as well."
4,"Emphasize the ""sweet"" part of sweet heat","Heat junkies may be disappointed to find that the ""sweet"" part of ""sweet heat"" comes out on top, but that's no reason to pass this by. We tried it on grilled chicken and strips of steak. Both were nice and bright and tasty (though I vastly preferred the chicken over the steak). Too bad it's still too chilly to grill outside, because I suspect this would go great on some wings and with a few beers. Can't wait to try it this summer.But no, not much in the way of heat. Barely anything, really. Those with a limited palate may find it spicy, but I found the kick to be relatively mild. Good taste, no jolt. So if you're looking for a nice twist on something with bite, look again. You won't find it here. This is good stuff, but ""sweet heat""? Nah. Just a nice, tangy but mild habanero."
3,"Very different, but not bad!","I ordered this because my son likes to try new interesting flavors, so I thought why not? When it arrived it was a light orange color and was full of seeds...sort of odd. He actually put it in some hearty soup he had just made, or put it on top of it and he liked it. It has a tangy flavor,smokey a bit spicey but he enjoyed it. it does have an odd texture."
2,Couldn't Taste the Habanero at All,"As a fan of spicy foods, I was anxious to try out this sauce. The habanero is one of my favorite peppers, adding great flavor and heat. Unfortunately, this product diluted the habanero taste so that it wasn't significant at all.I tried this sauce as a cooking glaze and a dip with beef, chicken, and pork. If you're looking for sweetness, it adds a very pleasant flavor. Unfortunately, that's not what I'm looking for in a sauce that boasts habanero. The mango, honey, and apple flavors dominate this sauce. The ginger is also apparent, but not as pronounced. The poor, poor habanero is absolutely lost in the shuffle.Overall, this sauce is a pretty big disappointment to me. If it were advertised and marketed as a fruity sauce, I'd be much happier with the product. The company advertises this product as having ""sweet heat"". Well, it got half of it right."
2,This is No Raspberry Chipotle Sauce,"I gave this stuff a try after I fell in love with the Fischer & Wieser Raspberry Chipotle Sauce, which I mixed with olive oil to make into salad dressing. This Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce is nothing special in my book, for several reasons. First, it is much TOO SPICY for my wimpy taste buds. The Raspberry Chipotle had some bite, but I could handle it. Not this stuff. Second, the flavor combination here doesn't knock me off my feet, like the Raspberry Chipotle variety. The mango and ginger flavors are quite strong, and not complementary, in my opinion. Third, this sauce is not as versatile as the Raspberry Chipotle Sauce. I expected that I would be able to make it into salad dressing, but the bottle had no such suggestions, as with the Raspberry Chipotle. It seems to be good for fewer types of uses. Anyway, it was worth a try, and it was not horrible. My expectations were just too high after trying their Raspberry Chipotle Sauce."
3,Sweet but no Spicy,I was really looking forward to tasting the spiciness in this sauce but instead just tasted the sweet. There was no heat at all. The name is kind of misleading but besides that it tasted very good. Very good as a dipping sauce for those chicken tender strips.
2,Okay Sauce - Not much flavor,"I was very excited to receive the Mango Ginger Habanero sauce, as I LOVE the Roasted Raspberry Chipotle by Fischer & Wieser. This sauce was a big disappointment. The sauce is too sweet with only a little flavor and a small amount of heat. The raspberry chipotle is bursting with flavors, so I was expecting much more from the mango ginger. I do not plan to buy this sauce in the future."
2,Can't taste the mango nor habanero. Too sweet from the honey.,"I was quite impressed by Fischer & Weiser's Raspberry Chipotle sauce and had high expectations for the Mango Ginger Habanero flavor. While I really enjoyed the texture and complexity of the Raspberry Chiptole, I find this one to be sort of boring.Much of the essence of a fresh ripe mango is lost upon bottling. While I can taste a hint of (cooked) mango, it is overpowered by the sweetness and flavor of honey. They should have named it Honey Ginger Spicy Sauce. I can taste a good amount of ginger in the middle of my palate, which then gives way to a moderate level of heat from the habanero. While the heat is present, I can't actually taste the unique bright flavor of habaneros in the sauce.The texture is thick and syrupy. It kind of looks like the nasty brown sauce they use in the neighborhood Chinese-American restaurants. Like it's been thickened with a ton of cornstarch."
1,Bleh.,"This sauce was sweeter than I thought it should be with not much exciting flavor. Sort of like the duck sauce that comes in packets at the Chinese takeout, but with some peppery heat mixed in. I detected very little in the way of mango, and the ginger taste was missing too.We tried it with some grilled chicken. Perhaps some egg rolls might have been a better pairing.Normally I like sweetness in a dipping sauce, but it must have flavor behind it, else it risks being rather insipid, like this. Would not purchase again."
4,Christmas Reflections: A Marty WNED Favorite,"Judith Lynn Stillman's Christmas Reflections is an important part of my holiday rotation on my radio show. These well-crafted arrangements of traditional tunes vary from quiet and reflective, to upbeat and bright. The recorded quality itself is what we call ""hot"" in the biz, so keep the volume low enough to avoid distortion and harshness. My listeners enjoy this CD. I do too."
1,Worst. Cheapest. Dollar Store Quality,"This is the cheapest piece of junk I've ever seen. NOT real leather. Not even a decent quality plastic. Don't bother. You get what you pay for. You'd find better quality at a dollar store. With postage added to this, it was a waste of around $8.00."
2,The Boring Book,The Scarlet Letter was assigned reading in my English class. I found that the best way to understand the book was to read it aloud. The Cliff Notes did not help me on the quiz. They are completely plot summary. I was able to use Monarch notes since they provided much more detail
1,These were awful,These book notes were awful-They didn't give suffice information of the plot of the book-Don't buy them! Just read the book or go to Barron's!
1,This Book Is Truely A Waste Of My Time,This book is really boring. I don't recomend it to anyone. I'm sorry if you had to read it. I feel your pain.
1,I think they could have been more descriptive.,it was lackin detail and really didnt help me as much as i wanted. overall was not worth the money i paid for them.
2,Ugh,"Had to read it for school, hard to muddle through. Suggestion: skip the commentary, just read the dialogue, and you'll get the gist. The cliff notes sure helped."
1,This is the most boring book I have ever read,Hawthorne uses entirely too much imagery.There is supposed to be some deeper meaning but it is hidden so well I'll never find it until after I flunk my Literature test and the teacher explains it.
1,One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read,"This book is so full of symbolism that is very difficult to understand. I mean, every line in the book is underlined for importance for my English class. And Hawthorne inserts so many small details and bits of factual information which are symbolic to other events that I failed the final test on the book. It is such a very badly written, difficult to read, unlikeable, and streatched-out navel that I don't understand how anyone could enjoy reading it."
4,Good and intriging,Personally I think the was great. It explained how life was in the early times and it is similar to how life is now. Maybe if it was still used today society would be more faithful. The book kept me reading to see what would happen next.
2,It was completely off base from the actual happenings,"I liked the story, but the fact that it was completely different from the real story turned me away from liking it. Hawethorne changed so many aspects of the characters that shouldn't have been changed"
1,Skip It at All Costs,"This was a horrible book. The plot was so simplistic and uneventful that I would ahve preferred to have read a simple one-paragraph summary, because that is all the more description this boring story needs to fully develop. This story would have made an interesting little legend, but by no means was it an interesting novel. The characters were plastic and fake, the plot was almost worthwhile but for being overdeveloped, drawn out, and dry. The moral is touching, but it's not worth suffering through the novel for. If this is a required read, I reccomend the Cliff's Notes or other study guides. Don't read this book if you don't have to."
4,"Great book, for those of us who understood it!","I thought that this book was very interesting if you understood the true intentions of it. People tend to view it as a boring book, because the dialouge of the book is out-dated, and the plot may not be what most people can hope for. But if you look at it from a literary perspective then the book becomes very fascinating!"
5,Come on people!,"After reading some of these reviews, quite frankly, I am shocked. The Scarlet Letter is 5-star worthy, and then some. Hawthorne proves his brilliance through his astounding use of chiaroscuro and deus ex machina (Pearl). He also shares similar characteristics to Rembrandt, in that he is not so much concerned with reality as he is with inner feelings and understanding. The Scarlet Letter is one of America's first literary masterpieces, and should be required in every American literature class in the country."
3,The Scarlet Letter,This book was intereting in a different way. As a high school student I found it difficult to understand. It required a great deal of thought. I think this book helped many of us students appreciate the knowledge of our English teacher!
2,I wish the book had never been written,"Although it is an interesting plot and setting, the story is hard to appreciate due to the aristocratic jargon and forced elaboration. I would have never read the book if it had not been an assignment in class. I liked the story and the moral behind it, but Hawthorne could have made the book more concise; and because of his long, drawn out descriptions, he makes the story line hard to follow and understand. Some authors are adapt and quite good at descriptive detail that only enhances the book, but he is obviously not."
1,Failed after 2 years...,"Great drive with no problems, but I apparently lacks manufacturing quality. I have used this drive for a little more than 2 years as a primary drive. Last weeks it just failed. This was a major hassle because I had my operating system installed on it. My second drive that came with my computer (Gateway) still works after four years. I won't buy Maxtor drives again."
1,I'm Talking Night-Court-in-it's-Fifth-Season Lame,"I would think that the music of Korn to date would provide rich material for some great remixes, tributes, etc. Yet, here we have yet another surprisingly bad Korn tribute album. Unimaginative covers performed by singers and musicians with remarkably less talent than the group itself."
1,disgrace to the name Korn...,"This is all techno... bad techno... even tho I'm someone who likes most techno, I really do not like this CD. It isn't remixes or anything, it's basically just techno songs that bare a resemblance to some of Korn's songs. The tracks by dogooder are especially bad. They are some of the worst songs I have EVER heard! They sing ""Let's get this party started"" (which happens to be one of my favorite Korn songs) and they butchered it! They are off key, and too mellow. Even though I think Korn deserves a tribute more than almost any band ever, this is basically just some really bad ""musicians"" who decided they wanted to try to leach off of Korn's fame."
1,BOO!! I HATED THIS CD,"This CD was something that I greatly regreted buying! It is full of a bunch of eleectronic computer generated sound FX for people who really don't like true ROCK. They add a lot of different types of really annoying sounds, and the people singing the songs do not have very good voices at all. Korn has their own unique way of singing and playing their instruments that many people including my self enjoy very much, this tribute album however does not justify Korn's music at all. I feal that Korn would be ashamed to have such a bad tribute to them on the Shelves. I did not like this CD one bit, and I would only recommend it to people who do not like KORN or their type of music at all."
2,Not close enough,"I felt as if this title was lacking the emotions and furosiousness that Jonathen puts in his lyrics. Its just not the same for Korn fans World Wide, But if your into the Groove bit, then have at it. This will do you some good. But me personally, Im glad I only Burned the thing, and didnt spend money on it. So beware all true Korn fans, though this music may be the same words as the previously done, it is nothing compared to the original stuff."
3,This book isnt to bad Im reading at school.,Im reading this book in 9th grade and its not to bad. I like it but i dont think i would buy it.
1,The editor needs to be fired.,"I'm not even on page 50 yet and this is the 5th time you write an entire page describing a diagram that is on the NEXT PAGE. Do you expect us to flip back and forth everytime we read a line to understand what the hell you're talking about? It's not that hard to put text UNDER THE DIAGRAM THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING. Basic textbook writing skills Mr. Houston. Secondly, the overly complex examples you use to describe simple concepts do not help students in the slightest bit. Just because you know everything about the subject doesn't mean that we do. If this book wasn't testable I'd throw it out the window. Just terrible and frustrating to read."
4,Enjoyable re-read,"I first read this in about 1982, and though people complain about the writing, it fits perfectly with other fantasy fiction of the late 1970's. Granted, I didn't know anything about homosexuality at the age of 21 or so, but it gave me a gentle introduction into alternate lifestyles that still influences me. (and no, I'm not.)Good reading, but anyone who stocks it should shelve it in the adult section... not in fantasy."
3,Pretty. Made me Cry.,"I bought 'Dancers of Arun' 20 years ago for the cover art. The new cover looks a bit different now.About a troupe of Dancers and people with psychic powers.A few of the other reviewers here are upset about the sex. Personally, I have no problem with gratuitous sex and sexual orientations. You know, if you can't stretch your boundaries in Fantasy and SF, then where are ya?I first read Elizabeth as a teenager and she really influenced my whole direction in writing fantasy.I recommend 'The Sardonyx Net', another E.A.L. novel.There is another sequel to 'The Dancers of Arun' - 'The Northern Girl', though the characters don't come back for an encore."
4,Super Fast but Picky,"I give 4 stars because of it's AMAZING speed to recharge batteries. I have tested regular NiMH and pre-charged NiMH. NiMH will generate burning heat during the charge while my Sanyo pre-charged NiMH only gets warm.This charger is very picky on battery types. It will accept newer or healthier batteries. If not, it will provide a flashing red light."
4,Works great . . . but a bit noisy!,Overall: Gets the job done in a hurry! This battery charger works as described but it is rather loud for a small gadget.
4,Good charger,"This charger is fast and it does charge all batteries i have, including Sony, Panasonic and Duracell. It may have problem charging some old Nimb batteries where it red leds flashes but you can manually discharge those batteries until the empty (use them in any high drain devices) and try again. 3/4 worked for me."
4,Good and fast charger.,"I didn't give this 5 stars because it doesn't handle 240V input. The older Energizer 1 hour charger's AC adatper could take input for both 120V and 240V. The 30 minute model is a little bigger then the previous model but is still pretty small. It works as fast as it claims and the batteries get very hot. It charges each battery and does not require pairing up of batteries which is good. I wished Energizer kept the ability to handle dual input voltage. If you don't need the charger for use when travelling outside the U.S., then this charger is fine."
1,Horrible Product,"Soon after using this product (Previously I had been using an energizer travel charger) it started with a blinking red light when I inserted batteries. I thought it simply wasn't charging my batteries, but they won't charge in my travel charger now either. Little did I know it was destroying the energizer brand batteries I was putting into it. I looked this up online after it happened and found that many other people have experienced this problem. So now I'm left with a charger that destroyed batteries and 12 or 16 useless energizer rechargeable batteries that are only a few months old - what a waste. I would definitely think twice about purchasing this product or at least look around a bit more."
1,Avoid! - Battery Killer!,"I have to strongly agree - Even if it seems to work well at first, you'll eventually find that the Energizer 15-Minute Battery Charger either destroys or severly limits the usable recharge-life of your NimH batteries."
4,It's Good!,"I got this charger to support our new digital cameras.The charger I have has both an AC and a DC power cord, so you can charge while in your car, if you need to. It charges both 2200 and 2500 mHr Ni-MH batteries. The package I got had the charger, a set of batteries, and the power adapters. The model is CH15MN. It works very fast and it makes a little noise, with the fan going. It is very useful while at home and traveling."
4,Very good,The only glitch I found is the power adapter: is big and not multivoltage (only 110 V) so you need to take a converter in order to use it abroad.
1,Not Good,Used it for over an year. Will charge only selective batteries. Not even all the 4 batteries that came with it.
3,"Great, but....","I agree that this is a great charger to own. Bought it for my digital camera, there is no comparison of this product to that of traditional alkaline batteries. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is not for a deficiency of the charger itself but that of the price. I paid $29 + shipping, total cost was $37. Target has this same charger for $27 + tax."
1,Didn't even charge it's own batteries,"I tried 10 different AA batteries on this device, including the batteries that came with the package (two AAA and two AA batteries).This device only charged one AA battery, and didn't even charge the two AA batteries that came with the package. It charged the AAA batteries which came with the package, however.Neat idea. Poor quality. I'm returning this item."
1,2 out of 2 broke immediately,"My first one began malfunctioning on vacation, blinking red and not recharging. I bought a second one. The second time I went to use it, the same thing happened - it just blinks red regardless of the batteries used or whether it's plugged into the wall or the car lighter."
1,Blinking red light...solution.,"Like many other people on here, I get the very annoying blinking red light on batteries that are still good. Because of this VERY annoying problem, I can't give this charger a good review. With that being said, it does a good job WHEN it works properly. Granted, speed-charging a battery is not good for the battery's life, as many people have pointed out. But, with that being said, the batteries that are producing a blinking red light are not necessarily dead. This is the ""solution"" I've found to the problem with the flashing red light: I remove the ""faulty"" batteries from the charger and put them in a device that will produce a continuous drain on the battery (such as an old-school flashlight with an incandescent bulb) and let the batteries drain completely (overnight?). Then I put them back in the charger and they recharge like they're supposed to. It'd be easier to buy another charger, but money doesn't grow on trees. Hope this helps someone."
1,Battery killer,"This product worked well initially. After two year's ownership (with rather infrequent charging), most of my batteries are now id'd as defective (red blinking light on charger). After some research on the web, I believe the high charging rate reduces the life of the NiMHs because of overheating. Also, while it is optimized for energizer batteries, other NiMHs might not be optimally controlled and will result in significant overcharge and possibly accelerating irreversible damage on those batteries. Ultimately, you will have to decide if you want to trade a quick charge for battery life."
1,same as the rest,"sorta worked for a while..then killed most of the batteries..basically, what all the other 1 star reviews had problems with, so did i."
5,How it works..,"Hmmm.. I need new batteries..15 minutes later..Hey, I have batteries!Not noisy, quick and easy LED for determining when it's charged. Quick and easy. Highly recommended."
1,Read These Reviews Carefully,"I have this 15 minute charger and it has appeared to have killed not only older NMH Engergizer NEW batteries but also does not charge older ones that should still have life left in them. If you read the reviews carefully you will see that the glowing reports come from people who have only charged their batteries several times and yes, that was my experience too. However, over the long haul my experience has been exactly the same as all of the others who report dead cells that will charge on other slow chargers or not at all. We all want a quick charge but that may be a technical impossibility. I will certainly never buy one of these 15 minute chargers again and I really urge new buyers to beware."
5,Superb watch - Pulsar Solar 4000,"Received this watch as a birthday present, been wanting it for a while. Its a solid, well-built watch that has all the features you would expect from a watch of it's kind. Best dive watch under $500. Only thing better would have been a Rolex Submariner, maybe next year.Pros: Hefty, you can feel the quality in it's weight. The luminous marking are bright and easy to read. The watch body lies flush on my forearm.Cons: The strap is bulky, like others have commented. These is to much plastic material where the strap meets the watch making it impossible to get a tight fit, unless you have a really thick wrist. I replaced mine with a NATO strap, unbeatable durability and fit, but you could fit pretty much any 22mm strap onto it.Haven't put the watch through its laps yet, but I'll update to let you know how it performs at 100+ ft depths and after it gets beat up in the desert for a few months."
1,"If you like Portishead, don't buy this cd",This cd was a big let down...I was hoping to find some good acid jazz like Portishead or Lamb and instead got a set of cds that sound like generic disco elevator music. All the songs sound a-like and there are no good vocals on either cd.
2,Tracklist: ...nothing to get excited about,Tracking: 1 CD1. Back2back (Dorfmeister vs. Madrid DeRos Austria's Dub) - Pressure Drop2. What's Your Name (Quantic Remix) - Future Loop Foundation3.

5,Changed the way I think about international aid,"If you are a student of international conflict affairs or the development aid apparatus, you cannot do better than this book. Uvin applies his arguments mostly to Rwanda but aspects of his thought-provoking discussion extend far beyond. A must-read."
4,Another winner from Chicago Mass Choir,"CMC has definitely mastered the art of traditional gospel with a slight contemporary twist in an almost formulaic fashion.""Keep Your Mind On Jesus"" is another stellar example of this. While this may not be a perfect album, there's not a dud in the bunch and the songs range from good to great.Like most of their other collections, you'll want to listen to it again and again."
3,Not Mac Friendly,"Despite the claims (and logos) on the box, this item is not Macintosh friendly. The Mac setup/drivers disc it ships with is OS9 (hello, that was 3 years ago) only. The monitor will not work at the 1600x1200 resolution it touts without drivers that do not exist for the modern Mac. Customer support tried to shift the blame elswhere. Otherwise the product has worked fine (at lower resolution)."
2,Disappointing for 2005,"I could not get past the lack of photographs which would have depicted what the author was discussing. The book is filled with drawings, some look like the refrigerator art we all collect when our children are in elementary school. It was like reading an article discussing colors and all the pictures were in black and white. The book discusses plants and there is no photograph of the plant. There is one section in the middle with approximately 6 to 8 photographs. I wanted to see photographs of the stinging wasps and the poisonous plants. I didn't find them."
2,You get what you pay for...,You get what you pay for. Buy Evercoats cheapest filler and you will have cheap filler. It's very thick from the start and hard to spread. Clogs up sandpaper so have plenty extra sandpaper ready. Check out this and other ads carefully! They say it's a gallon but it's only 3 liters which is .8 US gallons. Sometimes you get even less then what you paid for.
4,The Conclusion,"Learn what happens to Nyroc,son of Nyra and Kludd. Learn about Gylbane, who stays true to what is right. Learn who Hamish is and the part he plays in the society of wolves.The end of the book is enjoyed best if you read all the previous books, but it is okay if you just have read The Hatchling, also by Katheryn Lasky.I really suggest you read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Outcast,"We love this series. My 10 and 12 year old still like to have family read aloud time, even though they are avid readers on their own. This series is one we've all enjoyed and can't wait until the next book is out."
5,Gardians of Ga'Hoole-Books 1-8,The Gardians Of Ga'Hoole books one through eight are the best series of books that I've ever read. And I've read ALOT of books in the last 11 years of my life. These books really touch your heart. This is my second time reading the series. I'm always trying to get my freinds into reading them. Anybody can relate to these books. I really hope that you read them.
4,A Good Book To Read.,"This is a great book to read if your a owl-lover, or a Guardian of Ga'Hoole fan. I'm now reading the ninth book, ""The First Collier"" I hoped that Kathryn could bring back her touch again. The first six books she wrote were AWESOME!"
4,"Great, although it takes a few listenings to really love.","I bought this cd after hearing one of the tracks in a store. BELLA CAIO was so haunting to me that it was the impetus to buy the cd(I'm usually not an impulse music buyer). The store that I originally heard the song in was a trendy vintage clothing store run by a drag queen. Although I think drag queens are usually excellent auteurs of music, I think there is a definite style. This should have clued me in on the album. It reminded me alot of the soundtrack for HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH (which I really loved and appreciated, but did not buy the cd of). SEX O'CLOCK is really great music, but I don't know if it's something I'll be playing alot in the future (and it was fairly expensive). It reminded me alot of a cross between ABBA and MARIANNE FAITHFUL (without her depth)."
5,Priceless,"A masterful, melodic American composer is joined with iconic performers rendering his works. There is nothing more to be said."
4,Big Room Sound,"If you like going to Sound Factory or Exit, you'll love this CD. High energy and hard beats make this long 2 CD set worth getting. This CD goes underground... if you're looking for Louie DeVito-type stuff, this isn't for you. If you are looking to let it rip at 4 am on the Factory main floor, turn it up for Peter's remix of Van Dyk's ""Out There"" or Peter's own ""Going Thru It"" and enjoy the mayhem. The CD needs to be played LOUD.... no cheesy trance here."
3,Disco D,"I got the CD in the everlong search of ""Where They At"" song, and was somewhat dissappointed, since the version of the song on the CD is not exactly what I was looking for. (Apparently the one I'm looking for is on EP 12"" inch, and is not commonly sold).Each song on the CD is somewhat short, I wish they were longer. Each song is not by itself but is mixed into the other one. Sometimes it's cool, but in my case I wanted songs by themselves, without other mixes.Disco D's voice is really cool. It'd be cool if he'd sing more often. Some songs are pretty interesting, in a raw explicit way in terms of lyrics, I'd say. That's not a CD you'd usually listen to with your mom. But overall .. it's alright if you're looking for a sampling of Disco D's music, or want to warm up a party and not offended by raw lyrics."
2,slightly helpful,"The vacuum is only minimally effective. If you need to pick up small debris, the pressure from the hose just sends in through the cloth bag. We put a knee high panty hose over the cloth bag that came with it and that helped some. The Intex Pool Surface Skimmer we purchased was much better value. It gets items off the water surface before they sink."
2,Lacks sophisticated insights,"I was truly disappointed in this book. The first section of the book had some interesting insights but the rest of the book seemed unoriginal. For me, the best part of the book was the annotated bibliography in the back so I that I knew what else is out there to read on the Hopi- because this book didn't cut it."
4,Just what I expected.,"The pendant is just as shown in the picture, I really like it and and am pleased with the quality for the price. The cord it comes on is long, lands near the breast bone, yet adjustable to about the collar bone. I am completely happy with this product."
4,Awesome,"I really liked the design for this, though I wished they looked more like wolfs. Mine arrived on time with no problems. Also the one i got was dented a little on the back but it's not noticeable when you put it on. The cord is adjustable and it can be pretty long to be honest, but that's a good thing. The pendant itself it a little smaller than a quarter, so i was a little disappointed, but that's okay. I wear this everyday and I love it."
4,Excellent sheet music!,"This sheet music book includes the songs of the first solo album of the great former lead voice of 10,000 Maniacs, Natalie Merchant. It features all the songs of the original album, arranged for piano/voice: St. Andreas Fault, Wonder, Beloved Wife, River, Carnival, I may know the world, The letter, Cowboy Romance, Jealousy, Where I go, Seven Years. The songs are not very difficult to play, alone or in a band, but contains very peculiar harmonies and melodies, and sensitive lyrics that speak of everyday life's pains and joys. This is the work of a star that sings about the lives of ordinary people: a man who loses his wife, a girl who's been betrayed, and so on. The better song of the album, in my opinion, is Where I go, that contains some wonderful acustic guitar solos and soothing lyrics. The work is very fine, and the sheet music very enjoyable."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought the (3) CD package, most are simular in nature, I do listen to them daily but not seeing any results"
3,Pass it on,It's a little weird to listen to and I don't put it on very often. I may just pass it on to the local thrift shop.
3,Not Discontinued But Brush heads Recalled and redsesigned Jan 2005,"Brush heads were apparently popping off in people's mouths while they were brushing. They were pulled from the market for a while and reintroduced with a brush head that appears to stay on much better and required a special tool to remove. I my experience the new design works quite well. I only give it 3 stars, since it seams to have much less power than the Braun/OralB line of brushes. Bristles don't seem to spin as fast and give that same ""I just went to the dentist office"" feeling that I used to get from my Braun/Oral-B. However I have the AA battery version, and I'd be interested to know if the rechargeable has more power."
3,Replacement brushheads are impossible to find,"My son loves this toothbrush also. I think the earlier revieweris correct, they must have discontinued this toothbrush. I havesearched for months for a replacement brushhead with no luck. Soif you buy this toothbrush, it will only last as long as thebrushhead, which does not make it a good buy."
3,fair for the price,not bad while it lasted. Had it for about a year until the speaker blew on it and now it sounds all garbled.
5,"""Vertigo"" = Calidad!!!","Yo tengo este disco en Cassette, desde entonces, cuando salio a la venta, obviamente que despues lo re-emplaze con la version CD, el mejor de La Ley en mi opinion, despues de este el que mas me gusta es ""Uno"", la edicion Cassete que tengo, incluye al final del disco un reprise de ""Fotofobia"", y un ""Remix"" instrumental, muy bueno! Lo recomiendo 100%."
4,Vertigo: Two thumbs up,"In their latest release, La Ley has once again combined great music with great lyrics. This CD differs from the others in that the sound is much more electronic, mixed with more synthesizers. If your are a La Ley lover, you will not be dissapointed. I recommend you listen to Guerrillero because they write about the political status in their native Chile and the hardships their people have suffered due to Augusto Pinochet. Another great track is Tanta Ciudad. Fotophobia is very futuristic. I met Beto Cuevas at the Banda Elastica's 6th Anniversary and the message he tries to convey is that music should be listened to and loved no matter what language it is in. Peace."
4,"Darker, and more poetic than ever, La Ley hits hard.","Dissapoiting for some, Vertigo is a misunderstood album. ""Fotofobia"", the first single is a masterpiece that has some electronic clash with the use of the electric guitars, but it still delivers its message accross. ""Ciclos"" is undoubtfully the best song in this album, and in my opinion one of the best songs La Ley has ever made. It explains the cycle us humans live and evolve through in this world, and the small insignificance a life means if it is wasted. Songs like ""Tanta Ciudad"" and ""Guerrillero"" are exceptionally written and composed. The mix of electronics may unattract you at first, but after listening to it 3 or 4 times, the songs become better and better. Another great album provided by latin rock's best band, but not the first album you want to buy from La Ley."
4,Tramsparente opacidad,"Muy interesante disco con liricos muy inteliligentes y un sonido moderno. Este disco te va llevar a alturas cuando lo escuchas. Los Chilenos, La Ley, ya tienen muchos anos en el rocnEspanol y toda via siguen su asalto con su ultimo disco En vivo MTV. Varios de las canciones en el que es en vivo por MTV estan aqui en sus originales versiones. Este es uno de los mejores discos que ha salido desde Latino America en los ultimos anos con poesia y pasion. La Ley hasta cantan unas canciones en Ingles como ""Krazyworld"" y ""Solitaryman."" Personalmente me prefieren los en Espanol como ""Fotophobia,"" ""Tanta Ciudad"" y ""Guerillerero."" Tambien el disco incluye una parte interactivo con una cancion extra. La parte que se puede ver por su computador es increible. Si te gusta la musica de La Ley y apenas lo estas decubriendo vale la pena comprar este disco de hace unos anos."
5,fusion,"This album is no doubt, another great creation of mana. catchy tunes, hip grooves, and great lyrics. this band is the standard by which all latin rock bands should be judged. this album relates in more ways than one to all the past records. using some the same styles of sounds and music as in the past albums, this album is like a recopilation of old sounds with a modern touch and more refined talent.Buy it, listen carefuly to the songs and lyrics. if you like this album you'll love the past albums.if you don't, give it time it will grow on you."
5,"A terrific mix of latin rhythms, modern rock, superb lyrics","This disc is completely different than Mana's last one (Cuando Los Angeles Lloran), but still as great. Mana continues to mature musically and it shows in this disc. I didn't even know spanish when i began listening to Mana in 1994, but their albums are five good reasons to want to learn! In the end, Mana will be spoken of as one of the worlds greatest bands ever. From the rocking ""Clavado en un bar"" to the rhythmic ""Como te extrano corazon"", Mana hits a solid home run with ""Suenos Liquidos""."
5,Suenos Liquidos es el mejor album que mana tiene.,"Mana es la mejor banda de rock en Espanol en todo LatinoAmerica y en especial en Mexico porque ellos son Mexicanos. Mana es la banda mas reconosida en Estados Unidos,y tambien Mana es y sera la mejor banda CHINGONA que he escuchado en toda mi vida. Les mando un gran saludo al grupo de rock mas padre de esta epoca y pedirles que nunca se separen del grupo. MANA LA BANDA MAS PERRONA DE TODAS LAS BANDAS DE ROCK EN ESPANOL. !HECHALE VAMPIRO!"
1,"-5 stars, if possible...","One of the most annoying bands to come out of Mexico. I still don't understand: WHY? It's such a shame that they are like, THE mexican ""rock"" band. I do have to admit they are good musicians (they play their instruments good, that is), but they are hardly original at all. They really hurt my ears."
5,One of the top three albums.,"Of all the albums this is my favorite. It has melodies that make you want to cry like track #3 while ""clavado en un bar"" brings you back up to existence even though he sings of a broken heart. Overall the theme of ""luquid dream"" serves the album. The tracks are spread in terms of tempo, mood, and melody but they all share the Mana catchy rhyme and rhythm. One of their best."
3,not there best not there worst either,"If your a fan of Mana get it, if your new to them I suggust you listen to some of there others before getting this one."
3,"Worthy, but not their best","Revolucion de amor is a phenomenal work of art. Listen to it everyday, but still a loyal fan of La Ley. The more i listen to these groups, the less i want to listen to american bands. A great music combo to burn on a CD, La Ley, Mana, Evanesence, and a little Juanes to soften it up...."
5,mexican kings,"Fantastic CD. I was first introduced to Mana by Revolucion de Amor hits on Chilean radio. I then bought Unplugged, and within a few months bought what is probably my favorite Mana album, Suenos Liquidos. In fact, since I've been back to the US, it has been one of 2 CDs that I've played over and over again in my car (along with La Ley Unplugged).""Clavado en Un Bar"" is guitar heavy and addictive, and ""Muelle de San Blas"" is spectacular (more upbeat than the later, Unplugged version). ""Como dueles en los labios"" is probably my third favorite of the tracks, but most are good.Though the lyrics are often somewhat depressing and speak of hopelessness and loss, the music itself is quite upbeat and very fun. If you understand the lyrics, this paradox makes the music all the more chilling and fascinating (in particular Clavado en un Bar, in my opinion). If not, just enjoy the tunes!"
4,MANA MUSIC THAT INSPIRES,"When it comes to rock n'espanol, there really isn't any another band that compares to Mana. Through the drumming of Alex, the guitar work of both Sergio and Juan, and most of all through the powerful voice of Fher, Mana has captured time and time again the hearts and minds of it's wide range audience. Suenos Liquidos is an amazing piece of work, that grabbs the souls of all those who listen to it's inspiring lyrics."
5,Music to your Ears.......,"I never enjoyed listening to Spanish Rock, until I attended Mana's concert in Los Angeles. Since that day, my love for Spanish Rock began. Mana are excellent performers who have brought the Spanish Rock music to another level. There music brings out the excitement and energy in everyone. I recommend that you purchase their most recent album and if possible attend a concert near you. I can guarantee that you will get your money's worth......Viva Mexico....."
5,It's about time!,Mana ya era tiempo de que escucharamos musica nueva de Uds. Great job and keep up the great work. See you when you come to Phoenix.
1,mana Caca,"mana is just a cheap spanish-language ripoff of real, original and talented bands such as The Police. They don't live up to the hype. Nothing original. I too, also recommend you stick wiht the Brits."
5,This CD is particularly a work of art and emotion!,"This album is down right amazing. I have never had music as moving and emotional swinging like this. In fact, I really think that suenos liquidos has been the best of their music empire. There is no one particular band that can match their might in Mexico or in latino america period. In essence, any one that would like to feel adrinalin rushed has to own this cd. Most of the the Magic Valley of the Rio Grande(Harlingen TX especially) respects and admires the authentic music this album presents. I hope that MANA never dies. For that matter, the students in the University of Texas Pan American, Edinburg Texas, love MANA. From Shreveport, Louisiana... Chucky M V. ViVa MaNa... Para siempre."
3,OSCAR*****big D based fan,"This album is good,but not as great as the others.I've been a humble fan of MANA since 1993 and felt that this album was not as upbeat and rebellious as i am used to experiencing.I jst thght it was a little too soft.I get hyped when I go clubbing in Mex w/some buddies and hear the intro's to 'Oye Mi Amor' and 'Me Vale' blasting from the speakers, but at the same time, I get annoyed in clubs on this side when I see bandwagoners jammin to the same music they thought was stupid just a few years ago when I would pop it in at a party. YOU GUYS KNOW WHO YOU ARE!!!I'm really hyped for the next concert here August 1st w/Santana!!!!viva R en E :GO STARS!"
5,This cd is the best cd ever!,I listened to the cd and think that it was such a great gathering of wonderful songs. I have listended to Mana for almost two years. Their songs are great to listen too! I think this is the best cd they have recorded.
2,They don't live up to the hype,"I don't understand what all the fuss is about. These guys are just a cheap Spanish-language rip-off of Sting, without the songwriting talent and the modelesque good looks. I'm sticking with the Brits!"
3,good but too slick,"Although the song ""Clavado en un Bar"" absolutely rules, this album just seems a bit too polished. Mana is very tight and gifted musically, and there are many strong songs, but I wish they would ditch their producer or something. ""Hechicera"" is great, but ""Un Lobo Por tu Amor"" is silly. This is a little bit heavier overall then their other albums."
3,Tell Me Jaguar,"this album is ok. not great. while mana is the biggest, most popular spanish rock band, they're not the best. if you want best, i highly recommend Jaguares. now they're the best spanish rock band."
5,Never imagined it was this good!,I used to think Latin Rock was lame..I thought wrong! This CD by far is one of thier best! All the songs are inspirational or upbeat for Dancing! Viva Mana!
5,Peeeerfeeeectooooooooo,"Que los AMO con toda mi alma, se que en realidad lo que lespuda deir, no es nada que antes no han escuchado, tienen tanta gente a su alrededor, buenas y no tanto, yo soy joven como ustedes y que desde el fondo de mi ser quiero decirles algo que se que verdaderamente lo van a recibir de la misma manera como se lo estoy sintiendo, cierro mis ojos por un segundo y antes de escribir le pido a DIOS LOS BENDIGA Y LOS CUIDE MUCHO PARA QUE NUNCA PIERDAN ESE NINO QUE MUCHOS LLEVAMOS POR DENTRO, QUE SE CONSERVA INTACTO EN NUESTRAS VIDAS A PESAR DE NUESTROS ERRORES, GRACIAS POR REGALARME TANTAS ESTRELLAS = SUENOS ANTES DE DORMIR... Y POR HACERME SENTIR CADA VEZ QUE ESCUCHO SUS CANCIONES COMO LO QUE YO SIENTO POR DENTRO HAY OTROS QUE LO PUEDEN CANTAR...LOS AMO Y CUIDENSE MUCHO...LOS AMO, LOS AMO,.OS AMO... DIANA (NANY) = )"
5,"Extremely funny using stereo types, but also politically correct. I loved it then and I love it now!","Being from a third world country, we were not introduce to the show when it first aired, but we got the chance to watch it in the 1980's. I had fun watching it then and I love watching it now. I get my American friends to watch it with me and they love it. Is there any more DVD's or is the volume 4 the last one? If anyone who reads this knows the answer, could you post your reply? Thank you in advance!Nejat A.California, United States"
2,Save your money,"This book is by no means all bad. There is some good advice, some useless advice, and some just plain bad advice. The problem is that the author did not label the different kinds of advice, probably because he did not know the difference. A better book is Performance Rock Climbing. A much better book is Climbing : training for peak performance."
5,An AMAZINGLY Entertaining Look At How Things Began,"I'm a tough reviewer and only give five stars when truly merited. This deserves it. If you're curious about how things originated, this is THE book for you. A great example:The material we use to make blue jeans was first created in a town called Nimme, France (prob spelled that wrong, but doesn't matter for this example's sake.) In france, the word 'from' is 'de.' De Nimme, means from Nimme, or, denim, as we know call the material we use to make blue jeans.If you like this kind of stuff you'll love this book."
4,Classic Comedy,"2 out of 3 isn't bad. The ""Our Gang"" disc and the ""Three Stooges"" disc are excellent. However, the ""Abbott and Costello"" disc leave much to be desired, as it is made up only of short clips."
1,WARNING: This product contains flawed compacitors!,"I recently went to turn on this black light and noticed an intense burning smell. At first I thought it was my PC but noticed smoke coming from the black light itself. Upon opening of the black light ballast I noticed a capacitor had failed, blew its top, and started an electrical fire. Luckily I noticed it in time where only the ballast got destroyed rather than my entire house! Upon further research I have confirmed that this product uses flawed capacitors. It is unconfirmed whether the flawed capacitors are in every single ballast made by this company but I would use extreme caution when using this black light. A flawed capacitor can simply cause a total failure of the ballast, or a fire capable of burning down your entire house! You have been warned."
5,Unusual size drill bit,"I am working on a hobby project and needed a 21/32"" drill. Amazon as usual came through. this drill bit did the job just fine."
2,disappointed,I had ordered the origanal 1st pal. I received the one with the diaper. It was not the one pictured by company. A customer posted the diaper picture. should have known. 1st time ordering and not happy. Baby however likes the toy. I wanted to give him the smaller one.
4,engaging stories,The book contains ten fine stories telling of the misadventures of always-engaging characters. Each story rolls along at an impressive clip and as a whole the book tells a cohesive story of otherwise regular people making money in fairly unusual ways. Highly recommended.
4,Recommended for humor,"If you are looking at this title, you probably are thinking it's an amusing read. It is, it's fast, and it's worth it. Some of the things you learn will be surprising. Additionally, this book's concepts make for GREAT party conversation.However, this book does not provide details on successful implementation of a criminal enterprise. If that is what you seek, look elsewhere."
5,Another star among their other products,"These eclairs are remarkable. They are light and their filling is creamy. Chaltila's bakery has the finest assortment of bread, pies, bagels, pasttries, and even sugar-free chocolate. This company is a true find."
5,An inside look at an interesting woman,"Camilla is a mystery in a many ways - her name is well known, but, not all that much is known about what she is really like. This book give a satisfying look at the woman who was the third party in the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales. Not always flattering, but, always fascinating, it tells the story of Camilla's life in a manner that shouldn't offend any die hard Diana fans (I am one). It left me wanting to know more about her, satified my desire for trivial details and left me with some admiration on this easy to dislike woman. After all, she and Charles have had a relationship for far longer than most marriages last, and, when all is said and done, he has a right to be happy. The whole saga of Charles, Diana and Camilla is a lesson to the world on marrying for the right reasons and the need to be clear on motives and motivations."
3,Update of an older book,"This is just an update of an earler Caroline Graham book, The King's Mistress. I dont beleive that the author was being very objective in her treatment of the subject matter. The late princess Diana is not portrayed in a good light, whilst Camilla is seen as just a woman in love. She comes across as so very caring, kind, giving and loving, its a wonder her own ex-husband didn't hold on to her. Overall though, the book is well written and does give some insight into the woman who may or may not be queen."
1,What is the decency of this author?,"She will justify anything coming from Camilla and Charles, gossiping like Lady Campbell and attribute every single fault to Diana. Where is your moral? Camilla was pestering this couple for all these years, insincere in wanting their best. Why she didn't get a life ? Leave the poor couple to live peacefully? She really stole another woman's husband. I imagine how much Camilla is paying to this wretched author to write this sordid book. Diana should have sent or hire someone to eliminate this bothering woman in the first place. This will put her in her right place. But Diana was decent in just getting out of this sham marriage instead of persisting it despite all the privileges of royal life. She was being far more honest in wanting to terminate it than many women who will stay in this sordid marriage just for the food."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"BUYER BEWARE ITS NOT WORTH BUYING THIS BATTERY , YOU MAY SAVE A LITTLE MONEY BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO GO BUY ACID FOR IT SO YOU REALLY DONT SAVE A DIME, PLUS YOU HAVE TO DRIVE SOMEWHERE TO GET THE ACID, JUST GO TO YOUR LOCAL BIKE SHOP ,"
3,XBOX-360 USERS MUST READ,"This does NOT Work with the XBOX-360 Console... Only on the Original Xbox will it Work. Don't get me wrong, I love this game, I had it on my Ps2. I was really looking forward to playing it. It's a 4 star game rating for sure, but the experience with this was just bad; I will keep this just for the heck of it though. Enjoy!"
4,"way better than Amped, but it's no SSX tricky","this game is cool. i really enjoyed it. i think that it is pretty challenging. the only thing about it that is weak is the fact that your runs are rather short and this is wack!but, i really shouldn't complain since i bought amped and hated it. i really like this game it is very realistic and the best of all it is [inexpensive].but it or rent it you won't be disappointed!"
4,Excellent but needs a good editor,"Lockshin has done a great service by translating and annotating Rashbam's Torah commentary. Exodus is the longest and most detailed. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for Lockshin's astonishing verbosity and repetitiveness. Also, his adding a ""vav"" to nearly every Hebrew word from the text where a cholam appears became increasingly irritating. If one can go with the flow of these two weakness, and simply try to enter into Rashbam's analytical and exegetical processes, it's a fulfilling and exciting ride."
1,As in the words of a smart man...THIS GAME SUX,"Ok, well...saw this one at the video store and said to myself...Hmm, looks good to me. So I decided to give it a go. I was in dismay as I looked at the number of events there were. Six...SIX EVENTS! To me this is simply not enough. What happened to the good ole days of many events on an olympic game that required you to do button taps until your fingers bled. I miss those days. But we are given this, hideous excuse for an Olympic Sim. Do yourself a favor and go get Dance Dance Revolution and do some actual physical exercise. And its fun too."
2,What a crappy excuse for a Winter Olympics game,"... I bought the ps Nagano '98 a long time ago thinking that it would be just like the N64 version. In stark contrast, it was horrible. I saw Salt Lake 2002 at my local rental store,looked at the back cover and thought that in no way could they possibly turn out another game as poor as Nagano, and I should give it a shot. So, i rented it. I am sorry to say it's just as bad, and actually worse. I couldn't even get through thirty minutes of it. The graphics are poor even for a ps2, the sound is awful, the commentary ... and the controls are atrocious. The ski jumping is awful and the bobsled is just as bad. You get never sensation of speed or any sensation at all, really. The gameplay feels really dead. There's no life to any of it. The long shots of the courses before each run you make are stupid and unnecessary. Need I say more? This game isn't even worth the 5 bucks i spent renting it."
1,Really really bad....,"This is quite possibly the worst game I have ever played on the PS2, or for almost any system for that matter. I'd rather bring out my Super Nintendo and play that instead of this boring piece of .... The graphics are bad, the sound [stinks], the gameplay's slow as ..., and to top it all off there are only 6 events, which are all equally terrible. I mean 6 events in a Winter Olympics game?? Give me a break this is an 128 bit system here. It's tolerable.. and I mean barely tolerable.. for about 15 minutes before I want to throw the pretty case in the garbage. I think it is safe to say that I am now dumber after playing this game. I award this game one star, and may God have mercy on everyone at Eidos' soul...."
4,the graphics kicked @$$,"i loved the graphics also the gamplay the hardest part is the mens ski jump because it was hard at first ,and the speed of the gaame is too fast...SLOW DOWN:]"
1,Salt Lake 2002,"I received this game as a Christmas gift and having never heard of it, was pretty excited to check it out. However, after around 30 minutes of frustration, I just couldn't take it any more. Most of the reviews on this game pretty much sum up why this is so bad but there are a few things that stand out most to me, such as: The pathetically small number of events, the dead unrealistic feel, and the painfully long process of re-trying or switching an event... ugh!"
2,Disappointing,...I have more fun playing the '98 Winter Games on N64 than this. Limited things you can do. The 6 events get boring after a while...
3,"Gold Medal Expectations, Bronze Medal Results","Graphics are excellent and it is fun to play, but WHY ONLY SIX EVENTS?! WHERE IS THE SPEED SKATING?! Play control is difficult and not very intuitive. If you are an Olympics enthusiast as I am, it is probably worth buying. Otherwise, I suggest you pass this video game up. The 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics deserve better than this.Note: I purchased this game for my P2 in the vain hope it was superior to the PC version. It was virtually the same. Therefore, the review is the same."
2,Nice Try,"Salt Lake 2002 is not a bad game, but it isn't good either. The graphics are excellent, but some of the events are bad. Bobsleigh, and skiing aren't bad but the others are. You dont stay into it for long. I liked it for a while, but it gets boring."
1,There is no way this could make the Olympic Team,"This game is horrible. It only has six different events, and the graphics are not that good. the playability is not that good. it is extremely hard to control the board and skis in the alpine and slolom as well as the snowboarding event. the ski jump is very bad. don't buy this game!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This game stinks on water,I absoloutely hate this game into the ground. I jumped on it when I first played it. I refunded it straight away but they said they couldn't because it was too damaged. So now its sitting in the oven and I'm going to get rid of my ps2.
5,50 Minutes of WWII footage from Superior Home Video,"On February 17,1944, American forces in the Pacific launched a two-day bombing mission against the Japanese, resulting in the destruction of over 40 ships, 200 planes and thousands of soldiers - now entombed under 300 feet of water. This is the story of the invasion and the days, months and years that followed; featuring dramatic WWII footage.superiorvideo.com"
5,Wonderful story!,"I discovered Pamela Clare, just 5 months ago and since then I have bought all of her books that are published. I love all of her stories, but the 2 books published so far, about the McKinnon brothers, is my absolute favourites. Her eye for details, her knowledge of early American history and Native Americans during those turbulent years, are amazing! I recommened everyone who love historical romance to read Pamela Clare! I am looking forward to the next installment in the McKinnon brothers saga!"
2,blah,while I liked Pamela Clares other series i didn't like this one. For me it wasn't the heroine almost being rape two or three times or the violence in the book. It was the heroine herself. She was so stupid. About 100 pages in I couldn't stand her. This may be wrong and I'm sorry but I was kinda hoping she did get rape. That was how much I didn't like her. I didn't even finish the book even through I need to finish it to make a character guide for my blog I just don't think I can. I also don't like Ian or his brothers. It will be a long time before I finish the series.Another thing that got me mad how how men kept falling for her Every page the Author had to mention how beautiful the heroine was. Makes me want to gag. I was also hoping her uncle had banned her face instead.I'm Sorry Mrs. Clare. I love you but not this book or series.
2,"Violence/Gore 75%, Romance 25%","It's refreshing to read historicals with good detail, but this author went too heavily into the violence of the time. I want to read about ROMANCE when I pick up a romance, not grisly scenes of the heroine being branded with a hot iron, the heroine being beaten, or the hero being flogged. The sex is quite explicit, but this in no way makes up for the extreme graphic violence. I can only give this book two stars, and doubt I'll re-read it. Good colonial adventure, bad romance."
2,Too repetitive and spoke of rape,"The writing in this book is extremely repetitive. Terms and phrases like ""Mercy!"", ""bonnie,"" ""bairn"" and ""she felt tears prick her eyes,"" were worn out to the point of eye rolling. Worse is that there was too much talk of rape. Our heroine is annoying and repeatedly feels guilty about EVERYTHING! She was also almost raped twice in the book. The first time she was almost gang raped. Our hero is likeable for about the first and last 100 pages. In-between that, he was angry and rude. For example, the first time they had sex was after he was told she was with another man. Iain came to her, enraged, to ""claim her"" as his own. It was also the same day that she was almost raped. I did enjoy the last 100 pages or so, but the above issues left a bitter taste in my mouth. This is the 3rd book I have read by this author and they keep going down hill. If you want to read a GOOD book by Pamela Clare, read Naked Edge....I am so far unimpressed by her others."
3,surrender,This author really did her research. I was very impressed with all the detail. There was a little too much of the war aspect though. I'm not a big fan of slicing and shooting.One thing I found that was quite weird was that Annie's father was supposedly the most honorable man and her uncle was the most despicable. It left me wondering how this came about that two brothers could be so different. I would have liked to hear about their history. Lord Wentworth was a fantastic character and was not the typical one dimensional villain. He should probably have his own book where he battles his inner demons and becomes an honorable man.
2,Needs a real editor,"While I have enjoyed the story greatly, I have one complaint. It may seem harsh to give such a low star rating based on one complaint but this is a large issue. I have an electronic version of this book which I read on my Kindle. Perhaps it is not the author, or editor, at fault but the electronic file I purchased. The vast quantities of typographical errors made reading this text nearly impossibe. Her name up to the mid point or so is Miss Burns, not Miss Bums. While his name is Iain, she has lain with him. One being a person's name, the other a verb, and not interchangable. If english is not your first language, or if you do not have a good grasp of the written word, I implore you to not purchase this book as it will confuse you."
3,It was ok until the final third,"This book started out promising but lost me about 2/3's of the way in when I started rolling my eyes and forcing myself to turn the pages. Guess I'm just not in the mood for bonny highlanders and virginal lassies making love while rape and murder awaits at every turn. The dialect was annoyingly repetitive and though I'm always up for a lusty romp I just couldn't believe some of the actions of these two. And sorry but I find nothing heroic about a guy who wants to ""claim"" a woman who he believes has just been raped. That's not romantic it's horrific."
5,Prepare to Surrender!,"When you pick up this book, be prepared to Surrender your time, because you will not be able to put it down! From the first paragraph all the way to the end, it's an exciting ride! Pamela Clare makes the frontier come alive, along with enough celtic ambiance for those of us who love stories set in the Highlands of Scotland. The story is fast paced and full of action, with humor and lots of sexual tension. Iain is the perfect hero (one of my all time favorites) and Annie is more than his match. The secondary characters are very well developed and I can't wait for Connor and Morgan's stories."
5,Top notch historical,"I was one of the super lucky people to get an ARC of this book, and it was an excellent read from cover to cover! Pamela's characters stay with you long after you finish her books, and her writing style is some of the best I've ever read. I own all of her books and they all belong on my keeper shelf. If you even just like historical romance, you will LOVE Pamela Clare's books. I think one of the things that makes her books so great is the amazing historical detail that goes into them. She makes you feel like you're there! The love story between Ian and Annie is wonderful and the love scenes are HOT!!! You won't regret purchasing this book!!"
5,something to listening and watch when feeling nostalgic,"I purchased this dvd in a local bookstore and what a gift of music chris releases in all his songs, the sound quality is excellent along with the video quality, don't think twice in buying this dvd, it's a jewel every music fan must have in his/her collectionThanks Chris you are AWESOME!!!!"
1,chris isaak,"After opening the Chris Isaak CD, it wouldn't play in the car. After a minute, it would eject by itself. Other CDs I own were fine in the CD player. The Chris Isaak CD does play ok on the home CD player. Could you suggest reasons or a solution for this problem? I've never incurred it before.Thanks."
2,Doesn't really add anything,"I bought this DVD hoping for a sound quality superior to the original CD's. If you think about buying the DVD for that same reason: don't. The new songs aren't all that great either. It seems to me that Chris Isaak should either take a radical step or go back to the sparce production of his older music, because his latest work, including the new songs on this album, are overproduced and less transparent than his older work."
1,So disappointed,I bought this lunch kit and received a different Barbie lunchbox in a completely different color scheme/picture than what is pictured. Have to go through the return process now which is a pain. Wish I could get the one pictured - it's adorable!
5,NOTORIOUS WOMAN,"I LOOK FORWARD TO READING THIS BOOK, AS I LIVE IN THE NEW ORLEANS AREA. ACTUALLY, I LOANED IT TO A FRIEND WHO REPORTS THAT IT WAS INTERESTING, INTRIGUING AND INFORMATIVE."
3,"Buen disco, aunque no el mejor","Joven para Morir (1986) es el 3er album de A.D.I. el cual muestra una tendencia un poco mas comercial que se refleja en temas como ""Lo Tomas o lo Dejas"", ""Loco de Atar"" y ""Pensando en Ti"".El sonido del disco es un poco desigual, hay temas que se escuchan muy sólido, como ""No te dejes vencer"" y ""Joven para Morir"", y en otros sin tanto punch.Es un disco que debes tenerlo, si ya eres seguidor de A.D.I."
5,Russ Martin is Still Around.,Russ Martin is still around. Check out his web sites;http://www.russmartin.comhttp://www.russmartin.info
4,The Nature of Alexander,"Fascinating, even if his fame is known. Produces thoughts on the nature of greatness, the power of personality, the value of allowing others to keep their dignity and mores, and theamazing accomplishments that a human being is capable of when personality, nature, opportunity and ability are conjoined. Most currently useful quote (Kipling):When you're wounded an' left on Afghanistan's plains,An' the women come out to cut up what remains,Jest roll to your rifle an' blow out your brains..."
1,Most Boring Tiresome book I ever read,"I hate this book. My school asigned this book. It is an extreamly diffcult book to read. It is not a book, it is like a history text book!"
2,Not what I thought it was going to be.,"I am a Lay Pastor and was looking for a book for someone struggling with their faith. This book was not what I thought it was going to be. It is alright, but I would not recommend it to someone struggling with their faith. I think it would just confuse them more."
2,Alright,"Just that - alright. Nothing fancy. Note that the songs aren't performed by the original artists. As it says on the box: ""made famous by"". I probably wouldn't have bought the cds if I'd noticed that, but the songs are nice, so, thats alright..."
5,A scholarly and thoroughly researched presentation,"Turmoil & Truth: The Historical Roots Of The Modern Crisis In The Catholic Church is a meticulous analysis by Philip Trower of the diverse woes besetting Catholic Church today and the roots of this modern church turmoil. Delving for answers into the previous centuries, and introducing the reader to critical historical events which caused ripples far outside their era, Turmoil & Truth is a scholarly and thoroughly researched presentation seeking to understand the origin of corrosive divisiveness found within the Roman Catholic Church today in America, Europe, and Australia."
1,Too Small,"This was a bad choice for me, the poster was too small and did not add the value i liked, the colours do not pop, its just average. i have seen some similar posters with different flowers and colours and they seemed to be a better choice. the service was great non the less."
5,This CD is the best!!!!,"Hi! I am Maria, this CD is the best I never heard, I do not heard the ""salsa"" music but this is the exception. Quisiera algun dia conocerlos en persona.De verdad que los admiro. Congratulations!!!! Servando y Florentino."
2,LOS PRIMERAS,"ESTE CD ES UNA ESTRELLA CAIDA DEL CIELO,CADA UNA DE LAS LETRAS DE ESTE CD ES UN EXELENTE EJEMPLAR PARA CADA UNA DE LAS FANS QUE SEGUIMOS A ESTOS GRANDES CHICOS QUE SON UN ORGULLO ,POR QUE ELLOS SE MERECEN TODO LO MEJOR DEL MUNDO Y ESPERO QUE DIOS LOS BENDIGAN EN CADA UNO DE SUS PROYECTOS Y QUE SIGAN ADELANTE PRODUCIENDO EXITOS QUE VALEN LA PENA ESCUCHAR, ELLOS SON UNICOS, BELLOS,BAILARINES PROFESIONALES, LOS AMOS SERVANDO Y FLORENTINO VIVEN CONMIGO SIEMPRE EN MI CORAZON Y MI MENTE. ELLOS TIENEN ESE SWING QUE NADIE PUEDE IMITAR EN ESPECIAL CUANDO HACEN ESE MOVIMIENTO DE CADERAS. LOS QUIEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Y LOS AMOOOOOOOOOOO DEMASIADO."
3,Nice with a prob...,Euro-Pro F1052 Professional 2-Liter Stainless-Steel Deep FryerNice fryer holds our big tenderloin. Heats up decent. Not huge like some are. BUT often times the reset will pop when it is turned off. Use ink pen and reset to get it working again. Would be 5 stars if not for this.
1,"Gets Ruined Quickly, No Warranty Support Either","This deep fryer worked well for the first few times I used it. Eventually, it started working sporadically, and I would have to press the button many times before it finally turned on. Then, it stopped working completely. I called for support, but they never answer. If you call the number, then press 3 for customer support, the call will end and you will never get to talk to a representative.Basically, save your money for a better fryer and a better brand in general that actually provides the support that they promise their customers when they sell the product."
1,Disappointed,"My husband and daughters bought me this deep fryer for Christmas 2009. Within a few short months and about 4 uses, the fryer stopped working. It was plugged in heated up and it just went off and never came back on. We sent it back and received a new one, and were very happy with the exchange process. However, it has happened again to the replacement.I expected it to last much longer than a year and a half with simple home use. I will not exchange or purchase another Euro Pro item again."
1,This does not deserve a rating at all - 0 star.,"I have the 1066 Deep Fryer. Initially it worked sporadically, I couldn't figure out the trick, my son in law said the safety feature made it very important to get the control panel on ""just so"". Didn't matter, I never got it to work, (he did, once)so I ordered a replacement control panel. I was pretty excited on new Year's to have Egg Rolls - NOT! This time the control panel lit up like it was going to work, but the heating element remained cold. The reset button, which I've been told to push over and over again by the customer service people doesn't work either! I've had the replacement control panel nearly 6 weeks. I called wanting to return it and try ONE more time - but they wanted me to BUY another! When I repled with never mind, I'll throw this away and buy something American made, she offered me the 1052 model for 19.00 After reading the review about quality... I think I'll throw it away."
2,"Honestly, We are been rip-off","First the company gets the product very very cheap, around $5. Don' believe it, oh well, i have done lots of research, this items are shiped to the US very cheap, is ok, it is call business, and i understand all the stuff they have to pay, but above all that they take advantage, beside the expensive price that you pay, you get a piece of junk, for , or it brakes, or stop working, or the material is poor quality, the style looks good but when you get to have it in your hands and tested that is another story. This is why before buying inthe internet , shop around the internet, do research, compare prices, quality, check the consumer report on products this is very helpful, go to the store and check it out first and if is convenient and better price online then go for it. Well , hope my review help you all, next time buy your items directly from china it is very cheap and easy, I haven't had a problem yet. Thanks G. DHgate.com honestly check it out."
4,Full of great ideas for activities...,"This book contains one educational activity for each week of your childs life, from birth to age 5. Although you are humorlessly instructed to do the activities in order, repeating the activity-of-the-week daily, the book is still useful in real life. Every few weeks, I flip through the sections for my children's ages and get ideas. The activities are exactly age appropriate- even the ones for young babies. They generally (but not always) use stuff you have around the house. And they are often ideas you might not think of on your own. I have also found that the activities have a good time-enjoyed to clean-up-the-mess time ratio!"
3,"great concept, mediocre delivery","I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend who is homeschooling her 2 kids. I won't be homeschooling, and I work outside of the house. But I like the principles of taking an active role in developing my daughter's mind & body. This book provides great activities to engage your little one. My daughter has enjoyed the games. I enjoy the new ideas. However, the writing is overly-simplistic. The illustrations are weak. An online resource pushing weekly activity emails encourages many of the same conepts. But I still like having the book so I can go back or jump ahead to meet my daughter's development stage. Buy a used/discounted copy if you can."
3,Not impressed,"I am reviewing my comments and I was not given the chance to change the stars from 3 to 1. I tried to use the book again with my daughter and it didn't work. Definetely not happy with purchase. I bought this book in 2005 and my son was extremely bored. Tried to use it with my daughter and it just didn't work for her. The author says that it is too late if you don't stimulate your child by the age of 3. Parents should not become paranoid by authors who try to be so ""by the book."" My kids are very bright and the ideas given on this book can be easily figured out by any parent. Some activities are not very practical."
5,Great book,Have used for all of my children. Good for someone who is diligent about raising children. Good for people like me who sometimes lack the creativity to come up with activites.
5,very happy with purchase,I recieved this quickly and the book was as it was described. I have enjoyed using it. I would purchase from this seller again.
1,Booooooorrrriiiiiiiiiiing,"My husband bought this book when our daughter was a baby. They seem to assume that playing with your baby is of no use and teaches them nothing. Instead you must spend ridiculous amounts of time setting up elaborate activities that might entertain baby for a few minutes. I have to assume that a simple set of baby's stacking cups can be as useful a tool for teaching the concept of colors and sizes, and that we don't need an instruction manual for teaching baby what ""blue"" means.This book is rather insulting and could only be good for someone who has absolutely no clue what to do with their baby, and who would otherwise just be sitting there dumbly, not speaking to or interacting with their baby at all. If you find this book actually teaches you how to interact with your baby, perhaps you should have gotten a puppy instead. =)"
4,Good Resource for Baby,"This book is a good resource of activities to do with baby. Some of the activities are beyond baby's abilties but overall the book offers activities that baby gets excited about, and are very engaging. I feel its a good buy!"
3,Great If You Don't Have a Clue Where to Start,This is a great book if you don't already have a clue about where to start. The premise that children *won't* be stimulated if you don't do just what the book says at week 13 doesn't take into account the natural stimulating we do for our babies and kids all the time.
2,A little boring,I sent this book back as it was too boring for me. I didn't think the ideas where very original either. The entire 4th year is each letter of the alphabet and then the numbers. I think I could figure that idea out on my own.
4,Development,"This is a great product that gives you ideas on how to play with your baby to help them develop in a variety of areas. Because it spans from birth through age five, it is a great tool to invest in."
5,Fantastic Resource!!!!,"This wonderful book outlines everything you need to prepare your child for kindergarten. It covers not only the educational aspects of preschool, but also the physical and socioemotional, as well as problem-solving skills. It is a great resource for anyone with a small child. The book contains weekly activities to help your child grow and develop. The activities range from birth to 5 years, but don't be disappointed if you didn't start at week 1 - the activities don't exactly build on each other and any preschool child can benefit from the different activities listed. I am going through the book with my 6-month-old and my 2-year-old. With my 2-yeard-old, he already can do alot of the weekly activities, so we pick and choose what to focus on."
5,Excellent book.,"I was looking for a true educational book to help me to help my toddler (now preschooler) build on fine motor skills and other age appropriate milestones. It is a great book of fun and educational things to do with your kid/s. My boys love the activities and I love that it has creative, and well though out ""skills"" you can help your child with. Parents as your childs first and most important teacher this book is great!"
1,"It was described as ""no sugars""","I've been using this product for years and loved the ""lite"" with MSM because it had no sugar and 0 calories. When my last order arrived the product contained fructose and 5 calories. I thought it was sent in error and asked for a replacement, which promptly arrived. The replacement was the same, so I returned it and no longer take Emergen-C"
5,Rudd for World President,An amazing performer with deep love for the Earth.His mix of reggae and folk and aborginal music is beautifuland haunting .I loved this cd so much I bought the rest of his music.His vocal qualities remind me of a young Paul Simon.Would vote him for World President because of his love of Mother Earth!
1,Cover leaves grey film,"My Evolution cover (purchased through Amazon, but not from Car Cover World)left a horrible grey film on my car during the first use. The manufacturer said the cover just needed to be washed first. The instruction sheet they send with the cover says it can only be washed in a non-agitating commercial machine and then must be dried on the car! And, washing the cover may reduce its protective qualities!! A cover that needs to be washed before it can be used--and may be damaged in the washing process--is, in my opinion, a poorly made and defective product."
4,"Nice, mellow hour of June doing little-heard lyrics...","This is a worthy addition to the collection of any Christy fans or fans of jazz singing in general. The majority of songs here are not going to be found anywhere else, but almost all of them are quality efforts. Since I am currently suffering from a broken heart, the ones that ""get"" me are items such as ""Nobody's Heart Belongs to Me"" and ""Lonely House"" and ""The Night We Called it a Day."" If you have just fallen in love, however, then your life will be enhanced by ""My One and Only Love"" and several other optimistic ballads. June is in uniformly good voice in this collection, but there is nothing up-tempo, so if you want lively stuff, buy her other releases."
2,Clumsy assembly and not Sturdy,"I purchased this bin last season and have regretted it every since. The top access doors are VERY difficult to open and when opening they fly off the mounting. After opening these doors are just as hard to latch. Most times I have to remove the entire lid.When aerating the contents the compost tends to stick to the sides of the bin and while lifting the contents the bin comes apart. The side doors are useless, since the material wont let them easily slide upwards.The only redeeming part of this bin (other than it is already paid for) is that it is expandable, but than who can stand that high???Find an alternative, this is not a good buy."
5,Good choice for inexpensive composter,"I was looking for my first composter and wanted something large enough but that didn't cost a fortune. A spinning barrels would have been nice to make it easier to mix the pile, but they were too expensive. And others seemed too small for what I would need. This one seemed to be a good compromise and was relatively inexpensive compared to most.So far I am happy with this composter. It is literally a snap to put together, with snap in place panels. It seems to be relatively durable and is attractive enough. I've already filled this one up and am just waiting for some black gold. Recommended."
4,Works as advertised,"What can you say about a composer? It works as advertised as long as you turn the compost regularly and make sure it remains moist. About the size of a large garbage can, which should be enough for a home garden and the waste produced by a small household."
1,Not pleased with the results,I have had this composter for going on my third year and have yet to get good results. I put in yard waste and household waste so I should have enough green and brown material but have yet to get any of the good stuff for my garden.
2,"Maybe too easy...,","I purchased this product as a beginner composter. It was very easy to put together, I did so with my 8 year old granddaughter; now we'll see whether I get the composting material we want.Now, after a while trying it out, I find that it doesn't compost in 3 months as it says. I wanted something that I didn't have to turn everyday that would still work. This one is not it. After a few years some of the bottom layers have composted, but it doesn't compost as easily as it clams."
1,DIDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE,"I had high hopes for this. I bought three sets and used one set in each drawer. Wen I opened the package, the smell was great. once i put the drawers....nothing. Old smell still there."
2,MOTHS IN THE CLOSET,"I AM NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS PRODUCT. A NICE SMELL BUT IT DID NOT WORK-AND I BOUGHTTHE CEDAR OIL AND SPRAYED THE CEDAR HANGARS WITH THAT AND I STILL HAVE MOTHS. ITDOES NOT PREVENT THEM FROM REPRODUCING. MAYBE THEY DON'T LIKE THE SMELL, BUTRATHER THAN SENDING THEM AWAY, THEY SEEM TO RELOCATE. I AM VERY UPSET."
2,Weak smell,"While these boards are relatively large with a nice finish, I have trouble even smelling the cedar aroma with them to my face. I ordered these because I love the smell of cedar but will get my next replacement in a store where I can make sure they pass the ""sniff test""."
5,Fantastic examples throughout,"It isn't a secret that this book contains loads of great optical illusions, but I just want to add my vote that this is a great book and will be greatly appreciated by anyone who enjoys this type of art. They have picked several of the best examples from a variety of artists. They type of art ranges from drawings, paintings, sculptures, and combinations of all of the above. I highly recommend this book to anyone!"
5,OpTiCaL ilLuSiOn!,"Masters of Deception: Escher, Dali & the Artists of Optical Illusion. This book is Awesome! The book contains some of the classic optical illusion that most have seen in other works of arts. The book will surely get your attention and your children will love figuring out the images that they see in the pictures."
3,Fascinating imagery,"Overall this is a fascinating book, interesting to read and fun to look through the pictures. My only complaint is with a few of the images which are too small to appreciate. 2 x 4 inches is not sufficient to enjoy Escher's detailed graphics, and I found myself using a magnifying glass at times. Thankfully this is the exception, and many images are almost full-page size. Even if you know nothing about art, this is an enjoyable book, because you will find yourself amazed by the clever images."
5,Something everyone would find interesting,"I teach high school freshmen, and I keep this book on my shelf for students to look through on their own time. It is easily one of the most popular books, and after only three years the wear is beginning to prove this. I don't know how many times I have dropped it off at a student's table because they were bored, and dared them to not find something interesting in the book. Without fail, a students will be engrossed in the book within minutes.One of the best features about this book compared to other books of its kind is that it contains dozens of examples of dozens of various types of art. Beyond the typical optical illusions, it features trompe d'loeil murals, artwork created with hair or chocolate syrup, artwork that can only be viewed with a reflective cylinder, and much more. As I mentioned before, nearly everyone will find something fascinating in this book."
5,Good quality,"This is a very good book, specially in my case because i'm not an expert in arts or design and i could know the most important authors in optical illusions. Beautiful."
4,Great Illusions,"I bought this book for a Christmas present, so have not read the script. However, I have viewed all the illustrations, and think the book is worth buying just for those."
4,Masters of Deception,"As an art teacher I'm always looking for good books to help motivate and stimulate the imaginations of my students. This time one of my students brought this book to show me. He had received it as a holiday gift and I proceeded to buy it for my husband for the holidays as well. Images by famous professional artists that use optical illusions are always intriguing and Al Seckel has created a nice collection here using informative captions to help decipher the work. This kind of book particularly appeals to the math and engineering mind, although it can be enjoyed by all. My husband, a math teacher, will bring it into his teaching repetoire. ""Masters of Deception"" can be used in a multidisciplined way educationally and is a great coffee table book to be enjoyed at random."
3,fairly decent,"This game is pretty decent, but it feels like there should have been more included. I don't want people to get the wrong idea, I liked the game, I just wish it didn't feel so empty all the time."
3,I bought the series Alias,"I bought it and watched it and it was great, however, attempting to watch it a second time brought to my attention, flaws in the movies, skips, slow pauses, etc."
5,Great Purchase!,"This box set is incredible. It's a must-have for any Alias fan! If you're a collector, you'll love this set. It's the most unique box set I own. The lid is magnetic, and the sides of the box flip up and magnetize to the lid. The design of the box even references the show with Irina inscribed on the lid. This set is well worth the money."
1,Horrible Package,"Don't get me wrong, I'm an Alias obsessee. But the packaging for this item was horrible. I received the first one and 90% of the discs were scratched. I then received a replacement and every since one of the discs were scratched. The box sleeves are just not a good structure at all and damage the discs. It will be much easier to simply have all of the seasons separately, the discs have a much greater chance of not being so damaged then."
1,After 4 Sets That Didn't work...,"As my title say's I purchaced 1 set and had 3 replacements, none of which worked. There was warping, finger prints in the dvd's themselves and a whole host of other problems. I wouldn't buy this set or recommend it. I've gotten my money back but it was a HUGE disapointment."
3,Disappointing!,"I have all 4 seasons of Alias on DVD but I bought the Complete Collection because of all the bonus features. Whoever marketed this product is really stretching the truth by saying a hardbook 'book' is included. I would call it more of a 'booklet' considering it is about the size of liner notes in a CD case and maybe 20 pages. The contents of the 'book' are disappoining as well. It featues questions and answers that most fans already know and pics from episodes - I thought mayeb they would include some behind the scenes footage but nope.If you don't have any of the Alias DVD's then this set is worth getting. If you are just buying it for the 'bonus features' that could only be found in the set, then I would skip it."
1,Do Not Buy This DVD Set,"I read several reviews here that warned me that this boxed set has a known quality control problems. I decided to take a chance, but shouldn't have. The disks come in a hard cardboard folio. Per the warning, I inspected the disks carefully. Every disk had small scratches and smudges. It looked like they had been packed by someone who had just eaten fried chicken. They were new, but looked used. Two of the disks has major scratches. It would take me several months to view all the 29 disks, so I couldn't take a chance and had to return them to Amazon. I immediately ordered the regular 1st season package and recommend you buy in that format too."
1,damaged gift,all the dvd are scratched up you can not watch the movies. terrible product. trying to return
3,Missing disc,"I love Alias more than any other show I can remember. So, I was very excited when I was able to purchase the full series. Problem is that it's not the whole series. The first SEASON wasn't even in the box. What kind of ""Complete Collection"" doesn't have the first season!? I loved the box it came in and the discs were in good shape. BUT, not complete and I paid a pretty penny for this collection. I am not happy about the missing season, at all!!!"
5,"USA box set great, can recommend it enough","I bought this box set for my husband as a birthday present after reading all the reviews for the USA and the UK box set. Ae we have a multi regiondvd player, i decided to go with the USA version, because of the reviews that it was much better than the UK one, and also the price difference.The box set took 3 weeks to arrive, which was not a problem as I ordered it in plenty of time for my husbands birthday. Even with the 22 import duties the set came in at under 100, which was a bargain.I openned the box and carefully checked every disk to make sure they they were not scratched. I must say that the disks were very dirty, and some were scratched, but seemed to play ok.The box itself is very lovely, with a plush plum velvetlining and the hidden compartment and with the added disk and book at made a great present.I am so glad that I bough the USA box set,"
5,Alias Seasons 1 thru 5 + Rambaldi artifact box,All was excellent and arrived as expected..already watched four seasons. Thanks for a good deal.
5,The best present an Alias lover could get!,"I have been waiting for this complete set and am very happy with it. The design is fantastic, the extra hidden disc great. Only problem,now I have no more Alias to look forward to! If you are a fan or know one this is the best gift you could give them!"
4,"Great design idea, not so great excecution","I to bought the the complete set and I love the cool design. But every one of my disk was also scratched. So far, I haven't had any issues with the disks skipping or freezing."
2,Food For Thought,"At one time I would've recommended Alias as the all-time greatest TV series ever made! Though the plots are intriguing and tied together throughout 6 seasons in amazing ingenuity, if you're questioning this on the basis of whether or not it is a good movie suitable to watch with family values, it is definitely not.There is nothing explicit in it (no nudity or extreme profanity, etc), and the violence is relatively managed and not gory. But fidelity has no place in the TV series, and truth is greatly maligned as this series brings sympathy to the darkness of deceit.I can't recommend this movie to anyone for these reasons...."
2,Problems with Packaging,"Just like many others, I was disappointed upon opening my Rambaldi box to discover that every disc in the set (beside the bonus disc in its hidden compartment) was deeply scratched. With today being Thanksgiving, I haven't been able to contact Amazon to see about securing a replacement, but I will be attempting this soon. It's a shame that greater care wasn't taken when designing the individual season holders inside the main package (which is quite impressive itself). For a limited edition item, this leaves much to be desired, even though the show held within should rate much higher than the rating I've given this set. Buyer beware, and check your discs as soon as you receive this item!"
1,Scratched and Worthless,"I my husband bought me this set as a gift for Christmas, and I couldn't wait to open it. When I did, I found that the entire set was scratched and dirty. I haven't been able to watch a single episode. I am so disappointed."
5,Best TV Series Ever!!!,"Even though this series began in 2001, it's incredible to see how well it is done, even now. The actors are phenomenal! I've never been addicted to any TV series but Alias was able to hook a guy who never thought it possible! The story line is incredible! 10 stars!"
3,Avoid this box set,"While the packaging looks cool and the series is cool there is a major problem with this box set.International Customers of Amazon Beware...... Avoid buying this box set.I purchased in 2007 and while it was advertised as a complete collection.... its not. I am missing a disc but have a duplicate of another disc. After speaking with retailers in New Zealand this is a known fault and problem with this set and most DVD retailers are chosing not to stock this time. What makes it even more challenging for International Customers is the extremely poor returns policy held by Amazon. I have a glorified door stop in my lounge due to the hassles I have been having.Its a real shame, because I really enjoyed watching Jennifer Garner in this series and was looking foward to watching it again.... sadly it is not to be."
3,Great series...,"Alias is and was a great show. Period, end of story. And this box set looks amazing. However, I gave it three stars because this box set is in limited release and is making people who have loyally bought the dvd's of previous seasons rebuy them in order to get the special features not included anywhere else. Buema VIsta seems to be forgeting those of us who have watched and loved the show from the beginning and who have helped keep it alive (and bought the dvd's etc). It just feels like I (and many others) are getting the bird from the people producing this set."
5,Happy customer here.,Ordered and delivered via standard delivery halfway across the world (New Zealand) and it arrived earlier than expected and was in perfect condition. Either they have lifted their packaging game or I got lucky but it was shrink wrapped to a base and then placed in larger carton so potential damage was minimised. Happy with the presentation as was the person I had bought it for as a gift.
5,so far so good,"The set was not scratched, not even a tiny bit. With care and no unnecessary jostling the set should last forever. If it starts to get scratched I'll simply store the discs in a envelope. I am not sure but i am guessing that the carriers who shipped these sets to individuals probably threw the boxes around. It is a flaw but it says more about the shipping habits of the carriers than anything else. My wife bought me mine at Borders and it is flawless. As for the series, I have never seen a single episode so I'll add more to this when I get through some of it. I have only heard great things and from many people who's opinions I trust."
4,Good Value For What you Get!!,I got this for my Husband for Christmas...and He loved it. We had already seen the whole series but it's fun watching it again and trying to pick up on all the things that we missed. It Also comes in a really neat box.
5,Ultimate Set for the Ultimate Series,"This collection is much better than I ever expected. The box is some kind of embossed ""gold."" The inside is a type of red velvet. All the seasons are neatly packaged, and look for the bonus disc in a secret compartment! This is a beautifully designed and detailed artifact worthy of my favorite show, Alias. I began watching it, sadly, in its last season. Watching these seasons marathon-style is satisfying indeed! If you're a fan of LOST, Smallville, or 24, you will love Alias. It's better than all! You won't be disappointed."
2,Great Show Horrible Packaging,I received this as a birthday gift and was concerned due to the fact that so many others had issues regarding scratched discs. Upon opening the box and examining each disc I noticed all mine were also scratched and marred as well which is a shame since the box design is cool. I figured since so many others had the same issue what was the point of exchanging it as I would probably just get another defective item. I then sent all my discs to be professionally repaired and cleaned and this corrected most of the issues although that cost me almost $80. I just cannot believe that a product this expensive could be this defective and as such highly recommend buying the individual seasons in lieu of this.
1,"Years later, it still has the same awful packaging!","My boyfriend bought me this set a few years ago. My excitement quickly turned to disappointment when I saw that all of the disks were scratched and/or dirty, and many were unwatchable (as many, many other reviewers have noted). This year he spoke to someone at Amazon who informed him that the packaging had been redesigned, so he bought me the set again. It went back immediately, as the packaging was the same and once again all disks were scratched/dirty. I am now purchasing each individual season in the normal DVD packaging. DO NOT BUY this item, the problem HAS NOT been resolved!"
3,Alias the Complete Series,"Poor product manufacturing! Had to return 4 disc's of the 29 disc set due to bad scratches. Upon viewing series (only viewed 16 disc's so far) I have come accross 2 more disc's that do not show any damage but has frame freezes!I have no idea how many more there like those untill I view them.Amazon was good to replace the first 4 disc's (had to receive a whole new set to replace the 4 damaged disc's?)and return the old set?The series itself is great, I watch as mutch as I can when I can (takes alot of time to watch 105 episodes (29 disc's).Alias - The Complete Collection (Seasons 1-5 + Rambaldi artifact box)"
1,Double?,"I decided to buy this product new to avoid scratches and other complications. Nevertheless, every single disc I have watched so far is scratched or covered in glue. Not one disc has been able to play properly. But how do you return a DVD once you've opened the plastic packaging?? Either no standards have gone into making this DVD or I got a used DVD that was re-wrapped. I am not very impressed.While the show itself is awesome and incredibly addictive, the format makes it frustrating to watch. If I could go back, I would not have bought this DVD. I'd rather buy a PVR and record re-runs."
2,Not up to par...,"I love Alias and I had great expectations when putting a lot of money into buying the dvd box set - I bought it new off amazon and it came to my house with the box bent and half the dvds didn't play well at all, they skipped and the picture quality was terrible in spots. The 2 stars is from the quality that I received initially. However, I was able to return the box and get a brand new one (which is on its way!) and the people at amazon were awesome and amazing during the exchange process. I just hope my new box set is really new and I know that it will be a great improvement on the last."
3,great show poor packaging,"Ok the box is great, beautiful, etc.... BUT ALL the dvds were scratched when they arrived, due to the bad packaging of the box. The discs are in cardboard sleeves which scratch the discs. I had to make paper sleeves for all of the dvds.... But fortunately, I can read them all, which is a good thing since I bought the box from France and I didn't know how to return it.And one more bad surprise... I had to pay 30 more euros because of the customs.... So if you buy this box from France as I did, prepare yourselves for a little more expensive set...Apart from that, the box is really really great and the show fantastic! Enjoy!"
5,AMAZING BOX SET!!!,"Awesome show, amazing package, you get a sweet box and all of the episodes of Alias with special features, it's perfect."
5,A DREAM COME TRUE,"It is made of shiny cardboard so that picture is misleading, but it's awesome!I didnt own any season so I bought this and am totaly satisfied. The discs were in good condition, although it looks as if they could be damaged. But I'm sure for this price and for the fact that youre and Alias fan, the amount of care you take will ensure their safetyYAY I LOVE THIS THING"
2,Mostly disappointed,"Most of the dvds were scuffed/scratched. As a result, I had to skip ahead and then rewind to the spot where the video froze quite often. I can't help but wonder if this wasn't re-packaged."
3,"Nice, but lacking","This is a very small book and does contain many Christmas carols. But there were some that I had hoped would be included that were not. There was a little information about the included carols, but not a lot. I didn't take the CD out."
3,SO-SO,"It's just OK. It's REALLY small and doesn't contain much information in it. There are some errors as well. One of them is saying that Handel composed THE MESSIAH. It is not THE Messiah, it's just MESSIAH. I think more research could have been done on a book that small."
4,I have been suffered from diabetic complication.,very useful and convenient book for home medical guid
4,great reading,"I read this book a few years ago and all I can say is that I never put it down till I had finished it. It really spooked me. If you are into horror books and love reading about demon posession, then this book is perfect. It is about this girl called Mary who is posessed by this demon and this priest who is the exorsist. Many things in the book are sure too keep you up awake at night pondering. If you liked the movie the exorsist, then you have to read this book. I have read bloodline by the same author which is also very good."
3,Depnds on What Your Intent is.,"I have had this machine for a year now. I believe it is the best of the ""Abs Lounge design"" evolution to date. But what do you want it for? If you want to make your stomach muscles sore and strengthen them, it will do that like nothing else I know of - considering the minimal effort required by the user to achieve such results. However, if you want to loose your ""gut"", loose weight in general, or loose the love handles - Don't waste your money. It alone just cannot do that. Diet and cardio exercise in your ""zone"" (for a minimal time of 20 minutes per day) are the only healthy choices for achieving that goal. I wish there was another way, but despite the billion dollar industries that all want to sell you ""something"" claiming otherwise - its just not gonna happen.However, if you do not believe me, email me and I will gladly sell you mine at a super discount. It is in great condition and is currently part of my ""failed weight-loss equipment"" museum downstairs."
1,Drill bit broke,"Had to open up 8 holes with it through metal, the bit was dull on the 4th hole and broke in half on the 7th hole. Wasn't expecting the highest quality part so it got the job done I suppose, just don't plan on keeping it in your toolbox for years to come."
5,Move Over Just A Little Kinky Friedman,"Sam Hill is a terrific writer, and very clever. His characters are unique and the story extremely entertaining. I started with Buzz Riff, will now read the first in the series, Buzz Monkey, and can't wait for the next Buzz Book! Buzz on Mr. Hill. Buzz on."
1,Router Bit Set,"Bits were metric, rather than inches, and easily broken. Basically, you got a box with bits of limited usefulness."
3,Cute but hard to interpret,"The designs in this book are very very cute. I can't wear them (except the bathrobe, which I do plan to knit for myself) but I have a step-daughter who can, which is almost as good.I give it only three stars as I am attempting to knit the Blue Suede Bikini and am finding the instructions to be very poorly written. At this moment I am literally drawing the design out on graph paper to discover where the lace pattern would lie and how the increases should work. The instructions for the construction of the bottom from crotch to the back are particularly obtuse.I am not a beginning knitter but I've had to rip out several times before I resorted to graphpaper.I do hope to see more from Ms. Paige but I hope that she is able to improve her directions."
3,I'm not sure the frustration is worth the effort,I loved the patterns in the book and bought it on the spot. There are however alot of errors in the patterns that can be overcome with alot of patience and work which is an annoyance when the book cost thrity something dollars new when I got it. I have written the publisher and the artists website but have yet to hear from either. The book offers great starts to wonderful projects that you will spend alog of your own time trying to figure out because her instructions are wrong at some point. I have still made a couple of the peices however and have been very happy with them once I finally figured out what in the world I should do to make it work. I would not recommend this to a beginning knitter at all. They will get frustrated... I still am.
1,"""Sexy Little Knits""",This book is full of Errors. Period. Save yourself $22.00 and countless hours of frustration. Boycott the Author- Boycott the Publisher- Boycott the store that you bought it from. They are all shameless!!The world is full of cute and striking Patterns provided by responsible Authors and Publishers. Ashley Paige and Potter Craft do not fall into this category.
2,Beautiful Designs - Horrible Patterns,"There are so many beautiful patterns in this book including a luxurious bathrobe, a number of the gorgous retro bikinis Ashley Paige is famous for, and some really cute tops and skirts.Most of which come with horrid patterns that are nearly impossible to create. It's beyond typo errors, it feels more like whole sections are missing. Having knitted by hand and with a machine, it feels like these patterns were made for a machine and then translated for hand knitting but never actually tested. Maybe one day they will come out with another book called ""Sexy Little Knits: with Actually Knittable Patterns."""
2,Must Be Brazilian Supermodel to Wear...,"I consider myself someone who would be able to wear the things out of a book called Sexy Little Knits...but these designs are ridiculous! I would keep this book away from my little brother and nephews, too, because the photography is like getting your hands on a Victoria's Secret catalog, and a little too much for even me. I would say that the little hot pink number on the front is one of the most tame and wearable designs. I read other reviews like the one I am now writing, and didn't heed their advice because I thought perhaps middle-aged women were trying to wear these and getting upset that they couldn't. Public apology...these knits are for no one but a tan leggy teenager (who can ostensibly knit her own dainties!)"
5,Not your ordinary knitting book!,This book speaks of the unspeakables in polite society. As a knitter with severe allergies to everyday things one can make sure they are properly clothed in materials that they may not be able to but in the standard market.
1,Designed by Fredericks of Hollywood,"I am a thirty-something, pretty hip, pretty shapely Californian, and there is not one pattern in this book that I would wear, let alone spend the time knitting. ""Sexy"" is a misnomer -- ""trashy"" would be better. I was hoping for some non-dumpy-looking sweaters and flattering garments, and instead I got see-through tops, peek-a-boo swimsuits, and bare midriffs galore. The only person I know who has the body to get away with this stuff is my 14-year-old niece, and her mom wouldn't let her out of the house wearing anything in this book! Save your money. Wrap yourself in cellophane and save yourself the trouble of getting out your needles."
4,Sicilian Combinations,"While it is true this book is essentially a book of 500 combinations there are a couple interesting aspects to it that previous reviewers have overlooked.1) All combinations come from ""Sicilian"" openings and list ECO in the answers...while for the beginning player this might not matter, it is worthwhile to study patterns and ideas from openings that you play.2) The problems have been checked to insure there are no ambiguous alternate answers....which is a common problem in chess tactic books...nothing worse than banging your head against a problem where your idea is equally legitimate or better. Lishvits's Test your chess comes to mind....Aagaard has an enjoyable writing style, and aims to an audience somewhere between Silman and his excellent primers on strategy, and Dvoretsky and his world class books."
2,Another puzzle book,"The previous reviewer is correct; the book is merely a collection of combinations problems taken from master play. A plethora of such books already exist, and there is nothing in Aagaard's book to distinguish it from the competition."
5,Fantastic,The Anolon Sure Grip Bakeware 9-Inch Round Cake Pans I purchased are fantastic. I have been a long time user of Analon Products due to their superior quality.
5,Love cookies,This has some great old recipes that I remember from the first cookbook that I used when I was about 8 years old. (It's been a LONG time since then). They are great tasting and lovely on a serving dish. Good buy.
5,Jeffrey Osborne & Lenny Williams,"This cd is two scoops of wonderful from two very talented artist. Its short & sweet. It may not be a full course meal but its certainly a great appetizer. The cd features 5 songs from Jeffrey Osborne..Don't stop...On the wings of love..Congratulations.. Stay with me tonight.. and You should be mine(the woo woo song). There are also 5 songs from Lenny Williams.. Choosing you.. Ooh child.. Shoo doo fu fu ooh.. Since I met you.. and the one that I love most..Cause I love you! Naturally these artist have way more songs, and there are probably more extensive music cds from both artist available, but if you want a nice sample addition of some of their greatest songs this is nice to have."
4,Very Good Collection,"Two of the Best Vocalists over the past 30 years. Lenny Williams just for ""Cause I Love You"" Alone is timeless. I can listen to that song all day.I enjoy his vocal runs on his songs here though I dig his Tower of Power songs a bit more,but he had a nice run as a Solo Artist. Jeffrey Osbourne:always dug his solo career. I use to listen to his first two Solo Albums all the time&still do. His range is no joke. powerful&Direct.would have liked more tracks on here,but this is still a very good collection."
2,the jewlery is meh,Very small... Its pretty but you cant tell what it is unless you already know or look at it close up
2,What's the point?,"I was very interested in reading ""Palladian Days"", after seeing the Gables written up in a magazine. Their very interesting and unusual story certainly deserved to be featured in a book. Although the story of their life in this magnificent home held my interest, I was very, very disappointed that Mrs. Gable chose to use her book as a forum to air quite a condescending attitude toward the former owners. This was not alluded to once, or even twice, but was a sub-theme throughout the book. What is the point of this? It came across arrogant, superior, and frankly, rather than siding with Mrs. Gable, I wondered what about her as person would cause her to stoop to such a low level. None of her readers care about hearing her shovel the dirt, but she made a point of highlighting it repeatedly nonetheless. Not too classy, and certainly a huge detraction from an otherwise good story. All I wondered at the end was, ""What is her agenda????"""
2,Mildly entertaining but a big missed opportunity...,"Some people have stories to tell but do not realize the bigger story in their own story. I would say the author missed the story. There is so little of anything to do with Palladio - it's all about the Cornaros (Venetian Rockefeller types in their day) and eternal family lines. And the author's own aspirations for her family to be as dynastic (and own the villa for the next 200 years - very unlikely fairytale). One wonders what the author is really doing buying this house - trying to make her own family into a dynasty? That's what it sounds like sometimes. I listened to the audio version of the book.Bottom line: The personal story is of some interest, but the star of the show - Palladio - gets very short shrift in this book. Alas. What could have been."
2,not again....,"Please don't shoot the messenger/ reviewer, but when I find something bad, I just can't say otherwise.....Remember those little photo albums titled Grandma's Brag Book? Palladian Days is somewhat like one of those without the cute pictures. At first these memoirs of expat life in foreign locales were charming and fun, but by now they've been done to death. In this audio version, the narration is performed by the author, Sally Gable, in a not very professional manner. While this volume contains some interesting detail in places, it's just too long and full of labored metaphors and weak jokes. I think if this had been one of the first of this genre that I'd picked up, I might have found it charming. But how many of these can you read and still find fresh?"
4,Tarps a Tarp,Works great we have used it for camping under the tent and as an impromptu shade for the sun and truly sweltering afternoons in the Blues....
1,Wogaman couldn't think his way out of a paper bag.,"If you appreciate ""cheap grace"" and relentless feel-goodism, this is the book for you, but for real commentary on the Clinton scandal that gives a less partisan angle, try Judgment Day at the White House."
1,With friends like these . . .,"I'm a democrat, and no fan of the either the Republicans or the president, but I've got to say, this rambling, incoherent defense of Clinton actually ends up making the case for impeaching Clinton. And frankly, I was shocked that a Pastor would interject himself into a political debate and label his political opponents' actions as immoral.In two words: shockingly dull."
2,Looks very cheap,"This looks much prettier in the picture. I had initially bought it for a friend for Christmas, but ended up giving it as a gift to my eight year old daughter. It almost looks like something you would find in the toy department. I have ordered other jewelry from Amazon and loved it, so one dud is not bad."
3,Warning! Major bug on this game!,"This is an outstanding game which is tainted by a major bug nevertheless. Throughout the game, Rynn leaves her dragon to explore caves. However, on a cave in the Northlands which connects two sections, if you enter it without the dragon (as you do before multiple times because the dragon doesn't fit), you lose the dragon PERMANENTLY and have to start over the game from the very beginning! This unless you have multiple saves, which can take up a lot of space (1.5 mb). I didn't so I lost over ten hours of gameplay!This bug was patched on the European release, but not on the American release. Bugs like this can slide on PC games, but on a console game you are stuck with them and are unacceptable."
2,Bugs-But Great Game,"Yes, this game is great, yes I spent hours on it, but YES there are A LOT of bugs. Everything from critters that you have to kill being ""lost"" in mountains or hills, to losing your dragon, to completing a quest and the fact that you completed the quest never registering to the game. All of these can take place in the first minute or the last minute of the game. Thus loosing HOURS and having to replay or burn the game. It is a shame that something with this much potential was sped through the process."
2,Drakan: the Ancients' Glitch,"As a previous reviewer mentioned, there is a major glitch in this game. Your dragon can completely disappear. However, unlike the other reviewer, my dragon disappeared in front of my eyes never to be seen again. I called him, he came, I dispatched a monster, and the dragon was gone. There was no tunnel involved, and no way to get him back. How did this game ever hit the shelves?Play at your own risk. I know I'm done with it."
5,Flying high and soar with a dragon.,"This is one of my all time favorite games, ever since it came out. I love the adventurous RPG playing of this game, how you can upgrade your armor and weapons...but that is not the best part. You get to ride a beautiful red dragon called Arokh, and it is always nice to have a pet dragon...you know like for BBQ's and help light your campfire's for roasting Marshmallows. No Just Kidding with you. No But seriously this is a great game, Predating the graphics of Ps3..but still a real Joy to have."
4,I love this game,I played the frist game on computer and loved it this came out and now I love this game the dragon riding is the best part with some role playing things here and there some times it dose slow down a bit but nothing too bad get this its like tomb raider on a dragon
3,Fun Game,"A decent game, Not the greatest work on the PS2 but a worth addition and compelling story. Worth at least a single play through."
4,"Tomb Raider meets DragonHeart, and totally kicks butt...!","When I first fired up I could'nt believe the details in the characters and world, personally I hav'nt seen a game that comes close to this well apart from maybe Final Fantasy but this is a different kind of thing. I thought it was pretty fast considering the amount of stuff on screen and I loved flying on the dragon he had lots of control and good weapons, again I think theres much detail from the characters thru to the weapons and further to the spells ect it adds so much more than just fly..shoot..fly..shoot..now you have a larger arsenal than before so I think if the full game keeps this up most people will find it exciting from what I played on the demo and read about it I highly recommend it."
3,Room for Improvement,"I had high hopes for this game when I first began. The graphics are wonderful and the sound is great. Technically, there are a few bugs with the game, but most of these can be overlooked. The major flaw with the game si the way the story is carried out. There is barely enough of a plot to move the character from area to area. The ending needs the most work of all. After beating the entire game, it was very dissappointing."
3,"Draken amost failed me, but it's fun to play","I played the demo of Draken and it was fun, so thats were i wanted this game. The game over all is fun but i did have truble near the begaining of the game in the ""showdow mire."" not a fun place to be. And there is Spiders! and i really don't like spiders but there is only 2 places i 100% know that there are spiders. Enoghf of that, i like dragons so thats fun riding on a dragon. the game is long, and the story line is good. But the ending could be better. the skill system is differnet because you can only have 12 skill point to put on your chariter so you can have a strong point and a weak point or you you can be balnced. Overall Draken is a O.K. game."
5,It works on Linux too!,"I was a little worried that it might not work on Linux (SLED 10), but it does! Love it!"
5,Great Product,I purchased 3 of the Interlink VP4150 RemotePoint Navigator 2.4's for our department. Faculty love using this. It was a great price and easy to use. I have had one of the faculty purchase one on her own after using the departments. Highly recommend.
5,No Drivers Required and MEGA EASY to operate!,"This unit is my favorite because the professors that use it can't ""screw it up"" :) It's back button actually takes you back in the powerpoint instead of being a right mouse click like some advancers use. Also it requires no cd or anything to install before the unit will work. And it works at very long range. I love this unit and highly recommend it. Interlink's upgrade to this has a joystick that works like a mouse, but it doesn't work well and complicates the issue for the users. So this is the one I recommend."
5,Great Little Device,"Prices continue to drop so shop around. This little devil is great. I use it all the time for presentations. Watch out if your computer is in a cabinet, so that when you close the cabinet door it doesn't bang the transmitter you plug into the front of the computer."
4,"So far, I would buy it again","I bought this remote pointer for a self-titled technology-impaired person in my office who hasn't had it long enough to rate battery life, longevity, etc., but this person raves about its ease of use compared to the previous product he'd been using."
5,Great for Needy Faculty,"I have tried out a number of presentation remotes and this product is the best I have found. While it does not have all of the bells and whistles of other remotes, it is also foolproof. I have to support dozens of faculty members at the college that I work at, and each faculty member has a different skill level. The simplicity of only having 4 buttons means that anyone can use it. Even the faculty that are afraid of technology do not seem to have trouble using this.The range is fantastic and the battery life is pretty good. I have 7 of these units permanently located in classrooms and even with all that traffic I have not had a single unit fail in 3 years. This unit doesn't require drivers so it is easily installed, even into a visiting laptop.The only problem I have had is that sometimes I will get the transmitters and receivers mixed up, and have to re-sync them. Each remote has to be synced to a specific receiver, but once this is done it remembers even when unplugged."
5,"Spanish Metal, from Spain","The best of Spain Metal, great sound, an lyrics. this cd contains the best songs of Angeles del Infierno, If you want to know buy It."
2,ESPN NBA 2Night 2002,"This game is not the best basketball game out! I rented it for 5 days and it got very old! I would not recommend this game because you can hit the three too many times and win too badly.I liked the ""NBA 2k3"" game and the ""NBA Live"" game a lot more because they are more challenging and have better graphics.Bottom line: this game stinks!"
1,dont get this,"this game is was alright at first, i enjoyed winning but that gets very old. The create a player is horrible. You can not have any detail with your player, as compared to live when you have many details. And what is with bo outlaw winning mvp every year? He is washed up and is a horrible player! That shouldnt happen. and the gameplay is not very great ethier. It dhould have the regualar controls like the Y button as block or rebound, not in this game. so i recomened you save your money and dont buy this, or go buy nba live 2003 or 2002, they are worth the money, not this game isnt."
3,Not enough for the price,"This book has a good explanation of the ins and outs of forming an LLC. However, in most cases, you create an LLC by filling the blanks in a state form, and then optionally create an Operating Agreement by filling in the blanks in a sample version included in the book.The value of this book is in the state-by-state reference and in the sample Operating Agreement (and accompanying explanations). It doesn't tell you much of anything about what else you need to do to start a business or run it, referring you to other books written by the author.Given the relatively light content, I wouldn't have expected it to be on the high end price range of Nolo's offerings. The book's real value for me was filling in some gaps in Nolo's excellent ""Small Business Start-Up Kit for California"" by Peri Pakroo."
3,How do keep up an LLC after the LLC is formed?,"This effectively tells how to start an LLC, but doesn't say much about the little legalities you need to follow after your LLC is formed to keep it protected in limited liablity."
1,Missing CD which was supposed to be in BOOK,"BOOK WAS MISSING IMPORTANT FORM CD AND WHEN I WROTE OR EXCUSE ME TRY TO CHAT WITH AMAZON, BOTH RESPONDERS LEFT THE CHAT WITHOUT HELPING ME AT ALL, THAT IS BADDDDD!!!! I WANT MY CD WHICH GOES WITH THIS BOOK ASAP, PLEASE!! P.S. YOUR FOREIGN ASSIGNED CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE HANG UP ON YOU, DO NOT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH, DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FIX A SITUATION ON CUSTOMER SERVICE, PLEASE FOR U.S. CUSTOMERS, CONNECT TO U.S. ASSISTANCE FIRST?"
4,Quality Product.,This is a very well written book. It is exactly as you'd expect from the advertisement. The shipper was prompt and everything arrived on time and in perfect condition.
5,Excellent resource,"The title of the book is ""How to FORM your own LLC"", not ""How to RUN your own LLC"", and it does exactly what it says: gives you accurate information for forming and filing corporate structure documents for your LLC. I've incoporated two companies with this book, both inexpensively and easily. I recommend it."
4,Form Your Own Limited Liability Company,"Without this book could be impossible for me to form my own LLC company. This book is an excellent tool to form an LLC. This book guide me step by step with all the process necessary to form my company especially with the taxes issue and all the risks that you have to know.Julio C. SalazarDel Rio, Texas"
3,Form Your Own Limited Liability Company,"Straight to the point book, could possibly have more examples of Articles pertaining to Non-profit organizations."
4,Sister Wendy plumbs the depths of prayer,Sister Wendy's images on prayer add a deep dimension to her words. She is a profound prayer who is seeking God in his most hidden dimensions. I loved the first part of the book and it has encouraged me in prayer. I did find her gratuitous endorsement of homosexuality discouraging and unnecessary. The last few chapters are particular to Catholicism and not of interest to me but most Catholics would find them useful.
2,Better books on prayer exist,"A bit disapointed with the book. Some may find it helpful, personally I thought it was lacking in depth, focused on art (art isn't a requisite of prayer) and I finally put the book down when she suggested ""religion"" as unnecessary. As a practicing Catholic I was disturbed that if daily Mass was important enough for her to write this into a contract with a media giant why would it not be an important aspect of prayer advice or council to the interested student. There are better books on prayer, Sr. Wendy lives with Carmelites. Perhaps a prayer seaker might find ""Fire Within: Teresa of Avila, St. John of the Cross, and the Gospel-On Prayer"" by Thomas Dubay a better selection."
4,better than most,"Being a fan of Dave Grohl,Foo fighters and Nirvana I have read every book published on the subjects and nothing new is ever revealed .Most of the material can already be found in magazines already published however Nothing Left To Lose did reveal things about Dave Grohl that had not been revealed before as far as I am aware.The book was very interesting and well written."
5,Love these boots,"These are simply amazing. I wear them everyday. Extremely comfortable, very well made, sexy, unique. Worth every penny. I love that the circumference around the shaft is small, no feeling like I'm swimming in them as most knee high boots do. Because of the side lacing, they can be easily adjusted for wider calves as well. I normally wear a size 8 in most shoes... ordered an 8 1/2, and they fit perfect. I could probably have even gotten a way with half a size smaller. I'm definitely a Fluevog fan for life now."
2,Not Minasi's best work,Outdated and relatively thin even for its time. Mark needs to update completely this volume since his works are some of the most comprehensive and readable on the market.
2,There's better books for beginners,"I really like Minasi's Windows books. I've learned virtually everything I know about Windows from Mark; I only found this book after I had read a number of other Linux books, and I have to say, although there isn't anything drastically wrong with this book, virtually every other introduction to Linux I had read was better than this book. I like Mark Sobell's books and I like Fedora unleashed. The absolute best starting point book I ran accross was Linux Sustem Administration; A beginner's Guide by Steve Shah and Wale Soyinka. After their book you will have enough confidence to run your own machine and enough of a foundation to start looking at deeper more narrow titles."
5,A MUST have for NT/Win2k Network Admins,"Are you tired of Linux books written for former Unix admins? Or ones that constantly knock Microsoft products? (hey, we may not LOVE Microsoft but we usually have to LIVE with it's products). Are you an experienced NT/Win2k Admin? Then this book is a MUST have for your collection.Mark (along with Dan York) attacks Linux from an NT/Win2k point-of-view. As a NT/Win2k admin, I KNOW Win2k/NT file permissions...what makes Linux file permissions different? I KNOW how to set up a DNS/DHCP server in NT/Win2k...how do I set up a LINUX DHCP/DNS server? What makes a Linux web server different from IIS in NT/W2k? Mark/Dan do NOT waste your time re-explaining concepts we already know. Instead, they explain how to do the same stuff we've been doing for years in NT/Win2k in Linux.Even if you're not running any Linux in your present environment, you probably will some day.I highly recommend this book!!"
1,Worst Docs ever made,"When I got these boots I loved them. They were comfy and looked really good after 2 weeks of wearing them the first time it rained, water was getting in the boot from THE BOTTOM. The clear/yellowish rubber separates from the black rubber all over the boot. After 6 months the clear part on the outside of the boot (closest to your smallest toe) had separated completely on both shoes and soon the boots were uncomfortable to wear because the inside of the shoe was falling out of the bottom. I typically keep any pair of shoes 2-3 years before they reach this point. I usually wear Docs for 4 years. DO NOT BUY ANY OF THE 2 tone sole boots. A friend of mine had the exact same problem in even less time because he uses his as work boots."
3,Thorough!,"I purchased this textbook for microbiology for pre-nursing school classes. It was a big help with lots of pictures and information. I made a B in the class, for what that's worth!"
3,Microbiology: A Systems Approach,"I got this book for my microbiology class. As a first time microbiology taker, but is well versed within the sciences, this book can be better laid out. I got it because I had to, and although it is very introductory the the chapters and ideas can be better organized and elaborated on.There is a more recent edition of this book so maybe it will be radically different, but this book is okay. I am a very organized person and so I would like to see that within the materials I read as well. With that said, this book can be better organized, but it gets the job done."
3,Microbiology book,"Make sure before you buy it that you will actually use it. Our instructor found that, while the information in it was accurate, the pictures and other media that came with it were not as good as some other books."
5,A great buy!!!!!!,"I purchased this item online because it was much cheaper that what I would have paid if I were to buy the same book from the school bookstore. IF...I would have purchased this same book in hardback edition from the bookstore, I would have paid $120.00. But since I bought this edition online in soft back edition, I only paid $15.00!!!!!!!! What great buy for the same material!!!The book was ""Microbiology A systems approach"" by Marjorie Kelly Cowan and Kathleen Park Talaro. The McGraw/Hill International Edition"
5,great buy,"I purchased the #71 black cartridge for my Lexmark 125 printer. Received a brand new, factory sealed & in the box Lexmark cartridge, moderate yield. It is exactly the same as the cartridge i've been paying $10 more for at my local Walmart! Great buy & fast ship."
1,Bachmann Trolley,It quit running after only a few times. I was able to return it for a refund but was still out shipping costs.
3,Book Review,"This book is good as a supplement, and is thorough in content. However, it is not good at explaining calculations or how to get them. It would have been helpful to have examples to follow for calculations and questions in ""To test your understanding"" section of the book."
5,Dazzling!,"Normally I hate paying full price for a CD--my collector's mania is so serious I often buy used versions so I can transfer the savings to still more purchases--but this wasn't available in other than the full imported price.It was well worth it. I'd previewed several selections posted on YouTube and had found the 10' long, deep resonance of this cembalo totally seductive. And the playing, as commented on YouTube by some of the cognoscenti, is masterly, seemingly spontaneous, and inspired. The selections, two by composers I'd never heard of, are all first-rate compositions that have stood up to many hearings. Brembeck is obviously a keyboardist of the first rank. I don't collect much harpsichord, but this is a wonderful find."
2,bad quality,"listen, these are not worth more than $2. Blunt, poorly overlapping blades. They crush, rather than cut, hairs. The tips of the cut hairs are visibly frayed after cutting. Definitely not worth the money. Do not recommend."
5,Great little scissors,These scissors are sharp and cut very well. They are a nice weight and seem very well made. Very happy with my purchase and can fully recommend.
5,Mehaz 4 Inch - my opinion,This is a great little scissor. I use it primarily for eyebrows but can be used in other areas of the face. Be careful. Make sure you SEE the tips of the scissor when you cut (as you should with any scissor).
4,Good Scissors for the Price,"Was looking to find a cheaper pair of scissors to trim some facial hair and gave these a try. They work well. I have only had them a short time, so I cannot comment on durability of the blades, but they seem pretty sturdy."
3,Not impressed,"I'm a big guy with big hands and maneuvering these scissors is not easy. That's my review, I wouldn't buy these again."
3,"Good information, but not too ""edge of your seat"" reading","This is basically the business history of the United States (in fact, I read this book for a class entitled that). It traces the story of how the visible hand of management in business replaced what Adam Smith called the invisible hand of market forces. The content is very in depth and only the most serious economic historian would find this a good book to read.The book is divided into the following sections:--The traditional processes of production and distribution (plantations, textile mills, factories, etc.)--The revolution in transportation and communication--The revolution in distribution and production--The integration of mass production with mass distribution--The management and growth of the modern industrial enterpriseIt should be noted that Alfred Chandler, Jr. won the Pulitzer and Bancroft awards for this book."
3,"Good, but dated","This book discusses a variant of the ""theory of the firm"" when applied to monopolistic competition. In a nutshell, how and why does a corporation exist when there are no internal prices for transactions within the corporation (think how corporate department A does not hire department B within the same corporation, so no prices exist, which is sometimes why corporate life for those working there is a waste of time and money)? Also when a corporation is a monopoly, there is no ""invisible hand"" nor ""perfect competition"" but the corporation, within limits, can do as it pleases. The book is a bit dated since it assumed vertical integration (think Ford River Rouge factory) and highly hierarchical organization is the norm, when in fact corporations have become more ""horizontal"" and ""flat"". BTW I have not read this book, but have read other books that refer to this book and can infer things."
4,"Disc One great, Disk two.....so-so....","This is a two cd set, with the 1st cd containing early tunes of the Shadows. They are all here, Apache, Man of Mystery, Midnight, Kon-tiki etc... Good surf stuff and is The Shadows at their best.The second cd are mostly remakes of standards, (Riders in the Sky, God only knows, Imagine etc...). I really like their version of ""Albatross"". The 2nd cd is ""ok"", but I got the ""Shadows are go!"" cd and really, all their best original work is on that one cd. They play the cuts well here, but really...some of it almost sounds like elevator musak.I would not have bought this cd set, knowing that all my favorites of the Shadows were already here from my initial purchase. But there are 50 tunes here and it rounds out the collection.Joe"
1,Bad Recordings,The songs on the two CD's sound like they were recorded before any technology was ever around.I will be giving this to the Goodwill Store
5,Best Choice for New Teachers,I will be graduating this spring with my degree in education. This book has helped me a lot in terms of preparing my cover letter and resume. It also gave a lot practical information about what to expect when starting a teaching career. I found this book to be more useful than general teacher resume books because it includes advice and tips for beginning teachers. This is a good reference book for teachers.
2,Don't Waste the Money,"This book is very elementary, and the resumes are so weak that we refused to add the book to our library for student reference. A good education resume should have much more sustenance than this book shows in its examples. If you want a good resume book specific to teachers and other education professionals, try ""101 Grade A Resumes for Teachers"" by Rebecca Anthony."
1,"If you're looking for something different, this isn't it.","I have to admit, I was not impressed by this book what-so-ever. Honestly, I'm not sure how this book got on the market, the content does nothing for a 21st century teacher. The cover letters are short, simplistic, and unimpressive. The layouts of the included resumes are better suited for the first time job-seeker applying for a position in the service industry (i.e. fast food, grocery store, etc.).Let me tell you, I have just read through four resume books specifically aimed at teachers (this book, the one listed below, 101 Grade A Resumes for Teachers, and Real-Resumes for Teachers). If you want the ultimate book, you should take a look atExpert Resumes For Teachers And Educators (Expert Resumes)."
2,Good Information for New Teachers BUT...,"I will be graduating in May of this year and needed some help with my resume and cover letter. While this book gives you some ideas and examples; the cover letters were very brief and the resumes were short and not formatted any differently. I guess I was hoping to find different ways to format my resume to make it fit on one page, but this book did not provide that.The one thing that I did think was helpful about this book was the section for First Year Teachers. I found that very helpful and had lots of ""do's"" and ""don'ts"" in the classroom."
5,great to start with,this b-daman has ok speed the cannon gives great accurecy and balence and fires marbles at an average speed great for beginners.
4,Matt Wagner did a great Batman story here,"Although Matt Wagner is better known for his Mage comic, Grendel stories and Grendel future universe, he wrote some other good stuff, this one being no exception.Why four stars? I love detective story and this is as close as it can be to Sherlock Holmes stories, and art is real good. You don't have to know who is Dent, who is Batman or whatever, story makes you read it slow and enjoy if you're fan of detective story OR good comic in general."
1,Impressively Promoted But Biased,"According to Lennart P Krook, Paul Connett and Albert W. Burgstahler, Fluoride, 2004;37(3):147-150, this book ""...is a rubber stamp for blatantly biased and often-mistaken official commission and government committee reports that repeatedly deny or ignore serious toxic effects from chronic exposure of humans and animals to fluoride"". Book also ignores absence of any protective effect of fluoridated drinking water on children's teeth, let alone an actual increase in both decay and fractures. Opposition to fluoridation is falsely marginalized as ""...a vocal minority that does not use robust science"".For a less professional-looking, but far more accurate book on effects of fluoridation, see Barry Groves, Fluoride: Drinking Ourselves to Death, 2001."
5,No one's to blame,"The author explains why luck is an inescapable ingredient in human life. He makes clear that this random ingredient is essential if we are to conceive of ourselves as having free will. He eases concerns that bad luck is somehow the result of lack of worthiness and verifies that good luck often is experienced by unsavory people. He establishes that, by its very nature, luck is not controlled by other characteristics or occurrences of our lives, but there are things we can do to fully benefit from the good luck that we do have."
3,Luck Happens,Enjoyable and amusing yarn on the subject of luck! Interesting how some people view their success as a result of their hard work or background while it just might have been that they were lucky? And others were just plain unlucky. Not sure if luck can really be managed according to the author? Sometimes luck just happens!
5,Luxurious Shaving Cream,"Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream is the best if you are using edge or any shaving cream in a can and smearing it on your face with your fingers you are missing out on the true comfort of a luxurious shave. Buy yourself a badger shave brush and lather up with this shaving cream, you only need a little dab and it will turn into an aromatic, creamy lather. Very light and easy on the skin (I have sensitive skin). I also recommend using a little bit of pre-shave oil prior to lathering up, aloe vera oil from a health food store works great."
5,The Best Shaving Cream I've Ever Used,This is by far the best shaving cream that I've ever used. It smells great. It doesn't dry out my face. Small dollops of it can be packed down into a small travel container. One jar lasts for several months.
4,one heck of a game,"wow, this is an awesome game. it lacks the depth of grand theft auto 3, but the plot is there is a revolution going on and you are in the middle of it, basically. the first level is in the mall, where you shoot people, and pick up rather interesting things to kill people with, like kegs of beer, human heads and arms, chairs, caution signs, TV's, etc. its almost like final fight or fighting force gone haywire! this is a great game, and its more like an arcade game than grand theft auto, it has a life-meter like 1 on 1 fighting games...but its fun and just as addciting. grand theft auto 3 and state of emergency while made by the same people and share a similar theme, the games are completely different. check this game out!! its worth it!"
3,dont expect grand theft auto 3,"This game kind a reminds me of an arcade type game. The chaos mode is fun but the revolution mode can get frustrating while your trying to lead or protect the computer ran character's to there destinations,they seem to be on the ignorant side. The chaos mode is fun it's kinda like going hog wild and doing as much damage as possible for the highest scores. The revolution mode can get really old repeating the same mission over and over because of the awful computer controlled character's. Average game i can live with or with out."
1,fun at first,"this game is a rental. dont buy it, rent it. its a lot of fun at first, but the missoins are very repetitve. i was very dissapointed, and i sold it to a friend 2 days after i bought it, i ripped him off."
4,Pretty Cool Game,"State of Emergency should be another sure fire hit from Rockstar games. It is non stop chaos and violence, and certainly isn't appropriate for young gamers. This game kind of reminded me of a 3D Smash TV, but the difference is, you can blow up store fronts, and cars in the parking garage, and you have a wide assortment of cool weapons, meanwhile running around in a large 3D environment.SOE is a little repetitive at times, but it is easily a game that you can fire up, and play for 15 - 20 minutes and get plenty of enjoyment out of, especially when you don't have an hour or two to invest in a game. This game is no where near as deep as Grand Theft Auto III, and its not supposed to be.SOE is a fun little 3D shooter/beat em up with no other quest other than kill or be killed. The graphics are great, and overall its a pretty fun game. I have a good time with it, and I think you will too!Recommended!!"
2,Lots and lots of violence but in reality a repetitious game,"It is like they thought if they make it as bloody and violent as they could it would sell...and I guess they are right. Once you get past the fact that you can mow down a crowd with a AK 47 or chop someone's head off or break their leg and arm there is not much to this game. It plays like this...walk around beating/shooting/stabbing...gangs and the police/corporation and doing silly missions like escorting characters, killing heavily armed/protected business men and things of that nature. You cannot drive ANYTHING...The weapons are pretty cool, as is the fighting action...but the story and actual depth of the game is not all that at all...GTA3 was 100% better...RENT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT!"
2,Throwaway,"I should have rented before I bought. The graphics aren't that great, the levels are tiny, and the missions are just busy work. Clearly, they had different objectives for this title from GTA3, but in the end, this is just less fun. Keep your money."
3,"Its fun, but could be better","The game play is fun, but its deffenatly not as good as GTA3, the reason it isn't is because unlike in GTA3 you don't have the same freedom to just go anywhere in the city, that part [is not good]. You have to play in levels. The graphics are good along with the controls, but it could have been better, this is why I have given it a 3 star ratng, but my friends think its better than I do, so get a second opinion, all of us thought it was not as good as GTA3 though"
2,Buy it...if you've never played Grand Theft Auto 3,"The title for this review pretty much says it all. I have GTA 3 and I think is on of the best game i've ever played.I saw the TV commercials for State of Emergency...saw that it was from Rockstar and without hesitating I bought the game.I really was dissapointed when I started playing the game...The intro was great, but when you start playing you see that the game is VERY, VERY different to GTA 3.When you go out on a mission, there's only text displayed on the screen...no movie or animation...very, simple....Your mission...kill everybody, basically..thats why I think they are asking now for your ID when you buy it.So research the internet about this game...ask around, read reviews...and please skip this game if you think it would be similar to GTA 3."
2,This is not even CLOSE to GTA3,"I wanted to take this game back after about the first 25 minutes of playing it, but I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and see if it got better with time. Sadly, it did not. The graphics are mediocre, the music is terrible, and the missions are both frustrating and boring. The only slightly fun thing about the game is the CHAOS mode where you can randomly mow down innocent civilians with a chain-gun, but even this gets boring pretty quick, as the same people just keep reappearing. It's very sad, considering how great GTA3 was. I hope Rockstar Games releases GTA4 soon to get the bitter taste of ""State of Emergency"" out of our mouths."
2,BORIng & monotenous,its cool for 15 minutes but its sooooo boring the same shi* u do all thru the game beating up cops people or anything when u get a gun its soooo hard to aim @ the pigs man trust me dont but it i wasted my loot & feel stupid just rent it 1st & see & great disapointment for me & i ask ROCKSTAR to hurry & make a sequel to gta or max payne.
3,GTA 3's little brother tries his darndest,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting it to be as intense as GTA3 by any means, but there was that little voice in the back of my head that tricked me into thinking is was going to be. Unfortunately State of Emergency falls short of the bar set by its predecessor. I don't mind the graphics at all being that they are very cartoony. The gore is still there which is nice. What really gets me I guess is that you can't go into any of the buildings. When I was reading the hype about this game they were talking about how you could loot and steal stuff. The best you can do is break building windows and your best bet for getting a TV is to steal it from somebody already carrying one. And as for the cars, don't get your hopes up, you can't drive them in this game only smash them."
4,Great Game for the Right Person,"If you're looking for plot or ""assignments"" a la GTA3, you're looking in the wrong place. However, if you enjoy a game in which you can blow someone's head off and use that head or another body part to attack other people, do buy this game.I really enjoy State of Emergency! :DYou really can't compare this with GTA3, because it doesn't come close. (I mean, if you take away the car element of GTA3, that cuts out an entire dimension of that game.) SOE is a lot more like Crazy Taxi in the sense that it doesn't have as much depth. For instance, I wish you could go inside the stores in the mall. Also, there are no interim movies as there are in GTA3.I don't think those factors detract from this being an excellent game. It's hypnotic! Unlike my frustration with first-person shooters, SOE is very easy to play, and the motivation to play comes from having to work for more options, like in SSX Tricky."
5,I was writing reviews without getting the game,"You probably know me by now,i've already written 2 reviews (actually the second one was just a question) on this game. I kept on writing reviews,but actually I didn't get the game yet. I just played it once at my friend's house,that's when I saw the game and said:WOW!!!THIS IS THE GAME I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS!!!! I told my mom and she ordered it here at this website right away. Then,every single day I checked the e-mail and stuff to see if it finally shiped,but it never did. Until my mom checked the e-mail and saw a message that said that it didn't ship until Monday(that is the 22 of December)so I got anxious and nervious at the same time. Until today(it did come the 22 but my mom wanted to keep it for the 25)I finally opened it and I can't get away from the screen. I'm sorry I didn't really write about the game,but if you wanna hear my oppinions about this game read my first review the one that says:from a 10 year old gamer."
2,Horrible!,What a terrible game. The whole point of this game is to loot stores and cause chaos without getting caught or killed. There seemed to be a lot of hype surrounding this game because of its violent nature but that died down when people realized that it was boring. There's only so many times you want to do the same thing over and over. Don't bother with this game.
2,Lack of Urgency,"After playing and completing GTA3 I went looking for the next ""near perfect"" game. I was told by a few game stores that the makers of GTA3 said that ""State"" was hyped as the next level of game and the elevation beyond GTA3. Well I couldn't disagree more, the game is ok and not horrible. It has some level of fun but I felt it got rather boring rather quickly. The more I played the more I became uninterested."
2,RENT!!! DON'T BUY,"I strongly think you should rent this game, but don't buy it. It literaly gets boring after a 1/2 hour. It also makes your brain hurt,... It's a fun game to play, but only for 30 minutes, at the most. DON""T BUY IT, I REPEAT DON""T BUY IT!"
2,State of Bad Camera Angles,"Take Grand Theft Auto 3--remove the cars, remove the great soundtrack, make the missions tedious and screw up the game camera, and you have State of Emergency.There's some fun to be had--blowing up stuff, sending an explosive rocket into a crowd of people, scrambling away from a mob of club wielding guards, etc. However, poor mission design and a game camera that doesn't cooperate (e.g., you're firing a maching gun and the camera faces you rather than your oponents, forcing you to shoot at enemies you can't even see) make this a game to skip. Get Grand Theft Auto 3 instead."
1,All hype but no pipe,"...But in and of itself, the game has no real value. The gameplay is shallow and predictable. The missions are lame and the same.... All the characters are lame and have no real depth, the story is pointless and suffers from ""been there done that"" deja' vu. It's hard to get into and thanks to the cheat codes it would be impossible to keep up with. The people running around and looting all day get's old after 4 hours. I guess the developes don't expect people to play the game but 20 minutes at a time. After awhile you wonder, where are all these people coming from and how ca they still be looting 3 hours into the game? It gets old fast because the environment never changes, all the level look and feel the same. If they had a clock in it where day and night creat changes... then maybe it would be interesting... because this game is boring and dull...."
2,Not much replay value,"Basically I agree with most of what has been said already, this game gets old pretty quick. The missons are repetitive and pointless and to be honest this games gives you a headache after awhile. It doesnt have the carefully thought out missons and strategy of a GTA3 nor does it have the graphics of GTA3. It looks like a game that Rockstar threw together in a short time and threw onto the shelves, very dissapointing. There are 2 modes; Chaos, which is basically you running around shooting cops, breaking windows, and shooting weapons in an effort to score as many points as you can in 3 minutes, and Revolution mode, which consists of several pointless missons that get old real quick. After Max Payne and GTA3 this is a letdown for fans of Rockstar games, but I guess everyone deserves to have a bad day. Maybe next time..."
3,its fun... while it lasts,"anyone who has played or even tried this game knows that it is fun. there is no doubt about that. but it is an extremely short game. me and my friend beat it in under a day. anyone looking for a long game look to final fantasy X but if you want a fun, short game, look to this."
3,Not as good as the hype...,"First of all, let me say I can't believe that there are 20+ reviews on this game and most of them are saying ""it should be good"". Wait until you own the game before you write a review on it would you. It just adds to the hype that will undoubtedly push this game to the top of the sales chart.This game is not as good as expected. The control stinks as do the missions. The graphics are great but where is the gameplay. It was fun for about a hour but if you need a copy you can find it at EB in St. louis because that is where I'm returnin mine. BTW, I've never played GTA3 so my judgement is not based on partiality to that game.Rent it first.."
2,What's the Point?,"When I rented this game, I was expecting another GTA3 except you get to run around rioting. But what I found was nothing near what I hoped for. Instead of the realistic graphics, weapons, and people like in GTA3, I found a cartoonish world without the graphics and realism of of GTA3. In this game, you just go around rioting. I mean smashing windows, burning buildings and cars, tipping over cars, eveything you'd expect in a riot. Rockstar, you could've done SOOO much better."
2,Get's old fast,this game is fun fo a while than it becomes crap.they should have some story to it but it is only killing which is fun but gets old very fast.
3,"Good for a rent, not for a buy.","I bought this game just because it was from RockStar games. I was VERY dissapointed. I guess I was expecting a game on par with Grand Theft Auto 3. This game is really repeatative, and the screen is WAY too busy. There are CONSTANTLY poeople running around in terror. This game has a decent arcade mode, and is fun for a few hours. There just aren't enough different characters to play with, and not enough different fighting moves. I almost always rent a game before I buy them. I really should have rented this one first. I bought it the first week that it was for sale, and I never even picked up the case after the second week that I had it. This definitely is a good game to rent if you have some friends over, but until the price drops to $ it is not worth buying"
1,gets old fast,"While I love the idea of the game- taking part in a modern day revolution- the game gets old real fast. All you do is go around killing all of the police that you come by, and doing small tasks for those who tell you what to do. You can shoot the innocent bystanders if you really want to (but in a real revolution why would you want to do that anyway?).The point is that in shooter games like Doom, Red Faction, etc. at least other people are attacking you as well. In military strategy games such as SOCOM II and the type, you have to strategize. Killing EVERYBODY you feel like in an extremely overpacked mall (such as level 1) is just kind of childish. So if playing games that have absolutely no real point to them is your gig, have fun kiddies."
2,Doesn't deliver,"Rockstar pulled off the game of a lifetime with GTA3. This time around, they fall flat. Long story short, State Of Emergency looks good, but the controls are retarded, the missions boring and repetitive, and overall, the game gets old--very quickly. I'd stay away from this one."
5,Best Game,This game is the best. I got it when it came out and I love it. There are tom of missions and it is very fun. I think it is as good as GTA3. You'll get hooked. It is cool because you can do stuff like robbing liqour stores or blow up biuldings. And there are a ton of weapons to choose from.
5,awesome,anyone who loves all the GTA games you need to play this game there is so much to the story or you can just not [care] and do what ever you want like shoot civilians or important people the point is that you should play this gamerather on rental or bought.
2,...where have the good games gone?,"If you're expecting something nearly as good as GTA III look somewhere else! yeah, yeah, there are folks who say you can't compare, but it's inevitable!! This game is pretty shallow. Graphics are decent. Pretty standard. Control is iffy. The game is fun for about a day or two but the gimmick wears thin very soon. If you have a choice between GTA3 and SOE just get GTA3. it does what SOE attempts but better. The whole sense of freedom is absent in SOE. No story either. GTA3 set the bar very high and it's a shame that SOE doesn't even come close. Why play SOE when you could just play GTA?"
2,"Rockstar, what happened?","I know this isn't Grand Theft Auto 4, but come on, I was expecting something close to the quailty and overall fun of Grand Theft 3. What I got was a boring and headache-inducing excuse for a game. There are people running all over the screen. This is old news about 20 minutes into the game. The controls are awkward, and worst of all, there is no substance to State Of Emergency--it is boring. Go pick up GTA 3, and ignore this waste of time."
2,Booooo!,"I'm done getting excited by all the hype and buzz about video games by Rockstar. Yes GTA3 was fantastic, but everything I've seen since is poor. State of Emergency is BORING and mindless. The graphics are lame and a 100 rioters running around for no reason is alot less cool than it sounds. Don't waste your $$$. I mean it."
3,Disappointing compared to GTA3,"Given the brilliance of GTA3, I assumed this would be a new and improved GTA3 version with even more free roaming shenanigan's. What we have is an ""arcadey"" cartoonish game with limited freeform. For example, in Revolution mode, you have to complete the assignments in order, each and every time. I'm currently caught in a loop of trying to stop a certain guy and when he escapes I have to start completely over like none of my unsuccessful attempts even happened. This would be fine if I was 10 years old, but I'm not! Then the Catch 22 of the fact that a 10 year old shouldn't be playing this game with all the gore (true you can turn the gore off but what's the fun in that). I expected much more from Rockstar given their truly brilliant GTA3 offering. This is not anything special."
2,"Good storyline, but actual game is boring","I was excited when I first started playing this game. The storyline is pretty cool, I liked the idea of playing as a revolutionist trying to overthrow a repressive government. But after 15-20 min the game fell through. The game is just too monotonous to be of any replay value. I enjoyed the game at first, but the missions are pretty much the same thing over and over. I trudged through the game anyways, just to see the ending. What really annoyed me was the ending! I thought the ending would be interesting, but it was not worth at all. If the game had a good ending, I would have given it more stars. I would not buy this game. Rent it, you can beat it in a few days. After going through the game once, you will not want to do it ever again."
1,Much more than a disapintment,"At first, I thought this game was another Rockstar smash, but after 3 days, I beat the game there was nuthin' 2 do, n da game was wack. I tried other modes, but they got borin' 2 fast. This game is nowhere close to GTA3. The game is fast, and borin'. I ended up tradin' it to my brother for Max Payne. Max Payne was a much bigger hit than this. don't git this garbage, unless u r a big fan of riot games, and end up killin ever1, then rent it. Even GTA 1 and 2 were better than this. Sfter all the screenshots, and the good reviews, I thought this would be great, but it was a 100% rip off. This game is probobly rockstars worst."
1,Stupid and boring,"Well, I rented this game because it was suppost to be like GTA 3.But it isn't. State Of Emergency is trash. All you do is kill people. I got bored after the first 30 min. The music is O.K. but that is IT!!!!! You can't drive around. It is also a lot more violence than GTA 3. You dehead people, blow them up with the grinade launcher and use their blown up body parts as weapons. Don't waste your money on this trash. Rent if first, then buy."
2,I wonder if this game caused any murder rates to go up?.....,"After playing GTA 3, I was so excited about being able to play another Rockstar game....know that it's out and I've played it....I've realized how much it really... There's no point to the game except to go around killing people. Am i the only one who thinks this is boring after 10 minutes?It's like they took one interesting part of GTA 3 and tried to make a whole game out of it minus the missions and any possible plot. This game is a renter, never to be purchased!"
2,This Game Is So Repeative,All you do is run back and forth doing cheap missions and killing people. The gun is bigger than your most of your body and its gets stupid after 10 min. Go rent this game first before buying it. Its a let down for Rockstar games. I thought it was going to be good since GTA3 was great. But no its just a let down not worth the cash.
2,Gets old after a while....,"I have had this game for months now, and I will say that in the beginning it was sickly entertaining. The game made me laugh more than anything. But, after about a month it got really old and somewhat boring. The game is a great one to rent and then forget about it. The replay value on it is horribly low...maybe even in the negatives."
1,Less Fun Than a Home Enema Kit.,"Rockstar really screwed up by releasing this game so soon after GTA3. To make this review really short, I'll say this. Playing Grand Theft Auto 3, then playing State of Emergency is like dating the captain of the cheerleading squad all year, then taking her ugly sister to the prom. I think everyone assumed that since both titles were developed by Rockstar Games, that SoE would emulate GTA3. But there is absolutely no discernable storyline. The characters are unbelievably corny, and the game play is tame and shallow. In fact, a robust game of Tetris has more depth than SoE. Rockstar could have done so much better that it makes me cry."
1,"WAM BAM, Thank you MAM","I bought Grand Theft Auto III, the day it came out and this game is still as entertaining as the day i opened it. I bought State of Emergency the day it came out and WOW, this game stinks, big time, possibly the worst game EVER! .... The game has parts where people you are suppose to protect just die for no reason, when no bad guys are even around. All around if any one reads this revue, shout it from the roof tops, this is the WORST GAME EVER, i'd sell it..."
2,This Game [is bad],I was very dissapointed with this game. After Rockstar came out with Grand Theft Auto 3 I was really pumped to play State Of Emergency. All you do is run around a mall and beat people up or shoot them with the same moves over and over. You are given missions to accomplish but its nothing great. The game became boring to me in about 15 minutes. So you might want to rent it but I do not recomend buying it.
1,Rockstar let us down,I've played the game and I've read the reviews here - 4.5 avg stars is way over rated for this game. The game lacks a lot - it's no GTA3 which it was orignally hyped to be (without the cars) Take GTA3 and take all the stuff that makes that game fun and you're left with SoE. Don't buy this game - if you do you'll feel like you wasted your money. If you don't believe me go to ebay and see what GTA3 is selling for months after it was released and then look at SoE - a LOT less and it was released less than two months ago... case in point
1,Lame. Thats All I Can Say.,"I bought this game thinking it was gonna be like GTA3, they are both published by Rockstar after all. Wrong. This game is nothing like GTA3. I thought you could wander the city as in GTA3. Nope. The game is split into levels. Small ones at that. I cant say for sure tho, i sold the game after playing the first level for about half an hour. This is lame. The controls are too touchy, graphics arent all that great, missions are lame, and there is a timer in chaos mode, so u cant just go around and do whatever u want. Also, from the decriptions, i thought u would be able to break into stores and stuff, nope again, u can break the windows and that is about it. I was thoroughly disgusted with this game. Rockstar should be ashamed of themselves. This has to be one of the worst games i have ever played. Do yourself a favor, and dont buy it."
4,Good game though a bit overhyped..,"Graphics wise, it's nowhere near the quality of Onimusha, Ico, or FFX. The stores and such look rather bland. You can't even enter them so it seems lacking in that you can't raise hell inside the stores as well. However, this game takes off in terms of action once you've got 10 or more gang members/corporation members on your tail and you manage to pick up the shotgun or grenade launcher. There's lots and lots of weapons to pick up from tasers, axes, pepper spray, swords, Ak-47's, Uzis, shotguns, grendade launchers, etc. The action gets intense as you try to accomplish your next mission while you've got bogies on your tail, bystanders in the way, and a loaded weapon in your hands. What to do? What to do? Well, anything you want. That's what. Gameplay isn't very original or deep. It's just basic, mindless fun with replay value accomplished by trying to unlock other characters and areas."
1,"STUPID, have i sayd enough","this game is stupid, its gta 3 w/ another name. o wow 2 modes, revolution and chaos!! people run around getting shot nd bating up, sounds fun, not, its also very frustrating. the graphics are very blocky. this is an unfinished game"
1,Horrible Game,"This game is fun for the first hour. You are excited, expecting something like GTA 3, but it's not like that at all. The missions are so repetitive. Escort the guy there, protect him there, escort him back while getting mobbed by riot police. Kaos mode, where you get points and bonuses for destroying places and killing police is fun because you can earn things (only new places and stuff) with your score and if you enjoy that type of thing it is fun trying to get a higher and higher score. The graphics are pathetic. Wahoo! 200 people are one the screen at once. Thats just stupid because it makes it look horrible and you cant see yourself that well sometimes. But whatever you do, don't buy this, just rent it and then re-beat GTA3."
5,Possibly better than GTA3,"From the looks of the pictures i've seen and the and the company who made this, State of Emergancy could possibly beat Gta3 as the best game ever"
1,Please come up with something original.,"This game can't be that good. It plays around the same concept as GTA3, only the idea is no longer fresh. GTA3 was a great game, but most people have already played it to death. This game will have to be absolutely great, in order to make up for it's lack of originality."
2,"Rent, don't buy.","With ringing denunciations from Sen. Joseph Lieberman and other social watchdogs, State of Emergency looks great on paper. The numerous explosions and cool crowd engine make the game look great in a demo, too. Unfortunately, the game play is ill-thought out. The missions rely on rote memory rather than skill, the set-ups often seem contrived and repetitive.The shoot-em-up Chaos mode is amusing, but the other supplementary games are equally frustrating. The ""Last Clone Standing"" game was a bit disturbing-even for people who like senseless violence as much as I do. The mission of this game is to ""Kill Corporation Clones"" the only problem is that the clones are unarmed, they don't fight back. They cower, they huddle, they run and scream in pain.I can't give any game that includes optional indiscriminate use of a flamethrower a completely bad review, but State of Emergency is a game that, once played, quickly looses its appeal."
2,What a disappointment...,"This could go as the most over-hyped game of the year. What an absolute let-down!! For what was supposed to be such a great game, it is just mind numbingly stupid. Rockstar, how about adding some precision control to this and maybe some cut-scenes and hmmmmm maybe more spoken word? And can we talk about how TEDIOUS it is to run all the way back through the mall once you've failed the task so that you can run all the way back to try the task again?? I will give the game some credit for the amount of onscreen characters, but beyond that....... And I thought the creators were delaying the release to make the game even better. Shame on me. This one is being traded in ASAP."
2,It's no GTA3,"Yup. But it is good at wearing out your thumb. I can imagine how many people will want to buy this game, given that rockstar made the great GTA3. Just don't let the name fool you - this game is just a lot of headache... There's way too much going on on the screen at one time, and it's near impossible to concentrate on the game hero. The game is basically a specialized gta3 (centered on beating people up and breaking things), except it's nowhere near as realistic (you can run straight through people, and the amount of detail is miniscule, compared to gta3).Overall, I strongly recommend renting this game first. Once you do, I'm quite sure you won't want to buy it. Everyone is everywhere at once, and you will find yourself jamming the buttons mindlessly."
4,One of the reasons to own a PS2,This game is so much fun to play. It is alot like a 3-D version of Sreets Of Rage. There are so many weapons to use. The two bad things about this game. Bad Graphics and Repetive Missons.+ Bloody as heckA 3-d version of Streets Of RageChaos ModeAlot of weaponsIntresting charchters-RepetiveRevoultion ModeLevels aren't that bigBad Graphics
1,Not what I expected,"The hype for this game was misleading - the gameplay has nothing to do with rioting, revolution, or anything that requires creativity. You can't interact with the environment. You can do 3 things: break windows, kill people, blow up cars. The missions are repetitive, go get something and bring it back. You can't enter the buildings or cars. The worlds are small and not interesting. It's just a lame button masher where you hit or kick tons of enemies until they're dead. The graphics are OK."
2,Rent it first! For your own good.,"The game is fun for the first hour or so. After that first hour, you've now done just about everything the game has to offer. I bought it, and I wish I had rented it first.Bottom line: descent rental, bad purchase.It gets really old really fast"
4,"Fun game, but not a lot of depth","This is a definitely a fun game, but don't think it's another GTA3. Think of it as Crazy Taxi meets GTA3. You have a fun sort of Chaos mode were you score points from smashing things, blowing up buildings, fighting gangs & killing police. There is also a mission mode were you must complete tasks while fighting off gangs and police. Like I said, it's fun, but there is not a lot to it."
3,A great rental...,"This is the perfect title to rent. It's fun, the graphics are very good. The atmosphere is immersive, you really get a sense of being in the middle of a riot. You get to beat the heck out corporate drones and rent-a-cops. It's a blast...for a couple of days. Unfortunately, the game gets repetitive and formulaic after the 30th ""mission"" or so. This holds true for both the chaos mode and the story mode... Parents who are reading this should be warned: this game is incredibly violent, there is an option to turn off the gore but at it's heart the game is about shooting, stabbing, hacking and beating people to death. Don't say I didn't warn you."
1,This game stinks,"What Rockstar has done is throw together a bunch of mini-games along with an overactive background and try to pass it on as a good game. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE. Within an hour, you will want to sell this game. The missions are braindead. The enemies keep popping back, even though you killed them. All you have to do is turn around and BAM, they're back like nothing happened. The civilians are so annoying... And the areas are small, unimaginitive at best. You can't even explore. It's go from point a to point b, with no reward at the end. Save your money for something more fun."
2,:(,"This game was a big disapointment for me. I have been waiting for this game for a long time only to be disapointed with doing the same thing over and over. The only thing that changes in the game is the setting. All you do is fight and then fight and then fight some more. I would not recommend this game to anyone. In fact, I am taking my back tonight and getting a different game!"
2,How can I say this...,"Please whatever you do--DO NOT waste your money on this game!!! This game is soooo monotonous. I bought it from the store when it first hit the shelves. I got bored with it after about the first 30 mins. I was devastated.SOE has really nice graphics and control, but the story and replay value are sorely lacking! If you just want to run around aimlessly beating and shooting, then by all means, be my guest. Just don't say that I didn't warn you."
4,it was fun while it lasted,"When i rented SoE, it was quite an experience. seeing so many people on one screen with no slow downs was amazing. while the missons sounded cool, (protect stores, destroy buildings, guide people to safe houses.) they kept popping out in later missions. But another down side was i was playing the game so much, i beat the game in 2 days. To sum everything up, its fast paced action yet ends quickly."
1,I got burned [...].,"Do not buy this game! You've probably heard the hype, ""it's made by Rockstar games, the people who did GTA3"".This game blows. There are 4 levels (in the entire game) each the size of a very small quake 1 multiplayer map, with graphics that look downright PS1-ish.The gameplay [is terrible], the missions consist of running to the opposite side of the room to pick something up, and bring it back. yay. it takes about 30 seconds for a mission.Don't get this one.This game is the kind that makes a strong case for piracy."
4,This game is awsome.... BUT ..... DUNCAN E MARTIN,"THE GAME IS GREAT ,THE GRAPHIS ARE GREAT ALSO. BUT THERE IS A LOT OF BLOOD AND KILLING. AND SHOULD NOT BE PLAYED BY THOSE WHO DONT REALIZE THAT ITS ONLY A GAME,"
2,rent don't buy,this game is really fun for about 3-4 hours. gets old quick! wish i wouldn't have bought it!
2,ARRGG!!,"I cant believe bought this game! The minute I put it in and knew right away it [needed help]!! The missions are hella short it's hard to actually shoot people and all you do is punch, kick, and mash buttons. This game would probably be suitable for a ten year old who only knows how to mash buttons! If you dont already have it use the 50 bucks to buy FFX, GTA3, or anything elese! Save yourself!!"
2,Gets old fast,"This game is fun for about 5 minutes, then you realize that you got [a bad deal]. I returned this game the next day and bought a quality title ""Shadowman 2"" which is one of the best games I have played on the PS2."
3,Beat Em Up At Best,"State of Emergency is just a decent game. Nothing better. I would probobally give it a 8/10, a 3.5/5 and so on. Its not that its a bad game because its not. It features tons of onscreen characters at one time, a huge arsenal of guns and weapons and is a throwback to classic games like Double Dragon. The gameplay is easy to get used to and easy to pick up also. The soundtrack is really the quite annoying part- because the sound is really [poor]. Other than the screams of civilians, they really should've put a variety of tunes or had something revolutionary like the car radios in GTA3- maybe like a portable radio tuner? The missions are fun at first- but get repetetive and boring. The chaos mode is fun and will be your main source of fun for a long time. But don't expect GTA3 with this game. While GTA3 was highly addictive, SOE is the total opposite- unaddictive. If your expecting a blockbuster hit- don't buy. You'll be disappointed, or you could love it."
2,a dissapointment in the extreme,"this game is kinda cool, for the first 15 min. After that its pretty darn boring. Its nothing like GTA3, the graphics are more comic bookish and the missions are just plain stupid and uncool. I wouldnt buy this brand new, you'd be better off buying this one used. in fact i've got one if you want to buy it."
4,Great Game,"This is a great game at least I find it lost of fun but there are so many people that have different opinions in my opinion this is a very good fun game quality entertainment. It is Quite a violent game though if you are a parent I dont advise you to buy it for a younger member of society the revolution mode is repetitive but it is long and keeps you playing the game and giving you something to do the chaos mode is tons of fun to play you can go for hours playing and not stop. There is the ability to unlock new characters and other things as you progress which adds extra replay value to the game. Altho it could have used a 2 player mode it is a great game none the less. Be advised I recomend you to rent it before buying, some people just have totally different opinions than others..."

Be advised I recomend you to rent it before buying, some people just have totally different opinions than others"
1,Just doesnt cut it.,"This game is okay at first and you will love the first half hour you play it and enjoy that half hour alot becuase its the only fun you will have with the game. The missions are repeditive, there isnt enough to do, the realism is bad. Stick with GTA3, its the way to go."
2,State of Submergency,"I didn't like this game very much. Sure, it's got violence, and lots of it, but after you get past the gore (granted, it takes a while) then you've got a very shallow game. You'll get maybe, a half hour, to an hour of gameplay, then throw it aside, along with all those games you got tired of when you were 5.Please, Rockstar, Grand Theft Auto 3 was so much better than this, send this game back to h3ll where it came from...NOW!Best Feature: Violence by the boatload!Worst Feature: Everything else...Final Score: 2/5 Nothing great here, try GTA3 instead."
1,This Game Blows...,"Yep, This game blows. Twenty minutes after i began playing SOE, I had to stop to avoid dying of boredom. Its the same pointless missions over and over again. Theres no redeeming value to this game whatsoever. No wonder I was able to buy this game used only a few weeks after it came out. I'm headed to trade this one in right now."
2,"Good, but repetitive.","First of all, I was excited about this game but overly excited, just because Rockstar (makers of GTA3, which is my favorite game) makes a game doesn't mean it will be great. The game is fun, but is like a standard beat-em-up with lots of weapons and dumb civilians running around. The game is fun, but only for 5-10 periods..."
3,repeative but ok,"Title basically said it all. This game was ok at first but it got old quick. Every level acts and looks the same. I found it more fun just running around shooting people, not going with any story line but that got old quick. This game is worth renting, playing two or three times but that's about it."
3,Ok but not a landmark game,"Graphicliy violent yes, occasionally funny yup, but by no means a landmark game for the PS2. Outside of its open ended play this is just your average shoot em' up. Fun for a few hours but ultimately limited in appeal. Rent it for a couple of days before droping your moolah."
5,Not GTA3,"First off, This game isn't Grand Theft Auto 3. Get over it. It's not supposed to be GTA3. All it's doing is building on it's environment and freedom. I got the game today and love it. It's just as good as GTA3. In this game you do have to like gratuitous violence and blood because there is plenty of it. Overall a splending effort by Rockstar."
1,Why some games should be free,"If you like GTA and Midnight Club, do not assume that this Rockstar game is worth the plastic it is pressed on. The people here who seem to enjoy this monotonous game would probably be entertained by beating a dead animal with sock filled with ping-pong balls. (If that sounds appealing...by all means.) This game is horrible, but now it is old, cheaper, yet still horrible. I was one the unfortunate ones who could not get enough of GTA and thought this was the next step up. If you did not get the memo, saying this game is bad is now a truism. I played this game more than once, but that was only because I was really trying to like this game. So if you're interested, you don't need to buy this game, just find someone who owns it and they will be more than happy to burden you with it."
1,BRUTAL,"What a mess! This game stinky inky inks inks and that is my honest and most friendly opinion of this game. It doesn't even dip into the grand theft auto pool. This is a uneven, unfinished, and unfun game. I WARN YOU ONCE TO STAY AWAY"
1,It's a great game it really is!,I mean this game is fantastic it truly is a great game you have to try it out. State of Emergency for Playstation 2 makes one hell of a Coaster! Never again will your drinks leave marks on the furnature with this remarkable gem from Rockstar. I reccomend that anyone who is looking for a something to rest their drinks on try this game.
2,Not nearly as good as the hype,From all the previews I read in magazines I thought this game would be fun. It gets really old really quick. I'll sum it up in two sentences: Every mission you'll find yourself surrounded by a group of enemies. Your only job is to mash buttons as quick as you can to kill them. Very little strategy and very little fun. If you were impressed by GTA 3 prepare to be disappointed by this game.
2,State of Emergency is cool for 2 minutes,This game is cool when you see everyone running around. It's kind of funny. But this gets old real quick. You end up doing the same thing over and over. All the people running around are the same thing over and over. Rockstar is an excellent game producer with GTA under its belt and Vice City. But this is the WORST of all the games they ever made. I'm sure San Andres will be Awesome but SOE SUCKS! Sorry.
5,the review of life,"This game has pushed the limits on what a game should be even further than GTA3. Parents are garunteed to hate it and kids are gonna love it. you can be on screen with more than 100 people at once. the textures are planer than what you might be used to, but it more than makes up for it with the level of interactability the game has. YOu can pick up just about anything, break any window you see, and all the people react to you in their own way (well, there will be repeats, but there is a lot of variety). there's a great array of weapons and just tons of stuff to do. if you liked GTA3, get this game!"
5,Rockstar made GTA3 the greatest game ever so buy this,"It seems rockstar most have solved most of the slow down problems that are sometimes noticeable in Grand Theft Auto 3 when many characters are on the screen. If so, than this game looks awesome. I better finish GTA3 soon so I can pay full attention to this one when it arrives at my doorstep."
2,"Great idea, poor implementation","I bought 2 of these units thinking I could replace my VCR and DVD player. The good news is that yes, it performs both functions just like my old VCR and my old DVD player, but no more! Oh, it does play back from my Flash cards, but I didn't buy it for that.On the negative side, it won't play any of my VCDs or anything recorded on DVD-R, it also won't play anything on RW media either.While it does do what it claims: plays both VCR tapes and DVDs, don't expect it to play your home made DVDs of your computer. It seems to only playback commercial DVDs. I didn't bother checking to see if it could playback MP3s since I didn't buy it for that.I have a Sony DVD player that seems to playback everything I put in it. I am very disappointed with this Samsung player. Great idea! Poor implementation!"
1,Samsung is a lemon brand! Do not buy from them!,"First of all I tried to tuned in the TV channels, and only 3/5 of the commercial channels worked. Secondly I try and put a DVD in and the remote control is not very receptive. You repeatedly push the button and nothing happens when you try and use it. Thirdly it is slow and sluggish. Fourthly, now it won't accept NTSC and only PAL DVD's! Even though they were fine in the past. I put a NTSC DVD in, and the screen quality looked very poor and went green and now the VHS video side will work!This is a lemon this brand! I'll never buy off these cons ever again!"
5,A Must Have,"After reading and answering the necessary questions, I feel that this book is something that is needed to empower people like myself. Having a desire to to reach goals but not having the knowledge in how to get there was my problem. Now those problems are no longer. Thank you Ms. Junior for sharing your experiences and knowledge in a language that all can understand which has empowered me and I know it will empower others."
3,"Not what I expected, but pleased with purchase","The Insulator version of this tight is not as compressive as the CW-X Expert Pro. They aren't as warm as other winter tights I own. They were useless on a Cleveland winter run. Next time out, I wore them under winter running pants, and I was a happy runner.They run true to size."
5,The Dark Knoght Trilogy,The Dark Knight Trilogy was a perfect present for my grandson who is a very avid Batman fan. He likes all the Batman movies and can't wait until a new feature comes available.
5,Excellent series and excellent quality,"This is a great boxset and a must have for any fan of the new Batman movies. I'm not a big fan of extras, but the ones in this set were of high quality and interesting."
5,GREAT,I LOVE BATMAN MOVIES AND THE FACT THAT IT GOT ON TIME IT WAS NICLEY PACKED AND EVERYTHING AS DESCRIBED RELLY GOT ME SATISFIED
5,Must Have,This is a must have collection for any fan of Nolan's Batman trilogy. It's a sharp looking box set with a high quality miniature concept book included.
1,dysfunctional disc,This was a Christmas gift for my Godfather. The disc1 did not play. We sent it back for a 2nd set...the same problem..disc 1 did not play...finally Amazon gave refund for purchase.
3,Good movie trilogy,"This set is ok, but it was originally selling for over $55, and I waited until I got it for $35 and I am glad I did. The movies are ok, but with all the different actors playing batman, it's hard to follow."
3,Nothing Outstanding,"I would've given this 2 1/2 stars if I could. First off, the Batman Begins disc did not have any bonus features on it even though it was advertised as having them. Second, all of these movies are ""letterbox"" versions with the bars at the top and bottom of the screen. On TDK, the aspect ratio bounces back from the IMAX ratio to the letterbox ratio which gets annoying. Last, there are no menu options on any of the movie discs. This means if you want to stop the disc temporarily, your player will not be able to resume where you left off. I thought maybe it was my player but it did the same thing on a friends Blu-ray player too. Fast forwarding gets really annoying. I pre-ordered this item from amazon for under $30 when it was released. That was a really good deal if you want basic versions of the trilogy. I wouldn't pay the new price of $40. I'd stick with buying them individually for now until Warner Bros. releases a Deluxe version next year."
5,good,i will enjoy this very much cant wait till it gets here i liked all the batman movies good deal
5,The 3 batman dvd's,We loved it all three where great movies!!!!!!!!!!!! We love having them to watch any time!!!!!!!! The quality was great!!
5,Awesome,Love the dark knight trilogy and this was a great way to get it. Pre-ordered and was shipped the day it came out.
5,Met and Exceeded my Expectations,"I was looking forward to getting this DVD set and thought oh, it'll be full of extras, it will be over the top, blah blah blah, yay. Well, for the steller price I got it at I was so excited to learn it's just the bare minimum. 3 movies, an ""extras"" book and that's it. The box set is setup very nice but I'm so happy that the set is just the movies and not all the fireworks and extras. I love a clean cut design and presentation and this set is just that. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good Dark Knight Trilogy for their DVD collection."
5,If you love the newer batman movies than this is your set,Having never watched the newer batman movies and getting this set for a steal was all worth it.This is the first blueray dvd set that I had purchased and WOW what a difference blueray makes!
5,Got it for my dad,"He loved it! It came with a booklet, all the movies in HD. It was a great gift for Christmas and is a great trilogy to watch!"
5,Worth it,What's not to like about the Batman series.Batman and Christopher Nolan .My sequence of liking would beThe Dark KnightThe BatmanThe Dark Knight Rises
5,Worth the Money,The quality was very good. I am satisfied with the movie. Everything that was supposed to be in the package was there.
5,"Best batman ever, great combo at great price","Despite I am a huge batman fan and despite is a great trilogy (way to go Chris N.), this package comes with everything a fan could want to have in blu-ray. I also know there will be more in 2013 regards the trilogy but right now is simply the best. And the special features will keep you stuck atr the screen. the book is also great.Super purchase... hope Superman will get such level considering the name Nolan is all over it."
5,Epic across all three movies!,"If you loved these movies then get them together! not only that but this comes with the ultraviolet copies in which you can play streaming over to other electronice i watched all three on my ipad and it was awesome!!!!!Batman Begins: 5 stars : What a way to recapture the essence of batman/bruce wayne, this movie really does a great job by explaingin the reasoning behind the masked vigilante.The Dark Knight: 5 in a half stars: Heath Ledger Joker those three words are what maeks this movie sooo flippn awesome!The Dark Knight Rises: 6 stars: This was an epic conclusion to an amazing trilogy Bane is a formidable foe and the conflict that bruce wayne has with the way the city has become could not have been anybetter! Catwoman was alot better than i thought anne hathaway was gonna pull off! this move is Epic from Start to fininsh!"
5,Great Buy,i watched the whole batman triology and i was impressed @ the price that i paid. good deal. no complaints
5,AWESOME!!!,"im not sure about all of the other people's reviews, but i didnt have any problems with this. I got everything i asked for 2 days before i was supposed to get it (i missed them yesterday so I actually got it this morning). everything plays fine in my ps3. glad i got this when it was only $30"
5,Huge fan,These have to be the most important DVDs in our collection. I absolutely couldn't wait until it came out. I love it
5,Excellent!,"It has 3 separate DVDs - Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. This will be one of my special collection. It also has a booklet about the making of the movie and the director's cut. A must buy for all Nolan's fans."
1,No DTS Master Audio on Batman Begins and Dark Knight,This is getting returned promptly. What a money grab. A Bluray with without a loss less audio codec is no different than a DVD. What a disappointment.
1,Price?,"I bought one copy at 29.99 and its great. So great I wanted to buy another set as a Christmas gift. The price had gone up to 37.99, not a bad deal, especially being Prime eligible. But when I went to check out, the price had been jacked up to 52.99 and it wasn't expected to be delivered until after Christmas. What gives, Amazon?!"
2,BE CAREFUL!! NO DARK KNIGHT RISES MOVIE IN BOX,I love these movies. I did not get to go tho the theater to see the third movie. I knew that they would make a box set and I could watch it when I got the set. Well to my disappointment I did not get The Dark Knight Rises. Its just missing. I did however get two Dark Knight Rises special features disks. Be careful if you are giving this as a Christmas gift and check to make sure that all the correct disks are there. Any way Warner Bros. can send me The Dark Knight Rises movie please?
5,I'm Batman,"Mmmm ... Love me some Batman...Check out ""How It Should Have Ended"" on YouTube...Here is the link to ""How The Dark Knight Rises Should Have Ended"" ...[...]I'm Batman"
4,i wish there were more special features,"these movies are and always will be great. my only complaint is that the behind-the-scenes features were a bit lacking. there was a good deal of stuff in TDKR, but not a whole lot in TDK."
4,Another Great Movie,There can only be one batman. It has to be Christian Bale he does a masterful job in this picture. I really enjoyed this movie. The camera angles were just great. This was just a wonderful movie.
5,Exactly what you ordered,"Pretty usual with DVD's to get exactly what you ordered, and that's exactly what you get with this. DVD's come original in package and play perfectly, I was surprised that this actually came with a small booklet with pictures from the filming of the entire trilogy which was sort of cool."
5,The Perfect Set,"If you love the Dark Knight Trilogy, this is the perfect set to own.It has all three movies and is presented in a nice textured box for storage and display."
5,Batman,"Awesome, graphics on all three of these are great. Why so serious? Typical batman movies that batman fans will love."
5,Great,"Wonderful, If you like Batman this is the trilogy for you. Gave as Christmas gift. Well received. Will purchase more sets."
4,Love this batman trilogy!,"A great price for all three movies on blu-ray, a must own for any Batman fan, or movie buff. Arrived on time, and packaged well."
4,A great buy!,"Aside from a few scenes in Batman Begins where the audio level seems to be lower than the rest of the movie, I have no complaints. The video quality is outstanding and the IMAX scenes in TDK and TDKR is the most flawless video I've seen on a blu-ray. All in all, a great purchase!"
4,Great Trilogy,"Great Trilogy by Nolan, Sad that this will be the end of such amazing history...the book inside it's just amazing"
4,5 stars but the digital download is a joke,"I love these movies and this package was a great first purchase for my blu ray player.. Only complaint is that I wasted couple hours of my life trying to get the ultraviolet downloads that came with it... from doing some research it seems that this is a problem in general with the digital downloads..""do you know how I got these scars?"""
4,Cheap and good.,"Ok. The box arrived today (9 days before estimated) and i was glad about it. But the thing is the overall box set looks cheap and not too well thought. If you want the movies with a bit of extras this is right for you. But don't expect a superb package remember you're not paying that much. All in all, a great product and the cheapest way to have the Nolan movies in your collection. I got lucky and my discs were not defective or repeated. Now...off to watch the movies!"
4,Dark Knight Trilogy,"Item arrived on time, and was as advertised. Item was purchased for my son at Christmas, but I will give it to him at a later date. I was pleased with this item because it offered my son all three Batman movies at, what I felt, was a discount. Especially when combined with the extra features."
2,Missing discs,There are two discs of The dark night and the Batman Raises one is missing. They should check the product before sending it.
5,AMAZING,LOVE THIS BOX SET!! It has tons of extras and it look GREAT!! I would def recommend this box set to any batman fan...
5,Great Trilogy!,"Happy I found a trilogy of TDK on DVD for such a low price. Bought as a gift for my brother who doesnt have a blu-ray player, haven't opened it yet, but looks good!"
3,I was expecting more extra videos,"Hi dear amazon associates, I love Batman's Movies by C. Nolan. I bought this movie pack expecting to find extra videos with interviews, making of the movie, etc, for each movie. But, unfurtunately, only the third DVD with the movie ""Tha Dark Knight Rises"" had only ONE extra video with an interview to C. Nolan. However, the little book with pictures related to the three movies was great."
2,The Dark Knight,Great trilogy of The Dark Knight. Super price too! Recommend to any Batman fan! A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+
4,Good Deal,This is a great set. The only two minor drawbacks are the non-holographic packaging and parts of the third movie jump between IMAX and widescreen formats.
1,Quick Money Grab,"""Warner Bros. Home Entertainment also plans to release ""The Dark Knight Trilogy Ultimate Collector's Edition"" in 2013.""This is just a quick money grab before they release the real thing, I would definitely wait if you're a Dark Knight fan!"
1,Weak Extras,"I thought it was too good to be true and it was. The trilogy is great except that it is missing one major area...special features. If you want them at all, skip this version and wait for them to be added in on later trilogy versions."
1,save your money,"i already bought the first two dvds with all the extras for $5 bucks each. In less than 5 months TDKR blu ray will be like 14 bucks. Any ""new"" extras can be seen on youtube."
3,The final chapter could have been so much more,"I loved the first two movies but the Dark Knight Rises was a swing and a miss. Not to mention, it appears the quality is a little grainy while watching in my home theater. Most likely due to the constant transition from Imax cameras to normal."
5,Love this box set,We love the Dark Knight series and this box set in blueray was great for us! Each film comes with a disc of special features also. And there's a mini photo book included in the box.
5,Dark Knight Trilogy Review,"I've only watched the 1st and 3rd of the Trilogy movies so far, but both were exceptional. Video and audio excellent."
5,Perfect price for BR + UV,"Exactly what I purchased. All three movies on Blueray plus Ultraviolet, I don't see how this isn't a steal. Not to mention I got it in a day after ordering. Don't listen to the 1,2 star reviews. Their parents didn't hug them enough."
5,Can't beat the price,"On the very same day the DARK KNIGHT RISES was released i bought the trilogy for two dollars cheaper, here, than the single movie was at retail stores! Crazy!"
5,Husband's Christmas Gift,This was a wonderful bargain for a gift for my husband. He is a kid at heart who has never grown up. He loves the set that it came in.
3,Had to return once but got the full set eventually,First copy that arrived at my door had to discs both with the special features to the dark knight but no dark night movie disc. It was my first return to amazon and the process was painless but it did take 4 extra days to receive my full movie set.
5,AMAZING trilogy and deal,"This Blu-Ray set of this amazing trilogy comes in a nice art-decorated box, with the 3 blu-ray discs and additional information in the box set. The movies look breathtaking in the blu-ray format, especially Dark Knight Rises. Get this box set if not for the 3rd installment alone but for the whole series when you want to have a Batman Marathon. You won't be dissapointed!"
2,"I love the movies, but I hate UltraViolet/Flixster digital movies","I expected to be able to put the digital version of these movies on my iPad, but nope. Warner Bros will not allow it. In order to use the UltraViolet digital files you have to get an account with UltraViolet and with Flixter. Then you have to use their applications to watch the movies. If you want to watch the digital movie you have to dowload their app on every device you want to watch the movie on. I am not going to maintain accounts on two different sites to do this and I am not going to install another application to user their digital media... its not happening."
4,"great movies, all them, packaged well, and got here on time","phenomenal films, delivered in great condition and in timely fashion, just wish there were more special features within the dvds, but that has nothing to do with amazon."
3,DVD vs BLU-RAY,"DVD version amazon says, ""special features with all 3 films"" isn't true, ""the story of Bruce Wayne"" & the Theatrical trailer for ""Batman Begins"" is the ONLY special featuresThe BLU-RAY version is the ONLY version with ALL special features"
2,batman trilogy,"all movies but the second (dark Knight) does not work cd does not looked scratched but looks like it was damaged with whater or soemthing bc computer and dvd players in the house do not read disc. Every time its put into dvd player it says ""disc error"""
5,Great price,Great box set. The Price cant be beat for all three great movies! I remember when Blu-rays were still $25 to $30 per disc!
3,Far too corny,"Nothing that great ,too predictable,especially the ending. They gave it away in the beginning of the movie, no need to sit thru the rest."
3,Contains no special feature,Be advised that when you buy this there is only a feature on the disc for The Dark Knight Rises. Batman Begins and The Dark Knight are the same as the Wal-Mart versions that have no special features.
1,Impossible packaging,"Trying to get the two ""Special Feature"" discs out of the bottom section of the plastic case is proving to be impossible. It is very easy to break your discs if you aren't careful. If Warner Bros. took more care in their packaging, this would have gotten 3 stars (3 instead of 5 because of the UltraViolet BS). But unfortunately I have to give this a 1 star rating due to the horrible packaging.If you don't care about the special features and you will probably never want to watch them, then consider this a 3 star set. Otherwise it's a 1 star set due to the fact that it's nearly impossible to get those special feature discs out!"
3,Dark Knight Disc,"Received my package this afternoon, tried watching The Dark Knight in my PlayStation 3 and it tells me that the video can't be played."
3,It works,"I received these disks quickly and they play fine. My only complaint, which is substantial, is that the entire case was covered with packing tape that can never be removed (when I try the illustrations are ripped from the box). I understand it isn't coming in the original wrapper but simply wraping this in some plastic or putting it in another box would have prevented the case from being ruined."
4,Great deal for Batman fans,"In this package, you get basic features of all three Batman movies. Nothing different from having all 3 movies separately.The feature booklet and hard casing are a nice touch but they are not a deluxe feature either.If you are looking for a die hard collector's edition with all metal tin casing, model figures and other stuff, then you should wait.Still, it's a great way to get all movies at one if you don't have them already."
1,Missing The Dark Knight Rises CD,Purchased this item as a Gift and The Dark Knight Rises CD is missing. Only came with 4 of the 5 CD's. I will be returning it for a refund.
1,missing a disc,"My set only included 4 discs. There, where The Dark Knight Rises movie disc was supposed to be sat a big empty disc holder. This is a bit silly considering how big a company warner brothers is >.<"
1,didnt include dark knight rises movie!!!,"really? i have 2 copies of the dark knight rises special features disc and dont have the actual movie. how could a major company allow this kind of terrible production quality?amazon is replacing, but very disappointed after waiting 2 months for this since the pre-order."
1,Useless!,"I bought this for my niece for Xmas. It arrived VERY late, and she has just settled down to watch it, only to find that it does not play in the UK!I paid a lot of money for this, and it's hopeless."
1,MISSING DISCS!,"Husband went to open on christmas morning to find out that it was missing 1 disc, The Dark Knight Rises Feature Movie, wont make the amazon mistake again, should have bought at costco. Will be returning."
5,For the price YES!,"Having the trilogy was exciting for the price of $15.00 was amazing, I was so excited to watch them with my husband I even let him open it early, even though my husband is a huge fan of anything batman and is not a big fan of Christian Bale we still love these movies and will be an excellent addition to our growing collection of all his favorite superheroes we are building for our son!"
5,Love it,"I waited to buy any of these untill the trilogy was completed. And now that they were finished I preordered and bought it. Best trilogy since the Original Star Wars, enough said!"
5,the 2nd best trillagy,I got this plus the blu-ray by itself. the packiging is really cool. its not a cheep box like most.
5,Great Product,Blu ray movies for 30 bucks plus substantial packaging and a nice litle picture book. Honestly I'm in it for the movies. That alone justifies the buy. The difference in blu day and DVD is amazing. I previously owned The Dark Knight and Batman Begins on DVD. The upgrades made sense and are definitely a good move.
5,Action packed,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. It was a great stocking stuffer. So much better than buying them individually.
5,Dark Knight is awesome,It was great watching all three movies in succession. A great review to understand the terrific finish of the series. It's obvious they're leaving it open to sequals!
5,Greatest trilogy ever!,"This is my favorite trilogy, and it came with a digital copy of all three movies! (Each one separately). I have already watched all three consecutively, 5 times."
5,Best Trilogy ever!!,I love all three movies. There was nothing wrong with any of the discs. I would recommend this triology to everyone. Everything was great.
5,i likee,i really like these movies. they are very very very very very very very very very very very very very nice.
5,Solid box set,"For the price, this box set is amazing. Better, its exactly all I need. It doesn't have the extra, limited edition trinkets that come with it, which is perfectly fine for me, it costs less, unlike the Marvel Universe, Phase 1 box set that comes with a cube and brief case... (what a waste, and it doesn't fit nicely into my beautiful movie collection). Starting with the set itself, the box and case are of good quality. The special features are the ones that have been previously seen in the individual releases. This does mean that there are no exclusive features included with this box set. To tell you the truth, for this price, I'm not going to miss not having any new exclusive content."
5,Great price for people who want three Blu-Rays...,"I know people are boohooing because this isn't the ""Super Amazing, Ultimate, Christian-Bale-lives-inside-of-the-boxed-set"" 2013 version of the Trilogy. But for someone like myself who has a moderate movie collection, this is the perfect deal for the perfect price. I am not a big ""new-release movie purchaser"" to begin with (I wait 1-2 years until the movies are dropped to under $10). So for me, having all three on Blu-ray for $30 is just fine. We don't own any of these yet, so I'm happy for this great deal!"
5,Video cd purchased,The person I bought it for loved it! We are all video people and I wassthrilled that you had it on hand.
4,A great trilogy!,"I bought the Dark Knight trilogy as a Christmas gift for my 13-year-old Batman-crazed daughter. She, my husband, and I watched all 3 movies during the Christmas break (my husband and I had already seen the first 2) and we all really enjoyed them. In my opinion, the first 2 movies are better than the third (The Dark Knight Rises has several VERY slow sections), but the trilogy is a great option if you enjoy the Batman movies - and it was definitely a great value. I would recommend this item to a friend."
5,Can't go wrong with this edition!! A must buy for any Batman Fan!,"The cover and the contents of this bare bones set is top notch. I was going to see the third film at the movies until the events that unfolded in the news. For the seventeen dollars and change you get all three movies. The last one, dispite what critics have said, is just as good as the previous films. I ususally like the director's commentary and extras with these sets. There are few extras but the content of these movies more than makes up for it. All three movies are very intense and will last with repeated viewings. I don't have a Blue Ray and really can't afford the cost of upgrading to a new player. However the picture quality is fine and good enough for my current TV set. I'm thinking future editions will have some type of commentary. However there isn't any from the director in this set. The movies are so good that I'm not concerned with that paticular ""extra"" that could have been added."
4,Great deal for the price but not keen on the UltraViolet digital copies.,This three pack was a fantastic deal for the price. I got all three movies plus special features for less than $30. My only complaint is that the digital copies are processed through UltraViolet rather than iTunes or Windows Media Player. This means to play them on my portable devices I have to download an extra app that only works half the time.
5,A Must Have!!!!,"If you are a fan of any of these movies...this is a must buy!!!! I already owned the 1st 2 on BluRay and was only going to buy the 3rd on its own, but for 5$ more I got all three in this case!!!!! Traded in the old 2 and now have a sweet box set!!! The IMAX looks incredible in HD and Bain is Villain of the year!!!!"
5,Amazing buy,"this is what you call an amazing by.this comes with all 3 movies in Blu ray and in ultraviolet which is amazing so I can watch it on my tablet and phone and desktopdesktop.comes with hours and hours and hours and hours of extra content an awesome booklet only thing is the box was a lot smaller than I expected it to be. But I'm not complaining again, this is an amazing buy.perfect for any Batman lover who also thanks Christopher Nolan's performance is adequate."
3,The Dark Knight Trilogy (Batman Begins / The Dark Knight / The Dark...,"The first in the trilogy was the best, the others are so so. I would watch it again and again."
5,Great Blu Ray Value,"All the newer Batman movies at a very reasonable price. I was just going to buy the last movie of this trilogy, but saw this option at a comparable price to the latest Blu Ray Batman movie, and found this to be the better value. Although, IMO, I believe the third and last movie isn't quite as good as the second movie. We almost forgot how good the first movie, was so we watched it again. Just a nice collection to have at a reasonable price which we recommend to others."
5,Amazing deal,"I bought two of these, one for me and one for a friend and i love it. i am excited to have all of these incredible movies and for a great price. Thank you."
5,Awesome,It is great! I absolutely cannot wait to watch this!!!! kjfla;djf dlkfjadsl lksajd lasjd kalsjd akldj jld alksdj alksd lkasd
4,"entertaining, maybe poor video quality to some eyes","Entertaining movies -- especially the second one.My brother watched the third and said the video looked distractingly ""unfinished"" and ""raw"". I personally thought it was fine. And it could have always been my TV or lighting, so take it with a grain of salt unless you see similar reviews."
4,wish it had dvd version included,"Couldn't wait to get this to watch in the privacy of my own home theatre! Just wish it had the dvd versions included so I could put them on my hard drive/media server. I thought Violet would allow me to download the digital version but it only streams it - tried to set up an account but maybe my connection is too slooowww - after three tries at 5' ea, I said screw it - just stick with the discs. The included booklet is pretty cool, but so what- wish the cover design was better (some frank miller art maybe?). Well I'm going to watch it again in a few minutes. I know there are critics out there who point out some gaps in the story line with incredulity. I read comics and I read the news. Gaps in the story line of real life or imagination land are not rare. The movies are bl@p#$n awesome!!!"
5,Awsome product,"Its a Great complete package and for an outstanding price, its three movies for the price of one, with good resolution."
5,Best Movie Set Ever!,I love the Batman Dark Knight Trilogy movies. The package came and the box looks even cooler in person. The case has a smooth almost suede like feel to it. The book that comes with it has tons of artwork and behind the scenes information. I had a blast reading it. If you're a fan you have to buy this! I recommend it to anyone who's a fan and to anyone who knows a fan-this would be a great gift!
5,Batman Rule's,"justo lo que buscaba: Nolan ha sido un director excelente para esta trilogía, lo recomiendo sinceramente a todos los seguidores del caballero obscuro."
5,Batman,What is there really to say. Its a great series. I like Batman and now I have a complete set. It was shipped fast (prime) and arrives in unopened condition.
4,Great deal!,"If you are a fan of the trilogy created by Chris Nolan and don't want to expend too much money, this is a great deal. You get not only the three movies but also some cool additional stuff, like the documentary focused on the batmobile and a very nice -but short- book about the production's design. The combo really met my expectations."
5,Amazing Set,I am a fan of mostly anything involving Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan. I love all three of the movies and I feel they are the best Batman films that have yet to be made. I cannot wait for Nolan's next masterpiece.
4,Almost Perfect,"This set would be absolutely perfect if not for the fact that the movies don't come in three individual cases. Personally, I find this to be a drawback because you have to bring the entire box set along if you want to take just one of the three movies to someone else's house. And there's always the security factor. Discs are much safer when they have their own individual packaging. Overall, great set and a fantastic deal at $30, though. Definitely worth taking advantage of this deal. If the price drives back up to around $50, I wouldn't buy it."
5,I Can't Wait Until December 4th!!!!,"I love batman. I've seen every Batman Movie at least 5 times (except The Dark Knight Rises), l played the crap out of Arkham City and Arkham Asylum, have Batman posters, have Batman pajamas, etc. And now I have this to add to my obsession of Batman.I can't wait to watch the trilogy in Blu-Ray as much as I want, and I also can't wait to have All-Night Marathons of this.In my opinion, Batman is the best superhero. The stories are great, the villians are phenomenal, the costumes are fantastic,and it seems like every Batman movie and T.V show is memorable (except Batman & Robin). Ever since I saw the 3rd movie, I instantly wanted the DVD."
4,Movie night,"this item was preordered, It will be nice to have on the night that it is released for movie night....thanks"
4,Great Price for Blu-Ray,"Product was exactly how it was described, arrived very quickly and in good condition. Would definitely recommend this product to someone. Ordered it as a present for someone and was well received. Great Price."
5,Love it!,Very good deal. Love all the movies! The extra features are awesome. Very happy with this movie set. Batman rules!
5,great price,it was a great price for all 3 batman flims have not had time to check out all the extras but seems fine
5,$35 bucks!? Heck yes,"Great buy. Comes in a really well designed box and all the movies looked fantastic. Cheap price for all three, too!"
5,Three Eternal Masterpieces,"I bought this collection, even though I already had the first two movies in hi-def, because it was only a couple of bucks more expensive than the Blu-ray of The Dark Knight Rises and actually had extra features for that movie.I felt at the end of this movie [The Dark Knight Rises] like I did when I first heard Beethoven's Opus 131. I was so overwhelmed at the mastery of the medium that I had just witnessed that I had a hard lump in my throat, tears on the edges of my eyes and several suddenly-caught breaths. When in the realm afforded us by such greatness, we are like angels discovering we have wings. ""Hey, I never knew I could fly like that! Thank you sir!"""
5,happy with dark knight trilogy!,I bought these for my son for Christmas. He was so happy. They came on time and were perfect. Recommend buying them!
5,What can I say?,"If you liked the Dark Knight series then you will like this. I had the first movie on standard DVD format, and when this first came out and it was around $26 for all three plus 2 extra bonus discs it was a no brainer. The quality is great and it's in Blu Ray. Not sure about the other ""bundle's"" for this, but I was impressed with this one and would recommend it."
5,never gets old,My son and I are big fans of this series and he hinted that he wanted to purchase this. I surprised him and bought it. We continue watching it over and over!
5,How Can You Not Buy This?,"I bought this because I also bought The Dark Knight Rises: Limited Edition Bat Cowl also.These I will watch often and my The Dark Knight Rises: Limited Edition Bat Cowl will be left as it is and saved.What else can I say, I 've liked Batman for around 50 years now.Nuff' Said...."
1,"Watch out, have two same disk of special features, not the movie of The Dark Knight Rises (spanish too)","Watch out, don't have the movie The Dark Knight Rises, instead include two same disk of special features of the this movie. It`s unbelievable. Because I live in Colombia can't back the product.Cuidado, esta versión de cinco discos no tiene la tercera parte de la saga, en lugar trae dos discos repetidos de las características especiales, como vivo en Colombia no me es rentable devolver el producto."
1,Batman Doesn't Begin,"So I recieved the batman trilogy on blu-ray and I went to play the batman begins disc and it would not play. I tried it in a blu-ray player and my ps3 with firmware updates and got nothing. Not only does it not play but it shuts off and freezes the entire blu ray player, and on the ps3 you get to the home screen and there is no play button. Soooo disappointing !!!! even though I'm in the minority with this opinion I like batman begins as much as dark knight rises. So I say to what ever company is pumping these out without quality control, PLEASE STOP!!! it is not just me this has happened to 2 other people I know."
1,"Merry Chr... Wait, wha?","Had not seen Dark Knight Rises yet... Received the Trilogy as a Christmas gift. Two Dark Knight Rises Special Features discs, no movie disc. Now they are saying it will take 2-4 weeks to get a replacement. Needless to say, not too happy about this. Somebody at Warner Brothers needs to put a foot in someone's backside."
1,Where is my Dark Knight Rises?,What i got isDisc 1: Batman Begins Feature FilmDisc 2: The Dark Knight Feature FilmDisc 3: The Dark Knight Special FeaturesDisc 4: The Dark Knight Feature FilmDisc 5: The Dark Knight Rises Special Featuresim so disappointing
1,Ultraviolet is horrible,This review isn't about the actual movie (which I give this combo 5 stars)its about the worthless ultraviolet digital copy that are so difficult to redeem.my opinion would be to stay away from ULTRAVIOLET completely there's so many steps and new accounts to open just to redeem the digital copy.i had to open 3 accounts on three different sites to redeem one digital copy of a movie.ultraviolet needs to be removed from the digital world.go back to the easy digital download from the company named after a fruit which some movie makers still use because they care about the customer.
1,Where's the iTunes code?,No iTunes code = fail.Bleh =(What's up with that Warner Brothers? It doesn't make sense.Gimme a shout when it does include it. Otherwise Pass
5,Amazing quality for the price,"I was wary of getting this because it seemed too cheap for 3 blu-ray movies, but it's perfect! Even the box is good quality, and the video and extras are sharp. Perfect product."
5,What a movie!,"Big movie, all the action and theme, is a wonderful conjuction of elements! The history of this movie will live forever in our minds."
5,Great set,Great set and awesome movies. I had not seen the new Batman movie so I bought the set instead of just the new movie and it is a really nice set.
3,"Great trilogy, but UltraViolet is horrible","If I had paid for just the blu-ray discs of the movies, this review would be five stars. But when one of the selling points is a digital copy, I want my digital copy to actually be useful to me. UltraViolet is not. It's a pain to create an account, and a much bigger pain to actually watch the content that you've paid for. Just trying to use the UltraViolet digital copy is one of the worst customer experiences I've ever had with a product."
5,BATMAN=AWESOME,"THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY IS A MUST HAVE FOR BATMAN FANS. THIS SET IS AWESOME AND IN BLU-RAY, IT SHOWCASES THE MOVIES AS THEY SHOULD BE"
5,Great price for great movies,It is very much worth purchasing all three movies in this set! The price is great and the quality of the movies is great as well!
5,Great Collection,"Im satisfied with this product. It doenst take up much space on my shelf for this trilogy. Nice book and casing design. However the first time i got it, i got 2 copies of the Dark Knight Rises and no Special Features. Got it replaced and now its all good."
5,Great gift,"For my son--he loved it. He had two of the three, but the trilogy came with 'extra stuff' making it superiorl"
1,This is a very special book!,I love this book! It is so interesting to learn about the history of the story and the man who wrote it.
3,Enjoyable puzzler,"Not a lot of ""edge"" to the main character, but there are some nicely subversive plot elements, a well-done romantic subplot, and an interesting early 1960's setting. Not a bad little mystery thriller."
4,Nicely made,We have several trailers and the all have these wheel covers. They have really helped keep the tires from getting sun dried out. I am sure they have extended there life by many years.
5,works as intended,"this little addition has been great for my hand fatique problem. i used to have fingers go numb on extended rides, but now when i get that cramped numbness feel coming on, and can just relax my throttle grip and rest my palm on the rocker and relax my grip while maintaining my speed. what a wonderful relief."
5,great help,this has been a great help to my husband who lost his right hand when he was 12 yrs. old in a farming accident.
2,Wands,"The wands are not the most durable. I purchased them for a play. We rehearsed with them one day and immediately one of them broke. They are not made out of material that is easily glued together.However, they lasted long enough for our play, and that's all I needed."
5,Great,"My neice loved it then when she found out it had lights that really made her smile, she looked so happy in her princess gown, with her Tiara and the wand."
2,Lacking features,"Using Braun alarm clocks for many, many years I am very disappointed with this model which is not worth the astonishingly high price. The clock is silver grey, the hands black. The dial illumination is totally insufficient; the black hands do not reflect the light but are casting very irritating dark shadows. It is impossible to read the time and by trying to figure out what is shadow and what are the hands, the light is off again. In addition, the press-down switch for the illumination makes a loud disturbing cracking noise when pressing it down. The only plus is, that the clockwork really is totally silent, no wonder, it has no second hand. The combination of a wonderfully silent clockwork lacking a second hand and lacking proper illumination makes it difficult to find out if the clock is working at all (if you need to know in the middle of the night)."
5,Very calming.,Very effective. I thought it had an even more calming effect then Kava but a friend who tried it was of the opinion that it was about the same as Kava. I suppose that different people have a different reaction.I was very happy with the results.
1,Made from a weed,I wouldn't buy this again. It didn't help my headache. This stuff is made from a weed. Look up a picture of wild lettuce on google. It grows everywhere where i live in california. If you like it you can make it yourself. But I hated it. The only thing I felt was the alcohol they put in it (and stupid for wasting my money). Nothing like the discription I read online. People say it is opiate-like painkiller. Not true. Don't try this if you are in pain. You will be extreally diappointed. I was.
3,A Good Refresher,"Vocabulearn Danish is an excellent way to refresh or improve one's vocabulary. As it is very hard to learn the Danish language, even when studying in Denmark, this item can help to improve your vocabulary while also listening to the words spoken by a Danish speaker. This is especially important because pronunciation is the most difficult aspect of the Danish language for an English speaker. However, I do not recommend this product for beginners at all. Without knowledge of the Danish grammar the words cannot be conjugated to fit into sentences."
5,One crazy funny book,"I'm an 8 year old Canadian living in Beijing, China, and I love to read. I really like to read funny books. One of my favourites of all time is Calvin & Hobbes, ""Weirdos from Another Planet"". I find this book really funny because Calvin's imagination in this one is the wildest ever! The illustrations are a perfect match for the hilarious stories. I enjoyed the main part of this book, the space adventures of Calvin & Hobbes the best. I found them so funny that I couldn't put the book down in bed, and stayed awake very late. This book made me a real fan of Calvin and Hobbes, and now I can't wait to get more! Elise Hoffmann 8 years old, Beijing, China"
4,Mostly good...,"It's what I wanted and I got it for an unbeatable price...it was a bit more ""used"" than I feel was explained, but other than that it's great."
5,How can you not love Calvin and Hobbes?,The title says it all. A great collection of favorite cartoons about my favorite character.It looks like five more words are required for my review. There. I'm done!
5,Great way to get my 9 year old to read!,"Like most kids, mine never wanted to read - then my youngest came across Calvin and Hobbes and now he gets a different book each week!"
5,It's going to be a Warm Winter,"Bought this sharpener and replacement blade for my husband as we burn with wood in the Michigan winters........ He loves it and so do I used it four times so far, easy to set-up and use. Had one at work and now we have one at home............ Don't need to go in and sharpen blades early or on the weekends, just go home and when it get dull- sharpen away."
1,poor quality,"the first time I tried to use the chain saw sharpener, the disc fractured into multiple pieces. The plastic guard gets in the wayHave never been able to use it!!!!"
1,I did not receive my article,I still did not receive the goods. And I sent an email last week which remained unanswered.
1,"A largely useless, narrow view of a complex man.","In Stalin: Breaker of Nations, Robert Conquest has done what should never be done in historical works. He starts out with a point to prove, then chooses stories which support that point. This is a ridiculously skewed view of a terribly complex human being. Conquest compounds the problem by not footnoting the work at all, so that 90% of his material cannot even be found by anyone wishing to follow his research. He also, in the bibliographical notes, relates how other authors on Stalin have been ""taken in"" by various accounts, which are more neutral in their portrayal of Stalin... yet fails to expound on what other, more negative, sources have taken him in. For a simple work of character assasination (of a figure for whom this has been done MANY times), this work is acceptable. As a historical work, it is essentially useless"
1,Cold War Lies,"This is one of the most historically inaccurate books published on the Cold War, and in specific Stalin. Robert Conquest is the head of the ""cold warriors"" who simply re-wrote history to fit their propaganda purposes. Conquest actually worked for a division of British Intelligence in the 50's and 60's which created anti-communist propaganda, based on sheer fabrication and lies. This work is no different. It stinks of right wing anti-communist propaganda and fabrication. The original anti-Stalin propaganda first came into the US in the 30's via Hearst, who relied on sources from his good friend Adolf Hitler. For a more objective and less politically motivated look at Stalin I would reccomend ""The Soviet Communist Party Reconsidered"" by J. Arch Getty, ""Life & Terror In Stalin's Russia"" Thurston, ""Stalin: Man Of History"" by Ian Grey, among many others. Please do not take this book seriously!"
1,Conquest: Breaker of Dictionaries,"All I have to say is if you want to feel incredibly stupid, just read a chapter in this book to find out all the words Robert Conquest knows that you don't. I had to have a dictionary accompany me when I decided to pick up this book. The information is excellent, but Conquest needs to stop showing off his superior linguistic skills and concentrate on organizing his information. Another thing that displeased me was the constant sidetracking. Conquest got off topic so much that I would forget what periods of Stalins life he was discussing. Furthermore, half the book is about the intricacies of the pre and post revolutionary Russian government and backrounds of all the party members. The sidetracking was very distracting from the topic at hand. This is the only on of Conquest's books that I have read, but if the rest of them are like this then I feel comfortable in saying that Conquest may be a lot smarter than I, but I guarantee you I'm a better writer."
4,very good book,"This book is easy to read - it flows - well written - with a lot of information. If you want to know about Stalin as a youngster, his rise to power, and his evil rule over Russia this is the right book. It goes into detail about his motives and his evolution into a ruthless murderer. I recommend this book to any fan of history."
4,Elsa user,"Well, this card is pretty good. In my opinion it is one of the bets in its price range, a good buy."
5,Excellent Tool for the price,"I decided to buy the Omron Pocket Pedometer, because of the high points it received here. I had been using a MP2 by MYTrack, but often had trouble with it. It was also more expensive to use, due to the yearly sign up for their website.Omron is light weighted, can be worn on your clothing, or put into your pocket. I still use the little safety line, just to be sure I do not loose it.I think for the price, this is one of the best health tools on the market."
3,"Worked as Expected, but Belt Clip Bad","I bought this specific pedometer for a program my employeer. It work exactly as expected, and I had no issues with it. I did end up loosing it because the belt clip didn't work well. The program with my employeer received complaints about this, and recommended keeping it in your pocket. It wouldn't count all your steps in your pocket though."
4,omron pedometer,Work ok 95% of the time. Some days it doesn't register my aerobic steps. The clip on holder doen't always stay on when rise from a sitting position.
3,walk on by,I like the miles calculator and the software to summarize a month or more data.Be sure to use the safety strap. The belt clip does not stay on well.Would buy again.Jim
1,"Nice Pedometer, Terrible Warranty Service","I had one of these fail on me after 4 months of use, so I called and got an RMA number and shipped it back to Omron at my expense. After 3 weeks I still had not received a replacement so I called. Omron told me they were out of stock, despite the fact that Amazon and plenty of other retailers seemed to have plenty. I finally got my replacement about a week after that. It came with a bill for $8.00. Apparently the warranty doesn't cover return shipping, even when you have a defective product that fails during the warranty period. So they don't keep replacements in stock, don't notify customers of delays and don't cover the full cost of replacing a defective product.This is not a company with a customer friendly culture."
3,Casual Pedometer,"I've been using this pedometer for about a month now. It's OK, but a little big to carry around in your pocket all the time (I don't use the belt clip). The software that comes with it is intuitive and easy to use. I've noticed though that the pedometer itself is not all that accurate in counting steps. Over some short distances, I've manually counted my steps and then compared and have noticed differences in step count of up to 20%. So, if you are looking for complete accuracy, this probably is not the right device. Overall, it's a good buy and gives a decent idea of distance walked. Just don't rely on it too much."
4,MY COUSINS DREAM COME TRUE,My cousins daughter is 2 yrs old. She loves Sunny Patch Friends.I could not find a toy anywhere until i found this product and outof all the things for Christmas this was her favorite! Thank you!
2,Looks Great. Too Bad I Can't Hear Much Of The Dialogue,"I'm sure that this is an interesting movie, except that the dialogue in the soundtrack has been recorded many levels lower than the general background sound level in the movie. I hate movies like this where the soundtrack has not been normalized. With both the Windows volume at max, Amazon Unbox volume at max and my headphone's volume at max, the dialogue was barely discernible, although the general background sound of the movie was then too loud. I don't understand why motion picture sound engineers do this. At least Amazon could have normalized the soundtrack levels before offering this movie for download."
3,LIKE A LUCID BUT WEIRD DREAM,"This stylish Swedish animated film is about a terrifying, paranoid, dystopian conspiracy set in Europe in 2024. The world is running out of oil and the Trexx Corporation has connected all the undergrounds, or subways, together into a gigantic network. Roger (voiced by Vincent Gallo), a Stockholm call center worker, avoids the underground and blatantly, defiantly rides his bike to work. Sometimes Roger hears voices in his head. Roger soon discovers that Trexx and a vast consumerist conspiracy control his life down to the smallest detail. With the help of beautiful super model Nina (voiced by Juliet Lewis), Roger attempts to break free. An unusual animation technique manipulates real photographs. This film, directed and co-written by Tarik Saleh reminds me of the best works of Terry Gilliam, Roy Anderson and others. It's like a weird but lucid dream."
1,Poor Quality,The sound was terrible. I couldn't hear the audio and therefore was not able to watch it. Please fix it.
2,Not useful,"Perhaps the author is a better speaker than she is a writer and perhaps her workshops are more inspiring and insightful than her books? Unfortunately this book was neither informative nor inspiring. It consists of rambling remeniscenses about the author's life, which seem unrelated to what the author supposedly set out to do (to make the details of your life meaningful and manageable). She rehashes cliches and clobbers us over the head with heavy-handed metaphors. Ugh. The only thing that could have saved this book was better editing , which would have left you with 1 page of material that was worth reading (the exercise of walking through your home and assessing what you love and what you don't). There are far better books than this, using far better exercises to help you discover what you love, what your values are etc. Don't waste your money or your time on this one!"
4,aquarium was received promptly,This is probably the smallest size aquarium that could be used for a hamster. I am glad we didn't get the size smaller.
5,Sirens Sang of Murder,"A comment on Mr Schau's review of August 16,2000--What attracts me, and I think others to Ms Caudwells books, is her clever intertwining a riveting mystery with the equally baffling intricacies of the confiscatory tax structure of the U.K. Who among us does not use our knowledge to mimimize our taxes? To read a thrilling mystery and gain an educated insight into the workings of the Revenuers is a delight indeed. Since I was introduced to ""Sirens"" while on holiday in London (at one of those stuffy 19th century Pall Mall clubs), the hunger for her books has continued. More, Ms.Caudwell! --with the intrigue AND the tax info!"
2,The Sirens Song of Murder(Hilary Tamar),It was a little hard to read normally I can't put a book down but this one I found it hard to pick and start reading again.
2,"8,000 btus","i found this on line somewhere else and it has 8000 BTUs. i think i will get it, i'll let you know if it's any good. wish me luck!"
3,Fits the use.,This drill fits the use I had for it. I am drilling wood so it is a little over-kill but wasn't able to find anything else in this size.
2,Disappointing,"The initial premise for the book is great - a man cannot find the perfect woman, so he creates an artifical woman to meet his standards of perfection, and he falls in love with her. This could have been a brilliant novel about a man's unrealistic expectations of women, about gender roles, about what (if anything) really separates humans from machines, about creators and the created... but instead, it ends up being a rather tedious and pointless story."
3,I've used two of these and only one worked,"I used one of these cables purchased by someone else and it worked fine. So I ordered one for myself and it did not work - the signal was distorted. When I tried a different HDMI cable, the signal was clear, indicating the problem was with the cable. I'm returning it. I gave it 3 stars because I have a 50% success rate with using this product. I decided to go with the Mediabridge cable, which costs more than 3 times as much. Still, if I were to roll the dice again, I would buy it - the cost is so low it's worth taking a chance on a defective one. The return process is extremely painless if it doesn't work out."
2,Cable Spotty -- Bad Quality,I received the cable in place of my old HDMI cable. The cable often did not work as I connected my laptop to my TV. I had to play around with it a lot to get it to work. I tried it with other devices and it still was inconsistent. It is really cheap but it hasn't given me much value. I am very disappointed. Maybe it was just a lemon cable and if so I would love to get a replacement.
4,finally got a working one,"after 3 tries, the third cable actually works. First two were defective and everytime I emailed them they were prompt in sending me a new one. Good price so I really can't complain."
2,Product Quality Verification Lacking,"There was a bad connection in the one I received causing the sound to be slightly garbled at times as well as an occasional dropout of the video signal. I'm sure this isn't normal or their overall rating would be much lower, but returning defective items is enough of a pain that will try a second brand next time."
4,5 bucks for 25ft = PROFIT!,"You can't really ask for anything better. This has been an awesome purchase, well worth the money. BUt I suppose if you move it around frequently then this won't last long. But if you just plug it in and just leave it there forever then you really can't get a better deal then this. Quality is exactly the same as more expensive cables, don't believe companies who claim otherwise, there have been tests done, Google for them.WOuld've been a lot better if they were braided though, but for 5 bucks that asking for too much."
5,Exactly as expected,"The cable arrived quickly.It seems to be well made and durable. I have connected both of my Dell computers (Studio 17 and Mini 10) to my 32"" Vizio 1080p TV. It has worked well.I would buy it again if I need another."
1,Worked for a minute,I hook this up with much anticipation but that lasted for about a minute. The only thing that showed on the TV was my wallpaper and that flashed on and off every few seconds. No icons were displayed or anything else for that matter. Going to try a more expense item. You get what you pay for.
4,Good Price,"These all do the same job, and I needed one that was really long, good price I would have paid a lot more if I had gone elsewhere."
2,HDMI Review,I only used this cable a few times. I hooked up my computer to my tv and it just stopped working unsure what it was so I tried another HDMI cable I had and it worked. So this cable was a waste of $$. (get what you paid for)!!
4,Great for the price,Got this to connect my laptop to a projector. Haven't received the projector as yet but tested the cable with my new LCD HDTV and it works just fine. No problems so far. Only concern is that the connection to my laptop seems a bit shaky but hasn't posed a problem thus far. I'll update this when I get my projector.
4,very satisfied with this product,Read some comments that this product broke easily at the connections. But it hasn't been m y experience--I connect and reconnect the cable quite often and thus far it has performed OK.
4,Super Clear Super Good,Great quality highly recommend buying this product over the amazon brand. I just purchased one of the cheap 5 dollar cables and it was super fuzzy on my ps3. When I plugged this one in crystal clear.
1,Defective,"I got this cable for like $6 so no big deal, but it DID NOT work. Ended up throwing it away"
1,Beware of HDMI Cables,These particular cables just do not work. The supplier was responsive and replaced them but the second batch had the identical problems. Again the supplier responded promptly with a refund but just beware of some manufacturer HDMI cables.
1,faulty cord,"cable does not work, tried another brand and it seems to work fine. item is to cheep to return, i guess i get what i pay for"
1,Piece of crap,The hdmi cable worked great for about 3 days and then stopped working would not recommend the product or company.
1,"Colors are bad, dark gets speckled, and it cuts out constantly. Do not buy.","All of my dark colors get speckled with white dots, grey colors look green, and worst of all, the thing can't keep the signal. It cuts out all the time. I know the monitor is perfect and the video card it's coming from works wonderfully. It isn't them. This cable is crap. Spend a little extra coin and go for something (i'd say) 20 dollar range. It'll be worth the quality, I promise."
5,CABLE SCHMABLE,"I purchased (2) of these cables to use with my OPTOMA HD20 which was purchased at the same time. To me a cable is a cable, it delivers the signal or doesn't. I can comment I'm very pleased with them; the price was very reasonable (especially considering the length of 25') and the cables are easy to use. They are very flexible (as opposed to some I've used) which made them very easy to rout in my self installed home theater system. Very highly recommended."
2,"Works for HDMI, not for HDCP content","I had never heard of HDCP before I used this cable with my brand new Apple TV I got for Christmas- and I am a computer geek. After hooking up with this new cable and trying to play Netflix content, it refused to play citing that the equipment didn't support HDCP. Just to make sure it wasn't something with the specific content I was selecting, I moved the Apple TV and used the old cable, and it worked fine. I have no idea how to be sure if a cable supports HDCP or not (which just sounds ridiculous to me) but now I need to figure that out before spending more money on a replacement cable, and seeing what I can do with this cable after I've already run it through my wall."
1,Does not work with Mac,Waste of time and money. Quality ok price excellent for the footage. Previous reviews read that is why I purchased can't believe everything you read even this!
1,Does not work!,"Cable does not work. I currently use a 10 foot HDMI cable but need something longer and this is not the product. No picture or sound, poor product. I would not recommend buying."
1,Doesn't Work,"Appears to be well constructed and durable, however mine doesn't work at all. Perhaps i got the lemon of the bunch."
2,Couldn't push full bandwidth,"I am running this cable from my home theater system to my projector on the other end of the room. This cable works flawlessly at 1080p 24hz, but when upped to 50hz or 60hz, it really struggles to keep full bandwidth. It certainly supports the frequency, but about two or three times per minute I would lose signal for a second then it would come back. Secondly there was noise in the line (only while at > 24hz) causing horizontal lines to intermittently show up for a brief second.I'm now going to have to order some better cables as 24hz isn't sufficient for my home theater system, fast movement results in a blur and a frame is dropped about every two seconds."
1,"Looks great, not worth the $$","This cable sounded too good to be true, but I've been fooled before by a low price and was blown away by the quality. NOT on this one. It is in fact a 25ft cable, true enough. HOWEVER, the ""gold plated"" HDMI connections are NOT gold plated, and it also does NOT transmit true 1080 resolution. 720P was the best I could get out of it, which is ""HDMI"", but a true HDMI version 2 cable should transmit 1080i or 1080p with no problems. Maybe it's defective, but I don't think so since it does WORK, just not in true HD fashion. Spend more on a higher quality cable IMO."
1,staticky,There's always a ton of static on the screen when I used this cable. I had to replace it within a week. Total garbage.
1,This item did not work as required.,"With this HDMI cable, there was snow in the picture. Also, the picture cut in and out frequently. I have never had this problem with my current set up in the past. The only new item was this HDMI cable. Obviously, I do not recommend it since it was completely useless.Link Depot HDMI to HDMI Cable (25 feet)"
1,Too cheap to be true.,"This cable is not capable of correctly transmitting 1080p signals. The output contains pixel errors and red lines. It is too cheap to return. Amazon should not carry this item, it is below Amazon's quality standards."
1,Less than Useable,Hooked it up and the picture is there but it's full of artifacts. By artifacts I mean it looks like its snowing different color snowflakes lol. Don't buy this if it's for serious use. I don't know anyone who would use it.
1,Pretty much DOA,"This product does not work, I have tried using it on several setups to make sure there was no hardware failure any place, and this just did not work. When I used my computer and brought the resolution down to 480i, it would display a picture, but would flicker on and off (more off than on)."
1,Dead on arrival,"This cable would not support 1080P, but it would support 480i. Kind of odd. I'm guessing that some, but not all, of the wires inside of the cable were severed. Very disappointing because I ran this cable through a bunch of conduits only to find out that I now have to rip everything apart and start over.Do not buy this cable. 100 out of 500 reviews call this cable DOA."
1,Garbage Cables,"Stay away from these cables. They have zero shielding. Artifacts galore onscreen! Stick with ""Blue Rigger"" cables!I bought 4 cables - they were all defective.GURU"
1,Dead on arrival,"Tried using this to connect my PC to my TV, did not work at all. The best I got was a black screen and static noise. Other HDMI cables do work so I'm sure the cable is the issue. At least it was cheap and amazon offers free returns so props for them."
1,xbox 360,"Significant video quality loss. Flashing pixels, flickering, etc. This cord definitely doesn't have the quality to transmit 1080p video 25ft."
2,"Poor construction, picture is fine, but it WILL break","These cables are OK if you will plug them in once and never touch them again. However, they can barely handle being unplugged. Actually, they really can't. Mine broke in one day. I always go for cheap HDMI cables, but this is going a little too far.I refuse to pay return shipping on these, a product that lasts one day should not cost me a cent out of my pocket."
5,"WOW, WOW, WOW",This is fantastic. The price at a retail store is almost $50. This works great with no problems at all.
3,25' HDMI Cable,I ordered 2. Only one worked. Same problems as everybody else has. Just expect this if ordering.
2,Product not as it appears,"Wow this cord is a monster and not in a good way! At least for me. If you are looking for a heavy duty hdmi cable that you can suspend your honda from buy this one. If you are looking for an hdmi cable to link your dvd player to your tv with a little discretion get something else.The cable diameter is twice as thick as a regular hdmi cable, the connections themselves are about 2 inches long or about twice as long as a normal hdmi cable.The picture is a lie!Disclaimer: Some people might find the beefyness of this cable to be a positive."
1,Piece of junk,I guess you get what you pay for... This cord does NOT work for TVs over 720p. If you have a new HDTV (which is most likely 1080p) then go get a higher class cord...
5,All I expected,The item arrived both on time and just as it was expected. The cable felt very solid and sturdy. The connection was used to connect my pc to my HDTV. It was very easy it fit just fine and the connections were although solid not overly bulky to fit in the required space. The signal transfered is very high quality and quite clear. All in all the product was a great buy since I have seen others for much more that can't do a better job than this cable can. I heartily recommend it.
5,Good quality !,"I use it to connect a laptop to an HDTV and it performs flawlessly. I'm very satisfied with this cable, it's thick but bends easily, made of soft material."
2,Damaged Port of HDMI for one of it,"Hello ,I have ordered 2 HDMI 25' cables and they received on time. They were packed in cover and I opened it when I was connection to my media room and found one of the cable HDMI port is broken and removed completely from the connection. I didnot see it till yesterday and would like to return the product now. Suggest me how to contact the seller and send this item or will I get the new item, let me knowLink Depot HDMI to HDMI Cable (25 feet)"
3,"thin gauge = direct connect, no switch or coupler","This cable works with some caveats. Due to the thin gauge and lack of noise chokes, there is more signal degradation than the better quality cables. Yes digital is more immune to loss but it has its limits. A direct connection is fine, but if the signal goes through a switch, coupler (e.g. wall plate) or any other extension, pixel corruption occurs. This may manifest as sparkles throughout the picture or periodic dropouts. Price was insanely low so I didn't expect much. It doesn't work for my setup unfortunately, but if someone just needs a connection straight from a DVD to the TV, this would be ok."
2,zero durability,"The cord is fine if nothing will touch it. If you want the cheapest cord you can get that will work, get this one. If anyone will ever touch it past the first time you plug it in, look elsewhere. My dog has tripped over 3 of this cord and broken it each time. (Cord is plugged in to laptop on couch, dog jumps up, broken connector) the connectors for this cord are very poorly made. That's probably why they're so cheap. (We have another cord and it has survived much more abuse)"
4,Works just as good as the expensive cables!!,This cable does everything an HDMI cable should and it doesn't cost 40-60 dollars. Definitely recommend this over the pricier cables.
5,Awesome!,Connected my TV with the cable. Works great! Clear view. Good length. Can cover my whole room. Recommended for gamers!
2,Didn't work.,"I had to return these cables. The cables just wouldn't work. I was totally unimpressed with these cables, they were so were very thin and cheap looking."
1,NO GOOD,The cable seem fine but send shotty video at best and no audio at all. Do not purchase!!!! Sending mine back today.
1,HDMI 25 ft cable,Cable did not work. Found out cable did not work after setting up outstie HD TV. Tested the 25 ftcable on another TV. Did not work. The HDMI to the cable worked. Ordered product from another endor and did not have any problems.
3,Picture isn't correct,"I purchased this cord to run between my new LED wall mounted Flatscreen TV and a laptop about 15 feet away. The photo of the coiled cord is incorrect for this item. About 2"" beyond the head of the HDMI connector on both ends of the cable is mounted a large round cylinder (about an inch in diameter and 1.5"" in length) not shown in the photo. This was problematic because it forced my flat screen tv to sit about another inch off the wall. I was trying to achieve a very a streamlined sleek look for mounting my flat screen and this cord kinda ruined the look. Otherwise it works fine, signal and so forth is clean, construction quality is solid. If wall clearances aren't an issue get this cord as its a great deal. I can't believe how much the big box stores ream you for cables these days. I guess it all boils down to inelastic demand."
1,Worked for a little,Worked fine for a few weeks then the connectors seem to be loose?If you wiggle it it would get signal in and out...
1,DISAPPOINTED,"We purchased this HDMI cable based on the reviews. We thought this would be a good product. Well, apparently it is just a cheap cable and it does not support the new Smart HDTV's. We originally had it hooked up to an older HDTV and we could watch there. But when we hooked it up to our new smart HDTV,it said on screen that the HDMI cable does not support this tv and it does not support that high of resolution. Wish I knew I could return and get my money back.This was a complete waste! We went to Best Buy and bought some monster cables that support our new TV--they said a lot of the HDMI cable on amazon do not support the high resolution of new tv's. Wish I had known that first before spending money on this. Lesson Learned."
1,HDMI cable,It did not work-when we connected the cable could not get a signal. I think I got a defective product so obviously can recommend this.
1,No good,It's great that HDMI cables are getting cheaper and cheaper. Unfortunately this one is too cheap. Or cheaply made anyway. I ordered this cable to connect my laptop to my AV receiver. The picture produced was distorted so bad I could sort of tell my desktop was up on the screen but everything was completely unviewable. I tried to connect direct to my TV and the picture cleared up slightly but not much.
