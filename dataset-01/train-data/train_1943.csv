5,PULLEY (L) SET,NICE PULLEY SET BUT FOR A COUPLE OF DOLLARS MORE YOU CAN GET ONE WITH A LOT MORE PARTS AND A MOTOR.
2,"A lot of fluff, not a lot of detail","While this book is filled with 1000 different images, you don't get any details. What does the card look like when opened? What type of client was this project done for? Also, the images are incredibly small so you can't read any of the copy, which for some of the designs, is critical to their success. I wouldn't have bought this book had I been browsing in a store and been able to see it first."
4,Cool book!,"Overall, this book is interesting because it has many great concept designs, but there are some too crafty designs."
2,Very little variation for a '1000 Greetings',I was disappointed with this book as the majority of cards are Christmas related and a lot of them are from the same contributers. There is some nice stuff in there but with 1000 'greetings' I had hoped for A LOT more variation and not all American but International cards.
5,"1,000 Greetings","Whether you are a seasoned design professional or an aspiring beginner, this book will challenge and encourage you forward.Excellent idea starter. So many creative ideas that I have spent more than 25 hours reaping concepts from it's pages.Worth many times more than it's price."
1,This is JUNK,"The product description states this is a genuine OKI product. That is total fiction. This is actually a ""compatible"" product. I decided to try it anyway. That was a huge mistake. It did not seat properly in the printer causing the lid of the printer to get stuck in a half open, half closed position. The company's customer service was apologetic, and offered a refund. However, they said it was Amazon's fault that their product was described incorrectly. When I finally was able to open the printer without breaking the lid, I trashed this piece of garbage. Buy at your own risk!"
4,Deserves to be Reprinted,"This is a very interesting, and in many ways presicient, work of science fiction. The author created a compelling future world based on genetic engineering well before these ideas were common. He incorporated religous and mythic elements into the story in a particularly creative manner. The writing is very good. This book is a fine combination of technological extrapolation and story telling. The best comparisons I can think of for this book, and this is a considerable compliment, are books of Arthur Clarke's such as the City and the Stars. If you are a science fiction fan, and find a copy of this book, buy it and read it."
4,"A book with depth, style and class.","""The Helix and the Sword"" is one of those books that restores faith in SF. McLoughlin's style is elegant and often surprisingly powerful, and the plot is interesting. His characters are sometimes a little weak - the protagonist seems to react rather than act throughout the book - but his depiction of a feudal space-based society based on genetic engineering is the best backdrop since ""Dune."""
3,Huge Huge Huge,"This is a nice quality cover but be aware when you are buying this, it is larger than you will expect. when I placed this on My sunlight camper that measures 12 ft. in total lenght it is about 6 ft too long. sizing charts are not readily available so I will let you know what I found out. On the box there is a diagram showing to measure the base of your camper (that which fits in the bed of your truck including the overhang behind your gate) at 10-12 ft. I wish I had bought the smaller one but will have to make this one work. it doesn't cover the front of the unit (unless you get a size to large as I did, you can wrap the camper up with all the excess material) but does cover the grandma unit. all in all a good product for the price just be aware of the size."
2,This is pretty bad,"This series entered when NFS had already dominated the import tuner genre. Honestly I never played the first one but beside the cars' appearance, everything else is rubbish. The cars have poor/unrealistic handling(especially in drift mode). They all have this generic engine sound which is pretty annoying. The tracks are challenging but after a while they start to all look pretty familiar. Would not buy this game again."
1,I disagree,"I respectfully disagree with Kyle's assessment of this CD. I bought it upon reading his review, and the Romeo and Juliet piece is nothing like other renditions (the nicest one I've ever heard is one I have on record, with Nino Rota himself conducting an orchestra in a live concert.) I think Rota's Romeo and Juliet theme is one of the most beautiful ever written (outside of Bach, etc.) but this ain't the one to listen to. Besides the record mentioned above, a CD entitled ""Great Movie Love Themes"" copyright 2002 Var√©se Sarabande, has a really really nice rendition, maybe by Rota himself."
1,Different,I have not read the book...but perhaps now I will - just to get a better perspective? I was looking for that specific point that would 4 star this movie but never found it. I loved the glass church - but the tragic end of Oscar took that beauty away... It could have been so much more but failed in the love story class and the historic as well. The only saving grace was the scenery...even viewing it on my Kindle Fire it showed up magnificent! Spend your money on Gone With the Wind if you're looking to find a classic.
5,Shelby Lynne where have you been...,"Seeing Shelby Lynne perform to an intimate audience in Amsterdam's Paradiso was the closest I've been to having a religious experience... Overwhelmed by the presence and voice of blonde wisp of a thing, Lynne, I purchased the CD the very next day. I've been playing it for weeks and preaching it to anyone who will listen. Why? because it's thaaat good! From the country pop explosive opener Your Lies, and on to the sultry I'm Leavin' Lynne plows on through genres en textures on what is one of the best recent releases. Lynne muses over life after the relationship in I Thought it Would be Easier with low, sultry, emotive vocals and picks up the pace with bluesy rockers Gotta Get Back and Why Can't You Be. Absoulte highlights on ""I Am Shelby Lynn"" are dreamlike Dreamsome and Black Light Blue where Lynne's voice sweeps you up in her emotions. Shelby Lynne, I don't know where you've been, but I'll be watching very closely where you go!"
5,IT STAYS IN THE PLAYER 24/7,"WEEK ONE OF IT'S RELEASE I HAD TO PICK IT UP. AFTER LISTENING TO BITS OFF THE WEBSITE I HAD TO HOP ON DOWN TO MY LOCAL RECORD STORE IMMEDIATELY. AND SINCE I'VE PICKED IT UP, IT HASN'T LEFT MY PLAYER. WHETHER YOU KNOW SHELBY'S MUSIC OR NOT, YOU LOVE EVERY MINUTE."
1,a waste of money,"i originally received the mighty bright adapter and light as a gift. i attached the adapter to the light (no batteries were in the light as directed) and plugged in the adapter, turned on the light; nothing happened - no light. i disconnected the adapter and put in batteries and the light worked great! then i tried the adapter again, w/o batteries, and it still didn't work. so i thought i got a bad adapter and ordered another adapter. i hooked it up and it worked great - for one night. the next night when i turned on the light the light didn't come on; i put in the batteries and the light worked. it's definitely a waste of money to buy this adapter as it's useless."
1,GREAT BUY!,"This product is wonderful and at a fantastic price, compared to other retail stores. Not having to pay shipping on top of the low price, was especially appealing and I received it in three days."
1,fell apart ):,Very displeased with this product...it fell apart after only 8 games (u-10 kids are not THAT heavy) the underside is peeling away and the seems are all pulling apart....what a dissapointment for our team!
4,Insta-bench six-seater,"Love the bench! But, the bag is not as sturdy as the bench. I've already had a problem with it tearing."
1,"Can you say ""falling apart at the seams""","First the plastic type material underneath the seating material tore almost all the way around. I believe this happened because the top layer material stretches and the underneath material does not. It is used by 12 year old boys during soccer games so weight is less than 1/2 what its rated for.The the carrying bag came apart at most of the seams, this I don't know why. I can put pictures up if anyone wants.It was used in the spring season (10 games) and now in the fall for only 7 games. It actually fell apart around 2 games ago.What is the warrenty? Does anyone know who to contact?"
5,great bench,"I bought two of these for my children's soccer teams. They are easy to carry, deploy, and collapse. One person can manage the bench without difficulty. Also very inexpensive for the convenience of getting the soccer players off of the ground and focusing on the game. Get the black-- save $20. The royal blue one gets too dirty and looks worn quickly."
5,GREAT ITEM,THIS ITEM IS BEING USED BY SOCCER TEAMS AGES 7 THROUGH 13. WE ARE VERY SATISFIED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE ITEM AND THE PRICE PAID.
5,Lovin it!,"Love these benches....loved it sooo much that I ordered a second one for our other childs team. Sturdy, well made and durable!"
4,soccer Bench,Purchased for Granddaughters soccer team. The girls love sitting on it and between games it makes a nice place for them to stretch out and rest on it. Only complaint is that after using for 2 months now (approx. 12 games) the bottom material is pulling away from the top and hanging down.Hopefully it will not affect the durability of the seat itself.
4,Six-seater,Very impressive walking to the (soccer) fields and opening up and having my team sit while the game progresses. The six seater is good but when you have 12 players and 6-8 are on the field the smaller bench whould be more practical. But as the kids grow the six seater will be better. It is good also for the parents to sit on at practice and to use at tournaments. We also used it for sitting on at the local Pungo Strawberry festival parade.It is very well constructed and water resistent. The kids have been lying down on it during the game and it is good for a mini triage for broken parts during the game.
5,Fantastic Bench for all ages!,This new bench has solved all of our problems during games. It keeps the kids in one place and they have a nice place to sit when not playing in the game. We use it for soccer and baseball for all ages. Easy to set up and take down. We love it!
1,very disappointed,Insta-Bench 6-Seater Portable BenchI'm very disappointed in this bench it only held up to 2 games and is already falling apart. The lining is peeling away under all the seats and is hanging. And now on the 3 use the fabric is coming apart. The bench looks like we have had it for years not 3 games.
1,Not Sent the 6 Seater,If you select the red 6 seater from the icon - you are sent the red 3 seater.The description states you are getting the 6 seater. This is not the case.
5,"So far, so good!","We have been using this for our 7 & 8 year old boys soccer team, and so far it is perfect! We have used it for about 10 games, and there have been no problems. It is great for the kids who aren't in the game at any given time. We haven't had any rainy weather yet, but think it will be nice for them to not have to sit on their soccer balls or on the wet ground. Not very heavy, and easy to set up and fold up after use."
2,"Shipping good, product bad","Received the calculator and it worked fine at the start. Then after a week and a half it has some coded in the registries and no longer work correctly. After I received the item and it thought was working fine, I discarded the invoice and not sure if I can have the product refunded. The cost of return shipping would not be worth the trouble in this case. So my experience is less than satisfactory."
3,complete,"I wish it was metal, but it is still cute and matches the rest of the set, so it completes the look."
4,Rubinstein Plays Tchaikovsky and Grieg,"This recording of the Grieg Concerto (Rubinstein's second in stereo, and his second collaboration with Alfred Wallenstein in the work) was one of his favorite recordings. It remains one of my all time favorite recordings of this composition as well, and the remastered sonics are beautiful--they always were! The BSO collaboration with Leinsdorf in the Tchaikovsky does not seem as impactful as when first I heard it. One reason, I think, is that the remastered sonics are not quite as successful. The performance, too, strikes me as a bit more reserved than I once thought it. Nothing wrong here, and a Cd well worth owning."
5,Another outstanding Serengeti buy,"Just received my new ""Lamone"" Drivers and they are fantastic. Ultra-light weight, perfect fit and outstanding Serengeti quality. I expected and got nothing less.This is my third pair of Serengeti Drivers since the late 1980's. I still have my original ""Aviators"" and am now retiring my ""Rutgers"" model that I've worn for about the past 10 years. I highly recommend the Serengeti line of sunglasses products.There are several Serengeti lens types from which to choose, which may at first be a little daunting to a newcomer (I still prefer the original non-polarized Drivers - use the Serengeti web site to help you select a lens) but I am convinced that you cannot go wrong with any selection.Well worth the investment; treat them well and you will get decades of comfort and satisfaction. Five stars."
5,Excellent glasses for flying and driving,"I have used Serengeti glasses for years for flying and I think they are the best! Got this new pair recently and I am not disappointed. They are very effective, comfortable and nice looking. Love them!"
5,Excellent suglasses.,I bought my sunglasses through Amazon but the order was handled by another web site. I had Maui Jim sunglasses and I thought I had lost them. I found them after ordering these Serengeti sunglasses and I had planned on returning them once they they were shipped to me. But after trying them for a week I decided to keep them. These sunglasses are very comfortable and the clarity through the lenses is excellent. They're light weight due to the plastic lenses but that is probably why they are so comfortable. The lenses are slightly lighter in darkness than my Maui Jim sunglasses but I haven't had any problems with using them under any driving conditions. A low morning sun or low evening sun with the reflected light is handled easily. The fit of the s-flex frames is great for me. I adjusted the nose pads slightly and they were good to go.I highly recommend these sunglasses to anyone.
5,STILL THE BEST & INCREDIBLE PRICE AT AMAZON!!,"Been wearing Serengetis for years not and although these were much too big for me, it killed me to send them back at this price & specs, otherwise they were EXACTLY what I wanted: Rose gradient color, Photochromatic, high contrast for driving and VERY HARD TO FIND TEMPERED GLASS YOU CAN ONLY GET FROM SERENGETI!! STILL MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITES AND MY QUEST TO FIND A PAID THAT WILL FIT MY SMALL FACE CONTINUES...this is an UNBELIEVABLE PRICE FOR THESE and they are by far MUCH BETTER THAN THE OVER PRICED MAUI JIMS!!** GOOD LUCK!!** :) :)"
5,Serengeti Lamone Drivers Sunglasses,I recived the item on estimated time. the product quality and price are excellent. 5 stars for this customer very recommendable.
3,A great southern comfort in BEULAH LAND,"I'd give this collection three stars for the depth of knowledge of the author and the way in which the people are depicted. The characters in Beulah Land are all sympathetic and the author treats them as such.I found parts of this book hard to read and because I am a friend of a friend of the author have this to say: If you are looking to expand your readership base, then tone it down. Not many people are willing to spend time reading and rereading trying to decide if the writer is super-smart or being deliberately obtuse.Overall, I think the collection shows a lot of promise and definitely is worth the time."
4,A great start for a writer with this collection,"There are so many writers that start out by writing fictionalized accounts of their own lives. This collection is so diverse and well-thought out and I'm impressed. Not very many first books get beyond the annoying coming of age teenage thing. This one does. Indians, cowboys, farmers, morticians and trappers. It's got a lot of great and memorable characters. Even a Key West setting. I was satisfied with my copy of the book."
1,"Anybody want to buy a signed, half-read used copy?","I couldn't even get halfway through this book. The generic book design (cover, etc.) and the ridiculously high pricing should've been the tip off -- obvious vanity press.The writing is just so bland and bloodless; lightweight ""MFA writing"" all the way. Anyway, I have one word: beware.I was trying to be nice, so I bought this book as favor. My question now is: where can I get a refund?"
4,Worth buying for 6-8 year olds,"Really taught great things for children 6-8. For anyone older than that, it was a bit too young."
3,My son enjoyed it,"I thought that most that was written in the book, children already know, I was looking for more on table manners, but my son enjoyed it ...."
4,Good for kids with autism,"I'm a school psychologist working with a group of middle-school boys who have Autism and I'm using this book as a text book, more or less, for a social skills group. The kids like it and I like it. The structure is good - starts slow and safe, talking about manners, then gets into the more sensitive issues about hygiene and girls, then comes back to safer issues to wrap up."
3,"manners for boys, if they sit long enough to read it.","A Little Book of Manners for Boys: A Game Plan for Getting Along with OthersI don't know it just didn't appeal to me, That doesn't mean the book is no good. It just doesn't suit my needs. My 5 yr old son has behavior problems. I wanted a book that put things in a more interesting way. Here is too many words and concepts, which is probably good for older kids. But with a 5 year old with ADHD I need succinct. I'll save this and see how it plays when he gets older."
3,Great for young boys,This book was good but more for younger little boys. I bought for my 12-year old and i believe he is too young.
5,"Fab-u-lous Book to get Sons Interested in Manners. ""What's manners, Mom?""","I have sons and the oldest was five when grandma gifted this book to him. With little brother just 5 years behind him, we have another wave of 'what's manners?' inquiries. A Little Book of Manners for Boys is more of a picture book that just gets them started. It's a nice 'coffee' table book for boys. I set it out before their acquaintences come over- not for my boys. No, no! Mine are well versed in appropriate manners. It's for those monsters that they have decided to tame. HA! My sons shall certainly save the world- one boy at a time."
4,Excellent,"This album has little likeness to Gong, Daevid Allen's 1970s Cantuberry progressive band.Playbax 1980 is seventeendissonant soundscapes, short pieces featuring digital drums and keyboards, and shining, strange guitar webs. Allen sings over these angular backdrops, mostly through vocal processors, Completely otherworldly.This has nothing to do with 1970s progressive rock and everything to do with the outer limits of new wave experimentation. I like it that way. While Yes and ELP were doing retrotunes, the underground progressive artists of the 1970s, like Allenm stayed under.When you have never played an arena, there is no limit to where else you can go."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"This Cavalcade album is rilly quite lame. Dude has just lost it. The beats are always rite on, but the ambient stuff is so wack. Pretty much everything since Find Candace has been a waste."
5,Great Conditioner,"Through all the different conditioners I buy I keep coming back to this one. It's thick, creamy, and all natural. A little goes a long way. Lavender is very relaxing and helps when my dogs are a little stressed from bathing time."
5,Good Product,I like this product. I use both the shampoo and conditioner on my Blue Weimaraner and it leaves her smelling clean and coat very shiny and healthy looking.
3,Pretty good,"I like this product. It doesn't lather very well, so I have to use a lot and I only have a small Yorkie, but most conditioners don't lather like shampoo does. Other than that I love it."
1,just don't work,I buy it and try it. But it just didn't work. I'm very sure that the vga slot on my laptop and the dvi slot on my screen is fine.
1,Doesn't work,"The converter doesn't work, regardless of what kind of DVI cable I used. I also tried using it for multiple other things just to see if it wasn't working with something specific. Still got nothing. Thankfully, I only paid $3."
5,A Great Post War II look at movers and shakers in Germany,"I ran across the title of this book when studying David Hockney's work. Hockney made a trip to China with this author which produced, ""China Diary"". Same right on razor sharp observations that he made in writing European Witness almost 50 years before. Was particularly impressed with Spender's interview with Dr Adenauer. Dr. Adenauer started rebuilding his city first with the schools, then the architecture. Guess that's why he went on to succeed in national politics."
3,This book is BORING,Ok guys if you don't enjoy reading THAT much then just forget about this book. This book is good for learning but I am falling asleep reading it. It is hard to understand and following through the head making excercise was a huge pain in the ..... for me. If you enjoy reading and you want to learn 3D STUDIO MAX this is for you If you want to learn the program but you don't like to read that much then find a simpler book because this one is hard to read :(
2,Where are the NURBS?,"I saw this book and its reviews and hoped it would actually be ""In Depth"" coverage of 3D Studio. The main reason I bought the book was for help using the NURBS surfaces, this page barely has over twenty pages of NURBS information. The NURBS info that is provided is the same information I found in the program's help files. If anyone knows of a book that actually goes in depth with NURBS please email me. Schliz_King@yahoo.com. Thanks"
4,"Factory-Reconditioned KitchenAid Pro Line Burr Coffee Grinder, Empire Red",I am very pleases with the quality and performance of this burr grinder. It works as advertised.
5,Excellent Recording!!!,"As other reviewers have noted, it might not be the best *total* performance of Elijah (although it's still VERY good)....but Terfel gives the best Elijah performance that I've ever heard. If you haven't heard this recording, you are definitely missing out."
1,Mendelssohn-Elija/Terfel,"This is one of the worst recordings I have ever purchased from Amazon. Many tracks of this sublime music are inaudible. Fortunately the music is ""there"". With about 8 hours of work, one can remaster the disks to produce a fine recording, but I would not recommend this for most people."
1,Not Performed In The Proper Key!,"Hard to believe. The recording is more than a half tone below the score as written by Mendelssohn. I've checked my equipment (both CD player and instruments) and the conclusion is inescapable. A DDD recording would normally accurately reproduce the original performance. If that's true, it would mean that the entire work was transposed. Is it conceivable that the Edinburgh Festival Chorus would treat such a timeless work with such disdain? Doubtful. However it happened, if it matters to you that you hear the work in the written key, DON'T BUY THIS recording. There are others that are true to the composer."
4,Good Enough.,"I'm generally not into jazz, and definetely not hip hop, but this whold CD is worth buying for ""Plenty"" with Erykah Badu. Fantastic track, even if it does have rap in it. Guru has lyrical flow, which IMO is unmatched by most rappers today. Applause for this CD. Buy it!"
3,It's really 3 3/8 stars........,"Guru, has done a good job in putting together this album. With people like Donnell Jones and Erykah Badu lighting up a new kind of flava for this type of music.Rap? Soul? Jazz? R&B?....call it what you want. Call it all that if may, with the session including Donnell Jones, you go back to those days....playa, you know what I'm talkin' about. Then you chill out with Erykah, soundin' like Billie Holiday. Cool and Hot at the same time.Good album, Great artists, thanks Guru."
2,Desappointing...,"I'm one of Gang Starr's biggest fans, from day one. The Jazzmatazz's vol.1 was huge, undisputed ! The Jazzmatazz's vol.2 was great. This volume is just a good rap album. There's no 'jazzic' dimension in it. Even the true Gang Starr vibes aren't here ! This cd is an average 2000' rap alum, with nothing new, nothing original. Just some well produced material. Is it a loss of inspiration or a will for more gain ? Guru only knows. I'm truly desappointed..."
3,Its not the best but not the worst,He has songs that are sweet and some you have to fast forward. I like a few on this album but I wished I would have saved my money. Nothing is more sweet the Moment of Truth:Gangstarr(98) I dont think they will ever get back to that level. My opinion!
4,"A Brilliant Effort by Guru, Unlimited Gifts","Guru is a most wonderful MC and his conception of jazz=hip-hop is masterful. On the other hand, it's going to be more interesting to see what direction he goes off on.The instrumental production is quite superb and more hardcore. It's certainly better than the second one of the series and it delivers a true fusion of hip-hop and jazzy funky rhythms. The tracks are all solid but the fact that virtually samples weren't used prevented this from being a perfect album. However I will highlights tracks with Angie Stone, Nubians, and Herbie Hancock as the highlights which have the dopest instrumentals and brilliant rhymes.Remember that Guru provides a positive outlook of life. It's nice to see a brother encouraging the youth to try something good for community. Few are brave enough to recognize true leadership when it's needed most..."
5,Loved It,What a great lyrical work! Lots of really great tunes with stellar talent like Erykah Badu and Macy Gray. This could probably be the soundtrack of the year!
2,Whatmatazz?,"If a bunch of decent beats ruined by wack (with a few exceptions) R&B hooks is your idea of Jazzmatazz, check this out. If not stick to Volume One, where there was actually some jazz cats on the album. Premier, help your man out, it's time for a new Gangstarr album."
3,my names CXCXCXCXC and I love Jay Dee,"I want to have 10,000 of his babies.. oh I mean he did a great song on this album. Certified is just way too cool, I am still not sure if it is good music. But the beat is great. and I get the feeling that I am supposed to really like Bilal.oh, guru should have let Shade Sheist do the rapping. I honestly would have liked this album so much more if he wasn't on it. what a letdown.Keep your Worries is a cool song and the girls who dance in the video are nice. everything else is never gonna heard by my ears again.. get Jazzmatazz one!!"
2,"The third, and worst, of the projects","Easily the worst of the Jazzmatazz projects. Doesn't even really sound like Jazz at all, anywhere. It's more an R&B Neo-soul project.Now if you're into that kind of thing, it's probably a good album. I found a few songs to be good but overall it's just too much of a departure from the whole concept of Jazz-meets-HipHop for me."
3,Coul have been fleshed out a bit more,"This is not a bad book; it's just not a very good one. There is a need for a monograph on the Sveshnikov. The books by Krasenkov (The Sveshnikov Sicilian) and by Neverov and Marusenko (New Ideas in the Sveshnikov Sicilian), though very good, were published in 1996.Some of the games in McDonald's book have been taken from Neverov and Marusenko. This is legitimate since the games are of theoretical importance. Other games seem to have been taken from Chess Informant. Again legitimate. The notes McDonald provides are instructive. Quite a few of the games annotated were played subsequent to 1996 and therefore won't be found in the earlier books. All fine so far. But why only one chapter for the 9.Nd5 line? It merits more than 21 pages.The coverage is a bit too sparse. Perhaps the publisher put a limit on the number of pages.In summary, an OK book, and one to add to your shelf if you're a Sveshnikov player. Pity it doesn't have more coverage."
5,My boyfriend loved this DVD!,"I haven't watched it because I gave it to my boyfriend for Christmas, but he was very happy with it. Item was exactly as described and shipped quickly. No complaints!"
1,This is trash,"It is a load of weak beats, naive lyrics and cannot hold up. The farther in you go, the weaker this gets. I threw away 18 gazeto's on this album, expecting hot tracks. Aight, thre were some hot tracks, but also some serious bull."
5,Scar face at his best,"The album starts with a deep rumble ( Get your self a couple of 12s and a decent amp } then tempos up to a baby crying (Him) and just rocks!!! from there on. Between Scarface, Erick Sermon and Korupt they rock this album. If you don,t mind the harsh language and the gratuitous mentions of ""Thug Life"" I believe you will not only enjoy this record ;but, cherish it. After ""The Conspiracy Theory"" the album drops off in lieu of filler music. Although, by the time it gets to track No.9..... it wont matter. Like Mr. Scarface says "" Lets take it to the ring Ole Ho Ass Ni%#@ ! Come On !!!! Buy this ....it is well worth it!!"
5,"Amazing, book I need help starting with my son.",I thought this book was wonderful and plan on making it part of our lives. My second child is 7 years old and is having some problems in class and at home. Our doctor recommended your books and I would like more help organizing the info and starting a program for our son. He is a wonderful child and I believe this will help him alot
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for gift, but when I recieve it, I was very disapointed. The pendant looks so cheap and very very thin. No one believe that it is made by 14k white gold and worth for over $100. So Don't ever buy it. Not worth it."
4,great funk but is this jazz?,"This is one of the most fun albums I've picked up in a long time. The guy is amazing, he literally speaks through his instrument. There's no doubt that Scofield, Frisell, and Metheny are going to be(or already are)the jazz guitar influence of the future. But, this album like Bill's ""Nashville"" and Pat's ""Map of the World"" has very little to do with jazz. That is not a bad thing! Jazz snobs should remember, good music is good music, and this is great stuff. If you want to hear soulful grooves and some incredibly funky guitar then pick this up now! If you're after Sco playing jazz then you may want to check out ""Time on my Hands"" or Joe Henderson's ""Musings for Miles"" Both albums are Sco at his best in a ""jazz"" context."
4,"tune in, turn on, groove out","i got an ""demo"" disk of this cd after a phish concert, me and my friends were walking to my car and this dude was like hey come here i have free cds. He gave us this cd, and a south african native band demo disk. This cd is really good and if you like mmw, youll appreciate it. but if you dont its still cool."
1,Dull.,I must be missing something--but this just isn't in the same league as Electric Outlet or Still Warm or Blue Matter. I thought track #2 had some moments but for the most part he just noodles over one or two chords.
1,Bump this off your want list - it's a bust,"This CD is a colossal disappointment. I don't know what these other reviewers were hearing, but let me assure you that this is a *horrible* CD. I'm actually a Sco fan, and have seen him live. That makes the low quality of this CD all the more shocking. The soloing seems surprisingly timid and unsure. There are several *obvious* errors, really offensive to the ear, which I cannot believe were recorded as a good take. I would expect better from a high-school garage band, to be honest. Even worse are the guitar tones, which are thin, scratchy, and brutally annoying. The songs are dull, with little variety. My last ride in a public elevator provided more musical enjoyment. If you somehow get stuck listening to this disc in its entirety, I advise calling 911 immediately, or you will risk permanent damage to your ears."
3,Scofield in Form Once Again,"After reading some of the negative reviews posted about this album, I bought it to see what all the fuss was about. I must say that I thought Bump was a great CD, laying down Headhunter-like grooves, laced with Scofield's trademark guitar, sounding like an Ostrich being strangled, put through a distortion pedal.Being a big fan of Au Go Go, I felt Bump follows on nicely from the ideas started in the previous album, though the songs suffer from the absence of MMW, who really pushed Au Go Go to a new level.My favourite track is ""Blackout"", whick is a totally cool funk trip.""We are not alone"" is wierd alien-sounding stuff. ""Three Sisters"" and ""Beep Beep"" are driving grooves with Scofield's absolutely cool solos leaving enough space to make these tracks really atmospheric.I though this was a great album, and don't agree at all with reviews that refer to this as anti-music."
5,A little piece of funk heaven,"This is one of Scofield's best albums, pure and simple. The one star reviews here are clearly the product of someone with an axe to grind against Scofield. To say that there are no defined tunes - c'mon; ""Chichon"" and ""We Are Not Alone"" are more through-composed than anything he's ever done. And Scofield's tone here is incredible! I honestly cannot get enough of it. Anyone who finds Scofield's playing on this album tentative or mistake ridden is clearly not really listening. The album is getting good critical notices in the press, so please don't ignore this album simply because one person feels the need to trash music that he or she doesn't really seem to understand."
5,THIS GUY HAS NO LIMITS!,"Scofield continues to redefine the boundaries of jazz with this gritty masterpiece. Less funk than the wonderful A Go Go, this neverless takes Sco deeper into grooves which skirt the border of techno and garage rock and proves he has some of the best chops in the business. Standouts are 'Chichon' 'Kelpers' and 'Swinganova', though there's not a lousy tune here.Though no one writes a catchy melody like Pat Metheny, Scofield is the king of rhythm and grooves when it comes to jazz guitar. These two guys are leaving the competition way behind them. Highly recommended."
2,Not the best for Sco,"Bump seems to be a pretty uninspired Scofield release. I've seen him live, been following him since Still Warm and must say, this CD won't make my wish list. It almost seems like he was fulfilling a contractual obligation. This lacks the exciting freshness and excitement that many Scofield records have. Even bad Sco is ok but for his level of ability and history, I gave it a 2 star rating."
3,"I give it a ""B"" for effort","First, let me say that I started following Sco's career when he toured with Zawinul in the ""Weather Update"" band in the early 1980's. I appreciate what he's trying do: stretch the limit of his sound. He's always finding new and inventive players to jam with.That said, this album is a misstep. His compositions aren't fully realized, and the overall instrumentation on the album is lacking (is it just me, or does one wonder what the inclusion of keys or a sax would have done to the gravity of this cuts?)Sco is still the man, that modal stuff he plays still intrigues with its phrasing. But this album seems incomplete. His fans expect more. And I guarantee you he won't have this guitar/bass/drums/percussion line-up on his next album."
5,Infectious Tunes,I heard a couple of tracks from this on the radio and wanted to hear more. So I bought this CD and it just grows and grows on me. This is Joe's finest effort in my opinion. So fine in fact that someone stole it from me. I hope they enjoy it as much as I have.
2,Cute but not a serious book.,"A friend recommended this book and it has some interesting sections, but misses the mark in many areas. For example, many major works of art are missing and many important figures in Italian and Italian-American history."
4,a great gift,"I'm not Italian, but the book is a perfect gift for someone who is. The real beauty of the book is in its prose. The authors' genuine love of the Italian culture comes through in the poetry of the written word."
4,Brief But Informative.,"The authors give more than 101 reasons for ""Italian Pride."" From Amore{love| to Wine dozens of tidbits are here to wet the appetite for more in depth research. For that alone I give it 3 stars. I give it 4 overall because it paints a mosaic of all the myriad fields that Italians have contributed to. It is divided into four parts. ""Culture & History, Places, People, & Food. Each part has twenty or more briefchapters of 2-4 pages.Various topics of interest include ""Scientists, Italian Jews, Soccer, Verona{the most Roman city outside of Rome}, Italian women like Maria Montessori, the fine composer Verdi, to the regional cultural & culinary styles. This will be a good introduction for those people unfamiliar with anything Italian, especially good for kids."
3,Basic but fine,I found this book to be well written. Anyone wanting to get a general idea on what the Italian culture brought to us all will find this basic compilation quite useful. Its also a good coffee table addition.
5,AAAA+,"It is what it claims to be, a book on Italian pride. I bought several and gave them to my kids for Christmas and they loved the book."
5,great gift,"Although I haven't read it, I know the contents and will make a great Christmas gift for my girl friend."
1,Price = Quality,The price reflects the quality. Large inclusions visible with the naked eye at 5-ft away render this a poor gift to give to a lady. Prompt refund made the disappointment a quick memory though.
3,"Not Bad, but not Great either","With Weis and Hickman being the authors, I was looking forward to this book (series). While it by no means is a bad story, I really wasn't all that impressed. It was good enough for me to follow up by reading the following two books, but there are many other books I would reccomend for reading."
2,Rather a disappointment,"Being a fanatic for Margaret's & Tracy's books, I was rather disappointed with this one. There is no comparison to the Dragonlance Saga or the Death Gate novels. The plot develops very slowly and even though someone would say that this is because the characters are being built up, I never felt any familiarity with any of the heroes. They seemed distant,I did not feel any bad or good or whatever feelings for them.They were indifferent to me(that's a bad thing!) I felt that Margaret and Tracy only repeated themselves, without having the spark of inspiration.They gave me the impression that someone forced them to write the book. Of course, I will surely buy the second volume when it will be released (it's an addict!), but they will have to do much better to convince me to buy the third one!"
1,Well of Boredom,"I love Weis and Hickman.....at least I used to. The changing of historical dispositions for the races was the only inspired thing in this book. Its one of the few times I don't want to read the sequels. I think its funny that the reviews are either great or abysmal and if you want to see for yourself, get it from the library!!!"
3,Overrated,"First off, I'm a true Weis and Hickman fan, I love almost all their works except perhaps Rose of the Prophet which is a bit uneven, but I digress ;-)This book starts slow, runs slow, and ends slow. It reads like an entire book of prologue and indeed it is, as the 2nd and 3rd books take place decades later.Go back and reread Dragonlance Chronicles or Legends or even the Darksword trilogy and you'll know what I'm talking about. This book is by far the worst that they have written. That said, it is at least on par with Terry Goodkind (but that's another review for another day--talk about overrated!)3 Stars because it's Weis and Hickman...really 2 stars though"
2,Disappointing,"Until now, I thought MW&TH; were incredibly and consistently good in a genre that is often very formulaic, and that often seems to aim for plot instead of story. I decided to pick up Well of Darkness without even knowing anything about it except it was written by MW&TH.;Ugh, what happened?? Maybe, just maybe, I will still look for a loaner from the library, but even that might not be worth it. Ironic that the story was about the Void, because that is exactly what the book gave back -- no life, no nothing. One of the elements I really enjoy from their books is losing myself in the other worlds, where the the magic and the characters and the races and everything takes on a life of their own. This book just does not have ""it""."
4,Really Good Book,"I've got only two small nits with this book. First, the characters seem to be somewhat stilted in behavior. However, it's very possible this is just a function of the genre. It's not all that bad, but it is noticeable. Second, throughout the book, Good is usually depicted as being somewhat stupid, and Evil is not necessarily portrayed as bad, but instead is portrayed as somewhat clever. I guess it's a philosophical difference between me and the authors (or what they're trying to do with this series). Overall, though, the book is still very well done. I enjoyed it."
4,Well Written Fantasy,"I always look forward to a new book by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. I've been fans of theirs since their early DragonLance days. This book was no exception. The beginning of this book did move along rather slowly, but for me, learning about the world and the races made up for that. After the book got going, I found myself lost in it. I eagerly await the next book in the series."
5,Not a typical game knockoff,"I expect the worst when I read a novel based on a game system. Too often, we have heros hacking their way through dungeons and picking up gold. WELL OF DARKNESS delves into people (including non-human people), lets us sympathize both with those following good and those following evil, and integrates a complete look into the history of its world and its people without stepping out of the story line."
2,The Well Runs Dry,"The institution of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman have produced in Well of Darkness the beginnings of a promising series. Though I didn't like the new take on Dwarves and the new take on Orcs, the Elven society is interesting enough to make up for them. As for the story, there isn't one until the final seventy-five pages. Up to that point, the book reads like a role-playing game guide... and, that's kind of what it is, having been simultaneously released with the Sovereign Stone gaming system.As readers of fantasy know, Margaret and Tracy aren't Tolkein split in half; but they're not schlock-king Piers Anthony either. Well of Darkness is long and somewhat boring, but ends in a way that seems to hint... hey, the next one's gonna be really good. And believe me, good or not, the next one will be very different, as the town of Vinnengael and its Dominion Lords are turned completely upside down. I'm tempted to bump this review up to three just out of curiousity."
2,"standard fare, not particularly well done",I gave the book to my brother to make sure I wasn't missing something. He agreed.
2,Boring:this is not a MW&TC book,"Hey, what is it with you guys? I have been reading the reviews and I am really surprised that you rate it so high.I am a very loyal fan of Margaret and Tracey's books, I have read most of their books as well as some of Margaret's solos but this one was disappointing. Very slow development in the plot, I could not ""link"" with any of the characters, I never felt like not-being-able-to-put-it-down. I have not found anything new in this book.I agree with some other reviewers, the end looks promising,but I am still under the impression that MW&TC wrote it just to sell and not because they had something new and exiting to say."
3,Oooop's in the book,The recipe's in the book are great but my copy of the book was the end of the printer roll of paper so some pages are indented with dots and some pages have a blue strip of paper right through them... so the content of the book is great the printer not so much....
4,A Good Read,What I love the most about this cook book are the tips on how to improve already great recipes. Learning about the history of Juniors was a bonus.
3,nothing spectacular,"I bought this book hoping to be able to make a great cheesecake. I made the marble cheesecake and quite honestly I thought that it [was awful]! I would have expected better from juniors, which is know for it's cheesecakes. I will give it one compliment, the corn muffin recipe is great and it is the only reason that I gave it 3 stars because I was not happy with any other recipes from this book."
5,Much more than a cookbook!!!,"I just loved reading this ""cookbook"". The recipes all look so good. I already made the Deepdish Blueberry Pie and their pastry recipe, it was WONDERFUL.I even told some co-workers about these recipes. Now, I just wish I could go to Brooklyn and eat at Juniors. Maybe someday."
5,This book is MUST BUY - you won't be sorry!,"This is a great book of how Brooklyn was and is. Whether you live in Brooklyn or not, you become part of the area with the stories and pictures and the WONDERFUL recipes! If you like cheesecake, this is the book for YOU!! It doesn't get any better than this!!"
1,Expected more from Seiko,"The positive - the watch has an attractive appearance and keeps accurate time.The negative - the battery gradually loses its ability to maintain a charge and costs a lot to be replaced. The first year or so that I had the watch the battery would charge quickly and hold its charge for a decent length of time but by the time it was five years old, the watch would stop if it was not worn for a couple of days. Eventually it would only run while it was being agitated. I would far prefer a watch with a battery that costs two or three dollars and could be changed easily. It costs more than fifty dollars to have this one replaced."
2,A disapointing follow-up to a great first album,"If you know what's good for you, you won't buy this album because you liked the first one. The only thing that N17 has maintained is heaviness, everything else about this sophmore attempt is completely worthless. Only one or two tracks even start out with any potential only to lose it in the first minute. Every track goes absolutly nowhere. If they would have tried to break things down once in a while it could help dramatically. This is the first album that I knew would never even have a chance of growing on me. I'd maybe recommend buying a single if they release one, but a whole album of this is just plain boring."
1,What is this? They call this music?,"This has to be the worst noise I've heard in years. I suggest buying something with musical talent, because it is not here. I've met this band and may I say they are pretentious. The ""guitarist"" Chris boasts more talent than he actually possesses and as a person I find him arrogant and rude."
3,1929 World Premiere Recording of THE RITE OF SPRING,"This was the first recording of the classic Stravinsky ballet score - LE SACRE DU PRINTEMPS (THE RITE OF SPRING), released on a series of 12 inch 78 rpm discs. I was curious about it, both from an historical perspective and because I consider his performance of the truncated score in Disney's FANTASIA to be one of two favorite performances (the other is Pierre Monteux's 1949 recording).This is a great surprise for Stokowski's initial interpretation is quite different - it is far slower than the 1939 interpretation (for the 1940 film release) and the dynamics are also quite different. It is as if two completely different conductors interpreted the work. As such it is a fascinating companion piece to the FANTASIA soundtrack performance.The discs are in amazing condition, considering their age. Sound is tinny but the remastering does bring out some otherwise previously inaudible bass lines. A real must-have for fans of the Stravinsky ballet."
4,shorty muffler,"I pulled the reasonator out of the muffler (this is a serviceable part on this muffler) only to find no packing in the muffler whatsoever. This may be the way the muffler is normally offered, but I had always assumed this was a conventional style glass-packed muffler. the retaining wire used to wrap around the fiberglass batting was there, but no batting at all. I had some batting, so I wrapped it up and reinstalled the resonator, and went on about my business. It gave it a less harsh tone than it previously.This muffler is loud and open flowing. I have it on a 125 single cylinder cafe bike. It sounds great. Performance remained the same, if not even a tad more mid range. I did not notice any different spark plug coloring, signaling the carb needed adjustment with the muffler, atleast in my application."
5,Why I like your merchancise,"I have been looking for years for the Jack McDuff album Silken soul. There used to be a radio show late at night from Chicago called Sid and Evonne They played the tune 'Silk and Soul' from this album. Loved it. Now, thanks to you I have it. I like your place of business and will be back sometime.RLH"
5,Great,Great movie. My kids love it and watch it over and over. It captures their attention. They have never sat still thru any movie.
1,Let the past stays in the past...ough!,"If you are an old school lover, go for this one. If you are below 35 years old, go check out some other in the Recomendation link of the Amazon Page..."
5,The real story of Viet Nam,A really great and creative way to tell the story of one of the worst periods of the VietNam war for the Marines. Once again the Government enlistment a lot of our boys hang out to die. Marines were the hardest fighting troops with the worst equipment. The author almost makes you feel you are there.
4,TET 68,"I really found this book interesting, I was dug in, about 20 ks out of Saigon, during TET.We were getting news that the Marines were really copping it at Khe Sanh, for 42 years I have been wanting to know the story, being in a firebase and surrounded, for a week, I realize how easy we had it compared to these Marines .A Patch of Ground, has answered my questions, I would reccommend it.Well done MARINES"
5,Futility Best Expressed,"The fifth star is rated because the author is accurate in describing boot camp, transitions in and away from family, and especially the futility associated with gallentry. This will take you to Khe Sanh; it will not overtly open your mind's eye to horror, it will accurately reflect how it was to live with days of very unequal moments and motivations. Mr. Archer is one most excellent writer as well. This is not a lot of jingo. It remains true to its/his intent."
4,Very insightful,"Well written and easily read, this book tells the story in a way that entertains and enlightens. The authors honest account of his service is an enjoyable read."
2,Quick run through of Ferrari F1 up to 1998,"At Amazon.com, the publish date of this book is March 1999 but it is actually November 1998.This is only a small book and do not expect much detail in the history of Ferrari F1. If you are a busy man and just want a quick run through, this will help.Ferrari F1 fans, skip this one. I don't think you will get any excitement from reading this book. If you look for content, this one is lacking. If you look for colorful pictures, there are only some average ones."
1,Hated this baby book - Watch out when you write!,"After finding out we were having a boy we went boy crazy! We purchased the Blue Booties Record Book, Calendar AND Memory Box. Thinking I could get ahead I opened the baby book and started writing...BE CAREFUL! The texture of the pages has a coating on it which does not appear to allow ink to set properly. I used a traditional ink pen which smudged on all of the pages. Also, when I wrote on one side and closed the book, the ink transfered to the opposite side. I was HEART-BROKEN. For our daughter, we had purchased the looseleaf memory book which I much prefer. You can take out the pages to write carefully, add photos, momentos, etc. and you know your pages will be safe from smudges and ink runs. I'm arranging to return the entire ""Blue Booties"" set and have already purchased the CR Gibson ZOOPHABET set instead."
3,Cute book but the ink does smear,I found this book and immediately bought it for our son. I was disappointed when I discovered that the ink smears and the writing transfers to the page underneath unless you put something in between the pages. I'm really not happy with the way it looks and plan to purchase a different book.
3,Not at all what you expect,"This is not at all what I expected, and I have to admit being disappointed when I first popped this in my CD player. I'm not going to dissect this album, I think one's appreciation of art is diminished by too much analysis. The only thing I can say is that Shango never gets going; So many promising beginnings, but each and every song loses steam, and each is a disappointment, because you can FEEL the possibilities, and then they're gone.At the end of this album, I felt a sense of loss. Not because I had any real build-up going into it... I'm a Juno Reactor fan, and their other albums are among my all-time favorites, but I don't pay too much attention. I felt loss created solely by this album, it's musical promises, each broken before then end of each track.Good mindless beats, but lacks the fine craftmanship that past albums have shared. Not a bad album on its own... Just don't compare it to its siblings. Not great either."
3,"Original, but I liked Bible Of Dreams alot better","With each album, Juno Reactor shows a significant change in their style of music. Shango, their most recent release, is yet another step further away from the pure techno formula they have used in the past. Now the music has a more cultural sound with various samples including tribal vocals and even guitars. This is not a bad thing, but I favor the darker, more electronic sound found on their previous album, Bible Of Dreams (which I consider to be one of the best albums of all time). As a result, I was somewhat dissapointed with Shango. So if you liked Bible Of Dreams, you may want to listen to this album first before purchasing it, because it is different in certain aspects."
4,Pretty Decent,"This is a pretty decent album. Definitely worth a listen, even if it's not likely to be world changing for you."
5,THIS IS A MUST-HAVE !,"This album by Juno Reactor proves that techno/trance music can be much more than an insipid club music intended solely for dancing... All the tracks are great, in very different styles : Pistolero and Masters Of The Universe are fast, while Nitrogen pt. 1, Solaris and Song For Ancestors are really calm and relaxing (still, they retain the ""Juno touch""...) Shango is a work of art that every electronic music fan must own !"
2,Meh.,"Hmm, electronica mixed with world music, no one's ever thought of that one before! This should be more like two and a half stars. Pistolero, Solaris and Masters of the Universe are really the only good songs on the album. Badimo is just rather obnoxious after a while and the rest of it is just forgettable trance. Bible of Dreams is their best work, go for that one."
3,Juno's been better,"I love Juno reactor, but was dissapointed by this album. The first track is stunning and one or two others are solid. But really, excepting that first track ""Pistolero"", pretty much any other Juno Reactor album is vastly superior. If you really love Pistolero, just buy the Cd-single. You'll be much happier with all the versions of that song than you will be with this album. I only recommend Shango for hard core Juno Reactor fans that just have to have all their music."
3,be warned: description of this cd does not match its name,"The image and name of this cd (Carmina) does not match its contents, which is a description of the ""Gems of Celtic Story 3"". ""Carmina"" is a quite different project by Robin Williamson and his wife Bina."
5,Very Tasty..,Absolutely delicious. Very crispy and fresh. And you can't beat this price. They come in a poly bag and you can fill them in some smaller containers and use as you need. They stay fresh for a long time. Indeed a very healthy snack alternative.
2,You get what you pay for,"I don't know if all these wonderful reviews are from people who work for this company, but I would never recommend these! I love Hapi Snack's Wasabi Peas, but they're expensive and hard to find. I was thrilled when I saw these. However, they have a strange ""fake"" taste and worst of all, they are like eating rocks - LITERALLY! Every fourth or fifth pea I tried to eat was a solid rock. I actually chipped my tooth. My dental work is going to cost me a lot more than what I saved on these. They're not that hot, either. If you like Wasabi Peas try some other brand. These are not worth the $11+ shipping. I've never left a negative review like this before. But buyer beware."
5,To my ex-coworker,This book was written very well. The story it tells comes across very honest and candid. The most important message it conveys is that we should never ignore the warning signs of child abuse.
4,A worth reading book for managers,"THE IBM WAY is a book by Buck Rodgers, VP marketting of IBM. This is a must read book for all professionals, who want to enter into the field of marketting, human relations or other processes, as managers in future. It tell us the inside story about the building blocks which laid the firm foundation of the Big Blue, which is IBM, today, the world's one of the largest company. Buck Rodgers has poured all his experience with IBM in this book. The book describes the IBM's journey over so many years starting from the scratch and reaching at the top. Buck has quoted various incidences from his life in IBM, which educate a reader about the basic human relations principles. For marketting persons, it proves as a guide on crisis management."
3,"Useful with a GPS, but not as accurate as one would expect...","In our recent trip to Portugal, I took my Powerbook, a USB GPS and the Route 66 Europe 2004 software. Portugal seems to be one of the least mapped countries of the EU, but Route 66 did have all the main roads - albeit slightly outdated - in it.It helped to see our location on the map and even when we weren't able to follow the particular route the software plotted, we could tell we were in the general right direction. The GPS is a must!But, at least in Portugal, when you stray from the main cities, you are basically on your own. And in the main cities, things have changed so much from the maps in the package (I write this on Summer 2005) that you could easily spend a good chunk of time on a road just to realize you were really driving on a bridge over where you were supposed to be.So, for Portugal (only place I tested it), useful - yes, very much so. Definitive guide - no."
1,ZZZ....,"This movie is so bad. They hit all the high points of the book of Acts but it does bring the book of Acts to life at all. The acting is mediocre, the script is terrible and they added things that they shouldn't have. I was bored and wandered off halfway through the movie. I am a full on born again Christian and love the bible. I really tried to like this movie but I am sorry, it's just bad."
2,Snowy more than half of the time,"The product, ""Paul, The Emissary"" is not the film I have seen in the past on TBN. I am sorry it was not the production I have seen before. The problem is that more than half the time, viewing was difficult because it was snowy more than half the time.Very disappointed.Shirley Stauffer"
3,Paul: The Emissary-DVD,I thought the movie was good but maybe not totally accurate. Did Paul stay in the jail? I thought he walked out and went to the home of the deciples that were praying for him.
3,The Emissary,"I was disappointed that the DVD came in a sleeve instead of a case, I was also extremely disappointed in the fact that I was charged $2.98 for s/h and when the package came they had paid $1.44postage and I was presented with a postage due of $1.07...to me this was totally unacceptable compared to all my other orders."
4,A brilliant gross-out,"Not to be taken seriously, guys. A brilliant gross-out of a novel. This is pulp stuff, as whacky as Harry Shannon's brilliant 2002 novel ""Night of the Beast,"" and taken in the right spirit 'Wetbones' is an absolute blast. Designed to provoke nervous giggles and cries of eeeeeeeewwwwwww from the reader. Recommended."
2,Meh,"Overall, I thought this book was a pretty big disappointment. The story was nothing special and the book isn't nearly as gruesome or gory as The Bighead or Exquisite Corpse. If you're looking for a story that's really nasty and disturbing, you may as well skip this one, and if you're looking for a novel with an intriguing plot, you should still skip this one, because overall it's just a pretty big let down."
1,Disappointingly dull,"I bought this book based on the two previous reviews and am very disappointed - can this be the same book?!? The characters are one-dimensional, flat and boring; I couldn't get interested in what was happening to them. While violent and sexually graphic, the style of writing is limp and spiritless and is unable to provide descriptive support to the story. What should be shocking or exciting comes across as just blah (like reading a description out of a newspaper). After plowing through half of the book, I just gave up."
4,bloody ideas,"Oftentimes it's said that too much gore got in the way of some interesting concepts but many times I feel the reverse holds true as well. In this book a few new ideas are raised but it seems like more often then not intellectual ramblings are traded in for splatter. Though I can't say this has the perfect balance for everyone, I can definitely say that it worked well for me. With a fun and different, although not entirely new, sci-fi twist on the vampire theme it manages to stand its own. A large character list and a couple different subplots drive the story forward at a quick pace, despite a few gory entries so extensive they nearly take you out of the storyline.If your looking for a fun page/stomach turner this is a great choice. It's the first of his books that I've read... and I plan to read some more."
5,"""Wetbones""",Will take a miracle too get this book made into a movie that won't be XXX rated but even so might be worth it!!! Takes horror too a new boundry. Read the book and remember too leave an extra light on...
3,Adequate,"Some interesting concepts, but mostly just gruesome. There were some grammatical errors. It was worth the read but I don't expect I'll keep this book."
5,splatterpunk too weird for the mainstream,"_Wetbones_ by John Shirley combines the 3 Ms -murder, mutilation (to the point of maceration),and mind control into an erotic, yet extremelygraphic splatterpunk novel probably too strangefor the mainstream.A cult-like group can manipulate people bystimulating their brain centers and doling outPunishment or Reward. Several people withnothing apparent in common -- a man hung up onhis ex-wife's death via self-mutilation, anothersearching for his juvenile deliquent brother, areverend who counsels drug addicts, and anex-cult member performing grotesque murders --all find their paths crossing at the cult'scompound. At the compound they discoverunspeakable rituals and the cult's secret of mindcontrol.However, _Wetbones_ does more than just describethe horror of hacked-up human bodies; it is alsoa study of addiction and the depths of despair.Its intensity and flat out weirdness make thisbook a highly recommended read for the""slice-and-dice"" horror set."
5,Great history book,"This book tells us about the tragedy related to Napoleon's great failure of invasion to Russia and destruction of his grand army by Russian's ""General Winter""."
4,Great!,I bought these for a pageant a while back and they really doenhance your breasts and give you some great cleavage!
5,Bob Florence and friends,"This is another incredibly good CD made by what is actually the Bob Florence Tentet. Hollywood's finest jazz musicians and best arranger at work. In a just world, the Tentet (like the Hi-Lo's) would be rich and famous, and this album would not be obscure. In any case, enjoy the subtleties, the power, and the swing that lie at the heart of jazz. If you don't enjoy ""Dreamsville"" and thrill to the Carl Saunders trumpet....well, there's always the Spice Girls."
3,phone cover case,"I really enjoyed this product. My only problem with the case (but this is with all these style cases) is that the case cracked, not sure from what. Also 2 of the clips in the top part broke.I am not writing a negative review, but giving you some helpful hints to improve your cases.Thanks you!"
2,If you have a 360 don't buy this for PS3,I rented and played this game on my XBOX 360. Considering the fact that I have about 7 ps3 games and over 50 360 games I decided to by the game but to get the PS3 version to diversify my collection... BAD MOVE! The 360 version is in full high def and looked great and I was expecting the same from PS3 version however it turn out to be rendered in 720p. This made a HUGE difference in the graphics and was VERY disappointing. I've learned my lesson and for now on if a title is available on both systems I'm going with the 360 version. Sony has burned me for the last time...
3,It is okay,I expected this game to be a little better than what it is. I do not like the career mode. I think there should be a free ride mode. The graphics are not as good as other games.
1,PS2 Level Graphics,"This game has terrible graphics, poor music and controls, and pathetic sound effects. Considering how many racers there are to choose from on the Playstation 3, even a racing fan would be hard pressed to find much use out of this game. It attempts to add some extra features such as a few appearance customization options for the driver and vehicles, but considering how bad the graphics are, these features are very poorly implemented."
1,Horrible game. Just get Midnight Club: Los Angeles,"This game is awful. Horrible handling and horrible gameplay overall, bad online, bad music, and horrible graphics like PS2 graphics. Don't get Juiced 2.If you want the best Playstation 3 Street Racing game, and one of the best racing games ever, getMidnight Club: Los Angeles."
4,Real people on reels,"This resource for film history pulls together interesting facts and cast lists in an easy to read format. Whether you look through the alphabetical listing of historical people to find one famous character or just open at random and read the entries, you will come away with an appreciation of film biographies. You will realize that with 1700 films and 2800 actors credited there are a LOT of movies that have been made a real people. Film buffs will especially enjoy this book."
4,Live Aus Berlin,Live Aus Berlin being Rammstein's live album that was recorded during their 2 night show in Berlin 1998. The sound quality is great and I do not agree that the instruments are muffled as some previous reviewers have written. The booklet is very nice with crisp photographs but they could have included some liner-notes that described the tour and why the picked certain songs and such. Allmusic and Rolling Stone gave the recording 3 respectively 3.5 out of 5. I think it is a little better and give it 4. 4/5.
3,good music but bad recording,Although you can find the songs on here elsewere they have added some interesting touches to them on this album (like the intro tho Buek Dich) the quality of the rcording is pretty awfull but still a good album for the hardcore Ramms+ein fan.
3,Get Sehnsucht First,"I'm the largest Rammstein fan ever but I was disapointed with this CD. If you are a di-hard Rammstein fan it would be a good pick, but you should start off with Sehnsucht so you can hear their wrath, if you haven't yet."
2,Very poor sound quality,"It is rare, these days, to find a CD that sounds as bad as ""Live Aus Berlin."" The other Rammstein album that I own, ""Sehnsucht,"" is itself rather poorly recorded. (For an example of a German band that really knows how to produce a top-notch recording, listen to Einsturzende Neubauten's ""Tabula Rasa"" or ""Ende Neu"" album.) If you have lousy equipment, or you only listen to ""Live Aus Berlin"" in the car, you might be able to get past the poor sonic quality of the recording. If, however, you are easily perturbed by lousy recordings, you should skip ""Live Aus Berlin."""
3,great performance!,"I am not a die-hard Rammstein fan nor do I own any of their studio CDs; but this realese, Live aus Belin, caught my eye. Not only does it wrap up songs from both of their previous CDs, but it is also a demonstration of their excellent live work. The guitars are much more aggressive and direct, and the overall sound of the band becomes even deeper and darker than in the studio. Backed up by a tremendeous audience that is 100% behind the band and singing along, this recording turned out to be a great purchase. I only give it 3 stars because, as already mentioned, I am not a die-hard fan and personally I feel it is somewhat exhausting to listen to, but fun. If you like Rammstin, you WILL love this CD. Fo those who are interested, the CD is well mixed with clear audience participation and pyrotechnics in the background. The booklet is very nice too with great pictures of the band members capturing the feeling of the concert."
4,"A great alternative to the mundane worlds of rap,country,etc","While the recording quality is not perfect, this CD offers the bass-driven, heart pounding, german intensive, aural onslaught that Rammstein have become famous for. This is a must-buy!"
3,Enjoyable and energetic.,"Rammstein is a pretty cool band. I started listening to them a few months ago. Their guitar riffs are infectious, thick, and heavy. They're a German metal band that incorporates techno elements into their music. Live Aus Berlin is listenable and satisfying. Their live sound is pretty good. Live Aus Berlin is almost eighty minutes in length with fifteen songs. It's listenable from beginning to end, and the photos in the liner notes are interesting, also. My favorite tracks are ""Du Riechst So Gut"" and ""Bestrafe Mich."" It's too bad that ""Eifersucht"" isn't included, though. ""Eifersucht"" is a cool tune. ""Wilder Wein"" is an interesting track that's not on Herzeleid or Sehnsucht. It's not a bad song. Live Aus Berlin is worth a listen."
3,Till Lendenmann is a god,"Though I absolutely adore Rammstein, I must admit that this is not the best live performance I've heard from them. I saw tham last year in France, and their performance was so much better than this recording. However, Rammstein are da bomb."
5,The best of Sehnsucht and Herzeleid - together,"This CD captures all of Rammstein's best songs - all in one presented in the way that all of this band's songs should be presented - live. After listening to this CD, you should also look into buying the video. This CD mixes all their best songs and plays them back to back, with no boring or lame parts to skip over. If you haven't bought any Rammstein music before, this is the one you'll want to buy, because it doesn't get any better than this."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a good product, however I did not like it at first. We tried to put my baby in this after she was about a week old and I was afraid she would suffocate in it. Her head would flop to my chest and I couldn't tell if she was getting enough air. Also the straps would leave marks all over her tiny head. Now that she is bigger, this works great. She is able to hold her head up now so I do not have any problems. I also love the material on this, it is so much softer than other carriers. All in all this is a good product. I received it as a gift and probably would not have purchased it on my own."
3,It's an okay CD.,"The artist has some potential. The music was ok. As the album goes on, it gets boring. However, the beginning is ok."
3,Does the job,The clip does not stay on very well. I have to hold on to it while I'm frothing. The thermometer part works great.
2,Sticks,"I have another CDN thermometer that works well (the digital one) - and wanted this for my foamed milk espresso drinks.Although this item is adjustable, the wand often stalls, then jerks ahead.I have used boiling water to ck the temperature, and correct it, but It is difficult to adjust - and I consider this a waste of money."
3,too big,Way too big for at-home use with normal frothing muggs and your less -than-industrial sized machine. Didnt pick up from description clues that it was OS.
5,Works Great,Purchased it to go with 50 oz. frothing pitcher. The clip that holds the thermometer to the pitcher works well and the temperature reading is accurate.
4,A bit long,"Love this thermometer. I use it for making lattes, getting milk the right temperature for yogurt, to testing meat for proper internal temps. However pay attention to the length of this thermometer. It's quite long and can be awkward at times trying to keep it in the right place, as it often hits the bottom of the container making it hard to keep clipped in the desired place."
3,Scratched,The thermometer had a scratch on the glass. It is acurate regarding temperature though so still usable. I love the clip it came with to hook to the frother cup.
5,Flicker bulbs,This product was exacty as shown and came when they stated it would. I would reccommend this product to my friends and family.
3,"Low Wattage, Low Light",Nice low wattage bulb. Inside flame color is black when not in use; has orange flicker light when on. It does not put out much light. It's useful for decorative purposes only.
5,O'Rourke's Revenge is a fast-paced western novel.,"Larry Martin does a great job of bringing the Old West alive with his latest fast-paced novel O'Rourke's Revenge. It is a real page-turner that you won't want to put down until the end. Ryan O'Rourke keeps getting deeper and deeper into trouble with seemingly no way out. Larry Martin has done a great job of researching the setting of his story and does an excellent job of character development. For a good Old West yarn, read O'Rourke's Revenge."
3,"""Feed Me"" makes this worth the investment.","Third single from ""Hey Babe"", ""I See You"" is valuable to Juliana Hatfield fans for its collection of b-sides-- indeed all three of the cuts on here would have served ""Hey Babe"" well.""Feed Me"", a delicate acoustic guitar-and-vocal number about anorexia, where Hatfield's girlish vocal goes far to nicely express the anguish of a girl trying so hard to be loved, was likely left off ""Hey Babe"" because of its similar mood to ""Ugly"" (also included here). Both, however, are superb pieces and well worth a listen.Admittedly, neither ""Here Comes the Pain"" (a decent mid-tempo piece) nor the explosive groupie attack ""Rider"" are really all that intriguing, but both are as good as the title track of this single and several of the pieces on ""Hey Babe"".But regardless, ""Feed Me"" alone is worth taking the time to dig up this single."
3,I see her.,"This 5 track EP is pretty good. The first two songs are on her ""Hey Babe"" album, so if you have that, this might not be so essential. Of course fanatics might need this. All 5 tracks sound as good as she looks."
3,"Great Paint, Bad Parts","I think that this Mercedes SL55 AMG is a really good replica of the real thing. The paint is very realistic, and the wheels by major companies are really cool. The only thing that I'm concerned about is the quality and value of this toy. I think that the quality is downright low, put into consideration that the cost for one of these cars is three to four dollars. When you play with these cars, the wheels move up and down, and it feels like you are moving it over a gravel road. The tires slip off very easily, and usually fall off if not put on right away. I also am uncomfortable with the ""safety"" of the car. When you drive the PLAYERZ cars [on a hardwood floor] the windows rattle. It sounds like the HUGE surround sound system implanted in the trunk. Overall, this toy is really well made, but there are flaws in the wheels and paint."
3,Hard to find Shooter,Fun little shooter with a speculative future theme. When it came out it didn't seem to get much media attention. It has since become hard to find in brick and mortar stores.
3,Horrible game,"the game is horrible because you cant talk online and the weapon-aming system is also horrible, you cant zoom in realisticly, instead, a circle with a reticule just pops out...story line is boring"
4,"Rather fun single-player, but online is where it's at!","Just a quick review of the game. The single-player is fun and enjoyable, but (other than the great political/economic story) is somewhat forgettable. However, on the 360, there are some fun achievements to make you re-play levels (speed runs, completing without dying, etc), which are really fun. However, it would have been much better with some co-op.Online is another world, however -- great to play, lots of fun, definitely worth the purchase. Every map is unique and needs a very different strategy. Some are very wide-open with flat turrain, offering lots of opportunities for vehicles to be vital. Others are rugged and mountainous, making foot soldiers the way to go. Each class has strengths and weaknesses making them vital to winning, but not overpowering them. Besides your class, you can pick a ""kit"" that allows for other abilities (calling in airstrikes, etc) to add to the variety.Definitely a recommended game."
2,"Nice Idea, Bad Delivery","When I played the demo for this game, i thought it looked awesome. The graphics where good, i like the idea of the drones, and i thought the story looked pretty complex. But once i bought the game and started playing it, i quickly became bored. Every mission all you do is capture enemy positions and blow up artillery pieces and you don't have any variety of weapons and vehicles. Not to mention the story, which is that the US and England is fighting Russia and China over the remaining oil wells, has only two characters and is very slow. And to add to that the controls suck. It would be a huge waste of money if you buy this game. And don't forget that the game is short."
3,Starts out quite fun... faded fairly quickly,"The short story:This is, generally speaking, a fairly fun game. It didn't really break new ground for me, though, and there are so many shooters with online capabilities already out there. The fact that they added quite a few options as far as vehicles and weapons did give it an edge up on some other online shooters but after about a month it kind of wore out for me. I've heard this from some others as well.I'm not sure I can put my finger on exactly why the fun factor faded but part of it might be the maps. At first I liked how open some of them were and then later I started feeling like they were TOO open.My opinion... rent it and really get into the online play before buying it."
4,Frontlines is first rate.,"I enjoyed all the gadgets the game had. The remotes were fantastic.It took a little over 8 hrs to finish this game on hard. which is about a little short but the used price made it AOK.I enjoyed the ammo caches. I've used the unending stream of replenishing, especially the grenades in my attacks. The automatic weapon lock-on is a welcomed game aid. Looking forward to more games like this.The reviews were a little helpful, especially the lower starred versions. It made me wait until the game price dropped. Buying used is the best way to get anything, especially when retail is unaffordable."
3,"good, but...","the game is good but too short.its like when the fun kicks in just BOOM!! in ur face,its over.the game condition also wasn't how described by the retailer.was in a mess for a second hand game with cracks to the center of the disc and cut up plastic. putting it back and forth in the case would get it worse so i put it in a spindle.otherwise game is ok."
4,Good Military shooter,This is a battlefield / war shooter that is pretty open & gives the player freedom to go their own routes. You have options to use gadgets to clear the area of enemies & tanks. Things like RC Cars & Planes to keep you from harms way but getting into the defense & doing work.It also has a great replay option. You can replay any objective after you beat the game. Not going through the entire level but a certain portionNot very long . Took me about 2 days to beat it but it has some good replay value. Some games after you put 10 hours into beating it your done for a long time. This game is short but sweet. So you can pop it in anytime.
3,"Entertaining, easy, short...","This game was kind of short for my liking. It was fun to a point, but after a while all the levels feel exactly the same, with just a little variation in mapping. I played through all of the levels, and thought it was a very short storyline. If you play straight through, you could probably beat it in a day, and that's with ample breaks for the necessities. Online play was a cool idea, but I wasn't a real fan of how they did it. I kind of saw it as a mix between COD, and Halo/GoW online. It was a realistic military base (COD), but the HUD, and gameplay was alot like Halo or Gears of War. The online maps are bigger than anything on the market up to this point, but it's not really a good thing, because the game isn't very popular, so there's TOO much space for not enough players... It's an ok game to easily rack up gamerscore acheivement points (xbox360), and then trade or sell it. Not a keeper...."
2,not worth it at anyprice,"The game had some potential but was defeated by poor graphics, silly gameplay, difficult vehicle controls and an enemy that can make headshots while running at a mile away. Spend your money on better discount games."
1,Why are people giving this 5 stars?,"This game is horrible, and I can't believe that people are actually giving it 5 stars. Do not listen to them! This is on top of my list of WORST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED. Controls are horrible, gameplay is bad, the AI will only shoot on you and not focus on any of your team-mates, and on easy mode, you die within 10 seconds after going onto the battlefield. It is just a horrible game, people giving the game 5 stars were probably payed to say that stuff. Worst $10 I ever spent!"
5,"One BAAAD Enforcer, One Tough Female Cop!!","This has to be my favorite of the series so far! ""Laws of the Blood: Companions"" is a great read! Selena Crawford is a Chicago Homicide Detective, she is also a non-magical member of a gypse family, she also happens to be the personal property of the head Enforcer in the USA. ""Steve"" and Selena rub each other the wrong way...well maybe its the right way all the time, when their not fighting of course.Vampire Politics mingled with the possibility of an extreamly rare pregnacy make for a wonderfully twisted and exciting read! It is Definately Worth reading this book and this series!..."
5,Ms. Sizemore: Keep em coming,I have alot of books and some I keep and some I eventually pass along..this is on my keep always shelf in my bookcase!!!Ms Sizemore writes well and has strong characters. I feel the storyline and dialogue flows really well too!!I highly recommend this to any that like modern vampire tales!!
4,Part Vamp part cop/detective story...all good.,"I like these books of Ms. Sizemore's. I say like and not love because of all the convoluted politics going on that I don't understand. Maybe she will shed more light on it in futher books, I certainly hope so. Don't let that stop you from enjoying these as they are a fastpaced, delicious read. I've read all 4 so far and will buy the 5th as soon as it is available"
5,The best in the series by far,"I would have to agree, this is a fantastic book. It made you dive right in and wanting more. I especially love the way one book bonds us (the reader) to the next.This book gave me what I wanted most, to know more about Istvan.And I love the way she built his character throughout the series.He is no longer one dimensional, But this reader wants more. And more Istvan too.I hope this isn't it for the series. I definetly saw this writers growth come to maturity on these pages.I put her in a class with my most favorite writers to date.Read it! I promise you won't regret it.Especially those in the ""kindred"" genre."
1,Disappointing,"With all the great reviews on this book, I was expecting something as good as the Anita Blake series. But what a disappointment. The whole thing just fizzled out in the first few pages. The vampires aren't in the least bit menacing and in no did I feel that they were living up to the reputation that a vampire was supposed to have. Won't recommend it."
2,Average,"Not good, but not bad. The plot was VERY predictable as soon as the cast of characters was introduced. If you've read one romance novel, you've read them all- male & female protagonists dislike each other, but fall in love (""soul mates""), etc., etc. The book is not particularly coherent, but seems to be some sort of mishmash of somewhat conflicting ideas.I wish the library had had a copy so I didn't have to buy it. I won't buy any more in the series."
1,THE WORST!!!!!,This is perhaps THE WORST CD I have EVER heard in my life! Hatfield is horrible on vocals (and I have one of her solo albums that she is much better on). (...)
5,A gem! great overview of Bible in conversational style,"A great overview of the entire Old and New Testament, touching on most important books/topics and how it all points to the sacrificial Lamb, Jesus! It as if she is talking to you in her living room, which is actually her gifting along with her famous husband Francis Shaeffer (you may have heard of L'Abri in Switzerland).. Emphasizes the Jewish roots of Christianity. Highly recommended!"
4,A Reminder of My Roots,"Edith Schaeffer (the wife of L'Abri founder, Francis Schaeffer) presents the Gospel to a Jewish audience in the text of this fascinating work. The writer here lays out what many Christians would do well to recognize as the history of their belief and the root of their Christian religion. The book is an easy read full of biblical stories and accounts. The book is laid out as the story of redemption tailored with a keen eye to the Jewish reader."
1,"Christianity is Christian , Judaism is Jewish","Christianity does have its roots in Judaism. But it is a faith distinct from Judaism especially in its teaching of a doctrine of salvation built around Jesus.Judaism does not believe in worshipping any single human being no matter how great.This book is unfair and dishonest, an effort to move Jews to convert to Christianity.I think it is enough for Christianity to be Christian. It doesn't have to be Jewish also . Judaism is for Jews and Christianity for Christians."
2,Not much new here,"This book summarizes the Noble Lost Cause version of the Civil War (or perhaps I should say ""War of Northern Aggression""). It's perhaps significant that all the jacket blurbs are from teachers at southern colleges or right-wing columnists (or both). The war was all the fault of the North, and the South can do no wrong... all the atrocity stories are trotted out (there are five pages on the burning of Columbia, but you won't find any mention of the burning of Chambersburg or Lawrence by Confederates). Writers who disagree with his views are tarred with the brush of ""leftism"". The title seems to imply that we'll hear new revelations about Lincoln's iniquity, but the book's just a summary of secondary source material. On the plus side, it's clearly written and a good place to go to find a presentation of the extreme pro-Southern view of the war. But read something a bit more balanced, too (McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom is a good place to start)."
1,How wrong can an author be????,"Robert Toombs the Southern fire-eater to Jefferson Davis on the eve of Ft Sumpter:""The firing on that fort will inaugurate a civil war greater than any the world has yet seen. It is suicide, murder and you will lose us every friend in the North. You will wantonly strike a hornets nest which extends from mountains to ocean. Legions now quiet will swarm out and sting us to death. It is unnecessary. It puts US in the wrong. It is fatal"".But he fired anyway--so who started the Civil War??? Not Lincoln. Remember in his inaugural he said to the South:""In your hands my dissatisfied countrymen and not mine is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will NOT assail you. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the agressors""Sound like a tyrant and a warmonger?? Not to me!!!"
1,A realists view of the real Lincoln,"It is an interesting book, but the author exhausts his thesis in the first 32 pages. It would make an interesting pamphelet of 30 or 40 pages. I am sure the tome is factual and will be loved by all people from the southern states. As a history buff I find it interesting."
5,Lincoln Myth Shattered,"Factual, scholarly, shatters the myth of the saintly Lincoln who united a nation and freed the slaves. Book exposes the fact that Lincoln was formost a politician and that his ambitions were responsible for the destruction of half the nation. Proves his greatest interest is blacks was that they be expelled from America."
1,Unbelievably Bad,"Easily the most incompetent work of non-fiction I've ever read. The author, Dilorenzo, is not a historian. He is an economist by training and a Libertarian gadfly. And it shows: The perposterous thesis is ""supported"" if that's the word by inaccurate quotes, quotes taken out of context, and sometimes quotes the author attributes to Lincoln that were actually made by people with whom Lincoln disagreed."
1,This book is hard to swallow.,I have read this book with a history teachers point of view. I find this more of a right wing politically driven book than a true picture of the events and the life and decisions of President Lincoln. This is changing history to fit states rights ideals. I have an open mind. I have studied the history of the USA for 40+ years and I find this book to be interesting in its portrayment of Abraham Lincoln but I give it no creditability.
4,The Real Lincoln - A Nation Fooled for 100 Years,"This book is well documented and would have to be to support the position that is presented.It all makes sense. The history is very sad. If the populace was more interested in the facts, the truth might take hold. However, I'm not holding my breath.Do read this book."
5,Excellent Analysis,"This book not only gives a detailed account of the political motivations that prompted Lincoln to make war--not only on the people of the South, but also on the Constitution he was sworn to uphold--but also gives truly insightful economic analysis that is left behind in most books concerning the War for Southern Independence.DiLorenzo does an excellent job of laying the historical framework for the type of central state that Lincoln wanted to (and ultimately did) bring into place in the United States, shredding permanently the government set into place originally by the founding fathers.Those who have been taught to believe that Lincoln was a ""good president"" are in for a rude awakening, as DiLorenzo, through excellent research, exposes this view as the myth it truly is. Anyone who reads this book with an open mind will come away enlightened by the experience.I believe this book should be required reading in US history classes."
5,Let the truth be told,"I never bought into the notion that Lincoln was the greatest president when I was in high school long ago, unless the standard of measure of presidential greatness is who got the most Americans killed in an unconstitutional and unnecessary war.The Real Lincoln is revisionist history as it should be, exposing the buried truth instead of repeating the establishment myths. Well researched and a great read."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"In ""The Real Lincoln"", Mr. DiLorenzo blatantly rewrites history, showing a complete disregarding for the facts. Anybody who has even a high school level understanding of the Civil War should be able to pick out the constant historical inaccuracies that fill Mr. DiLorenzo's book. In short, don't waste your time with this garbage."
3,book,"This is an interesting perspective as is the title, the book reflects the author's choice of title: ""The Real Lincoln."""
1,history on its head!,first look at sequence........the arrogance of the south in insisting on their imperative right to expand slavery into new areas of the western u.s.............linked to their refusal to accept a constitutional amendment forever safeguarding slavery in the existing southern states.......gives lye to the fundamental premise of this book....don't let it insult your intelligence!
1,Can we have less than one star?,"So Thomas Dilorenzo writes that BAD Abe Lincoln was the cause of the Civil War, oops, I mean the War Against the Invading North. Only one problem here, the secession started BEFORE Lincoln was in office. But facts never stood in the way of the ""Lost Cause"" folks, a.k.a. flat earthers. By the way Dilorenzo, why didn't the south negotiate a peaceful means to remain in the United States (that's right it was then and still is now the United States thanks to Pres. Lincoln)?What really galls me is how many of these flat earthers are the same ones who tell others that if they don't like this country, then they should leave! There are so many people wishing they had a country like America, and here we have so many wishing that their ancestors had taken them out of the U.S.Well, I proudly fly my flag and last I checked, the U.S. has a free exit door, so God Bless America Mr. Dilorenzo and don't let the door hit you on the way out."
1,Fit for the fireplace,I am in shock that this piece of filth could find a publisher to get this into circulation. Don't come to my town talking that trash.
1,A Whole Lot of Clap-Trap,"This is simply a bit of revisionist history that is at odds with Lincoln's written record. If one reads Lincoln's own writings one easily sees through the overt agenda of Dilorenzo; one that should be denounced for the pitiful piece of clap-trap masquerading as research.There are too many records of the handwringing Lincoln went through over comitting to war and his committment to emancipation. Coupled with my own reading of Lincoln's writing, I cannot agree with this fantasy. It should be put in the fiction bin.This book has earned a place in my firewood bin."
1,the real lincoln - NOT,"I could ramble on why the book is taking Lincoln out of text, but it is best you read a book that tells you what DiLorenzo leaves out of his books. He cherry picks. If your ignorant about Lincoln you will fall for this book. The Kansas-Nebraska act is very important. So is Lincoln's reply to the Dred Scott case. Neither one are mentioned in these books more than one or two lines. If you knew the truth about what Lincoln stated on just these two subjects, you would know DiLorenzo takes Lincoln out of context or doesn't mention things that make him look good. Carl Sandburg made more out of Lincoln than he was - Almost as if he was a god. Lincoln was no god. We do need books that tell both sides. This book only tells the bad side of Lincoln, but he is taken out of context. Don't believe me, read the book that refutes this - Lincoln Vindicated."
3,"An accurate portrayal of the Lincoln Administration, but....","rather wordy. In fact I have never seen the word ""myriad"" used so much, but I digress. He clearly could have made his point in half the time, but many who write scholarly works believe that the longer the piece the better.The information contained within is common knowledge for those who have studied the time period. Lincoln did nothing, for example, to stop Sherman's ""March to the Sea,"" and all of the horrible crimes which were committed.The book, I think, would be an eye-opener for those who believe that Lincoln was some kind of great savior as my public school teachers would have had me believe. He was, no doubt, a tyrant who gave the military the green light to do whatever it wanted and who would not allow anyone to stand in his way."
1,Revanchism at its finest.,"Yet another ""devastating"" attack from an unabashedly liberal revanchist historian. Evidently there is nothing quite sacred in this country, least of all the notion that any of our presidents - particularly the best ones - could actually have any true merit at all."
4,A Politician is a Politician,"A ""laughable screed""? Why? Because it truthfully dims the incandescence of the hagiography? To the old maxim that the victors write the subsequent history, I will add this: Beware ANY pedestal that is:1) Erected in the District of Corruption 2) Supported by the biography that is written by ANY author whose name ends in -berg 3 Is/was erected on the ashes of Jeffersonian freedom. And, no, nice try, I am NOT anti-semite. Arabs are NOT Khazars!Lincoln Unmasked: What You're Not Supposed to Know About Dishonest Abe"
2,Less a Thesis Than a Lawyer's Brief,"Dilorenzo has so many axes to grind he should take up railsplitting. As history the book is a joke: anyone who wants to learn about the real Lincoln should read David Donald's biography. For southern apologists (who can't abide the thought that the CSA was created to protect slavery) and fans of ""man bites dog"" wacko theories, though, it's not bad."
5,Everyone should read this !!!,"Our educational system teaches us that Lincoln was a god. This book shows us that he was a tyrant. Educate yourself, take a look behind the curtain!"
1,stay away from this author,"This author, Thomas J. DiLorenzo is a pseudo-intellectual. Check him out on Youtube. I have heard him lecture. Unfortunately, his goal is not to explore Lincoln in an objective way, but rather to justify Southern secession during the Civil War, and to support extremist, anti-fed Libertarianism. Do a few searches online to see that he is not a credible scholar. He traffics his ideas mainly to extremist groups in the South. Visit the wikipedia sources at the bottom of his entry. Don't trust me, Google this man. But above all, don't buy his book. Read it from the library, if you must. Lincoln is a great president; complex, conflicted, but worthy of serious study."
1,Utter Garbage,"You could be perfect and someone would come out with a book that totally trashes you and would be based on opinion, questionable sources,and speculation.Plain and simple, this is trash--don't waste your money on it."
1,"to call this ""history"" is egregiously fallacious","Historiographically this work is, at best, claptrap. Work of this quality would fail even an introductory course in history at any reputable university.It can be described most kindly as a badly researched polemic. Its aspiration to be considered scholarly is daft egoism."
1,"Agitprop, not fact","The book is a revisionist history told from the point of view of a 21st Century Republican, the Party that is unlike anything that Lincoln envisioned (or, for that fact in an different way, Reagan). Let's not forget the Fox news debacle with Rove. The Etch-a-Sketch ""reality"" of candidate Romney. DiLorenzo's work here is in the same ugly spirit: agitprop, not fact."
5,WOW!,"""The victors get to write the history""...I knew that what I was taught during my education years(1957-1975) was dominated by the liberal progressive viewpoint. Somehow I had swallowed all I had been taught about Lincoln as totally true, without questionong (something my Dad had taught me not to ever do!). I never connected that the larger than life image of Lincoln, promulgated by the progressive historians was because of the fact that Lincoln would be the progressives' model president. He centralized governmental power in the executive branch not letting that ""pesky"" little US Constitution get in the way. Our country began the slide toward big government at that point. This book really opened my eyes! I highly recommend it!"
4,Sometimes reality hurts,"Growing up, Lincoln was my favorite president. This book isn't the first information I've come across in the last few years that have changed my attitude toward Mr. Lincoln. He was a remarkable man, no doubt, but thanks to him we have a federal government that can overpower states and individuals for the sake of ""The Union"". This is not what our Founding Fathers intended. The Civil War really started over state's rights. Today we see the same argument rearing its head over the health care bill with several states challenging the legality of the federal government again dictating policy to states who would rather decide for themselves. A good read."
1,The Unfinished Civil War?,"Southern people need to get it in their heads that the Civil War is over! It ended nearly 140 years ago! Yet we see people that write this kind of stuff that think it is still going on. It is not right to make one of the greatest Americans look like an evil person, but who really only wanted nothing but peace. His heart might have been in the wrong place, but he did NOT start the American Civil War. He raised 75,000 troops at the beginning, but none of that would have been needed if the Confederates had not fired on Fort Sumter in the first place! Don't read this book. Don't read a story of what someone wished had happened! Get a real piece of history and expand your brain. The south will NOT rise again! Get it into your head!"
1,Hogwash,"Another iconoclastic effort to reduce an honored man to the lowest common denominator. President Lincoln reportedly told a White House guest, ""If I were to read, much less answer, all the attacks made on me, this shop might as well be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know how --the very best I can; and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what is said against me won't amount to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, 10 angels swearing I was right would make no difference."""
1,This book is a piece of crap,"Anyone taking just a little time to read a few of the Lincoln biographies or histories that are available will quickly see what a wonderful, genuinely humane man Lincoln was--- and why he is rated our finest president. This book is a rant with a political agenda --- save your money. Read Shelby Foote's Civil War 3 volumes instead........."
1,Full of errors,"This book was a disappointment. I didn't expect toagree with the author's viewpoint, but I didn't expectto find so many obvious errors of fact. Mr. DiLorenzoclearly does not have the historical background to havewritten this book, and his political agenda obviously iswhat is driving his thesis."
1,An axe to grind,This author definately has an axe to grind. Any honest reader would do well to look at the history and leave this book alone.
2,not much better,"The recent trend of herocide, or the slaying of mythical heros of history, seems to me rather trite. The historians that barge onto the scene, denouncing grade school heros as tyrants, scoundrels or infidels are no better than the lauditory historians that heap praise on national figures. The answer here is not to find some ultimate condemnation or deification of historical figures, but to understand them within the context of their time and understand their actions and motives. I blame much of the poor response to biographies on this. Without this effort to explain actions, the point of biographies is to me, entirely unclear. Unless we understand historical figures, how can we possibly condemn or laud them. It behooves us much to neglect those writings that seek a good/bad dichotomy, and instead focus our attention on writings that face the humanity of historical figures. Mr. Dilorenzo would do well to drop his agenda and try and explain Lincoln, not demonize him."
1,New Heights in Conspiracy Theory,"Despite its hype, this book adds nothing to the historiography of Abraham Lincoln or the Civil War. Numerous other negative reviews detail the text's numerous technical inaccuracies, and there is no point covering that ground again. I find it difficult to call this work a history. It contains no new information of consequence, and reflects no meaningful original research. Its conclusions are based on assumptions that are in many cases fallacious, and it advances its ""interpretation"" by setting up absurd ""straw man"" cases and then ""proving"" its point by knocking them down. In consequence, it offers no genuine insight into the period. This work is more in the nature of a neo-conservative rant about ""big government"" masquerading as a ""study"" of the civil war era, written to advance an agenda rather than historical understanding."
1,The Real Bad Book,"I was really looking forward to this book. I read it about two years ago or so. And then shared it with my son who is now in his second year as a History/Education major. I did this because I wanted to get his 'second opinion'.We agreed--this book is devastatingly BAD. Chapter after chapter the author is in attack mode like the shower scene from psycho. I was hoping this would be a good read, with some critical insight into Lincoln and his decision making and leadership---since no one is perfect. But this book became tiresome to read with 'waterfall of nonsense' attacking Lincoln every step---I was shocked it was an academic that wrote it.I see that the author wrote a second one to this--I browsed it at Borders--it looked like a rehash"
1,Lies fabrication and tomfoolery,"The base argument ehre is that a peaceful settlement to the civil war was possible. Which peaceful settlement would that hve been? The peaceful settlement when the COnfederates fired on Ft. Sumner or was it the peaceful settlement that would have allowed Slavery to exist? Was it the peaceful settlement that would allow states to suceed from the union any time they wanted? This books argument is wrong and the idea is nonsense. Any true student of the Civil war knows that the war, once Lincoln was elected, was inevitable. Regardless if you support the South or think the war was a catastrophe(it was) it doesn't mean you can just re-write history and decide it didn't need to happen. This book is almost as realistic as claiming that America didn't need to enter WWII.Seth J. Frantzman"
1,Absolute Garbage.,"Throughout this book, DiLorenzo purposefully misleads the reader by misquoting Lincoln and other sources, completely neglecting context, and leaving out vital information to understanding the truth. DiLorenzo has one objective in this book: convincing the reader that Lincoln is pure evil. He doesn't care what he has to say, he doesn't care if he prints the truth; all he cares about is that the reader agrees with him.Anyone with a basic understanding of the Civil War and 19th Century America could riddle the pages with counterpoints disproving virtually EVERY SINGLE point that DiLorenzo makes. I wouldn't exaggerate; Dilorenzo flat-out lies constantly, and if he isn't intentionally lying, he is incredibly misguided on the issues discussed. PLEASE do yourself a favor and avoid this book. If you're being forced to read this for a class, I beg that you question his points and think critically about the topics because this book is full of extreme propaganda. It is awful."
1,Not a Real Biography,"I agree with the last two reviewers. The ""facts"" can be molded or shaped to fit any agenda. This is clearly what has happened here. Revisionist history at its worst. Avoid at all costs."
4,Too Short,"Judging from the howls of the orthodox, Mr. Dilorenzo has hit a nerve. My only complaint is that the ""The Real Lincoln"" is too short. Volumes await to be written on the subjects raised herein.If you want to explore the genesis of the bloated, centralized, unconstitutional federal apparatus under which Americans labor today, read this book."
5,An odd and honest book,"The author takes an exceptionally close look at all aspects of a nun's life, from her sexuality to her work to her psyche. As a child, and even now, I've been fascinated by women who would literally give up their lives to prayer. The author traces the changes that nuns have gone through, such as changing their cloistered nature and their covered habits. The only problem for me was that I did not leave this book with any better understanding of the choices women make to become nuns....I had a better idea, but not a complete understanding. The book is really well written. One would think a book about nuns might be horribly boring, but in fact, I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book to anyone who finds nuns as mysterious as I do."
2,Avoid this.,"Yuri Temirkanov is one of the most controversial russian conductors. His performances are unpredictable,so you can love some of his readings when he is ""in the mood"" and hate the rest. His Tchaikovsky is oftenbizarre, mannered and even perverse. This album is an excellent sample of these statements. They areweird and underplayed performances, with absurd rubatos that ruin the score and make the music sound uglyand affected. This is not Tchaikovsky, for my taste. Avoid this album."
3,Good quiet motor was not a direct replacement,"Although I had the original motor and ordered and received a direct replacement, The shaft was not correct. The original motor had the same shaft diameter but had a larger diameter step to seat the fan cage off of the motor face. When I installed my cage it bottomed on the bearing seal area locking it up. I was able to create a spacer that rested on the bearing but cleared the end frame to replicate the original. If you do not have access to a small metal lathe, you may not find this usable. Once modified, the motor is quiet and the rest of the mounting and wiring were correct for my application."
3,This is NOT the best Rach 3 ever.,"This is a fine version of Rachmaninov's 3rd Piano Concerto. But it is not the best. The greatest is Horowitz in 1951. He also did it again in 1978 and it was fabulous. Martha Augerich's recording should also be looked at here.Again, this is a fine CD. But not the best Rach 3. Save yourself some cash and get the aformentioned recordings."
4,Essential for Chile,"This is the best thing going for Chile. Plus, Alvaro is a nice guy. Wish I'd got a hardbound edition, but the paperback is a good value. Informative maps, good plates. No complaints."
4,Cool fan for a great price,"We really liked this purchase it has solved our purpose of buying a fan. Apart from that it is very light and handy for us to move from room to room as we want it. Remote comes in handy. Nice buy, I would recommend."
3,The Aloha is Noisy,"I was expecting the (White) Aloha Tower Fan instead I received a different model (Grey). It is has a droning noise, not a steady noise. That makes it difficult for me to sleep with it on. I am not pleased with it but did not want to go through the trouble of sending it back. The model I received is different from the one that was shown online."
1,"Buy the Lasko, much better product.","This fan was delivered with not all the pieces in the package. No way to keep it from leaning to the side. I have 2 other tower fans with remote, they are Lasko and are a far superior product. Also, packaging on the delivered box said it could be returned to the store, and we have Target in this area, so I took it to the store. They had no clue how to return it, were not interested in helping, and so my rating for customer service is 0. Amazon always makes return easy....Target EH!"
1,Doesn't work,waste of money. It came with no screws. We tried to get the required size but they weren't carried by the local hardwares..including Home Depot and Lowes. Called and they did send the screws..but they don't fit correctly so the fan doesn't stand upright. Absolutely worthless to us. If we still had the box we would send it back.
4,works well,"i set one of these in front of my window air conditioning unit to push the air down a long narrow living room/dining room area. it's easy to move around, but since it takes up so little room, i'm going to buy a couple of more so i don't have to unplug this one all the time to move it.it gets 4 stars from me because of the noise. it's not very very noisy, but the sound makes it impossible to use the variable speed setting because the sound pitch changes."
5,Very happy customer here,"Great price, fast delivery, no problems. Been looking locally for this fan for 2 years, finally found it here. Far better quality, better air volume, and better controls, and priced at half of what the local retailers want for an inferior product!!!! I bought 2 new ones. I had my first one for about 6 years, used it 24/7....."
4,Works awesome,"This fan works awesome. Remote control works well for me, due to my disability. Buttons are easy to press. Puts out a good ammount of air, very quiet and I love the timer so it goes off in the middle of the night. I am not sure what ""night mode"" or ""natural wind mode"" are, seem the same to me. I wish the manual would explain that. You do have to put this fan together!! I have someone do it for me, which took about 10 minutes or less. It took so long because some of the plastic pieces would not stay in place at first. Overall, this is an awesome buy and well worth the $40."
1,BBB rating of Aloha corporation is F (the worst possible),"Check out BBB of Fort Worth, TX. Aloha is located in Arlington, TX. 76011; the phone number is 800-295-4448.; the BBB search can be done using the phone number; the zip code will send you to BBB of Fort Worth.The company has no website, and it does not provide the names of the owners, and other details. The company may be almost bankrupt; apparently, more than 200,000 heaters (some of them started fires) were recalled. Walmart used to sell Aloha ceiling fans and heaters but stopped doing so, possibly or probably because of the quality problems."
2,No!!!!,"I'm so sad, I have to have a fan on in my bedroom at night in order to sleep, but this fan (even on the low setting) has woken me up at 3am two nights in a row now- and there I find myself, sitting up in bed half-asleep wondering where those loud sirens could be coming from. Then I realize that the sound is my new fan. The first night I went back to sleep, but the second night I got up and turned it off. I think I'm going to have to return it. Oh, and while it was pretty easy to assemble, we had to translate the directions a bit, since they were printed in China, by people who don't speak English very well."
4,Good Perspective,"This helped to bring about a balanced perspective regarding the relationship with my fifteen year old daughter. Its easy to read and made me laugh out loud. It is like he was in my living room watching my daughter and I butt heads. It gave me hope and a plan of action. It also helped me realize that there are many parents that are going through the same situations with their teenagers and I truly am not ""the enemy""."
5,I survived my daughter's early teenage years with this book!,"The parenting issues this book explores are right on target! After reading this book and applying some of the practices and attitudes Mr. Wolf advises, I was able to return to a happy and calm life in my own home (without getting rid of the teenager!). I have bought four copies now to share with other parents that are lamenting the teenage years in their home! A MUST READ."
5,HOW MUCH WOULD YOU SPEND FOR PEACE? Buy this book!,"I didn't believe the hype about this book, but after following some of the suggestions offered within, I see that it wasn't hype at all...it was duly deserved praise for sound advice. I have a really good kid who can be dramatic and a bit of a slug. Thanks to Wolf, we have had a fight-free week, and my kid is pretty much doing what she is asked without me having to ask her more than twice. Wolf's insights into how the teenaged mind works are enlightening and dead on. The book has given me some peace of mind, too, about what kind of an adult she will become, and that is invaluable. Just get this book...for the price of a pizza, it could buy you a lot of peace!"
4,Oh Cheryl!,"I first read this when my oldest daughter was a teen; we even called her alter ego Cheryl. It has since been updated. I now have another teen daughter and needed a refresher. Dr. Wolf does an excellent job of describing what she is going through. The update was helpful. While I agree with his assessment of the situation I am not sure I agree with some of his solutions. I prefer Dr. Kevin Lehman's solutions to teen behavior. I recommend this book to parents so they realize that they are not insane nor are they alone. Also there is hope. ""Cheryl"" is now happily married with a family."
4,Surviving a teenage daughter,"This book was bought as a gift for my daughter. My 15 year old granddaughter is sometimes quite the challenge. Hopefully, this will enlighten my daughter in how todays teenager thinks/acts and provide some guidance to the parent in surviving the next 3 to 5 years."
5,FABULOUS book!!!,"I bought my first copy of this book when my children were preteens. I also bought copies for all my friends for Christmas gifts that year. I read it in one sitting and LOVED it. It explains everything that happens as your child goes from childhood to 'tween and it does it in a hilarious way. It also explains why they do what they do and why it has to happen for them to move into adulthood.My children are now 33, 31, and 29 and I continue to buy copies for friends who have young children. I also have recommended it to all my middle school student's parents. This book is PRICELESS!"
4,Still Relevant 8 Years After Update and Worth Your Busy Time,"Recommended reading for parents of teens and tweens. Most parents will discover the arguments they have with their teens are typical and the author gives suggestions on what works and what won't work. A lot of it is common sense advice, but at least you know for sure what things to keep on doing and what things will be a waste of time.The witty writing makes this a breezy read that only helps you better absorb and understand the content. Wolf shares dialogue that many parents will wonder if he was a fly on their wall. Beware that there are bad words in the book, which reflect the typical teen's language and have every purpose of being there.This isn't your typical parenting book full of studies and directives like the ones you read when your child was newborn or toddler. Although last updated in 2002 (eight years ago from when I read it), the book's contents still remain relevant today."
4,Get Out of My Life review,"I really enjoyed this book and it helped me to see my teenagers in a brand new light. It's filled with stories and insights that made me laugh because I'd been through similar experiences, and it helped me to understand that what my teenagers are going through is ""normal and healthy,"" which helped lift my self-imposed guilt burden of being a less than effective parent. My only criticsm would be that the author has chosen to use foul language in many of his teenage dialogue examples. By his own admission early in the book, examples of teenage dialogue included are not actual quotes from teens but his own made up examples based on his experience in counseling. I know he chose to use the offensive language in order to ""keep it real"" because many teens do use those words. But I think he could have conveyed the same message without using these words directly. In spite of that, I still recommend the book, but reader beware if you are offended by ""F bombs."""
2,filthy,I was shocked by the condition of this used book. There was coffe stains on the pages. The cover literally had food or something stuck to it. I had to use cleaning products on it to wipe off the crap on the cover and back. The book itself is wonderful but I think the sender must live in a garbage house. I was a bit afraid to use the book not know what other germs could be on it.
4,Good advise and insight.,"The CD's were easy to listen to and make alot of sense. I look forward to the time when my children outgrow this stage, but the insights given by the author and practical ways of communicating with teenage daughters has been helpful in cutting back on the stress in our home."
4,"Very Helpful, but Extremely Offensive Language","I found this book very helpful in putting the trials and tribulations of raising teens in perspective. I now view my son's new independence with pride and understanding rather than sadness and concern. I also feel better prepared for handling future issues in a supportive and mature way.The only problem I had with this book was its extremely offensive language. I ""get it"" that Wolfe was trying to present an honest representation of teenagers. But I think he's off target. If any teenager I know spoke to an adult in the nasty and disrespectful way that he presents as ""normal"", they would be in DEEP trouble - it simply is not tolerated. I find it hard to believe that any teen is allowed to speak to parents using the ""F"" word and would rather not have to read it, myself. I almost trashed the book several times due to the repeated use of nasty language and feel the book would have been more effective if cleaned up."
4,Oh don't we all as kids make that wish....,"I read this book a lot as a kid. What kid does not wish to be sick themselves when brother or sister get all the attention.Such a precious little book, and easy to read- any young child will love it. The illustrations by Aliki are interesting too."
5,A CHILDHOOD CLASSIC!,CAN REMEMBER READING THIS BOOK WHEN I WAS A CHILD! IT WAS EXILLENT. MY LIBRARY HAS COPIES BUT KNOW I'M ON THE HUNT FOR MY VERY OWN. IT IS AN EXELLENT BOOK TO READ TO SCHOOL KIDS ABOUT SIBLING RIVELRY AND BEING FRIENDS..I CAN'T WAIT TO READ IT TO MY NIECES AND NEPHEW.
4,easy to follow examples (but the creativity is not included),"a serie of examples with easy and fast results, even if not all for ""dummies"". Do not ask why Photoshop works but just use it!Very clear explanations step by step (but in some case not so easy).Of course top results depend also from your creativity and from your feeling with the mouse (and these two are not included in the book)."
5,I am awed by this book,"I am a beginning digital photographer and I think this book is really helpful. From the beginning, I have had no trouble understanding how to correct my photos. Mr. Kelby makes the digital darkroom enjoyable and easy to uderstand."
5,Scott the Master of Photoshop!,"Just received this incredible book. From the wonderful acknowledgement page I knew this was going to be different. This is what all digital photographer's who use Photoshop have been waiting for. Scott's witty style of pacing you through the steps makes it so easy. Well written, well conceived. Covers all the issues that a digital photographer new or seasoned to the game could ask for. Scott Kelby has the style that makes you go WOW.... that was easy enough. Plenty of tips for the pros. Covers all the best of Photoshop 7 plus the new Adobe's Camera RAW plug-in. From organizing your work to photo touch-up to preparing your work for presentation to special effects this book has it all. Scott Kelby has written so many great books on Photoshop and to me this tops the list. This book will be well worn in no time. Thank you Scott for sharing your knowledge to all of us who enjoy Photoshop."
2,entertaining the beginneers,"I scanned it in the bookstore and I thought it looked like it had something I could use. It does, but there is a lot of things I take issue with.The basic philosophy behind this book is that photoshop, and digital photography, is best mastered by getting ""tips"" and ""tricks"" that will go ""bam!"" like something out of Batman's utility belt. You just have to know what button to press on your digital wizard/photogee-gaw/hookah-and-also-makes-juliened-fries answer device and Presto! It's perfect.Many will find this appealing. And, Scott Kelby has got that appealing juvenile style a la Dave Barry which makes it seem at least like he doesn't take himself too seriously.However, his description of how to ""color-correct any photo - FAST!"" is so misleading I really have to take issue with it.I just wish I hadn't fallen for the glib tone and paid the huge dollars. What was I thinking?"
5,Fantastic book if you understand the purpose of it...,"This book is NOT about ...- how do I scan my pictures in- how do I use photoshop and all the features in it.This book is about...- I have some problems with my digital photos- I need to color correct- I need to sharpen the image- I need to reduce red eye- I need to fix skin tones- etcThe introduction of the book best summarizes his approach...""He does x number of seminars every year for hundreds of professional photographers, they all ask the same questions on how to fix digital photos for the customer."" This book summarizes all the tips and tricks to get the job done.I couldn't be happier with the book, it has exactly what I want in it."
3,Good info for amateur photographers and hobbyists,"This book has some good information in it that would be beneficial to Professional photographers, but most of the techniques are aimed at amateurs and graphic designers, not professional photographers. I'm a professional retoucher and digtal imagin expert, and would not say it's on my ""must have list"". That list would start with Martin Evening's Photoshop for Professional Photographers, and also include the Real World Photoshop and Real World Color Management books."
2,Not groundbreaking,"This book is pretty. ... that's about it ... pretty. It could be much more helpful in the area of color-correction. Many of the image alterations are corny and have more steps involved than you really need to get the job done. Overall, it has a nice title but has nothing surprising in the realm of color correction, use of layers or effects."
3,Old copyright date,I thought I was getting a new copyright so with technology like it is a lot of the book is out of date. That was probably my fault for just reading the condition of the book. The book was in perfect condition although it did take a long time to arrive.
5,Nice practical book,"I have bought a number of photoshop books, and this is one of my favorites. It basically shows you how to do some specific tasks, such as color correction and other retouching techniques. The book takes you step by step through the process. People looking for books more akin to manuals will not like this book. I picked up a number of tips and am still working to incorporate his suggestions."
3,Cute but I'm sure there's better in this price range,"My husband is not happy with this purchase - the chain has fallen off more than once and other parts have come loose. He has to tighten things up on a weekly basis and do repairs during rides. It is very cute, but we've only had it for a short time and are looking to replace it with something more reliable. A new bike shouldn't require so much attention. I don't suggest it."
4,Carolina Cruiser,"I bought this product for my 7 year olds birthday. I am very pleased with its sturdy, strong build and she really likes the look of it and was very excited about it! I would suggest to others to purchase this product for long term use is seems to be very easy to ride and will last for a long time."
4,"Humor, Horror and the Law: A Natural Mix?","Wolff and Byrd are the Scully and Mulder of the legal world. They take the cases no-one wants, that horrify, boggle, and amuse modern society, from the undead (Estate management is so tricky when you come back from the grave) to vampiric Mafioso. Suggested filing location: Humor, horror and the law. Clever artwork and witty satire, not to mention the unusual topic make this graphic novel a standout. Neil Gaiman, who wrote the intro, agrees."
1,Problems with Brunton Eclipse Adventure Racing Compass,"I was disappointed with a few item with the Brunton compass. First, the instruction manual print is way to small.I have to use a magnifying glass to read it. Next,the dial as it is very, very difficult to move. The information for setting the declination ring is definitely not clear in the instructions. I can not get mine to move. I am very sorry that I purchased it and would not recommend it for use. I feel there should be a place that you can go and get specific answers to questions that you have about the product. Very dissatisfied with the compass for the price."
5,"Great Compass, Loaded with Features.","This is a great compass. It has all the bells and whistles. Tool-less declination adjustment, a magnifier for the degree, removable ruler, and UTM scale for working with a map and a GPS. I love the ""circle inside circle"" for lining up the sights. I can't speak to the UTM stuff as I haven't use that feature yet, but everything else is excellent. We used this compass on a hike through a large set of sand dunes. No marked trails. The compass guided us exactly where we wanted to go, despite my skepticism a few times on the direction it was sending us. Everyone hiking should know how to use and bring a compass, even if just a backup in case your GPS fails. This one is a little pricey, but well worth it."
3,"Fast read, little content","This book reads quickly as if it were a sit-com. I know,I know, the book is based on a sit-com, nonetheless, you would expect it to have slightly more actual content than it does. The book would be good a good starting point for young boys who are reluctant readers or for anyone who just wants to quickly get through a book, not have to think while reading and be done with it."
3,The Cottage Physician,"Overall it is an informative book, obviously there are outdated items, but it still gives you the just of what you need to know for the basics. If you are not big on going to the doctor all of the time and what some basic info this is a good book for that."
1,boring,I am learning sign language in school and wanted to learn more from some dvds. My mom got this dvd for me to help me learn more sign language. I do not like watching it because it is just a lady teaching the signs for the songs. I don't think this is a good dvd for kids who want to learn sign language because it is kind of boring.
1,Wait for the next version,"This is a great idea for a product for the Mac, and these guys could own an entire category on the Mac platform without any competitors, but sadly the products quality and design is very poor. It is if they designed the product cheaply knowing there was no competition, vs. making a killer product knowing there was no competition so they could own the segment.Anyway, wait for the next version, assuming it is better. I would not buy this product given it's bugs, poor user experience, slow speed, and general lack of quality"
1,3 thumbs down,"i was a user of MS streets and trips, and belive that it was the one thing MS did correctly and i am shocked to say that not only is the mac competition (RT66) lacking, but simply not worth using. RT66 makers should be ashamed and do not deserve to be among mac and its usual integrity."
3,Question for those who own this software,"I'm looking for a mapping program that allows me to upload a lot of addresses (say, 100) via a comma delimited file (or some other standard format), and then will generate a map w/ stars (or other indicators) for each of the addresses I've entered. Essentially, the software version of having a map on the wall w/ pins in it.I've used Streetfinder on a PC, but I'd prefer to have a Mac-based solution. Does Route USA fulfill this functionality?"
1,Wishing for something useful,This product is terrible. Create a route from Alabama to Colorado and the generated route uses US highways without Interstates. Also in preferences uses gallons/100 miles instead of miles/gallon. Obviously this was not reviewed by any US citizens prior to release. The only plus is the map data is decent so they MIGHT update the executable.
3,Almost there.,"This application is acceptable simply because it's the only option. I have installed a Mac Mini in my truck and this is the only GPS software available. For my needs, it would be nice to have a better way of searching/adding way-points, and voice direction is a must.I am hopeful that the next version will address these issues or someone will come out with software to resolve these problems."
1,Can't find it way out of it's box while its sitting next to it,"I would give Route 66 a -5 stars. It gives strange and longer routes than you should take. Have actually put in addresses and Route 66 couldn't find it, but when I zoomed in on the map not only did I find the street but when marking a waypoint it gave me the address I typed in the search box. Contacted customer support a few times for different issues and got the same answer each time ""Use the help menu"". I have tried to use the help menu and no matter what you click on it just stays at the index screen. Stay away at all costs. Had a die hard mac friend tell me he would buy an old Windows machine and use Streets and Trips before he would use this piece of junk."
1,Greatly disappointed,"I'm having the same sort of problem. Redraw time is glacially slow. Zooming in will white out the screen, or maybe it's just still redrawing. If your idea of fun is watching the spinning beachball, then this product is for you. Damn DeLorme for discontinuing Street Atlas for the Mac."
2,"Good Try, but Worthless","The map data looks excellent, but the program crashes every time I try to zoom in past the city level. Apparently a lot of others have had the same problem and tech support has no idea. Save your money and buy something else."
4,"It works with OSX Tiger, but...","Seller says this doesn't work with Tiger, but it works. All GPS road map doesn't give the shortest route and this is no exception. Mine came bundled with a GPS receiver that I was surprised worked very well. I just wish I can just install US roads without installing Canada and other non-essential that takes up hard drive space and slows down the search. I'm sure Canadians would want the same if they want to use this and not have to install US info unless they want to. Could be made simpler and faster intuitive locate of streets. I don't need every thing that says San Antonio like a bake shop when I am looking for the city map of San Antonio or just a street. 2005 is almost over and I don't see any updates on their website. Overall I would give this a nod if you want to bring your iBook or PB and use it as a GPS road map, otherwise, spend an extra $300 and get a handheld black and white screen GPS."
1,Absolutely Worthless,Do not waste your hard-earned money on this product. I'd heard it was buggy and slow but in my case I couldn't even get it to load on my TiBook 667 running OSX 10.3.6. multiple emails to the company have been ignored and phone calls are impossible since they are in the Netherlands and list only a fax number. Looks like I'll have to keep using Street Atlas in classic mode.
1,it just doesn't cut it... ugh.,"On the good side, the dozen or so places that I located were correct. That is three more than Street Atlas could locate. The software installed easily and seems to run fine.On the down side, I have not yet been able to interface with my GPS and the instructions are perfectly worthless. Also, the routing is unbelievably bad. For two locations not far from Interstate Highways, Route 66 returns driving routes that jump on and off the Interstate Highways, for all routing options. No one would ever drive the routes it suggests.The Mac community needs a great map and routing program. As it stands today (including the build 3 software release), Route 66 is not it."
2,Krups replacement carafe,"The Krups carafe is generally a long-lasting product. Mine spontaneously cracked after over 5 years of daily use.The replacement I purchased is too new to evaluate durability. It did however arrive with a displaced handle: not centered at exactly 180 degrees from the spout. As a result the lid is also displaced away from center of the spout, giving an incomplete seal of the carafe. Quality control before shipping this product was thus poor."
4,Good transaction,"The item was fine, it just wasn't the one I needed--I actually ordered the wrong carafe, and had to return it. The company responded quickly to my email and processed my refund fast."
2,"We gave it a ""C""","My husband and I are usually big fans of the History Channel and lovers of American history. We thought we would really enjoy ""America: The Story of Us."" Instead, we were very disappointed in this series, which seemed to be made for school-age children as a primer in basic American history. I don't feel my husband and I learned anything we didn't already know.Further, we were both kind of appalled at how much the series focused on the importance of white males in American history. While it's true that slavery and the civil rights movement were both mentioned, as were women unionizing during the industrial revolution, I don't feel that minorities and women got enough credit for their critical roles in shaping American history.As far as I am concerned, this series is a black mark on the good reputation of the History Channel."
1,Liberal Garbage,"This show was awful. It is a left-wing ""social studies"" look at US history through the eyes of our country's most liberal. Third rate computer graphics and left wing commentators like the racist Henry Louis Gates, Al Sharpton, and the metro-sexual extraordinaire Bill Mahr, depict invalid opinions on creation of our great western society.I seriously doubt frontier women would have cared about the opinion of Sheryl Crow even though she's partial to using one sheet of toilet paper..."
1,LIES!,"american history is a white wash of lies.we are really in the toilet with this series folks.are the american people really so helpless and weak that we can not face the truth about where we came from and where we are now?i don't think most americans are!this series is nothing but, the lies our teachers force feed us in school.don't waste your time or money on these lies!go to amazon books and, get a book that deals the real details of american history... 'lies my teacher told me.'also check out the book, 'the art of deception.'critical thinking skills is the cure for the dumbing down of the american people. these two book will give you all an enlighting education.enjoy the eye opening ride of growth and devlopment from those two books!if you love being a ignorant blind sheep... well, it is best i keep my mouth shut.i have a lot of bad and nasty things to say about that."
1,Poor historical content,"As a history teacher I am disappointed that the History Channel would create such a base story of the US. I was especially disappointed with their coverage of the American Revolution, or lack of decent coverage. I watched this program to see if it was something I could use in my classroom to enhance learning but was very disappointed with the result. If you want see glossed over history made for inattentive teens than this the video for you, but if you really want to learn about the wonderfully interesting history of this country there are far better videos out there. I would suggest checking out The Century: America's Time."
1,poorly done,"This series is boring, biased, and offers very little detail or evidence to solidify questionable assertions. It is a failure in historical research and presentation."
2,Not What I Expected,"Very little historical footage, almost all reenactments and comments from folkswho are not authorities. I returned the DVD."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!,"My husband and I loved this series. Even our kids started watching with us. There are so many things we learned that we never heard in school. I have a new awe and appreciation (and even a little shame) for our history and predecessors. Such perserverance and sacrifice in the name of freedom. The ONLY thing that really bugged us both, was the use of celebrity opinions. Kind of killed the credibility and sacredness of the films at times. I mean, had the celebrities been WELL KNOWN for being activists or history junkies, it would have been different. But using popular rappers, musicians, athletes, and actors, to give thier opinion about our history just kind of added a ""yuck"" factor. Keep the opinions to the scholars, the professors of notable universities, or people who are known for having the American qualities being portrayed. Dont use celebrities. Just minimizes the whole effect of the stories being told. Overall...amazing series. Loved loved loved it!!"
3,An Entertaining Overview of The History of America...,"As an armchair history buff I'll start out simply saying I enjoyed this series.The custom footage the History Channel shot is good.So why the three start instead of five?* One drawback, the redundancy of footage with snippets of the film from the Revolution period used to make a different point in the telling of the Civil War, etc.* The other rating consideration is the addition of comments from celebrities such as Michael Douglas Sheryl Crow, and Margaret Cho really didn't do much for me. Noted historians would have been much more relevant.As other reviews have mentioned, this 12 episode series is an overview of American History not a detailed academic or scholarship curriculum.The DVD is worth the $14.95 I paid, especially when considering it has a play time of 720 minutes and is currently contemporary with a release date of 2010."
1,More History Channel Propaganda,"This was the series that made me lose the last ounce of respect I had left for the ""History"" Channel. In the episode that features the Boston Tea Party they wouldn't even call it by that name. I was insulted as an American that their blatant political agenda prevented them from using the term, Tea Party to describe one of the seminal moments in our history. They should call themselves the Propaganda Channel. Disgusting."
2,It's the History Channel so of course it has a conservative slant.,"Definitely a top down 'Great Man Theory' production without any real information on how normal, average people like you or me lived. After all, it is 'The Story of US', right? Or supposed to be. In short, expect more bland stories about Lincoln etc. fitting for an elementary school aged child than any real meaty discussion of 'The Story of Us'.This kind of streamlined storyline that accentuates the leaders seems oddly conservative to me.Maybe not."
1,PC Revisionist History,"I usually never write comments. I was so appalled by this series I had to get another 1 star review on the books. The other reviewers above have said what I would say so I don't want to mimic them. My 9 year old son is a big history buff, we love talking history and when he saw the trailer for this series we made sure to DVR it. After sitting through the first two hours of garbage I made sure to delete the rest of them from our DVR. He still asks about it but I don't have the heart to tell him the truth that it's a bunch of PC revisionist junk. I hope when he gets older the truth will still be out there for him to learn about our country."
1,"Gloss, not much substance","Too politically correct (to today's times and administration), not enough on social injustices if it did not involve African-American decent - specifically Native American, Alaskan and Japanese American (relocation centers/concentration camps). Entertaining, but not a substitute or even supplement for history classes (elementary or better). Too much tie-in to major sponsor (B of A) and poorly timed with bail-out monies. This series is too much in line with elementary and high schools who are deleting sections of American History due to denial of issues, time shortages or funding shortages."
4,Great series.,This series is awesome. Great for my high school students. Only issue is no closed captions. Great price though. Much cheaper than the history channel.
4,Good Series.,"I enjoyed watching this series. I learned a lot regarding America History and although I have read other reviews (some negative) regarding it, I enjoyed it."
3,Comments,"There was some value in this series. There was way too much backtracking when each segment started, much wasted time. They could have made better use of the time if they had left out all the comments by the people such as Trump, Crow, etc.One major omission was the Korean War. It ran from 1952 into 1953 with 36,940 killed, 92,000 wounded, 8,176 still mssing in action, 131 received the Medal of Honor, etc. Why was this not presented and discussed?I realize that 9 hrs,12 minutes is not enough time to really dig into the details.Andy Boeckl"
1,To much meat for 12 short bites,"I wanted to purchase the whole series but decided to ""Netflix preview"" first. I saved a waste of money. I had to take history in college and learned to love it and searched further since even my recollection of my high school history gagged at the lack of detail and supportability. In 1992-4 I made trips to the East coast and visited most of the original fighting grounds and read and watched the material presented at those historical sites. It was touching how they tried to include minorities of ALL persuasions as standout heroes in the struggles. This and the total lack of academic accuracy was insulting and led me to question many of the few details that seemed familiar. I watched the first 3 episodes twice to be fair and invested the time to check the details I wrote down, I can honestly say, wait for it to come out in a ""classic comic"" since it is likely to be a more interesting story and have more detail and accuracy."
2,For beginners only...,"A nice overview for those who know little or nothing about American history. Sadly gets into political correctness unnecessarily. Loses much credibility when the likes of P. Diddy, Sheryl Crowe, Michael Douglass and Al Sharpton are framed and presented in the same way as ligitimate historians...as if they are as well? Lots of other programs out there that get the story right, with credible and believable historians to help tell America's story. Maybe too big of a project? Too hard to keep the PC'ers away? I recommend a 'pass' on this one."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I'll keep it short. Watching the first episode of this series was so frustrating, I surely will not waste any more time (or my children's time for that matter) watching any more. Total junk. The exclusion of Sam Adams and The Stamp Act is unbelievable. This was not just a minor oversight. An analogy would be like doing a documentary of the Beatles and failing to mention John Lennon. I also couldn't believe the people they picked to add commentary. You mean there were no true historians or writers who would have jumped at the chance to lend their expertise to this project? Perhaps they could have rescued it from it's ultimate irrelevance. I was SO looking forward to this series. What a shame."
1,"Totally wrong format, know-nothing celebrities as narrators, worst ""documentary"" i've seen","I'm not sure what the History Channel was looking for with this piece, but I certainly could not stomach this series. It doesn't even really have a point, its just a droning on about random stuff. This could have been a great premise for a series had they done it correctly and without bias. When looking for a GOOD documentary, I usually search for a scholarly commentaried story, not useless dribble from Jon Stewart."
5,amkteach,I love this video series!!! I bought it to show video of the American Revolution to my reading class. The students loved the video as well. It shows like a movie and captures your interest. I'm excited to watch the rest of the video at home for entertainment. :)
3,"Does not have Close Captions or Subtitles (no language at all, not even English)","Does not have Close Captions or Subtitles (no language at all, not even English).And this was not specified in the order.I want to understand if there's another version, and if so, would like to exchange it.- David"
2,This is NOT a documentary,"I REALLY wanted to like this series. In the end it just really fizzled out. Some of the cinematics were pleasing but use of the same CG segments, over and over and over through multiple episodes and documentary facts (and not so factual information) being provided by celebrities instead of historians was downright painful to watch. This series should never be shown again."
2,More missing than there,"There is little historical rigor. The presentation is done by politicians, celebrities, actors, etc, and not by historians.It glosses over so much history that it's quite distracting. It's only informative if you don't know much of the history to begin with.Definitely made more for entertainment and glossy production values than for true education.It could've been titled ""Yay, us!"""
1,America: The Story Of Us,"I thought the story itself was interesting. The only thing I didn't like was the narrator, it becameextremely boring listening to this monotonous voice for the entire set of dvd's. Some people have""the voice"" and other's don't. I don't but then I haven't narrated anything lately, thank God."
1,We don't all have attention deficit disorder,"I don't know history very well, that's why I bought this series. My absolute biggest beef with all of these type shows including the Discovery channel is that they treat us all as ADD (attention deficit disorder) patients by constantly flashing scenes so fast before your eyes that you cannot possible enjoy them, to say nothing of the dizziness, vertigo, and anxiety they cause. They are a bunch of phaggot video editors who hide filming mistakes by flashing them sometimes as many as 4 scenes in one second, (perhaps more). I appreciate fine art and fine video, but this series is typical of Hollywood's ADD style of keeping your eye glued to the set. I actually have to turn my head sometimes and it makes me mad to watch it. So I wouldn't have bought this series had I known how flashy it was. I've stopped watching TV for that reason. To all the video editors and people who cause ADD watching, slow it down so we can enjoy the beauty!!!"
1,Were all the real historians on vacation or didn't the producers try???,"With all the history that was promised, you'd think A & E could find an actual historian to comment on the subject matter. The only historian that I saw was Gillam who provided us with more historical fact in the commerial promos than all of the pseudo celebrities who provided their opinions in their narration of the body of the programming. Some interesting uses of CG (comupter graphic) effects does not warrant the expenditure of the dollars for purchase (even at discount) or even rental. Come on A&E/History Channel, we are not all ""ninnys"" out here. If you're going to pretend to educated, then spend your money with real education and not misinformation."
5,Story of Us,Great Viewing for the whole family. My kids loved it and I learned alot too. The Story of Us is informative and mixes in enough stories about specific people to keep your attention.
2,It's alright.,"I watched the first few episodes with excitement, but like some of the other reviewers found myself disappointed by The History Channel's refusal to acknowledge the philosophical basis of the Revolution. The fact that the 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence committed treason against the King, and that the 13 Colonies seceded from British rule. Production value is very good, content is somewhat slanted (but veiled) from the side those who currently occupy the left side of modern political debate."
2,No closed captions,We watched this on the History Channel when it aired and thought it would make a great gift for my father-in-law because he is really into American history. We were very disappointed to find that closed captions (or English subtitles) was not an option in this DVD. I am still stunned that such a production did not provide the CC option for the hearing impaired. Very disappointing.
2,cheap sensationalism,"I am not a historian, so I cannot judge the historical accuracy of this production.This shows is made to be... a show. The director tries to ""wow"" the audience constantly. Every fact is presented to shock or surprise. So very often this comes up very, very silly: ""the rifled guns used by militia had the range of 250 yards which is 3 times the range of the average shot by a modern day sniper rifle."" So what? How does the maximum range compare with an average shot?I mention ""cheap"" and this is obvious every minute. The same animations are repeated countless of times and the show is bloated with repetitions to artificially extend the length without actually producing additional footage.The problem with this video and with so many other science or history shows released these days is the following: the producers considers us, the audience, as a bunch of easily wowed idiots with no critical thinking whatsoever. Looking at some of the 5-star reviews here, I am afraid they are right."
2,Confused with the statements about Whale Oil and Hubble,I rented Blu-ray version. I was enjoying this as a review of my history knowledge as I studied recently. Then there was a statement about whaling and that even the Hubble telescope uses the whale oil. I started my own search. No where is the information to prove this to be true. Then the feeling of doubt arose. It narrates with authority but I no longer sit and enjoy the learning process. It is stressful that double checking is needed for the show that should enlighten us!
2,Im not sure I can finish watching.....,"Great series so far except each time I see Sheryl Crow talk about rugged individualism, or Michael Douglas talk about hard work, or Sean P Diddy talk about American work ethics I just have to cringe. Why did they have to include these people in the series and to what effect? I can see Neil Armstrong (Modern Day space pioneer), GEN Colin Powell, Giuliani and Bloomberg since they actual worked on behalf of the country. But the authors like Balducci (not a historian) and all the movie stars and music artists detract from the story. I don't hate these people I just don't think they represent real America in the least. They are entertainers and coincidentally not many entertainers have been mentioned so far in this story of America. Are we supposed to believe that in the future people will be reading in history books about the great contributions Hollywood made to this great nation we call America? I hope not."
3,Would be better without P Diddy,"I really liked this series....except for many of the guests they had interspersed throughout. Some were appropriate but others, like Sheryl Crow and P Diddy? I supposed they are trying to make the series interesting for some people. I found it really odd to have these people on there talking about history. Stick to the experts, please."
1,Excellent for teaching my children,"...about what corrupt revisionist ""journalism"" is.All anyone needs to know about the history channel,and this piece of tripe can be witnessed by the factthat while covering the Boston Tea Party as an event,the liberal revisionists carefully never mentioned theword ""Tea Party"" even one time.That is all anyone needs to know about this propaganda effort.What my childrenand their friends were able to take away from this studysays very little about history, and speaks volumes aboutthe history channel."
5,LOVE these series!,"This series is very engaging with their graphics, which are AWESOME! It's like you are almost there. It even taught me a bunch of new concepts that I had forgotten or did not know such as the Erie Canal, Oil discovery, Cotton Gin, the importance of telegraph in the Civil War,It starts with the first Englishmen coming to this country to the 9/11 tragedy, the tv, credit card, technology.If I had a choice of giving my kids,(who don't care for history), either a history book or have them watch these history series, I would definitely have them watch these videos.Highly recommended!"
5,Great Learning tool,"I teach 5th grade, and this is a terrific addition to our Social Studies program. It brings American history alive for my students! It sparked a lot of questions and discussions among the kids."
4,Historical series review,I did not rate this 5 stars because I believe the producers could have gone into a little greater depth. For example the WWII portion of the series mentions the war we fought in Europe but does not expand on our role in defeating Hitler. The video does provide pertinent information and points of reference for further studies. Overall a very well done historical dramatization of America and our American history.
4,This is not a PhD dessertation!,"The first episode introduces ""The Rebels;"" it has been rare in my experience to hear of Puritans and Jamestown settlers referred to as such. Narrator Liev Schreiber tells us that these rebels were ""business men and true believers."" Although I am not a fan of computer generated images in the movies, I am a loyal fan of The History Channel and have never had a problem with their use of CGI. In this series, it looks to be a mainstay of the production along with live action re-enactments of historical events. The technology is so impressive, it's often difficult to distinguish CGI from live action.Read more: [...]"
5,A MUST WATCH!!! A MUST TO OWN!!!,This is a MUST WATCH for anyone living in the USA especially it's citizens. We all forget what it took to make this incredible country and we did it in record time. If you care about the future of the United States then learn about our past and this series brings it to life. WELL DONE History Channel
5,Entertaining,I really enjoyed this series. It is awesome to see how America grew from tiny settlements to the greatest country in the world. Really enjoyed the animation and recreation of events.
5,One of the best documentaries I've ever seen,I learned more by watching this documentary than I did in school! It was captivating and just really well done. Bravo.
5,Great buy & treasure to own.,This is a great way to study American History! We have taken information in it to help children with school projects. It is a great buy and a treasure to own.America: The Story of Us
1,"""Start"" touch pad","Only 3 months after 2 yr warranty expired, my ""Start"" touchpad will NOT work. It has already cost me $26.75 for a repair estimate, and will cost another $79.30 + GST to repair. Panasonic's response: ""TOO BAD"".WARNING: Don't buy Panasonic. Buy a brand that will last longer than 2 years & 3 months."
2,Difficult to read and clean,"Three key problems with this unit:1. The LED display is too small and dim to read easily in bright light.2. The white enamel interior stains easily and often, but stains are nearly impossible to remove.3. Stainless control buttons are small, hard to identify, and difficult to keep clean."
5,Great!,"Not as good as the first two, but way better than the third. Serpent Mage was awesome. I got sooooo mad at Samah when he was deliberately looking for evidence of any kind tha Alfred was a traitor. This is a must-read."
3,A good read.,"A good book, but I thought Haplo should have been able to show his power more.(when dry). Alfred should have been a bit more astute by now also."
3,The only volume not on Kindle,"Great book, one of my favorite in the series, but I'm pretty displeased with the fact that they would overlook having this volume available for Kindle. They made every other one available, why not this one? Stop being such a tease."
1,Buy in Paperback and Save Yourself a Headache,"Before I go into the negative, I'd like to mention that I would give the novel itself five stars, hands down. Like the rest of the series, it is well written, complex, and an absolutely phenomenal read.That being said, the Kindle download of this book was shot to hell. With obvious (and sometimes confusing) typos in just about every single freaking paragraph, it was obvious that there was no attempt to review or edit after the translation to digital. I am ashamed to have paid money for this garbage, and am definitely buying the rest of the books in paperback to save myself the frustration of trying to figure out what what the authors had actually written. I've come to accept a certain amount of errors in my Kindle downloads and can ignore them for the most part, but this was absolutely unacceptable."
4,a great value,This is good foreign language study dvd. I would like to see subtitling in both Spanish/English with options to just view without subtitling as is the case now. 4 stars since I think that the dvd lacks this usability feature.
4,"You should have ""One Minute Stories"", it's better","The book is excellent, but his masterpiece (which is well known in Eastern Europe) is the ""One Minute Stories"""
5,CHRONICALS OF NARNIA,"AMAZING SOUNDTRACK WITH SPECIAL FEATURES- IF YOU ENJOYED THE MOVIE, DO NOT THIS VERSION GET BY YOU.AS ALWAYS, QUICK AND CAREFUL AMAZON SHIPPING."
5,Amazing Soundtrack,"I LOVE the Chronicles of Narnia and this soundtrack is AMAZING! The songs are beautiful. Also, the price is great and it is well worth the buy!"
5,Incredible,"I listen to a variety of soundtracks nearly every day, and this is one of my favorites! I got it years ago when the movie first came out, and I still am azmazed at how much I love it. Very distinct themes, a wide variety of variations and instruments, and an over-all ""magical"" quality makes this soundtrack one of the best around. Even if you are not a Narnia fan (and I am, by the way, a die-hard Lewis/Narnia fan!), you're sure to love this music. ""Lucy Meets Mr. Tumnus"" is enchanting; ""The Battle"" is one of the best ""battle"" scores I've ever heard, and ""Only the Beginning of the Adventure"" is stunning. When the music swells at the end of ""Only the Beginning of the Adventure"", I never fail to get goosebumps! 10 stars!!"
3,Most of the soundrack is good....,I'd say that the most of the soundtrack is really good except for the 4 songs at the end. Not too bad overall.
1,Totally Awesome!,"This is one of the greatest soundtracks ever made, ""Especially"" tracks 14 through the end! BUY THIS SOUNDTRACK, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!"
1,Wunder ugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I like Alanis Morissette, but her voice is so un appealing with this song? I could think of several other artist that could sing this song much better than she can. I swear I wanted to puke when I heard her try to moan this song out. My dog howled in dis- approval, need I say more?"
4,Harry Gregson-Williams,Harry Gregson-Williams all his work is awesome so is this master piece get it
4,One of the Best of the Year!!!!,"I haven't been able to stop listening to this soundtrack since I got it for Christmas the other day! It is a wonderful soundtrack. One thing I love about it is its scale and sense of adventure. Also Gregson-Williams has written a score that is different from Howard Shore's score from The Lord of the Rings. This is a good thing since the two stories are very different from each other. This soundtrack has a range of music that is not to be missed, from the magical sounds in ""From Western Woods to Beaversdam"" to the epic and stunning piece ""the Battle."" Gregson-Williams is truly making his name known with his music. This soundtrack should be an automatic part of anyone's collection!"
5,Harry's Narnia is a winner,"I watched the movie and was a bit disappointed at the almost-muting of the score [maybe its the fault of the theatre, but I digress]. On its own, the score for Narnia is exciting, moving and thrilling. I'm a bit annoyed at the fact that the album brings a few songs [replacing more score tracks] but we still get a healthy dose of music. The songs are nice and Lisbeth Scott's vocals are pretty.Key tracks of the album include:-Evacuating London-To Aslan's Camp-Stone Table-BattleMy personal favorite, not counting the ""Battle"" is ""To Aslan's Camp"" Here we first hear the sweeping, heroic theme and its beautiful. Buy this score and if you haven't done so already, buy Kingdom of Heaven. Two great scores in one year. Harry has to get nominated for at least one."
5,,"I really enjoyed this book because it layed out the movie really well. It explained the movie, recruting the characters, etc... (I'm not going to tell you the rest until you get it and see it yourself.) I believe that its a book that you have to get and read on your own. I have already compleated reading the whole book. It was a very good book and enjoyed it. I hope that you get this product since it is worth the $$'s!"
5,A Magnificant Soundtrack:,"this is prehapes one of the greatest soundtracks out there. I am bold enough to say that it even rivals John Williams work. The music it self is moving and emotional. The soundtrack is a great companion to anyone who saw the film or ahs read the books, I highly recommend it."
4,"Different Style, But Fresh","When I first heard his song titled ""Vibe"", I loved it!! The only reason I know of Calvin Richardson is because he was being interviewed on a television program and he sung one of his songs. I think his music is a mixture of jazz and blues, but it is a fresh style which is unique. That is when I purchased his album titled ""Country Boy"". I played his album for my friend and she loved it also. I just wish they would play his album on the radio so that he could get exposure. He is very talented and should go far. It is refreshing to have a different style and different type of flavor!!"
5,...yall have no clue what yall are missin out on...,"...""ray-dee-oh-suckers never play me"" - chuck d.a very appropriate quote for this release...this is perhaps one of the best adult (meanin 'grown' - not meanin 'gutter') r&b; album debuts by any male vocalist. universal oughta be ashamed of themselves for not pushin this the way it shoulda been...lissenin to this gave me flashbacks of bobby womack and stevie wonder; this is a very well-crafted album...no studio pyrotechnics: jus a show-case for quality soul music...this is jus that somethin-real; somethin which yall all really need anyway. stop missin out...."
4,Recommended,"It's a mystery to me why this album isn't selling better. He has a great voice unlike some of his peers (Case, Jagged Edge) and good production, and even some high-profile guests (K-ci of Jodeci, Chico Debarge, Monifah), but it just doesn't sell. However, if you enjoy soulful, sultry, love-making music, that is subtle at the same time, this album is for you. There are no really weak tracks on this album, but four are worth mentioning. His duet with K-ci shows the two of them harmonizing beautifully, his remake of Bobby Womack's ""Trust Me So Much"" is worthy, and ""Looks Like You've Been Crying"" and ""Nightmare (Her Love)"" are great songs as well. If you're sick of today's R&B full of sex or if you appreciate good R&B, go get it, you won't regret it."
3,"Calvin Richardson - Country Boy (Universal, 1999)","If I heard this album back when it came out, I wouldn't have been too impressed. Cuts like ""I'll Take Her"" (featuring K-Ci) and ""Vibe"" are hot but other songs fall victim to average songwriting and overbearing vocals. Yes, Calvin can sing but he doesn't have to try so hard. His second album, 2:35 PM, is a vast improvement so I say go pick up that one instead. You're not missing much with this album. -EJR"
5,Highly Recommended,"I love this CD. I first heard of Calvin through Angie Stone talking about how great he was in an interview and she is so right. ""I'll Take Her"" is my favourite track. There are no bad tracks on this album. Another favourite is ""Half the Time"". This is a must have CD if you love good soulful vocals. I can't wait for his next release."
1,Are you kidding me?,"To the guy who rated this game well... You must work for speedcoshooting. Because NO ONE in their right mind would actually rate this game with 5 stars. I'd rate it with 0 but I have to put something on there. This is probably the worst, most mind-numbing game on the planet. You can't even move, you are basically limited to two button. R for reloading, space to fire. To think this game has any merit must mean you are clinically insane."
5,Good Product,"A very simple product and easy to install. I needed a doorbell for an antique door bell, and this product works fine with what I needed."
1,1 week and screws are rusting.,"Screws are not stainless steel so when you screw them in the paint chips off the screw a little and then starts rusting immediately. Stay away, buy stainless steel."
3,Catchy but repetitive,"I'd never heard the Bats until I was browsing through their entry in Musichound and thought I might like them. While there are no dogs on this CD, there isn't much diversity either. The vocals are not irritating but not interesting or standout. I wish there had been a couple of tracks where the girl sang lead. The musicianship is solid but doesn't catch your ear. This group probably sounds best in a multi-artist compilation, since their strong point is the consistent catchiness of the melodies. Listening to it front to back gets a bit old."
1,Nordic Ware Cooking/Baking sheet 13.5 x 14 Inch - Ha!,I'll never know how well this baking sheet might have worked. The advertised measuements are not correct. It is actually 15 1/2 inches long and will not fit in oven! Thanks for wasting my time! DT
5,It is a cookie sheet.,I bought this one against the evil day when something terrible happens the identical sheet I've had for some years. The one I've had for years does what I want it to.
2,Needs a remastering job!,"The music is five star but the audio is taken from vinyl, the main thing missing is bass, it's been rumoured that the master tapes were lost in a fire but there are always sub masters made and usually every country of release will have a different sub master (added EQ, compression or limiting), so we should have a better version one day, if Frank Marino can get back rights from the record label!"
1,bubu,"have to agree with most of the other reviews, i consider what's next to be frank marino's best album but black rose did such a poor job on the cd that it's almost wasted money. only reason i won't throw it away is because i don't know where i can get a good copy of this disc"
1,refund,"This was ordered by accident by my son. I asked for a refund, told I would get one and haven't received it as yet. That's a month or more ago."
2,Awesome album; HORRIBLE mix,"Awesome album; HORRIBLE mixI'm a fan from way back, and I love What's Next, but Black Rose records put out a criminally mixed release this CD. It is so distorted with such clipping and bad levels, that it actually, physically hurts my ears. Keep your old albums/tapes of this material until some other company comes out with a new release of it."
4,Good travel compass to work with GPS,"This is a small compass, easy to carry. It has a small whistle which I suppose can come in handy. Mostly it is small, seems well built, and compact. The orange color makes it easy to find in a pack. I fond it great for showing just which way is NORTH.My main use for it is assisting many GPSs, of which may have electronic compasses but not all. A small traditional compass can quickly re-orient you."
1,Not what I thought,I didn't really know what this was but it was not what I expected. I give it to my mother to sell in the fleamarket. It was my fault. I should have read the description better I guess.
2,Disappointing,"I did not care much for this book. It was BORING! Students are bambarded with fact after fact to memorize without any attempt to really tell a story and make it at all interesting. Was disappointing, and I had to supplement with Mystery of History, which also covers the same material as the the beginning of the abeka book, but tells the story of the people and the facts in a very interesting and memorable way. I will have to find something else to supplement for the middle of the abeka book to the end."
2,Review,"It had more damage than I expected, but not enough to not be able to use it. The cover was really torn up in one corner, so we just had to tape it up."
2,It is just OK,"If you don't get the stunt right, you have to start over. This is not anything like the Stuntman games on PS2. I will give this game a few more tries, but my rating stays the same. It is more annoying than fun."
1,Crap,"Not fun, to hard especially for little kids, and boring! for the record i did beat it, but gave it away for free a month later!"
1,horrible,"I bought the PS2 Stunman game and I hated it. The handling for the cars is horrible. Most of my energy was spent trying to get the car to do what I wanted it to. The game play was also very repetitive, and the voice-over told you what to do after you were half-way through the mark.I played the demo, and the only thing that was improved for the new version was the graphics. It still had the same gameplay issues. My friend tried playing the demo too and had the same complaints that I do. I would give this game two stars for a good concept, but I wanted to counter act the five star from the guy who posted song lyrics."
5,Who wants to be a stunt driver?,"I had gotten my hands on a demo version, or maybe I rented this one? - Can't remember. Anyway, it was a blast! I had to have one for myself!Many great things about this game, it's fast paced and can become addicting. I found the need to beat my own scores and challenging otherswas another bonus with the multi-player mode.Hard to put down the controller! This was absolutley the BEST driving game I've ever played!"
4,"OHNO! ""ROC C.""IS IN THE BUILDING.(GET IT?)","You can buy this album for the beats alone.Then there's ROC C.To be honest,dude has got to be one of the bright spots of the whole year thus far.This is definitely on some '83 to '94 vibe.Best track ""El Capitan""(w/Chino XL OR without).Do yourself a favor and 'GO COP DAT'!"
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered this book based on the fantastic reviews, but it was not what I expected, and I returned it. I was looking for a book for a young boy (4)who recently lost his father to Leukemia. This book might be good for young children who are very angry and going through the extreme emotions that can happen with a loss like this, but the boy I wanted to give this to is not having such extreme emotions. He is sad, as can be expected, and misses his Dad, but he's not acting out in anger or ""mad at the world"", as the boy in this book. Maybe this would be better suited to someone who had more of a sudden loss, and isn't coping well emotionally. It just wasn't right for the situation in my case. Overall, I felt it was too negative, and just not the right choice for someone who is already coping with a loss in a healthy way."
4,Enjoyable fun music,"While I am not a great Van Morrison fan, although I have followed his career for more than 40 years [I first saw him live in 1967] I like this little album quite a lot. Country music has never been one of my favorite genres, but Van and Linda make it sound quite enjoyable for me here. Of course it is not one of the great master pieces of the last half century, but I find I often enjoy the little not so polished gems more. Very good backing band and mostly a nice choice of songs [even Cadillac sounds OK to me]. And the fun all the musicians had making this record comes through very clearly. So in my opinion it is definitely enjoyable fun music."
3,Would have been better without Linda....,"I thoroughly enjoyed this exploration of roots rock and country, but let's face it.....Van and Linda's voices blend like oil and water. They flat out don't sound good together and give the CD an awkward, almost karaoke-like feel. If Van had done these same songs on his own, this disc would be quite a bit better. I would also be interested to hear Linda Gail Lewis solo......but she just doesn't measure up next to a legend like Van Morrison. I'd recommend this for Van die-hards only."
4,Van and Linda Gail duets - never woulda dreamed...,"I snapped this one up as soon as I saw it. What prompted this snapping was the name Linda Gail Lewis and the songlist. Anyone who has ever heard even one Jerry Lee/Linda Gail duet knows it's gotta be good (fans check out ""When You Wore A Tulip"" on The Jerry Lee Lewis Show, Magnum Force Video). Well, Van is a fine vocal stylist and classic songwriter, but he ain't no JLL when it comes to rockin' up a storm - the well selected numbers are given polite treatment here. The standouts are the Lee Lewis-related ""Let's Talk About Us""; ""Think Twice Before You Go""; and Bo Diddley's almost unknown masterpiece ""Cadillac"". All the tracks are fun, but the compressed, electronic atmosphere does not provide for the true country soul and sensuality of Linda Gail."
5,Jump. Jive and Dance 'til You Drop,"It's hard to pinpoint any musician with such a unique voice and diverse recording catalog as Van Morrsion.If you're a fan of Blues, make that dancable blues, you'll love this CD of classic recordings. With the help of Linda Gail Lewis, Van makes it clear that these are songs he loves to sing and wished he had wrote.If you like the new/old hip sounds of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies and Mighty Mighty Boss Tones, you'll groove to this collection."
3,A Near-Hit,"Van has a great voice and I love the song selections on this album. Linda Lewis is a great piano player but would be best advised not to sing. It's a shame because I really thought this had potential. I saw them do ""Real Gone Lover"" on Leno last night and couldn't believe it. I believe it would sell like crazy if you could lift her voice from the tracks. When I heard about this album I was excited about the song selections and thinking of Van doing duets with ""The Killer's"" sister made it even more difficult to wait on. I guess I was just a little disappointed, maybe had too high of expectations."
3,Uneven,"This is neither a great recording nor a bad recording. The good parts are really, really good and the rest is really, really awful. Morrison's voice has not sounded this good in quite awhile and his singing is ""energetic"" which hasn't been the case in quite awhile either. The pure rock and the blues based songs are terrific and worth the cost of the disk However he sings harmony (of sorts) with Gail Lewis on almost every line of every song and it gets in the way on the rest of the songs. I kept thinking as I listened to it that I wish I had a way to electronically erase her voice. What is clear though is Morrison is having fun and you can tell it in his voice."
4,I'll Wait for Van's Next Period,"Van is consistently the most interesting musical artist of the last 30 years because he's always into something new. From rocker to hippie balladeer to Irish soul man back to R&B( A Night in San Francisco is the most incredible live album I've ever heard) I saw him at Jazzfest recently and at Madison Square Garden a few years ago and frankly, he's gotten a little boring. Yes, anything Van does is head and shoulders above the dreck that is contemporary music. I just can't wait to see where he goes next. Hmmm... maybe a 30 year(or so)anniversary live Astral Weeks at Carnegie Hall....."
1,Did Van Lose a Bet?,"What was Van thinking when he did this C.D.? Van Morrison ranks in my book as one of the the all-time greats, but I don't understand his need to do this C.D. The concept is good, Van doing some old rockabilly, fifties tunes, but where & why does Gail Lewis come in? If Van felt the need to do something with a female singer, why not his daughter? My guess is he owed Jerry Lee a favor of some kind. Do yourself a favor, take the money that you were going to spend on this and buy Emmylou Harris's new one--""Red Dirt Girl"", you'll have the best C.D. of 2000, instead of the worst!"
1,A Waste of Money,"If no stars were an option that is what I would have given this CD. I purchased it based solely on the fact that I am a Van Morrison fan. Well, I should have managed a way to hear it once before buying it. I love duets but I don't feel that Lewis and Morrison's voices meld at all. It has a poor quality honkey tonk sound to it. Also, it has a County Western feel to it. As I said, this was a total waste of money and I hope I can find someone to give it to."
2,OUCH!,"Why Van ever decided to do this side project is a mystery. The music is predictable, given that he teams up with Jerry Lee Lewis's sister (roots rockers, including tunes by Hank Williams, John Lee Hooker, & Lewis himself). Although she certainly inherited her brother's ability on piano, Linda Gail Lewis's voice is unexceptional, bordering on irritating. And the combination of the two voices certainly doesn't work. If you're looking for this type of music, you'd be much better off going with Jerry Lee himself."
1,You Win Again,I am a big Van Morrison fan and I was soooo disappointed with this CD. I don't like it at all. I didn't like the duets and I didn't like the songs. I like every CD I have of Van Morrison but this one.
1,you win again,The duets here (only from the sound bites) sound as if 2 singers are singing the songs at the same time. The voices don't blend well together. Linda Gail Lewis doesn't hold her twanging in check and does'nt harmonize well with Morrison (who sounds as wonderful as usual). It is hard to have 2 singers singing lead at the same time.
1,going through the motions...,"I had to respond after reading the last review. Who are you kidding? If anyone's phrasing and tempo have made in impossible to harmonize with it is Van's. Look, Van has been one of the most emotive and inspired singer/songwriters of the last 30 years, but recording duets with Van at this point in his career is simply a bad idea. The duets he did with his daughter on ""Days Like This"" had the same problems - two vocalists with different phrasing, intonation, and execution. It almosts hurts to listen to it. I love him dearly, and Linda's efforts are admirable, but I'll stick with Moondance and Astral Weeks."
1,Awful,Is Van just tired? Did he owe Linda Gail Lewis a big favor (sorry I don't know who she is). What a terrible record - Van reaches a new low. Not even worth a listen for hard core Van fans like myself.
4,Good but,"I like this disc a lot. The music is great. My one complaint: Why in the world on the one song that Morrison actually wrote on this disc, ""No Way Pedro"", did he take the Lord's name in vain? And on a throw away line. I listen to music with my kids. This is one more disc I won't play for them."
5,Best Ever,"My love of music started with the Stones, Beatles and Who in the 60's, oh yes there was another great influence: THEM, like G.L.O.R.I.A., like Van Morrison. He was great them, he's only gotten better. I don't know how he came across the sister of Jerry Lee Lewis for this Duet album, but he ""hit the nail on the head""(see Amazing Rhythm Aces). If you like good old fashioned Rock & Roll with a bit of Rhythm & Blues and Country Goodness, this has got to be the tops for you too. I hadn't heard any recent music of Van's for years until last week laying in bed watching Jay Leno, when out comes a rockin' Van & Linda Gail. I got up early the next day and bought the best Album I've ever heard in many years. I can guarantee you this one won't get lost with the 700+ other CD'd I've collected in my 15 years as a paid professional Disk Jockey. Play it loud and be ready to start dancing! I love it! This is what Rock & Roll is all about!!"
1,Youth Sweatpants,It came without a package and they were dirty. I wouldn't buy clothes again off the internet if they can't even put them in packing!
3,Throw is okay.,The throw is a good size but not nearly as soft as I expected. It was a gift for my husband who is a huge Steeler's fan. I would not buy this product again.
4,Una Storia Segreta,"A must read for all Italian Americans (and other ethnic groups). Makes you understand the struggle and,yes, the prejudices suffered by these and many other immigrants. For me as an Italo-American it was a shock and surprise that my ethnic people were treated as ""aliens"" as described herein. To think that ""these"" people left everything behind to find a new and ""better"" life in America. The only negative comment I would have about this book, is that it is a compendium of stories; nevertheless I strongly recommend it be read!"
3,Go back to Hemlock Falls...,"This novel, although readable, proves that Quill and Meg belong at the Inn. Without the supporting cast of characters, the book drags."
4,Winter vacation in Palm Springs,"While the cold winds are blowing around the Inn at Hemlock Falls in New York State, Sarah and Meg Quilliam are on their way to Palm Springs. They have been invited by Tiffany Taylor to speak to a group of phobic women about innkeeping and cooking, the two subjects they know best. When they discover the type of phobia these women have, they become reluctant to participate. Then they witness some shouting matches between Tiffany and her ex-husband Verger and they are really ready to return home. The plot is complicated by yet another of Verger's ex-wives and their two sons. There is a murder and a disappearance and suddenly the Quilliam sisters are right in the middle of the investigation. Although I missed the usual cast of characters from Hemlock Falls, I still enjoyed this ""cozy""."
5,Home improvements,"Great looking product, sturdy. Looks very modern. Would recommend highly. Bought along with several other Gatco Channel items and they all look great!"
2,Plastic and is not solid,"I got this towel holder because I thought it was modern looking with premium quality. The bar is plastic/ very thin, and where it all connects together it wobbles. The toilet paper roll holder was the same poor quality. The look is great, but that's all that is great about it. Double check tightness of the rod that connects to the wall plate it wobbles too. The wall plate is not flat against the wall when tightened down and you can see a paper thin gap next to the wall"
3,A Theosophical Treatise,"From the perspective of each of the religions whose founders are discussed, this book will seem to be very inaccurate, even offending. The reader should understand that this book is not religion or theology, it is theosophy.Not that I am an expert in this area, but it seems to me that this book is an accurate representation of the beliefs of theosophists. The origin of the races, the meaning and significance of religious symbolism, the advent of individuals who could bring spiritual truth to mankind by a mystical process are all the tennents of theosophy.If you are an historian, this book can provide you an interesting view of theosophical beliefs, at least around the turn of the 20th century. Likewise if you are a theologian. Schure's descriptions of the life and process of the great persons he covers is worth reviewing because they were mystical persons or at minimum practiced mystical religions."
5,"Powerful music, but too short","James Newton Howard's music for ""The Sixth Sense"" is brilliant. It is deeply moving, disturbing and - yes, at times even scary. It powerfully depicts the atmosphere of the movie. I wouldn't have missed it for anything in the world. The only problem with the album: it only includes 30 minutes of music. For instance, the music for the main titles and end credits is missing completely. I can only hope that at some point in time, a recompilation album will appear which gives us more."
2,Missing the most important part,"Normally, when I spend money on a soundtrack, I expect the main theme to be a part of it. Anyone who's seen the movie knows that there is a very moving musical theme which runs from the main credits all the way through to the ending credits. Mixed in with that, as is done in all movies, are various pieces which set particular moods and change the tempo or feeling of the story. This album seems to be composed of only those little pieces. The main theme, nor any of its variations, is anywhere on this soundtrack album. Perhaps this is an ""art"" thing with the person who put the compilation together, but as a paying customer who saw the movie and loved the theme music, I was extremely disappointed with this album."
3,too short and stuff are missing,"I bought this score because I thought the main title was going to be on there, but it wasn't.It has some good parts. ""Stir of Echoes""(the soundtrack) is a whole lot better."
4,"A nicely creepy, low key score that hooks you","The score by James Newton Howard borrows some elements from other movies(ex. Bad Company) but it still is a very effective score that gets better every time you listen to it. It had none of those sudden BOOM! noises that make your ears go deaf but instead creates a relaxing and yet scary mood while listening. After I listened to it in the morning, I couldn't get it out of my head all through the day. Now THAT's an effective score!"
3,Great Soundtrack!,"James Newton Howard is one of my favorite composers, this may not be my absolute favorite, it is however a soundtrack that very much has a right to exist, altough a bit on the short side. It never fails to bring you right back in to the movie the moment you close your eyes, and listen to the music. Definitely not his best work, but nonetheless a great score."
5,I'm Brian Fellows!,"Tracy Morgan has to be one of my favorite cast members! I'm not going to give all the skits away so I'm just going to mention my favorites on this DVD: Homeless Sewer Guy, Pimp Chat, Hardball (with an appearance with John McCain!!!), the Weekend Updates, and of course BRIAN FELLOWS! I could watch a whole DVD with just Brian Fellows! The one clip I wished they would have thrown in here is the Tiger Woods one, where he was Tiger's dad. The only clip I think the DVD could have done without is Barflies one at the end. I didn't really think that one was fun at all. I think this is definately worth a purchase as I laughed all the way through."
4,Worth it just for,Astronaut Jones!!! and Brian fellowes.....rest of the dvd is pretty boring...if you really dont want to laugh watch his audition...its about as funny as a stroke.
2,Tracy Morgan is funny this collection is not!,"The good aspects of this DVD collection of SNL star Tracy Morgan is Brian Fellows, The Ex-Porno Stars skit, King Kong, father son skit with Shack, and the pimp skit. The other skits are annoying and not funny. Also the Dominican Lue scene is too brief and not one of the hilarious ones. The part when Tracy portrays Star Jones is only for half a minute (yeah it was very funny too) and then it quickly transitions into some other very lame skit at a bar that did not make me laugh nor did it make sense."
3,SNL Stars,"I am sure this is a nice DVD but where in the heck is the Cheri Oteri SNL DVD? Hou can you have a Tracy Morgan ""Best of"" and still not not have a Oteri DVD. She is tons funnier than Morgan."
2,Noisy when grinding,The coffee maker makes an incredible amount of noise when grinding the coffee beans. It was so loud that it awoke my grandson to the point of making him cry from the noise level. The coffee is alright but I didn't like the amount of noise just to get a cup of coffee.
3,"Coffee is good, but product lifetime is short","I just bought my second Mr Coffee grind and brew. I like the product, but my first one only lasted 14 months before the grinder quit. I will give it one more chance. Customer service at Mr Coffee was of no help with suggestions for extending the life of the grinder. The replies to my questions were like ""duh""?"
1,terrible,We bought this item at Target. We returned it after a month of use because the grinder stopped working. We got another one. The same thing happened. We tried one more. This one lasted the longest 5 months. It died yesterday. I cannot justify 60 dollars on this coffeemaker. It would be more fun to watch that money swirl down the toilet.
1,Still Looking for the best Grind and Brew,"I was very disappointed with this coffee maker. I replaced it after few short months. The coffee was just awful! I scoffed at the other reviews with the tasteless coffee due to perhaps the type of beans they were using. I was wrong. I do not recommend this machine Along with more Cuisinart coffee makers than I care to admit to....the best grind and brew is the Melitta 10 cup (how I wish for a 12 cup from them) programmable...not the expensive one. It makes GREAT tasting coffe. You can choose your coffee strength, etc. etc. Also easy clean. I came out to purchase one today as I had replaced the Mr. Coffee with yet another Cuisinart....which after regular cleaning and only about 6 months takes a hour to brew a pot. But I digress. This is supposed to be about the Mr. Coffee. A poor, poor appliance."
2,Not very good,"I got this coffee maker because I wanted the fresh flavor from the beans. I had previously used a seperate grinder. I was very disappointed in the coffee it made. Very weak. It has a button for stronger brewed coffee, and that still doesn't help. The beans aren't able to be ground fine enough it seems to make a decent cup of coffee. If I can't find a better one, I'll go back to grinding them seperately."
3,Short Service Life,"The greatest drawback to this coffee maker is the loudness of its grinding function, like a plane taking off in our kitchen. But we were willing to accept that feature and even had some laughs over it. I got a good buy on it at Walmart, $48.00, and it made a good tasting cup of coffee. Unfortunately it worked for only 1 year and 3 months. The warranty is, of course, for 1 year. Taking that into consideration, $48.00 was not such a good deal. We will try another brand."
1,Shame on Mr. Coffee....,"I normally only review really good or really bad products, and this one is REALLY BAD! I've had this coffeemaker for six months, (and actually didn't use it at all for half of that time because I had a fling with green tea.) Recently the grinding chamber literally disintegrated, the plastic parts broke at the points where they were fastened onto the main chamber--even though I carefully washed and handled it according to the directions in the manual. I went to the website to find a repair center, drove one hour to the closest one, and found it had closed up at least 6 months ago! The flavor of the coffee was mediocre. I will not purchase another Mr Coffee again...a waste of time, money and poor customer service."
2,They Could Have Done it Better,"Like most of the other reviewers, I've had some problems with this machine. After my old Melitta fell apart, I got one of these at Walmart on sale for under 40 dollars. Results were: the noise-upstairs neighbor actually complained-, lack of bean capacity in the grinder-six scoops of beans for 12 cups is not enough for a stout brew-, you can't set the timer and the strong setting, in fact you have to set it to strong after it finished grinding...Etc, etc, etc....After a couple of weeks the grinder died because I was packing 8+ scoops of coffee in there. The company is sending me a new one, which will be going on sale, unopened, on ebay."
1,Disaster Brew,"My wife picked up one of these because she wanted to have her coffee already made when she wakes up in the morning. Unfortunately, the grinder pushes coarse grounds into the filter, and the water only pours onto half of the grounds, creating a brew so weak that it doesn't even taste like coffee. We're returning it to the store. Years ago, we had a Cuisinart grind/brew combination, and that one worked okay until the little plastic tab broke off the top of it. Don't waste your money on this turkey."
2,Should I return this?,"That is the question. While the previous reviews of this coffee maker being hard to clean are a bit exaggerated; the real issue is the weakness of the coffee that the machine makes, and the capacity of the grind chamber. The only way I could get a nice cup of coffee, was to only brew 6 cups (two in my world), and fill the grind chamber to capacity with beans, and select the strong option (of which I am not entirely convinced does anything at all).All in all, A machine this big for 6 cups (two) of O.K. coffee isn't worth it in this case.*EDIT- Oh yeah the high pitch beeping when coffee is complete? Completely annoying."
3,Not bad for the price,I purchased for 60.85 and it makes a pretty good cup of coffee for the price. My biggest complaint is that the design of the carafe makes it nearly impossible to pour a cup of coffee without spilling. The only other complaint I have is that the clean up of the many parts can become tedious. Overall not a bad machine.
3,"Great story, but felt a little let down at the ending","I loved the whole premise of this story - the idea of young people being raised in schools that trained them for heading into the deep reaches of space and then thrown out there with no further supervision or help. I think the author did a excellent job of being realistic on what the initial results would be, but it was as if she didn't know where to go for an ending and just said 'oh well, maybe they will survive and maybe they won't - I have no more idea's let's just leave it there.' It is probably just be but if I receive this type of ending I am really looking for a sequel."
2,Could have been better,"Sometime in the future, the human race realizes how much the population is outgrowing the planet and decides to train people to go explore the galaxy to look for other inhabitable planets. The trainees are chosen for their intelligence at a very young age, then spend their entire childhood learning a skill such as medicine, engineering, physics, etc. When they reach adulthood, the best six of them are sent off to other star systems to spend the rest of their lives searching for a place that may be hospitable to humans. This is the story of one such group.The premise is good, but I think this story had more potential than it lived up to. Too many details seemed unbelievable and the characters remained undeveloped. Better written novels by Marion Zimmer Bradley include The Mists of Avalon and The House Between the Worlds."
3,Wrong item,I ordered a green screen and received a tan one. Never got the item I asked for just a refund.
1,very disappointed,this item was not at all what i expected and it is misrepresented and we were very disappointed with this item!!
2,Expected better,Speed of shipping was awesome but the product quality was less than I expected. The zippers are very fragile and I am using them as little as possible. The netting snags very easily and I don't think this product will hold up to more than one year of use.
5,replacement gazebo screen,"I purchased this screen for my gazebo. It fits very well, looks great & best of all keeps the bugs off of me."
4,Nice addition to the gazebo,"This makes a nice addition to the gazebo. Of course, it's the typical quality that you'd expect from an Asian manufacturing facility be it China, Taiwan, etc. But it will last at least a few years if you don't abuse it and store it during the winter. Even when it does wear out, it's not that expensive to replace. It has a few nice touches like an elastic button device that will allow you to tie back the sides like a curtain to allow the screen to open like a tent if unzipped. It took a little bit of figuring out, since it comes devoid of any instructions (Engrish or otherwise). Just remember the screen goes on the *inside* of the gazebo structure and not around the metal corners and you'll be fine."
2,misleading,"When I purchased this item I got the impression that the kit (looking at the picture) included everything but the gazebo - which is the frame.You should be more specific and mention that the kit is just the screen around the frame and the top cover was not part of the kit. I need the top part of the gazebo more than the screen around it. The title of this item should say: ""gazebo screen"" and not ""gazebo screen KIT""...Unhappy customer"
3,Too Loose,"I was really excited to find this replacement top for my gazebo, but when we put it on, my excitement was gone. Though it is a well built cover, it fits very loose on the gazebo. The original top fit so tightly that is was almost hard to get on. This one was easy to put on because it was so loose. When it rained the other day, large amounts of water pooled in the top. I am very disappointed about that. I am having to construct supports with bungies and clamps to tighten it up. I double checked my measurements before I ordered so I was very surprised with the poor fit."
4,MARVIN GAYE LIVE AT THE LONDON PALLADIUM,I REALLY LOVE MARVIN GAYE I HAVE A BIG COLLECTION OF HIS SONG AND WAS GLAD TO ADD THIS CD BELIEVE ME IT WAS WORTH IT
2,A wholly undeserved reputation,"Sinfest takes a few risqu√© topics, like sex and religion, and manages to make them bland. Devil girls in tank tops and a lecherous Calvin clone can only take you so far, eventually you need humor beyond the standard Syndication fare. Even the artwork, despite portraying said devil girls, hasn't been cutting edge in fifty years.With all the innovative and funny webcomics out there today you can find better things to read."
5,WoW !,"It's all been said before by other 5-star reviewers...and I crave other comics from Tatsuya Ishida - he is very good, too good for syndication, even!"
3,So-So,"I'm not sure what I was expecting with this book.I read Anaya's ""Bless Me Ultima"" and enjoyed it. I figured ""Zia Summer"" would be no different.But it was. The flow was a bit choppy. Anaya fluctuates from spending pages discussing Chicano/Hispanic culture to the actual murder mystery plot. It came across as forced to me.""Bless Me Ultima"" was literature. ""Zia Summer"" was pulp fiction trying to be literature. Sadly it didn't even succeed (for me) as a sordid-page-turner-can't-put-it-down-whodunnit. I had no problem setting this book down from time to time.Overall enjoyable, but a letdown for Anaya readers used to his more intelligent writings."
2,I was disappointed.,"First, the hero, Sonny Baca, is a bit of a dolt. I'm not sure if he was written that way on purpose or not and that is part of the problem.Second, I figured out the answer to the ""mystery"" immediately after a certain character was introduced. It was that obvious.Third, the villians are reputed to be totally evil yet their stated goals were worthy albeit the methods for obtaining them were violent and terrible. The author never addressed that contradiction.Overall, there seemed to be a confusion of intent. That being said, the story had a lot in it that was diverting and interesting but I can't really recommend it."
2,Jazzmatazz is a no-no,"Alright I can't lie... I am really not feeling this album I bought it with high hopes but surely I was let down... Yet I have to admit the tracks ""Keep Your Worries"", ""All I said"" and ""Plenty"" were plenty tight... but that was only due to the featuring artists... His rap style is simple which I like but at the same time it is not advance, not very articulate and not enticiing... it doesn't pull me in with head banging lyrics, it doesn't capture me with the nicest compilation of eclectic (electric) rhythms. His style is like that of the 80's , kind of monotonous, kind of boring if you ask me... but that is my opinion don't let what I say stop you... Most people who bought this album were fans of his previous releases and dig his sytle but I can't say the same."
1,Just Too Damn Mellow,"I'm down with the jazzier hybrids. I'm down with the cool guest stars. I'm down with Guru's deadpan rapping style. And I'm definitely down with Jazzmatazz Vol. I, which was plenty of good fun.What I'm NOT down with is this album because, frankly, the rhythms are so limp. Laid back is okay once in a while but there is not one cut here that I would spin live while deejaying--it's all so damn sleepy. Nothing ever rises above midtempo at best, and the downside of having lots of ""jazz"" all over it is that there are no hooks--just lots of watery, bland music."
3,Nice spicy overtone but the pumpkin flavor needs to be stronger.,"Doing harvest, Halloween and Thanksgiving lollipops so pumpkin is a must. Love the overtone of the spices but actual pumpkin flavor was lacking."
2,The concept and the music are incompatible.......,"I'm not exactly sure what made Al feel impelled to enlist Laurence Juber as the producer of this project, but I must say very bluntly that it was a mistake. He cannot shoulder all of the blame however, because Al should have known, via his album Russians and Americans, that theme albums don't always work. Yes, I would have to admit that this work does have a Napa Valley cellar feel to it, but the songs are merely fair. I return to this cd to hear Millie Brown, but all else misses the mark in pacing and appeal."
2,Down in the Cellar,"A few years back, Al Stewart brought back the idea of a concept album in Between The Wars. He tries to do this again in Down in the Cellar with the focus being on Wine. The problem is that it doesn't go anywhere. The songs, with the exception of House of Clocks, just don't work.It irony is that Mr. Stewart recorded this CD for an US audience, but the record company that was going to distribute it went out of business before the album came out. It's available in Europe under the EMI lable.While Down in the Cellar is interesting, it's no gem."
4,Like a Fine Wine,"Like a fine wine, January 28, 2003Al Stewart fans rejoiced when this album had its limited release. Now widely available, it is a must have for all fans of this master story teller. ""Down in the Cellar"" is a treasure of wine related tales that grow with each listen. Perhaps it takes a little longer to appreciate the fine writing, storytelling and music, than the usual Al Stewart material, ""Down in the Cellar"" is a full of wonderful vignettes of time, memories and dusty wine-tinged songs. Standouts: ""House of Clocks"", ""Under a Wine-Stained Moon"", ""Sergio"", ""Tasting History"". The musicians are outstanding as always.This is a good one that ages very well."
5,Intoxicating...,"Al Stewart just keeps on delivering great albums. This is one of my favorites from his recent releases. All the songs are about wine - from the fun side in ""The Night that the Band Got the Wine"" to more thoughtful and prosaic songs that perfectly capture the fascination and intrigue of great wines. This is a record that could have been pretentious. But Al's a great communicator, whether he's telling you a story from history or simply capturing an emotional love affair. The title track is superbly catchy, but quite honestly there is not a bad track on this album. Recommended without hesitation. If you've not tried an Al Stewart album, this - or Time Passages (from a different era) - would be a very good place to start."
3,A little confused,"I recieved this item right on time. The gun works wonderfully, spraying a very fine mist. That would be fine except that the tanning soulution i revieved was not of the same brand depicted. Also the tan extender that came was not the same as the one depicted, infact its not even an extender, its a sunburn releif. Why would i need this after a spray tan? Im looking into getting a better liquid tan for the gun, and once i find one im sure ill be much happier with the product. Overall not bad, but a little missrepresentd."
2,A waste of money,"First, the tanning solution bottle appeared to have been previously opened, or at least the foil inside the cap that seals the bottle wasn't sealed.I carefully read and followed the instructions to the letter. The tanning solution is not a bronzer, which makes it difficult to tell if you have applied it evenly. It took overnight for the tan to develop - and what a disappointment! I ended up with a very streaky tan as well as drip marks in a couple places. Determined to try to it again, I had my husband carefully apply the solution again. The results ended up being not much better than the first application. I gave it a final try a few days later, but again, it seems impossible to get any even tan - now I've been waiting/exfoliating for a week trying to get rid of what's left of this bad fake tan.The solution does give a decent color tan, but I'll stick with other products or the salon before I ever try using this device again."
1,Couldn't even use it!,I bought the IBOD Airbrush Tanning system. When I got the item and went to use it i found out that a special plug in (230 Volt) was needed. I dont know if I was missing a part with this package or what was going on because the instruction said use a standard outlet but it didn't work. I never got to use the product but if anyone wants to buy it for personal use make sure you BUY the IBOD PERSONAL AIRBRUSH TANNING SYSTEM. That one clearly says you can use a 110 volt outlet which is standard.
5,Best cookbook for busy moms,I went through two of these cookbooks when my children were small. The recipes are easy and quick along with being nutritious. I think it's out-of-print but was glad to get a copy for my daughter who has a small child now.
2,Size? What size?,What does it mean we don't have specific size chart for this product? R U kidding?How is one to know if ordering the right size? Is a 5 kids or an adult? Hello!
3,Ok Book,"The book itself is only so-so I feel. I have taken two classes with Dr. Iskander and he uses it as a reference, and does point out where the errors are. The classes I find were/are great, he clearly knows and loves the material. The book though does not as clearly explain the principles as others I have come across."
1,iskander,"We used this book in our electromagnetics class at UT Austin. I did not like this book at all. It did not clearly explain many concepts. Further there were many errors in the book, for example, in the sample problems. The result was that you were never sure if you didn't understand what was being explained or if in fact the book was just plain wrong. This is not a good book for learning electromagnetics."
4,Make sure you know the EDITION,"A lot of vendors sell old books without mentioning the Edition. Have the correct ISBN number, or confirm ahead of time before you purchase.This company sent me what they said they would, but it was wrong for me."
1,This books sucks,"This books sucks ballz. It contains many mistakes, it has very poor explanations, few examples, and huge leaps from one step to the next in the solutions. It's totally worthless as a textbook and may be marginally useful as a reference. I purchased two other well-respected books on electromagnetism to replace this doorstop. Hopefully they'll arrive in time for my grades to turn around."
3,like the book? try dealing with the author,I think that the book was alright but only because the author was teaching the course. The man is insane to be sure. Some of the lost details were filled in by his lecture while others were left as an exercise. I wish that I never had seen this book or taken this course.
1,a waste of time,"This is compilation of stories about crowd behavior, amusing at times, but with little or no insight, except that you should not panic. Everybody already knows that and besides it is not always true. In a stock market crash it is better to panic sooner rather than later. Also, I recall that a number of people in the WTC horror died because they decided to stay put in their offices rather than to rush down. But what I really don't like at all about this book is that it is marketed as a book for investors. This is nonsense. It is a book of stories about crowd behavior with no analysis except, as noted, the completely one-sided recommendation that you should not go along with the crowd."
2,Disappointment,"Amazon offered Menschel's book at a combination price with Taleb's Fooled by Randomness. Mistakenly, I expected both to provide stock market guidance. Taleb's book had little and Menschel's has less."
5,Jordi Savall - Need I Say More?,"Everything Jordi Savall touches seems bright, new and sparkling with elan vital. I never thought I could bear hearing Eine Kleine Nachtmusik again. This recording makes it fresh and glowing. This was listed as one of the best of last year's issues in the New York Times, and it is clear why."
2,So So,"This small, easily portable level is six sided and the fluid inside is thick enough to dampen the movement of the bubble. It appears to be well made. However, there are inconsistencies which are really faults in the readings. One would think the bubble would come to rest in the same position no matter which of the six sides is on the edge to be examined, but that is not the case! Also, when used to level artwork the bubble cannot be easily seen when it is on the up side because the glass tube is recessed, almost out of sight. Unfortunately, I can not recommend this level due to its poor visibility and inconsistent readings."
1,A good primer,"As for the seller he gave awesome service quick response, good packaging -- i definetly would buy from him again-- but alas not this book... the original comes in 2 massive volumes -- this was kind of an intro to the subject. The book title is a misnomener -- apparently some industrious body has taken random pages from the 2 volumes and printed them as a single volume, a lot of the enrtries stop at the end of a page and are not continued -- this was money i wish I hadn't spent -- i don't recommend this book... Encyclopedia of freemasonry by Albert Gallatin Mackey the real one apparently is offerred..."
1,Kindle version for Blackberry is cumbersome!,I'm sure that the reference is incredible!Would love to own the hardcover!Sorry I wasted my money on the Kindle version for my Blackberry though!I knew it would be small and tough to read on Blackberry but thought that it would at least be a helpful search-reference; WRONG!No helpful index. No integral word search! Only PDF search and I haven't even figured out how to do that yet.Sure wish I had saved the money towards the purchase of a hardcover and done more research on whether or not the text was search-able!
4,"POWERFUL, SLEEK, EASY TO OPERATE, BUT....","This oven was purchased because of it's sleek looks and relatively small width. It is a 1,300 watt unit and shows it! It cooks VERY fast and quietly. The controls are very easy to learn and use. The owner's manual is complete and easy to read and understand. I have only TWO complaints. ONE: When opening and closing the door the oven sounds like a huge Cambell soup can. VERY hollow and echoing metal sound making it sould cheap. They did not use enough sound deadening material in the construction of the cover and door it appears. There is no way I could have known this befor purchase since this oven was not available in my city. TWO: There is NO LIGHT that comes on when the oven door is open! UNBELIEVABLE! The only light illuminates when the oven door is closed and the oven is working. What the designers were thinking I don't know. However, the features far outweigh the deficiencies and I'd buy it over again even if I DID know of these two problems."
4,Dialing for Dinners,"This is a beautiful microwave, if microwave ovens can be beautiful. It is very confusing to use at first. You need to follow the directions, but they're not that clear. If you think when you program at first, it soon becomes very easy. My husband had a difficult time adjusting to something out of the ordinary. I bought this for its power. No more having to run things through twice! I love my new microwave!"
1,Only if you want to do maintenance,"Mine went to the shop 4 times in the first year. Unfortunately, the 5th time was after the first year meaning after the warranty expired. It's a big paperweight now since cost of repairs is more than value of microwave. STAY AWAY unless you think the value of trips to the repair shop and the right to buy a new microwave in a year justify the price."
1,"Save for the ""Breaking"" 15 days after Buying it...","15 days after buying this, I put a cup of water into it to warm it up to make some pizza dough. After 20 seconds of cooking, the microwave spontaneously shut off. So I repeated the process with the same results -- this time with a whiff of ozone. The third time the same thing happened.After reading about the explosions and other failures with this microwave, I am returning it sans calling Panasonic.And really this is too bad. From a design and features perspective, this is a very cool microwave. However the third factor in considering its worth is ""Does it work?"" That last question was a resounding NO. Pass on Panasonic."
1,Failure H98,"Product failed shortly after buying. Get about 10 seconds of power then H98 appears in screen and most of the buttons stopped working.INCREDIBLY difficult to get money back. No replacement/exchange available. Customer service is designed to only function (maybe) for the most persistant. Most people, like me, give up.Ended up throwing it away.Won't buy Panasonic again. Not because of a faulty product but rather lack of customer support. Companies need to realize that customers pay the bills and they need to be taken care of."
1,Worked fine for about 6 months,"This microwave worked fine for about 6 months, then quit. Warranty will repair it if I pay to ship it to an authorized repair center and then pay to ship it back. Not much value in that."
1,does not work,"This product did not work as promoted. In fact, the prism never did turn when it was hung in the sun so produced no rainbows.Very disappointing for our granddaughter."
4,kikkerland rainbow maker,I love the product s it sets my whole room on fire.It was quickly here.They are lovely presents to give for childrens bedrooms.
3,weak solar panel?,"I got the solar powered heart rainbow maker and was pretty excited. However, the solar panel was not working properly - I had to hold the panel outside my window every time I wanted it to spin and make rainbows?! I guess I will have to live with it - it makes beautiful rainbows and makes me feel at peace to see all the colors explode in my room... :)"
4,Really fun toy.,"My cat loves to chase rainbows and this item works great for that! The sun has to be pretty bright and direct for it to work - in this Northern winter light, sometimes it just doesn't make enough juice. However, over all, it's a great idea and works fine."
2,Rainbow maker,"This one must be in direct sunlight in order for the solar-powered motor to opeate. Many solar panels will operate in indirect light, but this one is nothing more than a non-functioning decoration unless you have a window in just the right place."
3,"Very pretty, but VERY overpriced","I somehow figured that I was getting something a little larger, with a certain build quality, for that much money.Personally I think it's overpriced. I mean, yeah, it's solar, yeah, it moves. But the rainbows it throws are about two-inches long. For that price, I'd assume that I could change the speed of rotation if I wanted. Also, there are no hooks for hanging, like the other reviewer said. It feels delicate in my hands, so I hope when it drops (it's always a ""when"", not an ""if"", with those suction cups), I hope it won't break or chip."
2,Claims to come with hanging hooks but doesn't,I'm not sure whether to return this product or not; it cost a pretty penny given how simple a mechanism it is--especially when it doesn't come with hanging hooks (in case the suction cup does not work) as it claims. Got some sunlight today (we live in upstate NY!) so I know it works but it doesn't seem to produce much in the way of little rainbows--also as it claims.
5,Rainbow Maker,Both items were used for gifts for our hosts when wetraveled to Finland. They put them in their windowsimmediately. We also have one of these and have giventhem as gifts. A wonderful gift enjoyed by all.
4,SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO SYD BARRETT?!,"Certainly a vanity project if there ever was one, but quite listenable all the same. In the late 60's and early 70's this might have passed for a near-death experience. As it is, here in the 21st Century, it all a bit schizoid, man. But a lot of fun. Hopefully, Wilson had his tongue in cheek. Some passages soar beautifully in pre-Dark Side Pink Floyd mode. This could almost have been titled ""Son of Meddle."" Anyway, you'll never consider YES's TALES excessive again. Now on to DEADWING...."
2,The strangest Porcupine Tree CD,"I really love this band, however this CD just does not do it for me.The annoying voice overs are just that very annoying.There is no vocals, the music is good but has no real direction.I can't really listen to this."
4,Experimental and spacey!,"I found "" Voyage 34"" to be an album nice to listen to when you want ambient music in the area. Not an album to sample Porcupine Tree's deverse talents from.The second and third tracks are trance themes. As nice a melody as they are they get to be redundant over the lenth of time. Being a fan of PT's music today it was nice to hear the musical genesis of their early stuff compared to the different style and sound they have today."
4,Voyage 34 - Amazing,"wow. ive been diving into the PT back catalogue for the last couple of months, and this was the album i was looking forward to immenseley. all i can say is i havent been let down at all!!!from start to finish, its pure gold and definitely a trip worth taking many times. there is not a dull moment anywhere, the solo at the end of phase I is one of the most pleasant moments ive heard.i couldnt have asked for anything better than this, its in my top 3 PT albums for sure - if not the best. i suppose its mostly aimed at people into the ambient type of music but i imagined it to just be Robert Fripp type soundscapping which wouldnt have been a problem, but it contains alot of the style of music contained in The Sky Moves Sideways. its really rocking at parts too.yea so i gave it 4 stars, not sure why i didnt give it 5 but its possibly worthy of it."
4,Interesting piece of work,"I love Porcupine Tree. I find their music stimulating and unique. I own quite a bit of their stuff. This album is very interesting and it gets four stars for creativity and some nice guitar work.Having said that, unless you are a rabid collector of PT works, you may want to purchase the Stars Die compilation as the 12 minute mix on it is more or less the highlight of this album (the mix on Stars Die is a modified version of Voyage 1). I often find myself admiring the Stars Die mix, but I will rarely stick this entire cd in my stereo. However, if you want to purchase it to support the band (lord knows that too many horrible ""artists"" are supported these days), you can't go wrong either, as this cd can be obtained for a reasonable price."
5,We love Arnold !,"You can't go wrong with this purchase ! I was very popular with my family when they received this DVD set as a gift from me. I have 2 teenagers and a husband who have been waiting for the release of ""Hey Arnold"" on DVD for years. Be prepared to invest in the entire series once you watch this one."
5,Incredible,This dvd was way better than I expected. The video quality was great and the sound quality was amazing! If you are a die hard or just regular HA! fan i highly recommend buying this dvd!
2,"Good DVD, but horrible quality.","You have no idea how excited I was to get this DVD. I watched it and within the first half hour I noticed something. The DVD SKIPS! Now I only figured this out but I can't be wrong when I noticed when Doug season 1 and Hey Arnold season 1 both have this problem. During flashes of light(lightning) the DVD will skip for a second or too.Least to say I was outraged. It was due to several factors. The delayed shipment, the price of the DVD, and me finding out the DVD skips and made me wonder about the craftmanship. Now, this would not be a problem if I got my order on time OR that the price was significantly lower. If I am only the person with this problem, then the product I received was low in quality. But if anyone else does not have this lightning problem, then buy it!"
1,DVD Won't Play,I bought this product as a Christmas gift. We tried playing it in all of the DVD players in our house and even on our new computers. It would not play on anything. I even returned the DVD for a replacement and it still won't play. This has been very frustrating and a huge waste of time.
5,finally the Hey Arnold Christmas Special on DVD,"My whole family loved the Hey Arnold show when it was on TV and for many years, around December, I would look for a DVD copy of the Hey Arnold Christmas Special as it is a family favorite Christmas show. It was never available until I found this DVD collection of the first season from Shout! Factory. It contains all the first season episodes and the Christmas Special and Valentines Day Special as well. Everyone enjoyed watching the original shows like Stoop Kid, The Vacant Lot, Operation Ruthless and Pigeon Man. At only $15.99, when I purchased it, it was a steal to finally have a permanent DVD copy of one of the finest Christmas shows made. Thanks Amazon and Shout! Factory."
5,Five Stars For Hey Arnold!,"I was a big fan of this show in elementary school growing up in the mid to late 90's from the time it was first previewed as ""Arnold"" during Harriet The Spy to it's own movie 6 years later. This DVD let's you relive all of your favorite memories of the iconic first season on Nickelodeon from the fall of 96. On this DVD the animation and music of Hillwood are brought to life once again. Hey Arnold! is a city life of solving problems with sometimes crazy circumstances all seen through a late childhood perspective.Special features like an audio commentary or behind the scenes look at the show would have been nice but I still give Season 1 five stars for being so genuinely awesome.PS. The Shout release DVD plays the episodes in production order rather than the order they aired on TV. It also has higher quality, a nice letterbox picture but nothing to stare at in awe like Hey Arnold HD."
2,Great idea...just didn't play!,"I bought this for my brother for his birthday and he was very excited to watch it. However, when played in the DVD player it only advanced to the main menu...wouldn't play the actual episodes. Maybe it is formatted for a specific type of player...just be careful of this before ordering!"
3,Space Dogs,"Interesting story about US space program in the early, pre-human days. A must read for space enthusiasts."
5,Bodywork from a book?,"It's usually very challenging to learn therapeutic bodywork from a book, but Osborne-Sheets does an exceptional job of teaching her deep tissue technique in words and photographs. She doesn't limit her instruction to the strokes but addresses the therapist's use of his/her entire body in order to apply force effectively and safely. This isn't a book for casual reading -- it's clearly meant for professional bodyworkers who want to understand the science behind their techniques and who strive for excellence in application."
5,deep tissue sculpting,this book is wonderfully illustrated and written in a lanquage easy to follow and understand...a great book for the library of any body work therapist...
4,"Yes, Morelli portrays a terrible detective but he's likable","I like the Inspector Colliandro shows because they are entertaining even though Giampaolo Morelli portrays a crude, day-dreaming detective who nearly always gets the wrong answer. Ignore the profanity and you will find it likable. The plots are very good and most of the acting is worth watching."
3,"Good, but nowhere near ""Labyrinth of Evil""","This was a great series and lead-in for Episode III, but if you really want the whole truth of what happened before Revenge of the Sith, then I suggest you read ""Labyrinth of Evil"". The book gives a deeper storyline, and makes things much more clearer. (Also, Grevious does not get his hacking cough from Mace Windu, that is simply a side affect of his medical operation.)"
2,mace windu is MAGNETO!!!!,"I love star wars but I don't know what to think about this cartoon version. The animation looks cheap and the characters look disfigured. The story is just constantly action packed jumping back and forth from battle to battle. I do not like mace windu in this one in where he punches droids into scrap metal and can defeat thousands of them with the wave of his hand. Imagine in Episode 2 when the Jedi are surrounded by droids at the stadium. In the cartoon mace would have just closed his fist and crushed the droids, it was like he was magneto. The story jumps way off with Anakin trying to save some primitive race from being converted to a new weapon used by grievous. He saves them at the end but I didn't get why the writers would even add such a long story to something that seem pointless."
3,"Great for kids, not too violet","The new Clone Wars on CN is great, its awesome, but its not for kids, this is a little more friendly and not so adult. No extreme death or adult situations. The animations moreless Samari Jack, which is an awesome cartoon. The 1st season is better than the 2nd, which kind of when to wacked out on the whole leech drawing on Anikan at the Tribe temple. This is more standard Star Wars."
5,Awesome,My family loves these dvds. The storytelling is great and much better than the live action movies. These movies did a better job of telling a Star Wars story. We have watched them many times and see something new and exciting every time.
5,Star Wars,"I liked this series more than the prequels. It had great Jedi action, sometimes just short enough. Other times it extended an episode to tell a stronger story.I watched this within a 3 day Star Wars marathon and found it to be just as satisfying as the other movies. :)"
5,Puts things together nicely,"My son (7) is a huge Star Wars fan, so I would have gotten this for him anyway. Adding that it helps piece together what happens between Episode 2 and 3 is an added bonus.Well done!"
4,Star Wars Clone Wars Vol 2,"Very creative, it is a must have, along with volume 1, for all star wars fans."
5,"Do or do not, there is no try",Exceeded my expectations. Arrived weeks before promised. Quality of disc was almost new. Recently watched it with my son. Impressive. Most impressive.
3,Underappreciated,"Although I haven't received this in the mail yet I have of course seen it and have a certain level of respect for the way it was done. I hope the current SW TV series has more of a cross-over than I am expecting, probably none, because so far I feel the microseries covers much more exciting details, just not drawn very well IMO."
3,Just One Problem,"This is some sweet Star Wars action and I really enjoyed volume one but I read Labyrinth of Evil and this volume doesn't show what happened in that book very well. I was just trying to figure out why the heck the story wasn't the same, doesn't really make since. O well it is still pretty cool and will fit in nicely to complete my collection."
5,Another Great Star Wars episode,"Excellent! This series bridges the gap perfectly between the movies. After a while, you become so engrossed in the story, that you forget that it's animated. The voice actors also did a great job of replicating the movie actors' voices. I would definitely recommend this and I am eagerly awaiting a new rumored series."
3,Lots of Fun,"Star Wars--Clone Wars is a lot of fun to watch. The adventures of Obi Wan and Anakin and the other Jedi are great swashbuckling adventure. This installment, Volume 2, features longer episodes and achieves a flow of story which is superior to Volume 1 as a result, though both volumes are good. If you don't likne anime, you probably won't like this, as it was George Lucas' interest in anime that led to this series. Volume 2 chronicles the events which lead directly to the opening scene of Star Wars Episode 3--Revenge of the Sith, so if you always wondered how General Grievous got a hold of the Chancellor, all is revealed here."
2,Not too bad,"The acting was not very good in my opinion. There were a few times that I didn't quite see where things were going, but I am very big on endings. It may be hard to stay interested throughout the movie but at least it had a nice ending."
5,"Mr. Nobody is a true ""Go Getter"".Ready for the world!!!!!!!!","I found the album to be real.The young artist really put his heart into his work. I give shout outs to all of the artist that are featured on the album. Especially the ""Fallen Angels"". Check out songs like ""Lets Ride"",""Where Ya Heart At"". I would advise everyone who apprciates the art of realism to check this album out. So don't be a hater on that true valley click. Keep it real. Get down witt ""BIG BANK"" so we can get ""OUT OF CONTROL""."
2,Disappointing mixing,"Contrary to the previous review, I find that commenting on the quality of the mixing on this cd to be essential. It has to be the sloppiest 'exhibition' of professional mixing that I've heard consigned to disc. It just sounded like there was too much emphasis on getting as many tracks on in 70 mins, regardless of flow, or beat matching. Very let down by this disc."
2,Losing it...,The only thing that saves this mix is the fact that there are some really nice tracks on it. Other than that... This is some of the sloppiest mixing I've ever heard on a commercial CD. Some of the mixes are such out-and-out disasters that I find it unlistenable. And those that he does pull off are nothing jaw-dropping (what always made me excuse his sloppiness in the past). Big disappointment.
3,Standard ASV-Living Era release,"ASV-Living Era has put together a collection of Ben Selvin recordings that feature big-name singers and well-known songs. There are many good things here not otherwise available on CD, such as a bouncy 1920's rendition of 'Manhattan' that is completely different than the smoother version popularized by later generations. But fair warning: ASV's engineers lay on the noise reduction with a very heavy hand. I guess the idea is to eliminate surface noise from the 78's, but wiping off the high frequencies results in muddy sounding disc. I would suggest this disc as an inexpensive overview, but if you are sure you like this music, consider the Ben Selvin collections released by the Old Masters label (also here on Amazon). They cost more, but the remastering is top-notch. Cheers."
2,Disappointing,This CD seems to me to be rather dull and lack luster in nature. Disappointing. The playing doesn't seem to reflect the nature and excitement of the times.
2,Give it a miss,"Used to have to sit through this as a child. Don't get me wrong, I adore English comedy, but, although this has all the hallmarks, it is nowhere near the top of the pile, and given the vast amount of excellent English stuff to choose from, you should give this a miss.The only exception to this would be if you are English and served in the Far East during WW2. You would then probably find it enjoyable, if only because familiar."
3,Only lasted 3 years,"I had hoped for many more years of microwave use, but 3 years was all I got. The door latch broke and then I learned that an important door latch sensor was burnt out. Three stars is all it gets due to the short lifespan. On the plus side, it was a great microwave during its life, heated well and was relatively quiet."
4,Super Fast,"I love this microwave. My previous microwave was also a Panasonic and it lasted 10 years. Just like my last one, it's easy to use, but a lot powerful at 1300W; it cooks everything super fast.The only thing I don't like about it is that even with a microwave cover over the food, you have to use an oven mitt to get your food because so much steam is released. Also preferred my previous microwave's turntable because it didn't have wheels and don't understand why this microwave has them."
1,Crap,"This Microwave is the Worst Ever. Here is why. I received it in my home, shipped from Amazon on May 8th, 2007, Yesterday on July 26, 2007, IT DIED! I paid, $129. Anyway, I call Amazon, and they SUCK! 30 days is all they cover, after that YOU are on your OWN. I don't know what has happened to them, I am not going to use them anymore. Not to mention the guy in Customer Service couldn't speak English and Understand me. NOT his fault, but frusterating all the same. I know they could care less if I shop with them or not, obviously due to the way I was treated. Anyway, It worked Awesome for 3 short months. What ever you do, if you must purchase this item, don't buy it from amazon, as they don't back what they sell for more than 30 days. Good Luck to you All."
3,More power than it can stand,"Great unit with the highest wattage in a microwave of this size. 5 stars.However, after five months use we need warranty service. Tried to call Panasonic and the recorded voice said they were closed that Sunday even though the service hours the recording gave included the time when we called. Tried to use their online e-mail service request. It was designed to be interactive with additional entry boxes that appeared depending on your prior input. The response during this interaction was slow even on a DSL line on a Sunday. After we finished input, it would not send any of our tediously entered information. We tried on two different computers without success. One star."
4,Aw C'mon It's Pretty Good!,I pretty much disagree with the negative sentiment of the reviewers for this disk. Is it Laura Nyro's best? No. But the flow of song to song is gentle. It's a great dinner lp. Light some candles and enjoy some intimacy. This disk will calm you and make you miss her.
1,Lost Her Talent,This CD is terrible. Listening to it makes me very sad because Nyro was one of the brightest talents around when she first started out. Stick with her early albums or her greatest hits. This album consists of poor remakes and lousy new songs which don't come close to her best.
5,Gran disco de los sesanta,"Gran disco que refleja la epoca, los ritmos y la variedad de lo que se hac√≠a en la epoca. Un disco imperdible para los amantes de la m√∫sica en todas sus variedades. Temas con esp√≠ritu, con ganas, y con total convicci√≥n.El ritmo me ronda la cabeza con solo acordarme de cada uno de las canciones que aparecen en el disco.Havens y compa√±ia ya nos hac√≠an vibrar con sus compases."
4,Great Reference Guide,"I'm a metallurgical engineer at a major steel company, and this is a great guide and reference to have in my little library."
3,Great pictures; not for picky eaters,"This book is fun for me and the girls to just look at, but my 4 year olds will only eat the simplest items from it even if the finished dish is fun/interesting looking. I do like the chapters on nutrition and meal planning. I'm glad I bought it, but I seldom use it."
2,Ayurveda Dumbed Down,"I purchased this book on the strength of other consumer's reviews, but was disappointed by how simplistic it is. Ayurvedic medicine is a life-long study, not a ""handbook"" for looking up routine symptoms. It may be an introduction to this ancient form of healing, but the book really can't help anyone get an over-all picture of their state of health, or give good advice on how to treat yourself. This book is just an example of the Western approach: why see a real, trained practitioner when you can save money and fix yourself? Only you can't--at least not with this book. Save your money and go see an Ayurvedic Physician and be properly diagnosed and treated."
1,The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies,"Dr. Lad is one of the foremost authorities on Ayurveda in the world. This book has many natural recipes for managing health. In a world where we are steadily being programmed to believe that we cannot survive without genetically modified irradiated processed ""food"" and the drugs to ""cure"" the diseases this crap forces on us Dr. Lad's vast storehouse of knowledge is a miracle.I look forward to studying with him at the Kripalu School of Ayurveda!"
2,Book,"Not as described by seller. There was not just a mark on cover, but writing inside on the pages as well."
4,Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies,It is an easy way to get familiar with an alternative health choice. Most things are readily available in your own home and do not have a page of side effects. A great place to start to cure oneself.
2,Incomplete and comes with too many caveats,Being new to ayurveda this book does not seem v helpful because everywhere it makes it v clear that all treatments are based on your identification of your dosha type which the book maintains is difficult and needs to be done by a ayurvedic practioner. Had I known that before I would not have purchased the book.
5,What's not to like?,Modern medicine treats symtoms.....not the cause of illness. This book has real remedies for illness.
5,Can't find my old copy--so it is time to buy a new one!,"Simply a must have for anybody over the age of 15. I cannot remember the names of a lot of my college courses, but I do remember Issues of Morality in American Society. Why? Because this book was the only required reading in the course. Most of the class members ate it up--and you should too!"
3,"It's not bad, more or less a PG-13 type of anime story.","I agree with the other reviewers that the animation could have been better, but it is better than some other cartoons on cable. Having some background in FFV does help. However, it is not required. In a way, it reminds me of a Disney cartoon with humor, a simple plot, and ok animation. Renting and viewing before buying the video is very wise. That's all I have to write about before I go on and pass the 1000 word limit."
1,What am I looking for.. .??? P.U.,"This anime was a TOTAL waste of time. It was poor anime, hardly followed the line of ANY of the FF games (I really don't care what anybody else says, it has nothing to do, hardly, with FF5. I'm a HUGE HUGE HUGE anime/FF/RPG fan, and this is completely not worth your time) and if all that wasn't enough, the characters are all made out to be STUPID. Parents: This would be a good show to get your tykes brain-dead on."
4,This is a great anime--especially if you've played the game.,"After completing the Super Nintendo game ""Final Fantasy V"", it is very refreshing to have a follow-up, and it makes the movie seem very good. It has a very interesting story and the voice-acting is very well done. The picture quality isn't top-notch, but the animation is well done. The only real problem with this movie is that if you haven't completed the game, then it won't make much sense."
3,"PRETTY GOOD, PRETTY GOOD.","Whats with everybody else, Ok so this anime doesn't fallow the story of any FF game, SO WHAT? Its still a good anime and the animation is fine. Regardless of what other peple say, I think its worth seeing."
1,"P U, what a stinker!!!!!!","When I rented Final Fantasy vol. 1 I was expecting something like Akira or Ninja Scroll, what I got was something a million times worse. I found the characters in the movie to be way too goofy and the plot wasn't that great either. I've heard that you have to play FF5 to really get the story but I don't think it would of changed my perspective.The movie was a disgrace to the Final Fantasy title."
1,boo boo boo! Cheap rip-off of the FF name,"The animation isn't even that great. One of the many videos that's worth renting if you're a fan like me, but if you buy it you'll never watch it again. Big waste of third world artist's labor!!!!!!!!"
1,What was Square thinking at the time?!?,"Ladies and gentlemen, presenting Final Fantasy's ""Star Wars Holiday Special.""Pseudo-sequel to Final Fantasy 5? Give me a break. Horrible dialouge, loopy characters, awful jokes, deplorable voice acting, and don't get me started on the blinking butt scene. If I knew that this video would be the result of completing FF5, I would've let X-Death and Gilgamesh defeat me. Or I would fall on my sword. Either way, stay far away from this video! I haven't seen Volume 2, but judging from this, I'll keep some of my sanity!Granted, even an esteemed developer like Square (who co-produced this ""feature"") is entitled one flop in their lives. But save your money and go play the games instead.But The Spirits Within, that's non-game Final Fantasy done *right*."
1,The Flop of Entertainment,This video was a flop. It was too much like some kid Anime. I really didn't like it.
2,"Good in itself, but a waste of money to buy","As a movie in itself, it's okay, but it barely follows the plot of the game if at all. After watching this, I felt that I wouldn't want to watch it again and I wished I had rented it instead of buying it. The first video is better than the second, but you need to watch them both. If you want to watch this, I suggest you rent it instead of buying it."
1,This movie stinks!,This movie is awful. No story to speak of. Just stupidity galore and fanservice. This movie has nothing to offer as an action or fantasy story. Don't waste your money.
2,The best anime has to offer!,This movie sucked. It has every anime cliche in the book. Panty shots galore. Overt and overly done Sexual references. Fantasy themes that can be summed up in most other animes you see. Only thing missing is the lecherous old man. Humor that is flat and juvenile. This show would fair better as a parody of anime rather than Final Fantasy.The girl and her friend Pretz are commonly mistaken for one another in this anime many times. Don't waste your time.
3,"Not very good, but interesting if you play console RPG's","If you have ever played a final fantasy game or similar games, you'll recognize the RPG elements in the story. Which I thought was very nice. However, on it's own, the animation is average, and the story lacks detail."
3,an okay show,personlly this product had only two downsides1. it should get reralesd on DVD put togerther vol 1 and vol 2 i mean cmon square really2. if it gets reralesd make the chocobo yellow or gold not pink when i saw that i was like wtf cmon now other than that it would be goodgood sides1. shows what final fantasy really is swords magic guns airships and chocbos2. i would recmond this off of ebay and find the dvd verson where there put together for moneys worth3.it is final fantasy. spirits within isnt.
5,You have to give your heart to Lavyrle Spencer.,"Be prepared to have your heart broken and knit together again with love. Ms. Spencer touches your very soul with emotion.....joy, sorrow, laughter and most of all-love. These stories will become a part of your heart!"
5,An intriguing but difficult book,"I just finished this book, but heard about it about 20 years ago when the author appeared on BookTV, describing his ""Hitler of History"".Lukacz is a self-proclaimed ""reactionary"", pining for the values of days gone past. This book, describing his native city at the turn of the 20th century seems to be an attempt to describe the values he has in mind.To my reading those values are: free markets, tolerance, repect for high forms of literature and art, and rule by law.Lukacz is now in very advanced age. Whether or not he will live to see such a society is presently quite up in the air.Maybe the outcome of politics and culture in the next few years will tell. In the meantime, we can only be impressed with this author's vast knowledge of history, architecture, literature, art and the thorough mastery of his adopted language, English, which he's obviously added to his Hungarian, German, French, etc."
4,A brilliantly worded and vivid portrail of Budapest.,"The book was nothing short of a masterpiece. . . Informative, colorful and bursting with a bizarre kind of historical tension. I cried on several occasions whilst reading the book, yet could not put it down, even for a cup of my mothers hot chocolate made with almonds and fresh dark cherries - with dash of Granpa's home made rum."
3,A Good Read Most of the Time,"Having spent a summer in Budapest as a student, I was particularly interested in its history after my return. This book really fills in many of the details about the city that I never knew when living there. It's full of factiod information on population, language, architecture, etc. The problem with it; however, is that it doesn't effectively integrate these topics and treats them as rather separate phenomena (which of course they aren't). Still, it's the best history of Budapest that I've found and that's commendable."
4,A window to my grandfather's world,My grandfather was born in Hungary just after 1900 (I was born and raised in the US) - I found the book to be a real insight into the character of the people and times. It tied together many of the stories I had heard and shed light on a culture that was a large part of him. The writing is sometimes a little dry - but it is worth persevering.
4,When Budapest was king....,"For a brief interlude at the turn of the century, Budapest was physically and culturally the fastest growing city in Europe. In a style which is informative without being pedantic, the author creates the city as protagonist, reacting to the historical and personal forces which it confronts. Highly recommended..."
4,"A stylist, especially in his footnotes!",Lukacs attempts to capture the mental climate of Budapest 1900. This is a kind of impressionistic approach to history that uses scholarship to achieve its effects. He is definitely worth reading.
4,nice book on magickal gardening,"My parents recently moved into a house on a small plot of land, a bit of a garden in front and some in back. What I wanted to find, and am still looking for, is a book to help me magically protect the house and its dwellers by using plants and plant magic, as well as to boost prosperity, blessings, hapiness and health of people living on the land. Although this book covers garden as sacred space and theme gardening (elemental garden, medicinal, seasonal garden), as well as plants for magic and lunar gardening, it does not help with my primary gardening objective."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book with the hope hat it would be about designing and planting a garden that would not only be a place to sit and enjoy, but also serve a useful purpose as well.Unfortunately, it does neither. This book has very little of value in regards to anything to do with gardening. If you are someone who is already into doing witchcraft as part of your pagan religion, then you should already know everything that's covered in this book. I didn't pay full price for this book, and I still felt gipped. You would be better off buying books on herbs and plants that are useful, and on garden design, than this one."
4,this book is good,i like this book it's very informative. the only reason i give it 4 stars is because i think the author could have done a little more. but kudos all the same.
1,Not a very good product,"The first watch I received did not work at all; the second watch runs fast, I really thought Seiko made a better product. Maybe it really isn't a Seiko!"
2,Doesn't keep time,"I had a crystal SEIKO before this one that kept time to the second. This watch gained about a minute a week. Love its durability and looks, but worthless. Gave mine away."
1,I can't believe these reviews,"The reviews on this watch are unbelievable. I guess there are a lot of Seiko employees. This watch keeps horrible time. I want to send it back for repair but Seiko says that + or - 20 seconds a day is normal! I have had other automatics and this is unacceptable. Mine is fast by 30 seconds a day! Do the math after a month you will be ahead 15 minutes! 10 minutes a month is apparently acceptable to Seiko. Not me, don't buy."
3,"Nice watch, just stops if not worn","I bought this watch for my husband, and he's been happy with everything about it except for the fact that it will stop running if you don't wear it often enough. Since he switches watches, he sometimes doesn't wear it for a few days and has to re-set it. Had I known this, I probably would've bought a model that you don't have to wear to keep running, but other than that, it's well built and he seems to like the face size, band, etc. If you will only be wearing this watch, you should be fine."
1,Stopped Working within 24 hours of Arrival,I ordered this watch and it stopped working within 24 hours of arriving. I never even took it out of the box. I am returning it. Very unhappy with this purchase.
5,Excellent Dive Watch,"The quality is excellent for the price, and Amazon had the best price. Stores typically charge in excess of $100 more for the same watch. This model is very rugged, and will withstand rough treatment very well."
2,"Poor time keeper, but durable.","I purchased a SKX173 about six years ago and was initially impressed by the weight and build quality of the watch. Over the last couple years, I have grown tired of its inability to keep accurate time. The watch is consistently about 10 minutes fast after about a week of operation. I am looking for a new watch this holiday and would advise others this is not a good watch and to look elsewhere for another make or model.Pros :+ Durable and has held up against the elements+ Comfortable and Attractive+ Reasonable costCons :---- Inaccurate ; 10 minutes fast after about a week- Wristband quality (even with Seiko branded replacements) is poor"
5,I love it,"This is gonna be short and sweet and not all flowery, but I bought this watch and love it. I wasnt sure whether or not to get something without seeing it in person, but I'm glad I did. Its sorta big, but not massive or anything. The silver and black looks so cool too. I was initially worried about the watchband being rubber and looking cheap, but it doesnt at all. It looks good believe it or not. I've also got some condition where if I have metal against my skin thats not surgical stainless steel or some other pure metal I'll break out into ugly green blisters. I'm happy to report nothing so far. It must be the royalty in my blood that keeps me from wearing cheap jewelry... Uh anyways, this watch is even better looking in person and its a great price. I highly recommend it.scott."
1,Will not last much...,"This will be a great dive watch... while it lasts. After a year the band broke, this was no big deal and was expected being plastic and wearing it everyday (replacement was around $15 here at amazon). The problem was around 2 years later when the watch din't hold a charge, if you shaked the watch it would start to run but stop after a few seconds."
1,Not that reliable.,"I love the looks of the watch, the automatic movement is not that good, thewatch stops working while you're wearing it."
2,Not up to Seiko standards,"I've had good look with Seiko watches and expected the same with this ""divers"" watch. While I like the look, weight and durability of the exterior, unfortunately the movement inside just leaves you wondering if Seiko didn't just outsource this to some Malaysian company and forget about it. Since day one the watch has always run fast, gaining 5-7 minutes a day. Within the first year, the self winding mechanism began losing its efficiency. Now if I don't take the time each day to remove the watch and shake it for several minutes, it will stop overnight. Also, the band is fairly uncomfortable and stiff, but that is really a more personal assessment and others may feel differently. My suggestion is if you are looking for a sports watch with the perceived reliability and quality of a Seiko, you need to keep looking past this timepiece. It just shouldn't carry the Seiko name."
2,It Won't Last,The band broke after 1 year. The multifunction set stem broke after 2 years. Pretty darn poor for a $300 watch.
2,Halfway decent watch but poor poor customer service,"I've owned this type of Seiko Divers watch for over 16 years. It's held up quite well. However, it has NEVER kept accurate time. Within a week it will be 5 to 7 minutes fast. And after several letters and emails to Seiko, they have NEVER replied. No doubt the majority are quality watches, but I got the lemon and no customer service."
1,Garbage...,"This watch has never kept accurate time. It lost a minute or two a day, which quicks adds up enough lost time to make the watch essentially worthless. ""Too bad"" said Seiko, ""the watch is an automatic and won't ever keep very accurate time"". As if that weren't bad enough, the watch completely stopped running after about a year. I sent the watch to Coserv, the Seiko authorized watch repair facility in New Jersey, and for about $100 dollars they fixed my watch. Great! (Except I had to pay $100 to get a watch worth about twice that to work). Anyway, the watch was a gift so I paid to get it repaired and it ran great for about 3 maybe 4 months. Now, the watch is broken again. I'll send it back to Coserv, they do provide a one year warranty on their work, but this watch has obviously been a tremendous piece of crap."
4,Good watch but not great,"It is better looking in reality then in the pictures, but: it is not made in Japan, it is made in Malaysia, it goes about 7 seconds ahead each day. So if want the precise hour, minutes and seconds you won't be foully satisfied. Overall it is a good diver's watch."
5,Excellent timepiece,"OK, it does gain about 5 seconds a day, but that's not really the point. It's beautiful and iconic, I even like the black strap. At this price it definitely needed to be in my collection. After a few months I'll take it in to be regulated and it will be as perfect as an automatic can get. It has a real personality."
2,Wasn't Seiko Known for Accurate Time Keeping?,"I purchased this Seiko impressed by Seiko's reputation for smart style, rugged design and accurate time keeping. Well, two of the three proved true but keeping accurate time, what I consider the keystone function of any watch, is where this time piece fails. The watch was losing 10 minutes every two weeks.I sent it to Seiko for repair which tinkered with it and returned it with a note saying it's not design to keep accurate time. And since they worked on it, it now runs fast.Still, it's a beautiful watch and can take a pounding but so does a Timex at a quarter of the price."
2,Incredibly Disappointing,"This watch runs quite fast, and must constantly be adusted (which is not easy as you think). Also, the self-winding mechanism does not perform well, leading to even more adjustments. Unless you wear this watch for several hours a day, every day, it will wind down. It has essentially no reserve power, and you cannot manually wind it. I expected much more from Seiko."
2,Seiko Men's Automatic Dive Watch #SKX173,First of all its a great looking watch...but you should know it was made in Malaysia with Malaysia movement. The wrist band was made in China. Calibre #7S26-0028 engrave in the back. Is it me or do all SKX173 made in Malaysia??
2,Don't drop it!,"Unfortunately, this watch stopped working when I dropped it about 4 feet onto asphalt pavement. I liked the easy readability and utility of the rotating bezel. It kept decent time; nothing great. The failure after such a trivial knock would make me wary of relying on it. Users needing a reliable dive watch should choose something more substantial.BTW, I did not look into getting it fixed as I consider additional spending on the watch to be throwing good money after bad."
5,Rugged,"I've owned this model since I started diving in 1987. It tends to run +30 seconds per day now, at nearly twenty years old. Of course I've had to change the band a few times. Unlike many who buy dive watches, this was not only a daily wear watch, but also my only dive watch. My deepest dive with this watch was 110 feet, and it's never given me a problem. I just sent it in to Seiko for adjustment and a new crystal. I'm tempted to buy the yellow one as a back-up, and just because they're so cool. This is really the quintessential dive watch. Most divers can't afford a Rolex or Omega, and if they could, wouldn't risk banging it around on a real dive."
1,YOU CAN''T LIVE ON THE PAST,"All of these reviews are based on nostalgia, this was a great watch in the 80s but now is trash,i don't even think Seiko care about this anymore since young people don't used watches as they use to. If you want a mechanical buy an Orient diver, is a lot better than this Seiko diver. The past is gone, this is not what it used to be, be real."
2,to bad,"I would have loved this watch if it had been solar powered and this maybe asking a bit much, but also w/the perpetual calender would have made it a slam dunk.With the automatic you have to wear it all the time and if you have another watch, forget about waering it, unless you like constantly re-setting the thing."
1,Bad,This watch was a complete waste of money. It worked for a short period of time and quit. I sent it in for service and it did the same thing about a week later. I gave up. Don't waste your money.
1,keeps terrible time--runs fast,"I liked the look of this watch for years and finally broke down and bought one a year ago. Looks great but keeps TERRIBLE time. I just could not depend on it--10 minutes late to meetings, etc. I may have gotten a bad one but I would not buy another Seiko mechanical watch. I'm back to wearing my cheap quartz watch--at least I don't look at my watch and then immediately try to find another time source to compare it to."
4,Good Value,"A mechanical Movado watch looses or gains about a minute a day! For the price this watch is quite accurate! You need to wear it all the time. At night, if you set it at a night stand it could adjust itself a bit. Over all a mechanical accuracy is about 15 seconds a day +/- and based on how active you are? So, I give this watch thumbs up. For the design, this is a knock out. Very Attractive, and functional with a unique personality. If you are not diving all the time you may consider replacing the band. Good buy go for it. Also, I researched the 7S26 movement; it is basic when it comes to automatic watch mechanisms these days, but it is rugged."
5,I cant believe this watch has no Ratings,When I'm wanting to dress down but want a quality time piece...I take off my Omega and put this watch on...Japanese movement rivals that of swiss...I've owned this watch for ten years and It still looks new...If you are starting a collection and want some japanese pieces in it then this is a great place to start....it is a collectors Item.....buy with confidence!......
1,Disappointed,"I have had an early version of this watch for 17 years, and when it malfunctioned, I decided it was time to get a new one. The previous watch had been repaired 2 times earlier, and unfortunately every time I got it back from COSERV, it would be less and less accurate, thus I decide to get a new one. The new one was made in Maylasia vs Japan (I have read on this site that one needs to be concerned about that), and was lighter in weight, but kept time well for about one week. I bumped the watch on a table (nothing severe, the previous watch endured much more) and it immediately started gaining more than 10 minutes per hour. I had high hopes that this watch would at least meet, and hopely exceed the durability of the previous watch, but it did not make it passed one week of casual wear. I returned it in disappointment."
3,"Goodbye, Mr. Searcy","Terry knew the importance of this book as we talked about it many times. I even have an autographed copy. Unfortunately, Terry passed away in July of 2008 so while gone, he will not be forgotten."
3,I Still Love Leslie!,"I love golf and I love Leslie Nielsen. However, the writers for this one, with rare exception, seem not to love either. (I did not miss that Mr. Nielson himself was one of the writers...but he must have been practicing that great swing he has when the final script was prepared.) And Leslie, if you read this, I want you to know that I remember you as the Swamp Fox in the early days of Disney TV, love what you have done with your career, and ""surely"" wish you continued personal and professional success."
3,Its exactly as the title says,"I didnt expect much out of this when I purchased it. I really only got it 'cause I like the campy humour of Nielson. This little 50 minute golf video filmed at that Canadian Castle hotel place is not the funniest thing i've ever seen before, but it had a few good laughs as Leslie teaches you how to be a bad golfer. He gives you bizzare tips on how to hit, dice, slice and how to beat those overconfident players. As well as some bizzare tips you will look funny at the screen from and think, ""WTF?""It's in 2.0, runs for 50 minutes also has a biogrphay of Nielsn on it and some other thing to read that I skipped.IMO it should be a bonus feature on something else, but heck, for the price, it's ok on it's own for now I guess. It's ok, its not rip-roaring funny, but you should find a few laughs in it."
5,hardcore,i never thought that i would consider this movie one of the greatest I have ever seen. this movie didn't seem like much while i was watching it but there is no movie that has kept me laughing longer than this one. Every time I think of this retarded movie it cracks me up even more than before. I give it an A++++
1,Thumbs Down,When I saw this video it was one of the few videos ever that I returned to Blockbuster without watching it all AND I am a big fan of golf & other Leslie Nielson stuff...Need I say more...
1,For those entertained by peeling paint.,I could probably make you laugh harder by filming myself urinating on Leslie Nielson.
4,Stupid Little Golf vs. Spaceship (1981),"Many people forget that Mr. Neilsen started off with serious roles in the 60s and 70s then went for a change and starred in Spaceship, a hard-to-find, campy classic filmed right after Airplane.Also knows as Naked Space and The Creature Wasn't Nice, this video is probably only found in dark alley video stores, where THIS golf video should be...Too bad Spaceship (aka, aka) can't be more readily available,like on Amazon.com"
2,"ONLY 30 TARGETS, 30 NOT 120","ONLY 30 TARGETS!!!! FUNNY, They call them ""Style 120"", funny name for 30 targets, huh! Why, you might think they're trying to be DECEPTIVE! Bet they wrote the other ""Rave "" reviews too!"
5,A seriously good deal,"I bought the ink at Amazon for my printer after finding the ink I needed was not available from the local stores. I was happy to find it arrived quickly, was accurately depicted, and seems so far to be flawlessly applied. Thank you!"
4,Nice book for the coffeetable,Nice photos for a coffetable book. Just make sure you get the hardcover.
4,Nice Song,I think this song was a nice dance pop song. I like other 'NSYNC songs better such as It's Gonna Be Me and Tearin' Up My Heart but this is still a good song. Buy this if you like Bye Bye Bye but not the whole 'NSYNC cd. If otherwise buy 'NSYNC AND or OR No Strings Attached. The music video is cool too so I suggest you buy that instead of this if you want. 'NSYNC has talent and potential.
2,"um, yeah. ""bye""",I bought the single on a trip to Korea in March plainly because I wanted the backtrack to Bye Bye Bye which is included. But now that I don't need it I refuse to listen to the CD since Bye Bye Bye is so annoying and the third track Could It Be You sounds strangely familiar of a Vanilla Ice/NKOTB rehab festival.
1,"You can say that again, &#65533;N Stink!",Somebody ought to cut these guys' strings so they go bye bye bye once and for all. `Nuff said.
5,this song is pretty good.,you may notice that i put 5 stars. because... ...i am only grading bye bye bye. all their other songs are stupid and boring.only bye bye bye is good.and it is only particially good.
5,Best Pop Song of the Year!,"I saw the Bye Bye Bye MTV yesterday and immediately fall in love with the song. I think it is the best song I have heard for quite a while. It has a catchy lyrics and the dance steps are really cool. I particularly like the song ""No Strings Attached"" -- it really reflects the youth culture. I strongly recomend this song to pop lovers. By the way, this song is ranked No.1 in the Australian pop charts for 4 weeks already."
5,Can't put it down!,"Wow! I am not a big fan of N Sync, but I was really impressed when everyone was talking about Bye Bye Bye,so I got it on their new album, No Strings Attached. That's all i want to say to you peeps,so bye bye bye!"
3,Don't be fooled! This item is on backorder!,"Don't order this expecting to get it any time soon! Amazon doesn't tell you this, but it's on backorder. I ordered on March 20, and it's not expected to be delivered until the end of May. I am ticked, because it was supposed to be for my son's birthday in April. I'm trying to find it somewhere else online."
5,Stunning work,Deep and powerful work from a stellar musician. CD seems to be nowhere to be found (I found the tracks online). What a shame that If This is Hell isn't getting the accolades it deserves. Vastly more original and compelling than most popular music of the day.
2,Extraordinary Guidance : How to Connect With Your Spiritual,"I was hoping that this book would be more about connecting with your guides without using meditation which not everyone can do. I further was excited that she put her e-mail address on the back of the book and mentioned to send an e-mail, but so far I have not received any response."
1,such deception,"I was expecting a great book, and what I got was nothing like it. Too much emphasis on religion, not enough emphasis on meditation. The same content kept being repeated page after page, and the methods are presented in such simplistic fashion.If you are looking for a great book on the topic, try Ted Andrews'."
5,Best Instruction Ever!,"I have been working with my guides for 10 years and was looking for a book to help instruct friends and family members who also wanted to ""connect"". Of the many books I have read, Ms. Weimer's puts into plain language a clear, concise and easy to understand set of instructions for connecting to your guides. I highly recommend this book to anyone at any experience level as a great way to get in touch with your guides!"
4,Liza makes it simple...,"I'll be perfectly honest with you; I've achieved this elusive connection only a twice so far -my ""connections"" have a long way to grow! But this book takes so much of the stigma away and replaces it with some great common sense, some good tips, and enough faith to continue (even for the not-so-naturally-gifted, such as myself). I know now that it's simply a matter of practice and patience -You owe it to yourself to try this..."
2,Still awaiting the definitive work on the topic,"I am surprised by all the five-star reviews of this book. Turner managed to convince me that this is an important and underreported side of the war, but we must still await the definitive work on the subject. This simply isn't it. It is full of interesting anecdotes, but was peculiarly unhelpful for me in putting my lecture notes together. It relies mostly on interviews done in the mid-1990s, but beyond these interesting stories there is not much hard information here. (How many women were at Dien Bien Phu? Who knows?) Turner's interjection of herself as a ""character"" should have been edited out a long time ago."
2,True? Ghost Stories?,"This book is full of many stories, but lacks detail and credibility. Many of the stories seemed to based on a single episode experienced by only a handful of people (or in some cases young children)."
3,A nice collection of Ghosts,"This is a very detailed collection of this gendre, it is subdivided in USA States, each one of them has it's own legends on ghosts and this book collects them all, though i have to admit I had problems finishing it since many of these ghost stories become a little bit repetitive. It is a nice collection even if there are many similar to this world wide."
5,Haunted Heartland,"My Mother-in-Law bought me my first copy of this book for Christmas in 1987. I have always loved it, but we had a fire a few years ago, and it was damaged by water. I was very happy to find it again. One of the best books on true hauntings ever written, in my opinion. I have read it many times over the years, and i plan to read it many more. Excellent book!"
2,NEVER BUY A USED BOOK.,"The book had DUST MITES when it arrived, so I had to throw it away.It was bad enough that it was VERY VERY DUSTY and had an ODOR aboutit, but the DUST MITES were enough. I will NEVER BUY ANOTHER USED BOOK."
3,huntings,This book really shows how there are really hunting's that go on around and that there are many different aspects as to why this happens. This book I will have to say is one of the best I have read on the topic of hunting's and this I really liked. I still say that this really shows how different places are and the history behind the places.
1,Real crap,I bought two of these and BOTH fell apart after first usage. The glue that is supposed to keep the product together doesn't stick at all. Better buy something higher quality for a higher price because this is worth nothing.
2,Works fine if you know how to sew,"I was looking for a decent cheap armband, and this almost worked out. For the most part the armband works; the iPod fits snuggly and the band is fairly adjustable. However, within a week of using it, the small velcro circle used to secure then band to your arm popped right off. Apparently the glue is not very strong. I was able to sew it back on, but it was a pain. I don't think I would buy this product again."
4,Runner's Delight,"The adjustable armband, although not an apple product, works very well. It fits perfectly, holds the IPOD tight, and makes this runner and lifter very happy."
1,Not compatible with all X-Fi Cards - ZERO Documentation,"After doing a lot of research, and spending over an hour trying to connect this device to a new Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeGamer card, I discovered on Creative's knowledge base that these two devices are not compatible. However, Creative doesn't disclose this anywhere - but strangely the device is compatible with Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeGamer ""Pro"" card. Apparently, the non-Pro and non-X-Fi ""X-Fi"" cards only work with some strange mini optical digital-audio interconnect plug. This is simply the result of poor communication, zero documentation, and sloppy sales by Creative, Inc. If you're intending to use this device to connect an X-Fi card, check the newsgroups first because you probably won't get a straight answer from the product documentation or Creative's website. Overall, I was very disappointed with Creative, Inc. and this device is going back to Amazon."
3,"Works, but only for 2 speakers.","When using this cable to connect my Sound Blaster card to my new 5.1 surround sound system via the digital ports, it only sends the front left and front right information. The rest of the speakers are silent. If I use the analog outputs, I can get the 5.1 working fine. So, while my new speakers do work, so from that sense the cable works, it does not offer the same benefits as plugging up a sound card that has a digital output (my alienware laptop has a digital output and it works great for 5.1 surround via the same system).I'd recommend saving your money on this cable and putting it towards a new sound card that has a digital output built into the card."
2,"Works as advertised, but not entirely necessary...","I picked up this item since I use my PC as a lossless music server and use a outboard DAC for processing.Unless you need to use a optical connection, this item is not needed. Just go out and purchase a gold plated RCA to 1/8"" adapter and throw it on the end of your coax cable. You'll also be cleaning up the signal path."
2,Output works,"The unit lights up when addressed in the control panel, but the optical input does not work. Output is fine, but it is not the reason why I bought the unit. Tried everything I did to get an older dongle working on a SB Live (which still works in an older PC) but no results. It seems like Creative's drivers for the X-Fi are not up to the task yet, or they are clashing somehow with my system. The older dongle and SB Live combo was a pain to get to work, but in the end it did. Not the case with this unit. If you are buying to get optical output, go ahead, it works. If you are looking to record from any digital source, skip it."
5,Very useful,"Product works great, I'm using it to feed the audio from my PS3 into my computer using toslink. My only beef is that it should have been included with the soundcard to begin with."
1,What a waste,"I bought this thinking it would be surround sound with one optic cable right? No way on most of the low end cards, they only send 2 channels!"
2,Doesn't work with 5.1 surround sound system,"the good thing about it is it's cheap, I was gonna buy this for my extreme gamer fatal1ty to run optical to my z-5500 speakers but it only works with 2 channels the rest of the speakers are silent. I don't recommend it for people who are using surround sound system."
2,NOT for dolby system!,Creative labs X-FI series does NOT support dolby 5.1 on the digital out and their cards will NOT decode 5.1 on the digital IN.Why did I get this again?If all you need is a stereo in/out then this works fine.Who would buy a X-FI to do stereo.See my review of the Fatal1ty sound card for more detail.Documentation? We don't need none of *that* apparently!I am quickly losing faith in Creative Labs....This product is going back
5,Pipe out excellent digital audio,"If you have read the other reviews, you should already know that you must have the right sound card for this device to work. Compatibility info is available via creative labs' web site.Once I got everything hooked up, I was surprised that I couldn't get signal out of the digital output. I fuzzed with the setting on the computer to make sure digital output is turned on and checked all the wiring. Finally, I unplugged and plugged the device. It worked! The sound quality is excellent. My computer audio now comes out nice and clean from the amp!"
1,This does not deliver 5.1 sound with the X-fi extreme music.,I bought the Sound Blaster Digital I/o Module wanting to hook up my computer to my Sony STR-K740P 5.1 home theater system. The Sound Blaster Digital I/o Module will deliver a digital signal to external devices already decoded or it can be decoded from a home theater unit. Sadly I found that the best I could get with this product is a maximum of 2.1 audio. I found a few message boards with other people having many problems with this device so I would recommend that you save your money and get a sound card that has a digital coax or optical connection built in.
5,If you liked Kojiki...,"...then you'll probably like this album. I agree with the previous reviewer, this is closer to Kitaro's 80's albums. I'm glad of it since his 80's period is my personal favorite.The first track reminds me of the dramatic and then elegant opening of Kojiki. Kitaro's main talent lies in making dramatic music that is not over the top and romantic music the is not syrupy. Some of the faster tracks reminded me of the Light of the Spirit.I have been listening to this album quite a lot since I bought it.(To the uninitiated Kitaro listeners: Kitaro is intrumental new age. He takes his influences from many countries but you can always feel the delicate Japanese sound of his music. His music ranges from soft, dainty songs, to dramatic scores that sound like they are from an epic movie to mysterious and sometimes menacing pieces. Note Crystal Sands on this album for an example of the latter.)"
4,Sumerian delight.,"I am very impressed with how well Kitaro blends the tastes of Egypt with those of Sumeria. Very well done.However, I think the synthesizers get overused and the traditional instruments get underused. In the middle of the album, I wait for some Middle Eastern instrument to start going solo but it never happens. Crystal Sand is the only thing that holds it all together."
3,Not the best one .,"Definitely better than "" Dream "". But again it is not a real Kitaro . So sad ...At list I felt few of the tracks ... but it still reminds me his move to "" elevator "" music direction after he left Japan . He just had to stay the same : one of the most talanted musicians in the world ."
5,GREAT! AWESOME! AMAZING!,"everysince this show first came out i would clollect the books, dvds, comic books, everything. but i couldnt get a whole of this series until i found it on amazon. thanks this means a lot."
3,The Answer to the First Question Review,"Actually Sailor Moon Sailor Stars has never been Dubbed English but if lucky you could find a Bootleg one with fansubs (It's better than nothing). Though you can watch the eps on Youtube. I doubt this set is English Subbed notheless Dubbed but if you can understand Japanese or even just understand the story by watching then you're good. Other than so US can't watch the Sailor Stars (The 5th Series) without some type of translation. (I want to see Sailor Stars as well, don't feel bad)I only watch up to season Three. I have yet to see Four, Five and the Sailor R movie."
1,Grrr...,My copy doesn't work! The discs are defective! But I was able to watch enough of it to find out what happens.
4,GREAT BOOK ABOUT A GREAT LEGEND!,"I'VE FOLLOWED BJK'S CAREER SINCE SHE WON HER 1ST WIMBLEDON TITLE IN 1961! THIS BOOK GIVES YOU A VERY CANDID LOOK INTO THE LIFE OF THIS GREAT TENNIS LEGEND, THE STUGGLES SHE FOUGHT BOTH PERSONAL & PUBLIC.INTERSTING DETAILS ON THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES WITH BOBBY RIGGS AND HIS LIFE.AN EASY ENJOYABLE READ FOR ANYONE, BUT ESP. FOR TENNIS FANS FROM THE 60'S70'S ON!"
3,Goes A Bit Off Track,"Some interesting archaeology about the now nearly forgotten King-Riggs tennis match. Roberts, of the NYT, brings to life how important this thing seemed at the time, even though it all looks decidedly quaint today. Where the author goes off is when she tries to relate this to the federal Title 9 law on equality for women in sports. It's a bit forced, even if valid. Perhaps it's the book's herky-jerky structure that is just not nuanced enough to make this work. She also includes some interesting background about the Williams sisters, the relevance being that they later reaped what Billie Jean King sowed, financially. Maybe so. In the end, Riggs comes off more sympathetic than pathetic, and King is a bit too deified. Still, this is some high quality social history about an episode whose effects still have an echo."
5,"the best about a great person, and tennis player",she changed the world that nite. read this to know how.
3,"Unexpected, still charming","Although the ABC book is indeed charming with adorable illustrations, Tasha Tudor did not in fact illustrate any of this book. Collectors of Tasha Tudor's work might be disappointed to discover she is inaccurately cited as one of the illustrators. However, the book appeals to preschoolers and fits nicely into a young child's hand. My daughter was delighted by the colorful pictures."
4,Muy cara musica,"This CD has 3 songs from each of the 4 finalists in the Spanish 2004 Eurovision contest. They range from Modern Flamenco to ballads to a soft rock type. All are very good, and a few are unbelieveably well written and performed. I could definitely see one of these winning the main Eurovision Finals in Istanbul in May 2004. This is not Latin-style music (except for about 2 songs), which most of us Americans expect when Spanish-language music is heard, but example of really good modern popular music heard in Spain."
1,Rubbish,"I gut to say as a Spanish that all this related to operation triunfo is a crappy stinkey burden for those who like true music and honest compositions, whaterever style they belong to.We are really fed up of all this 'pop idol' miseria that only help us living in a less creative and spontaneous world, slaving us just for consumism and stupid fashions that are forgotten in a short time's lapse.As a lover of music I'll never feel any respect for this sad panthomima, this stupid circus into where they involve us all from the mass media. I invite you to never listen to this record and to save the money for a little more cultural and interesting thing. Why not next Mike Oldfield's record?Could be... ;)"
5,There is no substitute for the WORD BOOK III,"In 1988, I changed jobs, and found myself in a position that required written detailed reports. As with all things, if you don't use it, you lose it. The WORD BOOK III came to be well used over the years. Everyone wanted to borrow it, resulting in a missing page in the 'ex' section. The pages were separated from the binding to the point that they had to be stuffed back in place after each use. So, I broke down and replaced my beloved helper, that has proven time and again to be more accurate than spell check. If you need help with spelling, you will find it to be a reliable friend!"
5,Stays with you for years,"I had the previous issue for several years. You may not need it often, but it sure comes in handy when you do."
5,great,"Dave Pike is one of the best vibes players in jazz music for the longest time, but yet very underrated and this is one on his best works."
2,no,The smell was awful. I did not like this product at all. I will not buy again. Not what it says it is.
3,Essential Oil Sampler-average at best,"I bought these oils to use in my Homemedic air revitalizer. It originally came with Brethe scents but the replacements were amazingly costly. I thought I would try these oils and see what transpired. I guess for the price that I could not expect much but they were just average at best. It IS a good price for 6 oils and they all did smell exactly as I expected them to. They just did not work that well at deodorizing the room. The scent would last about 10 minutes and then it would just evaporate. Perhaps I should work on different combinations or different dilutions and see how well that works. But for now, just using a few drops right into the water, it is nothing to write home about."
5,This book's detail and storytelling reveals a great writer.,"Another Day in Paradise is one of the greatest books I have ever read.The book's descriptivness is scary to the point of tears, and leavesme wanting more from Eddie Little."
4,"Thrill ride of a crime drama, full of drugs, and, well, surprising introspection","At first, I thought this book was an auto-biographical account of drug abuse and crime, but as I got more involved with the outrageous tale, I wondered how anyone could publish such details without fear of prosecution for drug possession, murder, and robbery. It was only then that I checked the author biography and learned that Eddie Little had in fact spent time in jail and rehab, but this was written as a work of fiction. Of course, given Little's colorful background, I don't doubt that some aspects of the story are based on actual happenings in his life on the streets.Sure, this tale is over-the-top. Drugs are over-the-top. This is a crime thriller as well as a touching inter-personal drama. I enjoyed this as much as I did the outstanding sleeper of a movie by the same name, starring Melanie Griffith and James Woods)."
5,On Paradise . . .,"This book was the most surprising combination of fast-paced, gritty, and touching that I have ever read. The characters all shine in their own slightly disturbed way. By the novel's end, Bobbie has fulfilled his desire of being a tough guy--by surving and still retaining some evidence of a heart."
4,"Great photos, maybe too much text.","As a big fan of Eliot Porter's color nature photography (so real it's surreal), I bought this book for his unique take on the strangest continent on the planet. That Porter was nearing 75 years of age when he went to Antarctica on this NSF sponsored venture makes his accomplishment all the more amazing. This is some of his best work. One only wishes, now that he's a decade gone, that there were 50% more pictures...The travelogue/diary style text dragged at times for me, though especially those who share Porter's interest in bird behavior will maybe find some useful information in it. There's a little bit of interesting history, as well as some geology, but few insights into how these remarkable photos were made or the deeper thoughts of the man who made them. This is probably good, because if Porter had spent his time being a great writer we probably wouldn't have as much extraordinary photography."
2,A disappointing production of a great novel,"This version of the Scarlet Pimpernel is infinitely inferior to the 1982 version starring Anthony Andrews, Jane Seymour, and Ian McKellan. The screenplay is incoherent and confusing; events necessary to the understanding of the story are shown in flashback, usually long after the viewer needs the information. The dialogue runs the gamut from the witty to the banal (the prison scene between Marguerite and Percy exhibits the most offensively trite dialogue). But the worst aspect of this video is the casting of Elizabeth McGovern as Marguerite. Even playing a former actress is a stretch for her. Richard Grant as Percy and Martin Shaw as Chauvelin are quite good, although not nearly as good as Anthony Andrews and Ian McKellan in the same roles.The Scarlet Pimpernel is a wonderfully heroic, romantic story set in the French Revolution. This 1998 A&E production does not do it justice."
1,"Bad casting, bad acting, bad script, bad show","The above says it all. Elizabeth McGovern was a particularly bad choice, and the script managed to remove all the intrigue and excitement. Absolutely the worst thing I have ever viewed on television."
4,Percy is a masterpiece,"Richard E Grant as Percy is a delight to behold. Sure the content is not even close to the book but as a joyous character who takes every delight in thumbing his nose at the baddies, he is spectacular! Elizabeth McGovern is incredibly lousy on the other hand. There is no feeling at all for Marguerite and I would happily have let her head be chopped off. As a light-hearted piece of fluff, this movie is great! I really enjoyed it!"
3,Decent but could have been better.,"This movie based loosely (and I mean loosely) upon Baron Orczy's classic ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" had good costuming and decent acting but overall lacked inspiration. Elizabeth Mcgovern's performance as Lady Marguerite Blakeney while technically plausible again lacked heart and true believability as was the same with Richard E. Grants somewhat charmless performance as Sir Percy Blakeney. However overall this is a quite amusing interpretation of Orczy's classic but one should not expect too much from this movie."
2,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I usually love BBC/A&E productions, but was very disappointed by their adaptation of The Scarlet Pimpernel. A mediocre cast and bad lines ruined what could potentially be a wonderfully exciting movie. The man who played Percy showed little emotion, and just didn't suit his role well. There was little chemistry between Percy and his wife, making for a very flat romantic plot in the movie. Though it was only three hours long (very short by BBC standards!), it seemed to be monotonously slow. In my opinion, the only worthwhile performance was by Emilia Fox, who portrayed the traitorous actress Minette. The only reason I wouldn't give this drama one star is because of its excellent costume/set design, which is always an added bonus in any period film."
1,Poor Adaptation,"This was the worst version of the Pimpernel I have ever seen. It had poor casting (the actors neither looked their part, or played it very well,) and the story line was nothing like the book. Percy wasn't charming and funny as he should be, Marguerite didn't seem to do her witty lines very well, and Chauvelin was too old and not sinister enough. For any fans of the book, play, or other movies I strongly suggest the 1982 version with Antony Andrews, Jane Seymore, and Sir Ian McKellen. that is the best one."
4,Pretty Good,"I really enjoyed the A and E version of the Scarlet Pimpernel. I have not read the novel, so I don't know how different it is. Grant was extroadinary--I could not believe he is the guy who was in Bram Stoker's Dracula! McGovern was so-so."
1,Not of Eriko's best.....,"im kinda disappointed with ""RED BEAT OF MY LIFE"". I was expecting better. Her new single ""LUV IS MAGIC"" is much more good than this single. I didnt really appreciate the beat of this single though i usually like fast-paced music. Ill take Hiro's ""AS TIME GOES BY"", Takako's ""MY FIRST LOVE"" and Hitoe's ""INORI"" than this single."
4,N64 Star Wars racer,It's an old one but it's still fun for the N64 lovers. I never got bored with it!
5,I waited a long time,"Once I used Poser 4, running it under Virtual PC on a Mac (I refuse to use PCs unless at gunpoint, and only if the gun is loaded). So, the arrival of a nifty Mac version is like...'heaven'? Something like that. Only had it for a few days and still exploring. Lots of new stuff, lots of things rearranged, but, I feel, sensibly so. It makes it more complex, but the extra up-front learning effort will no doubt be worth it.Till NoeverAuthor: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIPowlglass.com"
5,A good sized stuffed Mickey,This is a gift for my mom as part of the Disney characters I purchased from Amazon. The decent size makes a nice ornament to the room and she enjoyed this gift.
2,ELECTRIC LIGHTING of the 20s&30s,"I ORDERED THIS BOOK TO ACTUALLY LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THE LIGHTSOF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE TITLE. I AM SAD TO SAY THAT I KNOW AS MUCH NOW AS I DID BEFORE GETTING IT.IF YOU ENJOY LOOKING AT B&W; (SOME COLOR) PICTURES OF REPRINTS OF OLDLIGHTING CATALOGS , THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU.

THIS BOOK HASNONE OF THIS . IT'S REALLY JUST A PICTURE BOOK WITH ARBITRARY PRICE LIST.ABOUT THE ONLY GOOD THING I COULD SAY ABOUT IT IS IT IS CHEAP."
1,Not worth the money,"I replaced the ironing board my mother got in 1957 with this...what a mistake! The first one fell repeatedly, even if you weren't in the room. That caused my new iron to get the sole plate bent. The cover started coming apart the first few weeks too. Contacted Rowenta and they had me send the cover and the iron to be ""reviewed"". They replaced the ironing board and the iron...but alas...the new ironing board is crooked and rocks, causing the new iron to fall off and bend the sole plate. Now I have a rocking ironing board and a bent iron that cost me over $200! Keep your money, buy a $25 ironing board and a $25 iron...you will be better off in the long run!"
4,Very sturdy ironing board,"I bought this when I bought my Rowenta DX-8800 iron. It's nice and wide, and quite sturdy. I'm not crazy about the rack where the iron can rest, but that's a minor issue."
2,Difficult to open and close,"I could not believe how difficult this board was to open, I actually had to pry the lifting latching mechanism out of place to get the board to open and the same maneuver to get it to close. It is clearly a design flaw since the lifting / holding arms cannot move freely because the support channel for the lower tray prevents it from doing so."
5,Superb ironing board,"I hesitated about buying this because of the price, but it is well worth it. Also, i bought it at a store with a discount coupon, which saved me 20%. I ruined irons because they fell off my old wobbly board, but this one is very solid. It will pay for itself in irons saved. Things are easier to iron, and iron much smoother. Has to be the board since I haven't changed irons."
5,Rowenta Ironing Board,"This ironing board was a gift to my husband. He uses it for quilt making. It is WONDERFUL!! It is much wider than our old ironing board and works especially well for tablecloths, cloth napkins plus the quilt tops. We both enjoy using it. It makes an excellent gift for sewers and people who like to iron their pillowcases, tablecloths and other wide pieces. Plus having the rack at the end of it to place your iron gives you more space for what you're ironing."
3,Sturdy but awkward,"I bought this ironing board because my cheap one was no longer perfectly flat. It's very nice in that pad is great and I have a lot more ironing surface. But I find it awkward to fold up and put away, especially since I have arthritis in my fingers. The board is wide and you have to put both arms around it to press on two levers, then it sort of collapses all at once. I also wish that the iron rest was removable because my gravity-feed iron doesn't fit in it. I had to place a separate silicone-coated iron rest on it, and it's not very secure."
2,You'll Stub your toes,"I have a Rowenta Ironing board & I like that it is wide so I can iron fabric that is 42"" wide. However the front legs are way too wide & protrude byond the front point of the board. This has caused me to stub my toes repeatedly. I would rather have a custom board that fits over the top a regular ironing board. I wouldn't buy this ironing board again."
4,rowenta board iron integrated rest,"I just got my Rowenta iron board and know I will like the stability and size, BUT the iron rest has me baffled. There is no info on how to place the iron on the rest. When I put it flat on the rest (as I finally saw in a picture somewhere) the iron continues to steam and water drips on the floor. If I place the iron (precariousely) on it's heel on the rest it doesn't seem to be very stable....Anyone else have this same challange....I know my girlfriend who has the same ironing board has the same issue.."
3,"Sturdy, but large and heavy","This is an excellent ironing board for someone who leaves the board up all the time, but for those who would store it between uses, I found it cumbersome. In fact, the height of the folded board (and attached iron stand) was such that the board would not fit in my cleaning closet. I did not measure it, and can only say that the folded height exceeded 64"". I also found that the board was somewhat uncomfortably heavy to lift, although this feature contributed to its stability when in use. I ended by trading ironing boards with my daughter, who irons in basement and who gave me a small lightweight board in exchange."
5,great buy,"I bought this for personal use. It is a commodious tool for a comfortable ironing. Don't think twice about its price because it is certainly worthwhile. Ergonomically designed, looks great, fits clothes properly."
2,"Great at first, up doesn't hold up","I purchased this ironing board about 1-1/2 years ago. Loved it at first,very nice, worked well, excellent board. But after a little over a year, it decides it doesn't want to say at the height I want. It starts collapsing down to a lower level, won't stay at a comfortable height. I called the company, it does have a 10 year guarantee. At first they said take it to a repair company, I had already looked for one, doesn't exist.When I questioned the quarantee, I was put on hold while the rep checked.When he came back, he told me there was no local place take it (I liveoutside Chicago), that it had to be mailed back! I could probably buy a new board for the price of packaging and mail. No solution for this problem in sight."
4,A Nice Heavy Ironing Board,"Overall I think this is a nice ironing board. I like the wideness of the board and the pad is nice and thick. The iron holder on the large end of the board is handy, but cannot be removed. This presents a problem for me as I have always used the large end of the board to do the majority of my ironing (especially shirts) and can't lay the shirt over the large end of the board with the iron holder attachment. After years of ironing this way, it has been a real pain trying to change the way I iron and use the small end of the board. I mainly bought this board to replace my old board that was tippy, and my iron had fell off several times. I had to request a replacement for the first board I received since it was as tipsy as my old board on a hard floor. The replacement is more stable on a hard floor, but not as stable as I think it should be for such a high priced ironing board."
3,Rowenta IB-6200 Pro Ironing Board,"Great ironing board for stability & overall ironing-surface size. Side, metal storage area is OK, but not really necessary, as is the under board rack. The muslin-type cover scorches too easily, though, and the cover also gets a tea-stain look if excess water meets the surface, such as an overpour into a steam iron."
5,Love this board!,"I bought a display model of this ironing board three years ago, and I adore it.As a sewist, I spend a lot of time pressing fabric. The larger surface area of this board has made this a simpler and quicker process. This ironing board is also taller and more stable than others. The area to set the iron and hang hangers is also a plus.The only downside is that the bulk of this board makes ironing shirts difficult. I still need a regular ironing board to iron dress shirts."
3,This ironing board is for a younger person,This is a high quality ironing board but unless you have sufficient hand strength to adjust the height it is difficult to overcome the strong springs that facilitate the height adjustment. This board also weighs in around 20 pounds which is much too heavy for older people to handle easily. I'm sending it back for a lighter duty ironing board.
2,Solid but the iron rest gets in the way,"The board is very stable and quite wide, which are good things. The cover does not fit very well but the cover is thick and seems well made. One of the feet pads was broken on arrival - probably happened during shipping. The iron rest is very annoying acutally. I had concerns about this but ordered it anyway on the strong reviews. It prevents you from using the wide end of the ironing board, which is really handy on shirts. The iron rest is not removable. Overall, I could not recommend, since this is an expensive board and the iron rest is not removable and ill fitting cover."
1,No delivery,"Order placed on Nov 9 with $28.95 shipping costs. More than 1 month later, I'm still waiting for delivery and no news what so ever..."
2,Works ok for a while,"This is a fun device. However, if you want to use it frequently, I don't recommend it. Changing times to anything accurate is hard, you either go too far one direction or the other. I have two of them and wish I had something where I can accurately set the time I want. One of them started being quite touchy and when I tried to add, say, 10 seconds, it goes 20-30 seconds, then I try to go back and lower the time and then it is now 20-30 seconds less. Setting the right time is pretty hard."
1,ugh,"terrible, no directions sent, and didnt work (or i needed the directions to get it to work. thankfully amazon allowed me to return it"
1,UGH!!!,For 65 dollars i expect more then just long and boring plot descriptions with one sentence at the end saying the author liked/disliked it!!
4,"Fairly decent, not the ""best cd ever recorded""","(. . .) First of all, I bought solely for the Primus connection and for the incredible talent of ""Herb."" He is an amazing drummer.This is kind of a mix of Primus meets Mr. Bungle meets Limbomaniacs meets Faith No More meets (insert the band of your choice here). I suppose it can be broken down as follows:Bass and Drum wise, very Primus.Odd-ball sounds that are featured, very Mr. Bungle. Same goes for the often abrupt chord changes and measure progression.Guitar wise, very Faith No More and Limbomaniacs.Vocals, very Mike Patton. VERY. Picture Mike as he attempts to sing in his low-key, operatic style, and you've got the idea. Imagine ""Epic"" or ""A Small Victory"" by FNM and you definitely get the picture.Beyond the similarities of other bands though, Laundry stands on its own pretty dam* well. Kind of a dark tone to the whole cd, but I think the comparisons to TOOL are a bit misplaced. Just a bit.If you can find it, definitely get it. (. . .)"
5,Great!!!,"This is a must have. Strange times, great progression and fabulous vocals! This is one of my favorite albums...ever! We should not judge art, but this album deserves prays from music lovers."
2,Imagine Seven Mary Three taking a stab at creativity...,"...They would still rot. This is Laundry, San Francisco's hybrid grunge/Primus/Mr. Bungle band featuring drummer Tim Alexander, formally of Primus. With the exception of Alexander's superb percussion, this is a total waste of plastic, loaded with the Eddie Vedder wannabe vocal stylings of Toby Hawkins. Typical of a record to come out of the mid-nineties post Grunge bandwagoning, ""Blacktongue"" is nothing more than a Candlebox album with some strange time signatures. Why Herb, why?"
3,My review of robinson crusoe,"Daniel Defoe is a great auther and is veary good at making the reader see the image the he is discribing to the reader. This Adventure story of a shipwrecked sailer, was marooned on a deserted island to save himself from the terrible death of drowning in the water like all his shipmates. He lives on the islands for over 30 years. Living off the livestock and anything he can find thats is edible. He makes a home for himself. His life away from civilization is threatened when he finds a mans footprint in the sand. This is very cool when he survives on the island for so long and then findes himself with canables. Robinson crusoe is a fiction book. he would never have thought that he could stay alive in the mess that his life was tacking corse of. He couldn't belive when he saw the footprints in the sand. He met someone named friday who was a canible aswell.Jordan 6th Grader"
5,"buy all your cables here for apple computers, t.v etc! cables for dummies!","i am a mom, trying to wire the kids to tvs, game cube etc w/ new apple laptop computers and not hire computer support people. after going to best buy twice to buy cables at $50/piece and then return cuz they sold me wrong ones, to hook up computers to tv monitors, i was told by a salesperson that i can buy for under 5/piece on amazon. when i searched amazon, it was confusing as to what i needed and this site had great pictures and descriptions and my cable was perfect and 3.50 plus shipping. i was thrilled, it came quickly and no surprises!!!! i will use them again for all my cables. it is a huge rip off at the stores. apple charges 30-50 for every cable and attachment and beleive me there is a special one needed for every little thing. but with this site, it is al cheap and easy! call apple support to find out what you need and order here!"
4,Good,"Quality of the product seems good, the only problem is that i bought this for my ps3 and my monitor but found out that my monitor does not have the HDCP so the wire did not work for me. Tho the shipping was fast :P"
2,Misleading product info,"Received the cable today and turned out to be a different cable than what's described at Amazon. The DVI end of the cable turned out to be single link (18 pins), instead of dual link (24 pins). The product picture shows 24 pins, although a customer image, which I didn't see before ordering, does clearly show there are only 18 pins. In the technical details section, it also claims it has 24 pins on DVI end.I am aware that no where in the product description the manufacturer claims it's a dual link cable. But you have to wonder...This cable might have been a great single link cable, but when the product is not as advertised, I have to give it fewer stars. Here is a link for DVI info: [...]"
3,Misleading info...,"I too agree that the information is misleading. I was expecting a dual-link cable, given the information and the picture. However, it is only single-link. That being said, the quality is good, but it would be nice to have gotten what I thought I had ordered and paid for."
1,False Advertisement 2011,"this is not as it says, just get the amazon basics or something similar, works but like everyone else, not like it says, i want what i paid for."
1,didn't work,"cable came out to install new drv with this cable , no signal! we had to use composite cable,JG"
4,No scarcity of talent,"This novel was published in paperback with 'Let Me Alone', also by Anna Kavan. 'Let Me Alone' is such a staggering novel (despite some flat spots in the middle) that it took me a while to pluck up the courage to attack 'A Scarcity of Love'. 'A Scarcity of Love' is not as strong a novel as 'Let Me Alone'(for me it hardly could be) but it is very rewarding.If you search for 'Let Me Alone' at Amazon.com you will not find it with the other Anna Kavan works. However, it is in the Amazon.com catalogue under the author's alternative - and very rarely used - earlier publishing name of Helen Woods Edmonds."
5,More Western Than You Can Imagine!,"Wow! This book is the difference between a 1960's western TV show and a modern western Movie.The Author holds nothing back as he creates the movie in your mind. What struck me was how he captures the political incorrectness of that time. From killing an Indian, to shooting horses, and the way women were treated back then. That's when it hits you... this really was once a very wild west and it was kill or be killed! Eating was more for staying alive than it was for enjoyment (like it is today). I highly recommend this graphic adventure and if you are a western fan you will be hooked on L.J. Martin's Montana series."
4,Great Video!,"As with most Nova productions, this one was very educational. I'm so glad they make videos that are so indepth as this! As a big dinosaur fan, I offer my sincerest thanks!"
3,2 LPs on 1 CD -- SOUTHERN COMFORT / YO HO,"I don't know about you, but for me the first session is over latinized. The conga drummer Barretto seems to be playing up front instead of behind the band. Great latin jazz if you like it."
3,jewish candy mold,size of mold patterns were smaller than imaginedand not good for pastry at all!pastry hard to dislodgegood variety of jewish icons/symbols thoughcute details on mold itself
2,Superficial approach to genetic psychology,"This is a very easy-to-read book on the genetic or evolutionary basis of sexual behavior. However, in an attempt to make the topic acceptable as a popular psychology piece of writing, the author's coverage of issues such as mating choices, sexual behavior, etc. is very bland and superficial.The entire book is based on assertions not backed up by research. This leads the book to look like a compendium on urban folklore rather than an introduction to evolutionary psychology. The very superficial explanations given to topics such as ""why humans is the only species whose females have developed breasts"" or ""why even married men masturbate"" make a mockery of what properly researched genetics have found.Anyone wishing to learn about evolutionary psychology applied to human sexual behaviour is recommended to read ""The Evolution of Desire"" by David Buss. Probably the best thing written for readers with limited background on the subject matter."
2,"Interesting thesis, but redundant to the point of boredom.","Small has an interesting thesis, but I found the book to be quite redundant, restating the same information over and over again in several chapters. In some cases the information changed when restated. As a scientist Small should be ashamed that she confuses millimeters (a measure of distance) with milliliters (a measure of volume) when discussing the amount of semen ejaculated. Her discussion of AIDS is also poorly done. For a book published in 1995, it is out of date on epidemiological and risk factor information. For example she fails to even mention that HIV can be transmitted through vaginal secretions and breast milk. In summary, I found this book very disappointing and would not recommend it."
2,"okay, but not perfect","After a couple more years of education and reading, I have to look back and re-review this book.Frankly, the reader from Ohio is correct; this book isn't perfect, is redundant, and I definitely cannot accept it as an introduction into these sorts of topics.Rather, I'd like to turn your attention towards a far better book, ""Anatomy of Love"" by Helen Fisher, Ph.D."
5,great,"item was ordered on amazon usa to be sent to my son who is studying in the usa then he brought it home at christmas for my daughter , it looks great it has loads of info on horses breeds size colours etc it will help her with her stable exams . quick delivery and great price thanks"
4,Loved it!,My daughter got this for Christmas and loves it! She is a true horse lover and enjoyed playing this edition!
3,"Charming, but the audio quality is very poor.","These are classic cartoons with a wonderful romantic quality, but I find the audio quality (or lack thereof) to be distracting at times."
4,High class animation is great fun to watch!,"This is a terrific title for kids and adults, full of cute characters and beautiful backgrounds. Hand has truly brought to life a magical forest. There are many different stories detailing the exploits of the animals in the forest. I am reminded of the classic period of animation back in the 30's, when Disney and Warner Brothers were the kings!"
4,You gotta stay happy,"This is a fine film that is slapstick and silliness all rolled together. Joan Fontaine has made better films, but she shines as always. I really think it's worth watching and as a twenty-something person I hope people don't forget gems like this one."
5,Helped my eyes,"My acupuncturist recommended fish oil for brain and mood improvement, so I'd been trying different kinds. I took this for a couple of weeks and realized I could read the tiny type on my computer screen again! Maybe everything isn't irreversibly falling apart after all : ) I still need high DHA, so I pair one of these with a 500mg calamari oil."
3,"Odd shape, can't get down throat.","The product may be OK, but for me, I couldn't get it down. I thought it would go down easly from reviews from others. I had to bite the softgel and just swallow the oil which defeats the purpose of it having an enteric coating. I usually like a lot of Nature's Way products, but this time I had to go with Irwin Labs Ginkgo Smart. It may be great if you can swallow it. (It is a short pill, but to me it is a bit fat which may be why it gets stuck in my throat every time. Also, I don't take big capsules or softgels (not the 1000 mg fish oil pills either, so this may work for you. Others don't seem to have a problem with it.)"
1,I do not recieve it more than one month after my purchase!,I do not recieve it more than one month after my purchase!
3,"looks nice, not sturdy enough for a heavy piece","I had a very heavy tray to hang horizontally, so the short measurement was about 11 inches. The spring on the back of this just kept stretching out whenever I let the tray sit on its own. The springs can be clipped with wire cutters, and then stretched to the needed size, and then wrapped back around the ""w"" part of the hanger for a shorter spring. Ultimately, with this extra rigging on my part, I made this work, but it wouldn't work on its own."
1,Jankity!,"This product says that it comes with mounting hardware but does not. The one I received had a hole in the package so I thought it may have fallen out. Amazon sent me another one, but it too came without hardware. Also the second one looked like it had been sitting in salt water; the brass coating was corroded. Its a good this is inexpensive because its a very cheap product. I would not use it for a plate/platter that has much more value than the hanger costs."
3,incomplete,"I wanted a hanger that was rated specifically for the size and weight of my tray, which this is; however, the package states that hanging hardware is included, which it is not. Hmmm."
4,A Must for your DSP library set.,Lots of practical code examples. Practical filtering routines and example code.Includes a general introduction to C /C++ concepts frequently used in DSP algorithm development. A good introduction to image processing is included. The DSP function library and sample code is perhaps the best part of the book.
3,Puzzling Image Format,"This book is rather well written. I have read both the C++ and C versions. The contents of both books are more or less the same, just the difference in the C language used. Source Codes provided compiled neatly without and need for modification, which is really cool. However, the image files provided are really puzzling. The book says the images are in a DSP data format. So far I can only get the programs to work on the 2 images (.dat) provided. I tried using other .dat images from the net, and many other formats, including monochromatic raw images, but it wouldn't work. Another reason I only gave 3 stars is because the book doesn't provide any online help or an email of the authors. Personally I feel that this book is more for professionals who is already trained in DSP."
5,My Favorite Mouse - Smooth & Quiet,"Three handy buttons (press down on scroll wheel to open pages in new tab, for example), the quietest scroll wheel ever, and fast and precise movement. It's small enough to be quite comfortable in my hand, too (I used to have a different brand mouse that was WAY too large for my hand). Works on all sort of surfaces that my old optical mouse had trouble with.AND the scroll wheel, while being silent, still has the ""one click at a time"" feel that I like for precise up and down movement.I want to buy more just to stock up."
2,I must have gotten a bad one....,"I've had this mouse for a week now and I just can't get used to it. No matter how I adjust the click speed in Windows Control Panel, I'm still having to go through three or four failed attempts before I get a successful click on an icon. I don't know what it is, but I just can't click fast enough (or slow enough, apparently) to make this thing work right.Also, I am not happy with the ergonomics of this mouse. Something about the curvature causes my hand to ache after using it a short while.I am hoping I can return it and trade it for something else."
1,Avoid at any and all costs,"I bought this mouse to replace a Gear Head OM3800U mouse that when used, the curser would jump around. I plugged this mouse in and immediately noticed improved tracking, and just an overall better feel. Used it all day, then went to bed. Got up next morning, went to the computer and moved the mouse to ""wake up"" the computer......NOTHING. Moved it again......NOTHING. Hit the spacebar and the computer woke up, but the cursor would not move. Rebooted 3X.......NOTHING. I installed the old mouse.I returned the defective mouse and did an even exchange for a new (same model) mouse. Brought it home, plugged it in and started using it - worked great......for about an hour. Right in the middle of a project, the cursor froze. I installed the old mouse, came here, logged in and started typing this cautionary tale: DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE. My next email is to Gear Head."
2,Spooky flicker,I thought this would produce a soft candle-like glow but it had more of a spooky Halloweenish effect. Ended up not working for the intended purpose in an antique crystal electric lamp.
2,poor quality,"I am very dissatisfied with this product. It has seeds, and they must be removed as the seeds are inedible. There are also stems, which needs to be picked out. Will not be ordering from this vendor again."
2,"Lots of stems, not potent!","I had high hopes for these peppercorns, but unfortuantly they are the same sub-par stuff they sell at my local asian markets. Lots of stems to pick through & even after I toasted them the flavor was just not there. If you know your szechuan peppercorns, you know the difference between quality & not, these are not. I bought 2 pounds, I opened one of the packages, but am returning the unopened one."
3,"Interesting, exotic perfumed peppercorn","Beautiful pink and reddish color, exotic scent, very floral. I bought this to make a chinese pickled cucumber dish, but 8 oz. of this product is a LOT of product. I ground them in my mortar and pestle as per the recipe, but the peppercorn shells stuck in my throat and made me cough. Next time I will take the time to remove the shells afater grinding."
4,Not seed-free,"Although these are said to be ""hull-only,"" there are still a lot of seeds--so much so that I can't cook with these until I have sorted through and removed all the little black devils lurking amongst the delicious hulls. If you find that your dishes have an unpleasantly gritty texture, the seeds are to blame. Delicious, but not as advertised."
3,Lack flavor,"I thought I wrote a review but it magically disappeared. Anyway, here it goes again. These peppercorns are okay but lack the punch of better ones I have had in the past. Those are hard to find though. You taste them in dishes like shuizhurou in authentic Sichuan restaurants, also hard to find."
4,I love this series,The Wayfarer series has been very entertaining. I have enjoyed seeing the way the characters have grown and become so different than when the series started.The only problem I have had with this series is the lack of proof reading. You really have to be careful as you read and pay attention. ie: Carlon is often Carion. If you do not pay attention you can get lost forever. I do not know if this is just in the Kindle editions or if the books have this problem also. So be watchful and enjoy a great story.
4,WARNING!!!!--contains spoilers,"So let me just say, I loved the Axis trilogy (even though Axis- is pompas and has a huge ego). This series was really good too, only it got a little weird. I mean incestual!!! Caleum and RiverStar???? Whoa, cousins i guess i can deal with but even I have to draw the line somewhere. Axis is still his old self! It's really annoying he's soo full of himself arg! Heaven forbid anyone but him save the world!! At least Faraday is back, i can't believe that she didn't tell Axis off I would have! Well at least now she's found someone else . . .Drago (what a twisted family) And i feel really bad for StarDrifter! He can't find anyone one to love (except Zenith- who betrays him for WolfStar- I kinda prefer the bad boy myself). The only other problem with this series are the names, i mean really Tree Friend, and StarMan ummm can we say corny! But a really excelent series that all sci fi readers should read."
1,dross,"I'm afraid there's little to add to Sara Douglass' long history of barely adequate books. An example of well-marketed, poorly planned/written, lack of original ideas, books. She started with the numbingly appalling Battleaxe - filled with every cliche known (and how do you carry a two-headed battle axe on your belt? Can you slip on a feather? Can a fight last for hours?) and she continues her tradition with this new series. In Australia, we have the advantage of having access to more of her work. I wish we didn't. Each time a new book of hers comes out I swear I won't bother reading it but I do to see if they get better. Maybe one day..."
5,Always a Surprise!,"I must say that one of the reasons I love Sara Douglass is because I never know what to expect when I pick up her books. Ms. Douglass does not fall into the trap of writing ""formula"" books and Pilgrim is no exception! The character development of Drago, which was really begun in Sinner, continues, and will surprise and I think delight many fans of the series. Unlike some other reveiwers, I found the development of the more well established characters (like Faraday and Axis) added significanly to their depths, (even if one would like to shake them on occasion!). After reading Pilgrim, both Faraday and Axis seem more ""human"" in their reactions to the situations and choices they face. Readers will not find Pilgrim disappointing, though they may be saddened that there is only one book left to this great series!"
2,The downward spiral continues,"The ties that binded this mythology together begin to unravel. As I enjoyed the first three, it is a sad thing to have to say, but the characters leave much to be desired, the story is splintered, and the brutality is often unnecessarily gruesome."
3,LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED,"Unlike Schiffer's ""Ultimate Look"" series about the B-32 and B-29,this book is devoid of any narrative. It is a collection of captionedphotos, mostly black and white.There is no development history or diagrams/photos of any of theB-24's systems - engines, armament, bombing equipment, etc. If I hadthe opportunity to browse through it in a bookstore, I would not havepurchased it."
2,Overpriced for what is nothing more than a scrapbook,"A nice collection of photographs of B-24 Liberators and Privateers. It's more like a scrap book than anything else. Divided into somewhat arbitrary sections dealing with combat shots; nose art; the Navy uses; a post-war section about scrapping and colour shots including a sub-section on the Lady Be Good.There is no context whatsoever relating to development of the Liberator. For example, no explanation is given for why the B-24N and the Privateer have a single vertical stabilizer. Perhaps tha authors assumed buyers with have such knowledge or they felt any such explanation was not part of the book.My copy also included what I call the usual Schiffer typos and grammer errors.As I was looking for a design history, this book did not fulfill my needs."
5,Savy and Experienced,"Fred Wackerlee has been on the forefront of senior executive recruiting for many years. I have been waiting for this book and frankly I have not been disappointed. It is the best. Bravo Fred! He captures the intersancum of what happens in CEO selection & succession. He should know - he has been there and has the street smarts to see what is really happening. Fred knows the myths of the CEO succession process and why today it needs changing - especially with the malfeasance of the 90s. This book is a must-read for executives & academics who care about the future of free enterprise, corporate leadership, talent and stockholders."
1,No Longer Made in America,This was the best foot file ever but now they are manufactured in China and they really suck! Until the manufacturer switches back I will not purchase this brand anymore. Do not buy this foot file. This company is representing that this is the same foot file but it is not. Last year they switched to a Chinese manufacturer and the quality is very poor.
2,"After about 16 uses, one of the pads came off.","I used this about twelve times in the shower before one of the pads, the fine one, started loosening and came off after several more uses."
4,Foot File,Not convinced these do that much good. We were sold this by a wonderful Spa in Chiago area and needed two for each bath area. They do a very good job but don't solve the problem permanently
5,The Blessing of a Broken Heart,This book is amazing. It tells about how the mother of her murdered son copes with the horrible loss. Learning her faith in God helped her get through this--brings her closer to God. Incredibly strong woman.
3,good intro,"A nice and tidy volume to learn, refer and teach. It can be used along with John Davies' book on Low dimensional semiconductors. Only some very necessary ideas are given exposure here. For more in depth learning one should check other books. But for advanced undergarduates this is a recommendable volume."
5,"""I Can't Cry Hard Enough"" A very touching song","Swing the Statue is worth owning just for Vic's version of ""I Can't Cry Hard Enough."" That song has become a favorite of mine. The rest of the album is touching as well, with ""Why Look at the Moon"" and ""Holy Spirit"" serving as highlights. Vic's songs have an innocence and sincerity that is so lacking in today's popular music. Just like all the great pleasures in life, her voice is an acquired taste; but once it sinks in, you'll begin to crave it!"
1,Not impressed at all...,"Bought the album for the song tribute to 9/11, but should have left it on the shelf. Despite beautiful lyrics, her voice lacked control and depth. There was not cohesion between her voice and the male voice and I found it just not very good at all. I'll leave folk music to people who think it's good music."
3,No texts at all!,"As another reviewer commented, the performances and recordings are very good. However you are getting a Naxos reissue of the original Marco Polo release. This means that you do not get the original CD booklet of the Marco Polo release ... instead you get absolutely nothing besides the original artwork on the booklet's cover. So if you wish to know something about the composers or the compositions, you will have to look elsewhere. The two compositions involve orchestra, chorus, and vocalists, with the latter two singing in Swedish. Thus zero commentary means a lack of original Swedish texts and their translations. This is distressing, but I suppose one could listen to the pieces purely as abstract sound structures ignoring the fact that the vocalized words have meaning. If one goes to Naxos' website, one simply finds ""Distribution Note(s): Currently not available on CD"". Those who care about such things should look for a used copy of the original Marco Polo release."
5,Morning Rituals,"I am an elementary school teacher. Byrd Baylor has helped me teach reading, and loving to read, to first through fourth grades. It seems the more reluctant readers are most easily hooked!Each school morning in September, I read The Way To Start A Day to my class. By the end of September, children are saying the words with me. Soon, kids volunteer to read the book, alone, or in pairs, depending on their abilities.The children take extra copies from the classroom book baskets, and read them to their families. They are surprised at how many of the words they can read. But the book has become so familiar to them, it doesn't surprise me at all!The Way To Start A Day flies off the school library shelves, and Byrd Baylor becomes a favorite author to my students. They innovate on the text, writing stories, poems, picture books, and more.Peter Parnall's illustrations are as captivating as Baylor's lyrical text, and as fascinating to children as ""Where's Waldo?""!I love this book!"
1,Gained a minute a day,"I used to own this Seiko Black Monster. It really was a looker of a watch. Good craftsmanship, durable case and bracelet, and very bright luminous markers. It had good waterproofing too. But when it started to gain at least a minute a day, and stopped on me for a couple of hours, like another owner's experience, I just had to avail of Amazon's excellent return policy. (Thank you so much Amazon.com, I will always remain your loyal customer)."
3,"Loses time, stayed dry","Not sure if this is the ""real"" thing or not. Husband was suspicious. Looked pretty good. Stayed dry after diving fir two weeks.Just like the review, it loses time. What is that about?"
1,I'll make a fair exchange first,"First of all, I am not a kid but an adult who wants to share my thoughts here. I dont want to post my name as some individuals are so fanatic about this watch (get a life, dudes!) that they would skin me alive if I said bad things about it. I owned the Seiko Black Monster for about a month and was surprised when its hour, minute and second hands froze on about four separate occasions, even though I shook it from side to side in attempts to revive it. It activated itself again on these occasions anywhere after between twenty minutes to three hours. But I will not pass judgement on the watch yet, as it could be a bum unit just like other watch brands have theirs. What I can say right now in all fairness is that this is the first time an automatic watch failed me, and I've owned many and I mean many. I will, for now, be returning this Seiko for a fair exchange of the same kind, and will see what happens with the replacement."
1,vendor price too good to be true-beware,"if price is too good to be true, it most often is - even from an amazon listed vendor's deal offering this watch at $23.97. if an item is priced & listed here & order isn't fulfilled by an affiliate vendor, amazon should require them to make good on the price. regardless, if a vendor cancels an order, amazon should allow account members to make vendor comments. vendor comments are not an option to choose if the order doesn't fulfill! order wasn't canceled by the mister company(trying not to name them here) until 5 days after placed & i suspected the price as a leader/come on. i ordered it anyhow & am disappointed not to receive this watch nor an offer from the company to make it right."
1,Fairness please,I just returned my Seiko Black Monster because its hands stopped moving but that's all Im going to say. I appeal to all parties to please desist from giving immature rants (as well as comments). Just give your honest opinion or experience and leave it at that.
1,Did not function as designed...,"This was an automatic watch. I performed all start-up procedures as directed in the manual, and wore the watch all day, even on a 5K run. In the morning I put on the watch, and noticed that it had lost more than five hours. I corrected the time, wore it for an hour, then put it on my dresser. It lost 2 hours over a six hour period. I will not buy another Seiko. In fact, any watch priced under $500 is probably a failure waiting to happen. I have a box containing 4 Traser watches, all broken, or failing to keep proper time, all bought for between $200-$350. Lots of high speed energy put into the look (of the watch) and the advertising, but quality of product is very low. Bad Form..."
5,Time As Chunk of Metal,"If memory serves me right this divers' watch is 45-46mm across. With rubber strap it still weighs a lot, being solid stainless steel. Automatic, don't need to change batteries. Weekday/day of month. Second hand. The luminous dial is that--hold it under sunlight or fluorescent light for 5 min. and big hour indices and hands will glow in the dark for six hours. Movement runs a little fast and may need to be reset once a week. No problem. People I would rather not will try to estimate it's cost.It is an impressive chunk of metal. This is a REAL dive watch. 200 meters."
2,Wrong Version Received,Ordered the stainless steel bracelet version but received the rubber diving band version. I decided to keep it and so far it has performed correctly on my watch winder and on the wrist.It is running about 15 seconds per day fast so far which seems to be typical of Seiko automatic wind mechanical watches. For some reason mechanical watch manufacturers seem to favor running fast to running slow.
3,Seiko Men's Watch,"The watch is running about 4 min. fast per day. Has to be reset every day. If left that way it continues to speed up. Running fast. Is there any setting for this or do we need a replacement?Reg: Seiko Men's ""Black Monster"" Sutomatic Dive Watch #SKX7779K3"
5,IT'S THE BLACK MONSTER,"We need a review for this?? NOT, this watch is da-bomb. Durable, low price, looks great, runs great, yada yada yada. Just buy one, you know you want to, and you won't be disappointed."
2,ran good before 1.5 year mark,"i bought mine abut 1.5 years ago, and two days ago the watch started to have problem, now it run about 2 or 4 hours fast per day..cannot use it anymore.have to return it and the repair website from amazon does not work. have to call them Monday and see how it goes.update: i called this morning and was told to send this watch to ""swinford jewelers"" for repair, and surely i will pay the shipping."
4,everything great but the bracelet pins,"Great, durable attractive watch, great dark viewing, but the bracelet's pin and sleeve system is a large pain and may prove to be unreliable since the pins can poke out a little sometimes. I push 'em back in, knowing there could be a failure ahead. Otherwise very attractive and sturdy. Tough to size by yourself, much better to be done at a shop. It deserves the superior Rolex screw-type assembly. Or just have an alternate diving band for safety since the watch will probably last forever!"
4,Awesome Seiko,"This watch is a pretty nice watch for the money I spent.Only thing I dont like about it is that if you dont wear it for 2 days or so it will stop working,losing all time and you have to reset the date.Otherwise it looks great,and it is made really well.It weighes twice as much as most watches(built like a tank)Well worth the cash I spent."
1,NO WARRANTY AT ALL,LOOKED GOOD ON ME THIS WATCH BUT I FOUND OUT JUST IN TIME THAT THIS DID NOT CARRY SEIKO'S REGULAR TWO OR THREE YEAR WARRANTY SINCE IT IS A GREY MARKET WATCH. HAVING READ THE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SEIKO MONSTER I DECIDED I NEEDED A WARRANTY. SO FOR THIS SIMPLE REASON I HAD TO RETURN IT TO AMAZON RIGHT AWAY AND AM IN THE PROCESS OF EXCHNAGING IT WITH ANOTHER BRAND THAT DOES HAVE WARRANTY.
1,observations,got the watch Friday in the mail it looks cool and nice and teh band is shiny. The number lines glow nicely in the dark. I willoberserve the watch and come back in a month to say my opinions.
5,Unbelievable,"Just got this watch yesterday after much research...i am amazed by the quality, fit and finish of this watch...i recommend getting one asap. At $159 (or even the retail $375) this is a steal....the stainless steel polished and brushed band is worth the price of admission alone. I cant wait to dive with it. Well done Seiko!!!"
4,Black monster Seiko,"The watch is indestructible. But as someone else has suggested, I should have bought the steel belted one, with a rubber strap as a replacement... The watch keeps a few mins plus/minus per month... Solid. Buy it if you like the image, the watch is better in real life. I prefer it over the rubber strapped one I got earlier...Just got time to update from Jan 2008- the resin-silicone band gave way while on the wrist. An embarrassment of sorts to have the watch drop like that. Anyway, this just re-affirms that the steel belt is THE way to go. And for all the tricks that the Citizen (reviewed elsewhere) this watch remains my number one pet."
2,Runs fast. Way fast.,"I was really excited to get this watch, and have seen lots of really good things written about it. My first automatic, very excited when it came Friday.Sadly, the watch is not useful. It runs 7 seconds fast, for every minute. Not day or week, but every minute. Will try to find a way to send it back to Seiko, but this is a big disappointment.Otherwise, the appearance and feel of the watch are great, although the black rubber band doesn't balance out the heft of the watch itself. The steel band would be better for this, but I liked the more casual look of the black rubber band."
5,Black Monster is true to it's name.,"This is a great watch. The look is tremendous, bold and perfect for my lifestyle.It is a rugged sport watch that feels solid and substantial on the wrist. The machining is first rate, from the screw-down crown to the smooth turning bezel.The band on mine is very long, but very comfortable on my wrist.Accuracy... not so great, but not horrible either. It gains about 5 sec / day, but I've only had it a few days. We'll see..."
2,Keeps bad Time,"For the first few months, it was a great watch. soon after, it began to jump and lose time, depending on how active I was. I sent it in once, and they replaced the movement, it was good for a while afterward, but now does the same thing."
3,SIEKO DIVE WATCH MONSTER,"GREAT WATCH IN EVERY REPECT, IT BEING AUTOMATIC -- IT WILL GAIN ABOUT 5 MINUTES PER MONTH, AS ALL AUTOMATICS DO. IF YOU CAN LIVE WITH THE IDEA OF CONSTANTLY SETTING TIME-PIECE, OK TO BUY. IF YOU WOULD LIKE SPLIT SECOND TIME--BUY A QUARTZ, THIS SEIKO WILL NOT GIVE YOU SPLIT SECOND TIME!!"
1,Broken on Delivery,"Very disappointed in the watch and Amazon. The day/date did not work on delivery but I was unaware of it until the end of February when I tried to manually change the date. I found that it was broken at that time, about a week after I received the watch. The day/date did change automatically each night. Amazon refused t orepalce it because I had the band adjusted. Seiko refused t oreplace it but said they would repair it and have it back to me in 3-4 weeks! Had I purchased it from a REPUTABLE local store I could have exchanged it for a new watch."
1,Incorrect Specifications,"Very nice watch. However, please watch out incorrect specfications this adds was previuosly posted JAPANESE MOVEMENT. I returned 2 deliveries still ""MALAYSIAN MOVEMENT"" received. But they have changed and fixed add to ""AUTOMATIC"" now.Thanks!"
2,shake it like a can of paint,"I have had this watch for about 4 months. If you don't have a job operating a jack hammer it will probably run itself down. I am very disappointed in the watch. It was not cheap. I paid about $200. for it and I expected better. I am one of those people that never take my watch off and it still winds down and stops. I made a big deal about this watch with my wife, and now I get a lot of grief when I complain about it. It is sturdy, having hit the wall several times."
2,Save your money,"Save your money on this one, friends. This is the third Seiko that I own right now (the second diver), and it is just like the other two--nice looking in the daytime, but if you want to read it during the night hours, you are going to need a flashlight. I was sincerely hoping this one would be different with all of the hype about the greatly improved luminescence, but it is not. The pictures of this watch's bright luminescence that are on the internet had to be taken right after the watch was exposed to a light source. It is not that bright otherwise. If you just want to wear it in the daytime, it is a great looking watch. If you want one you can read at night, buy a Luminox. I have two of those diver watches, and they remain bright all night long."
3,good looking watch,"this watch looks very nice but, it is heavy and it does stop in the middle of the night if you happen to take it off your wrist a little early in the evening. remember, if the watch doesn't move, it doesn't get wound up. if it was 2/3 less on the cost i would of kept it."
2,huge watch,"i did not expect this watch to be so b-i-g! shiny, giant sized, and heavy. if that's what you want-then it's for you. i consider myself of medium height/weight and this timepiece appears to be built for a very big person."
2,A word of caution,"I'm sure I'm like a lot of you, this isn't my only watch. The trouble I have with this watch is the very short memory of the self-winding system. If I take the watch off and set it on the dresser while I sleep, the self-winder runs out and I have to re-set the watch in the morning.If I decide to wear another watch for a day, needless to say I have to re-set this watch when I want to wear it next.Call me lazy, but it gets to be a hassle for living day to day with this watch."
3,"Grey Market Watch... Nice, but...","After months of saving, I finally decided to purchase a Seiko Black monster watch. Imagine my surprise when what I received from AMAZON of all places was a watch that was not meant to be sold in the USA. I still like the watch, but wish that the listing spelled out a little better that the watch I would be receiving was not sold through 'official' Seiko channels."
3,"Very small, yet solid","As soon as I opened the box I was going to send this watch back, it is a solid piece but is very small in size. I don't know where the word ""monster"" comes from in the title. Yes it is well designed, but if your looking for a large face watch, this is not it. I don't know why so many commented on how big this was. The watch band is very narrow and thin, not very wide, looks almost like women's band. The band should be wide and thick, not so narrow. These are only my opinions towards the watch. It's just to small, I am now selling mine. Thanks for your time!"
1,BAD MANUFACTURING BAD FAITH FROM AMAZON,"Looks cool. Stopped working after 3 months.Amazon said we'll ship you a new one,then said you gotta ship it to us, then said it's offour warranty.Buyer beware."
3,Smaller than Expected,"As a dive watch aficianado, I was happy to purchase the ""iconic"" Seiko Black Monster, a model that I understand is no longer produced by Seiko. The vast majority of the dive watches I own have case diameters of 44-51mm, and are 14-18mm,thick. So, according to the spec sheet listed on Amazon, I expected a watch with a case diameter of 47mm by 13mm. Well, they got it half-right--the watch is 13mm thick but is actually 42mm wide by 47mm tall, so not truly a false measurement per se; Compared to most of my other watches, this is actually a small diver, so, if anyone really likes the big beefy divers, you might find this watch a bit undersized. Otherwise, the watch is as advertised and, let's face it, Amazon offers a great deal on this watch."
5,unbelievable watch,"This is the definitive man's watch. Whether you need it for diving or not, it looks mucho macho on your wrist. There's no way your going to get an equal quality watch for under $1000. The extra nice thing is that it's automatic. No breaking the gasket (effecting its waterproofness) because of it needing a new battery. I never write reviews for anything so save yourself a bundle of money. This one will put a smile on your face. Wish I bought two!"
4,Big Watch,What a great price for this watch! Its big and has heft to it. Impressive braclet and clasp. Solid. I would buy this watch again.
5,Outstanding,"Regarding I am currently in Africa, and all my orders have been delivered via P.O. Box in NY City, I am more than satisfied. Moreover, all the purchases I made, but one, Kingston memory, were delivered on time, with no problems at all regarding the state of product, package, etc. That's the way how to do the job. I will continue to be your customer because of your full profesionalism.Best regards.Mario Sebetovsky"
5,Best Bang For Buck Automatic Watch,"This Seiko Black Monster dive watch is a fantastic value. If you need/want an automatic (non-quartz) dive watch you CANNOT go wrong with this watch. It's very well made with a quality solid stainless steele band with a locking clasp. This watch should be priced at $300+, it's a real bargin."
3,Seiko Monster,The first watch I received had defective pins holding the links together. This type watch has barrels on the end of the pins that are a compression type fitting. Amazon sent me a new one overnite but the watch was broken! I swapped out the bands and so far so good. The flourescent glow is amazing on the dial. It is still faintly glowing after 7 hours of being in the dark. I bought it for daily wear and also for scuba diving. Have to wait a month to see how it works underwater.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this video. The video was about 95% videos of kids skiing to a music soundtrack and 5% actual instructions. The kids read a scripted line or two about how to turn and then you watch a bunch of kids just skiing. I was looking for much more instruction and explanation. This is the the video equivalent of taking a ski lesson from an amateur kid rather than a professional instructor. If you would rather have your kids learn from a professional instructor, then I would not recommend the ""by kids"" instructional video. My fault for buying this -- the video is as advertised. I'm not sure why I thought ski instructions from 8-year olds would be very good....live and learn...."
3,Seems rushed,"I like this product and I like the whole concept. Where it falls short is in the amount of actual instruction, drills and tips. It does a great job of showing fine form and the kids are very impressive & likeable. Things that I have always used to teach people to ski (Keeping shoulders square to the hill, Pretend you're carrying two pitchers of beer (or rootbeer considering the audience), Always be turning, Ski in control, letting legs shift for stability in hockey stops, Keep your eyes on the top of the hill in a herringbone climb, unweighting) were either not discussed or breezed over.Maybe it needs to contrast bad form with the good form.More inspirational than instructional."
5,Exellant book,"After reading this book ourselves, we bought a copy for one of our sons who had traveled through Norway and camped above the Artic Circle. We bought another copy for a friend from Denmark. They both enjoyed the books very much, as did we."
5,Canonical is correct,"I would like to address the comment made ""jcd from Cleveland, Ohio"". The comments made regarding the canonical description, etc.. were incorrect. The definition provided in the book is correct per RFC 2469 Canonical Ordering Of Link-Layer Addresses. I would refer him to this RFC for future reference."
2,Not enough to pass!!,"I bought this book with high expectations having used Exam Cram's before, during my CCNP testing. I'm sad to say this book was not up to par with the other Exam Cram books I've bought in the past. This book alone will not even get you close to passing the exam, it's missing a lot of detail information that you need to pass the exam. It covers general information but is no where near in depth enough. I bought this book after my 1st attempt hoping to find answers to questions and they just simply were not there. I suggest using the CCIE prep Kit, Jeff Doyles book, and most important CCO. Using all of those resources got me by on my 2nd attempt with a 10pt increase in my score. Good Luck"
1,quite a few errors,This book wasn't nearly deep enough for the CCIE written. It was also full of errors. Stick to the CCIE reading list.
2,Just a Brush Stroke,"This is a fine book for light reading on the train, but this is merely brush stroke of information you'll need to know. If that's what the authors intended, then they did a very good job. I give it 2 stars because I'm simply not referring to it anymore after the first go-around.Purchase this book to find your glaring weaknesses. What I mean by that is, if you read something in this book you don't understand, it means you really have a problem with the concept and you need to dig much deeper in another book."
3,Many errors on instructions for reading RIFs,Specifically regarding explorer frame types in key and narrative example.
3,A Glimpse of the Universe,"It gives you an glimpse of what you will need to know. It's a great book to read when you first start studying, because if a concept is new to you, you can dig deeper in another book. If you have this book side-by-side with a much larger and more detailed text, you will pass the exam. I suggest Swartz for the ""other"" book.Why only 3 stars? Because it's just filler for other texts. A starting point to guide you to other authors. For that reason alone, I can't give it 4 stars (Swartz gets 4 stars).I passed the Exam today and I can say that this book assisted. I believe I would have passed without it, but my score was probably bumped a few points because of it. If you are borderline, it could make the difference between a Pass/Fail.The final 100 question exam is excellent! They explain the answers in detail. If you can get a 90% or above on the final 100 questions, you've got a shot."
3,Good Investment,I just passed the CCIE written exam yesterday by a small margin. This is the only book I use to prepare ( read four times in a month) and it has more than enough information to make a pass only if you understand the topic by heart and have a lot of experience. This is a good investment. There are quite a few errors.
2,Nice idea but many mistakes,"This book is a nice idea but there are many mistakes in it. Definitions on canonical verses non-canonical, MTU of Token Ring, etc."
3,Use to Cross-Reference,The book is a guick read as the title suggests (EXAM CRAM). I gave it a 3 because it forces one to cross reference (not because of the content per se) since it contains unfortunate errors in a number of places. And this is a good thing. If one has studied this text (in a negative-postive twist) keeps you on your toes. As a cram it is fine. If this is your sole text you will get hosed. Cross-reference much and see if you can spot the errors. I'm sure this is more a publishing thing than the oversight of the authors.
2,Finishing off The Study,"Good overall book for finishing off the studying for the CCIE written. I passed the written on the first go. However, there are quite a few typos, some misc fact errors and the sample test/questions don't reflect what is actually on the test (way to easy). Would definitely review the CCIE TCP/IP Vol. I&II and CCIE Switching books, especially focusing on the review questions - not multiple choice but fill in the blank. The bottom line ... Don't expect to pass the written exam if this is your only source of knowledge/experience."
3,I give it an upgrade to 3 Stars!!,"Initially I slated it for 2 stars, because I didn't feel the material was very meaty. I know it's supposed to be a Cram, but sorry, it just didn't have what I was looking for. The more I studied, the less I referenced this book.BUT, now, on the night before my exam, I'm taking the 100 question test in the back of the book and I'm impressed with it. The questions seem to be on the mark and challenging.You get an upgrade! 3 Stars!"
5,Viva le Tat,"It's all been said before by other 5-star reviewers...and I crave other comics from Tatsuya Ishida - he is very good, too good for syndication, even!"
2,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap","Like the others, there were dents all over, even though the box looked in good shape. It was just packaged with dents! I had looked at Sears, and home depot for similar carts and the quality I saw didn't justify the price. After reading the reviews here I expected more. I didn't get it!The drawers do work fairly well, and after a few drops of 3&1 oil, even better. But the Hinges of the Chest lid are so stiff (and cheap) that you have to hold the chest while opening. AND, there isn't any place to grab the lid to open it. Have to grab both sides of it!All in all, you get what you pay for I guess. It will serve it's purpose which was to just orginize what tools I keep in the basement and not have to run out to the garage."
1,guess what ... dents,"After reading the other reviews, I thought I'd take the gamble. Guess what? It came dented and unusable.No worries, Amazon are going to send someone to pick it up and take it back so I'm only out 10 min of my time."
4,Very cheaply made,"If you're looking for a tool chest that is cheap, this is the one. It is affordable, and fine for light use."
1,Tool Box Crushed,I received this tool box caved in on the bottom. Returned it with no problems and re-ordered a new one. Recieved the new tool box and it was worse then the one before. So returned this also and ordered a complete different box. Let's see how the next box comes.
3,how can you go wrong?,"Your buying a cheap tool box. It is what it is, but, that is not to say, it is what it is. Its a tool box. Drawers work, easy assembly, has keys. Rubber mats were included for drawers. Take the top box off, and you've got a roll bench. Wheels ""so-so"". Its smaller then picture suggests. But for the money, it has it's place. Will keep tools sorted, 5 drawers, big open bottom bay. If you were a professional, this is not the box for you. If your the ""I've got some tools, but this is....."". it works, and really well. For the weekender, this is great box. Change your oil, drain the boat, put spark plugs in the mower, this box will hold than and more. Good bang for the buck. If you want a nice one, pay more. If your into, every once and a while, good choice."
1,Disappointment,Product is very poorly designed and one of those get what you pay for items. the sheet metal that makes up this unsturdy hunk-of-junk is so THIN it barely keeps the toolbox in shape as you wheel it anywhere! THERE IS NO LOCKING MECHANISM FOR THE CABINET the only reason I was getting a toolbox. Not to mention the toolbox came out of UPS' hands like it was thrown around the truck and the driver hit ever pothole/manhole around! It's poor design and paint-job make it one of the few disappointments ever bought online. Maybe the handler could package this item with a little more logic to UPS' demising driving.
1,Cheap Piece of St**l,"What a cheap piece of steel. Got this for my birthday, but with life happening, I didn't get a chance to put it together for a long while. When I tried to unseat the bottom floorplate so I could take out the top box, I couldn't even move it. The box had been so mishandled during shipping, and the steel was so cheap, that the weight of the top box in the main compartment had bent the floorplate and the bottom of the large doorframe to the point I couldn't get the floorplate out without mangling it all to crap. The top box will be useable, but the bottom half is a lost cause. My fault for not putting it together right away. DO NOT BUY THIS."
3,fun,a solid 6 out of 10 worth watching could beI could not find this anyplace to rent so I pu a copy wellbetter then the SNL movie Pat for sure
5,Great for Teachers and Poetry Lovers Everywhere,"This books is a great introduction to slam poetry (on the page)! I use this in my English 103 class to spark class discussions about how poetry can make an argument. The students really connect with these young, hip, and contemporary poets.But on a personal level, I love it because the book contains such a wonderful cross section of poetic voices, styles, and subjects. What could be better than so many slam greats in one book: Danny Solis, Corbet Dean, Buddy Wakefield, Ray McNiece and many more!I also recommend the National Poetry Slam DVD's at www.poetryslam.com."
2,Disapointed! No light when you open door???,Returned it after 2 days! Can you believe that the inside light only works when it is cooking? It only informs you of this in the product manual after reading. We also didnt pay attention to the cubic size only the add that call it a family size microwave :( 1.2 CF is very small and no light after opening door is crazy. There are many better choices.
3,Not as expected,"Order this product and received in timely basis. I have some problem with the description of the product. In the description it says the capacity is 50/550 [line size/yard capacity], it did not mention if the measurement is base on mono or braided line. Once I saw it I know there is no way 550 yard will fit in this even braided. On the reel itself when I carefully inspect it, it's line capacity is [in max] only 20/300 in mono. So, thinking to make sure I load it with fifty pound test braided line. And there it is, in less than 200 yards of 50lb test braided line it's full. I'm not that happy with this product though the construction is good I bought this because I'm looking for a reel that has more line capacity for giant sea bass in deeper water expecting with at least some extra line in the reel before sinker hit the bottom."
5,Excellent resource!,"No parent OR special education teacher should be without this book! Easy to read, and the content is excellent! Step-by-step approaches to teaching everyday skills to children with special needs, but would be just as valuable to ANY parent! After reading this book, I have found it easier to establish goals for my students and everyone is using the same approach to teaching everyday living skills (play, toileting, self-help, PLUS behavior management)! It is working fabulous! The students are learning more with less frustration! A must-have for your resource library!"
3,behaviorist model of teaching,I do find this book helpful and it breaks many tasks down into manageable steps. It is comprehensive and easy to read. Be aware that the book uses a behaviorist model of teaching / training and rewards are an integral part of the teaching method. Those who are troubled by this approach may find the book less helpful. The book (as do most in the field) also assumes that the child is in a school or intervention program and does not address the somewhat differing needs of children who are homeschooled or receiving all their therapies at home.
2,Wrong size,The ladies 9.5-11 size was way too big. It would fit was a man's size 11 shoe. The Tingley rubbers was correctly sized.
2,slow and almost pointless,"Subtitles were showing up late and at dfferent parts of the film. Sometimes no subtitles at all. I speak Turkish, so no big deal for me, but very annoying anyhow. The whole film was tiring. Only good thing was that it was short, 1.5hrs. Personally, I felt it was a failed attempt at making a Turkish art-house type film."
3,Gypsy Blood,"I read both of the reviews (the only two reviews that were posted) before I bought the DVD. The picture seemed alright.If you go on youtube and try to watch it, it looks very blurry, but if you buy the DVD you can easily see the difference in visuality. I could make out everything. It was alright for a silent film made in 1918. The person on the first review who spoke about the visuality might have been talking about youtube or some other DVD version. The movie is good and if you like the story of Carmen you will enjoy it."
4,"Poser 6, it's about time","Finally, I can step up from Poser 4 ProPack without the constant fear of crashing. Poser 6, compared to Poser 5, has run consistantly stable without a crash. (I did have to update my graphics card drivers, but that's usually expected with new software)Now that I can start enjoying many of the options introduced in Poser 5, my artwork can start to be more vibrant. Granted I'm behind the masses that updated to Poser 5 (to which I was a contributing artist on the content cd), but I always had problems with program crashing.I've found Poser to be very easy to learn, and a quick fix for the artist that needs faster results then creating everything in 3d from scratch. Of course you still can adapt your original work to Poser, and Poser 6 makes it even easier with more options to do so.Poser 6 may not be for the beginner to 3d, but there is a large poser community ready to help you along."
1,Needs improvement.,This release proved to be good on more new features but the memory issues are the stinker. Renders stop with to many out of memory issues at the simplest settings no matter how much RAM you feed it. As of this moment the latest service pack release SR2 has not solved the memory issue.
1,Great possibilities - very unstable,"When I first got Poser 6 I was excited about the possibilities of porting Poser animations to Flash. Poser may work fine as a tool for creating static figures, but the animation aspect is extremely unstable to the point of unusable.Poser 6 crashes often and crashes hard when rendering animations. It actually crashed and re-booted my computer several times!!! I kept trying because the potential is so great. I even bought more memory hoping that would fix the problem. I'm using an AMD Athlon 2.16 Ghz CPU and 1 Gig of RAM. That's more than double what Curoious Labs says Poser requires - so it's not lack of computing firepower.Such potential... unfortunately Poser is not ready yet."
4,Low Budget - Originality - Horror Fun!,"From the guy that brought you Puppet Monster Massacre, has now given us another fun adventure.With Zombies being a pretty big deal lately, it's nice to see a story that although has some elements we've seen in other movies, is a whole new take on anything you've ever seen involving Zombies.Now keep in mind that this is the lowest of budgets you can get while still delivering a good looking movie with even better special effects.This movie is perfect for a Grindhouse setting and in my opinion, a great Double Feature, companion piece for a film like Dead Hooker in a Trunk."
3,"Goes down easy, leaves no trace","Truffaz marries electric-era Miles Davis with a more ambient, Jon Hassell-style of playing to come up with a CD that, if hardly a contender for intellectual experience of the year, can certainly be an entertaining listen at times. Often the trumpet and keyboards are so heavily processed you can't tell what's what, which is fine because it all makes a grand noise on the CD's rockier cuts. The slower numbers are pretty much all of a piece, with plenty of fine brooding atmosphere without being truly memorable. All of it will leave your brain wrinkle-free and can help pass some of the time on those longer road trips."
4,An Album,"More and more of today's artist (jazz cats included) are releasing records that are merely collections of songs. I suppose the extended length of the CD compared to the LP, as well as the ability to access any track has contributed negatively. But Truffaz and co release albums.The songs will stand alone, but this is best taken as a single musical dose. It flows from one track to the next bringing the listener straight to the end of the disc.It's more fusion/electric/acid than traditional jazz, somewhat in the style of moderately late Miles. Is it good? I like it. it keeps me on my listening toes (ear toes, perhaps) from start to finish. it is not background music, but why buy a CD for background music. that's what the radio's for."
4,"It was geat; however, the ending could have been better.","This was a great novel I liked it alot. I wonder though why the ending was not done better. It seemed that the author was in a hurry and needed something to finish it. Thank God; however, the author brought back Dire McCann at the end."
3,A little too raw,"This book was a little too raw for me - not raw in the subject matter, but in the actual text. It's 850 pages of raw transcripts of one on one conversations and letters between the author and several different prisoners.It left me with the impression of an author that did the research for a book, but then never actually wrote it, instead releasing the research as-is. What I felt myself wanting more of was relating the opinion of one prisoner with the others. It would have been more informative as a reader for the author to cover one topic at a time: Processing, the Convict Code, Life After Release, etc, and draw on the correspondence for specific examples.That said, the book was readable, and almost humorous when he kept asking how someone that had never commited a crime (perhaps referring to himself?) can survive in prison. (Answer: Eat ramen and never leave your cell.)"
5,TOTTALY BONA!,"This is just wicked in a nice sense,I have all E Nomines recordinds and even treated myself to the new album in the ltd pack with the dvd and believe me it`s great I am lucky as I do speak some german the album opens with the beginning from the bible into vater unser(the lords prayer)into this track a little different on the album from the single release and also called e-nomine(pontis piletus)!.All I will says is if you like Enigma Deep forest ambient-house you can`t go wrong with this,by the way the new album finsternis is based on horror storys there`s one track thats as camp as they come about Freddie Kruger from nightmare on elmstreet!!."
3,Not What I Had Expected,"This book was alright, but not what I had expected from seeing the other reviews. I found it to be somewhat shallow and lacking in detail. Mostly just repetitions of old newspaper and/or historical society articles. Not that much research done by the author. It is more a thumbnail sketch of a few of the events which reportedly took place in Tallahassee over the years."
5,amazing book!,i've read this book over and over for about five years. i'm still on my journey to embracing all that is wonderful about me as a black woman and this book is so supportive and insightful! i know i'm not alone and I KNOW i'm beautiful!!!
5,The Apple's Best So Far!,"The Apples (in stereo) although little known, are one of the great bands of the last ten years. They have now had two masterpieces. Their first is 1994's Fun Trick Noisemaker. Up till 2000, the Apples had not equalled this album. The question was, Could They. They have, with The Discovery Of A World Inside The Moone, surpassed their first great achievemnet. If you know nothing of the Apples' music, they are a very intelligent band with complex rock/pop songs. I could easily see the songs Go, The Rainbow or The Bird That You Can't See becoming hit songs. Hopefully more people will be exposed to the great music of the Apples."
5,the best abbott and costello book out there,"this book is for all abbott and costello fans out there that love thier routines. With classic routins such as ""sesquahana hat company' and ""who's on first"". The routines along with pictures are taken right from thier movies such as ""Buck privates"" ""Hit the ice"" ""Keep 'em flyin"" and many many more. The pictures bring just as much laughs as the routines.This book really captures thier personality in thier movies. I gladly give this book 5 stars"
4,It captures the comedy of Abbott and Costello as well as print media ever could,"Abbott and Costello were a comedy team for their times but their brand of humor has not worn well over the ages. Much of what they did was based on wordplay and puns and modern comedy has a much harsher tone. Slapstick was also a fundamental component of their routines and that brand of humor has also gone out of favor.Using still photos and captions from their movies, this book is designed to capture the essence of the unique humor of Abbott and Costello. It is hard to capture the complete experience in a sequence of stills, so it is a weak substitute. Their routines relied on timing, facial expressions, body movements and voice inflection, which obviously cannot be delivered in this manner. Nevertheless, if you are a fan of Abbott and Costello, you will enjoy the book as you can see some of the comedic personalities and genius of both men."
5,Great book,"This is a fantasic book like all the other ones from the dummies series, it has fantasic diagrams, HEAPS of infomation even though it doesnt have a CD its just as good without it.The book teaches everything for an BEGIN to INTER level. Many tutorails and design info.Buy this good! HIGHLY recomended."
4,Awesome Beginner's Guide !!!,"This is a great book to get started with LiveMotion. They use real-world examples, and put everything into clear language. There's none of the typical jargon to deal with, and everything is presented in the context of getting something accomplished. I wish they had more and better information on working with sound, otherwise they cover everything in the program. A great way to get started with this incredible animation program. There's no CD, which is why I took off one star, but the book easily makes up for it in it's easy step-by-step instructions."
2,Kill Creek - 'Stretch' (Mammoth),"'Strech' is the Lawrence,Kansas band's second release,actually it's a five-song EP.Never understood what the big deal about Kill Creek was ever about.Seems like I had at least one other of their CD's a year or so later.This band just didn't do it for me.Oh,the playing is tight,I give them that much.The tunes ""Fruit Pie"" and ""Inside"" are even decent to listen to.Just nothing I'd even consider a keeper.Take a chance if you feel like it.You may get more out of it than I did.Just might appeal to some fans of Dinosaur Jr,Jawbreaker and possibly Husker Du."
2,Hmm...,"-1 inch pots are so tiny, the pots are also plastic-Ordered 2 sets of 8 and only received 2 cacti, the rest were succulents. Would have liked a more even distribution.-The plants were each about the size of a quarter, not grown like the pictures.-Really didn't look much like the picture at all-Overall the succulents were cute but the cacti looked like they were in rough shape-If you want to be able to look at your plants without squinting this might not be for you-The tape they used to attempt to keep the sand/stones in the little pots just gathered all the sand to stick to it. By the time I pulled the tape off there was almost nothing left in the pots.-Overall a cute product but wasn't what I expected, I'll be returning them"
5,Instant Cactus Plants,Bought these as a gift for my family as Christmas gifts. They really liked them and they require little space! Would buy from again!
2,Great story - not a great book,The story of Richard Etheridge is fascinating and inspiring. It is unfortunate that its telling here is tedious and uneven.
1,"Should be"" Wild's African Brigade Revised""","The book purports to tell the story of Richard Etheridge but the first third is about ""Wilds African Brigade,"" a black brigade that committed murder, arson, looting and the hostage taking of white women in Tidewater North Carolina and Virginia in October and December 1863.On its return to base in Portsmouth Virginia Brigadier General Wild was relieved of command and the brigade disbanded."
3,Rather disappointing,"The liner notes are very useful (interesting to learn that Schoolhouse Rock mastermind Bob Dorough shared the lead vocal on ""Without Rhyme Or Reason,""), and the cover photos are great, but why is there a picture of the 1975 reunion band included inside! I have to agree that ""Byrd Avenue"" and ""Three Ways From Tomorrow"" are sorely missed - and how in the world can you omit ""Commercial"" from any Spanky and Our Gang CD compilation! It's nice to have ""Stardust"" and ""Anything You Choose,"" but where are ""5 Definitions Of Love,"" ""My Bill,"" ""Leopard Skin Phones,"" ""Jane,"" and ""Since You've Gone?"" These (among others), I feel, would have been better choices than some of the other newly-included songs. I also agree that the remastering isn't that special. Perhaps the Japanese reissues of the original albums are the only way to go."
4,Great sixties pop-rock!,"Featuring the gorgeous, powerful singing of Spanky McFarlane, (Why do women singers now sound so wimpy?) Spanky and Our Gang had a great sound and some great songs. Sunday Will Never Be The Same, Lazy Day, Sunday Mornin' and Like To Get To Know You are true gems from the sixties."
5,Great Service,This vendor delivered as promised and on time! Well worth dealing with this vendor. Will do business again!
3,Purchased album for pop hits,"I purchased the album to hear their most popular hits. It was nice to hear ""Sunday Mornin'"". I heard it on an FM station once and loved it. However, I did not particularly care for Spanky's rendition of Depression era tunes. I would like to have heard more songs from the first and second albums."
4,Pretty good,"Don't let the name or the album cover fool you. I ran across this album on Pandora & pretty much bought it right away. I like the rewriting of the music but, at the some time very recognisable. Especially the track ""Use me"" & ""I feel the earth move"""
4,Good Execution,"An excellent, exhaustive, but fun to read little book which details various execution methods used at different times and places."
4,smart purchase,"I had double knee replacements, and this has been a very handy item for showering/bathing. I feel like the stool is sturdy and safe. I can sit on the edge of the tub, slide back onto the chair, and then turn my body and lift my legs to get in the tub. I have a deep tub, so I let it fill while I ""shower"" and thus get to soak my legs, too. It's also great to use to sit on while at the sink."
5,bath seat,Pleased with the product. Lower price than local and adjustable.Carex Adjustable Bath and Shower Seat
3,Good Bike - needed adjustments,"After some setup adjustments out of the box, my son loves the bike and it works very well. So if you aren't afraid of a little screwdriver and wrench work, you can't beat it for the money. Adjustments needed: Front brake pads, rear derailer, spoke tension on front tire."
4,Good Bike for the Money,"We bought the boy's and girl's bikes for our kids for Christmas, and we are very happy with the bikes. We were looking for an inexpensive mountain bike (< $100 each) for our kids to learn to use hand brakes and gears. We got the pair for just over $150.They required many adjustments on the brakes and gears to make the bikes work properly, but fortunately, I am good friends with a bike mechanic. Also, both inner tubes on one of the bikes had small holes in them - one was found Christmas morning. :(Overall, I would definitely recommend these bikes. They are much better than the ""Walmart Special"" for about the same price."
2,Difficult Brake Adjustment!,"I bought this bike for my 10 year old son instead of a similar one at Wal-mart thinking that it would be a better quality bike. Not the case - overall quality was probably the same but the brake adjustments were very complicated!! The bike went together easily but the brakes were not adjusted correctly (the wheels wouldn't even turn) and it took me 2 hours to just get them to work (and I'm a mechanical engineer!). The front brake assembly is still way too loose and I haven't been able to figure out how to adjust it. If I had bought one at Wal-mart, I would not have had to spend time adjusting anything."
1,what compatibility?,This product is 100% not compatible with windows Vista 64 bit or windows 7. It comes ready for windows XP but you will have to download seperate drivers for a 32 bit vista.I was very disapointed that this was not mentioned anywhere on the ad or even on the box!!
4,Four stars three times,"We run three computers all using Cisco-Linksys Wireless Cards. Two computers running Windows, one running Linux. Works well on all three."
1,"Works, then stops working!",I bought the Linksys Wireless-G 2.4GHZ Model WMP54G Ver.4.1 and am not happy with it at all! The card will work for a while then stop working. Not sure what the problem is with it. I installed the latest driver and firmware and still having problems with it disconnecting from the router etc. I have since removed the card and hard wired my computer with CAT 5e Cable. Working much faster now.
3,OVERPRICED,"After taking it (I had ordered two bottles), I noticed NO discernible difference in my body's function that this was supposed to address."
1,possible old tablets in new bottles,"As I have read in another reviews these tablets have dark spots on them, and it tasted horrible on my tongue. Experation date lists 06-14 L215. From what I understand they should not be spotted and the taste is suppose to be neutral. Going to contact Standard Process about this."
3,Cholacol after GB removal,"After removed gallbladder a fine walk between almost ok, and downright miserable. Bile dumping is one major problem, but also occasional lack of bile causing indigestion, slowdown of intestinal transit time and worst case iletus+dehydration. Suggested dose is 2 tablets, but pill cutter can also be used to make a 1/2 pill dose (175mg). Suggested eating habit: half a bowl of cooked/microwaved veggies last thing before going asleep + cooked ""veggie cereal"" in the morning to combat the bile dumping, the bile produced by the liver while asleep. Benefits of Cholacol: deal with the daytime disturbances that vacation, holidays or travel introduces to diet plans, dealing with more fatty foods and/or larger meals happening at less frequent intervals. Alternative to cholachol: squeezed lemon to jump start digestion, intestine that has ""fallen asleep""."
1,Very Disappointed,"I ordered this product based on the reviews, with the hope to get some relief with my digestive issues after having my gallbladder removed several months ago. However, when I recieved the bottle, the pills did not look fresh and were dark with dark spots on them. I was not happy at the fact that I was unable to return the product because I had opened the bottle. I will not recommend anyone to order these pills from this company. NOT Worth It."
2,5-Star potential,"There are 2 major reasons that this is not a 5-star (or even 4-star) puzzle:#1) the pieces fit together looser than any other puzzle I've assembled (~25 over the last year from all of the major manufacturers). You can't put separate blocks together & then transfer them to their location in the puzzle - they just crumble when you try to pick them up.#2) I needed to use a magnifying glass to look at the tiny pic on the cover of the box, & I still couldn't see it well enough! Buffalo supplies a slightly enlarged print of the pics on their boxes. All puzzle manufacturers should do this, especially when it is a long skinny pic (or change the shape of the box to accommodate a larger pic).Between the loose pieces & the micro-sized pic, this puzzle was a fight from start to finish. The quality of the pic & the pieces themselves (individually) were 5-star.Wouldn't it be great if manufacturers read these reviews & made adjustments accordingly?"
5,beautiful puzzle,Waited a long time to purchase this puzzle. Wanted the 25K one but settled on the 3K piece one. Whole family worked on it over the holidays. It was intermediate in difficulty. Definately recommend!
3,Bubble Wrap,"The seller's processing and timely delivery were awesome. The bubble wrap, however, had a large number of already popped bubbles which made wrapping pictures (my reason for the purchase) impossible. This wrap would be great as package filler and that's what I will use it for but I don't recommend it for wrapping fragile items."
1,Very Disappointed,"This product is very low quality, the plastic is thin and bubbles pop with very little force, lots of them with no force. Also there are no perforations which makes cutting it a total pain. Also there is no dowel in the center (as shown in the photo) to insert in my hanger, this makes unraveling it very annoying."
3,Decent for the price.,"Pros: Good for large, fragile items, like electronics, computers, large framed pictures and kitchen appliances. I can attest to a good price as the same roll cost $30 at a local packaging store.Cons: Many bubbles were popped already on arrival. Generally in a 'band' that permeated throughout the inner layers.I'd still buy it again, but I hope quality improves at some juncture."
2,Information before you buy,"While many (most) of the reviews were glowing, the three newest reviews were very low in stars, and reported a large number of popped bubbles. I emailed the seller to see if they would pay for return shipping or refund me if this happened to me (i.e. I received a defective product). The response was that they wouldn't pay for return shipping, or a refund, but that they inspect it before it leaves. FYI."
4,Dream Catcher by Audrey Osofsky,"This is a story of a day in the life of the Ojibway Indians of the Great Lakes. The story is based on the baby of the tribe, whoses sister weaves a dreamcatcher. A dreamcatcher is a net, which is used to catch bad dreams, holding on to them until sunrise when they will be destroyed. This net was made for the Ojibway baby who watches its family through the day as they work and play, lulled into a restful slumber by the dreamatcher.This is a wonderful story of how this tribe treasured their good dreams as a source of wisdom. It is very captivating for young readers to relate to dreams in this manner, also comparing the games that the children of this culture play. This poetic text uses a rhythm to keep the young reader interested. The beautiful pastel illustrations are used in an impressionistic way to keep the reader in that dream-like feelng."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"After reading Jude's Law, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. It starts out where Jude's Law leaves off and begins with the incredible chemistry between Ashley and Quinton. For those who read JL first will know exactly what I'm talking about when I say that the sparks that fly off Ash and Quinton is----WOW! While it seems that the romance will be as hot as that of Jude's Law, unfortunately, it fizzles into a series of ""huh"" questions. I think sometimes Ashley is a little too brazen, even for her, and it gets to be a bit boring. Moreover, there doesn't seem to be as many page-turning chapters, and I found that I wasn't enjoying the storyline as much. While overall it's a good read, I was expecting a lot more in terms of the book having a page-turning, can't put this book down, what will happen next plot. Just an idea--take this one on long trip where you'll need something to entertain you for a long time. (Hope this helps)"
4,Now I have to go read Jude's Law,I recently started the SBC Fighters series and wondered where Tim came from. That lead me to Murphy's Law.Really nice Lori Foster book. I can't say that it made me laugh as much as some of her other titles but the story line was more complete. Good dialogue.
5,Another Winner by Ms Foster,Ms. Foster has written another winner. This time the story is about to very different people. Quinton was born with every advance when Ashley was born with less than nothing. Ashley is determine to make it on her own without help from anyone. But when Ashley's life to in danger Quinton is determine to protect her. Wither or not Ashley wants it. This story has a good balance of romance (the steamy kind) and suspense. This book is visited by characters from Jude's Law but is a stand alone read. But Jude' Law is another must read. I have never been disappointed in a book with Lori Foster's name on it.
3,Awesome 2nd album!,"Hey Zombie,The version your looking for was actually a combination of the first two Triumph albums. It was the American version of ""Rock & Roll machine"". On CD (and import albums from the late 70's) it was ""Triumph"" (retitled ""In The Beginning"") and ""Rock & Roll Machine"". Your song (Blinding Light Show/Moonchild) can be found on the CD ""In The Beginning"""
3,Slightly absurd book,"This is a strange book, it tells the story about a British-American conspiracy to take over control of the UK. In it Daphne du Maurier seems to mix up a couple of different genres. There are the beginnings of some love stories, then there is also an action packed adventure thriller story trail, about an older sturdy woman and her strange adoptive children. Finally it's perhaps also a political book. The book was published in 1972. I don't know if the book's anti-American attitude was perhaps some last desperate attempt of an aging author to be trendy? But nevertheless, behind it all, and imbued into the story, is Daphne du Maurier! She has quite a lot of stamina, and she is, at the end of the day, a not too bad company to keep. I am looking forward to read some of her more renowned books, I am quite sure they are good!"
2,Not Her Best!,"I have been an avid Daphne du Maurier fan for 30 years. I had never read this book until a couple of weeks ago. I found it very disappointing and boring. Her books usually have that ""du Maurier"" feel to them, but not so in this case. She was a brilliant writer but this did not grab me at all. Her last novel."
2,Stimulating anti-colonial meander,Very different to Dauphne du Mauriers other books. I think it has value as a reflection on the experience of being colonised. Having forced ourselves on so many other countries and now living having no colonies it helped me see something of how it must feel to loose identity and freedom to another power. It needs rereading today.
2,Out of Date,"We found several problems with the information in this book. Places that were recommended were no longer in business or not as described. Some of the information about reservations, lines, etc. were written for peak season travel so we did a lot of things to avoid lines that were not there. Interesting background and some good tips, but if you have time to prepare, I would recommend something more in-depth and written more recently."
4,"Far Far away (star wars: along time ago, book 7)","Very informative a wonderful colloection by dark horse containing stories out of print of nearly 20 years. Along with A long time ago, volume 5 contains the stories of Fenn Shysa menchioned under Boba Fett in the Essential Guide to Characters, also refered to in the dark horse graphic novel: Boba Fett Twin Engines of Destruction."
5,"Bully for You, Teddy Roosevelt",My fourth grade daughter read the book for a project on a president. Very factual information given in book. Order of organization in book is good for her age. The book has been fun for her to read and myself as well as I followed along with her.
1,A Load of Crap,"This is a load of crap, don't even bother reading this one. Obviously he was one of the intelligence community that was listened to and relied upon heavily by this Administration. And I'm assuming Hussein is connected to all of his B.S. too! I bet the war hawks and war mongers loved this one!At least the intelligence community let him print this one. I'll give him that much..."
5,Required Reading,A phenomenal perspective and one every citizen of the US should read (especially the idiots in the Bush Administration).
1,convoluted writing,"Having read this, not sure what to call it, in 2008 in retrospect this writing has not proved valid. To charecterize bin Laden as ""distinguished"" one wonders how the author would define Joe Stalin, Adolph Hitler, Idi Amin etc. Bin Laden has a ""passion for martydom"" seems easy enough to accomplish yet he has avoided ""martydom"" for more than 10 years. ""Bin Laden has survived by the grace of God ... just as Iraq's Saddem Hussein has kept his regime intact"". AHH on second thought...To compare this terrorist with the heros of the American Revolution is pure drivil. Who were the suicide bombers in 1776? Bin Laden started the jihad because american military were stationed in Saudi Arabia. Why where they there? Because bin Laden was trying to overthrow the Saudi government. This book is not worth 5 minutes of your time."
4,Very good with excellent layout,"Well presented and clearly laid out in ""almost A4"" format with a healthy measure of exercises. Does a good job of smoothing the rough beginners and intermediate students path to German grammar and its usage. Can be heartily recommended."
3,Brief overview of grammar,"I had hoped this would be as great as the Spanish Grammar book in this series.It was not as easy to use, I really love the Spanish one and review it all the time.This one was not as easy to use. Or could it be, I know Spanish better and German barely at all? So it might be me, it might be the relative hardness of the languages for the background in languages of each student."
5,Our Blessed Mother,"So very great to go into without traveling, the home where our Blessed Mother had once lived,i am so pleased with this choice,,Blessed Mother inter cede for us with your Son Jesus,,may God Bless us all this new year,,"
4,Nice Album!!!,"This group has only two guys and they do all the work, is a nice album, easy to listen and a very nice design artwork. The cd sound could be better. Attention with this group in the near future."
5,5 starts!,What an incredible value for the quality of the recording. Highly recommend that you one for yourself and two or three to give away as presents (for those lovers of good music).
2,OK...,"It appears to me that one person wrote at least 3 out of 5 of those 5-star reviews (maybe all five of them). So here's a second opinion. This album is OK, however, I'd first recommend ""Up & Down Club Sessions Vol. 1"" - a compilation featuring 2 Alphabet Soup songs which are both better than any of the songs here. (You'll also get a great sampling of other artists whom you might like better.) If you like those 2 A.S. songs, then go ahead and buy this also."
5,Comme on a dit,"If you liked ""Louise Attaque,"" You'll love ""Comme on a dit"" even more! These guys are amazing. In a way, they remind me of a French Dave Matthews band, only a zillion times better. Their songs have a wayt of always improving my mood and if you speak French (or try to, anyway) their lyrics are always fun to figure out and even more fun once you understand them. This is the group's second album release and I hope that they keep them coming!"
4,Better than the music itself?,"This book was a lot of fun. I didn't know too much about ""country rock"" so I'm not an expert but I can tell ya one thing.Don't go out and buy every Poco record just cuz they ""invented"" country rock cuz they ain't that good. I do like the Dillards though."
3,OK for Californians,"Written in a rather amateur manner, but with loads of pictures and drawings, this book would appeal to people who are familiar with the area that these bandits roamed. One thing that really bothered me: Mr. Secrest references ""Black Bart"" nine times, in sentences such as ""but he was no... Black Bart"", or someone was rumored to have hung out with Black Bart, but never does he give you the actual story of Black Bart! When many characters are mentioned, its as if you were supposed to already know who they are. For instance: ""Badly wounded in the aborted raid, Emmett admitted that his brothers had done the Alila job."" Who is Emmett?? This is the first time he is mentioned, and it took me a minute to figure out that he must be one of the Dalton gang. That aside, this WAS an enjoyable book to read, and I will keep it in my library for future reference."
5,Nice Timepiece!!,"Good looking watch but the case can easily be scratch. For the price, it's a great buy overall. Casual or formal this one will work. I highly recommend this watch."
4,Seiko Coutura Watch,"I like the stop watch functions that this watch has. I also like the seperate dials for the different timekeeping functions. Unfortunately, this watch is hard to read in bright light. Such as sunlight and well lit spaces. Overall though, I like this watch because it looks good. Well, it looks good on me anyway."
5,One of the best... period.,"When I started listening to the Zippers (many a year ago) I fell in love with their style and grace -- and was even more impressed by their reimagining of a great old sound. ""The Inevitable"" is their first wide release, and it still stands as a their best recording to date. This was the wonder-years of the Zippers, before they caught fire with ""Hot"" and well before the exit of Tom Maxwell. This is their rawest, most un-produced best (and if you think that over-production makes music better... it never does for jazz acts).This album goes from the ecstatic (Good Enough for Grandad) to the sultry (Danny Diamond) to the just plain amazing (Wash Jones - one of the best recent songs in the ""le jazz hot"" tradition). If you like what you hear on ""Hot"" or ""Perennial Favorites,"" then ""The Inevitable"" will not let you down. Just sit down with a mint julep and prepare for a great album."
4,"Geez, I just like it very much, I appreciate musical talent",I am 75 years old and love all kinds of music and musical talent. I especially like new styles of old music. My son gave me the CD and I disscovered something new to me and a unique sound
4,Yet another great release from one of my favorite bands,"This Cd doesnt quite match up to its older brother, Hot, but does make me want to tap my feet and i like that."
2,Dissappointing,"I was a huge fan of ""Hot"", but this is not up to par with that one. It sounds as though some record exec. decided to ""modernize"" their sound to make them more like an ""alternative"" band. They should've stuck with the original premise. Still it has it's good moments."
2,"Used to like it, 'til I heard it done better","I used to really like this recording, until I heard this style of music played by musicians of a higher calibre. There are plenty of modern masters who leave the SNZ's in their dust. Consider Bob Brozman. He deserves the recognition that the SNZ's have garnered, but his vastly superior recordings are mostly unknown. He did better version of You're Driving Me Crazy in 1988 on ""The Devil's Slide, a record that the SNZ's have borrowed from (shamelessly, I think...their song ""Hell"" on the next record is a blatant ripoff of ""Death"" as performed by Brozman on ""The Devil's Slide"", right down to the faux spooky vocal). SNZ's are spirited, to be sure (if you ignore the fact that their lead singer has the charisma of a wet sock on stage) but they are so frankly derivative that it is hard to keep liking this recording after hearing more accomplished musicians tackle the same stuff with greater technique and fidelity to the period."
2,Diamond Stud Earrings - 3/4 Carat,"This product was delivered with a ""broken"" fastener for one of the earrings. It was so loose it was not on the earring and was in the box separately.As soon as we found that this was not acceptable, we returned to the vendor for a refund. The refund was credited to our credit card quite promptly so this part of the transaction was handled well!The product was shipped and received promptly also.V. W. WitwerSan Antonio, TX"
3,"It works well, but it doesn't last","My wife and I bought a unit of this model almost a year ago. We were very happy with it, it did its job just fine, but after the double-whammy snow storms of February 2010, it just stopped working. Whenever we started the microwave, it would begin ""heating"" the food, but it would stop on his own, after only a few seconds (no matter the length of time entered), and it would not heat at all. We thought it had been damaged due to power surges during the storms, but the fact that it was the only appliance in the entire house that suffered any kind of damage, made us little suspicious of the product's quality. Perhaps is not the model in its entirety, perhaps we just got hold of a unit from a ""bad batch,"" but, just to be on the safe side, I would advise other consumers to steer away from the Panasonic (at least for this particular model), and look for a similar model from another brand."
5,The Best For Beginners!,"Wow -- is this video great! I've been using it for almost a month, and I love it! I haven't been exercising for about a year, and this is the perfect program for me now. I've never done step aerobics before, and this is the best introduction I could have hoped for, even though it is dated. It's also super for those who, like me, need specific instructions as to the steps (even simple ones!) and who are uncoordinated. I couldn't have ordered up anything more perfect! This video is fun, and Leslie Sansone is pleasant and seems like a real person, not an overly-made up exercise goddess. I would highly recommend this for those just beginning to exercise or those who are re-introducing exercise into their lives. The steps are very basic, and walk aerobics (walking in place) are included. Everyone can do it! God bless you, Leslie Sansone!"
5,excellent beginner tape.,I thought this was so helpful for me. This is the first tape I started my exercise plan with. It is not to hard. The moves are basic and anyone can do it. I have all of leslies tapes and i think she is a hoot. She is sometimes a little off but her personality is what kept me coming back.I have lost a total of 40 pounds and Iam still going!
1,Famous Singers of Today and Yesterday,"I realized when reading the book, that it was about classical singers rather than pop singers. Although I do like some opera, I have never heard of any of these singers and removed the book from my device."
2,"Good demonstrations, few instructions","I was looking for a video to show elementary school girls the basics of beginning cheerleading. Instead, this is more of a demonstration of skills with a few instructional pointers."
4,Good one to have,"I own this system for over 2 months and I like this system, though it is bulky and little bigger for a small room.Appearance: The appearance is sober, elegant and classic, not the funky type.Speakers: It does not produce enough sound even in high volume level. But sound quality is very good. It suppresses high frequency notes a bit.CD changers: It has 3 CD changers. The buttons for Cd changers are in the top. If you keep it in the shelf high enough, you may not be able to see the buttons to change songs/CDs, etc. You can use remote controller alternatively. I would prefer the buttons in the front panelCassette: Dual cassette deck with Auto reverse in one. This was very important for me, as I have few cassettes I regularly listen to, and I hate to change cassette sides in every 20 minutesOverall, this is a good system to own and have"
1,Worthless product,I can't review a product that didn't work. It has been returned to Amazon for a refund. This was the second product sent to my house and I got no satisfaction from either. The second one obviously has a defective power supply.
3,Average,Works well once. After that it is a challenge. Customer service is well intentioned but ineffective.
1,Waste of time and money,"This product may work if there were detailed instructions and if there was any technical support. The technical support hours are M-F 9am to 5pm. When you call they ask you to leave a message. When you go to online support, after waiting for the online chat for 5 minutes, you receive a message stating it is unavailable at this time. Still waiting for the call back from my message."
1,not current version,This is not the latest version of the software and was not revealed in the description.
2,Works well the first time; one-use software,"I used Move2Mac to migrate my Windows sytem to my new iMac. Everything worked as it should. However, this software is licensed for one-use only. Detto does not disclose this anywhere on the box (surprise). It will not allow you to install it twice. So, consider connecting Ethernet to Ethernet before buying this product. It is rather expensive considering you will only use it once."
1,This was a waste of money,I should have read the others reviews. This software does not handle multiple identities and multiple users for the same computer. My computer was a mess after using this software. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!
1,Worst customer support on the planet!,This software does not do everything it claims on the front of the box.Read the small print (Inside the box) and cross your fingers. Forget callingcustomer support. Even the supervisor will not return calls when promised.They really don't care about you at all! This is a very dodgy outfit. I wish orrather hope the people who run or own the company would find out whatis happening in customer services and support. This really is the worst productand support level I have ever experienced in my life by such a long way.
2,Disappointing,"The product advertises that it transfers the average person's files from their PC to the Mac in 15 minutes. That is a joke. I had about 100 photos and 1000 MP3's (which I do not think is that far above average) and my estimated transfer time was 550 minutes. For the price it almost would have been worth it just to spend the time burning everything to CDs.Note that this product does not transfer programs, only your files. So you must install each program that you wish to transfer files of onto your Mac as well.I also had some issues of connecting both laptops to the internet and tried to opt to do the telephone option for verifying the license code. I waited on the phone for over half an hour to talk with a representative before I finally gave up.Before starting the project, make sure you have a lot of time to allow the files to transfer as you cannot shut down either computer during the transfer time."
1,Poor,Very disappointed in this product. I noticed no difference in the floor tile after applying this product.
3,"Not Great TV, but . . .",". . .it does feature William H. Macy and Joan Cusack, who are compulsively watchable when they are on screen separately or together."
5,Awesome!!,Just watch one episode and your hooked! All characters play an excellent role. The fact that its also filmed in Chicago is a plus.
1,Not the american one??,This is not the one i thought I was getting What can i do? Have not opened it yet~~I want the American Actors~
3,Mediocre at best,"Pretty depraved and immoral show... but that's not why I didn't really like it. I just thought it was sort of slow. I almost didn't even watch through to the end, and I definitely won't buy the next season. It had it's moments (and a couple pretty good characters), but I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Sucked!,"The timing was bad from the 1st word spoken. It was all about how poor they are, but they're eating cereal in a giant box from Sam's Club. It wasn't funny. The dialogue is absolutely not memorable. The teenage daughter seems to be showing a lot of nipple. It just had bad deliverance of the lines, hard to follow, and I just could not get into it, at all. Did not continue watching it."
3,Shameless USA ..LIP= Phineas and Ferb?,"Is it me or does the actor who plays LIP from the show SHAMELESS looks like that little cartoon character PHINEAS. isnt he suppose to be the ladies man of the show and the tough guy? hard to believe everytime i see him.. lol. Also whats with his pants that he is wearing this season ..looks like something out of westside story.As for fionna,, they made her slutty in this US version, Dont get me wrong... any time to see emmy rossum getting down and dirty is ok in my book. 3 stars for emmy nude!"
5,Great Show,"Well, it has not been released yet and I can not say anything about the quality of blu-ray yet, but the show itself is 5 stars. It is well worth watching."
5,Funny,"Best show on television. With the rest of the television becoming reality tv, it is good to see something well writtten, funny and no canned laughter."
5,Great show!,"I didn't see all of Series 1 and I don't know when they're going to air Series 2 (and apparently there's a Christmas special too) on BBC America, but from what I saw, this show is awesome! I hope they'll release it on DVD in the States soon."
3,Good series; Poor streaming,"I like this series very much. It is entertaining, but when we watch it while streaming, it is stopping and pausing a lot. When I looked into it, it was suggested the wifi connection was not strong, however we have Netflix and use the same wifi connection and never have a problem with it stopping and having to be resumed. I'm not sure what the problem might be.I really do like the series though and it has made us laugh a lot. It's very quirky and the characters are very strong characters. I would love to watch an episode where it isn't stopping in the middle of a scene."
1,Horrible,"Couldn't get past the first 10 minutes. Total waste of money. If you like Downton Abbey, don't try this one."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This turkey glorifies alcoholism. The father abandons his children to slobber booze, fight and pass out wherever he ends up. The daughter mothers the other children, gets drunk and screws whatever strikes her. The rest of the children are liars and thieves. The only thing missing is the abuse that the alcoholic father should be perpetrating. They have reduced sex to the rutting of pigs."
4,Truly Shameless,After spending one episode with this family I had to get season 1 on DVD. The characters are shameless but always lovable and William Macy has my respect as I have never seen him carry a role so well.I highly recommend but warn you it's very addictive.
5,The Whole Package,"This show is the whole package: uneasy, sad, uplifting, hilarious, exciting, and most importantly of all addicting! I could watch this show over and over again, in a few words, I am simply obsessed. The actors are great and the characters are those rare breed that you can easily identify with every single one. I could go on for hours about Shameless, but I think I will just let you find out for yourselves how awesome it is. Go watch asap!"
5,Laughing too hard to stay on the treadmill,"I love this show. It's not for everyone, but it hits my funnybone. Somehow everything turns out OK at the end of each episode."
2,Church's teaching,"This version of the Sacred Scriptures is not approved by the Church because of it's use of ""inclusive"" language. You would be better off if you ordered a Revised Standard Edition or New American Bible (Catholic Ed) for personal study."
4,Cleaned my tile and grout better than my expectations,My tile is similar to stone and difficult to clean. The DuPont spray worked great. and I highly recommend it
4,I guess,"I think is ok but didn't really see much of a difference unfortunately, but used it once only! will give it a few more tries"
2,Disappointed,This product is okay but not worth the price I paid for it. There are other brands on the market that are superior to this product and much cheaper.
5,Love it,Love Skip Hop bags & this one is great because the laminated fabric wipes clean very nicely!
5,economics explained,"I ordered the wrong book so I never used this book. However, the supplier was very easy to work with."
2,Interesting book for the current socialist view,"While this book is easy to read and provides some information on economics, it was primarily interesting to me because it gives information as to how current socialists view the economy.The actual economics in the book are weak. The authors don't even pretend to understand 'money'. I assume that is because the authors would like to do away with money. But you can't hope to really understand the US economy if you don't understand money.If you'd like a better understanding of the economy check out Thomas Sowell's ""Basic Economics: A Citizen's Guide to the Economy""P.S. If you don't believe me that Heilbroner is a socialist, see his book ""Marxism: For and Against""."
1,Interesting book for Socialists or studying Socialism,"While providing some information on economics, this book was primarily interesting to me because it gives information as to how current socialists view the economy.The actual economics in the book are weak. The authors don't even pretend to understand 'money'. I assume that is because the authors would like to do away with money. But you can't hope to really understand the US economy if you don't understand money.If you'd like a better understanding of the economy check out Thomas Sowell's ""Basic Economics: A Citizen's Guide to the Economy"""
5,superb overview,"This is a terrific resource for basic literacy in economics. It targets a reader who keeps abreast of current affairs and who wants a fuller understanding of the economics terms, mechanisms, theories, and controversies underlying them. The book delivers on its promise to explain economics to such a reader, and does so succinctly and engagingly.Much has been said of the book's biases. The book does not offer pollyannish praise of markets, nor does it demonize government. The reverse is also true. The authors identify controversies in economics, lay out both sides as fairly and clearly as possible, and expose their own biases. This is as balanced a book on economics as one is likely to find."
4,Good intro for novices,"This is a readable, non-technical and socially-aware introduction to basic economics. It is as good a mainstream introduction to basic economics and serves as an excellent companion to other prescribed introductory textbooks."
5,My handy reference to Economic Theory,"At times, I find myself reading other books that refer to various economic theories that I am either unaware of or do not fully understand. I have found that Heilbroner and Thurow have done a very thorough job in this work to create a laymens book on economics that is easy to read and understand. I have found that this book in particular, serves my needs very well, as a primer on basic economic theory.Robert Heilbroner is an excellent writer, notwithstanding his liberal slant. Lester Thurow, was the author of my college econimics text. The combination of the two, creates a powerful synergy and delivers a superb product.I believe you will find the book reader-friendly: Easy to read, full of answers to of the laymens questions, and even somewhat enjoyable to read."
4,the hobo philosopher,"This is an excellent introduction to today's economics. It covers the basics like supply and demand, inflation, savings and investment, but also covers more modern concepts like privatization and the public sector, globalization and money and banking. It touches on a few traditional economic personalities - Smith, Marx and Keynes. It discusses the national debt and deficit spending and all the major things most people are talking about in today's average world. If you know nothing about economics but want to learn, this is the book for you. If you know all about economics but want to review the basics this book is for you. This book even discusses the ethics and morality of our modern day capitalism which I thought was rather refreshing.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:America On Strike - A survey of Labor strikes in America."
5,Great coat,I have been using this jacket for about a year. It's durable and warm yet can be worn when it not that cold as well.
1,Nothing Great Here,"This is a rip-off. Only ""Mr. Bojangles"" is the closest song to anything resembling a ""greatest hit"" on this DVD. There are barely eight NGDB (mediocre) performances here, with songs like ""Dance Little Jean"" and ""Randy Lynn Scruggs Rag"" being absolute throwaways. ""Partners Brothers Friends"" is a song to mark, they say, twenty years of the group's staying together. There are other artist fillers included -- two forgettable songs by Stella Parton and two by Gus Harding == that simply add a few minutes to the brief collection.The editing is lousy, the ""bonuses"" are fuzzy ads for what appear to be other DVDS by second or third tier rock performers. Packaging this as ""Greatest Hits Live"" is unfair to this great group. Think carefully about purchasing this disappointment."
2,Nitty Gritty Dirt Band: Greatest Hits Live,I wouldn't waste money on this one - it contains other artists (not with NGDB) and is not very good quality.
3,Too much poetry,"I did find this book helpful to some degree, but a good portion of the book is made up of poems to use. Poetry is OK sometimes, but many of the ones in the book were rather corny. I can't see myself using poems every time I want to convey my feelings. It would have been more helpful if there were more sample letters in the book."
2,Not what I expected,I bought this book thinking it would help with my holiday letter writing and a letter I wished to write for a friend who recently married. I was very disappointed in the sparse selection of sample letters and the overabundance of poems and gift ideas. It's not something I'll reach for often.
2,Not as great as I thought,"From the review I thought this would be a great book to have, but I find it lacking and thin. Many of the suggestion were repeated [...]. I thought this book is more about ideas of words to write, and indeed it has some, but not a lot to choose from."
4,This book reads like my mother talks,I thought Updike really captured the stream-of-consciousness way of speaking of a lot of women (my mom has this tendency). It was hilarious to read about this woman leaving behind all the trivia of everyday life in favor of spiritual enlightenment but still clinging tight to her old world. This was a really good book. Great plot twist at the end.
4,"Nutty, intelligent, impressionable woman kept me entertained","If I'd read a review that said ""flaky society woman juggles marriage, divorce, life on a commune, Eastern religion, isolation, sexual experiences, driving others crazy..."" I'd have not bothered reading ""S"" as I'd figure that this kind of story could only be hatched in some flaky grocery checkout counter tabloid. Problem: I've gotta tell you that this book was one of my most enjoyable reads. In ""S"" John Updike crams so much humor, wit, knowledge, speculation, wisdom and surprise into every paragraph that I couldn't put the book down. The wacky S -- Sarah -- hurls herself into situations that normal people wouldn't even think of doing. Book is also a depiction of Indian ""religion"" at its worst."
5,I thought I might die laughing,"or have my dear wife find me crumpled in front of the fireplace, a mere cinder, all that was left of my hilarity. This book is very, very funny. Although it is clear that Updike never had the chance to give it one more rewriting (there's stuff left that's like scaffolding), he creates one of the most amusing narrator-protagonists in modern literature. She is funny when she wants to be and funny, too, when she doesn't realize that she is.Updike wrote a lot of novels, but I have my favorites:Rabbit at Rest and Villages. He was a master, under-appreciated, I think, because he didn't choose to take popular political stands. This late novel is one more proof of his unrivaled versatility. Get past the rough going at the beginning, and this book will make you glad."
2,Not So Good,"""S."" is a story told through letters about a woman who leaves her husband and runs off to follow an Indian guru. I thought this would be a great book since I love Updike and thought the premise for the book was hysterical. However, it was like reading the journal of a boring, neglected middle aged woman who loves to ramble about nothing at all. Try ""Couples"" or ""Witches of Eastwick"" instead to see what greatness Updike is really capable of."
4,Pretty Good.,It works great. You just have to apply liberally and rub carefully. Note that it cannot clean up denim stains on leather bag though.
3,I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE THIS PRODUCT? COULD U PLEASE SEND ME AN E-MAIL SHOWING HOW TO USE BECAUSE I ? THANKS.,"DEAR SIRS, I HAVE TRIED TO USE THIS PRODUCTE BUT NO USE THE STAIN IS NOT GOING OUT, IT STAYS THE SAME. PLEASE SHOW ME HOW TO USE THIS PRODUCE. THANKS."
1,I wish I could give this a 0!,"This was easily the most insulting piece of garbage I have ever seen in my life. I am a special education teacher and a Dyslexia specialist. I cannot believe that special education was called the ""retard class"" by teachers in the film! I also am SHOCKED about the way special education teachers were portrayed in this movie! What only former drill sargeants and ESL speakers want to teach special education classes?? PLUS.... the word should is a red word!! You wouldn't draw a long sound symbol over it! I know for a fact that there are plenty of qualified people who WANT to help ALL children. I could tell that this producer/director has some deep seeded animosity towards the school system he went through, I am certain that his Mother helped him a lot, which is nice. I just do not think this movie is fair to educators in general."
2,Acting okay but overall the movie is pretty BAD,"Sorry to use the title as a play on words, but more could have been done with this film topic I think. It plays out like an afterschool special and not a particularly compelling one at that."
2,OK,"Why is Amazon presenting this as a gay film? It's a short film about ADS, it has nothing to do with anything gay. It's an interesting short, but why Amazon thinks it's gay, I have no idea."
3,a handy map,"If you are drving the main roads of Italy, this handy map folds up and opens up and keeps its handy laminated shape. If you are looking for small villages, this will not work."
2,Map of Italy,This is just a fold out map of Italy. It only displays the major highways of the entire country.
1,Waste of Money,This tiny map has only major road and cities. Very little detail. Not worth ordering.
3,Kick...,"*** La Femme Nikita fans will love Maggie Shayne's entry into this anthology, The Bride Wore a .44. A woman who can remember nothing finds her memory returning as her wedding to a man she does not love approaches, and she finds her hope chest is full of guns. Jacey Ford's Painkillers finds a model working undercover to bring down drug lords. Warfem by Angela Knight is basically PWP, best skipped, frankly. However, Mary Janice Davidson's The Misadventures of Boo and Boy Blunder is worth the price of the anthology all on its own. An albino vampire slayer finds herself with an unwanted sidekick when she is hired by an all too attractive, charming vampire stand-up comedian to kill scumbag vampires. Those who have followed the adventures of Betsy the Vampire Queen will enjoy the foreshadowing of a possible meeting between Betsy and Boo. All in all- this is a half wonderful half so so anthology, but the wonderful half makes up for the not so wonderful half. ***Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
2,Paired together,"with another book i found to be kick ass, yet this book was lacking the umpfff I normally enjoy while reading Maggie's books."
2,Kick A$$,"I'm a big MJD fan. However, beware. All three writers are off in this one. Still a must read for hard core fans, but don't get your hopes up that it will be very good."
4,Awesome stories,"I really enjoyed the first story!. It was amazing. A combination of sassy with romance. Maggie S. really knows how to write a story, she made me wish it was a novel. However the rest of the stories weren't as great as the first one."
2,backordered,"Found out item was backordered after ordering. After approx 2 weeks with no change in shipping status, canx order."
2,Overall: Disappointing,"I expected better quality for the price. Knives handles are OK, but seem a little on the cheap side as far as weight and finish. The top side of the knives blades should have been rounded to ease the rather sharp edges. Big disappointment on the knife block; it isn't designed to accommodate specific knives in specific places. Knife handles don't line up properly in the block and so look sloppy on the counter. Overall: Disappointing!"
5,Love the Twins!,"Let me just start by saying I LOVE learning how to cook new and different things. I'm not an expert chef, but many friends consider me to be their source for cooking advice. That being said, having recently gotten married, I was scouring the internet for reviews on great knife sets that wouldn't break the bank... Then I realized I should just ask my expert cook mom! Without hesitation or even batting an eye, she recommended I look for Zwilling JA Henckels TWIN knives to be the set that starts our newly married life. AND if possible, search for ones NOT made in China...We then bought the 11-piece set and it has proven to be the best culinary addition to our new family's kitchen! Since I received these beautiful knives with Amazon's wonderful & prompt delivery (July 2012), I've used these knives with anticipation for what I will cook, every single day! Even after daily use (after 4-5 months) the edges are as sharp as ever, with no sign of dulling yet!"
4,Knife and block review,"We bought this set as a Christmas gift to ourselves, because the $10 knife set I bought from Wal-Mart years ago was never very good in the first place and we wanted to stop fighting to cut through food.These knives are fabulous. There is a large variety to choose from, and they all cut through vegetables and meat like butter. I am in love with the knives.I would have given 5 stars, but the one thing I hate about the set is the pre-fab ""one size fits all"" knife block. I can't stand it. I would much prefer a block where the slots are cut to the size of the blades. I would suggest if that is a pet peeve of yours as well, to go out and find a new block that you like. We are in the process of doing so ourselves.Otherwise the set is great. I have always heard great things about Henckels, and knew that they were the knife set I wanted. Upon use, I am glad to find out that they are just as great as I had heard."
3,"Good, but not great","I was always awed by the quality of the Henckels's brand knife and decided to finally take the plunge and shell out the $300 for the block and steak knives. While there is absolutely no comparison to the crappy knives I got at Target 2 years ago, I was a little dissapointed overall. The knives, while extremely sharp, actually feel a bit flimsy in the hand. I'm not suggesting one try to cut a can of beans in half with one of these, but the feel of the knives, especially the smaller, ones was a bit underwhelming. I did research after this purchase and discovered that this particular set is essentially a starter set and that there are several higher quality Henckel models whose cost is into the thousands.So I suppose for the money the knives were a decent deal but don't expect top-of-the line performance."
4,Wood Block does not fit the knifes set,"Knifes are excellent good quality and Germans but wood block really does not fit the knifes set, and is low finishing (made in China)"
5,Sharp,J.A. Henckels Twin Signature Stainless-Steel 11-Piece Knife Set with Block. Super sharp and well balanced knives. I gave these as a gift but did try them out. They were great to use. The best price I found was on Amazon.com!
5,"Perfect knives, awesome set!",These knives are amazing and super sharp. They cut extremely well! The only down side at all to this set is there are no steak knives but that is a matter of just buying them! Totally would recommend to any and everyone!
2,"Twin Signature: very light, cheapest model","I was looking for a nice set of knives to give as a gift; saw these and thought what a great deal. When they arrived I opened the box and was immediately turned off by how light the knives were. They were so light it made me think that they were low quality. I looked on J.A.Henkel's website and indeed the ""Zwilling: Twin Signature"" is their lowest quality/most affordable model.I did not actually try using the knives. They may have been great in the end, but the weight made me nervous enough to return them and try one of the mid-range models instead."
5,Better than Dr. Seuss and really silly.,"I'm four and my Daddy bought two children's books for me on my birthday. They're okay, but he got this 'Wumpy Gwavy' book for himself, and I really love it. I grabbed it as soon as it was out of the box and sat reading it for an hour, constantly asking my Daddy questions. ""Daddy? Why is the doggie drawing on the other doggie? He's silly."" ""Ha, ha, that man looks like an ice-cream cone Daddy."" ""Look at all the butt-moons in the bus, what are all the butt-moons doing on the bus Daddy?"" After dinner we all read it together even though Daddy wanted to read me the books he got me. This was a few weeks ago and now everyone has read it, its really funny. Grandma came over and woke us up in the morning because she was laughing too much and Mommy wants to use some of the pictures for work to make people laugh while she's teaching them"
1,Worst Cartoons Ever,"Sorry to disagree with everyone else, but this is the WORST collection of un-funny cartoons ever. Trying so hard to be ""The Far Side"", and failing mainly due to... no cleverness, no complexity, no funniness. I'm not trying to be mean; John Long has his heart in the right place. But if you're a clever person at all, you probably won't find more than a handfull of these cartoons remotely funny."
2,Good Gravy?,"I bought this for my grandmother a few weeks before Christmas 2001 in anticipation of a lovely slap-up turkey dinner with lump-free gravy. I'd read a previous customers review claiming they'd bought it and it had revolutionised their Sunday lunches, but I have to say I was very disappointed. Not only was the gravy still lumpy, but it was cold, and hairy. I wouldn't buy this book again."
4,"Holds a lot, cannot be opened except by pull string","My experience with pinatas is to hit them with a stick to break them open, but no amount of beating on this, even by an adult, is going to break this pinata. You must use the pull strings, and only one of them will open it. The kids pulled off all the ribbons, and we had to just open the pinata and shake it."
4,"Worried that it would open too easily, but it didn't","We got this for my son's 4th birthday party. We had about 20 kids and I was worried that this would open after the 4th or 5th kid and none of the others would get a chance at the pinata. Well, I didn't have to worry about that. All the kids took a turn and it still didn't open. The adults had to step in and give it a few really good whacks.So the product worked well for our purposes. It looks just as it is pictured and it kept a bunch of 4 year old engaged for a while."
4,A good resource but not the best for DC,"I like these Inside Out pop-up style maps and have used them in Paris, London, San Francisco, etc.I wanted to get one for Washington DC and it was hard to find one. I think I ended up getting one shipped from the UK.Anyway, although I have relied on these maps before, for Washington DC I found that I liked the Streetwise map better, perhaps because it was just a flat, laminated map versus a mini-book.Generally you will find the same map layout, very handy and easy to read."
1,screwed,I'm not sure how I would have liked them since they sent me a round cut instead of the Princess cut I ordered. These are dishonest people. Buyer beware! They never responded to email..
1,I don't recommend the book.,"Draper was a past liberal RLDS apostle that was involved in the 1967-68 seminars with two United Methodist professors from St. Paul's School of Theology. These seminars were a major point where the RLDS leadership planned and began to bring departures into the church away from the original doctrines and beliefs. They admitted that they set out to do these things in a book called, 'Let Contentions Cease' published by Graceland/Park Press."
4,Ken Ishii - Flatspin,"Pure, unadulterated techno from one of the Japanese masters. On _Flatspin_, Ken Ishii returns to the swirling, dense techno which made him famous in the mid-90s. ""Iceblink"" is immediately catchy, a shimmering piece of tech-house; when it reprises with vocals from Inner City, it takes a shiny house feel. Meanwhile, ""Grab It Attack It"" inches towards funk and ""Gap Accelerator"" moves into some thick breaks. ""Infrangible"" has an industrial edge to augment the hard-set snare drums. The pure rhythm of ""Drums in Friction"" establish an unconquerable groove, but the crystalline downtempo of ""Mirage"" and ""Frozen Reminiscence"" restore a sense of calm. ""Moonquake"" merges the beats and the atmosphere, while ""Sneaking Shadows"" slips into noir funk. Worth a spin, indeed."
5,love the color,"I had a pedicure at a local spa and absolutely loved the royal tease color. The spa didn't have any bottles to sell, so my search began. Wasn't able to find it at any of the retailers that sell China Glaze, so I turned to Amazon. What a deal I got!!! I get so many compliments on my nails...."
3,Haynes Repair Manual,"From the diagram I expected to receive two books, but I only received one which is not a problem since it contained most of what I wanted anyway. The descriptions are pretty clear although I find that there are not enough diagrammatically explained instructions. The wiring diagrams in the back don't cover all of the models, and the information I desperately needed (main reason that I bought this book) was not included. But it did come in handy for some other repairs and maintenance work which redeemed it considerably."
5,a very pursuasive and passionate window onto a dark world.,This book resonates. By painting intimate portraits of several insiders we are allowed an unprecedented proximity to this closed world. The author is careful never to judge his subjects thus confirming his own credibility. It is one of the most noteable books I have ever read and it has left it's indelible mark on me even 2 years after reading it. Bravo.
5,Die Schone Mullerin,"Outstanding performances, by both soloist and accompanist. The singing is nuanced without being over-emoted (there is no unnecessary bellowing or sliding around). I find Hagegard especially fine in soft passages."
5,"Beautiful,Soulful, Wonderful!","Absolutely loved this song! Would not even know it was Garth Brooks. The melody and words are so heartfelt one gets ""lost in the song"". Simply close your eyes and listen and you'll be transported to another time and place.The acoustic guitar playing blends perfectly! Way to go Garth! He could easily cross over to pop. In fact this c.d. is being played on a smooth jazz station in San Diego. 5 Stars! Great Xmas gift!"
3,HELP I AM SOOOOO CONFUSED,Ok..im sitting here watching VH1's story on Chris Gaines... then I read that its Garth Brooks... who the heck is this guy? I AM WAY CONFUSED ! Im seeing pics of a young kid with long hair that looks nothing like him now... Please email me at CherylH304@aol.com. Thanx....
4,Oh my goodness,"Ya'll want to know the truth, I didn't think this was really Garth Brooks when I first heard it. this is a pretty cute song I think Garth is changing a little bit."
2,Garth doesn't lead but copies other artists...,"Garth Brooks shows a good penchant for copying the styles of others with his new song. He lacks originality and credibility, however.Garth made his mark in Country by testing the limits and forcing people to listen to his newer style. With Chris Gaines he does little more than attempt to sound like Eric Clapton.Side B sounds more like Garth, but at the same time it makes side A sound all the more unspectacular. Not good listening..."
2,Lost in You,"I love the song ""Lost in You"" by Chris Gaines. I would love to hear more songs from him. He's a great singer. Real mellow."
5,Great Resource,"This book was required for one of my psychology courses. It is a great book for psychology in general. If you are going into psychology, this is a great book to have, whether you need it for a class or not."
3,Reviewed for home use only,"It has no answer key! It would be fine for a very fluent Greek speaker to use with a student, but not for a student alone, or in our case a non-Greek homeschool mom trying to teach her highschooler. The workbook includes a journal entry which is ridiculous. Who journals in a language they are just beginning to learn!"
1,Same like previous recording,"I am a fan of modern flamenco music. I listen to the Gipsy Kings, NovaMenco, Paco De Lucia & Vicente Amigo. They are the best there is.And this guy armik keeps recording the same old Greek Style music and call it flamenco.He keeps repeating the same music but changes the front cover with pretty paintings.I don't recommend him.Check out the other names I mentioned above."
5,recommended,I am in John Berardi's Precision Nutrition Lean Eating program. These were the vitamins that were recommended for the program.
4,The Boys From Bath,"Tears For Fears--Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith--was one of the most underrated but highly imaginative and candid bands of the 80s. Their lyrics were honest and sometimes heartwrenching; their music was catchy; and their vocals were soulful.Due to artistic differences (really) the two men parted ways in the early 90s. Rumors have it that they may be recording again together soon. Only time will tell.IN MY MIND'S EYE is concert footage and video footage mostly taken from the band's first album, THE HURTING. 'Tis a good video if you are a fan and can find a copy."
4,poly zap glue 1/2 oz,I bought this glue as was lower in price than any other site I found it on. I bought it for some jewelry I am making and it works great.
2,Where's Ali?,"This book is a disappointment. It is more a discourse on the cultural attitudes of western European travellers (a topic already done to death by other academics over the past twenty years) than it is an original study of Ali Pasha. It merely reformulates in academic jargon the same information on Ali that has long been available in more readable form elsewhere. No doubt this reformulation will appeal to some readers, but for many this will be a book to slog through."
3,Ali Pasha,Fleming needs to go back in Epirus and rewrite the book. I thought Ali Pasha was Albanian.
3,A little too much hellenism,"The book is a good reading, however Fleming puts Ali Pasha much more in a Greek context rather than in an Albanian one. It seems that the Greek factor is overly emphasized as to attract more attention to the story of Ali Pasha. My trips in the area show that Ali Pasha is much more present among Albanians than Greeks. Yet my kudos go to the author for exploring such an intriguing figure as Ali Pasha."
4,It's OK,"I'm a little surprised at the reviews saying this amp is plenty loud. It doesn't seem very loud to me. For a practice amp, it's OK. The various amp models are handy, I suppose, but not as useful as say, a number of guitar amp models are on a guitar amp. One of them is a hidden model, rather than something on the knob; you have to know which buttons to push to replace one amp model with the hidden one. The manual explains that. The synth seemed more like a fun toy than something I could get consistently good effects out of. Volume varies a lot between the amp models on the 110. If Amazon's current price is good for this amp, it's a very compact but decent practice amp, or (as the name suggests) studio amp or performance amp as long as you're running it into a larger system."
4,Incisive Observations,"Although parts of this book are no longer topical (published 1989), there are some enduring truths here. Dr. Silber is a knowledgeable critic of America's educational structure, and advocates revision from age 3 (educational pre-school) through college (teach substantive subject material to Ed students, not touchy feely soft subjects).Silber cites more sources, with less pedantry, than any writer I can recall. Pithy, relevant, readable."
3,Like a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich,"This book sticks like peanut butter to the roof of your mouth. While peanut butter is good, it is high in bad cholesterol. This can mean only one thing, a little jelly with the peanut butter--thus peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Now sugar is bad for you and jelly has lots of sugar in it. Peanut butter and Jelly sandwiches taste good but are bad for you. Good/Bad. I guess the point I am making is some people like peanut butter, some jelly, some peanut butter and jelly. Just be sure to eat some vegetables, exercise and brush your teeth afterwards. So what does this have to do with this book. About as much as the vitriolic attacks on this page against the author by those who obviously have not read the book."
1,Materialism destroyed Silber,"Was there ever a greedier university president than John Silber? A man who larded his board of trustees with non-entities to whom he doles out over $30 million worth of business every year in exchange for the USA's highest university president salary? He whined his way into a no interest loan - later forgiven completely - because living in the president's house had excluded him from the housiing market?! He once proposed taking our insurance policies on BU students, quipping that, in some cases, their deaths would be the only contribution they'd ever make. And of course, the final indignity - a $2 million payout to his hand-chosen successor whom Silber had fired before he ever started the job. Other universities that started at the same point that BU in the 1970s have gone much further than BU. Silber has stunted the university for years."
2,Felt a little cheated. . .,"The shipping was more than the product---the seller was Canadian, and at the time the dollar was more favorable, but the seller did not convert the $.I spilled coffee on my mac and this little gadget saved me a whole lot of headache. . . durable, rinses well."
2,wrong type,"The item itself was great, but it was advertised to be for a 4th generation nano, but it was actually for a 3rd. But I just kept it, it was have cost almost as much as the item cost itself to send it back."
2,Fragile and bad sound,"I bought this player a week ago, when I opened the box I was suprised for all the stuffes that comes with it...software, belt, two colors battery bases, etc. I plugged it in my portable and copied some music. The sound was not good enough ( if you compare this with the RCA Lyra's one for instance ) , I tried by setting the equalizer but it did not make big difference. Some time later it started to sound worse, one channel was unavailabled because I could barely hear the singers in the song. I thought in replace it with a new one, but I asked for my money back instead. It's a really weak player, it seems more like a memory stick than a real MP3 player. I love music, and a like listen it very loud with my headphones or my car stereo, and this ""thumb-drive"" doesn't work for that."
5,Excellent MP3 Player,"I purchased a Creative MuVo 128 NX about six months ago. Since then it has seen moderate use (2-3 hours a week) and I have no complaints. You get just what it says: a truly tiny MP3 player that holds a couple hours worth of songs. Also, the player is so light that you won't notice it while running/walking.Pros:- tiny size and light weight- decent battery life (approx. 9 hours per AAA)- ease of use- several play modes (shuffle, repeat, etc)- voice recorder- plugs directly into USB port for file transferCons:- 128 MB only holds a couple hours of songs- no built-in FM tuner (available on other models)- horrible provided headphonesNotes:I have ""outgrown"" this player and upgraded to the MuVo 512 TX FM. You'll be suprised at how quickly 128 MB fills up."
2,Volume Problems,"This product worked great for the first 3 weeks. Now, the sound cuts off unless I lower the volume. I assumed that my MP3's were clipping or over modulating so I re-ripped them using the normalize feature. No change. I have to lower the volume to almost half in order for the music to NOT cut out mid song. With these dinky headphones, I can hardly hear anything.Also, it takes a single AAA battery which dies very quickly.The size is great. The data storage is great. The voice recorder is adequate. But I think I would rather have a hard drive based player. I got mine on sale but the retail price is WAY too much for this product to be worth the purchase."
1,Cash your paycheck and flush it,"Take your friend out for beers before you waste your money on this thing. If you don't use it, it could last a very long time."
2,POOR SOUND QUALITY,"this is my third mp3 player for the last 7 months. first of all, the earphones almost deafened me because of the quality, and also what kind of sound would u get with a little piece of plastic the size of ur thumb??? in my opinion, try getting something from digitalway or iaudio because the u can get the best sound from them."
2,"ok, but should be better","This product is great but, the fowlling are problems1.not a rechargable battery, if you like your music loud like me, then the battery inly lasts like 5 hours2. the mic can bearly pick up voice3. the memory is not expamdable.4. the included headphones suck. Also the usb flash isn't that good.The only good thing is no so software ans you can change the color.Crearve just needs to ad a rechagable batter anf fm radio!"
4,the greatest little book,Creative effort from a first time author. I enjoyed every piece of advice and the resources provided in the book are awesome. I recommend this book to anyone who is considering making a change in their career or who just wants to improve the one that they have.
2,This reads like an outline for a Tom Peters book,"If you buy this book, you will end up asking yourself why you spent so much for something that is merely pages and pages of glossy color graphics with very little substance. 50% of its readers could pull these pearls of wisdom from any of the dozens of other career books and, if they had access to a publisher, come out with the same generic summary. Most points are very obvious and come with no suggestions on how to move forward on each point."
1,Manage your expectations,"After losing my job, and almost every other job I've ever had, I thought this book would be my ticket out of loserville. I had high hopes and well, I was let down. I just couldn't figure out how this book applied to me or any of my friends. I read Dr. Phil's book and it was much more concise."
3,So so.,"Although I found some attention grabbing ""truths"" when I initially skimmed this book I had to put it down soon after I started reading it. The writing is glib and the humor smug and a little self-conscious. You can almost see the writer laughing at her own jokes. Some helpful advice if you can get past the writing."
1,I don't get it,"I thought this book was going to inspire me, but it only confused me. A lot of the information made sense on a hypothetical level, but I couldn't see how to apply it to my everyday job , career and life."
1,pitiful not pithy,"I know my title reads harsh, but I am very disappointed! After seeing it's flashy graphics and reviews on Amazon, I purchased this book with high hopes that it would jump start my stay-at-home-husband's (& daddy) re-entry into the job market. Unfortunately, many of the tips seemed VERY familiar [maybe it's just the career book genre?] while the rest were so unrealistic they're absurd.Definitely not the motivational boost I was hoping for. At least I got it on sale. It'll be even less at my neighbor's garage sale..."
1,fooled by the cover,"I find it hard to believe that the ""Truth"" about careering can be told by a young woman who has discovered that she is pregnant with the twins and has to stay in bed right after she went bankrupt with her business due to the Sept 11, when she was the only ""provider of bread"" for the family. It's just too much of a drama. How would she know at that moment anything about career? Just a bunch of lies. The book should be called ""how I survived my drama""The graphic design is excellent though (this maybe what the ""truth"" about success actually is - good design helps you sell anything)"
2,The design was cool,"I loved how cool this book looked. But it needed more than just to be pretty. It should also be useful and I didn't find it to apply to me. I really wanted to like it, but when push came to shove it was boring."
2,Radical Trut h#48. Can't get much more Radical.,"I found that I couldn't read this book straight through. It was better to just flip around and take in a few truths each day. While flipping today I stumbled upon truth #48. Talk about radical! Nothing like a big picture of a breast. My husband leaned over and said ""What job is that? Do they have any openings?"". I have to agree with some of the other reviews and say that this book can be very dull. On the other hand if a breast is what you want, buy this book."
5,UNBELIEVABLE,"I am an entrepenour and am always looking for a book or dvd that can help me motivate, focus, and ultimately push well past where I currently am.My life is not just my work. I have a wife of 10 years and a little girl. It is not always easy to balance the equations and give everybody and everything their deserving attention.Along came Radical careering. Amazon recommended it to me the same day that a good friend brought it up. So, what the hell one more book for the shelves.This is like no other book I have ever read. It is creative beyond anything I have encountered. I read 5 pages here and 5 pages there and feel like I always stumble upon some nugget that motivates me and pushes me right back on track.I have purchased 7 copies and given them to my employees. I can only hope for them the same experience I got from reading this amazing book."
3,One Step Forward,"The song writing is much stronger than their self-titled album, and the vocals even improve, but not often enough. I still get the feeling that this could really have been much more than a cult band if only somebody had firmly confronted Nikki Sudden about his sour voice. Sure, it can have its charming qualities in the roughness, but more often than not it's beyond rough - it's the cliched wail of an alley cat that gets the old shoe thrown at it."
5,Our family favorite,"My husband is a fireman, so my 5 year-old daughter has received many books about firefighters and fire trucks. This book has always been her favorite (so much so that we have had it memorized for years!) Now we have a 1 year-old son and he loves to have it read to him over and over. It's a wonderful book for new readers!"
1,Very poor adaptation of a wonderful book,"We have the ""original"" Fireman Small which is a GREAT book. However this adaptation into a board book makes no sense, the gentle drawings have been blown up, the colors intensified and the chopped ""story"" does not flow.It is not worth purchasing. Wait until your little one is old enough to appreciate the original paperback version (our son was 2)and savour that one then."
3,same book different title,Please see my review for Tae Kwon Do Basics which is the exact same book with different title.
4,Best of Business Card Design 6,"This is a fun compilation that has lots of inspirational ideas... whether its logos, business card shapes and papers, color combos, etc. It was published in 2004 but in 2008, I do not find it to be outdated."
3,Good Resource,There are some nice business cards and some pretty average cards in here. This book is a good resource to have for business cards.
