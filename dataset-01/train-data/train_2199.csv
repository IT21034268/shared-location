1,Died after 14 months of careful use,Just stopped working in the middle of a cut.Cleaned and oiled after every use. No drops or mistreatment. Product just stopped turning on.
2,Died after a little over 6 months,had this for a little over half a year and then it died. It was great while it worked but then it just wouldn't turn on today. I should have paid attention to the other reviews on this product warning about the product's short lifespan...
3,"""Ultra Close-Cutting""","Note, this is meant only for ultra close cutting. The attachments don't go beyond 3/8 inch length. The box makes that very clear, but I didn't think that was very clear in the product description."
5,Great Buy!,"I bought this set of clippers after going through a couple of cheaper ones, it gives you a skin tight fade and works great for sculping and shaping your beard. The only thing I don't like about this is that the clippers don't have a plastic cover for them to keep them oiled when you store them, other than that it is a perfect set!"
4,very good clippers,"I had a set of clippers just like these and they lasted for years. I used them constantly for beard trimming and shaving. They cut very close and they are very easy to use. My old ones recently died so I ordered the same set as a replacement. The price was very good, shipping was free and they arrived in two days. Way to go Amazon.com. You guys are the best!!"
3,Not as good as our previous Andis,After 6 years the blades on our Andis trimmer were dull. (go figure) We bought this one to replace it. It cuts fine but becomes hot after awhile. The old trimmer did not do this.
4,good product for the money,"the description said it came with a 1/2 inch adapter but it only went up to 3/8ths. Other than that, it didn't pull or snag my hair and was done shaving my head in 10 min."
4,cutting your own hair,"Cord a little short. I dropped it the first day and the 3/8 comb snaped off. I recieved another set of combs right away, no charge, from the company. Service was great. Seems to be working okay, strong motor, good for the price."
2,Unreliable,"1. They sent me a different model then picture.2. After second time of using it, they stopped working. Wouldnt even turn on...3. The scissors didnt come with it and the bag inside was dirty, showin how used it was."
3,Looks used,"The electric shaver seems to work fine. However, it did have hairs stuck in it when we received it. Could it be used or refurb.? We will see how it works in the coming weeks"
5,I will never buy any other clippers again!,I always spent money on those cheap clippers you buy at your local drug store or at walmart and always was so upset with the way the left little hairs behind and you would have to keep cutting and cutting just to get every little hair left behind.. With these clippers its soooo easy to cut and it leaves a nice a smooth and even cut with one pass maybe two.. i love them.. never again wil i buy any other clipper.. Nice and sturdy and durable feeling. does not feel cheap and great price!! worth every penny and more!!!
2,Doesn't work well when I travel,Doesn't cut as clean and pinches my skin when I use it in my travels. This is my 4 th Andis instrument over the years so I'm not used to this.
4,Noisy but doing great job,This item works really good but shaking little more and sound loud a bit but doing job and for this price it's really good and not so heavy you can wear with you anywhere very comfortable.
5,Andis Trimmer,"It suits the purpose of purchase which is a low cost dry shaver for the beard and head. However, if you want to use it for a shape up its not as effective. You might want to consider an Andis T-outliner for a closer shave."
4,great for Shape ups!,"THis is the trimmer I was looking for! has clip sizes Smaller than 1' it has 3/8, 1/8, 1/16 and one more bigger one. This is perfect for those looking to line themselves up, or looking for a shape-up in between haircuts. This is perfect for Blowouts or fades also.If your like me and get haircuts and shape ups every few weeks, this is perfect for those inbetween time. Reason it doesn't get my 5 star rating is because after a month or so it shuts off, so you need to get a screw driver and open the blades to clean the hair out of the machines. First few times it was a pain in the butt because I couldn't find a screw driver that fit. But as far as cutting quality, it is the best!"
2,Good while it worked,"When I first got this I would have rated it 5 stars. It gets really close, really easy to clean and was a bargain. It broke after about 6 months. It's not the blade either, the motor seems to have lost the power to move the blade. I am going to try and order the professional model and am going to return this one."
2,Weak T-Trimmers,"I had these trimmers less than a year before they became unusable. Prior to that they were ok, and I mean just ok. The power of the motor is extremely low, or weak, and the blades became dull very quickly. So much so, I would have to stroke the same area two or three time before I got the desired cut. I tried adjusting the blades but that didn't help. I would not recommend these clippers for the following reasons:(1) The motor is very weak;(2) The blades became dull very quick (even after trying to adjust them); and(3) The overall life span of these clippers is relatively short, less than a year."
3,Shakes too much,"It makes my hand numb after a short time. Otherwise it works fine.Also, it seemed to me that the package had been opened before, which for a personal product like this is kinda disgusting. I just received another product from amazon (a notebook cooler) and that one was definitely opened beforehand! What is happening with amazon? One more opened product and I am done with amazon."
3,2nd purchase... no bueno.,"I actually really like the way this cuts. It almost grooms your hair like a razor blade. This would be my 2nd purchase of this kit.Concerns...First time, the clippers died out on me mid cut, and I was in Las Vegas. Luckily, I packed my backup clippers but those do not cut nearly as short as the Andis. So I was walking around Vegas with a weird looking haircut all weekend.I dont know what it is, the clippers just died and never worked again after that? I opened the device and cleaned all the hairs that got trapped inside. But it did not seem to fix the problem.My 2nd purchase was worse. In less than 4 months the clippers died out and refused to work. Again I opened the device and cleaned the trapped hair. I also tried to look for any signs of damage or over heated parts. But everything looks fine.I am not sure why it dies out and just doesn't work so quickly?Again I love these clippers, but for my 2nd purchase, they just don't last long enough for me to really enjoy them."
4,Gives a great trim/shave,"I purchased this product because I hate shaving and I was hoping this trimmer would give me a close enough ""shave"", IT DOES. It gets real close and my face looks like a shave less-than-a-day-old. I don't like the fact that it vibrates a bit much, thus 4 stars, but then again I'm done after 4 minutes so its not too bad."
1,Great Clipper Horrible Reliability,"I purchased these clippers on 1 March 2012 for many reasons, one being the reputation that Andis has, one being my barber recommended it, and one being friends that regularly use it recommended it. The clippers worked great everytime I used them, I kept them clean, never dropped it, treated it like a limited edition hall of fame baseball card... And here I am not even two months into it and the clippers have suddenly stopped working in the middle of trimming session. I'm hoping Andis will honor their warranty and fix/replace the clippers. These clippers do a great job of shaping up beard, necklines, etc, everything it advertises, just wish they lasted longer than two months! It's inconvenient to have broken clippers and wait for a solution."
1,Total junk.,"I bought this based on all the glowing reviews. And, apparently, I either received a totally different product or something's changed drastically since these reviews were written.I've been shaving my head for almost 20 years. So I'm not a stranger to a good cut.I put the guard I always use - 1/8"" - on the machine and tried to shave my head. Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Zip. It wouldn't cut. Not a single piece of hair fell from my head.I pulled out my old but faltering Wahl, turned it on and we were off to the races.Maybe this product was defective. Or maybe it's junk. I'm not sticking around to find out. I'm sending this back to Amazon pronto.And if you're in the market for a decent shaver, you might want to keep looking."
2,Not worth your money,"Hasn't performed well from day one. My own fault as I went for a cheap set instead of investing money into a model that would fulfill my needs. This model overall just feels cheap. Additionally, the blade arrived off center and remains so to this day, no matter how many times I've tried to adjust it. At times it works well enough but too often I can't tell if it's actually trimming any hair. Not worth the money, pay a little more and get a model that actually works all the time."
1,"doesn't cut, just gives you a patchy furr head","My old hair clipper broke so I got this one because it was fairly cheap and had pretty good reviews. As soon as I got it I put oil on it and started clipping. On the very flat areas of my face it seemed to cut ok, but on any curve it did nothing. I shave my head regularly but my old clipper had broken so it had gotten to maybe a quarter inch long. I tried to trim it with this clipper. I would go over the same spot over and over again and it would still be super patchy with little clumps of hair everywhere. After 10 minutes and only having a quarter of my head done, and that with still random hairs still sticking out everywhere I gave up. I borrowed a friends shaver to finish. My old clipper could clean my whole head in 2 minutes flat and it would be perfect.This thing is junk."
1,Missleading,the item is oil picture is for whole set with attachments. The title is correct but the item in picture and description.
1,Defective Product,"I've had this machine for a few weeks now, and this is only the second machine I've ever bought. There is a loud buzzing noise that makes it really hard and frustrating to have a good shave. I thought this was normal considering the price of the product. But after a few shaves, the machine stopped working altogether. I guess it was defective...so I guess I'll be looking at other brands for a new shaving machine. I'm very disappointed in the quality to say the least."
4,Pretty good,"I'm a black man who gets hair bumps frequently and simply enough, I don't get them when I use this. That said, I really think it could get a tad closer and still be effective but believe me thats not really a complaint."
3,INCOMPLETE!,"As the back cover reads, ""In order to facilitate a single, specially-priced cd, the songs ""The Great Pretender,"" and ""I Guess I'll Always Love You,"" have been removed."" HELLO??!! The main selling point of this album was the inclusion of those tracks as they were not available elsewhere! Both performances added immeasureably to the appeal of this collection, and these songs, as with Stewart's original and definitive reading of Burt Bacharach's ""That's What Friends Are For,"" have yet to reappear on subsequent retrospectives. Stick with the vinyl until Warner does this one right."
3,Interesting recipes. Difficult-to-obtain ingredients.,"If you have easy access to squab, pheasant, loin of rabbit, quail, buffalo, antelope, Mexican oregano, blackberries, poblano chiles, gualjillo chiles, serrano chiles, chile molido, chile carib, chipotles in adobo sauce, Apaloosa beans, calypso beans, Steuben yellow beans, fresh hoja santa leaf, dry aged goat cheese, smoked gouda, chanterelles, Silver Queen corn, fresh marjoarm, fresh epazota, pumpkin seeds, cumin seeds, dried blueberries, huckleberries, etc., then you might find the recipes in ""Red Sage: Contempoary American Cuisine"" the kind that will give a fresh and creative twist to your culinary endeavors. Otherwise, you are likely find very little in this book that you can put to use in your kitchen."
4,History and Recipes,"A handsome volume, filled with recipes representing the author's take on Southwestern cooking and interesting historical sidelights on the American West, this book will please those with a taste for good cooking and an interest in how our country was settled. The old pictures are awesome; the food design shots will make your mouth water.What I like best about this book is the variety of rubs and marinades. Most are used in cooking wild game, but can translate well to beef, chicken or pork. The only drawback I see is some of the recipes are very time-consuming. It would be nice if some shortcuts had been suggested, especially in the desserts department."
4,Great kitchen towels,I bought these for my wife for Christmas. She was really please with the picture and the quality of the towels. I would like to recommend these to others!
2,Not good quality,"I loved this item when I saw it online! It is so cute. But after I got it, it is kind of thin, and after one wash, it fades badly. Cant even put it out on display anymore."
2,not as ordered,ordered thesssss towel twice 1st set was not as ordered i was dissapointed (ordered from amazon. com first time. 2nd time i ordered from an indvidual and received what i ordered i am hesitant to order thru amazon.com because twice i did not receive merchandise that i ordered
1,I find it confusing!!!,"I find this book really confusing. The writing assignments are very challenging, but not in a good way. The authors seem to have picked them randomly. The format is terrible and the questions/excercises that are required are once again, confusing and not very clear."
3,Tameness is (almost) fatal in Romeo et Juliette,"This is not only the tamest of Colin Davis's three readings of Romeo et Juliette but the tamest of any version I've ever encountered. Two very good things stand out: the excellent sonics and Davis's beautiful sense of phrasing. That said, R & J is the last piece of music to need a measured, mature interpretation, which is what Davis has to offer at this point in almost everything he conducts.His chorus and soloists sing with nice flexibility, but their French is very British. The mezzo and bass soloists, as others have noted, are sound too mature and wobbly. All in all, I found myself enjoying this CD in isolaiton but found it quite pale beside other versions from James Levine (passionately romantic and my current favorite), Charles Munch, and the younger Davis himself."
1,mediocre at best,"This book is definitely NOT what you're looking for. I wish someone had stated that the source code included on the CD is INCOMPLETE. Boasting over 10,000 lines of code this book is a complete waste of time. I popped the CD into my computer, fired up Visual Studio 6.0, and they don't even have project files! You can't even load the projects let alone compile them. All in all, I would steer clear of this one."
3,Return of the Killer A's Video Collection,"As much as I love Anthrax, and would like to see everything that they have ever done released on DVD, Return of the Killer A's Video Collection is jumbled and inconsistent. That's not to say that I didn't love every minute of it! Seldom seen music videos, live concert footage in MI from the Persistence of Time tour, and humorous behind the scenes segments make this a must-have for Anthrax fans old and new. Although, it would have been better if the DVD was either a definitive collection of music videos or a live concert. This inconsistent mix put future Anthrax DVD releases (and please keep them coming) in jeopardy of rereleasing the same footage; especially on any kind of video anthology that may be down the road. Otherwise, this is a very entertaining release from a great band."
2,Puke,"If you were a fan of Anthrax between 1985 and 1991 and stopped listening to them after ""Persistence of Time,"" don't waste your money on this. Like everything else that happened to our favorite thrash and metal bands, it'll just depress you. Even fans of Anthrax after 1991 should be turned off by this DVD's poor video and audio quality. The Persistence of Time tour was one of the biggest metal tours that year, not to mention Anthrax was getting regular rotation on MTV's Headbangers Ball. They should've had plenty of money to record it right."
3,They work but i would probably choose something else,"These function but I honestly expect more from a weaver product. Most likely do to the large area provided for the see thru capability, these mounts require loctite in at least the base screws in order to remain stable. This is the first time I have needed to use loctite on a scope ring for a 22 and the directions claim that you will not need to and should not use loctite. The threads on the screws I recieved are no where near perfect and seem very prone to stripping. As one dissatisfied reviewer has already pointed out, the stainless steel does not match properly on most if not all rings. (all of the identical rings I have seen at the range have this problem).The base of my rings is bright shinny stainless while the upper ring is more of a matte brushed steel. Overall these rings function but they ain't pretty and they have a few issues that are difficult to accept when there are clearly far better options on the market."
5,Great Price and Quality,"I've put these see-thru rings on 3 rifles now, Love em !! Great fit and solid mounting with a little loctite. For those complaining about receiving these rings in ""Silver"" while the picture shows black. The item names does say ""SS""."
5,gunman,"great product, works well on my stainless steel black laminated 10/22 and they look good also, no need for a scope base they mount to the receiver"
1,boy was i wrong.,"bought this for my 10/22 takedown rifle.first, you can barely see the leaf sight so there is no point in having the see through portion, you just can't get an eye on that sight with these rings.second, the top of the rings is steel and the bottom is aluminum which just looks bad.third, with them on, the rifle with the scope would not fit in my bag...i know i could have purchased a different ring to make it fit my bag, however with the other problems... well, i thought i was buying a good product, boy was i wrong..."
5,a gift of serenity to yourself or your friends,I just returned from Bhutan where I found this book in our hotel. I immediately ordered it for myself and family then.............for every one of my friends!!! The mindfullness of our trip was captured in these pages.The daily messages are timelessand pertinent to all faiths. A great way to start every day. A great gift for anyone on your list.
3,Starts out great but gets rushed.,"I read the three books when I was a kid and I found The Complete Book of Swords at a thrift store for a great price and thought I'd read it again. The books are a quick read and there are parts that are really amazing. However, there are just as many parts that are very lacking. The end to the books is one such part. It really feels like a deadline was approaching and the author threw something together quickly to end the series. The real unfortunate thing is that the books could have been longer and given more time to each sword without losing any of the readability of the book. In the end, it is a quick read and entertaining. I just wish it would have been a little more detailed and had a better ending."
5,An engaging and entertainingly symbolic book.,The Complete Book of Swords captures you imagination and draws you right in. But what seperates this book from other engaging fantasy novels is its incredible use of mythology and realism. It acts as a satire for the real world and our views about dieties. This is a must read for fantasy novel fans!
5,Saberhagen is still impressive.,"Don't start reading unless you have time to finish the ENTIRE series, because you won't want to stop before then. This wonderful book will get you started on a trip that will be impossible to return from. Simply enough written for anyone to understand and enjoy, this work will also cause you to think of much more complicated things; possibly changing your views of our world, but it will definitely keep you entertained."
5,473 study guide,This is the second study guide I purchase by T.W. Parnell and I did very well on the first test. After using and praticicing I found that I was very prepared for the Postal Exam. I highly recommend to anyone to purchase this study Guide
4,Excellent Guide,"Using this study guide, I achieved a passing score on the 473e exam with ease. The practice exams are quite good. I highly recommend this book."
4,Good guide to study from for the exam,"The study guide took a little longer than I thought it would to be shipped out but possibly there was a lot of orders for this book at the same time. Otherwise, the guide is very efficient where the level of difficulty increases with each exam in the book."
5,Original Postal Exam 473 & 473-C Study Guide,Excellent toll to pass the 473 Exam. I do recommend it!!!!
5,Good study guide,Nice book really told it how it was although I am not so sure about the method for the memorizing part that is something you have to find your own niche. Good book I scored well on the first attempt it was worth the money.
5,The very best Postal study guide!!!,"I actually bought three books to help me study for the Postal exam. This book was the best. It has the most current information, the most practice exams and great helpful hints. I scored very well on my postal exam and my thanks to Mr. Parnell for writing this book and keeping his books up to date with the Postal hiring process. Of course there is no guarantee with my getting hired but at least I studied, practiced the sample Postal tests and was confident when my test date came. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in scoring well on a postal exam. I also purchased Mr. Parnell's Timed Practice Test Audio CD and this helped tremendously in timing my practice tests. Best of Luck to future Postal exam takers."
1,"unable to use it. There was no indication that it is a ""district 2"" DVD","unable to use it. There was no indication that it is a ""district 2"" DVD and therefore I cannot use it on my DVD player"
5,Finally found this wonderful movie,I looked and looked for this movie ever since I rented it years ago. I was very much pleased with the condition of the movie and will cherish it for a lifetime!!
4,The Luzhin Defence,"If you are an avid chess player, than this movie would be of interest to you! Good story although more on the adult side in nature. After all it is a bit of a love story as well as an interesting chess drama!! Beautiful setting as well as a nice period piece! Good acting and an all around good movie!!"
5,One Of The Best Movies In Chess Ever Made,"Very good plot, magnificent scenic views, superb acting of both John Turturro & Emily Watson, very worthwhile to watch, great movie overall!"
3,Unique,"I thought this was an odd movie. Luzhin in a champion chess player. He's at a tournament and he meets Natalia. They are smitten with each other and he proposes marriage. To say they are in love doesn't seem right. Her mother becomes upset at the idea of them together and says in so many words. Natalia always wants to take care of animals and people since she was a little girl.He's very strange and no explanation is given. I'm thinking he has Asperger Syndrome. Flashbacks to his childhood shows him as a boy that doesn't talk much. He doesn't fit in at school and is told by the headmaster he needs to go someplace more suitable.Let's just say this doesn't end well. I bet the novel by Vladimir Nabokov is better than this movie. If this sounds interesting, I suggest to read the book instead."
3,"Good in places, but disappointing","The Johnson/Dunning teaming on the CD, Celtic Legends: Bard & Warrior was a delight in the celtic music genre. I looked forward to this follow-up CD, perhaps with a little too much anticipation because I was somehat disappointed. Use of the spoken word with annoying chants at what appears to be odd times detract from the music. Stick to Celtic Legends, and hope their next CD is better."
3,Disappointing sound,Chesky's remaster of Earl Wild's recording of the Grieg Piano Concerto is gorgeous - warm and detailed. The Rachmaninov remasters however are stripped bare - they're too clean. Piano sound is good but the orchestra sounds old and shrill because the warmth has gone. Surprising and disappointing. The Chandos remasters actually sound better (and all the concertos and rhapsody are on 2CDs). Performance of course is brilliant.
2,Not even a G11 will fit that well,"This bag is very portable, but doesn't fit my Panasonic GF1 with pancake lens. I don't think it will fit a G11 either. It's simply for someone with a point and shoot that could probably fit in a pocket or purse anyway rendering the bag useless. It's a truly bad design. For only $12 though, I really don't regret the purchase. I'll give it away to a friend."
3,"Average Goa Trance, A good introduction","I bought this cd in order to introduce myself to goa trance cheaply and quickly. While none of the tracks are all that great, these cds allowed me to find out that this is the genre of music for me. If you are already well acquianted with goa, do not buy this. If you are looking to test the goa waters, buy this or anything by Astral Projection, Hallucinogen, Pleiadians, or Infected Mushroom."
4,Power!,"Jorn is the David Coverdale of the 2000's. Such a great album to notice their deep Whitesnake influence. One of my favorite Jorn records due to a great production. The sound has great quality to it, and you really get a good example of Jorn's power and range in his vocals. While there are many Jorn albums to choose from, chock this one up as a great, lengthy Metal record to jam out to."
4,Great Surprise!!,"I have purchased this product in a specialty pet store, in a much smaller bottle, for a higher price. What a GREAT surprise it was to find it here, for the price I paid.This product is wonderful for my Schnauzer's skin and coat. He had such dry skin, but when I put (1 squirt) this, twice a day in his food, he stopped itching, and his coat became shiny again.THANK YOU!!!"
1,Worked and then it didn't...what a disaster!,"I bought this for my purebred Golden, who is approx 5 1/2 yrs old. He must have been overbred because he has skin issues and arthritis at such a young age (they've been happening for awhile). I feed him HIGH quality dog food and also wanted to give him additional help with his skin issues so I purchased another brand of canine salmon oil at my local (name brand, very large co) pet store. He loved it and it seemed to help his skin and coat, so I figured I'd buy this large bottle to save $. What a mistake! This worked in the beginning for both he and his pal (she's a Golden mix), until one day he started getting diarrhea! So, I took him off it, but then she started getting it too a few weeks later. So, now I've got a half bottle of this and it's useless. In addition, there seems to be something weird with the pump because the oil oozes out. YUCK...what a mess! I threw it away and will go back to the ""good"" stuff at my big box pet store."
3,This ain't no REAL street fighting game!,"I bought this game solely because it had Street Fighter characters in it. Little did I know that there are only four buttons at your disposal. The ""L"" buttons are totally useless, as they are merely combinations of the aforementioned four buttons.I gave this 3 stars only because the characters are interesting and their moves are exciting to watch. However, the A.I. is, of course, a cheeser. Expect to be helplessly and inexplicably put into a grab move, despite the fact that you are too far away to be reached. Also, if you pick Akuma, you are forced to fight alone in Arcade mode. Meaning, if the computer has 4 players, you must fight all four alone in what turns out to be a survival mode.If you want a real street fighting game with Street Fighter characters, stick with the Street Fighter Alpha series."
5,Classic!!,Buy this game for your collection. This is a good game it is hard to find and it has great replay value. Capcom and SNK need to make a newer version of this game. You will not be disappointed.
4,capcom vs snk,each time capcom have released their next 2d fighting game in the street fighter genre. its always been better than the last. This is the best game in their playstation series. If you are a fan of both SNK and capcom you are going to love this having your favorite character lose to another character in the oposing universe is something you just dont want to see happen. The graphics are great. Classic tunes from both companies are in it. The game play is a little tighter and hits harder than street figher alpha 3. Akuma is waiting for you if your good enough. I would have made the endings better. They should have given individual endings for each character. There are 3 available endings all up.
4,dyzoeman is wrong,DYZOEMAN IS WRONG I'VE PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE AND IT'S FUN IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. CAPCOM VS SNK PRO IS JUST LIKE X-MEN VS STREET FIGHTER AND MARVEL VS CAPCOM I'VE PLAYED ALL THREE AND THE'RE REALLY FUN IF YOU'RE INTO FIGHTING GAMES.
4,True Faith in God!,"This book is a must read for anyone who is involved in the Pentecostal movement. It show's the power of God and how it is manifested in his time. However, please note that the Lord's power is being manifested everywhere as I write this note. There great revivals going on all over the world. May the peace of our Lor Jesus Christ be with all of you always.Definitely a good read."
5,Rockin' good song,"I'm not much of an INXS fan, but this song rocks. Perfect song about the city that rocks."
5,Pretty Vegas,"I watched rock star inxs and was so happy that they picked JT. He will bring just more perfection to a perfect group. Looking forward to the new cd from them. In the meantime, i love this song"
2,!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?,"I really don't understand. This song is a mediocre borderline country pop song that isn't all that great. I mean it's not terrible, but it's simply a very generic top 40 pop/country/rock 3 and half minute radio darling. You really can't give this 5 stars because if this is as good as it gets then music is truly in a sad place."
3,DVD Only,"Be careful, if you are expecting the Book & DVD combo, this is not the right product.This is for the DVD ONLY."
3,Great performances disappointing remasters,Chesky's remaster of Earl Wild's recording of the Grieg Piano Concerto is gorgeous - warm and detailed. The Rachmaninov remasters however are stripped bare - they're too clean. Piano sound is good but the orchestra sounds old and shrill because the warmth has gone. Surprising and disappointing. The Chandos remasters actually sound better - warmer and beefier (and all the concertos and rhapsody are on 2CDs). Performance of course is brilliant.
5,aint that much distruction,"thug 2 is sweet. its called the world distruction tour but there isnt that much distruction. all the create modes are back including create a graphic. you make a graphic and then use it to tag walls. for what is of the distrution you get to skate in more places. what sucks in the story mode is that you cant choose what team you're gonna be on. first you go to Tony, then Bam, and back to Tony. remember in the first thug game when eric was there well hes on Bams team. instead of cars they have scooters and go karts. in this game you're not just you. you can be up to 4 people. the pro, guest, secret man, and you. comparing to the last game this game is short unless you're on sick. it dont matter what system you have just buy it."
4,thug 2,i loved this game!!!! I thought the secret charactors were cool!!!! i thought everything was cool but 1 thing. I beat it in 1 week and 1 day but i still play it because i unlocked all those characters. overall id say 4.5 but i put 4 because there is no 4.5. Id recomend this game and 1 other thing it should be 40 dollars instead of 30 becuase its pretty cool
1,booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,This video games stinks the graphics stinks. It was a high way robbery ho ho ho ho h oh ho ho hoho
4,Tony Hawk Underground 2,I bought this game for my son and he absolutely LOVES playing it...my daughter likes it too. The one thing that I don't like is some of the language the characters use.
4,Great Game,This overall is a very good game. I would recommend it to those who like skate boarding and some humor. The only bad part is the game is to short. I can beat Story Mode in 2 hours which makes it sort of dissapointing. I hope my review helped you
3,"Decent game, but no cheats?","The game is fun, but without a cheat available to unlock levels, this game is worthless. My son likes exploring the levels, but he is too young to ""complete the goals"". A level code would be great, but none exist. I have scoured the internet and all the codes are bogus. I tried to complete several ""goals"" and a few are extremely hard (and annoying). I cannot get out of the Boston level on Story Mode (skating that moving RV half pipe is frustrating!)and may just quit trying soon. Games like Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks makes me want to play for HOURS until I finish, but this game is fine in small 30 minute doses. The graphics are good as is most of the music. Character faces are a bit creepy (does no one blink?) but you can tell who is who for the most part. Worth 20 bucks, but not a cent more."
4,An indictment of the rich and the super-rich,"As the title implies, this book deals with the current class war being waged against the working and middle classes. This book gives us a glimpse into the inner workings of the current capitalist system and how it is rigged against wage earners, which is essentially 99% of the entire population. The book is filled with interesting details that put things into perspective. We learn, for example, that the three richest people in the United States have as much wealth as the bottom 100 million people. Furthermore, taxes paid by rich individuals and corporations have been decreasing over the past decades and the working/middle classes have seen their taxes increase. Most people who view themselves as middle class tend to think that they are ""upwardly mobile"" but the truth is that very few make it to the very top of the economic ladder and end up living from paycheck to paycheck."
5,Soldering Tip,This was the only soldering tip that fit my soldering iron... NO ONE ELSE had it. I was very happy when i found it on amazon. Im glad someone still carries them. It works great. Just soldered two hobby PC boards with swiftness and ease.
1,Absolutely abysmal,"This has got to be the worst movie I've seen in a very, very long time, and is probably among the worst 2 or 3 I've ever seen. Ever. And I've watched ""Dark Harvest 3"" and ""Dorm of the Dead,"" people, so I've seen bad. The kid sister does nothing but play the vapid blond and scream (I hope she was playing), and the scenes between the boy hero and his love interest are actually painful to watch. The dialogue throughout is borderline vomit-inducing. I haven't been able to decide whether it's the bad writing or the horrible acting that were to blame for all of those things, and have decided it really doesn't matter. The whole film looked like it was shot on a home video camera, and the parts that were supposed to be suspenseful left me rolling my eyes. I gave this one star, because giving it less wasn't an option."
1,Don't waste your money!,This product did not work for us at all. Our dog in fact enjoyed licking it off anything we put it on which encourged more chewing.
3,People rave but...,"People rave about this, but we have a puppy and can't figure out how to use it. So I spray it on my hand and our pup doesnt come near where we are and listens, so if you take the time, it is awesome"
2,Just works for the moment,"I got this thinking it works on anything you spray it on, but beware, it only works while it is still wet. Once it dries, which is fairly quickly, the taste seems to no longer affect my dog. He hates the bottle and the taste makes him jump back, but he also knows the taste will be gone soon, so he will wait for a minute and go at it again. I'm thinking the best way to get dogs to stop biting and chewing is to train it very strictly or put it in obedience school if you can afford to."
2,My Boxador started to like it!,"My Boxer and Lab mix chewed on everything, both breeds are notorious to be horrible chewers. Although the product worked on table legs.... that was it. The puppy would lick my hands after application and lick the table legs, and then attempt to chew my hands again. Thank god she just turned 9 weeks old and is starting to obey commands for not biting and chewing."
5,great product,Great product have used I for years. For naughty dogs that like to chew things they should not. Great for puppies and adult dogs.
4,Make sure you shake it before using,"Great price for the amount you get. I have used it six or seven times on the dog now and it does not stain the furniture or the carpet.Make sure you shake it before use - otherwise you just get an alcohol taste. (yes, I have tasted it) ;-)"
2,Didn't stop my Rottie at all,"My Rottie went though a very long teething/chewing phase as a puppy and of course liked to chew on expensive things like oriental rugs. I tried everything with no luck at all - nothing seemed to even slow her down. I was so sure that the Bitter Apple would work - unfortunately, I learned that some dogs actually LIKE the taste of Bitter Apple and mine happens to be one of them. That said, about 75% of the folks I have talked with swear by this product and have had great results. If you happen to be one of the unlucky folks whose dog doesn't mind the taste, try using red pepper instead."
3,Standard Poodle likes it now!,"We thought that we had finally found the holy grail! Our bored Standard (since our daughter went to college) has a licking problem and his saliva turns his white fur brown. We have tried more exercise, a couple of different sprays and a few home recipes all to no avail. The day this came and we first applied it, Harry took one sniff, a short lick and immediately turned away from the area YEAHHHH! It only took him about 1 week to get used to the smell and taste and now he has learned to tolerate it. Back to the drawing board for us :-(....."
1,Dog Spray,"For anyone who has used this and gotten good results, PLEASE tell us how. I think our dog actually likes the taste and chews more where it was sprayed. If I am using it wrong, please tell me what to do as I think this product is a waste of time and money."
2,"Mmmm, Tasty!","I bought this to keep our Labrador from chewing on house plants, a cedar chest, the baseboards, his bed, and the door mat. I saturated the stuff after a few sprays didn't work. The house plants are mangled, the cedar chest needs repair, his bed has holes in it, and the mat is ripped to shreds. It adds a zesty flavor to the stuff he likes to chew.He's teething and he's bored. The only things that have worked are keeping everything away from him, a constant eye on him, and keeping him busy. New toys are helpful. Grannick's Bitter Apple, not so much."
1,didn't work for me,I purchased this based on the reviews in hopes that it would discourage my whippet from chewing things up. Unfortunately it did not work at all. My dog didn't slow down for a second. It was the same with or without this product.
2,It's OK,"I guess I put too much faith into this product. Our dog will stop for a couple of minutes once I spray it on furniture, but will chew again after a couple of hours. You might as well use vinegar and other solutions to get your dog to stop chewing items in the house. I heard you can try it on your dog as well, but I don't think I will."
1,Was a waste of money,My German Shepherd is not deterred by this. I can't even smell this when I apply it. It might as well be water. Years ago I used a spray for another shepherd. It was a citrus smell. It only took once. I wish I could remember the name of that product.
5,Works great and good value!!!,"My Golden Retriever loves to chase his tail when he gets excited. I have been using this spray for 9+ months on him and its been very effective in getting him to stop chewing on his tail. I spray it 3-4 times on his tail and he stops immediately after smelling/tasting it. It stays on his tail for a good couple days as well - which means I don't have to spray it every day. He doesn't chew on furniture very often but I have found this to be very effective for that as well.Also, one bottle 16 ounce lasted me 8 months which is a great value for money."
1,Does nothing,"It does nothing to stop my cat from chewing and biting. The cat is afraid of the spray it self, but doesn't mind the flavor and keeps biting back."
2,My dog likes it???,"My beagle always goes on the couch even when he's not supposed to, so we thought spraying this stuff would keep him off. Let's just say I'm pretty sure we hated the smell more than he did! It certainly kept us off the couch, but did it work for our dog? No. He goes on it now more than he did before!"
2,Dog loves it!,"This is actually a true story, I have to keep my sheltie in a downstairs bathroom because he gets into trouble. He started nibbling on the wall of the bathroom because that's just how he is so I bought this bitter apple stuff to spray on the wall, but when I applied it he loved ths stuff and when I came home from work he actually chewed all the way thru the wall and found him lose in the house when I returned, in addition he jumped up on the counter to get the bitter apple bottle and chewed the top off and ate all of the ""yucky"" stuff inside, this is not a joke. So the moral is, if you are going to buy bitter apple to keep your dog from eating things, make sure he does not love bitter apples first!!!"
2,There's good news and bad news,"The good news is my boyfriend tried some and said it's gross. I also thought it smelled too much like rubbing alcohol to be pleasant.The bad news is my cats don't mind it so much. They don't like it, but it doesn't repel them the way I had hoped. I sprayed some on the plants. Small Cat kept eating plants. Sprayed some on a towel. Fat Cat slept on the towel.I have no knowledge of the cat palette, but I would say Bitter Apple had absolutely no effect on them. They didn't like it; they didn't hate it."
1,ineffective,"it is totally ineffective. if the dog has itching skin he will scratch and lick no matter what. i already tried this bitter apple spray, best vet hot spot relief, virbac cortisoothe shampoo, benadryl and zyrtec and nothing has worked."
1,Doesn't work,Plain old amonia works better. I'm trying to keep the neighbor dogs out of our trash. This isn't the product for that. I tried. lol
2,I wish this worked,"We recently got a maltese/yorkie mix puppy, who chews EVERYTHING. He also bites and chases feet, which has become a major issue and is PAINFUL! Bought this stuff hoping the feet chasing would end- sprayed my shoes and bottoms of pants. He immediately sniffed the air and kind of backed away, however, after this stuff dried (which was in seconds), he continued to bite my feet/chase my pant legs. So in short, for me it worked when wet, but once this stuff dries, nothing. The search for a method to end my puppy's biting continues!"
2,Doesn't work,This stuff didn't do anything for my dogs!!!!!! It was a waste of money. I still have it because I don't use it.
2,Still chewing what I spray,Didn't seem to make much difference to an 8 month old lab/airdale pup. Anyone have anything better that they would recommend?
1,Didn't work on the carpet,I have an Italian Greyhound that likes to find the seam in a carpet and pull it so she unravels the carpet. I got this hoping I could spray areas and she would leave it alone. I have light colored carpet and I didn't want to have to put chili pepper all over. Well she didn't like the smell in the bottle so I thought that was promising but when I sprayed it she didn't care and kept pulling at the carpet. When you read the bottle is sounds more like it is to keep them from licking them selves.
1,Not effective for me,I hoped to use the product to discourage my dog from chewing his feet. For all the good it did I could have been spraying his feet with distilled water
1,Our beagle finds it pretty tasty,"We got this thinking it might keep our beagle puppy from chewing on table legs, clothes hamper, shoes, etc. Unfortunately, he's decided it's pretty tasty. We spray it on something and he'll lick it off."
1,Unfortunately Didn't Work,Bought this product because our dog was chewing up our resin/ratan outdoor patio furniture. We went through 2 bottles and it didn't stop him at all! We had better luck with hot pepper & chili powder than with this product. Bummer........we were really hoping it would solve the problem.
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, our dog liked the taste, or at the very least, wasn't deterred from licking at all. Further, the spray contains a fairly high level of alcohol (the same type found in rubbing alcohol, and thus in the event that there is an open sore, it will sting the animal (fortunately, in our case, that wasn't a concern).Vendor was prompt, and for some, this may work"
3,Sometimes works,I feel like the spray action is scarier to my pet than the actual taste. He'll come back in an hour and go right back to doing what he was doing.
2,Sort of works.,"First of all. The spray doesn't come out like a mist. Its limited to about a 4 inch distance since the liquid comes out in a forced dripping sort of way. Other than that it works, but I would like it to actually spray to cover a wide area like cables and wires and not drip out."
3,Doesn't work on Malamute,"We have an Alaskan Malamute puppy who goes nuts for this stuff. We put the bottle on the coffee table and I caught him trying to chew on the cap to get it open. I tried spraying it in his mouth when I caught him chewing on some things and he did not react like he hated it; in fact, he started licking at the bottle. I had to return it. Make sure you spray some in your dog's mouth when he does something bad, before spraying this stuff on your cords and other possessions, in case he likes it! I gave it three stars because we've had a few dogs over the years and the others hated it (all except for a shepherd mix), so it was mostly successful as a training aid. It just won't work for all dogs!UPDATE: After trying messy hot sauce (which he also loves), and all sorts of bitter agents, I finally turned to vinegar. He can't stand it! If you do not mind the smell, put some vinegar in a spray bottle. It works and it's cheap!"
4,Works for our Puppy,Our house rescued a puppy from the pound and she was 9 weeks old. She had the bad habit of wanting to chew on everything because she was still teething her baby ones. So we picked this up and it's saved our furniture and some household items that were under attack when we didn't keep a close eye on her. She seems to have learned quickly from the bad taste it leaves on things and so many things have been left alone since the initial spray down. However we've found this stuff to be a little harsh for our hands to teach her not to nip while playing or for attention.
3,Has it's benefits,"I bought this to help train the kittens not to jump on the kitchen counters. Unfortunately this did not work for my kittens. They would jump up right after spraying the counter tops and not care. This method would only work if the cat is jumping up there and then likes their paws. Mine like to explore for hidden treasures.I did however find it very useful where the Christmas tree was concerned, hence the 3 stars. I found my kittens chewing on the artificial tree one morning and figured what did I have to lose. Within minutes of spraying the tree one of my kittens tried sneaking over to chew on it some more. This time he DID NOT like the taste at all. After a few times of icky taste, he never tried again."
4,Effective but with time limit,I tried using this product and it works.But the effect does not really last long as I expect.
3,Just okay,"One of my dogs has allergies and gets bumps all over his back. My other dog licks him so I used Bitter Apple to stop the behavior. It has slowed her down some, but she still licks him despite the nasty taste. I think you have to use the product pretty frequently to make it useful."
2,Doesn't Work,I have used this with TWO dogs and neither of them stopped chewing because of it. This has not worked for a 3 month old pit bull mix or a VERY mellow 2 year old doberman with a bad habit of licking her paws 'til they bleed and are raw. This stuff DOES NOT work. At all. Don't waste your money.
3,Only slightly effective this time,I have used this product in the past with great success. It has been 12 years but my 2 previous German Shepherds were trained with the use of Bitter Apple. It worked so great I didn't even finish an 8 oz bottle training 2 dogs. Our newest GSD is 14 weeks old and wants to chew everything. I bought this and he is barely affected. He goes right back to chewing the same area when it dries. I am almost through my 16 oz and 8 oz bottles. I guess all dogs are very different. Be cautious when ordering that you get the kind for the specific pet you need it for. I found out the hard way there is one for small furry animals. I wondered if I got the wrong formula in my current bottles? It was previously so very effective and now....nothing? But this stuff is great in the fact it dries clear and non staining and can be sprayed nearly anywhere safely.
3,Minimal Success,"It might work for older puppies or some not as headstrong as our own, but we had very limited success with this product as a chew reducer for our boxer. It does help for training, but don't expect to spray it on something and then not worry!"
1,Dosen't work :(,"I saw the reviews and was hopping our little Pug might not be as tough as some of the other dogs....Well either he is, or this stuff just sucks. In any event it has yet to drive him away from anything, he sniffs a little longer, but that's it."
2,My Puppy Loves this!,"Maybe I have a weird puppy, but my 3 month old ShihTzu loves the taste of this spray. We were having an issue with him chewing on the legs of our kitchen table. When we spray the table legs with this spray, he goes after the legs even more. We even tried spraying it on his waste to keep him from licking it, but that didn't work either. Since it doesn't work, I'm not sure it's good for anything else, so I guess I'll throw it away unless I can use it as a glass cleaner or something! Maybe some puppies don't like the taste, but I don't think I'd recommend it to another ShihTzu owner."
2,Slightly bitter apple,"The product was shipped promptly, and I received it in just a couple days. Unfortunately however it was not enough to stop my dog from licking her foot. I suppose she will have to deal with the cone a while longer."
4,Seemed to work on digging spots!,"I got this for my boxer mix who has started digging holes. As soon as I spray it in the holes, he leaves the hole alone. I am pleased with this product and it does what it says. WILL DEFINITELY be buying more."
5,Works Great,"This product works really great and doesn't seem to stain or anything. Our Cockapoo puppy is in her chewing phase and we were having all kinds of problems with her chewing things. So we bought this and it works well. She sometimes even makes this cute little whine when we spray things complaining that we're taking her fun away.I've found that for things like leashes and shoes that rub against other things all day this wears off quickly and you need to spray them every 2-4 days, but for things like cords, cables and the bottoms of chairs I haven't had to respray as the only thing rubbing against them and wearing off the spray is the puppy who's no longer doing so."
1,My dog actually likes the taste,"My dog was eating TV remotes left and right. We tried putting them away but as home theaters take 12 dozen remotes to operate these days we'd forget and then our puppy would destroy one. I bought this as a back-up plan. Turns out he enjoys the flavor, I caught him licking it off the remote while wagging his tail. He's a beast of a dog though."
5,Stopped mouthing after 3 sprays,"Our purpose in trying this spray was our new addition...a 5-month-old lab/newfoundland mix puppy. When she got excited, she would open her mouth and put it on us, not really clamp down or anything, but you'd feel her teeth. Not a good habit to get into. We tried re-directing her behavior, ignoring her, and even flicking her in the nose to get her to stop. None of these things worked. I went out and got this spray. The next time she persisted to ""mouth"", I shot a small squirt into her mouth. She hated it. She instantly stopped and went to lay down in her bed. After doing this 2 more times, we don't even have to spray it. We just show her the bottle and she stops. Great stuff."
1,My dog doesn't mind the taste,"Bought this so my dog would stop licking her paws excessively. It didn't work, she actually seems to enjoy the taste of Bitter Apple."
3,"Keeps my dog away, though may not work for all!","My mom tried using this on her new Belgian Sheepdog puppy's leash. The dog had no problem ignoring it and chewing right through the thing. I have used it on furniture and leashes to deter our teething Labrador puppy, and it works great... temporarily. When it is wet, she hates the smell and hates the taste even more. After about 12 hours, though, it's dry, the smell is gone, and she's back to chewing whatever we sprayed.The bottom line is, it works on some dogs, but not others, and you have to try it to be sure. I think it's a good idea to take a chance, though, since if it does work, it's a huge relief to be able to use it as a quick fix when you're just too tired to do a training session to distract the puppy from chewing your favorite chair."
3,Dog Deterrent-Bitter Apple Spray,"This product appears to give best canine results in conjunction with a well-defined behavior modification program. If you're counting on just this spray to stop your anxious dog's mayhem, you will be disappointed and your possesions will continue to be used as chew toys. Remember what the product label states: this is a deterrent, not total prevention."
3,Good and Not Good,"The good about this is that my older dog stopped chewing the end of the coffee table after we sprayed it. It also kept him off the bed. There was never any problem with staining or anything. For my younger dog however, she took a few sniffs and actually licked it. I even sprayed it near her and she jumped back but then smelled it and licked it off. I don't know why. I suggest you might want to purchase the smaller 8oz. until you know how your dog will react."
4,Other use,"I used this on my 5 Year old shi-tzu when he was a puppy and it seemed to work well, I had some left in the cabinet, I found some flea bites on him (Which is a whole other issue within itself!) however this spray brought immediate relief to his hot spots and itching all the other sprays did nothing, just thought I share this happy accident"
1,Didn't work,"I tried this on my 10 year old poodle/schnauzer mix after she developed sores on her belly and inner legs after the groomer scraped her with dull clippers. Not only did it not stop her from licking the sores, it made her throw up. I finally had to get her on antibiotics and put an e-collar on her for a week. I was really hoping the bitter apple would deter her but it didn't. Of course, this is a dog who likes Jalapeno sauce."
5,The best chew deterrent!,"We've tried other chew deterrent sprays, but this is the only one that works for us. He will lick off other products, but he won't go near something once it's been sprayed with Bitter Apple."
2,PUPPY LOVED IT,Referred to this product and bought it to deter a 12 week old Shih Tzu from chewing and biting. She really enjoyed it and wasn't stopped one bit. So much for a $ 10 bottle of deterrent.
3,Grannick's Bitter Apple for Dogs,"Seems to be a deterrent to keep dogs from biting and tearing apart their bed, as weel as wood furniture."
5,Amazing. My Shih Tzu isn't after cords and furniture legs anymore.,"I just started using this today, and so far, so good. Bella (the Shih Tzu) saw that I was lowering the cords I have meticulously been unplugging every time I have to leave her unattended, so naturally she got curious and went over to taste them. HA! Sputter, Yuck!, ICK! She seems to be cured of her desire to chew the objects I have coated in Bitter Apple. She also had a habit of chewing up the edges of her indoor potty pad so I soaked those edges down and now, no problem (and she does ""go"" there, just no chewing.) This stuff is great. Works on everything I've tried it on: books, computer and lamp cords, furniture, decorative bed pillows, and the edges of bed coverings near the floor that she sometimes goes after."
4,Like a Charm,"I bought this because our 12 weeks old Boxer pup was chewing on all of our rugs and wicker baskets. I applied a decent amount to each and right away I could tell he wanted no part of whatever we sprayed. I always sprayed it at the dog if he started to nip a my kids. All I need to do now is show him the bottle and he usually backs off. However, my rugs did need to have an application every day which becomes expensive. Overall, I highly recommend this for new pups."
2,My golden doesn't seem to understand what this product is for.,"I have a very picky eating golden retriever, and there are only a few things that she will put in her mouth that she should not, like my briefcase. I bought this with the expectation that it would be so repugnant to dogs' senses that they simply would rather stay away from it. That is clearly not the case, in my experience at least. I hosed down my briefcase, and I mean literally soaked this thing in the bitter spray and laid it next to my dog. At first she wasn't paying any attention, but when she noticed it was there, she immediately began to chew, and the spray did not deter her from going at it like a ribeye. I'm sure it will work for some dogs, just like all products on the shelf do something for somebody, it just didn't work for us."
4,More than just about the Clintons...,"I did buy the book, expecting more attacks on the Right Wing who tried to overturn the results of the 1996 Election (oh, by the way...Scoreboard, fellas), but I took more away from the book than that. This book has actually touched me, especially Mr. Carville's revelations about how he got his start, and what a rough start it was.The book is about the concept of loyalty, how hard it is, how trying it can be. Of course, most of Mr. Carville's experiences are going to come out of the Clinton Debacle, but he goes through bits and pieces of his life, and I felt I learned something from it.Now, I can't recommend it fully to Republicans, but even I would tell them if they could get past the Clinton part, there is something worthwhile here. Good read."
3,Decent but not on the level of Mr. Carville's other efforts,"Stickin': The Case for Loyalty is well worth reading for any of the James Carville fans out there. I am a Republican but I enjoy the passion and loyalty that Mr. Carville displays in his books and TV interviews. I am a huge fan of his other books which I strongly suggest to anyone. However Stickin' left a bad taste in my mouth. For one it really gives no new reasons for why Carville ""stuck"" with President Clinton. We all know the story. Two, it rarely invokes the sense of humor that we expect and enjoy. Read We're Right They're Wrong, ...And the Horse He Came in One, and All's Fair first. If you're hooked try this one."
1,Poor Book and a boring subject,"Well, here is a book that was an utter disappointment soon after page 20. His past effort, All's Fair, was good, but here he has strayed from good writing and a good story. The harsh language and crude comments did nothing for me and made me grow cold toward the book. James should be loyal to his craft of a political consultant, instead of trying to be a writer that uses pedestrain language and re-hashed ideas."
2,Not a Political Book,"This is largely my fault for not reading reviews carefully, but if you're looking for a book with great Political insight like Love, War, and Running For President...this is NOT the book for you.While it's an entertaining book and I like Carville's style, I wish there was more info about WHAT Carville did for Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal and HOW he went about doing it, than hearing all his views on loyalty.I just wanted something different out of this book and don't be surprised by what you DON'T get"
3,Good Insight,"Good insight on how James views loyality. I found the sections on religon and stickin it to the enemy a little lacking and, in some cases, down-right uninformed. I really enjoyed reading about his family though. Anyone who would teach their kids the family is worth stickin for and to can't be all bad. Thanks for your effort James."
3,Good...but he's reaching!,"I'm a big Carville supporter...he sticks to his positions and his friends and you have to respect a little loyalty in this day and age. However, he got a little off track trying to meet page requirements or something and went on about his loyalty to certain brands and places (kickbacks anyone?) to where I started thinking what REALLY is the purpose of this book? Advertising for his friends or making a statement? The book starts off great and to the point about why he's loyal to his positions and his friends but slowly gets off course mid-way through. I mean, personnally I bought the book to see what made him so loyal to candidates, officeholders and positions not to find out which brands he endorses. The book isn't that expensive so for a big fan its a good purchase...but be warned, it's not really a ""case"" for loyalty...it's more like you scratch my back I'll scratch yours (advertisements)."
1,Desperation Redux,"You've heard his maniacal rant on late-night talk shows, Larry King, and the Sunday morning news panels for the last 7 years. Nothin' new with ""Stickin'""."
1,Is He Kidding?,"This book is a joke. Poorly written, disorganized, rambling, self-serving, yuk....I expected that the book would have something to say about the impeachment process and about what it was about President Clinton that made Carville stay loyal to him. Forget it - this is just one short, boring attempt by Carville to make money from his association with Clinton. No insights, no interesting scenes, plenty of boring details about Carville, then recipes, etc. Why would anyone buy this? Please don't. You'll only regret it."
3,sexy but average,"Physical therapist is surprised to find that her new live-in patient is the good-looking man she's had her eye on for months at the restaurant where she moonlights as a waitress. Although injured narcotics-cop Hero is pleased about having heroine around daily, he's having trouble masking his injury from her & his reasons for it. As their attraction quickly moves into an agreed-upon short-term affair, their feelings for each other get stronger but so does the danger following Hero & heroine.This was a light & sexy romance. Good sexual chemistry & some hot sex scenes. The action-suspense part was peripheral & predictable. Dialogue & characterization were ok. Both main characters were likeable & had some past issues that hampered their trust in love for each other. They had a smooth & quick resolution, after villain got caught. Nothing surprising or angtsy about it. Pretty formulaic.Moderately recommended."
2,I couldn't get through it,I'm a big fan of Carly phillips but I could not get through this book. I kept trying to finish it but it became too much work and not enough entertainment. If you're going to read a Carly Phillips book I wouldn't suggest this one. Her other books are fantastic though.
5,Booda Big Daddy Floppy Disc,"The Booda Big Daddy Floppy Disc is the best for a large dog that loves to play frisbee. It is durable, easy to control and through, and it is soft sided and flexible so that it does not irritate the dogs mouth. This is the second one I have had, the first one lasted two years and was used several times a day. I've tried every flying disc on the market (that I could find) and this is by far the favorite for my German Shepherd Maggie May and I,(The 12 inch one is the best, because it handles and flys where it is directed). I had a hard time finding another one. Thank You Amazon for making Maggie May's Christmas so special!"
1,Cheapo quality with dangers,"I used to have the original version of this disc (Booda?), which we loved, but bought this because it seemed the same from the literature and was less expensive. There's a reason for that lower price! The cheapness of the material was instantly palpable, and upon the first throw, within just a few minutes of one of my dogs doing the death-headshake on his way back to me, the plastic laminate on the back was peeling off all around. Next thing I know, both my dogs, being dogs, are eating the frayed pieces of laminate. So they've just ingested a significant amount of plastic, oh yay. So a Total Nix on this product. Buy the original and be happy."
5,FRANK,"MY DOG LOVES IT, HE HAS BECOME QUITE GOOD AT CATCHING THE FLOPPY DISC. HE HAS MANY TOYS BUT ALWAYS CARRIES OUT THE TAIL SPIN FLYER"
2,Imatation,"The discs that I received were not the floppy discs that I had originally ordered, but an imatation of the original. Within a couple of days of use, the ink began to dissolve and fade. The back of the disc began to she'd a thin material that was glued. Also, the material was a lesser grade quality, reducing the wt. of the disc. To say the least, I was very disappointed."
4,"Big Floppy Disc, Small Floppy Dog","My dog loves this toy, i will throw and she will chase it and bring it back like the good dog she is. The ONLY problem is that she is a quite small (only about a foot off the ground) and sometimes has to hold the disc and tilt her head to the side to make sure she doesn't trip over it when running back (which she does sometimes, and it is quite cute to see). I would recommend this product to any active dog owner, but smaller dogs might want a smaller toy to go fetch."
5,Fantastic Frisbee!!!,"This is my dog's FAVORITE toy! She would play it for hours if I would keep throwing it to her. I like it because it is soft and doesn't hurt or harm their teeth. It is soft and flexible and fly s beautifully.Have fun with this one!Floppy Disc 7-Inch Melon Style Soft BiteDisc Toy for Dogs, Small"
4,My Dog Loves It,I have a mini aussie and a small backyard. We love to play frisbee and she has used both the hard disks and the floppy discs and I can say that she catches more with the soft floppy than the hard. Also she enjoys it as it seems to stay in the air slighlty longer than a plastic disk. Best of all in a small yard there is less chance of me throwing the frisbee over the fence as these discs do not travel as far as the plastic discs. The only reason for 4 stars is because my dog gets a good grip on the disc she tries to play keep away and the it will rip if you try and pull it from her. We have gone through 5 discs in the last few years.
5,Indestructible,"My two golden retrievers love this disc. They play tug of war with it and it doesn't even get bent out of shape. Although there are multiple holes in it, the outer ring is still intact and it flys. Recently when I was going to buy a new one I noticed several people recommend the Flippy Flopper so I took their word for it and tried one. FORGET IT!!!! Within two days the disc was out of shape and wouldn't fly and within 4 days my dogs had chewed apart the outer braided ring. It went in the trash. What a waste of money. Stick with the Floppy Disc, it's indestructible."
2,"Not durable, destroyed 1 week","Will update on durability after time passes. Dog didn't show much interest in it until I gave her treats when she fetched it. Now without treats its still her favorite. I like it because I don't have to dig in snow to find it. 65 lb pit does paw, bite, and pull on it, even though I stop her ASAP. No damage yet, but we ve only used a couple times. If it lasts a few months a great toy!Update: Well third time did it in. She got a tooth through the fabric and then it was easily torn in half. Oh we'll, will try another brand."
3,Not what I ordered...,"What I ordered is what you see in the images for this product, namely a ""Soft Bite Floppy Disc"", manufactured by Booda. What I received was Booda's ""Original Tail-Spin Flyer."" They appear similar, but are not quite the same. While I would award the ""Soft Bite Floppy Disc"" a solid five stars, I have to deduct two stars for false advertising by Amazon. Perhaps I (and my border collie) will grow to love the ""Original Tail-Spin Flyer"", as we have the two ""Soft Bite Floppy Disc"" we have purchased in the past (including one I just bought last month from a local store). But I don't like being misled."
2,Torn up 1st day out of the box,"Previous reviews misleading about durability of this disc. My 1 year old German Shepherd tore the fabric on the edge of the disc within 10 minutes of play, exposing rubber ring. The floppy disk is a great concept in that it is much less abrasive on the dog's teeth than traditional disc. However, durability appears to have been sacrificed in the process."
5,Worth the price,"This toy holds up well. My dog and I like the way the larger size flies. Don't save a few bucks on the smaller ones - not as much fun. Other dogs often get hold of it and chew on it at the dog park, or start playing tug-of-war with my dog. These things are pretty tough. I'd guess I get about 6 months of use from one, which is used and abused 4-5 times a week."
5,My Aussie loves it!,"My mini Aussie had a very small disc to begin with, he out grew that one so this was his next and favorite He loves it. Easy for him to catch, easy on his mouth."
5,"(2) puppies - shelties, (too) much energy - perfect toy!!","Buy it. I used a clicker to get our litter-mate shelie puppies (2x8 months) to fetch. They picked it up at about 4 months. This toy is perfect. I bought it at 7 months once they had fetch with balls. Simply perfect. I alternate between this toy and ""Chuck-it"" hard rubber balls to play with them. Let me put it this way. Before I bought this and the Chuck It ball, they would great me at the door with tail wags and dances after work. Now, when I come home after work, they bark once or twice and do not come to me, but instead go to the back door to go outside and play fetch. ""Fetch"" or ""where is it?"" creates havoc in our house thanks to this toy. Oh - and these dogs eat everything!!!! yet this tough, but pliable canvas construction gives enough when they chew that it has not torn. 5 stars because I can't go higher."
5,His new favorite chew toy,"I can barely get the opportunity to throw this as he loves taking it and trying to tear it to shreds. Fortunately, this is a tough toy, and it's withstood the test of puppy teeth!"
2,Blah!,"This CD is terrible! This music makes me cringe! Okay I'll admit it isn't as bad as the string quartet or gothic acoustic but, how could somebody like this crappy tribute. The good tribute is the piano tribute. I mean Evanescence is NOT pop or electronic or dance or whatever. They're a unique rock band! I know they sort of go a little electro sometimes but, it's still rock! It may not be very heavy. But, the best thing is that Amy has strong vocals like Epica, Within Temptation, Lacuna Coil, or even Kamelot. (But, when I say Kamelot I mean they both have good vocals, not the same gender!) And Amy's vocals aren't too opera like Nightwish. (You'll see what I mean if you listen to Nightwish's song ""Dark Chest of Wonders"") But, DO NOT GET THIS CD!!! You want the PIANO tribute!"
1,Delicious chocolate. IF they weren't damaged/crushed,"if you like your carmello bar to be messy and leaky with the outer chocolate shell broken, squished, or just damaged beyond recognition, then this is the product for you. i have gone through 15 bars so far. and 10 of them are damaged with 6-7 so messy you'll have to use a spoon or else it's uneatable. i thought i did the smart thing and brought a box of them online instead of spending a buck 20 cents everyday at the 7 eleven. but this turned out to be a poor investment. now i already send the seller a letter of complaint. let's see what they have to say...."
4,got here fast!,"It got here really fast,and was in pretty good shape. It was a little old,but mostly taken care of."
1,Not a Titanic Story,"I have already written one review of this book which Amazon would not print but gave me no reason as to why. This book is not about the Titanic and re-incarnation. It's in large print, 67 pages to actually make it the size of a pamphlet. It is about a man that was on the Titanic. It claims lifeboats were lost due to the suction of the sinking, this never happened. It claims a boy was reincarnated because he could find where the rice was kept in a house. Don't waste your money. I have actually been told on-line stores won't carry it because it's description is so misleading."
4,Fits Xbox 360 HD/AV Connection Well,"The first thing I noticed when I inserted a regular optical cable into the Xbox 360 HD/AV pack is that it didn't seem to fit quite right - it didn't ""snap"" into place. I needed to buy another optical cable anyway so I gave this one a try since it says it's for the 360, specifically. It does fit securely into the Xbox connection, unlike the first one I bought, which I actually paid $20 for at a big box retailer.Quality seemed fine, though as the other reviewer said it is short at only 3 feet long.But for the money, it's probably the best you're going to get."
2,Where did it say this was only 3' long?,"I guess I missed the fine print. I'm didn't need it much longer, but most Xbox cables that I've purchased have always been 6' or longer.Now I've got to order another cable."
5,A must-read for those on the ascension path,"I did not find this book. It found me 2 years ago. Eversince then my book had been circulating among my friends. All found this book hard to put down, and even though they had read it, they subsequently ordered and waited patiently (6-8 weeks) for their own copy. One friend commented that she could feel so much energy/love coming out of the pages. We had tried what Dan Dupuis had taught, and the results are truly amazing."
2,Not What They Used To Be,"I've used the Gripper Strap product for nearly a decade as a full-time photojournalist. A strap typically lasts me 2-3 years before it frays, smells or the rubber stitches crumble off (or some combination of the three).Sadly, the rubber pattern doesn't match what's shown in the picture, nor what's on my old strap. Now it's only two thin lines at the outward edge of the strap. Not very grippy at all.I'd return the product, but it's just not worth the hassle at $16 each. I'll use them until I find a more suitable alternative product."
5,Simple and perfect,"As much as I like my camera maker, I didn't want the brightly-colored advertisement-band that came with my dSLR. This is the perfect replacement -- fits nicely, not too bulky, and doesn't stand out.I've got a medium-small dSLR (Pentax K-7) which I use with Pentax's awesome Limited prime lenses, and anything bigger than this strap would be overkill. If you routinely use a bigger dSLR with grip and a 70-200mm f/2.8 zoom, you may want something heftier.I don't think the version with swivels is necessary. The strap is so simple and lightweight that getting tangled isn't a big problem."
3,"""From Dance To Love""","Released in 1979, on United Artists, after Sang had some legal problems with her former label Private Stock. This was a commercial flop. Side One consists of five dated (even by 1979 standards) bubblegum disco tunes. The single being a 12"" release of ""From Dance To Love"". Side Two contains five tunes in the adult contemporary vein, which is very listenable. ""Moments"" stands out as a tune where Sang showcases her powerful pipes. She tried to recreate the magic of The Bee Gees' ""Emotion"" with ""I Can Still Remember"" featuring The Alessi Brothers, but it falls short. After this, Sang disappeared from sight."
2,They look really chaep.,"Personally didn't like how the stalk wasn't centered in the earring with the stud, instead it's placed below the stud. Makes the earrings LOOK CHEAP. They look a lot better in the pictures."
5,Great product,I looked at about 20 different records and I was nervous about ordering this because of a couple of the reviews. It was awesome great sound and great price. I would highly recommend get this one.
1,yamaha alto recorder,"I had an old dolmetsch recorder, which I misplaced, so I ordered the yamaha. It sounded tinny and difficult to play compared with the dolmetsch, which fortunately, I found."
1,Avoid this horribly cropped DVD,"As much as I love Richard Lester's delightful telling of ""The Three Musketeers,"" I have to warn all who care about a decent image to avoid this DVD like the plague. At first glance, it appears to be nicely letterboxed, but after a while you might notice a lot of foreheads and feet getting cut off at the top and bottom of frame. This is due to the absurd placement of ""letterbox"" bars over the top and bottom of a standard tv-ratio ""Pan and Scan"" image. So not only are you losing the sides of the image as you always do with widescreen films reformatted to TV, you lose the top and bottom as well! That seemed impossibly incompetent to me, so I compared the same frame from a Pan&Scan VHS and from the DVD, and my fears were confirmed. If that wasn't shoddy enough, there's an annoying one-pixel jag in the superfluous top bar. This movie is terrific, but this DVD realease is the worst I've seen yet. Avoid at all costs."
2,I thought they over-did it with the fight scenes...,"I mean, I can only take SO MUCH sword-fighting before it starts getting repetitive, and these films (I'm including ""The Four Musketeers"") REALLY over-did it!When they made both movies there was a scandal of sorts, as the producers NEVER said they were making a MOVIE (singular), instead calling it ""the PROJECT"". So, when they later released TWO films (""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers""), several cast members sued, only to be shown that they'd been paid for their PROJECT, not a MOVIE.The casting was good, and stretching this LONG book into two movies was probably a good idea --- not that they stuck very closely to the book. Still, it's probably the best telling of that story on film, assuming you can put up with the endless sword-fighting. I couldn't. It just got stupid!"
1,I did not receive the product or a refund,"I did not receive the product or receive a refund on my credit card. Although I emailed the company twice. They email me back. Amazon should investigate the purchase and not allow the company to do business. I have purchased many items, and this is the first problem I have had."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,I thought the book was overwritten and boring at times. Most of the book is drawn-out fluff. Then the episode guide has one sentence describing each show. I learned more about this great show watching their E! True Hollywood Story than reading this.
3,"Interesting, though redundant","This book contains a lot of little known facts about ""Three's Company"" (did you know there were 3 pilots?), but unfortunately the author fills a lot of space with repeated material. For example, he will quote one of the show's producers on a specific subject, then go into detail on it, and then quote one of the show's stars about the same thing and basically reiterate what he had just written.The insight into the show's stars and writers is...well, insightful. Everyone seems to hold John Ritter in very high regard (though Joyce DeWitt does have some bickering points), and I felt a bit more of an appreciation for the entire cast.Overall, a good, entertaining read, despite some redundancy."
1,Only the presence of Priscilla Barnes may have helped,"John Ritter was an insensitive fool, Joyce DeWitt is still emotionally scarred from the years of abuse and sexual discrimiation suffered at the hands of the NRW producing team, Don Knotts is old and Jenille Harrison was the fall guy for Suzanne Somers who only wanted equal pay for her work.The author seems like a freak and the cast are all disappointments. Priscilla Barnes aka Nurse Terri, was the only thing that made the show watchable and she had the good sense to not participate in the book. Look for her in captavating supporting roles in films like ""The Crossing Guard"" and ""Mallrats"". At least Three's Company didn't overtake the lives and talents of everyone associated with it.Watch ther reruns. Skip the Book. Don't ask questions."
5,Fantasmic! Everything you wanted to know plus more.,"This is great reading for anyone that loved the show or just loved the controversies surrounding the show. You will be amazed how your company will pick up the book and not want to put it down. Above all else, this book will rekindle the spirited debates between friends about who was the best, Chrissy or Terry, the Ropers or Mr. Furly? .....Norman"
5,GREAT BOOK FOR NOVICE OR PRO!,"This book details the construction of the very unusual Atkinson ""Cycle"" Engine. It is easy to read and follow. There are many pictures and drawings to help explain the construction from start to finish. I am a novice at machining, but even I was able to build this engine and make it run. The basic construction calls for castings that you make yourself, but if you're not up to casting, you could easily make the parts from solid stock material. When complete, I couldn't get my engine to run right away due to a mistake I made. I emailed the author and he personally outlined a procedure for me to follow - I did, discovered the problem, and now my engine runs fine! It gives a great sense of accomplishment, and I heartily recommend it to anyone who likes to tinker in their shop!"
4,Another Gingery Gem!,"The instructions and drawings are simple and to the point (typical Gingery). You have to follow them closely, but then, any machine-shop project needs your full attention. If you are not capable of doing your own castings (i.e. your upstair neighbors or landlord would REALLY dislike a roaring foundry furnace in the middle your living room...) you can make the patterns, and find a foundry to cast them for you. Castings are suprisingly inexpensive, so get a couple of extra sets made and sell them on [website] to help pay for your machine shop habit!..."
5,Perfect for On-The-Go Studio,This was perfect for my on the go studio.In this bag I have:4 = Lightstands1 = Crossbar for hanging backdrop off 2 lightstands4 = Umbrellas4 = SpeedlightsStill with room to spare. :)
5,great bag,"I bought this bag after reading a review and the basis all that and more. Very heavy duty and well made, I think it will hold up good against the rigors of the road."
5,Carry Bag for Speaker Stands or Microphone Stands,"These bags are great, they're made of very durable material. I used to have to make multiple trips because I can only carry few of the microphone and the speaker stands at a time. And when you try to put them onto a cart, sometimes they will roll off while you are pushing the cart. These bags allow me to consolidate everything into three bags and they even stay on while you're pushing the cart. And the best thing is you only have to make one trip :=)"
5,Great Product,"I bought this bag intending to use it for photography gear. Light stands, umbrellas, collapsable softboxs, brackets, etc. I love it. I want another. Its only 20.00!!!! In photography equiptment, thats dirt cheap!!! This thing has great durability and is extremely spacious. I fit 2 3ft light stands, 2 big umbrellas, 2 24"" collapsable softboxes, all the mounting gear, and my bogan tripod w/ the pistol grip head. All this fits comfortably... The bag is padded and easy to carry. For the money? This is a steal. Buy it!"
5,Carries my photo stands with ease.,Bags with lesser quality costs triple the price only because of their nametags. All photographic suppliers gauge their customers any way they can.In Bag:Avenger C-StandAvenger bar3 Softbox kits
5,Exactly as advertised.,"Big, seems to be pretty rugged, and retain's shape pretty well when empty. Sturdy handles and fits great over my shoulder with the shoulder strap. Great value for it's price."
5,Very good build quality!!!,"Like others said, it can hold three mic stand or two speaker stands easily, maye more. Seems very durable. So far so good1"
3,nice SPACE,the sewing is bad so that I need to repair many place by myself with needle. other than that it is good.
2,UPdate! This bag is fragile. Self destructs. Mfr is replacing...,"Update. The manufacturer is replacing the bag.Initially: The quality construction and the fit seemed excellent. Good design of handles. Easy to carry. Some built in padding makes for a bag that won't let the contents mar adjacent surfaces when banging around in transit and will protect the stands from cosmetic injury.BUT: It is coming apart at the seams!Now, the seams are ripping after only two gigs. It looked like a good product."
2,UGH,"For the record, I am an objective reviewer. I love ""both"" of the Black Sabbath line-ups (yes, I said ""both, because the other ones aren't worth mentioning....Ian Gillan? pleeeeeaase.)Unfortunately, what really sucks about this ""live"" set, is the overall flat sound quality. The performance is enjoyable enough. Dio is definitely better on his own material, but holds his own on the Ozzy stuff. Its just that the whole thing sounds muffled. The crowd - who are usually the focus of a live set - are mixed down to the audio equivalent of a vacuum cleaner running in the next room. The energy is completely sucked out of this performance.I'd have to say this is one of the worst live sets ever. It gets two stars because the set list is solid and the band is actually in good form - except the rim-shot king Vinnie Appice...one of the worst drummers of all time. Bill Ward would have jacked it up to 3 stars......In short, don't bother with this one...."
1,Ridiculous!,"Uau! Some people are giving 5-star to this one...! Unbeliavable! The mixing of this one was made when Dio and Sabbath were in permanent fight with one another. DIo singing ""War Pigs"" and ""Iron Man"" is sad... The band's performance is amazingly without any inspiration. THe albun sounds like a bootleg of concerts put together in any direction. I say it: it is a completely forgetabble release by Sabbath. Period!"
1,No Way!,"Man, it's douche chilling to hear Dio do Ozzy's classic songs (God he butchers them!) Don't get me wrong I love Dio but stick to your own songs man! I would have givin' this album a 4 or even 5 star rating if he would have done his own stuff but every time I hear him do an Ozzy song I cringe, it totally ruins the entire CD!"
2,"STOP, YOU GUYS, I CAN'T BREATHE.......",".... I'm laughing too hard.I guess I'm very picky when it comees to live albums anyway.I like DIO, I really do, but he never sounded more like a fruit than he does trying to cover OZZY songs.Those flambouyant wails just don't belong in songs like N.I.B or BLACK SABBATH.I'd stick to the studio material if I was you."
1,Pure Blasphemy,"It's bad enough that Dio made mediocre music with the members of the once mighty Sabbath,but please, he just murders their classic material.One of the most worthless live albums ever made, Save your allowance. Get Live At Last instead, the sound may not be quite as good but at least it's true vintage Sabbath."
1,TRAGEDY ...,"I don't really believe the people who said this is great Sabbath album. Without falling in the old struggle Ozzy x Dio, the simple fact is that this CD is horrible. Why ? Bad song selection, unbeliavable bad production ( Vinnie Appice's drums are almost gone,the crowd seems to have been added in studio ), it's a record destined to fail since the start, due to the band internal struggles. Dio's Sabbath was the last hope Iommi had to mantain the band strong and with its charisma untouched. ""LIVE EVIL"" (released after Dio and Appice already had left )marked the beginning of the tragical era of infinite line-ups in "" IOMMI SABBATH "". Forget this album. It is nothing."
3,"Good, but it doesn't sound the same without Ozzy.","Ronnie James Dio is a great vocalist and I'm not putting anything passed him... but without Ozzy, songs like NIB, Paranoid, and especially Black Sabbath just don't sound the same. It's still worth getting but if you really want a good live Sabbath album, get Reunion."
5,Dio w/ sabbath,The Dio era with Sabbath was a rebirth for the band after the departure of Ozzy. The material from Heaven and Hell and the Mob Rules stand out here (IMO) over the older Sabbath tunes. R.I.P. RJD. You are greatly missed !
2,not totally live,"The conflict between Dio and Iommi came to a head.Each of them went into the studio to try to make their parts more dominant than the other's.Result: one of the most boring ""live"" albums you'll ever sit through."
2,Better buy Reunion!,"There is only one but big reason not to buy this album: More noise than music. I can't hear anything but the guitar and the voice. Better buy a studio album or Reunion. Black sabbath rules, but buy something else!"
2,"Try Ozzy's ""Speak of the Devil"" instead","Iommi, Geezer, and Dio don't seem very enthused on this live set. Ronnie tries to get the crowd going a couple of times but they are so far back in the mix that they have almost no effect on this record, and that's the essence of live records. I was shocked to see Dio's name on the song writing credits of ""Paranoid."" What, did he change a phrase or add the word ""rainbow"" to the song or something? What a crock! No wonder Ronnie was soon gone due to clashing egos. Try Ozzy's (also 1982, all Black Sab songs) live release of ""Speak of the Devil"" instead. The Oz never fails to get his crowds into a frenzy, and his then-guitarist Brad Gillis and drummer Tommy Aldridge are in peak form thoughout. I would love to have a huge poster featuring the cover art of ""Live Evil,"" that is awesome!"
2,"I like Sabbath, I like Ozzy and I like Dio -- I don't like Dio doing Ozzy","Dio's renditions of the classic Ozzy-era Sabbath Songs sounds wrong. His arching vocal style, which sounds fine on Mob Rules and Heaven and Hell just does not fit with hard rockin' tunes like Iron Man and Paranoid. Worse yet, on several songs he resorts to ""talking"" the lyrics like a bad Vegas act. I say skip it."
1,FORGET ABOUT IT!,"The biggest laugh of this one is how low and far away the audience seems ...not to mention DIO's attempt at singing OZZY. In fact, there probably wasn't even a live audience to begin with. From a producer's stand point, this is as weak as it gets for a live CD."
4,Pretty Good,"I recently purchased this CD because I'm a big Black Sabbath Fan and I like Dio.I thought the CD waz pretty OK.The crowd really didn't seem as ""into"" it as the crowd on other live CD's did. But,Dio's vocals were pretty good.And Iommi's guitar solos,though often-times long,were always very good.Most of the songs were good,though I was slightly dissapointed about this version of ""Heaven and Hell"".The version on Dio's most recent live CD is alot better.All in all,i give this CD a 4 out of 5 just because it IS Black Sabbath and it DOES suceed in doing alot of their greatest hits well and it DOES have a live version of Iron Man on it that doesn't have Ozzy cussing for 3 minutes straight before the song even starts"
4,Excellent...,"Even though the band had already split by the time this album was released and a lot of critics blasted the album afterwards,this is a high quality live Sabbath album,where the live versions of some of the 'heaven and Hell'and'Mob Rules'-era material simply burn,while Dio's renditions of old Sabbath tunes are extremely competent.Remember'If you listen to fools,the mob rules...'"
3,It Is Sufficient...,"...if you do not have high expectations, and do not require a Flash. As for me, I wish I had spent more and bought a unit with a flash... :o("
1,Does not even deserve 1 star,"Well i hold nothing against amazon.com because they are wonderful, but this camera was a waste of time. I recive it and its make of thin plastic which could easily break if dropped. Then when i switch on the product all seems well until i tried to take a picture, and nothing happend. I then tired to switch modes only to learn that it is frozen. I consulted the booklet, buy my camera decided to do its on thing rather then its inteded procedure. Well needless to say i returned it and we refuneded promptly."
4,The Clans Get a Little More Attention,"Although I may seem critical about this series now that Stackpole is no longer the front man of the books, this particuluar addition to the Battletech universe was a good one. If you're a big fan of the clans (as i am) then you'll love this one. Clan Wolf in Exile and the Jade Falcons have it out once again, and on worlds that changed the Clans forever. Twycross to name one. And we once again get to revisit the Falcon Guards as they fight to regain their tainted honor lost in the Inner Sphere invasion. Although not Stackpole, Pardoe is still a veteran of the series and has also written about the Clans before, so he has a good take on their culture. As for the book as how it relates to the overall plot, it pushes the Civil War to it's final chapter, End Game. If you're a long time reader, pick it up, because our grand adventure is almost over."
4,its was pretty good...,"if you know no java at all you should get this book because i got it to make online programs for my site... i just got threw with this book so i havent made any progs yet, but soon i will, the setup of this book was OK, but they should have add some humor, you'll get bored of reading thats whay i gave it 4 stars, im only thirteen and it tought me well, good book, get it"
2,Dry & obscure,Clarity is not the authors' forte. The book is sprinkled with gibberish like.. an initial value supplied by a constructor for an instance variable survives an initial value supplied in an instance-variable-definition statement.
1,On to confusion!,"The concept of this book was to build, chapter by chapter a functioning program and allow you to see how it eventually all comes together. Seems logical right...wrong. The concepts are poorly presented and difficult to grasp without a semi-good grasp of programming in general. Rather than small isolated programming examples, as this book builds upon previous examples you forget what previous code(that you studied say two months ago) does and you continually find yourself having to go back and reread the section that covered it. If you can find this book printed in a language you cannot speak or write in buy that version instead as it will make more sense."
5,One of the best books on Understanding basics of OOP,"I think at introductory level, it is the best book to understand basics of OOP and JAVA. It seems as if Author has written whole book in one sitting. There is such a flow in writing of sections of book that you are tempted to read more and more like a suspense novel."
4,An excellent introduction to JAVA,"P. Winston continues his superb ""On to..."" series with a book on JAVA. It's a straightforward introduction to the language and to the basics of OO programming. It is very well-suited both for beginners and people moving on from C/C++. The only (slight) disadvantage is a problem with the typesetting in a couple of chapters. The current edition covers the JDK 1.0, hopefully an upgrade to 1.1 will be published soon. It is recommended!!!!"
5,"Excellent, timely, lively, important","Berzon has done what all of us were praying someone somewhere would do: expose the World Trade Center redevelopment for the disgusting fraud that it is. Anyone who calls this ""nonsense"" hasn't read the book and probably wouldn't know how."
1,Nonsense,"Mr. Berzon continues to have sour grapes about the fact his plan was given little consideration into the rebuilding process. When some ""pro-twins"" rebuilders suggested that a vote should be taken to pick a single design to go against Pataki's plan, Berzon opposed it. He is taking his anger out on a plan that remains superior to his.Rather than being a book about corruption, it reads more like a childish editorial, filled with excuses about his own failed plan.His cries only try to incite anger rather than any form of unity."
2,Nothing really new,"I've been able to read a lot of Justin Berzon's information beforehand on his site. He does a good job in collecting information about how the rebuilding process wasn't all that fair. His goal isn't so bad either (rebuilding the twins). However, the fact remanins, that because of many factors, the twins are not going to be rebuilt. It's sad, but an unfortuante truth. The current plan has potential though. Berzon's book is a weak and losing effort. Wheter he knows it or not, his efforts won't end up in the twins being rebuilt, but rather Ground Zero remaining a hole. I for one, am ready for NYC to start building.I actually recommend looking into this for those who are interested in seeing how politics and competition have a big effect on not just the WTC, but any major development site. However, I wouldn't recommend it as a guide to the ultimate truth about the rebuilding process, since a lot of his work reads like an angry letter to an editor."
3,nothing new,"I've been able to read a lot of Justin Berzon's information beforehand on his site. He does a good job in collecting information about how the rebuilding process wasn't all that fair. His goal isn't so bad either (rebuilding the twins). However, the fact remanins, that because of many factors, the twins are not going to be rebuilt. It's sad, but an unfortuante truth.

2,So much potential....,"I love Scooby-Doo. This game had so much potential, and it is SUPER short! There were only 5 levels with very repetitive parts to it. I enjoyed finding the evidence and using different tools to find the clues, but disliked how easy it was to figure out who the culprit was. This game's graphics weren't that good either. I mean eventually you kinda ignore them, but when you first turn the game on you are like whoa this graphics are terrible. The music isn't bad and not annoying like many games that I have played, and the voices of the characters are very close to the real thing so that was a good! Overall I would not recommend this game to someone who really wants a long and twisted plot because you would be gravely disappointed. Again this game had a lot potential, and maybe one day they will make it better and a bit harder!"
3,Another ABBA Compilation?,"Yep, it's another compilation and not a very good one at that. The packaging is good, but the songs (most of them) are shorter versions (not edited, just faded a few seconds earlier than the original versions). The only plus is that the bad spot in Dancing Queen in this 24-bit remaster has been corrected and this time it's even harder to detect. Knowing Me, Knowing You has also been corrected in this remaster, but it sucks more than the previous 24-bit remasters. If you're a die-hard fan (like me) you'll buy this album no matter WHAT anyone says about it, but I would suggest The Definitive Collection above this one to those of you just looking for a good collection of ABBA songs, you get all the same songs but ALL the big hits worldwide!"
1,I can't believe I got hyped into buying this!,"The producers apparently recruited every member of their swingers' club to write glowing praise for this toxic waste. Most of it looks like Karen Black's acid trip from Easy Rider. Two-thirds of the tape gives us one bow-legged brunette kneeling in the sand or crawling through ferns and twigs in the forest. The rest is...ahh, forget it."
1,chinese water torture,... Has nothing to do with yoga. Ladys look drugged out sleeping. Try another nude yoga offering. Total junk.
1,Money-Making SCAM,"I am embarrassed to admit that I was one of those amateur photographers who entered the photo contest for the International Library of Photography. I received my impressive letter in the mail stating that I was a semi-finalist who would have my picture published in one of their books and I was admittedly proud. However, I wasn't interested in spending the $70 to see my photo in print. When I went on-line to see what other photos were semi-finalists, I realized that EVERY SINGLE PHOTO that is submitted is published in one of their books. The whole thing was a scam to get me to buy one of their ridiculously priced photography books. Don't be a sucker!!!"
2,eh?,"its cool to see amature photography,but the first reveiw is right they make the book a bajillion pages long and put almost all of them in it,dont get me wrong its good to see how intresting some of the photographs are,but i advise only buying it if you are just a picture fanatic,otherwise no until its like 19$ its way too much for this book i dont own it but i did get a chance to look through it from a friend who does,so yeah the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because i know that even the least attractive pictures in it some person did work on :("
3,"Great nightlight BUT,","The description contains an error, it is a 3 LED light NOT a 5 LED unit. Even with 3 LEDs it is very bright and casts only a very slight bluish tint unlike a different brand LED nightlight I own that emits a terrible dark blue light. The light sensor feature works excellent and is a nice feature.*UPDATE* After about one year of use it started to cast a very bluish light."
2,Really Bright,"While this light certainly lights up a room, it's really too bright to be a night light. The quality of the light is harsh (think street light), and it's blinding to see in the middle of the night. We tried it in a variety of locations in the house and weren't happy with it anywhere. I think it's headed for the garage."
3,Not the best,"We tried numerous LED nightlights and finally settled on the ones that remain on during a power outage and recharge themselves. This one isn't bad, but it isn't the best product."
5,Does what it promises,"A simple product.Low energy usage (using LEDs).Low energy usage (goes off during the day).Adjustable - make it shine into the room, along the wall, or against the wall (for indirect light).Good product."
1,Crappy product,I purchased this night light expecting it to last for at least a year. It started having problems coming on after about 3 weeks and quite working completely after only 5 weeks. I would not recommend this Feit NL5/LED night light.
1,Useless!,I bought this about 10 months ago and last month it started flickering. It's now a useless piece of junk!
1,after two months it is useless,I bought one and I liked it - fairly bright and it twists a variety of ways so that you can light whatever path you want. So I ordered three more for the entire hallway in my basement.About two months later they got dimmer - as expected. But I didn't know they would get so dim that they are now useless.One of the four I bought also stopped working completely.
2,fades over time,"Starts out fairly bright but within a few months it dims to almost unseeable. Wouldn't buy again for the money, regards of the savings!"
2,Brightness loss is severe,"I bought three of these. For two, the brightness after several weeks is at best 30-40% of when these were originally plugged in.This deceptive nature of the product is hugely disappointing."
2,Never shuts off,This unit is brand new - right out of the package and it won't shut off even if I shine a very bright light directly at the sensor. This is the first and last time I purchase a Feit product. Why wasn't this product quality tested before it left the factory?
5,must see,"This is a must see. I cried and cried. These poor women are suffering. These doctors are angels, very well done"
5,Feeling better each day!,"I felt that ""Beating the Senior Blues"" was written especially for me! As a widow, I did not realize how sad, depressed, lonely and inactive I had become. This book gave me instant hope and is a splendid guide to become alive and well again. Each section helps you, whether by exercise, regaining friendships, having new activities and circle of friends - I am indebted to the authors for helping me! I recommend giving this book to anyone you know who needs a boost to ""feel better and enjoy life again""."
1,All That Glitters Is Not Gold,"Somewhere is the cogent idea to this 1990 follow-up to the classic Purple Rain. Unfortunately, it cannot be found in this weak script that is loosely taped together with numerous music videos.Prince reprises his Purple Rain character, The Kid, who is now a performer and co-owner of a club, the Glam Slam, with his former rival (Morris Day). Business turns sour when The Kid is ""asked"" by his partner to pay shakedown money to the mayor. So, in a quest for truth, justice and full ownership of the club, The Kid challenges his business partner to a music battle.The plans for the movie started in 1987, but delays - primarily due to casting problems - kept delaying its production. Prince was king with Warner Bros. due to his incredible marketing power of cross-promotion within many categories of pop culture. But the movie was a box office bridge to nowhere and showed that all that glitters is not necessarily golden when created by this incredible artist."
1,Crapfiti Bridge,"I love my Prince! I am the biggest Prince fan that I know. He gives excellent concert. I loved Purple Rain and Under the Cherry Moon but this movie, no way! I think that this must have been one those you need to make 3 movie obligations and Prince did like Marvin Gaye, just put something out to fulfill that obligation. I do like the songs but dang, this was just a bad movie."
3,Big Prince fan,"I have this video. I never watch it all, I justfast-forward to the songs.The songs are really good, but the plot of this movie is not. It had the potential to be a good movie, but it looked like it was filmed in someone's backyard. It reminds me of a high-school musical. If you are a Prince fan you should see it. Prince was quoted as saying that this film is misunderstood. Maybe so , but I would rather listen to the c.d."
1,One Of The Worst Movies I Have Ever Seen,"I was a huge Prince fan when this movie came out and I remember how excited I was about it! So I took my girlfriend to it and was embarrassed for Prince and myself for dragging my girlfriend there. It was painfully unfunny, convoluted, poorly directed with terrible sets...ugh it's a terrible mess and doesn't deserve to be preserved."
1,An unwatchable mess --- make no mistake about it,"All the bad reviews of this film are true and then some. I'm a huge Prince fan and even I cannot defend a movie which makes UNDER THE CHERRY MOON look like THE GODFATHER. The attempts at humor are direct rip-offs from PURPLE RAIN (treating women like crap, Morris and Jerome having confrontations# and are executed so amateurishly that there is nothing but dead silence from the audience. Everytime a character does something which Prince disapproves, there are cuts to surrounding characters rolling their eyes and shaking their heads. The movie tries to evoke emotion cheaply without earning it, especially when the Ingrid Chavez character dies #oops, should have put a spoilder there) and Prince and Morris make the peace. The problem is, there is no one to blame for this film but Prince: he directed, performed, wrote and starred in it. It's very much his creation and it is a disaster."
3,Reflection,I like this movie more and more every time I watch it. By the end of the movie I'm always reflecting on my faith and how strong it really is and where the weaknesses are. I truly believe that control of our lives are with a higher power.
3,Spiritual & Sexy...,"Prince's semi-sequel to the mega-hit Purple Rain this time has ""The Kid"" battling for ownership rights to the Glam Slam nightclub & the love of the mysterious angel from just around the corner...Highlighted by several musical performances by Prince & The Time, Grafitti Bridge also features Mavis Staples, George Clinton & Tevin Campbell."
3,Flawed but misunderstood,"Speaking as a Prince fan, he took himself too seriously with this one. 1990's ""Graffiti Bridge"" was slammed when it was released and it all falls on Prince. When promoting the film, he should've never presented it as a drama. ""Graffiti Bridge"" is a musical and that's it. It may not have a big setting like ""Moulin Rouge"" but it is similar to a 60's beach musical. The point of it is to enjoy the music, and on that part ""Graffiti Bridge"" delivers. It played like one long music video and that's the point. Prince knows that but he wanted to be a serious director and actor, something he is not. ""Graffiti Bridge"" is for an acquired taste, you either love it or hate it."
1,No No No!!!!,"No no no!!.............Absolutely dreadful drivel. The acting is atrocious, without exception. The sentimentality is nauseating.....who told Ms Chavez she can write????...........she can't!!.....and she cetainly can't act or sing either. Prince is his usual, affected, camp self.....and who on earth told him he can act......????.......will these star struck fools never learn??.Their egos must be huge to think we'd fall for such dreadful rubbish.........."
3,Lay down your funky weapons ...,"GRAFFITI BRIDGE was originally conceived as a movie for Kim Basinger and Prince, but they broke up before it went into production. Then Prince thought he would make a movie centered on THE TIME, but Warner Brothers demanded that it be a sequel to PURPLE RAIN. They filmed it all on sets to avoid the Minnesota weather, and also because Prince wanted to create a true 1950s musical feeling. It's about the Kid and Morris squaring off against each other on how a club they share ownership should be run. A mysterious woman enters both their lives (Aura - Ingrid Chavez), and she becomes the catalyst for them to both change in spiritual ways.The DVD is fine - almost a direct port of the laserdisc print. It's a little grainy at times, and sometimes the soundtrack seems off ... but overall you get a nice package with the movie and the music videos. Watch GRAFFITI BRIDGE for the music scenes first and foremost -- that's where all the passion is."
1,YAWWWWWWWWWWN,I couldnt believe when this film came out i actually sit in a theatre to see this talking about torture.. To this day i dont get the story line and the spirtual thing.. Did some one say his worst film all his films are not good but the only thing that save them was the music and the music in this one is just average not his best piece of work Avoid this one at all costs
1,BURN THAT BRIDGE!,"Welllll here we go again...you know..I suffered through the viewing and loss of two hours of my life with Under the Cherry Moon, and then I saw this..Some actors can sing, and some singers can act..but I didnt see that singer in this film. I think whoever directed this movie was drunk, and they should have fired every single person in this film, starting with the ""purple one"". You know..atleast in Under the Cherry Moon, you got a bonus, a poorly acted death scene where Prince throws himself on the ground..no such luck in this movie! I tried to donate this movie to a charity that feeds the homeless, but they said the homeless wasnt ""that"" hungry..so I ended up using it for something to put my coffee cup on in the morning..dvds make great coasters especially the ones that suck."
2,Another way of thinking,"I have the laserdisc of this movie. The storyline has quite a few problems, the acting also lacks direction. Years ago, before the premier of this movie, my pal, Andre, asked if I thought it was going to be any good. I replied ""Who cares, its a vehicle for another Prince album."" Forget the storyline on this one folks, enjoy the music! Besides New Power Generation and Thieves in the Temple there's great music by The Time, Tevin Campbell, Mavis Staples and George ""funkadelic"" Clinton."
2,close to useless,"So far this book has decided to make its own notation for things rather than use what everybody else uses. My professor is constantly having to tell us the difference between ""The books version"" and ""The real version"" I thought it was maybe just my professor that was different but I have an older linear algebra book that agrees with my professor. So I think its just the book that's different. I cant even use it to study for the test because everything is written different than what my professor wants. Its really annoying."
4,Santa Clara University's linear algebra text,This review is of the 2nd edition printed in '89. I bought this book off the shelf at SCU as a review source. The texts chosen at SCU have a tendency to lean toward the practical applications side and away from the theoretical. Johnson's text was no exception. Practical aspects of limitations of solution methods implimented on computers are discussed. A bit dry or lacking in motivation but otherwise a good coverage of the subject matter with answers to odd numbered problems at the back. My only real criticism of the text was the authors' tendency to introduce some important concepts in the problem sets themselves rather than covering them in the main body of the chapter. This is awkward if you want to use the book as a reference.
5,It's a good book.,"Good and nice. Even though its a second-handed book, it looks like a new one. I like it very much!"
3,Required for class,"Not the best textbook, but not the worst either. It's a thinner book, so it fits well in my backpack."
1,Poorly explained. Use other textbook,"I use this book as my Univ textbook, but this one is too bad to learn from.1. lack of example. example for only super-easy&basic; problems.2. Too expensive for it quality3. NEVER buy its student solution manual(the solution manual contains odd number's answers, but no explanation. It's the same as the answers in the end of the book.)"
5,Another moving read from Cheryl Reavis,"Once again, Cheryl Reavis provides a well-written, shrewd and moving story of overcoming the stuff that happens. Calvin ""Bugs"" Doyle is recovering from a near-fatal helicopter crash when he becomes involved in Katherine Meehan's life. Friendship leads to attraction; attraction becomes love, even if Meehan thinks she's too old for him.Outfacing Meehan's sisters and Meehan's doubts with the aid of his landlady, Mrs. Bee, Cal sets out to win the woman he wants with the same determination he's used to succeed as a paratrooper and to survive the accident that nearly killed him.Cheryl Reavis is a wonderful writer: smart about people, with an easygoing, nearly conversational style that draws the reader in. I highly, highly recommend this book."
2,A little bit of everything,"This book is definitely over-rated by others (my opinion). However, I would agree with a couple of reader's comments that some of the pictures are good, but the discussion on the topics of bonsai are too general (and kind of shallow indeed). If anyone would like to know about or even start a bonsai, I would recommend a better substitute: Bonsai (101 Essential Tips) that costs less than $5.00."
1,Don't get this one...go for the Toshiba instead,"I work for the local school distticts IS department, we recently bought 286 of these and they have been nothing but a problem since day one. The monitor latch often breaks, the wireless does not work worth crap, and the screen is very dark and hard to read. Altough the Toshiba cost's only a few hundred dollars more, it is WELL worth the extra money. Don't waste it on the Acer."
2,"Thorough, but mediocre exercises","Both Basic and Advanced are essentially classroom textbooks, with textbook-style exercises that are abstract and do not follow any one project. Personally, I prefer ""learning by example"" when the tutorials and exercises are part of a larger project - it's more important to learn how to employ the concepts and tools in a realistic project setting, as opposed to a bunch of unrelated topic-specific exercises.Also, the included CDROMs border on useless. There are only a few dozen sample drawings per volume and not much else. The exercises consist of ""open drawingx.dwg from the CD and perform one or two operations on it."" Surely, with 650MB of available space, more could have been included than a few megabytes of drawing files.These books do get good marks for thoroughly covering all the topics. The lack of real-world application severely limits these books' usefulness for self-learners."
2,little scout info,"If your looking for Pickup info this book would be ok, but to say Scout in the title is misleading. of the 130 pages, only 15 were scout & scout II related. NOT counting reproduced adds (blurry) there were only 3 photos of a Scout (I). All were front end shots and were not of any help. To be fair, the text contains interesting information, and a few more photos of scout II. Even those photos do little to support the text. Many times special packages are mentioned, but no info is given about these, other that upgraded seats or specal paint. Gosh a photo here would be helpful! detail in the pickup section much more thought out, scout seemed to be add on/marketing last minute thing. sorry"
3,not bad,"I enjoyed this book but I feel that the writting could have been a little better. However, the book does cover all the main detials of WW1"
4,Very Serviceable Overview of World War I,"This is an excellent generalized overview of the First World War. All sides seem to be given nearly equal time, although it does tend to lean to the standard British/German story so common to histories written in English.As was elsewhere mentioned, this is a nice read though for people wanting a fine, well-written overview of the war. If you already have Keegan's history, this will be somewhat redundant though."
2,Very Disappointing,"I have never seen the television series which this volume is tied to, and have not read Strachan's ""The First World War: Volume 1: To Arms"", from which much of this book is apparently excerpted. Attempting to be broad-based and to describe the Great War as a truly World war, Strachan gives equal emphasis to aspects of the war which are of manifestly disparate importance. (Spending over 30 pages tracking Lettow-Vorbeck around east Africa is a waste in a book intended to be a general introduction to the War.) From this book you would hardly know the French were involved at all. The writing varies wildly from chapter to chapter, with the 3 chapters at the center of the book the best by far.Not recommended for a general reader's first overview of the war, and not a lot here for anyone attempting to expand upon basic knowledge."
4,V. good coverage,Excellent coverage of the topic.Especially good on the areas outside the western front.Not especially good on social or economic issues.
3,Worthwhile but difficult,"I think, a very poorly written book filled with an abundance of information.There were several times that I wanted to put the book down, but because the content was so interesting ( both the written content and the great photos) I just couldn't.There so much I just didn't know, such as the extent of war in Africa and the importance of the airplane towards the end of the war.The book is very difficult to read with too many names and places and references to incidents that are not explained . Very convoluted sentence structure. A real painful experience at times but all in all worthwhile because of the information conveyed."
2,Too Much Information Too Fast with Little Detail,"Not as good as I hoped. As you probably know, Strachan is working on a series of the full history of WWI; but,I think he rushed to condense that series into this book and in doing so lost his argument (WWI is still affecting us today.) Strachan takes the approach that we should already know a lot about WWI, so if you are just beginning to study; this is not the book for you."
5,A History that's more than just a history.,"The ""War to End All Wars"" wasn't. Instead it was the harbinger of things to come. In spite of the evidence of the American Civil War, the Franco-Prussian war and several others, the Generals hadn't learned that the new technologies had changed the face of warfare forever.In many ways, the after effects of the war are still among us. It started in the Balkans, strangely enough only a few dozen miles from where the second Peloponnesian war had started, and where the Bosnian, Serbian, etc. 'wars' were fought a few years ago.In its writing style, this book almost reads like a good novel. In the completeness of its treatment of the subject, this book is encyclopedic. Aspects of the war such as the fighting between South Africa and German South West Africa (now Namibia) are covered where even some larger multi volume histories have ignored them. This is likely to become the definitive book on the First World War."
3,Could have much better,Strachan's book feels like it was simply a cut-and-paste of a much longer work. Names seem to appear out of nowhere and pieces seem to be missing. The book does give an overview of the conflict but the lack of cohesion makes it too confusing. Events are not described in chronological order and one finds things jumping between 1914-1918 a lot. I was disappointed by this book. If it were better organized it would have made a more enjoyable read.
4,The COMPLETE First World War,"While this is an abridgement of Strachan's three volume work on the First World War, it is complete in that it actually acknowledges and discusses the war outside of Europe. Most historians ignore or merely mention in passing the African and Asian theatres in order to rehash the European aspect again.Strachan lacks bias and avoids any controversial conclusions but includes COLOR pictures of the Great War which enhance and already readable and entertaining work.Best single book on WWI I have read yet."
1,Dreadful!,"Topic coverage is very thin; often the MS online ""unhelp"" contained more information. Try Alison Balter's book on the same topic rather throw your money down this rat hole!"
2,Not a book for someone new to VBA,"We are using this book for a college course and with all the typos it is very hard for someone new to VBA to learn. You trust the Experts to be correct and therefore when someone is trying to learn, they think they just don't ""get it"" when it may really be just the typos. Chapter 5 is a very important chapter, but it is very frustrating and hard to comprehend with so many errors. I agree the book must have been rushed to Press. Hope a revision is published, as a good VBA book is still needed and if anyone can do it Peter Norton can!"
1,Take so much time to follow even an experienced user,"Even I have a skill in VBA, I still found that this book was not written in a well logical concept and order. It's difficult to follow and to visualize where it is going to."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book proved so unuseful, I returned it. He only lightly skims over basic Access usage, and leaves out crucial steps in his examples. I never saw anywhere in the book the version of Visual Basic used. Find a better book!"
1,Utter Trash.,"Viewed: 11/11Rate: 211/11: Damn, The Four Musketeers? Really? D'Artagnan never received the honor of being a musketeer in the middle of the entire saga but rather to get it in the END of the book. Jeez, what the heck am I seeing in the film? It's all garbage to me. It does stay on the true path, but there are too many detours in every step of the way that it is not even one percent of what the book was all about. The film fails to depict the following virtues: honor, integrity, nobility, subtlety, courage, loyalty, romanticism, justice, comradery, and esprit de corps. What I saw in the film is a demonstration of total ineptness. Whoever made the decisions on casting should've never worked in movies in the first place. Ditto for Richard Lester, one of the most moronic directors alive. Quite honestly, how can anyone see D'Artagnan in Michael York? You must be joking me. All in all, only the cinematography saved The Four Musketeers from being a complete turd."
4,Monster THXI100-FO8NF THX Certified Toslink Fiber Optic Audio Cable (8 feet),"Needed a longer optic cable, wanted a monster cable, found for a good price, bought it. Now that I have it, works like any other optic cable."
5,Super Sound Transmission,"Good cable for a fair price! Using with a Bose Solo sound system and it was easy to connect, gives excellent sound transmission quality."
5,Mind-blowing Quality,"I have always been an audiophile, and look for the best sound that I can get out of my home-theater environment. I've tried numerous types of cable connections, including a Monster Digital Coaxial cable. I thought that sounded good, until I connected up the THX-Certified Digital Optical cable... it unleashed an entirely new level of audio performance out of my existing DVD player and receiver. I was very impressed.The price is also quite reasonable... if you're looking for a good connection for top-end audio quality, this is the way to go."
1,Rating based on overall value,"There isn't anything really wrong with this product aside from its price. I purchased this a few years back and it has worked well. However there is no reason to spend 4 to 5 times the amount on this cable versus one of the less expensive versions you see on this site. The signal passing through this product is digital. If you're using any TOSLINK cable and can hear what you expected, that is the best it is ever going to sound through a TOSLINK cable (The same goes for HDMI cables). I decided to go the cheaper route and I couldn't be happier (the connections even hold better in my receiver.) I'm angry I spent the extra money last time but I will not do it again. Don't buy into the Monster hype."
3,Have Things Really Changed?,"The book description here explains the story pretty well, so I won't reiterate it in my review. Basically, this takes the reader through a tragic, but believable scenario from the late 1980s. A woman's sexuality may jeopardize her career. It may cause her partner to lose her daughter. These things may cause irreparable damage to their relationship. These things may cause irreparable damage to Sue's daughter, Cassie.Bottom Line - This is classic Jackie Calhoun. As in many of her stories, there is an evil ex-husband and the strife of being gay. These women overcome great odds and deserve to be respected for their success. If you're a fan of Calhoun, you'll probably like this book. If you don't typically like her stuff, pass this one by for something else."
4,Sweet Fruit of Poetry,"Veronica Franco had an unbelieveable ability to write-beautifully translated and expressed in Poems and Selected Letters (Other Voice in Early Modern Europe). Margaret F. Rosenthal put this book together with careful thinking, allowing it's readers to skip to different poems and letters easily. I am not reviewing Ms. Rosenthal as much as I am Veronica Franco in her writing. The poetry is revolved around her daily events, none out of the ordinary. My particular favorite being Capitulo 13-A Challenge To A Lover Who Has Offended Her. Excellent for those interested in this portion of history, a Courtesan's life, and one who loves poetry. Very beautiful! I rated it 4 out of 5 stars-it only lacks the one star because it take a working brain to relate the poetry to what it actually means. But once done, it is well worth the time. :)"
4,Praise to M. Rosenthal for bringing Veronica Franco to life!,"Rosenthal helps the reader bring Veronica Franco, a woman courtesan (a ""high society"" prostitute)and poet, of the 1500's to life through her poetry. The current movie, ""Dangerous Beauty"" with Katherine McCormick, is a hollywood version of Veronia Franco's life. The introduction of the book is a brief but interesting and is an important part of understanding the poetry. Rosenthal gives you many details and interesting facts behind the the poetry. She also provides the reader with an understanding of life in Venice in the 1500's, often important in interpreting the poetry. Unfortunatly, Rosenthal's writing style is cold and heavy reading. It reminds me of graduate school texts. Fortunatly the subject matter kept my interest. Franco was an amazing person and is well represented in her poetry and by Rosenthal words."
1,this stuff does not smell like ginger. don't buy,I got some ginger oil from a local vendor. This Aura Cacia is revolting to smell. I don't suggest purchasing it.
4,"Yes, It Does","I noticed that some other reviewers commented that this doesn't smell like ""real"" ginger, but I have to disagree... I think it absolutely smells like fresh ginger root, with the peel and the inner core and all. I do agree, however, that this exotic, earthy scent is not likely to please everyone, and I suggest adding a couple of drops of bergamot oil to sweeten it. I bought it for its medicinal properties, anyway, not the scent. A few drops in the bath water and then mixed with almond oil as a skin rub really helps to improve circulation in my feet."
3,extremely minimal,"This release from Stilluppsteypa pushes the limits of minimalism. The first track is a very nice ambient drone, while ""Plenty Loud, Thank You"" is almost nonexistent, subscribing to the Francesco Lopez school of ""nothing is more."" On the whole these tracks are so minimal that you almost forget they're even there. Dependent upon your taste, this may be just right.... for me it starts to go beyond mere minimalism and into more extreme territories of inaudibility."
5,solid research,"I read the other reviews as well as the book. The book is well reasearched and uses stellar religious/theology scholars as well as academics in the field of parapsychology ans others. This is known as secondary research. Primary sources are possible but hard to come by, that is one would observe and report. There are many ethical issues in this. Secondary source research is perfectly acceptable in academia. Personally I would be unwilling to be present at let alone participate in a ouija board seance/reading. I would be one who did secondary research on this topic as well. The book is well written; well researched, and circumspect. It posits it is best not to open a door when you dont know what is on the other side. It gives some historical background; incorporates some theology; and discusess specific cases."
1,LIGHTEN UP -- IT'S JUST A GAME,"Lighten up -- it's just a game.The pointer moves to letters in response to the players' conscious or subconsious need to see something interesting happen in the game. It's called the ideomotor effect. Ouija Board is simply a doorway to entertainment; no more ""occult"" than poker or tiddley-winks, a lot less insidious than television. This book is an opinion piece, and not a very well written one at that."
4,good stuff !!,"Happy to see (read)some one who is willing to consider the right and wrong of something. Today's age of spiritism is greatly pursuing how to do many things but seldom considers that ""because we can"" does not mean ""we should"". Christianity (rooted in Judaism, the oldest faith in existence) has always warned of the dangers of turning to occultism for truth instead of the ""father of truth"" God. This book explains why christianity is concerned for all those who use ouija boards to explore the spiritism so common in today's culture."
3,Monkey/snake fight sequence censored from this DVD release!,"This is an excellent movie, complete with the required 'plot' thread: student gets beaten and humiliated, student improves his kung-fu, student comes back for some serious ... revenge. The movie itself is worthy of 5 stars, but unfortunately this Xenon Pictures DVD release has removed a crucial scene (and also all the flashbacks to it) where we see a real monkey fight with a live snake. Without this scene, the viewer is likely to be left wondering how on earth the student was able to come up with all his 'winning' moves. As for animal rights activists; prohibiting this sort of scene in newly made titles is one thing, but removing a fundamental plot element from a movie that was made over 20 years ago is absolutely ridiculous!"
5,Excellent,Two classics from this great band on one tape ! Both Albums still sound great even after 30 years ! A fine addition to any collection of 70's music.
4,Trying to Organize,This is a handy little gadget for storing any kind of battery. I put it on the wall in my laundry room.
2,Tester didn't work at all,"I gave the item 2 stars because it does, indeed hold batteries... although I never took the time to put any in since the tester seems D.O.A., so I'm sending it right back."
3,Barely decent quality. AA batteries get stuck in there....,"Decent organizer and well laid out design for organizing batteries. All in all, a good buy for the price. Though, some of my AA Duracell rechargeable batteries get stuck in there. Very tight fit."
4,Very simple cheap battery storage,"Tester is a bit cheesy but, hey for the price it works just fine. I put the new batteries in the top rows and then pull older batteries from the bottom rows to keep rotating stock. First time in years I don't have to dig around in two or three kitchen drawers to find batteries, then wonder if they were fresh or old."
3,"Good bye shoe box, ""Hello"" Battery Organizer","For years I have kept my batteries in their original packages in a shoebox along with a tester. When I spotted this, I thoughts I would enjoy it more than I do. We found the mounting screws very flimsy and easily stripped. Fixed that though with more durable screws. I now know at a glance how many of each size I have on hand and am somewhat happy with my new system; and I further believe that it was slightly overpriced. Next I have to get re-acclimated to my new battery organizer and stop looking for that old shoebox when a battery goes dead! Hope this was helpful to you and your decision."
3,Battery holder,"I was not very pleased with this item. Some of the AA battery holes are not drilled out enough, so the batteries won't fit.The battery checker only goes up to the ""yellow"" range for a fully charged battery. I guess it's OK if you remember this when you check the charge of your batteries."
2,Rechargeable batteries do not fit,Nice idea though my rechargeable AA batteries do not fit. AAA seem to fit snug. Difficult to get batteries out.
2,Look somewhere else,The AA slots were too small for my rechargeable batteries.The tester arrived broken. Even unbroken it's poor quality.The plastic feels cheap.I would recommend putting the money you'd spend on this towards something else.
4,Battery Rack,"Decent unit however if you are going to load it fully and plan to hang it on a wall, just make sure the mounting screws are into studs as I don't believe that constant useage will stand up to the wallboard anchors and you may find all the batteries on the floor. Included meter is just a step up from two wet fingers but it serves as a decent indication of battery strength. there are more AAA sizes than I need in comparision with AA sizes I use. Good storage for 9 volt units."
2,battery tester,I do not like this battery tester. I do not recommend it even tho the price was reasonable.The battery must be placed exactly right between the two metal strips within the vise like tester. More often than not you have fiddle with the battery ends to get it exactly right. To difficult to use.
3,Smart Solution - Bad finishing,"Overall, this is pretty good organizer. The small drawer designed for small batteries is almost useless. Some rechargeable AA batteries (different brands)do not fit easily into the slots. I am not sure if it is because the unit is still new or it is just a bad design. Not all slots are that way. The majority work. I like the battery power gauge.Overall it is a good buy. It worth the money. But I just wished they had better design and were more thoughtful about the small battery drawer."
5,Best $14 you'll ever spend.... A fantastic product,"I needed something like this to organize my batteries. I was wasting good kitchen drawer space with the tons of batteries I was buying. Buy buying this storage rack, I can look instantly and tell you what I am low on...and what I need to buy... A great product..high quality. You wont be dissapointed..."
4,Convenient Battery Storgae Solution,"This is a convenient contraption for storing batteries. I wall mounted it to save even more space. Having the battery tester near the batteries is convenient compared to having to dig out my multimetre. Some of the slots don't hold rechargeable batteries well (tight fit). Other than that, I'm glad I got it."
3,Good if you have shelf space,"I am so glad to have this; it's great to have a place to store and organize my batteries. But this organizer isn't perfect. It's not very deep, so I don't feel comfortable hanging it on the wall because I'm afraid the batteries will fall out. It would be much better with a cover for the battery compartments. And the test is a bit suspect; I've never yet had a 9-volt or D battery test as still usable. Still, I'm a lot better off with this than I would be without it."
4,Good Item,I really like how this item keeps are your batteries organized and in one place. Really glad I bought it....
4,Decent Organizer Decent Price,"Holds a good amount of batteries, not Costco quantities but normal purchase quantities. Battery tester works well for all but the AAA batteries. Not the most stylish of organizers but mounts easily and securely."
4,Well thought out organizer.,"I finally got tired of hunting down good batteries from various boxes and drawers only to find they where dead or the wrong size. Purchased this organizer and now I'm asking why I didn't get this sooner. Now all my fully charged (I know this thanks to the handy tester) batteries are in one place neatly organized in the varying sized holders. I even had a place for a button battery I found in a drawer. Why I have a button battery - I'll never know, but if my aging uncle comes by and needs one for his hearing aid, I'll know where to find it. I thought about hanging the organizer behind a utility door with the hardware provided but found it just as easily lays flat on a cabinet shelf above the dryer. Besides, I would have had to hunt down my missing screw driver that's hiding in a box or drawer somewhere. Maybe I ought to get a tool organizer next."
1,Flimsy,The battery came unglued from the container within 5 minutes of use. Brand new batteries I had just purchased barely tested as having minimal charge--perhaps bad batteries or worthless tester?
4,Best Organizer Of This Type,"There are plenty of reviews now, so I'll just add that this battery storer/organizer is handy, though its capacity is limited. Most alkaline or other conventional batteries retain their charge better at lower temperatures. I use mine horizontally in the refrigerator to maintain a small supply of common battery sizes which are likely to work. I organize the batteries to use older ones first. One thing that I wish was different is that the bottom of the battery storage holes are open (with a lip). I would like to be able to store ""AA's"" in some of the larger receptacles for ""D's"", for example, but the smaller batteries just fall through the holes with the lip. It would be nice if larger battery storage areas somehow allowed for storage of smaller batteries as well. Having the open bottoms may be needed for liquid drainage in the event a cell ruptures. Maybe some sort of grid could be provided at the bottom of the holes to maximize storage yet allow drainage."
3,Great Product but Slightly Damaged,"This product is advertised, and it arrived on time. This was the best product that I have seen, when I was comparing the various battery caddies. The only negative is that a black piece of plastic that is a part of the battery charging unit was broken off. It is not a deal breaker, but this does affect the functionality of the product."
5,Just RIght,"We already had a battery organizer that hung on the wall, but it didn't hold enough batteries. So when we bought batteries we had to put some in the holder and some somewhere else. This holder fits plenty and besides that, they don't fall out like the old one did. All around, this one is perfect."
3,Works as Intended With Two Caviats,"This works fine but there are two things I don't like about it. 1) The compartments for the AA batteries are so tight, I actually left the left and right columns empty because I could barely get the batteries out when all compartments were full. 2) It would have been better of the compartments were angled higher. I mounted this to the inside of a cabinet door. Each time I open the door, the 9-volt batteries come flying out. I wrapped a rubber band around all the 9-volt batteries to prevent them from flying. Other than that, not bad for the price."
3,"Except for AA batteries, it's perfect.","The holes for the AA batteries are too small for all but the smallest AA batteries. I have some that fit fine, but almost all of my batteries are way too tight. I mean, tight to the point you have to, literally, bang the batteries to get them in, and get pliers to get them out.Everything else about this battery rack is perfect. All my other batteries, AAA, C, D 9V - they all fit fine, and look good in the organizer. If it weren't for the peskily small AA slots, this thing would be perfect. If they fix that issue, I would be inclined to get another. Otherwise, I don't think I'd get one. That's my 2 cents worth."
1,Not sized properly,"This organizer is a great idea, but the wholes are too small use for the AA's. I would return if i could~"
2,Not worth the money,"A cheap plastic product. Holds too many D and C batteries. Not sure many people use those sizes anymore. When mounting on the wall, I had to tilt the bottom out to keep batteries from sliding out on their own. Some holes were too tight. Otherwise product stores batteries and ready to use, at least. Not sure I would recommend spending the money on it."
5,The Perfect Solution,There used to be batteries everywhere in the house..but it was almost impossible to find the ones I needed at any given time. This organizer(and tester) keeps all sizes in one compact area. I love this product!
4,really like this product,Pros - love having a tester to see if a battery is still good or not. Our 7 year old was constantly mixing old and new together for toys. I like having the holder and the different sizes. There are an adequate number of slots for the sizes we use.Cons - tester itself doesn't work very well for button batteries.
4,Battery organizer and tester,All my batteries fit well in the organizer and you can see at a glance how many you have on hand. The removable tester I found a bit awkward and sometimes the batteries registered as dead. I tested them on another tester which showed they were still good. Time will tell which one is correct as they are used. I am happy with purchase but I do wish the tester was more sensitive and accurate.
4,Great organizational product!,"SIMPLIFY! It's great to have batteries organized, off the shelf, and know at a glance whether or not you need a particular type of battery--and you can test it to confirm that it's still good! I saw this product in someone's home and knew that it would simplify keeping track of our batteries, and bought an extra for someone I know who appreciates practical things."
4,Battery organizer,Range Kleen battery organizer with removable tester arrived on time and it proved to be very helpful at testing and storing all our batteries.
1,Was delivered in 4 pcs,"Opened to find in 4 pcs. Not packed with enough cushioning. Just plain packing. Upon close investigation looked very cheap hence the breakage. Did not like the build quality, returned for refund."
5,Great battery organizer,"Hung this on an inside closet door and batterys are easy to get to, like that i can see when we are getting low on a certain battery. Was worrried that they might fall out when closing and opening door, had it installed a few months ago and so far not one battery has fallen out."
4,Handy item,This organizer is great for keeping track of your batteries and knowing which ones need to be recycled.
4,Battery storage rack,This is a really nice product. Testor works fine. Multiple storage of all the different types of batteries is great.
4,good for what it's for,This rack is useful and inexpensive but since I got it for rechargeable batteries it's not filled my need. The higher capacity rechargeable AA nimh batteries (and others I'm sure) are a little fatter and won't fit in this rack well.
3,batter tester doesn't work well,I bought this for the battery tester as much as the storage - storage is great but the tester doesn't really work except for 9 volt batteries.
3,Battery storage and tester,Great to store batteries-the tester works ok but is a little awkward to get top and bottom of battery on tester
4,nice organizer,"It looks smaller than I expected, which I like, so it can fit easily on a small part of a book shelf... It would fit easily in part of a drawer, leaving room to spare. I would like it a little better if it had a bottom that didn't have holes where the batteries are (there isn't a solid plastic piece across the entire bottom, each section has sort of a hole if there is not battery in it). In the picture it looked like it had a solid white bottom. Still all in all, you can fit a lot of batteries in it, and they are easy to place and retrieve. It is nice and solid. I like the battery gauge, although it is a bit awkward (you have to tilt the batteries)."
5,Stop the clutter-find a battery,"It's so convenient to have batteries organized in one spot, rather than rattling around in a drawer. It's easy to find what you need and see when it's time to stock up. I also have the optional tester which is very handy."
4,A very good buy,"If you have a lot of small, flashlight size batteries - AAA to D, 9 v and button batteries, this is a great organizer. It even has a handy battery tester that is removable. As far as I'm concerned, this was the best battery organizer on the web.I bought two: one for charged batteries and one to hold batteries that need to be charged.RichSatisfied Amazon.com customer"
4,Battery storage,"good Battery storage in home or shop. Some holes for AA size are a little small for some of my batterys, they have to stick out :("
5,Handy little gadget,I was keeping all my batteries in a box. This is a very handy way store batteries. Batteries fit very nicely into their designated holes. There is even a little space for the little round flat batteries.
5,Battery Storage Unit w/ Tester,"I'm very happy with this battery storage unit w/ tester. I have it hanging on the wall & it doesn't take up much space. It serves its purpose perfectly with an accurate tester & holds 66 batteries. It great having them all in one place,& easy to see what I have.Thank you.Sue Madsen"
5,Perfect Organizer,"Wonderful product! My battery drawer was a mess. This organizer eliminates all guesswork about about what sizes I have and what sizes need replenishing. Also, got rid of all the messy battery packaging. The battery tester is great too. I liked this organizer so much, I bought as gifts for my kids."
2,Don't mount it on the inside of a door,"This works fine except I mounted it on the inside of a cabinet door and the batteries fall out when the door shuts, unless you close it VERY gently. If you mount it in a stationary place, it would be ok. But I specifically wanted it inside the cabinet door out of sight and out of the way. Does not work well for that."
4,Keeps me organized,I mounted it on the wall and works very nicely. I also really like the built in battery checker. My only complaint is I wish there was a drawer for more oddly shaped batteries.
2,Unhappy,I was disappointed with this product as the majority of batteries did not easily fit in their respective spots. You would need to push them in with some degree of force making removal quite difficult.
5,Great little organizer for gadget users like me!,What you see is what you get in a well made and well thought out battery organizer!Far better than hunting for the right battery in a drawer.
3,Mount it and leave it on the wall!,"Two problems. First when taking it off the wall be VERY careful. I was having trouble taking off the battery meter (does it slide up or to the side...) so I took the organizer off the wall. BAD IDEA! A little jolt and about 30 batteries spill to the floor. This REALLY needs a little tab or notch to hold the batteries somewhat securely.Second issue I found after picking up half the batteries one's leaking... I put it to the side and investigate the tray and it's not going to be fun to clean it out, have to get in there with an old tooth brush to get all the acid out."
5,Keeps batteries organized and easy to find,"I love this thing! I was always scrambling around on the shelf for batteries. Now, I can see exactly what I have."
4,very nice with removable tester and lots of storage for batteries,"This is very nice because of the removable tester and having a great bit of storage for the batteries themselves. My husband seemed pleased and did not crinkle his nose and say what did you buy this thing for???? Again I read the previous Amazon reviews and then made the purchase - I am glad I did. The other kind we have can stay in the motor home, this one is for our home so even I can use it, When/if I need a battery that works, I can test it before I go to use it."
3,Range Kleen Battery Organizer,"I bought two because one did not hold enough of the batteries I normally use. They are a little overpriced, but hold the batteries in place and they are easily accessable. I already had a battery tester, but having one available with the batteries is a good feature."
4,A Nice Spot For Batteries,This works real well to keep batteries of all different kinds in one spot. The compartments aren't labeled like the directions say but I'm sure no one would have problems figuring it out. :) Some models come with a toy compartment screw driver shaped like a battery but this one doesn't.
3,Battery holder,"Not bad, a little light as far as the material, one of the screw holes was broken, but I was still able to screw the holder onto a wall where I now have my batteries. Wish it would have held more batteries but it's workable."
2,Range Kleen WKT4162 66-Battery Organizer with Removable Tester,Was excited to get battery tester and storage unit. Needs more space for AA & AAA batteries and less space for larger batteries C & D. Tested all my old batteries to find the majority still registered in the tester good. When I use those battries they did not work even in a tooth brush was does not demand that much juice. So testing the batteries is deceptive - show juice but in reality not!Don't waste your money if your looking for a tester or even for storage unless you've got lots of bigger batteries
2,"organizer=4, battery tester=0","The first day that I received this organizer/tester I tested all the batteries in my home and placed the good ones in the organizer. So far the tester is working well and everything is pretty good except storage is limited for AAA and button batteries. One day later the tester stopped working completely. The unit was replaced and the replacement battery tester tests virtually every battery as good even though they are used and do not perform strongly. This was also confirmed with my volt meter. As an organizer it is pretty good, but don't buy it for the battery tester. It is basically worthless."
1,my rechargeable AA batteries don't fit!!!,I have over 30 rechargeable AA batteries & a mess of others so I bought this just to organize. I haven't used the tester. VERY disappointed my AAs do not fit in all the slots they are a hair too big in diameter! I am returning it. I am so disappointed as I love it otherwise this would have been perfect for my drawer but my batteries just don't fit in all the slots only some of them!! ARRRGGHHH
1,Tester broke in few days,This is a great idea but the tester broke in few days. I threw to garbage many batteries that I believe were still working.
2,Tester doesn't work,"Ordered two organizers, one for re-charge batteries, one for regular... plastic organizers came as promised, but neither of the two batt testers worked at all...so you end up paying 12 dollars for just the plastic organizers...I still have to get out a volt meter to test batteries..."
2,Adequate at best,"I am keeping it because it was cheap and there are surprisingly few battery organizers available. But this is the barely adequate. It should have more AA and AAA spaces, and half of the D and C spaces. Or more all all. The biggest problem is that the spaces for the AAs are too tight for rechargeable AAs. Rechargeable AAs tend to be every so slightly larger than alkaline AAs so this is not a great choice if you use rechargeables [I personally think alkaline AAs and AAAs should be be illegal, because they are old tech that needs to die, and stop polluting the environement. Plus, why would you buy a battery you can only use once? Really?] Some company needs to step up and offer something good in this category so that using rechargeables is less of a hassle.Oh, and the battery tester does not work. Not worth the bother to return it."
3,It's Nice to Have an Organizer,"It's really nice to have one place to put all the batteries. With three kids, we have a bunch of stuff that needs batteries, so we're always getting more. In the past, we've forgotten what we already had, and bought multiple packs of the same size. Having one central location helps with that. I really like having a battery tester built in, so I can check the batteries coming out of a toy--sometimes only one is bad. It also means that I can check batteries before putting them in something, in case they've been sitting around too long and have lost their charge.The one drawback to this storage rack is that there are too many slots for 9-volt and C batteries, and not enough for AA and AAA. Someone else with a different mix of stuff might disagree."
2,Battery Tester only lasted 1 month,Battery Tester only lasted 1 month. I found Shaper Image model battery tester lasted. Unknown what failed internally on this model.
4,Pretty neato!,"I bought the Range Kleen Battery Storage Rack. It comes everything you need to install it yourself. Simple, clean and it fixes my battery mess that was bugging me in the desk drawer."
1,Needs some more work,"This is the second one of these that I ordered. The first one the holder worked great, but the battery tester would test brand new batteries (right out of the package) at the ""low"" reading - no higher and no lower. So I returned that one. The second one I received - this order - the battery tester needle seemed to get stuck so I would test the brand new battery and then it wouldn't go above the low end of ""good"" then I would take the battery off of the tester and the needle would stay where it was and then in a couple of seconds it would go back to it's non-testing location. I think it was ""dragging"" on the part of the tester that showed the scale for replace, low and good. Would not recommend this tester as it seems very cheaply made."
3,Keep getting damaged products,"I bought one of these for myself some time ago and it's fine and I like it. But when I ordered one for my mother, it arrived and the battery tester would not work on the side that tests AA, AAA, C, D, etc. It did test 9V. So I contacted Amazon and was shipped a replacement without a problem. The replacement tester was also damaged. The metal contact was missing on the side that tested AA, AAA, C, D, etc. Again, it would test 9V. I like mine, but after receiving 2 damamged products in a row, I now question the reliability of my own."
1,Battery Holder,Battery holder is just OK. The tester is hard to use & not reliable.Bought from Amazon .com The holder holds a fair amount of batteries. it works best mounted on the wall.
5,Battery Organizer,I purchased this Item for my Father as a Birthday Gift~All I can say about it is~It did look like a nice Organizer and my Father was Happy when he received it~As far as rating it? I have not heard as whether it is a Good Product or not? So I am rating as far as looks~
2,Battery Rack,"For cost ok for storage. Checked two battery and wiped out the tester.Maybe ham handed but tester was of low quality. Use flat or screw to wall, batterys fit lose in pockets."
4,Batteries not included,"Have been on an organizing rampage and this was a must have for our utility. We really like this item and it has eliminated all of the random batteries. If you find a battery, test it with the built in tester. If it works, it goes in it's slot, if it doesn't into the trash.Pros+ Hanging option is nice and battery slots are angled to keep them from sliding out+ Built in tester is great and makes sorting out old batteries a breeze+ Rigid plastic, should last for years to comeCons- As others have mentioned the watch battery drawer is almost useless but may fit your needs- Could have used another row of AAA slotsOverall I think this is a better more accessible option than a battery case and recommend it."
3,ok to use,"every thing is fine. just wish they can seal this whole thing in a covered plastic box, that will make it perfect for storage and transport."
3,Not bad for the price,"I rarely review items... This is a decent product for the price. The battery tester seems to work well. The holes for the batteries are very tight in some and fit fine in the others. I am fearful that if i push the batteries in , that it will be difficult to pull out. Overall not a bad storage solution though"
4,Nice & Solid. Slots are a bit tight,"Nice product. Solid construction, lots of room for batteries. Easy to hang. Tester works great and is easy to use. The only thing that I don't like is that the holes for the batteries are really tight, making it difficult to get them out. Particularly on the AA's. But don't let that stop you from buying it. It's a good product."
5,Perfect for the laundry / utility room wall.,"Mounts easily, batteries stay secure. Tester is simple and works... There's even a little storage area for a few button batteries. It's the perfect addition to your laundry room, shop, garage or utility closet wall."
4,Almost a perfect product,The battery tester is okay but I wouldn't trust it. I really wish there was more room for the AAA and AA compartments. I screwed this in the wall inside my hall closet and it has been really convenient. I'm thinking about buying another unless I can find something similar with compartments for smaller batteries (AA and AAA).
4,Organized,"I hung it on my wall, tested the batteries but my question is who has that many D, or C batteries? I would like to see more AA, AAA"
4,Simple yet well organized,I like the compact & organized design with the battery tester built in so it's not lost. Perfect for a drawer or hung up on a wall.
3,"Nice organizer, but some holes don't fit the batteries","This is a nice organizer that can hold a decent number of batteries of all types including button batteries which are stored in a small removable drawer next to the batter tester. It can be used standing upright or lying down.My only complaint is that a few of the holes for the AAA batteries don't seem to be sized correctly, as batteries that I put into them don't slide all the way in. I thought that it was possibly a problem with the battery, but I've tried multiple batteries and got the same result. After reading the other reviews, I guess I'm one of the few that I got a bad one.It also comes with a simple battery tester, which indicates if the battery is good (green) or not (red). I already had a volt meter, so I don't really use it.If you need an organizer that comes with a battery tester, this is one to consider. If you don't need one, I would recommend looking at other organizers that are much less expensive."
3,Batteries didnt fit :(,I ordered 2 and in some slots the batteries did not fit i tried contacting the manufacturer no luck and amazon was of not help! Miss the good old days!
3,"It's good if you NEED it. Otherwise, look for something else.","The big disadvantage is that you can't adjust the size of the beam. It comes out in a fairly narrow beam, and there's not a lot you can do to change that. However, keep in mind that none of the other production snoots offer this feature (that I'm aware of). Because they are so easy to make yourself, you should consider making a snoot first - at least to determine whether or not your lighting situation actually requires one. I bought this over 3 years ago, and have only used a handful of times. (See ""customer images"" for some samples). Consider a Honl grid, instead, if you want to narrow the beam of your light."
4,A must have for photographers who love to experiment with light,The only reason this product hasn't gotten five stars from me is that it could have been slightly better built... the flaps on the back where it attaches to the Velcro are too rigid... But overall a worthwhile purchase... Would buy again...
4,Great,"I had a tire with a very slow leak that we just couldn't find so for months I was adding a few psi every day. I bought this because the little tire filler fitting that came with my compressor was junk, in made a 40second job of adding air into a 3min job because it never got a good seal. This made it a 20second job because it has a built in pressure gauge. I did test the gauge in comparison to a digital one I have and it was accurate withing a half lb. would be 5 stars if the gauge faced the other way...every now and again I would let go of the handle and it would pop out and hit the bent hose."
2,"Inaccurate, hard to read gauge and chuck must be perfectly aligned...","I returned this item. I agree with the other reviewer that the chuck must be perfectly set in order not to leak. At the same time you are trying to get this right, you must ensure that the gauge is turned to face you if you want to read the numbers on the psi scale. Since the gauge pops out, you can't tell which side the psi readings are on until it is out, and I often found it facing the other direction. Lastly, I found the readings to be much higher during inflation. Once I released the chuck, and then reapplied it, the readings (confirmed by separate gauge) were easily 10% lower. For the price, it looks good. But I'm going to buy a different inflator that is higher in quality."

5,Vascular adhesion molecules and inflammation - worthy to hav,"If you are a scientist and your work is connected to either vascular biology or inflammation you will have pleasure reading this book. The first chapter brings you a wonderful ""historical"" background in vascular-inflammtory studies. Other chapters are very informative reviews of biology of selectins and other adhesive proteins, interaction of blood cells with endothelium and even analysis of inflammatory responses in a xenotransplantation model. Yes, read it!"
4,Best quality CG for a series ever!,"Roughnecks Vol 2 Is an incredibly good value disc. It consists of 5 episodes connected together to form a feature length, top quality CG fest. The action shifts to the jungle planet of Tesca. Realistic natural scenery and some cool new bugs feature, but a new crew member is introduced, while another is missing - this causes confusion because the disc completely skips a chunk of episodes based of other planets, and introducing the 'skinnies' race, and other plotlines.Definately worth getting, but they could do with sorting out the continuity errors by releasing the discs in sequence!"
1,Don't Bother,"This was an incredibly disappointing book. It isn't even about transracial adoption--it's all about theorizing about race. The author talks about her theory of ""racial navigation"" as if she invented the idea! And you can't get a handle on what she's really talking about because it is totally removed from the reality of transracial adoptees' lives. If she had ever talked to someone who lived the situation she might realize that regardless of what she calls it, people are always doing it. I mean, if you are black and you have white parents and you've grown up around white people then you have no choice but to figure out how to ""navigate"" that. It isn't some great revelation that she bestows on us. It's a lot of pontificating supposedly about ethical choices adoptive parents make, but all she really talks about in that sense is whether or not it is racist for white parents to choose to adopt white kids. This is not a useful discussion. Don't waste money on this book."
2,enterance to sea world.,I am a mate of merchant ship. And I read this book in korean. This book is very interesting to introduce people to sea.
5,A Twisting Mystery with MUCH Appeal,"I had to read this book for school, and, as most of the previous books I had to read had been, I expected it to be very boring. I remember remarking to my mum, ""This is going to be soooo boring."" It definitely wasn't! It's a fantastic tale, switching between going back in time, and visiting Peggy who is living with her Uncle Enos. While at times it's not AMAZING, it's certainly always good!"
1,I put up a bunch of reviews there,"Sheldon's portion is great. It's an interesting background on a philosophy. The rest is the most masturbatorial text you'll ever read -- and it praises the tragically mediocre. I worked there over the course of the two managements. It's horrible now. Of course, nobody asked me or fellow cast members who could actually make me laugh."
2,Self-Congatulatory Text/Superb CDs,"Patinkin has scribed a look back at Second City that is full of self-love for all the club stood for and all the comedians who traipsed through the door. The book would have benefited from a more honest account that featured the failures as well as the successes.The two compact discs are worth the price you'll pay for a copy on the used book club market, however. They are full of funny bits featuring many famous comedians, and will give your money's worth back in laughter."
5,Masterful and compelling...,"Listening to Tia's music is like climbing aboard a magic carpet, as it enters your mind and carries one to distant times of magic and mystery, of things both beautiful and haunting. Hypnotic and strangely addicting, it's sure to quickly become a staple of your cd collection."
2,Cacophonous Nonsense,"You know how it is when you are looking for totally new music? Sometimes you lay your $20 bill on the counter and just take a chance. Sometimes you find something completely new and inspiring in New Age. Sometimes, particularly with New Age, you just lose. Well, with ""Blackwood"", I just lost. Sure, Tia Knight has perhaps two good cuts on the CD. I'll give her credit for that much. The rest of the music? Ouch! Rather than focusing on the fundamentals of Music Theory 101, she had to see what kind of sounds her electronic instruments were capable of making. The result sounds like the mating of two Maytag washing machines. It's souless and silly. Rarely do I throw a CD in the trash can. Regretfully, this time I did."
1,I can't believe this album got such good reviews!,"I'm sorry; I'm a big fan of artists like Loreena McKennitt and Enya and Kate Price, but I don't understand why this artist is compared to them. I bought this album on a recommendation, and by reading listener reviews, but this is not my cup of tea. For the first time, I bought music that was just a waste of my money! Both my friend and I compose music on the Trinity and the Triton, and frankly, we come up with MUCH better music than the material on this bogusly overrated album!"
4,Thorough discussion from a scientific point of view,"Perkins dares to throw away laymen's theories about creativity, and supports his case with theoretical considerations as well as with examples from reality. Do not expect a simple book. Perkins discusses in great length scientific research in the creativity field, as opposed to the many ""creativity cookbooks"" you'll find."
4,A condensed version of larger books.,"Not enough variety to make it a general opening book (Winning Chess Openings by Yasser Seirawan), nor a book specifically focused on one repertoire (The King's Indian Attack by Eric Schilling). The Openings discussed are somewhat in random order and therefore there is no real focus. Though a good book, very instructive and well written, I would not consider it a necessity for players. If you want to cram on a few popular themes then this book will fit your needs. All levels can read this book, but intermediate players (1200-1600) may utilize this book best."
5,Scrooge Lover!!!,This movie has to be one of the most amazing movies ever! I have grown up watching it every Christmas and I just can't ever get enough of it. It's a must see!
5,Classic Family Christmas Movie,"This movie has been in my family's collection since it was made. We all gather to watch it every other year; the other year, we watch It's a Wonderful Life. The songs are really quite catchy. My family and I would play ""The Minister's Cat"" on long car rides, and I continue singing ""Thank you very much"" throughout the year. The ending is a bit controversial and could be scary for younger kids. I love this movie. It is definitely very different, and a bit long, but it is a GREAT Christmas movie!!"
3,quality issues,The DVD was shipped and delivered in great time. The DVD itself has production issues as if it were originally in another language and redubbed in English. tough to watch.
3,Good movie,"I recently watched Scrooge the Musical and also read A Christmas Carol. The movie was much more entertaining, and easier to understand. The novel was hard to pay attention to, he didn't have expression in the way he talked almost like monotone. Also the words in the novel were sometimes way to unfamiliar which took away my interest. I like reading novels that catch my interest right off, and this didn't. Maybe it didn't because we've all heard the story before. If I had to choose I would pick the movie over the novel because it grabs my attention more. The movie would have been better without the musical aspect though.From: Kieyana and Amanda"
4,scrooge christmas classic,possibly better than the original because of the movie being a musical as well as the movie of The scrooge . Albert Finny is fantastic in his demeaner as the miser scrooge. His dancing ability and comical sterness just blows you away. I have watch at least 4 versions of this Christmas classic but have never laughed at any of the other versions. The story itself has earned my attention for years.I always look forward to watching thisaround The holiday but this year I had to buy it on cd and watched it in july. Still the best one ever for me . Frank
5,A family Christmas tradition -- at last on DVD,"Most on the previous reviews say everything I'd like to say: this is a wonderful movie with memorable songs and a great performance by Albert Finney (as well as much of the cast). Yes, it takes liberties with Dickens' text, but so does almost every other version of ""A Christmas Carol"". But ""Scrooge"" captures the heart of Dickens' message--of regret, repentance, and redemption--and still moves me deeply even after 30+ years of seeing it. Many of my (mostly-grown) children say that ""Scrooge"" is their favorite Christmas film (along with the hilarious ""A Christmas Story"").I saw this film in its original theatrical release back in 1970; there is a lot of visual impact lost in the VHS pan-and-scan version. (I still remember my acute disappointment seeing it on TV the first time.) I'm thrilled it's now out on DVD; we bought copies for all our childen (ages 18-30) for Christmas. Thank you very much. :-) ..bruce.."
5,Heartwarming Classic,"This is by far my favorite live action version of the story ""A Christmas Carol."" Albert Finney is an exceptional Scrooge. This is definitely a must have if you enjoy the story. When I found out this came out in Blu-ray I had to get it."
5,Best Scrooge!,"This is my favorite Scrooge movie of all time. Everything in it is so amazing. The special effects for the day were top notch (who knew they could make a ghost horse ride through the house that long ago?). The musical numbers are great (and I despise musicals). The acting is marvelous! And you can understand them.This is a Christmas tradition in my house, and it should be in yours too!"
5,This is definitely one of my favorite versions!,This is an excellent version of the story - and the music is great! Albert Finney makes an excellent Scrooge.
3,"Scary, but good","This movie is sort of scary. Especially the scene with Marley & Scrooge floating through the air with all the ghosts around them. And Scrooge's big house is creepy. All the scenes in Scrooge's house are a little scary. But it's presented well. The songs are good, especially ""December the 25th,"" and ""Thank You Very Much."" It's a great Christmas movie."
5,The Best Christmas Carol Version,"Okay. Lets get something straight right from the beginning: the reviewer who said that the songs aren't even really that good is well.....dead wrong!! They are great. I started watching this as a teenager, and it is the best 'get in the mood for Christmas' movie.I have been looking for this for years as a DVD and am elated that is is finally here. Get this DVD. It's wonderful."
5,"Musical, lots of music","This is a long movie, but, it is great, Albert Finney is terrific.The music is terrific. I watch it more than once a season.Ghosts are very convincing. Dialogue is close to that in the book.A section of hell is included, most movies leave it out.Thank You Very Much, sung by the soup man is my fave.This is the first Christmas movie I watch, usually on Black Friday"
5,Why Not in DVD Format?,"this is the most wonderful holiday movie that exists! We have watched it each year to kick off the holiday season. It truly captures the essence of Dickens' Christmas Carol. However, we want to purchase this movie in DVD as our VHS copy is beginning to show wear. Do you know when they will release this in DVD format? It truly is a classic that is cherished by our family and has been since it's release."
3,Weird but good!,"Nice but weird adaptation of A Christmas Carol, Albert Finney was quite good as Scrooge, Alec Guinness normally was an outstanding actor but his performance as Marley was too campy and over the top, I just felt he hammed it up a bit too much. Though some of the songs in the movie are forgettable the songs December The 25th and Thank You Very Much were nice. Though not my favorite Chrstmas Carol movie I do have it on video and it is defintely worthy to be in my video collection because despite the campy and very weird portrayal of Jacob Marley it's really a nice entry in the crowded Christmas Carol video market, I also have to agree that a G rating is very misleading and it probably should have been rated PG."
5,A Favorite Christmas Movie,"My entire family thinks this movie is terrific!!!!!!!!! The music, the actors,the comedy all add such depth to this film.I definitly would recommend this film to anyone who wants to buy a REALLY GREAT Christmas movie .I'ts A Wonderful Life is also a favorite christmas movie.Check it out!!!!!"
4,Good Musical Adaptation of a Christmas Carol,"My wife and I both like this musical version. I still like the black and white Alastair Simms as Scrooge, movie as my all time favorite Christmas Carol."
4,Our collection,This is one of the best Christmas Carol movies. We have had the video tape for 20 years and were glad to add this DVD to our collection of Christmas favorites
5,Singing Scrooge,"I love this version because it is a musical, even Albert Finney manages to croak out a decent melody!I saw this first in the movie theatre with my parents and then grew up watching this over the years. It was along with An American Christmas Carol, my favorite version. I had it for many years on VHS and replaced it with DVD this year. A must see for dark humor and great music!"
5,SCROOGE Soundtrack - Gimme music!!!,"This movie has brought the Christmas spirit into my home for decades. I would love to play the soundtrack while stringing popcorn and cranberries for my freshly chopped tree before the pine needles hit the carpet. Does anyone have any info on when the soundtrack will be released? Signed, 'Old Potato'"
4,"""Thank You Very Much""","I looked for years, made many 'Scrooge' purchases, all in search for my favorite musical Scrooge with the song ""Thank You Very Much,"" and I've finally found it!!! So, I bought 6 and gave them away to my parents and siblings at Christmas, because we'd all grown up having seen this movie on TV, and then none of us could find it for years. This is truly a 'feel-good' Scrooge movie, and you'd be missing a great Christmas tradition if you don't buy this and watch it every year."
4,As advertised,I go this as a gift for Christmas. Got it int he time I was told. It is a classic and well loved in this family.
4,WERE IS THE OVERTURE,"Scrooge is one of my favorite movie musicals. I saw it at Radio City when it was released. I've had the original DVD for a long time and when I saw it was released on Blue-ray I had to have it. Well what happened to the overture that was in the original movie and DVD? I thought when they issue movies on blue-ray it was supposed to have the complete movie and many features. Not a happy camper since the music was so good and the overture gave you a glimps of what was sung in the movie. Other than that, the blue-ray addition is wonderful. I would have given the dvd 5 stars, but because it's missing the overture, it only gets 4. I'm also waiting for the soundtrack to be released on CD. It's a wonderful score."
3,Scrooge,"I love this musical. Albert Finney's acting is great as always. It's unfortunate that the sound quality is not the best. Thank God for Caption! Keep the volume up with the caption on so you can enjoy the only Christmas musical made of a great classic movie, Scrooge."
5,Scrooge,We love this movie. We have owned it on DVD and wanted to continue to enjoy it each year so I purchased the DVD.
5,The one and only Scrooge for my family,"I haven't seen the 1950 version of Scrooge, but this version is the only one my family ever watches on Christmas. I absolutely love it. The acting is great and the music incredible. If you haven't seen this version I do recommend it!! You won't be disappointed. Albert Finney is great in it!!"
5,Scrooge - Alec Guiness and Albert Finney,"I really would like to get a DVD version in the near future, is there any plan by the publisher to do so? It is my favorite version of Scrooge, both the acting and the music are wonderful."
5,One of the best Feel Good Movies ever made,I first saw Scrooge in 1970 at the theaters and it left a lasting effect on me. Now my family watches it every year. Once again the critics really missed the boat on this one. The songs in Scrooge are simple and fun. I would love to see a remake of this movie with the same songs and old fashion feeling it gives. I thought I was the only one in the world who looked forward to the holidays just because of this movie.I am happy that there are many other Scooge Fans out there. SEE THE MOVIE
5,The best version yet.,Thhis musical version of A Christmas Carol is the best version yet. The music and the scenes bring a special meaning to Christmas. You will continue siging Father Christmas long after watching this special musical Christmas Carol.
5,A must have for the holidays,"This is a delightful version of Dickens' classic ""A Christmas Carol"". The songs may be fluffy for some, but they will stick with you and bring a smile to your face well afer Christmas. The holidays are not complete without viewing this film. Albert Finney is wonderful by the way."
4,Great Version,"This Version of Scrooge, I saw when it released in the sixty's. Always loves it, decided it was time to own it."
3,Scrooge the Musical,"National General's ""Scrooge"" is a musical and as such the viewer may expect that some liberalities will be taken with Dickens' text in order to fit the song-and-dance routines created for the movie. In that presumption, one would not be disappointed. Diversions from the text are legion and many new scenes have been created to accommodate musical numbers. All the films take liberties with the story but this one may top them all. Many love it however. Best characterizations are by David Collings as Bob Cratchit and Kenneth More as The Ghost of Christmas Present. You can read more details about how this and other film treatments compare to Dickens' original novella at dickenscroogemovies dot com."
4,Great childhood movie,Good movie look foward to watching it every Christmas holiday.great acting and good songs the whole family sings along. Good family entertainment
4,Scrooge,"I've seen all the Scrooge movies,this one the best especially the ending. Albert Finney is magnificent in his portrayal of Scrooge. The sets are amazing! This movie has been a Christmas tradition in our home for many years. This is a musical so if singing in movies is not your cup of tea then this movie may not be for you, but give it a try I highly recommend it"
5,A Christmas Tradition,"This movie is a Christmas tradition at our house, as is Shepherd's A Christmas Story. It vividly portrays the cold, miserable winters and the contrast between the poor London and the rich London of Dickens' time. I want to sing and dance along with the song ""Thank You Very Much"", and I get hungry when I see the bountiful table that's presented at the arrival of the Ghost of Christmas Present. Albert Finney is a great Scrooge, and Marley is a bit of a hoot."
1,scrooge,I did not wont a dvd from the UK it does not play in US dvd players. now i have to wait to get a US dvd
5,life saver,Thank you from the bottom of my heart for having this movie!!! i got it for my bf for Christmas me and him been look for this version of scrooge. cuz its his fave. and u guys saved my Christmas with this lovely movie so thank you again and again.
5,Best Version Out There,"I have quite a collection of movie versions of A Christmas Carol, and Scrooge is by far my favorite. This version, with the colors apparently redone for DVD, looks amazing (especially compared to my old VHS copy).One thing that I don't think I'd noticed until this year's viewing, was that Leslie Bricusse, the lyricist for Willy Wonka, was also the lyricist for this movie. I find it interesting, given that they are two of my all-time favorite movies."
5,A classic!,An outstanding musical in a setting long gone by. Nostalgic but not sappy. I must see! It is a wonderful adaptation of Dicken's short story.
5,The Best Ever Created,"I am of African American decent and I have seen and enjoyed many movies, but this one has had me hooked ever since the first time I saw it as a child. It has hope and a variety of musicals. It offers a person ages 1-100 a reason to care for another and feel great about doing so. I am very impressed with each character and the children's performances were terrific. Although I'm in my thirties, I look forward to the holidays in hopes of catching it on TV atleast twice before the New years. I will share this movie with my children and we continue to enjoy every moment while being glued to the tube.Hats off to Albert Finney!"
5,"Great cast, sets and wonderful tunes. An outstanding musical","Out family is so happy to be able to get a new VHS tape - We have had only a scratchy beat-up ex-library copy. BUT what we really need is a DVD. (we hope soon?) Albert Finney is the best Scrooge ever and the singing and dancing are marvelous. This has to be right up there with Oliver, Mary Poppins, and Sound of Music as a great family movie. (Even Tiny Tim is charming, in spite of his tinny squeaky little voice.)"
3,No Overture and Exit music,Well I just received my blue ray disc of Scrooge with Albert Finney. What a disappointment. the Overture and Exit music are missing. The Film has reverted back to CBS who made the laser disc. I guess who ever transferred the Film thought it was not necessary. The DVD is Complete. I can't understand why they didn't include the two pieces of music. The running time is with the Overture and Exit music included.Just can't understand it.
5,Good Viewing Musical,I replaced my original DVD version with this one to upgrade our holiday library. The sound and picture make this an enjoyable Blu-Ray!
5,Best Scrooge ever!,I watch this movie every year! It is a musical. It is absolutely the best! It really puts me in the Christmas spirit!
5,That's the nicest thing that anyone's ever done for me...,"I always look for this title every Christmas season, at every retailer I can think of, and I can NEVER find it. Well I FOUND IT ! Well a friend did (Sir Duane Hendershot, see his outstanding review below 12/14/2000) and I'm scooping it up! I can remember watching it for the first time as a kid, and because I was more interested in sledding or throwing snowballs, I didn't think much of it. Then after seeing it season after season (and maturing...some would disagree) I realized what a cool movie it was. The songs are catchy, the actors amazing and the story... timeless. The more I watched it, the more I picked up, and the more it made my holiday season complete. I can't wait to get it in the mail and let my wife get a chance to enjoy it too. My hat is off to the folks that made this movie... Thank you very, very, ver-ry much!!!"
5,Loved It!,Fantastic. Tried many stores and shops and u helped me usher in the holidays with this timeless classic that was once a broadway musical as well.
4,Favorite Christmas story,Not my favorite version of Dicken's Christmas Carol but had to add it to my collection. Probably won't watch it much though.
1,"wrong, no return, I lose.","ScroogeThis DVD is in European Format and won't play on my DVD player. The cost of return mail to Great Britain is $8.00 and the DVD cost $10.00, not worth the exchange. Thanks alot. Peter Golden."
2,Where's the Music?,"This is the worst version of Scrooge I have ever seen. I bought this video because I love musicals, well the music in this movie is sadly lacking. While the songs ""Thank You Very Much"" and "" I Love Life"" are wonderful songs, they are done so poorly in this version that it is painful to watch. The casting is awful! Scrooge looks like some old backstreet drunk, rather than a miserly old man. I can't imagine what the thinking was for the casting of the ghost of christmas past and an elderly woman. The best parts of the background story of Scrooges life are left out of this version almost no time is given to even develop any sympathy for Tiny Tim and to much time is given to the parts with the ghost of christmas future. The ""hell"" scene is particularly awful.I do not reccomend this movie to anyone!"
1,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to recieving my dvd , only to find that when it arrived I was not able to play it on my English dvd player.This was not really made clear when I puchased the film.I must say that amazon were really good and did not charge me for the dvd. But the disappointment was there non the less."
1,Did not ever receive the package!!!!,Haven't been able to track the package - no help and haven't received it yet.. one month later.
1,Madness takes its toll!,"I really don't believe all the rave reviews for this stinker. To start with, the musical numbers are annoying at their best, and quite disturbing when they sink to their lowest. Further, how dare anyone call Finney's performance the best Scrooge, or even place it in the top ten? Will someone explain to me why he chose to play the character as a developmentally delayed adult? He seems to have based his performance on a resident of a group home at which I once worked. Rent it and make your own observations, but don't trust the hype!"
1,Scrooge-a pitiful excuse for a christmas movie,"I'm sorry but to be the bearer of bad reviews but in my point of view this movies really bit the big one! The new ""scrooge"" should be banned in america for untasteful acting and horrible music! I can't stand this flick."
1,You've got to be kidding....,"This was the silliest thing I've ever seen! Come on, a SINGING Marley? This was as bad as the Mr Magoo Christmas Carol I remember seeing as a kid. I pulled up the reviews to get a chuckle with other folks and was very surprised to see all the 5 star ratings."
5,Best Scrooge musical,"Memorable songs, familiar characters, wonderful imagery and special effects, all add up to a great musical adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic. Finney's querulous old miser is very well done. Scrooge is written as more than just a master of high finance: he is a local money-lender as well, and all the little people who owe him money are portrayed with warmth and sympathy. His sips of the ""milk of human kindness"" brings an appropriate warming to his cold heart, and his sorrow and later redemption warm the audience's heart as well. Turn up the music, and enjoy the show!"
5,The best Scrooge ever played!,"This version of The Christmas Carol is one of the best! Albert Finney does a wonderful job of portraying the miserable Scrooge. A must for a ""Christmas Carol"" collection!"
5,I just love Albert Finney in this role,"Albert Finney does a masterful job as Scrooge, and the rest of the cast is on par. I know many who say that the Alistair Sim version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is the standard by which all others are measured, but I find this version superb. I will not enjoy another Christmas without watching this with my family."
2,Blah!,"I didn't like this version as I felt Albert Finney didn't do justice to the part of Ebenezer Scrooge. I have seen it but, didn't buy it. Not worth it!"
3,Scrooge,Always a great story regardless of who adapted it or starred in it alhough I think Finney is poorly cast. Too grundgy and dirty to be an anal and bitchy bank queen but the music is delightful and the supporting cast excellent.
2,Thank You Very Much,"This is really a very good movie. The performance by the cast is first rate especially that of Albert Finney. The sets are great but the best part is the music. Father Christmas, December the 25th,I Like Life and Thank you Very Much are very very good and performed very well. This is one of my favorite Christmas moviesgbark"
3,"Don't like muscials, thank you very much","Not a bad movie, and ""Thank You Very Much"" is a catchy tune. I haven't seen the movie in years, but I remember the song quite clearly. I also recall that it was sung by the peasants of Christmas Future in thanks to Scrooge for having the goodness to die. Cheerful ditty. ..."
5,Great Dickensian Atmosphere...,"scary ghosts, singable songs, wonderful Finney as Scrooge and Alec Guinness (!) as Marley...a musical even I can stomach!!I first saw this as a kid and loved it. When I finally found it on video, probably 30 years later, it hadn't lost it's charm. The London scenes are obviously shot on a movie lot somewhere but it doesn't matter. Dickens' story is brought to life!"
5,Christmas Musical,This is one of my two favorite Christmas movies of all time. Albert Finney turns in a wonderful performance as Scrooge in this masterly musical.
5,Great Classic for the Holiday Season,One of my favorite of holiday classics....Anyone who enjoys this story will love this one.
5,"Wonderful, absolutely wonderful!","A true Christmas tradition, and an absolutely delightful score. An adaptation that would make Charles Dickens smile. The songs will instantly become Christmas favorites. (I wish they were available as a soundtrack). Order and enjoy, for many a Christmas to come."
5,Love this movie!,"This has been a favorite Christmas film since I was young. As it is rarely shown on television, I knew I had to purchase it, and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.com !"
5,FINALLY ON BLU-RAY!,"This is the ultimate for all Scrooge fans. I will not go into the film, we all know those details. The film has never looked or sounded better than this. While watching it you will notice wallpaper textures, be able to read the old adverts in the backgrounds and see details in the costumes and scenery you never knew where there before. What a treat this is on Blu-Ray and well worth the wait. Go get it!"
5,Definitive Version of Dickens Staple,"I was turned on to this version of Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" by a co-worker and I am forever in her debt. It is at once lively and colorful and brimming with wit. The song score, with a few excepions, isn't particularly memorable but I give it a pass for the high spirited delivery. The film's signature tune, ""Thank You Very Much"" is introduced in a wickedly delicious manner. The song is sung at Scrooge's funeral procession while the local soup man dances on his casket. Albert Finney is nothing short of genius as the cantankerous Ebeneezer. Probably thirty-five at the time of release and with little makeup Finney suggests Scrooge's elderly malevolence with a hunch and a scowl that seems surgically implanted. Alec Guiness also assays an interesting interpretation of Marley's Ghost. I gather this film probably met with a lukewarm reception upon initial release but forty years on it holds up quite nicely, thank you very much."
5,ONE HUNDRED STARS...,"I HAVE WATCHED MANY SCROOGES BEFORE BUT I WATCH THIS ONE, FAITHFULLY, EVERY YEAR AND MY EYES ALWAYS GET WET BECAUSE OF JOY. ALBERT FINNEY IS AN OUTSTANDING ACTOR. I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH THAT I RECENTLY BOUGHT AN AUTOGRAPHED PHOTO OF HIM FOR MY COLLECTION. THAT ""THANK YOU VERY MUCH"" HAS SO MUCH ENERGY AND THE LOVELY SONG ""HAPPINESS"" IS WONDERFUL. DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. THOSE REVIEWERS ARE NOT PERFORMERS. I AM AND I KNOW HOW HARD PERFORMERS (ACTORS, SINGERS, AND DANCERS) HAVE TO WORK TO ACCOMPLISH A MASTERPIECE OF MOVIE OR MUSICAL LIKE THIS. THANKS A BUNCH MR. FINNEY!!! YOU ARE A DIVO!!!"
5,Amazon Editorial-Heartless,Whoever wrote the Amazon editorial must have a heart of stone and is tone deaf as well. This is an absolutely wonderful Christmas musical; just look at all those 5 star comments.
5,Review of Scrooge,"This movie is wonderful! I have had it on VHS for years. My rewinder quit, and I couldn't find another, so I upgraded to DVD. It is great, and it was in perfect shape!"
5,Geneva Saga,"The McGillinen family is wonderful! This book is funny, warm, romantic with plenty of adventure and face paced action. Braden loses his heart to Kerry who is as kind as she is beautiful. His son Benett, by his first marrige, is adorable. Kerry's protective big brothers are funny and tender as they hover over her not too sure about the 'Brit' who has stolen her heart. The villian is wonderful and it's a laugh a minute when he gets what's due him. A must read...I couldn't put it down!"
4,The Melody Lingers On,"'The Mills Brothers Story' is a long overdue look at the greatest male singing group of all time! For over 50 years they entertained the world with faultless harmonies, that never failed to enthrall and delight their audience. Whether singing alone, or teamed with other greats like Bing Crosby, they made it look so easy, yet no one has come within a bull's roar of emulating their unique sound.This DVD has much footage of them towards the end of their great career, but the famous 'sound' is still in tact, even though their health was not good during these final years. Quite a bit of early footage also, of which I probably would have liked to see a bit more of, but still a gallant effort of giving us a look at the overall saga of these 20th. Century pioneers of 'group' 'Pop' singing. A must for anyone interested in true rhythm & melody."
5,Great book and not out of print!,Your information is incorrect. The Woodland Steward is not out of print and it IS available from the publisher.
3,Japanese Highlander,"You should be able to find this game quite cheap now, and it would definitely be worth it.Just like the latest Shinobi game in the way it plays, with the combo system and everything.A lot of really immersive qualities with the music and the dreamy graphics.The story does nothing. It makes no sense and adds nothing to the game.The camera is awful, and the controls are awkward, but you can see past all this."
3,"Well, umm, yeah...","I did like this game, but there were some problems (just as all things have). The art of the game was fantastic, the music was very period and yet retained a simplistic beauty that was the heart of this game, and the game play (characters, controls, over-all story) were all very good. My only real complaint was the repetitiveness of the title. ""Oh look, a demon, combo combo combo dead... oh look a demon..."" and so on. The coolest part of this game was the fact that the very earth could be smashed into tiny bits, but even that turned into trying to smash the environment rather than demons. I just felt like there are about at lest one thousand games that involve timed missions to smash things, and we really didn't need another."
4,Fun but dont like the stages idea,"This is a really fun game, great fighting format. But the one thing that got on my nerves was that the game was set up in levels. Like most super old games there is a section between each area to alow you to save, change equipment and check about the next level. But this is a real drag after a while when your in the middle of a level and have to go, or the boss is one type of magic but you have the same because you needed it for the other creatures on the way there. Also the game gets pretty hard and boring, I was hoping it would get better the farther i got but it didnt. Over all the games dissipointing, but i cant wait for Ninja Gaiden to come out."
2,controls suck,"Otogi seemed great when first put the disk in. The first thing I noticed was the controls are horrible. Look around and movement are reversed when using the thumbsticks. Which means it is really hard to get used to the game play. Its like trying to write with your left hand if your a righty. This makes the game impossible and no fun. There's no way to reconfigure the thumbsticks. If someone found a way, please write it in a review. If your ambidextrous, go for it."
3,"It works, but is it really worth it?","Like others, I didn't want to attach sticky velcro pads to my nice, new Nikon SB600 flashgun. The cinch strap does an admirable job of attaching the diffusion hood to the flash, but it doubles the assembly time. The soft rubber triangular pattern on the underside of the strap grips the flash body very well, but doesn't lock it completely solid. It does get displaced slightly after a few mins of manhandling the camera. If you put the flash on a tripod, this is not a concern, but if you're hand-holding the camera and moving about a lot, it might be.I have bitten the bullet, stopped using the cinch strap and just stuck the 4 pieces of velcro to the flashgun now. Much quicker to set up and holds the diffuser more rigidly."
4,Useful thing,If you do not want to mark your falsh gun forever with glue and you are using accesories to disperse light this is the best choice.
4,Color Blind,"The cover is of excellent quality. However, the color is not exactly as stated. It's more of a mocha color than khaki and the piping is definitely brown, not black."
5,excellent kindle version,upgraded features words of christ now very readable. very easy to navigate. excellent addition to my kindle library.
3,Print too small !,"I don't know how you would have described the type in this Bible to alert me that is was going to be so small, but compared to an earlier version of this that I've had for years, it is VERY small! Even with my glasses it was not a comfortable read. I did see that it was available in ""large print"" but I have never really needed that before so I didn't order it in ""large print"". I guess I should have!"
4,My New Bible,"I knew I could get a Bible downloaded on my Kindle and so I did. I am still getting use to navigating around, looking up specific books, chapter and verse. I like the convenience."
3,bookmark feature does not work well,"I really like reading the NLT, so my issues with this product have nothing to do with the content. I wanted to use this for my daily Bible reading. However, when I bookmark a page, then open the book the next day, the bookmark I left the previous day is gone. However a bookmark from days before is then the only one in the book. I go to the page where all bookmarks are stored, and the bookmark from the previous day is not there. The bookmark from the previous day appears a couple days later. So it's very hard to keep track of where I am without writing it down somewhere else. This has been happening for months. It makes the product a lot less desirable for me. No other books I read have this problem. All the other books I read have bookmark features that work fine. So I don't think the problem is with me or my understanding of the bookmark feature, but with the product."
5,Bible that is easy to take with you,"I have to admit, I haven't read this yet. It is in nice shape though, easy to take along and understand. If you are just getting into religion like I am, this is a great starter bible."
2,Disappointing Kindle Version,"The NLT is my favorite translation of the Bible. I have paper copies, but, I wanted a version for my Kindle.Unfortunately, there are two problems with it. The red letter sayings of Jesus are rendered a light gray, almost unreadable. In addition, the Chapter links are not arranged wisely. Making it difficult to navigate to certain sections.Very disappointed with the rendering. With some minor adjustments by the publisher, this would be an excellent addition to a Kindle library."
5,Wonderful work of Art,There's no other bible like it on earth! This bible breaks every single scripture down for clear and concise understanding. It totally reads like a book and it's so difficult for me to put it down. I love it! I highly recommend this bible to all who are ready to accept the knowledge within. This bible is a true blessing!
2,Not what I was looking for...,"I bought five of these to give to a family we've ""adopted"" for Christmas and am returning them. The size of the print and the yellow color of the paper makes it too difficult to read comfortably. I like the things they have written in the front and the layout fine but would rather give these children something easier for them to read. I also hadn't realized they didn't have the words of Jesus in red, which is a real plus to me."
4,Easy to read and understand,"I bought this bible for my mother. She loves the large text. Her only complaint is that it is really heavy, but it is a nice hardcover with good binding. It is a great value.Kay Burningham, AttorneyAuthor of ""An American Fraud: One Lawyer's Case against Mormonism."""
3,Great Giant Print - But not the updated NLT version,"Love the Giant print, truly easy on the eyes.However, for those wanting the newest updated NLT (2004 major update, 2007 minor update) - this one is not the updated version.I have read just the beginning of Genesis and can already tell the difference - like reading 2 different versions, old NLT to updated NLTWish they would give the new version an updated name to be able to tell by the title which version it is. (for now have to look at copyright date)"
1,Never received this item,"While I have read the Bible all my life, and am currently going through ""reading the Bible in one year"", I did want this book available on my Droid. But I have not received it. Would love it if someone at Amazon would look into this. I'd still like to have it."
3,NLT Bible,Was disappointed to find only the New Testament. I thought I was getting the whole Bible and there was nothing to indicate thatthat wasn't the case. Also the pages come up in a dark colour and are hard to read.
4,NLT Bible,"Easy reading and easy to find your way around unlike other Bibles that you can lose your place easy, especially if you are moving from one book to another."
5,Great for Baby boomers !,This translation of the Bible was done by those familiar with the words and customs of Biblical times.Also done by several people not a few. The print type makes the reading so much easier on this Baby Boomer's eyes. I really like the translation and the print. I love reading God's Word. And this Bible is a pleasure to read.
4,New Living Translation,This Bible is very easy to read with the larger print and easy to understand as written in modern english.The only negative I can say is that the pages are so thin that the print on the back of the pages show through some.
5,New Living Translation,For those of us that haven't studied Greek or Hebrew. This Bible is in everyday 21st century language.I personally read my New King James first - then read same passages in this one for a deeper understanding and revelation of what it is God is saying TO ME.
4,Giant Print Bible,This is probably the best bible I have found based on its print size and translation. The NLT translation I like and the 15 point type! yes 15 point type is awesome. It makes reading enjoyable again. Recommend this to anyone with trouble reading small to regular print or even anyone as I think they would find this a more enjoyable reading experience with the giant type. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star rating is due to the fact it does not have the word's of Christ in red.
2,Very small print!,I was very disappointed when I received this copy of the bible. The print is so small that it is difficult to read. I guess I should have done more research.
1,no stars for what can't be used,"After purchasing this for my Kindle from Amazon, it is unreadable. After further investigation I find that the book sold for a Kindle is only useable for a Nook. Not a good move from Amazon. I have not tried to return it yet. but I will. I purchase books so I can read them, Not just look at the title in a list."
2,Wrong Bible delivered,"Ordered Holy Bible Text Edition NLT (Bible NLT) 3 different times. Received Living Bible translation instead 2 times. Received NLT SAMPLE 3rd time. Returned all 3 bibles, was refunded and I went elsewhere for what I needed. Appears catalog is listing NLT but you are warehousing the wrong product."
5,Holy Bible Text Edition NLT,"I am very satisfied with this Bible.I have been using it in Church and Sunday School. Everything is easy to find. you can underline,highlight,and get definitions easily.Thanks alot!"
5,Holy Bible New Living Translation,It is great to be able to read this version of the Holy Bible and to be able to adjust the size of the font fro easier reading.
1,"The books ok, the version's wrong","Too much important scripture is changed in this version, especially prophetic passages. It's no translation, it's much more like a paraphrase. Some times in minor things it's more accurate than the KJV, but they've changed really important scriptures, and that's not good. Don't buy it. If you want to reference it, compare it online at Biblegateway.com..."
4,NLT Edition of Holy Bible,Holy Bible text edition NLT it is easy to read & understand. Have one already but this is easy for travelling
5,Great for Youth!,We bought these Bibles to use at our new started Youth Group. I think they are great for teenagers who are not used to read the Bible. It's easy to understand and it makes them want to read more.
5,Holy Bible Text Edition NLT,"This Kindle edition of the New Living Testament is great. It's fairly easy to navigate through, although I really don't care to use my Kindle in church because I can flip back forth so much easier in my regular Bible. I do love this version of the Bible; it's easy to understand, and interesting, while still holding true to the Scriptures."
4,Great,Excellent translation - my favourite. Quick search good. Don't see how to access others notes and highlights. three more words.
5,God is good and this book is great for e-reference,"I find this to be a great edition and translation for the Kindle. It is easily searched. If you don't know Him, God is great and all the instructions and encouragement you need for life is here for the taking. He is knocking...you get to open the door"
4,Holy Bible NLT version,"Product as described. Very good condition, plus super fast shipping. Very satisfied with purchase, price was unbeatable."
2,Poor Kindle Rendering,"Poorly formatted for the Kindle. It is a""Red Letter Edition"" that renders words of Christ in a very light grey - difficult to read - I ran it by some seniors in their '70's and they lost interest quickly. Maps included are copies of color versions from original hard back edition, grey scale limitations of Ink system not factored - maps are unusable. Cannot zoom in to view. Columnized TOC wastes screen space. Search capability of Kindle not taken advantage of. No commentaries, dynamic links or annotations included. Overall I was very disappointed. I hope an update edited for the Kindle will arrive."
2,"New Living Translation, Giant Print","Giant print was great but the pages are so thin, the words on the back side of the page bleed through and make it hard to read."
4,Positive upgrade,"From just a quick glance, there appear to be several improvements in this edition, including a number of welcome retractions. For just one example, notice that the ""guilt trip"" language of Romans 12:1 has been removed:1996 Ed.: ""And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice--the kind he will accept. When you think of what he has done for you, is this too much to ask?""2004 Ed.: ""And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice--the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship him.""At least in the second edition, I don't hear my mother's voice quite as loudly!"
5,RE-mastered--or not?,"Can someone who has purchased the Rhino Flashback version tell me: does it say it is ""RE-mastered?"" Thanks."
5,Hello Big Man,"This CD is great. I don't know how I ever missed this one -- it was the only one of hers I didn't own. I'm always thirsting for ""new"" Carly Simon music, and this satisfied me until she releases her next one. If you're a Carly fan, you should buy this one."
1,Please enter a title for your review,This band really have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Rock n roll is supposed to be energetic and aggressive. This is the most lifeless mid-tempo garabge I've ever heard. How could anyone like this? How could anyone sign and release this? How could anyone even write this? I don't get it.
3,There's Only Now ~ Eskobar,"I am not saying that this is a particularly bad album, it is just not all that interesting. The vocals are average, the lyrics ok and the sound very generic. Their manager should have told them to get decent hair cuts as well and what is up with those tacky looking leather jackets. They are quite plain looking and should have had something other then their own faces on the album cover. What they wear in the book-let is much nicer and seems a bit more personal then what they wear on the cover. They have major potential that is dragged down by the quite avergae sounding music and lyrics. I will give them another try..."
2,There Are Much Better Choices,"I hate to disagree with the other reviewers, but this vest has a number of problems:- It's made of cotton. When it gets wet - rain, sweat, whatever - it stays wet. If you are in the tropics, before too long it starts to smell like old socks. In the Amazon basin it actually developed a decent selection of molds.- It's hot. It doesn't breathe well, so it gets sweaty in a hurry. Which takes me back to point #1 above.I replaced my Domke with a Big Pockets. Unlike the Domke, the Big Pockets has a nylon mesh liner, which keeps it from getting as sweaty. The Big Pockets is made with synthetics that dry more quickly and seem to better resist mold and fungus. And the Big Pockets has padding on the shoulders so that my tripod doesn't bruise me.Sorry, but I cannot recommend the Domke PhoTOGS Vest."
2,Camera Vest,"Too large and heavy for my purposes. Was looking for a lighter weight vest and was surprised at how heavy the material was. If shooting in warm climates as I generally am, would likely be too warm."
3,"beautiful vest but very difficult to size for a female, and no free returns because it's not marked as apparel!!","I'm a female - despite the chest size being appropriate (which I had to google, because nothing on Amazon gives any guidance as to size), this item does not fit in the hips. And due to some insanity on the part of Amazon, this is not classified as apparel, so my only recourse was to return it on my own dime and a refund, not a replacement. Bad show. :(Otherwise, I think it's a very nice garment, very soft, well built and I love the ability to carry photo gear so easily. Decided, though, to go with the jacket with removable sleeves, so that it's more useful (price was about the same today, so I got lucky on that)."
4,Timeless music that speaks to the soul,"I heard a piece from this CD on internet radio, and it quite took my breath away. The production and artists are all first rate. Some of the cuts are so beautiful they can seize your full attention as your mind regales in the performance."
4,A High schooler's review,"As a high school student, I personally found this product very helpful. The templates were fairly easy to work with and ran affectively on my school (1995) computer. The templates were relatively self-explainatory and easy to work with.Like your previous critique, I was surprised that the product was only templates organized within a web like interface. I really expected more."
3,Has some helpful areas,"The book has too much info on the history of OBD, who cares. It needs more troubleshooting help. Like decision maps. It has some vehicle specific info, but again not enough. It is somewhat helpful for the beginer to OBD."
3,Computer Codes,"This book said it covered to codes for our car but it did not have the correct code #s. I ""assume"" that it has the older code #s. We have a 2002 Toyota."
3,Code book for cars,This book is really vague when it comes to the codes. It only has a few possible reasons and not all. There seems to be a trial and error system needed to make the statements work. Sorry but I can go to O'Reilys and they will come out and tell me exactly what I need from there machine and never have to look in any book. I gave my code reader and this book to my son.
5,I Love It,It helped me as soon as i cracked it open I have a 94 and it pointed out just what was wrong
1,Not any help,In the cover picture and discription it says nothing about 1981 thru 1995 pre OBD II but it clearly shows these words on the cover of the book.No use for a 2007
3,Not Compatible In Australia,"Great Book, Except Its Not Compatible For Australian Vehicles. If There Was A Manual For Australia That Would Be Great."
2,music critic,"Outdated but did help, if you have older cars, with OBD1 this will help, not much value on 1990's era and up cars."
3,FUN!,I really enjoy reading about Winnie ;she's got a nice personality! I think these are good books to read for horse lovers.
4,great book for horse loving girls,"it's sweet and interesting, and honestly enchanting to horse-loving girls. winnie's wild personality suprised me at first, I thought she'd just be a shy horse girl."
1,Interesting,Really really interestingly git not not not not not not not no no no no no no no no no nono
2,Trite,"This book is a fluffy little trite read. My daughter enjoyed reading it, but only mildly. She loves all things horse, but would have liked some substance."
4,An informative read,"This book by Dandi Daley Mackall tells the story of 12 year old Winnie Willis and her pursuit of a beautiful white Arabian horse named ""Wild Thing."" Although I'm far beyond the age group this book was written for, I still found it to be an enjoyable read, and one I would recommend to all young animal lovers, especially horse lovers. Not only was it a nice little story, but you'll actually learn a lot about horses and the training process. Above all, Ms. Mackall weaves a neat story of family and forgiveness and the faithfulness of God."
4,Nice read for young girls,"This was a cute sweet book. A great book for a young girl. I thought it was lacking quite a few details but a young girl might not miss anything. If it was longer it wouldn't appeal to the younger group. I really liked the characters. I loved ""Catman"" I found him to mysterious and fun. All in all - a pretty good book."
4,Perfect Tween Horse-fanatic story,Well written story for young people. Winnie has a connection with horses and young girls who live for barn time will like her immediately.
5,Wild Thing: 1 Review,"Received this product for free on my kindle reader for my phone. I used it as a distraction for my oldest daughter, who loves horses. She would often ask to read this instead of play! She loved the book, and asked me to buy more in the series. This book is great for the horse-loving girl in your family, and it doesn't involve too much ""older drama""(love, boyfriends,etc.) as most pony books do."
5,The book,I love horses and it was very interesting and I liked it very much.In some parts it was sad.
5,"Refreshing, interesting, good tips on animal care","Winnie is a very-believable character with flaws, and she grows. The series appeals to girls' love of horses, and has good lessons about animal care and other aspects of life. The characters are believable and interesting! The struggles with fitting in at school are universal. What a refreshing break from the plethora of witchcraft and sex which is so prevalent now!My daughter has read through the series before; last week she saw me reading one of the books, and practically grabbed it out of my hand! She's now plowed ahead of me and read through the whole series again!"
4,Winnie Book Review,"I just finished reading this book last night. Winnie by Dandi Daley Mackall is a Christian horse fiction for young readers. The character, Winnie Willis, is a 12 year old lover of horses. She knows her stuff to!Cover: Wild Thing There was one disturbing part that I felt should have been kept out. When Winnie takes a job answering questions about horses through email, she decides to open up to a customer called Hawk. She tells this stranger more than I think she should at 12 years old.Other than that part, the book was good. I can't say excellent, I have read better horse books. I like that there were Bible verses used in the book and references to how much God loves us.All in all, this is a book I will keep for my daughter to read. We may even have to get the rest of the series!Disclaimer: This book was given to me by Tyndale to read and review with my own honest opinion."
3,Cute Story,"That's about it, a cute story. I really did feel the author either had experienced or knew someone that had experienced the frustration of the main character. This is a good book for preteen or teen readers. Especially those who are horse smittened."
4,Quite Entertaining!,"I think that this book is great! It's not the best book I've read because some things aren't that realistic. But it's story line is well-thought and interesting. The characters are mostly believable, but there's some things that would probably never have happened. Being a horse-lover myself, I liked this book a lot! I'd already read all of the books, but I thought that I'd enjoy another read. I like to re-read books :D! As some other random suggestions for books, if you're a girl, you'd probably enjoy the rest of this series and another series called the Andrae Carter Series. It's a remarkably good book series and I wish that I was able to read all of them, but I have only read about half. Enjoy the book!!!!! :)"
4,About Wild Thing,I chose the rating to be 4 because I thought it was really good and I enjoyed it but as this is a horse book I didn't understand what she meant half the time Winnie always mentioned the fact that her mum died and that it was her fault because we didn't know what happened to her mum until the end so I was a little bit confused. I would recommend this to people who are very fond of animals and especially horses and cats.
5,"Of memory, belonging, and difference","Memory -- its presence and its absence, its wonder and its terror, its helpfulness and its harm -- weaves its way through Laura Hendrie's REMEMBER ME like a minor-key musical leitmotif. Rose Devonic, lifelong resident of tiny Queduro, New Mexico, struggles against the memories of the townspeople; the failing memory of her sometime-nemesis, Alice Pinkston; the bittersweet memory of a family killed in a car accident when Rose was just 16.This is a novel about belonging and difference, remembering and forgetting, acceptance and rejection. Hendrie makes you care about Rose, seeing the world through her slightly offbeat, but clear and decisive eyes.I opened REMEMBER ME at bedtime and turned the last page at 5:00 AM. I couldn't rest without knowing how Rose's life turned out.Read this book. Now."
4,"A very interesting, subtle book","I will admit that it took me at least 50 pages to get ""into"" this book. However, once it grabbed my attention, I was hooked. The characters are incredibly human -- flaws and all. The ""heroine,"" Rose, elicits sympathy, impatience and furor from the reader while the dementia of her charge, Alice, is almost mesmerizing.The one complaint, if it can even be called that, with this book is that it always seems as though it is setting up some great metaphor with the embroidery (seemingly the only industry of the town), but that metaphor is never fully developed."
5,"Memory, Survival, Belonging, and Love","Rose, a 29-year-old, stubborn, proud, homeless orphan lives in a town in the mountains of New Mexico. The town, whose livelihood is selling traditional embroidery to tourists, is controlled by the Embroidery Committee, and it is not friendly toward Rose, whose family died in an accident 13 years previously. Gradually the nature of the accident and its psychological repercussions are revealed through Rose's relationships with the town policeman, the grumpy motel owner and his sister who has Alzheimer's Disease. The characterizations are beautifully drawn. The book explores the questions of the importance of memory, what it takes to survive, and the rumors and misconceptions present in a community."
5,Hurrah for Remember Me,"I think that Remember Me should be featured at every internet and local bookstore site as one of the most interesting books to come out this year. Laura Hendrie has developed her characters to such a depth that you recognize, if not a family member, at least someone you intimately know. If you have ever traveled in the Southwest, then you also recognize Queduro; a struggling community of people just barely making it and dependent on a totally unstable resource. The narrative presents human conflicts in a touching, humorous and unnerving way; it leaves you contemplating the meaning of family, community and home itself. I enjoyed this book immensely."
1,Forget this book,"No fully developed characters and a plot that goes nowhere and is itself uninteresting,...I can understand why an author would want to title a truly forgetable book ""Remember Me.""However, do yourself a favor, and don't bother reading this, then you won't have to waste energy trying to remember why you bothered to read it.Other reviewers have mentioned that the first 50 pages are hard to get through. There isn't a 50 page section in the book that isn't hard to get through. By the time I was 50 pages to the end, I still had to force myself to read the last 50 pages and finish it."
5,Nothing comes close,"I have had mine for the last 5 years and it has stood up to 40 rounds of play a year. You cannot go wrong with a Sum Mountain. Customer service is excellent. The foam on the handlebar wore out after 2 years and Sun Mountain shipped out a replacement part, no questions asked. I would recommend getting the optional cart seat."
1,Shipping problem,The product was fine but they shipped it to eastern USA where it was signed for and the FEDEX tracking number they sent me was incorrect because FEDEX said they shipped it to the correct place. After I complained they said it had to be shipped there before it went to western Canada.WHAT???? They then shippd it regular postal service and I finally received it but very very late.
4,Two special episodes.,"In ""It Came Upon a Midnight Clear"" while Monica (Roma Downey) waits in a storm with young Joey (Paul Wittenburg), worrying about his brother Wayne (Randy Travis) who is out in a storm, she tells him a tale of another Christmas when Mark Twain (played by two time Tony Award winner John Cullum) suffered a crises of faith. Helena Carroll, Kate Fuglei and Paul Winfield also guest star.In ""There But for the Grace of God"" Tess (Della Reese) takes to the streets to help a proud businessman (Gregory Harrision) who has become homeless. Ken Page (Broadway's ""Cats""), Marion Ross and Malcolm-Jamal Warner also guest star."
5,Love this book!,"This book is well titled, it is a sourcebook for investigations -- specific to the native bumblebee. Most books on bees cover the honey bee and the commercial aspect of their ""commercial"" value. This book is specific to native bees which are so vital to the environment and ecosystem as native bees. It is one I keep at hand on my book shelf."
4,Great head set,"This is a great headset. The USB connection is easy and makes it more portable. It is great for VOIP or gaming commutations, i.e. Ventrilo or Team Speak. The only problem the phones have is that the ear cups are a little stiff to start with. If they were softer I would have rated the head set higher."
3,class,I bought this for a class. It was in decent condition and the price was great. It had a good selection of poets and poetry available.
3,Too much talking,"I was disappointed in the fact there was so much talking and not enough singing...I am used to Meatloaf being ""exciting"" but this format did not do it for me..."
1,Pass on this volume. Volume II is better.,"I found a website that said these two (Light Classics I and II) were ""sonic blockbusters"". Volume I, is far from it. Chesky made a good attempt at revitalizing this cd, but the attempt failed. In no way is this a full range recording. Any bass is sadly lacking, making this a thin, budget like CD recording. The selections and performance are not exciting either. I would PASS on getting this CD. But Volume II is an entirely different story!"
5,A great tea for healthy blood sugar,"I drink this tea regularly after meals and my blood sugar is better than ever! After a month of regular use, you can actually see it working whenever you check your blood sugar. I'd recommend this product to anyone with high blood sugar."
1,Couldn't get past the taste,I tried the Tea straight and in coffee. I just couldn't get past the taste and ended up throwing the remainder away.
2,This is no Masterpiece!!!,"This import neglected to mention that the entire ""Masterpiece"" portion of the CD consists of edited cuts with the exception of ""Law Of The Land"". Why issue a CD of edited cuts? If space was an issue, then 2 discs would be fine. I would have paid the costs regardless. ""Hey Girl( I Like Your Style )"" is cut to 2:38: this is one of the Temps all time classic love songs originally 4:36. The fact that the ""Song For You portion is full-length only distracts from the enjoyment of this classic group. No more imports!!"
5,a different pow story,It's a good read. Different from life in Hanoi. I don't know how this woman lived through this ordeal..
5,EVS Sports Brace,I bought this brace after undergoing surgery for posterior shoulder instability. The first brace I bought kept sliding up when I played (basketball). This isn't specifically made for basketball but it has been great. It keeps the shoulder feeling tight and compressed and doesn't ride up or itch.A great product and inexpensive too.
5,Excellent Collection,"This CD is a must have for collectors of classic rock. Original artists, original versions, sure to bring back a lot of memories."
2,Cookie Cutter FPS with Bad Graphics,"Wow, this game was entertaining for all of 5 min. Game play is buggy and cumbersome. Story is lame. AI is weak. Multiplayer follows suit. I would have to invent some wildly unlikely story to justify the people who sold this idea to Atari."
1,This game gave me hemorrhoids,"I have never had such a pain in the (...) playing a video game as I have had with Dead Man's Hand. I've had 4 consoles in my lifetime and to date this game on the Xbox is without a doubt the worst. Targeting is the worst I have ever encountered. The crosshair will sometimes not even be close to the target but will register a kill when other times up close with the target dead on it will be a miss. On the mine level, I completely fell off the game grid and was looking up at the floating houses above me while I walked on a black plane through the mountains. I finally had to restart the game to start playing again. I will check other players ratings on games before my next purchase of any Atari product."
3,THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS,"This Game is OK (I have not played the game on-line), but the graphics are just OK. The scenery is good, but the character models are not the most fluid.Collision is also a problem. I shot right at the head of an enemy and the shot missed, however when riding a horse and flailing into the wind with lead, I hit every enemy. Even if they were not even close to their target.Another problem is the load times. It seems really slow to load, and gets stuck in the loading process.The game is a typical FPS, and it is pretty fun, but there is probably no reason to run through the game once you complete it. This game should of been so much more, but what do you expect from a game that was originally cancelled by the developer a couple of years ago."
2,good for the price...barely,"Western setting for an arcade style game. Easy to pick up and play, this is a shooting gallery with very little AI demonstrated by your opponents. The single player game is fun but exceptionally simple. It is hard to believe that it uses the Unreal engine.The Xbox Live multiplayer is fast and furious in deathmatch. However, it is exceptionally glitch prone. Connections get dropped even when good, the Mansion Level often disarms the host, shotguns are actually less powerful than the smallest pistol, and your profile with your game progress can mysteriously become unretrievable.As the only current Western Gun-Fight for the Xbox, it's great! In any other sense, it is a considerable dissapointment."
4,made by atari!,"do not buy this game. its another atari rip off. their games never work properly on xbox live in which atari is so trying to corner. they made a complete mocery of unreal2 and refuse to patch! this game wont work and wont be fixed as well. just look at the price for one, and u2t.a. was 40!"
5,Texas Country,"Johnny Lee is one of my favorite singers, and whenever I think of him, I think of ""Urban Cowboy"". This CD has some good songs on it, such as ""Lookin' for Love"" and ""Cherokee Fiddle"". Johnny Lee is a true country singer."
5,youll like every song,"every song on this cd is terrific. well worth the money used or new. no disruptive rock music here, just good cowboy singing his heart to words. my favorites are lookin for love, bet your heart on me. john 4:14"
4,Great compact bag,"Just the right size for a small slr system...i carry a nikon d40, sb600 flash, nikon 50mm lens, a small camcorder and still have a little room! Also love the hip bag for hiking and climbing!"
3,THIS GAME IS THE LEVEL WHERE YOU CAN CLASSIFY IT AS OK,"backyard basketball is ok...its not the best game in the world as you probably have ur own favs...i think the only thing that is entertaining is the games, especially horse...my fav character also is the liitle tutu girl!"
1,Makes PS2 gamers look bad even knowing about it,"Horrible, no other words can describe it. its like imagining michael jackson as a kid with no ACNE!!!!!"
4,Good: a little too bright and distinctly blue,"This is a totally functional night light. The automatic shut-off sensor shuts it off when other lights are on in the room. For my taste, this light is a little too bright. It is fine for a hallway, but it would be too much for a bedroom. Also, the color is distinctly blue."
1,Poor Quality Control,"The very first time I removed it to place it in another location the blades that plug into the wall pulled out and stayed stuck in the outlet! Very dangerous! I had to hurry outside to shut off the circuit breaker before anyone might touch the energized metal blades sticking out of the outlet. The blades are supposed to be soldered into the inner circuit board but they both had what are referred to as ""cold"" solder joints. Very poor QC work during assembly. I don't know how they got a UL approval on this thing. I put it in the trash."
3,Ok. But not much light,"Yes, as other say, the louvers are a pain to position. And like every other LED nightlight I've tried, the light does not 'project' very far. Nothing I've found yet beats the soft, yet 'full area' illumination of a regular incandescent nightlight bulb. But at least with this LED (being reviewed), the light is not 'harsh'."
4,Brighter than I expected,"This little guy puts out plenty of light for a short stairway or a small room (I use it in my bathroom). One consideration: the louvers, being white, reflect as much as they direct, so they don't really concentrate the light much in a particular direction. And as another reviewer mentioned, it is a bit large so you can't put a 3 prong plug or a power cube into the adjacent outlet. But most two prong plugs will squeeze in.Edit: I recently noticed that the light sensor in this unit isn't as sensitive as the similar light I replaced. So be aware that if the place you put it doesn't receive much light during the day, it may not go off in the daytime. This is a very minor issue though because it draws so little power."
3,let me turn it off,Pros:This unit is small fitting into an outlet in the same housing as a light switch. The light is bright enough so that I don't have to turn on a light to see momentarily. I have been using it for close to a year now and it still works well.Cons:It somtimes lights under daylight conditions. The product would be better if I could turn it off.
3,Price is Great,"These are not bad, but we found we liked the rechargeable night lights that stay on during a power outage more than these. Of course, the self-recharging LED night lights are 4x the price of these, so it really depends on what you need."
2,Feit Electric NL6 LED Theatre Style Night Light,"I bought three of these after seeing something similar at a another home. After having them for a few weeks now I'd have to say the biggest problem is they are far too bright. The plastic louvres in front of the light are far too thin and really dont direct the light at all, instead it just shines right through them. They're fine in the evenings but the one closest to the bedrooms ends up being unplugged most nights because its far to bright. If they were less bright or had thicker louvres they'd be great."
1,cheap,"i bought a set of these rings for my marlin model 60 got em mounted on the rifle just fine, but the loosning and tighning of getting the scope positioned correctly made the threading on 2 of the ring screws rip out, if you can set you scope dead on- first time and not have to retighten anything then this item will be fine for you but if your a normal human being and have to tighten , loosen, reset and tighten your rings again then you dont want this item, cheap, cheap, cheap, metal. could not even shoot it had to throw them away before i got done setting the scope"
1,terrible,"Save your money, if i could get mine back i would want it doubled. Filled with spelling and grammer errors (page 27 ""The Big Kahuna Burger"" was not only eating in pulp fiction"". I'm pretty sure that should be eaten, and a comma not a period at the end.), i run across several facts that are just plain wrong (page 17 ""In Fairbanks Alaska a law forbids elks to have sex on the streets""... ok first off elks isnt a word, its just elk, and second off there are no Elk in fairbanks alaska, the law is about Moose. I live in Fairbanks, its a well known law from the early 1900s with a funny story about why it is a law, but there are NO ELK in interior of Alaska) Save your money and buy a book that at least went through a spell checker or a grammar check, and for God's sake, if you are gonna call them facts , at least make sure they are facts!"
1,Bla Bla -- Bad Bad,This book of trivia had the most typographical errors of any book I have read in 40 years! The grammar was also questionable on many pages. Even its facts were sometimes way off - Elvis Presley's deceased twin brother's name was Garon! (really Aron)Save your $9.95 and buy a really good trivia book.
2,Different kind of book,This book had some interesting tid-bit facts. Would have been nice if I had received it as a gift rather than purchasing it myself. I read through the book once a lot of the facts I had already known and some were very suprising.
4,600 Incredibly Useless Facts: Something to Talk About When You Have Nothing to Talk About,This is a fun book with lots of things people generally don't think about knowing.
2,This one is only okay.,"I can't say I did not like it completely. However, I will say I wish it had more ""wedding"" specific detail. I just feel that one page with a large photo and the other with text is a bit of a [let down]. The text side of the page would explain some things on what to look for in the accompanying photo, but it wasn't anything you would not have learned in basic lighting, portrait photography, or other books that are more specific to what you need to know.I can't say I recommend this book for anyone who already have other specific titles regarding photography.I should also mention that this book is for the elegant photographer. All the pictures are of super fancy weddings. Weddings that remind you of the early twenties. Just about everyone is dressed like characters in a play (I.E. men with top hats). It would have been nice just to see your normal everyday wedding photographs too."
4,The same old songs,"This out of print CD dates back to the earliest days of digital technology. It was okay for it's time, but it has since been replaced by collections with better sound quality. It has a good selection of The Four Tops hits, with the surprising ommision of ""7 Rooms of Gloom"". If you can find a cheap used copy of this, it may be worth picking up. Here is the track listing:1. Baby I Need Your Loving2. Ask the Lonely3. I Can't Help Myself4. It's the Same Old Song5. Something About You6. Shake Me, Wake Me7. Reach Out I'll Be There8. Standing in the Shadows of Love9. Bernadette10. Loving You is Sweeter Than Ever11. Walk Away Renee12. You Keep Running Away13. If I Were a Carpenter14. Yesterday's Dreams15. It's All in the Game16. Still Water17. Just Seven Numbers18. MacArthur Park19. Nature Planned It"
1,"Beware, the music is CRAP","Season one is okay, but beware Season 2 -- a very significant portion of the original music has been replaced with crap synthesizer music.Purchase at your own risk."
1,We've been had! Poorly Recorded,"The DVD Titled: The Fugitive purchased from this company, on good faith, was the worst copy we've ever seen. This was copied straight off of TV and there is a lot of snow and pixilation.At the bottom of the picture it had KTZZ station, which obviously means it was recorded in Seattle on a local station. Very poorly done!We wish that we could get a Full Refund in this matter!Things like this could give Amazon a bad name."
1,Then My Question Is ...,"If I purchase the complete box set, will I receive the updated DVDs with the correct sound track? Or do I run the risk of receiving old inventory with the audio issues previously mentioned?"
5,Very clever smart chick lit!,"Wendy Wasserstein has won Pulitzer prizes and it shows in this book! Of course it's ""just chick lit"" but still very well written, well thought out chick lit that's a cut above the rest in my opinion. It's not as good as the Sex and the City series - on tv, that is - but heading in that direction!"
5,A compelling read,"This compendium of short stories is a breeezy narrative on the wonders of life in the fabulous New York City. Whether it be a serious look at the state of the theater, or a discourse on her partnership with her cat, the late Wendy Wasserstein's writing will make the reader both smile and think."
3,"""Has to be heard to be believed"" -- Well, yes....","First, let me agree with those who find this disc enjoyable to listen to. It is. I don't fault the performances as such, and the compositions are wonderful, of course. However, I have to line up with the reviewer who called attention to the grossly obvious alterations to Schumann's Rhenish Symphony. There are performances out there that do quite well with the original orchestration, and while I won't deny that Leibowitz's genetically engineered version works in its own way, one wonders why a person would feel compelled to do it in the first place. My reaction is a bit like my feeling toward Thomas Beecham's goofball re-orchestration of Handel's Messiah: I can get into it, yes, but at the end of the day the original just has more appeal. So for a different take on Schumann, as kind of an enjoyable lark, I can endorse this disc -- but don't forget the actual source."
4,Worthwhile,"This is an interesting documentary of the life of Robert McNamara. I have used it for teaching a course in International Relations and American foreign policy to advanced high school students. My students love it, and it really gets them talking about issues like the use of nuclear weapons, choice of targets in war (military or civilian), war crimes, etc. If you are thinking of using it in class, check out the films official website ([...]) which includes lesson plans and lists of concepts that the film is useful for teaching."
4,Great documentary from a misunderstood figure in Cold War American History,Well put together peice! Enlightening perspective on the events that unfolded during the height of the Cold War.
5,A Study of a Human Being,What is facinating about McNamara is not that he is a saint nor that he is a devil but that he is only a human. All humans make mistakes but because McNamara was in a position of such great power the repercusstions of the mistakes led to the deaths of tens of thousands of inoccent lives.This is perhaps the reason for the pervaiding aura of sadness McNamara conveys in this film. It also accounts for his inibility to connect events in his life to those around him. He can understand the problem with fire bombing civilian targets in Japan but cannot fathom his own part in it.This is a facinating look into what happens when good men do bad things.
2,Disappointing and Superficial,"This is a disappointing attempt by Mr. McNamara to wax profound on his tenure as Secretary of Defense. The DVD does contain a few short but interesting comments about people like JFK and Castro; in general, though, it is a superficial treatment of history. I remember vividly everything about the Vietnam War and Mr. McNamara's prosecution of it; he was a true automaton who seemed to relish spouting facts and figures. He hasn't changed much. I don't know what he was attempting to do in this film other than to salve his conscience."
1,A war criminal remembers ...,"The old boy is a war criminal, remember that! The fog was in his head, when he helped to lie the USA into attacking a country that posed no threat to the USA or anyone else. (Sound familiar?)"
2,Not as great as it's cranked up to be,"I rented this movie because i had heard from many people that it was a fascinating insight into the life of a very important person of the last century. The movie, however, is mostly just McNamara justifying the horrendous things he and Curtis Lemae did in Japan and the things he did in Vietnam. This movie was billed as a movie that would make people think twice about war but Morris doesn't challenge McNamara at all the entire interview. McNamara even admits that he answered the question he wished he had been asked during press conferences instead of the one that had been asked and he certainly uses that tactic in the movie. I do not recommend this movie unless you want to hear someone justify firebombing Japan and carpetbombing Vietnam."
1,Pathetic attempt to atone for years of lying and war-crimes,"This guy was a lying rubber-stamping mouthpiece for one of the most despicable presidents and one of the most evil wars the U.S. has ever participated in. Now in his old age he wants absolution by apologizing and saying he made honest mistakes. There are millions of asians and 50,000+ U.S. soldiers now in their graves largely because of the behavior of this moron. Drunk with power, he intentionally, repeatedly, and knowingly lied to the American people for years. He and Ollie North should both be tried for treason instead of travelling on the talk show circuit."
1,"58,000 Dead - Amazon Won't Post My Review? Why?",Amazon is not posting my critical review about how the film whitewashes McNamara's complicity in JFK's & LBJ's business venture known as the Vietnam War. Nice censorship. Wonder if they will post this one.
2,The Fog of War - appropriate title for something McNamara,"Mr. McNamara, inarguably the worst secratary of defense in the history of the US, demonstrates perfectly that learning is not equal to wisdom.His many disasters, miscalculations and blunders helped make the Vietnam conflict into the mess that people & historians recollect today."
5,"President Bush, Heed His Advice","Although this documentary has nothing to do with the Bush administration, I find it very relevant to what is happening in the world today. It is basically a collection of interviews with Robert McNamara where he talks about the eleven lessons he learned from Vietnam and World War II. If only the Bush administration would heed his advice. Highly recommended."
4,Truth about War,"Although I was never ""in country,"" I was in the USN during the Viet Nam Conflict.I made two cruises to the South China Sea aboard the USS Ranger CVA-61, Aircraft Carrier.I also had friends that were killed and friends that were injured in Viet Nam.If you are willing to know the truth about war, including Viet Nam, watch this."
5,One of the best documentaries of all time,"Absolutely, one of the best documentaries of all time. If you are old enough to have lived duing his time in government, it is even more interesting hearing him reflect on the history of which he participated. And the 11 lessons he has learned in life are timeless. A truly great move."
5,"WHEN EVIL VS EVIL, WHO WINS?","Has there ever been a time when there was not a war somewhere on our planet? War lessons from the past can inform us with warnings and insight. But do we really learn anything?Documentarian Errol Morris deservedly won an Oscar for THE FOG OF WAR: ELEVEN LESSONS FROM THE LIFE OF ROBERT S. MCNAMARA. There's no fog in McNamara's startling, emotional, confessional rationalization of his life and involvement in the Vietnam strategy as Secretary of Defense under JFK and Lyndon Johnson. It is as chilling and riveting as anything I can think of. Everyone concerned about the globalization of religion and politics should see this searing film about the limited ability of humans to manage and contain threats to security and freedom. And there's the ever-present cold-blooded rationale to stop killing by killing in ever-more massive onslaughts. Question: Can you really confront evil with evil?"
5,Vietnam era remembered,"I had the opportunity to attend the premiere at Boston's Kennedy Library today for invited guests of Mr. Morris. Mr. McNamara was in attendance and took part in a question-&-answer session after the screening. As a college student at both UCalBerkeley and then at University of Wisconsin in the 1960's I lived through those most distressing times both for my generation and for my Country. This fast-moving documentary, at times difficult to watch given the emotional involvement we had with the subject during the 1960's, is superb! I came away feeling that I had not completely understood the role Mr. McNamara played during the Kennedy/Johnson administration or any sense of his humanity. It will be several days before I truly can compose my thoughts but this is a documentary that must be seen by anyone who lived through the Vietnam era or who wishes to learn from the mistakes made during those troubling times."
5,Re:Out of context and some dubbing detected,"I was hoping more would be discussed about the War on Terror and the world today, but other than that this is one of the best documentary's I've seen.In response to the ridiculous review review by Matthew W. Cero ""The Goalie"", it should be noted that the movie is ""clipped"" together because in the beginning of the movie, McNamara talks of hanging sentences and how if he pauses in mid sentence, he will just continue from where he left off.It should not suprise anyone that parts are ""clipped"" together because an 85 yr old pauses in mid sentenceAs for the claim that 100,000 dead civilians was dubbed in, he may not move his lips but he's sure moving his tongue. He didn't become a ventriloquist at 85!Some people need to wake up. This movie isn't for partisan hacks."
3,The Fog of War,"This DVD was supposed to arrive in 3-5 days, but it took over 3 weeks. So I couldn't give it as a Christmas gift. I will never buy from Amazon again."
2,Ramblings From the Nation's Worst Secretary of Defense,"After listening to the inept, revisionist McNamara ramble on in this film, one wonders what's next -- a documentary from Jimmy Carter on how to be a great president? Step one: create double-digit interest rates. Step two: stand impotent in the face of terrorists holding Americans hostage for 444 days in Tehran...What a shame America abandoned the people of South Vietnam, who were then steamrolled by the Soviet-backed North Vietnamese army, where millions of South Vietnamese were then murdered in communist ""re-education camps,"" or died while fleeing into the open sea in small boats to escape the communist onslaught from the North.The film gets two stars because it's at least instructive to observe the failed McNamara flailing about."
2,A note is not a book,"A rather confusing recollection of the Hitchcock notes about his most famous film. I miss a more ellaborate work by the author so this notes could be fully understood. Anyway there are some gems to those hungry for extras. For example, the transcript of the conversations between Tippi Hedren and Hitchcock while making The Birds. Interesting!"
4,THE MASTER OF SUSPENCE AND CINEMA,"""Hitchcock's Notebooks"" is a fascinatining book from page one right up to the end. The book goes to great depth and detail concerning Hitch's involvement with his films (giving examples from some of the more popular ones.It's very interesting for me, a Screenwriter (especially the chapter titled ""PREPARING THE SCREENPLAY""). In it, are treatments (outlines for screenplays), both script and scene revisions (hand-written and typed). This wonderful book even talks a little about Alma, Hitch's wife -- a screenwriter.So if you are as big a fan of Hitchcock as I am, don't just watch his movies, read this book. It's as close as you or I will ever get to learning about ""The Master of Suspence"" at work."
2,Interesting,"There were many interesting elements in this book, but at a whole not as informative or useful as I might have hoped. Maybe a good book for a Hitchcock collector who is trying to find everything out about Hitchcock..."
4,Essential for the Scholarly Enthusiast,"The author examines a selection of standard popular ballads, using Schenkerian analysis, a technique developed for analyzing the deeper structures of classical music and one very important in the field of musicology. This approach offers a new perspective on this beloved repertoire and reveals both its similarities to and differences from Western art music. The introductions to each analysis--offering general information--can be enjoyed by all; and the analyses themselves, while complex, are fascinating for the scholar. Altogether, this book helps instill a new respect for these popular song composers. Only partially appropriate for the general reader, this book is essential reading for those seeking a more scholarly approach to the topic."
2,Sad,"Madden 2000 offers the masses likely what they want...hype...and good graphics. What is missing here is what truly makes a football simulation worth its weight in gold...a powerful and versatile play editor. Nowhere to be found is anything like the old Dynamix Frontpage Sports Play Editor from the early 1990's which literally allowed you to program in your own plays as if they were your own children...instead you are left with pre-packaged rigid assignments that offer little in the way of creative freedom...yea the graphics are good, but a true fan of the game is far more concerned with the ability to create his own plays than whether players graphically mimick the absurd celebrations of the modern immature player and fan. Truly sad. Another example of the decline of taste of the consumer. Oh for a Windows version of the old Dynamix DOS Football Pro."
3,Typical EA,"Another year, another Madden. All eye candy, no artificial intellegence. The player ratings are useless!"
1,BIGGER IS NOT BETTER,"LOOK AT YOUR HAND. iS IT BIG? lOOK AT YOUR PINKY, THE TOP JOINT TO THE TIP. THATS ABOUT HOW BIG THESE PILLS ARE, AND AS ROUND, EXCEPT WITH ROUGH EDGES. I WOLF DOWN FOOD, BUT GET ONE OF THESE LODGED IN YOUR THROAT, NOT A PRETTY SIGHT."
1,Superior Amino Tablets(Optimum nutrition),This product is not a proper supplement of protein. It contains about the same amount of protein (20g) as a scoop of protein. The pills are HUGE and inconvenient. Essentially the tablet is protein powder compacted and into a pill with added carbohydrates to hold it together. Very disappointed in this purchase.
2,"good product, slow service","This is a grade A product, but the store I bought this product from is slow. I bought this item on a Saturday and it wasn't sent out till Wednesday. Not very happy, and most likely won't buy from them again since this is the second time this has happened."
5,Love Them,"My product arrived unopened and the price is great. I've been buying these from GNC for years, and Amazon offers a better deal. As for the product itself, amino acids are great immune boosters as well as muscle builders. The great thing about the pill, is that there is no protein to break down, so you get the amino acids directly to your system faster. It's great for long hikes or runs where you want to replenish your system ASAP while not consuming food. You can also grind the pills into a dust and mix in your water bottles/hydration packs."
4,good stuff,"This product will definitely help you get big. Maybe too big, but it depends on your goals. I found it to be very helpful before a workout but the only thing I dont like is the recommended dosage of 4 tablespoons 3-4x a day. It seemed a little too much for me and I felt too bulky. So i lowered my intake to twice a day. It's still great stuff though."
2,TO BIG,These Tablets are way to big. I am a big fan of Optimum. But this time they got it wrong. I almost choked trying to get these things down....Try there other products such as there protein powder is awesome....
1,It's not what you think,Doesn't work & I didn't experience anything it listed it would do. Waste of money & not satisfied at all
2,Never again.......,I still have tears in my eyes from choking on half a freaking pill. Never again will I take one of these. I couldn't swallow or spit it out. Any attempt I made to swallow would just scrape my throat untill I finally coughed it out.
1,Should have the ingredients listed on your amazon page.,There was no way I could get the list of the ingredients on this product before I bought it so took my chances.When it arrived I was really disappointed to see Whey on the list of ingredients because I am a vegan and I don't do dairy. So the stuff sits on my desk waiting for someone to come along and take it off my hands. What a waste of money. Show your ingredients on your amazon listing for heavens sake.
2,DONT DO IT!,"these things are twice as big as fish oil pills, and they are not even gel pills. i dont see how anyone could swallow it, to make it even worse the serving size is 2 pills! so im stuck biting 3-4 chunks outa this beast and then swallowing."
1,Deadly!,at least someone should have been killed by these tremendous gigantic pills. I almost choked trying to swallow the first pill of the bottle. I never have such a problem with 'soft gel' ones.
5,Love it!,"Reguardless of the size, these aminos are awesome! i was able to take 2 at a time, and they are truly great aminos, 5 star easy"
3,OUCH!,"OK, I did something really stupid. I actually bought these. The make up of the tabs is complete and fine, they are just HUUUGE! I take alot of different supplements and have no problem chugging down pills. THESE HURT! That's how big they are. For a brief moment I thought to myself as it lodged itself in my throat ""OMG, I'm an idiot and am going to choke to death"". I reared back and swallowed hard and it went down a little bit. I ate an sandwich and can still feel this thing at the base of my throat."
2,Waste of money,"This product is a huge waste of money for a few reasons. The pill is mostly whey powder, which is the same thing you drink after your workout. If you are looking to get a boost of all your amino acids, try to eat high protein meals. Like cottage cheese, meats, certain nuts. All high protein whole foods have all your amino acids that you need, and supplementing them with this is not worth it. Do some research, eat more wholesome meals less powders to have better gains."
2,Uncomfortable!,"I do a high protein whey shake during/after my workouts but I like to supplement this with a broad spectrum amino acid supplement. I normally like pills/supplements but these are just too large and, like others, have had a couple of very uncomfortable moments trying to swallow these giant pills. I will be switching to a Swanson product that is cheaper and comes in an easier to swallow size with comparable ingredients.GLTA."
5,A quality product,"Yes, these are huge pills, but not impossible to swallow. You do need a half a glass of water to swallow, but hydrating is vital to workout gains and this is a good habit to keep. I received exactly what I ordered. I do like this brand of Amino Acids and I would recommend these to anyone looking to maximize their workout gains. I am going to buy this product again when I run out."
2,"Huge pills, hard to swallow",I read tons of reviewers complaining about the size of the pill but I took the plunge anyways. Yea it's huge. I can swallow it whole but it's tough. I have to really concentrate. I cut it in halves but then the cut side was too pointy. Look for a different brand.
3,Cost not easier to swallow.,"The old version of this product came in the 325 tablet size. The new ""easier to swallow"" container comes in 320 size. The big issue is that now the serving size is two instead of one. This doubles the cost per a serving."
4,Vintage TV Delight!,"These early seasons of the Beverly Hillbillies and Petticoat Junction were great. 8 years later, it was a different story because the Hillbillies were still considered dumb and uneducated. These early shows were made at a time when they truly shined!"
2,"LOVE Hemi-Sync, but not this one",I found this particular CD distracting and annoying...and that was the ONLY thing I could focus on when it was playing! Alas! But this is the first Hemi-Sync that I have NOT liked.
1,Are they kidding?,"Don't bother getting this card. I don't have this particular card but I know it's already an old card. A G3 64 MB graphics card for three hundred bucks? The price is friggin ridiculous. There's now the new Geforce FX 5200 128 MB DDR Graphics card that costs around or under a hundred bucks, the Geforce FX 5600 256 MB DDR graphics at around a hundred-seventy bucks, or the ATI Radeon 9600 to 9700 pro 128 MB DDR that cost between a hundred-fifty to two hundred fifty bucks. You can look these cards up at pricewatchdotcom's page. This graphics card is old already and is not worth it if you want to play the latest games smoothly like the upcoming Half-Life 2, GTA: Vice City, Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield, IL-2: Forgotten Battles, and the upcoming Rome Total War."
5,Killer Graphics,"The graphics are super on this card.I also found it very easy to install.Yes,the price is high but well worth it!I like to play simulation type games so I know what good graphics are.Everything is so real,you feel like you are actually there."
2,"Not worth it as of October 24th, 2001","Right now, and from this day forward, it is absolutely pointless to get a GeForce 3... it is a great card, but even at amazon, the price is too high! How does Visiontec expect us to all be rich?! I here am not poor nor rich, so i have to choose a card that is good and has a good price! For this, i want the new ATI Radeon 8500. It has 4 times the processing power of a GeForce 3! It has outrun the GeForce 3 in every test it's been through! So dont waste your time with the GeForce 3. Get the ATI Radeon 8500 instead!"
3,A mild summer diversion,"Just another in that seemingly endless succession of so-so reads. Not bad, but not great. American ex-pat, now NZ cop investigates a serial murder, finds corruption in local politics -- imagine that! -- has brief sexual fling.Nothing truly outstanding, here. Competent enough writing. Not particularly mysterious mystery. Some contrived and pointless surprises. Disappointing resolution of Amanda's brief relationship with Debby.At best, a mildly diverting way to spend a few idle summer hours."
3,HUGE,"I am female, 5'6"", 140 pounds. Not ""tiny"", but not huge either. This bag is enormous. I am simply not wide enough for it. This bag sticks out even further than my chest! They should take a photo of someone wearing this monster for scale.Why are camera bags so ugly? Can't I be a pretty woman and have a giant camera AND wear a dress to a wedding? I thought this would be better than my gray backpack. But really, I am better off with the ugly backpack, that I just leave on my seat. If I need batteries or memory, I just go back to my seat.A bigger person, literally, might be OK with this bag. Honestly, when you see it on me you wonder how I remain upright. I would think you need to be maybe 6 foot, 200 pounds to wear this without looking freakish."
2,ALright I guess,This movie is focuing towards a harm hearted godzilla.This the movie introdue minya the retarded son of godzilla who blows smokes instead of a fire blast or sort.Mainly it focus on the minya and his adventures running off but really the end its pretty cool when they team up and destroy Kumonga ( a Big Oh Spider).
3,Better than you think.,"This movie is a step up from.""Godzilla's Revenge"" Which clearlyuses stock footage from ""Godzilla's Son"" My vote for the worse Zilla is the ""Terror of Mecagodzilla""It's even worse than 'Smog Monster'Which is lame."
3,Son of Godzilla is cheesy but still fun to watch,Some scientists' experiment goes all wrong and mantises and a spider are made gigantic. The mantises then unearth an egg and out hatches a hideous thing that looks like a talking piece of shit. Then we find out it's really Godzilla's son when a character mentions how it looks like a baby Godzilla. Then daddy comes to the rescue and he isn't happy. He kicks the mantises asses. The baby Godzilla grows into a toddler Godzilla who looks like the pillsbury dow boy. Father and son have many more adventures together.
4,very awesome service,"The order on the specific date it promised. The order was intact...no cuts, no damages. My husband enjoyed his gift and we enjoyed watching it. Thansk!"
1,Godzilla or Monster version of Mr Mom,As bad as people think Godzilla's Revenge is its better to get that then this since it contains all the fight scenes from this movie and Godzilla versus the Sea monster. Plus the extra fights with Gaborah. This is a monster version of Mr Mom..What were they drinking too much SAKI?
3,"Great Picture Quality, Re-Dubbed Audio",The picture quality is excellent on this DVD but the audio is not the original audio tracksfrom the original released movie. So if you are a Godzilla fan you may be disappointed by the re-dubbing of the monster movie classic.
3,Minilla isn't all bad! At least it's better than Barney!,"This movie weighs in as yet another South Seas fantasy yarn. Very low bloodshed, light-hearted subject matter. The locations are great on this film. The acting is good, not spectacular, but both consistent and entertaining. Unlike some of the other Godzilla yarns, the monsters here are very plausible and natural. In the science fiction world, heat and radiation can enlarge just about anything. A few of the Godzilla/Minilla scene to feel more suited for ""Barney goes back to his roots"" but Minilla makes a good dramatic focus for the film. ""Son of Godzilla"" reveals another side of Godzilla, that of a parent. This concept seems to hold some favor with the Japanese, as it is repeated through several other films."
2,Daddy G can only hope his son will change in later life.,"Though this film starts off very promising (a second godzilla rumoured, a reporter on an island where sinister experiments are going on, a glimpsed giant mantis), things go swiftly into the mire as soon as the ludicrous, horrifyingly twee Godzilla Jnr shows up to indulge in stupid, unfunny rock-throwing contests and battle the most unconvincing giant spider ever come across. Presumably this is aimed at younger viewers (that old excuse for making a duff film rearing its ugly head again), but when I saw this film as a youngster I was completely bored by the lifeless slow-moving 'plot' and thought the special effects nothing short of laughable. This film only gets two stars because it's better than that dire 1998 Godzilla re-make. See 'Destroy All Monsters' or 'Godzilla Vs Ghidorah' instead."
2,Okay,"This one's pretty good. Gimantis and Spiga were pretty cool, as was Minya and Godzilla. Another thing I liked about the movie was the weather control thing. That was pretty cool. But other than that, this movies kinda a bummer. Cool monsters and ideas, but everything else kinda sucks. If I could, I'd give it 2.5"
3,It's an okay movie,"this movie was one of G's worst movies, but since it is a G' movie it is better than most other movies out there, good for a die-hard G' fan who also likes to have some comedy in with there action, like Deep Rising. anyway i would recomend this movie as a starter for a Godzilla collection of any size, or, variety."
5,My third Favorite Godzilla Film (that I've seen)!!!!,"In this movie, Japan now has a new threat. Baby Godzilla! Minilla (baby G) really doesn't hurt anyone. In this movie Godzilla has a son and tries to teach him how to fight a giant praying mantis called Kamacurus. Minilla also fights Kumonga. I love this movie!!!!!"
2,Make room for Daddy.,"Another disappointment from Jun Fukuda. Though tis film has a decent plot and some good effects, Spiega and the Gimantises, it still falls far short of previous entries in the series. The Godzilla design is particularly bad, looking nothing like the awe inspiring creature of old. Minya is a creature that should not have made it off the drawing boards. His childish antics degrade the film and have been known to cause viewers to experience an uncontrollable retching sensation. Though it has its defenders, SOG is not one of The Big G's best adventures."
3,Deformed Godzilla!,"This is all in all a pretty sad movie that lacks in both acting and effects. Minya (Godzilla's son) is only entertaining to 5 year olds and the Godzilla suit is way too big for the actor to fit into... and it shows! Half the time he's losing his balance and looks more like a giant toad. Toho wanted to make Godzilla resemble his son (wouln't have been more refreshing to make Minya resemble Godzilla?). Unlike the Godzilla film, this one is just for the real little tikes (this was around the time where Godzilla was falling into Gamera's habits... saving people, being all nice nice to his son, ect). The only good thing is Godzilla's battle with a giant spider and prying mantis which are both trying to eat Minya's egg. All the best fight scenes in this movie ( in stock footage form ) can be seen in ""Godzilla's Revenge"", wich in my opinion is alot better."
2,Here comes Junior!,"Summary: Godzilla and Son versus giant insects on a remote island.So-so Godzilla film featuring the first appearance of Godzilla's ""son"", Minya. Although childish (even for a Godzilla film), the movie is not entirely without merit.Next is ""Destroy All Monsters""."
3,This is one of the cuter Godzilla movie's.,First of all Baby Godzilla looks like a Marsh Mellow Puff Man. You know what that means! CORNY! How'd that guy live though the storm anyways? But still I have to give it a three because it is wicked funny.
5,Spicy and Warm,This is the first cologne I have ever paid attention to....It is definetly a warm and spicy fragrance with a soft amber musk for a finish..... yummy!
1,dunlhill desire,There looks like greeting to me that they were wrong in package that they me sent if the article says 1.7 ounce not 0.17onza that was the one that they me sent for mistake to check.
1,Poorly Made Product,"If you're looking for a multi-layer disc to be used with your grinder, this is not the product for you. I purchased it looking for something to facilitate removing paint from the siding on my house. After making it through 3 boards, the disc quit functioning (and temporarilly dissabled my grinder). Unlike quality discs, these are made of a weak backing material that won't hold up against any type of use. Not only did the disk rip off its mounting system (not quite what the company makes it up to be), the fiberglass backing of the flap disc split. I didn't even use is long enough to wear the abrasive off. Of the four types of sanding disc I've used this is denfinitely the poorest quaility of any of them. Go to a local hardware store, or buy any other brand than this one if your looking for a lasting product."
5,A Man for Others: Maximilian Kolbe,This is one of the most touching books I have ever read. It is amazing the way St Maximilian's love and faith are portrayed. I will be reading it again and again.
4,a generally well done set of little essays...,"though often they seemed to me to display a keen grasp of the obvious. I liked the first couple of essays the best: these focused on the theological ""big picture"" emphasizing that ancient Jews were more aware than many moderns of God's bigness and humans' own smallness, and describing the soul as God's ""double agent"" within us (i.e. the part of us most connected to the Divine)."
2,Questionable Translation,"The best part of the book is the discussion of the problems inBible translation and the need to be sensitive to Biblical idiom.As to the Bible translation itself, I focus most significantly on the problems in the Song of Solomon. Here, the author concedes that he flagrantly deviates from the text on the ground that no one (e.g. himself) understands the poet's motives in choice of words. This is absurd Bible translation. Indeedin just several verses of the poem, I discovered no less thantwenty serious errors."
4,Swift's Stringed Instruments,This piece is a nice addition to the houses that I already have. I am amazed at how quickly it arrived.
5,Great Extention Cable,I needed to place an additional monitor a short distance from my computer for instructional purposes. This cable did the trick. I my have been better off getting a male to male connection but this fills the bill well. Slightly pricey.
4,Well-built cable,The StarTech 15-foot cable is a quality product. I used it to extend my computer's digital DVI output to a flat-screen TV by coupling this cable with a DVI-D to HDMI cable. Well worth the price.
3,Rather let down...,"After reading a number of positive reviews that this weather vane did its job well, I was quite hopeful. Unfortunately, ours is basically ornamental.When first being installed, the metal broke on the directional pieces, so S/N wouldn't attach to the body. With proof of purchase, Whitehall DID send a replacement part. A few weeks ago, the remaining part was attached to the weathervane, but windy country weather doesn't really budge the directional arrows.The 3 rating is to give props to Whitehall for replacing a broken part."
1,Nothing here,"This book is less than speculation. The flashpoints of the future cannot be recognized from our current perspective. Throughout human history watershed events are completely unforseen because our frames of reference are always based on current circumstances. Statistically, all human behaviors are quite predictable, thus stable. Financial cataclysm? No way! The stock market is extremely predictable and stable if we shed our contemporary goggles that blind us from the truth. This book is hogwash."
1,"Accident or Design ?, the Author Misleads, Trust NO One !","This book is very suspect and stinks of mind control. When one looks to the future you have to look back and who,but the Illuminati have been controlling the world thru wars,diseases and depressions. The same holds true for the future unless the sheeple wake up and follow the money trail to the manipulators and expose their grand scheme. Who are the Illuminati you ask ? Nobody really, you'll meet them soon enough when they introduce us to the aliens. Buckle Up !"
3,A Solid Effort!,"Eugene Linden explains that most of civilization's history has included long periods of remarkable stability, including the last few decades. However, stability is not the norm and indications show it is ending. Thanks to overpopulation, technological change and environmental degradation, profound instability is likely in this century. The clues to future instability are in plain sight. You can see them when you compare what has happened in the past to what is likely to happen in the future.In the first half of this book, Linden makes a persuasive case for some of his basic predictions, though he is definitely a pessimist. The scenarios in the second half of the book, intended to illustrate what will happen if these predictions come true, are really speculative fiction masquerading as futurology. Still, Linden's basic premise is sound and his warnings should be taken seriously. We... recommend the book to those involved in long-range business planning and trend research."
5,Linden fills an important place in the public debate,"At a time when our leaders all too often take credit where none is due and place blame on those least deserving, it is refreshing to be reminded that much of fate lies beyond our control. The true test of character and leadership is in responding to the unknown. A must read for those looking for a fresh perspective on the inevitable human question of what does the future hold."
3,A book that will help you visualize,"This book provides a good description of the tabernacle of the Hebrews and its corresponding services. Where this book will help Biblical readers is that the descriptions along with the sketches provided allow the reader to visualize the structure as opposed to just reading the words. I will be able to read Leviticus much easier the next time through. For the Christian, the author makes applicable connections between Christ and his ministry and the tabernacle and its services. For instance, an example I thought revealing was that the silver sockets were formed from redemption money and its associated references become more vivid. This book is marketed as a supplemental to Alfred Edersheim's The temple: Its minisry and services. Many parallel are drawn between the temple and the New Testament. This book will remain a classical reading into the foreseeable future."
2,Not as enjoyable as expected...,"As a fan of trivia games, I was quite disapointed with this one. I had two main problems. The first was the questions were too easy. With the multiple choice format, even with the hard questions it was easy to pick out the right answer. My biggest complaint was the second time I ever played the game, it started to repeat some questions. That happening after only two games in unacceptable!!Anyways, if you are looking for a more enjoyable trivia game, I feel Jeopardy! is superior."
4,Fun!,Fun for the entire family! Entertaining; educational; inviting; great choice for family game night! I would recommend to others families and groups of all ages!
4,Excellent Product - Prompt Shipping,"Game was delivered promptly and in great condition. Fun game for groups, but took a little while to figure out. I would recommend this game to any trivia game enthusiast."
3,Not that Great,"My husband and I bought this game about 2 months ago and have only played it one time.I really did not enjoy the format or the questions.It is boring and long(or maybe it just seems long because it is boring)!There is a setting for a faster game and it is a little better,but I reccomend Jeopardy over this game anyday.Also you can get it for a lot better price,just look around."
3,HIT ME,"Martha (Rosanna Arquette) is a fake medium. Her dad Walter(Jason Robards) acts as her manager. Walter likes his drink and Martha likes hotel clerks. They travel to small congregations putting on a show. During one of the shows, Martha starts to get real contacts except the person isn't dead...yet. Things flare up as Martha predicts more and more deaths. My main problem with the film is that they should have ran with this more, i.e. added one or two more shows before the ending. Tom Hulce plays a skeptical reporter following Martha around. Good acting, good drama.F-bomb, brief sex, brief nudity (Rosanna Arquette)"
3,"The movie started filming in Charlotte, Nc in 1989","The movie was filmed in Charlotte, Nc in 1989. I have never watched the whole movie. I never heard of it making it to the theathers and don't know why it didn't. I heard it flopped, some above seem to like it. I bought it for my daughter because her mother who passed away in 2002 is an extra in several parts of the film. One really close up full face wearing a big hat. Our Children & Grand Children miss you Lavette."
2,Black Rainbow DVD,"Black Rainbow is a very well-made psychological thriller with fine performances; however, the quality of the DVD picture is rather poor, hence my two-star rating. This film deserves a high-quality film-to-DVD transfer."
2,GREAT QUALITY PRODUCT,"PRODUCT: Game was BRAND NEW and still in its factory seal. Shipping was very fast and the price was great. I could not be happier with the seller and the transaction, I plan on getting more games from them in the future.GAMEPLAY: For those that loved Virtual-On Oratorio Tangram, this game does not do justice to it. There are not as many special attacks and controlling the virtuaroids is not as smooth. However, it does have the option of two player virtuaroids (so it is like a team battle) which I have not played in any of the other ones."
3,Alittle Dissapointed,"I have been a fan of the series since I was about 9 years old. I finaly got a PS3 that could play PS2 games, so I thought I would give this a try and to my dissmay, it was no where near as good as the Dreamcast predicessor. The game feels sluggish and unatural. The good news is that sega tried to encoperate a story mode however it makes the game worse. The best feature in this game would be all the virtoids you could pick but it dosent make this game that much enjoyable. Unless your a fan of the series or have money to throw away, I would stay a way from this one."
4,Very good Blaze book,I have read a dozen or so Blaze books and I thought this was one of the better ones. It had a good story and characters you could really care about. I will probably check out more of Miranda Lee's books.
2,A fun project...but cheaper just buying a small IM machine!,"A quick read and definitely enjoyable in knowing how ""possible"" it is to make your own 1/2 oz. injection molding machine. Only major problem... You need a few tools; probably a bandsaw, welding equipment, a good drill press and most likely a lathe. But then again, if you want to make some molds for the IM machine you probably already have the tools I listed! The point is, it's a good learning project, but you're better off buying your own small IM machine for a few hundred bucks..."
3,For the Enivornmentalist Handyman,"at 120+ pages, Secrets of building a plastic injection molding machine, is a pretty quick read. I haven't gotten around to trying to build such a device yet, cause honestly I've never built anything before..a few words though. The deivce once built works with strips of plastics you've collected from old recyclables around the house.. soda bottles, etc.. which is pretty cool.the machine itself however consists of about 6 pages, of which 80 % is screws and bolts and washers.. The back of the books has a very small list of possible suppliers for some of the more unique parts, and it looks like the machine itself will take abour roughly 100 bucks to make, give or take a little.So if you've already built a few things then by all means this is gonna be a good time for you, to expand what you can do.if you haven't touched a screw driver lately, you might want to start somewhere else..."
2,"Good read, but has anyone built it?","The book is a well constructed account of how to build a bottom-rung plastic injector, and may be useful to anyone who wants to understand the workings of such a thing from a hands-on perspective. But I must agree with another reviewer that the device appears to have no practical value at all. What items can you really make with a device that takes appreciable effort and cost to build, and can't produce anything that weighs more than half an ounce? The only example the author has provided is to make a control knob for the machine's height adjustment. Perhaps anyone who has built this device and found it worthwhile could provide their own comments to counter this, but until then, I can only recommend the book as a quick ground-level read on injector background."
1,Not worth it.,"For as interesting as the promo describes this book, it is a very nothing book. You soon realize that the device the author built has absolutely no practical purpose other than to form the basis for the book."
2,Could have just used man iostat/sar/vmsat/ps,"Let me start off by saying that this book is not really bad. It doesnt really give any wrong information, it is organized in fairly nice fashion, and for beginners its probably a great place to start. The title is a little misleading though. It doesnt really give a bit of advice on how to optimize Linux performance. It is merely a beginners language version of the man page for tools.I was expecting something that would explain how to resolve thrashing or cpu usage issues, not simply give me a rundown on the tools that can find those situations. I found the cause, now what? This book doesnt help answer that question at all."
4,Solid book,"This is a great book for isolating and resolving performance problems on a single host. I wish the author would have spent less time on graphical tools, and more on multi-system/inter-system performance tuning."
3,Good but okay,"Good book. However it just skims through the tools you can use to check/analyze performance, but not enough details on completion of the analysis. Lots of places they just show how to start the analysis but does not go any further on how to determine the cause. We all know the tools to be used but they will only be good if it can yield the cause of performance. This book does not carry you that far."
2,"Two Stars, One word:Lagg","This is a nice little video card, NO matter what game I play in I experienece too much lagg, its too slow ... Its good for 2d games, thats it. And for the early 3d games. I tried the unreal II demo with it and it ran pretty slow. I wasnt satisfied. I also have a geforce 3, and it runs much smoother. THis is a not worth it video card unless your a light gamer or student comp type user. I really dont think its a good video card. and I can tell you 4 more words about buying this vid card:It aint worth it.Take my advice!"
2,"No fan on GPU, small overheat issue","This card comes with SDR (slow memory) not good for overclockin.ATI 7500 much better deal, for same price that includes DDR memory.Overall is not a bad card, but slow for games!"
4,So far so good,"So far it has worked well. I also have a Hercules 3D Prophet 3, which is still the best GeForce 3 card on the market. This GeForce 2 doesn't perform like the GeForce 3, but it works just fine for every game I've played with it. Good card for the money."
5,This is a Terrific Book,"I just bought a new book that all of us should have. The author,Jane Harper, has included things that we usually find out how to doonly after we've done it wrong. If you are a new club officer oryou're looking for guidance on how a meeting should be run,this book is a must."
4,Brings Back Memories,I saw this group perform and give their testimony back in the late 80s/early 90s. This is one group I've always recalled with fond memories. I had this album as a cassette and had their testimony cassette too. There are things they told about that still make me ponder faith and the state of religion here in the US.
5,Changed my life,"Got saved at one of their concerts on July 4, 1990. Been looking for their album for a long time. Finally found it on a file share site."
2,Kind Of Boring,"This game plays like Streets of Rage, it is a side scroller and you just walk around fighting whomever comes at you in each level. Then you fight the Boss at the end of the level and move on"
5,Shrek: Reekin Havoc! Awesome old school GBA game!,Hello I'm an autistic adult gamer...Shrek what can I say? Awesome GBA game play's like some DBZ games with the fighting but that's cool because that's what I get into DBZ and Shrek games. The graphic's are excellent in the game the character's kind of remind me of bobble heads. Who ever created this game had a good sense of humor with designing the character's. Besides from that an excellent shrek game. It also has a cute little storyline too although more fighting than anything else from what I noticed. I would recommend this game for anyone who loves shrek. Get this shrek game you'll really enjoy it.
3,Rand Mcnally 2006 Greater Cincinnati Street Guide,"This is a map book with a spiral binder. There was a CD to be included but it did not come. See the ad which prominently displays the CD as being included. If RM will send me the CD that would be appreciated and they earn another star in the ratings. Book is standard map fare, readable and generally understandable."
5,A Very Helpful Offering,This book really helped me to understand the science of devotional service to Krishna as taught by Srila Rupa Goswami. I read it alongside Nectar of Devotion by AC Bhaktivedanta Swami (also available on amazon.com) and finally I can say I've been able to grasp a little of the deep subject elaborated upon in this book. Much gratitude to His Holiness Dhanurdhara Swami for this outstanding offering.
5,Its so cute!,"I ordered this toy off of Amazon and i love him! He's so soft and cute! He's very durable and great to snuggle with! He's a perfect size for toddlers and littler kids to carry around. And again, he's so cute!!! I would highly recommend this stuffed animal."
5,the best,"By the 2nd season, this series had really hit its stride. Jansen was perfect for this role and many guest stars were clamoring to get in on all the fun."
3,"I'll Buy This Item, But Only.....","I'll buy this item, but only if that awful musical travesty that totally ruined ""The Fugitive Season Two Volume One"" is gone and the original incredible musical score remains. I reserve the right to come back and raise or lower the stars in this review depending on the final product. It's up to you, CBS/Paramount. (As a note of caution, I would recommend against purchasing this DVD set until the reviews are in.)"
3,"Great series, but fix the music","I have always been a fan of this series, and I have purchased the discs for the first two seasons. However, I was under the impression that with the Volume Two disc, the cheesy synthesizer musical segments had been eliminated. Indeed, much of the music of the original series has been restored, but there are still sections of individual episodes that feature synthesizer passages."
1,"Yep, it's the music","I bought Vol. 1, and would pay immediately for the rest of the series, but for one thing: the problem with the music has not been handled to anyone's satisfaction. For now, I'll stick to VHS converted to DVD, and that's a shame. Please try and get it right, CBS."
3,Quit All The Complaining,"No one wants to see changes to the music of any show from what originally aired, but if the producers of the DVDs could have given us exactly what we wanted, they would have. It has to be costly and time-consuming to change music in the ques. Enjoy the show for what it is -- one of the best TV dramas of all time -- and be glad that someone has released the show in a professional, viewable fashion, not via some bootleg copies from people who had their VCRs cranked up 10 years ago. Quit all the complaining and praise the producers, not criticize them, so we can get the two remaining seasons of the show, whether musically perfect or not."
3,Remember New Coke priming the pump for the return of Coke Classic ??,"Don't be surprised if this music debacle laid onto one of the best episodic TV dramas of all-time isn't just a marketing ploy. When CBS does release The ""Classic"" Fugitive, the faithful will gobble up the originals, too. These guys at CBS slip out of the noose more times than Fred Johnson."
4,Great show properly released ?,"This great show, my all time favorite, appears to be headed our way with the great music we argued for. This is great news as the writing, acting, production values, and music contributed to the greatness of the show. The show was greatly harmed with the music changed.Now, we can hope that the rest of the series is released as soon as possible.Thank you to the fans for demanding the series in its correct form and thank you CBS/Paramount for fixing the problem.Bring them on!Steve LecherApril 3, 2009 update:I hate to report that music is still an issue. They even changed the merry-go-round music on Brass Ring. They couldn't get the rights to the original music? Come on. Why they can't do this series justice is beyond me. It' sad."
1,This Is a Paramount Rip-Off,"As a fan of this wonderful TV show, one very important and major component of the series was the outstanding music specifically written and masterly matched with each scene. For Paramount to take such short-cuts to ""save money"" and take out the original music is in my eyes, totally unforgivable. Under NO circumstance, will I buy a single DVD of THE FUGITIVE with altered music. The music is equally instrumental in making the series a classic as the writing, directing and photography. The fans got the shaft, we should return the favor and give it right back to Paramount by refusing to buy their product and hit them where it counts, in the pocket book."
1,"If music is like the last set, I will reject this one",I will wait to hear what was done in terms of the music on this set. If the same situation that destroyed the enjoyability of the last set is found in this set I will not buy it at any price. I suspect that the same problem will be found since no announcement has been made the contrary.
5,"the fugitive season 2 , replacement and vol 2","I HAVE NOT VIEWED THIS VOLUME, BUT HAVE VIEWED VOLUME1 SEASON 2 REPLACEMENT. FOR MANY WHO PURCHASED THE ORIGINAL IN STORES BEFORE THE REPLACEMENT PROGRAM THE NEW VERSION IS BETTER HAS THE ORIGINAL MUSIC. I DID HAVE PROBLEMS GETTING THE REPLACEMENT. THEY DID NOT SUPPLY A PHONE NO OR ADDRESS TO REACH THEM, BUT I GOT IT AFTER IT WAS SENT TO ME. FOR THOUGHTS WHO PUT A POBOX INSTEAD OF A STREET ADDRESS WHICH I DID. THEY ONLY ACCEPT A STREET ADDRESS ON THE FORM AND IT'S IN PRINT YOU NEED A MAGNIFYING GLASS TO READ. CALL THEM IF YOU DID WHAT I DID OR E-MAIL THEM. DIRECT CONTACT: PHE MARKETING 1(661)702-5000 VALENCIA,CALIF BEFORE SEPTEMBER 2009. THE DVD AMAZON SENT CAME IN 2-3 DAYS IN GOOD CONDITION I AM FINISHING MY REPLACEMENT BEFORE VIEWING IT. GREAT SHOW !! GET IT!!"
1,Probably still sux,"I read today that Seaon 3 volume 1 will be released soon. I seriously doubt the music problem will be fixed. In fact, would not be surprised if the entire run of the show is released in this bastardized format. Too bad - only hope is that someday a GOOD company that cares about the product it's releasing (like Image Entertainment) will release the show in its original broadcast form."
2,"The Fugitve Season 3, Vol. 1 Coming Soon: Leave It Alone, CBS!!","One should keep in mind that, CBS is most likely still selling the re-scored DVD copies of Season 2, Vol. 1 in stores, and are ONLY creating enough replacement discs for those who take the effort to mail in a request for one, or actually just burning replacement copies PER mailed-in request!!So I had assumed that Season 2, Vol. 2 would end up the way it is, since the composers that CBS hired had obviously re-scored the entire season before-hand, and CBS would simply sprinkle back in a few original cues for each episode, just enough to appease caring fans and quiet the complaints (IT DIDN'T WORK!!), while keeping the costs of restoring all of the original cues to a minimum, for MASS distribution of the DVDs.However, Season 3 Vol. 1 is scheduled for release on October 27, 2009, and all I can say to CBS is: DON'T MESS WITH THE ORIGINAL CUES, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE ANY MORE BUSINESS!!"
2,Music is still screwed up!,"The Fugitive: Season Two, Vol. 2I bought this thinking that they corrected the music problem, but in the very first episode you can tell right away that it's not the original music. The first episode has many scenes with a carousel. Instead of a calliope sound, you hear and overbearing carnival song that sounds like it was made on a radio shack keyboard with electronic drums. It is mixed so loud that it is distracting.The whole DVD release of The Fugitive is full of this awfulness. I honestly think the only original music is the Theme itself.I give the DVD two stars only because it is one of the best TV shows ever made. What CBS did to the music ruined it. In some other shows it may not make a difference, but the music in the original Fugitive was very important to the show.I guess they figured that no one would remember the music. It is a shame."
5,"Outstanding image quality, incredible black levels","This Pioneer 42"" HDTV plasma monitor (42A3HD) has outstanding quality, even when you play regular DVDs back on this. It's at its best when you have HDTV content, such as HD cable. I can't wait to get the Toshiba HD DVD player when it comes out in March and get a few HD DVD movies to watch on this Pioneer. The images on this plasma are crytal clear, and the black levels (i.e., shades) are just incredible. Don't settle for a lesser brand. Magazines like PC World and Consumer Report rank Pioneer and Panasonic and Fujitsu (harder to find) as the best. The only (minor and common to all plasmas) drawback is power consumption, but the picture quality is just fantastic."
3,Pay attention to the specs,"The specs on the Amazon site appear great, with features like ""3:3 pulldown at 72 Hz"". Go to the Pioneer site and download the detailed specs and you'll see that this TV doesn't have that feature, and several others, touted here."
5,John Cale meets the P-Furs?,"Being a newly inducted fan to a band that deserves so much more than they seem to have gotten, I have to toss my hat into their ring. I continue to get a late post- Velvets vibe on repeated listening....I hear John Cale channeled via the Psychedelic Furs. There is a darkness at work and an almost visceral sense of abandonment/loneliness/emptiness in the slower numbers while the more upbeat tunes show glimmers of sunlight lining the edges of the clouds......great work"
4,It's good.........really good.,"How best to describe Brooklyn quintet The National's music? Alt Country? Americana? Alternative Rock? or just good old straight-up guitar driven rock 'n' roll. Is that shades of Wilco, Tindersticks, The Doors, Willard Grant Conspiracy and Luna I hear?To be honest I'm not entirely sure how to classify the sound coming forth from my speakers other than to say that their new album Alligator is categorically, uniformly superb.This is music better experienced than defined, so I won't wax lyrical about it's many virtues other than to say if you consider yourself an adventurous music listener, Alligator will repay your curiosity in spades."
3,Pretty good but not as great as everyone says,"It's a good album, with some decent songs (the first two are standouts). But the middle part (like many National albums) drags a bit. Overall still a decent buy."
1,This basement is full of idiots,"If by alligator you mean shell-shocked bacon strip of a reptile writhing lazily in a puddle, then yes, of course. It would have been nice if the studio manager had gotten some protein shakes into these fellows before they started recording. Yawn et cetera. Gawd, I feel like I'm back in Latin 101, lorded over by Bobo the Inneffective, his voice a loutish baritone, hairs filling every orifice and pore, forehead slathered in sweat, brow hairs pointing downward in an accusatory manner.Let me ask you a question: Do you like the idea of that guy who does the annoying voiceovers for car commercials fronting a band making music with what sound like Tonka toys? Matt Berninger makes the dude from Crash Test Dumbasses sound like the Velvet Frog. Is that McBrianEno wheezing in the background? Ben & Jerry hang-gliding and popping horse tranks, colostomy bags flapping in the breeze like hyperactive moths bathed in bulbs."
2,Book returned,"This book might include good recipes but it spends too much time talking about fish in general and it has almost no pictures (I really need to see how the finished dish should look in order to understand whether I did a good job). Plus, the size of the book it just too big. It looks like an encyclopedia volume...not really the appropriate size to use in the kitchen. I Ended up returning it."
4,Great for the professional or home cook!,Very good step by step instructions with pictures. Anyone who wants a little more info on fish should read this.
5,Simply the best,Already followed several receipes Singapore Chile Crab etc.Well only the plates left.Fantastic simple and easy to follow.I started cooking from the age of tweleve in my dada and uncles chinese restaurentsthey did the crabs exactly the same.I felt like deja vu
1,Extraordinary Times Extraordinary Beings,"Although fairly well written, I felt uneasy about this book. Maitreya seems to coerce Wayne Peterson. The message is do this or these are the consequences such as the tree crashing across the street in Washington, D.C. when Peterson questioned Maitreya. True spiritual Beings of the Light give information when asked but do not cajole nor chastise if the person does not follow through nor promise to reward them if followed through. Our God given free will be respected even when we do not follow the guidance. Then we take whatever consequences, but the spiritual Being of the Light does not punish us with ""magical"" acts.Therefore I cannot recommend this book."
5,A vision of the future,"What a thrilling book. Full of adventure, miracles, inspiration and a vision of the future. This book just might change many lives."
3,Good unit for the price ... mileage may vary!,"I've enjoyed this unit and just bought my 2nd after the first one died ... lasted about 1 1/2 yrs. Other reviews indicate that these units seem to die after some time and I've read it's related to a power capacitor (probably an easy fix for someone skilled in electronics). Other problems are that some DVD-Rs won't load in this ... seems really arbitrary though, not any specific brand. I like it to play .avi files from the computer. If I were just playing store bought DVDs, I think I would choose something a little more reliable. I bought my second one from a retailer that offers a 4 year extended warranty for $20. I figure the extra money is worth it as 4 out of the 5 DVD players I've owned have died within 3 years. So my advice ... make sure you have a good warranty and expect to replace it, enjoy it while it works."
2,Remanufactured Phillips 642,Worked well for 30 days and then started having problems turning on. Really a pain. Won't turn on normally and have to spend 10 min. or so pushing the stand-by button to get it go on. Don't be a remanufactured one.
4,Sweet Divx!,"Great little Divx player with progressive scan. Component outputs provide great digital signal and optical output provides digital sound. Divx has been great as we can watch movie files from camcorders and cameras without reformatting to DVDs. Would recommend. Also very thin and has great form factor to fit into tight spots if needed.Cons: No HDMI/DVI output, but for this price, nothing does... yet."
2,Remanufactured DVP642,"Great valued unit - but buy it new. Bought a remanufactured unit as a second DVD/DivX player - died on me just after the 90 day warranty ended (No Disc error for DVDs, plays CDs fine). Meanwhile, my original non-remanufactured unit is still working fine after a year and a half."
3,Good and nice,"Fast shipping, great condition. Nice size. Works very good... , but sometimes the sound jumps... but overall OK."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"This DVD player never operated at a very high level, but then you get what you pay for. At the original price of approximately $40, this player ""worked"" for a year and a half but there were always problems with it such as stopping and starting during movies, freezing up entirely, failing to recognize that there was a disc in the tray to read, the tray refusing to open... I was pretty shocked since Philips makes quality products. It wouldn't have been so bad if I'd have gotten a year and a half of great play, but no such luck! Don't buy this model - upgrade!"
2,Limited File Support and Very bad Remote and Interface,"It has a terrible remote control, its's small and cheap. You have to hold the stop button to eject a disc. My unit will only play files with the extensions MPG and Divx but will not play any AVI Files.It's fussy about which discs it will or will not play and it's becoming more so with time. It's limited to only 8 characters for filenames and has a very primitive interface for Divx and MP3 playback.You Get What You Pay ForM. Calcagno"
1,Dead upon arrival. Amazon refused to take it bak.,"I ordered two Philips DVP642 DivX (refurbished) from Amazon. Both dvd player were pack in a generic brown box. There were no manufacture label or anything outside the box except UPS shipping label. The dvd player were wrap in buble wrap only. Because the boxes were just generic brown box, I threw away the box immediately. Couple days after I threw away the boxes, I start to install the dvd play and test it out. One of them was defected upon arrival. The player would play for about 1 minute, then I get a blue screen with ""Disc Loading"" forever. This happen no matter what I did. I try to unplug, try several other dvd disc. Nothing work. I called Amazon, they said they won't take it back without the box. All I can say is SUCK."
2,"Love the tip, wish it cut","The tip of the scissors is a wonderful safety addition. Unfortunately, the rest of the items isn't terrific. The scissor action overlaps whenever the blades are brought together. It's not very sharp where it should be sharp but it's perfect for where it isn't supposed to be sharp - the tip."
2,"Nice idea, but doesn't cut well at all...","I love the slightly curved design with safety tips, the compact size (easy to sneak up on my dog's face to trim) and the price wasn't so bad. Unforunately, the scissors aren't sharp and don't even cut my schnauzer's soft fluffy hair. Wish I'd gotten these locally so I could return them without a hassle. Don't bother with these."
5,My puppy had to have his hair cut.,I purchased the scissor for my 6# puppy and it has worked like a charm. I don't worry about sticking him and cutting him with these scissor's at all even if he suddenley moves or jerks his head.
4,"did not understand what ""curved"" meant",These are well constructed but I did not understand that curved referred to the scissor blades rather than the scissor tips.
4,My thanks to T.W. Parnell!,"This was a great book. T.W. Parnell was right on about what goes on during a postal exam from stating that the fact that practicing his techniques is your best bet at a good grade, right down to treating your pencil like it were poison when you aren't filling in those little bubbles. The techniques were excellent. If it hadn't been for them I would have felt very lost during the exam. With them, I was able to put everything else aside and concentrate on my exam which helped me to achieve a great score. The only thing that was better that his hints on acing the fourth part of the test was the audio timing CD. That was a wonderful addition. My thanks to T.W. Parnell!"
3,Great reference,"I bought this as a reference book and as something I hoped I could read front to back, but the writing style is too dry for me to be engrossed in. However, it has lots of info and some nice photos and illustrations."
2,Moderate introduction,"This book is really just a compilation of several smaller works, but on a whole it's not a great primer on the Roman Army. Greater detail can be found in various older works. A comprehensive overview has yet to be written."
3,adequate with some good colour photos,Adrian Goldsworthy is a world expert so I cannot fault his pedigree but his writing style just didnt gel with me. Even though the style didnt engage me there was lots of colour photos from some of the modern enactment groups showing how the equipment works etc and good discussion of how little we actaully really know about the army. personally my favourite read for an overview of the roman army is still Peter Connolly's 'Greece and Rome at War'
5,One of the 'Great Books' in the Industry.,"I first met Andy Laszlo some eight or ten years ago when he gave a two day seminar on Cinematography at NYU while I was director of the Department of Film, Video and Broadcasting at NYU's School of Continuing Education. One or two hundred students enrolled the first day, and as word spread across the campus of Andy's insights and trenchant comments, the attendance doubled on day two. When I learned of the existence of his book, I purchased it immediately. It is of immense value, not only to cinematographers, but also to directors, producers and writers: in short to anybody currently in film and video, or anybody who aspires to enter this field. It is immensely readable, written in clear, concise English and amply illustraed with some extraordinary examples, and a treasure trove of practicle knowledge. It is highly, highly recommended."
5,Cool,"I loved this book, just like all the other Diadem books. I can't wait for #5 and #6 to come out. I wonder if they will ever get very popular. Most people haven't heard of these great books yet."
4,Diadem 4: Book of Thunder,"Diadem #4: Book of Thunder, by John PeelFresh from their defeat of Sarman, the evil magician who tried to take over the worlds of the Diadem, Score, Helaine, and Pixel are thrust into another adventure when their unicorn friends are targeted by a deadly enemy. For the first time, the powerful trio is split up, as Score and Pixel try to solve the puzzle of missing unicorn, and Helaine stays behind to spy on the herd.Another good entry in the Diadem series, ""Book of Thunder"" continues the theme of evil being found on most of the worlds in the Diadem. As the most powerful magicians in the universe, Score, Helaine, and Pixel are the only ones strong enough to root out the different types of evil. Also present is how the power of friendship and loyalty, and the want to do the right thing, can triumph.4/5."
5,Great series,"My son, who is definately not a reader, loves this series. It took me 10 years, but I finally found something he enjoys reading!!!"
4,It is a good gift for your children,"It is a simple book, but is a classic, good for a gift for children under 13."
3,A Solid Effort!,"James A. Belasco and Jerre Stead use the metaphor of the mythological phoenix to underline the need for a leader to embrace change. They suggest using the phoenix to create a new vision for yourself and your company. Their ""phoenix principles"" include personal renewal, recognizing your connection with others and promoting their successes, committing to learning and to taking ""ownership"" of your life and your company. While the book is easy-to-read, and uses a nifty new metaphor, the ideas are a familiar restatement of Principles of Marketing, Management, and Organizational Behavior 101. We [...] recommend this book to those who haven't taken the basic course lately, or to those whose spirit needs a little old-style renewal dressed in fancy feathers. If you have employees whose focus is flagging, give them a flight on the phoenix."
5,Well done,"This DVD is well produced. You definitely get to see the history of the band through their own eyes. They have a knack for telling stories, and giving insight into the band. Clearly all of them have a good sense of humor. The DVD is well organized; it has a chapter menu that allows you you to jump around to different sections, and it also has a video section at the end. One of the coolest parts is the rare footage - from Milo of the Descendents singing Bikeage with them at the Warped tour to Scott's first show with the band. A must have for anyone who is a face to face fan, or anyone who is suppose to do a history of a band documentary - its a good model to follow."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Despite the hype of how great PC Guardian states this product is for the price my 32"" HDTV was stolen within 3 days of securing it using this cable. It doesn't show any sign that any damage was done disconnecting it from the TV. There was no damage to the cable it was just pulled out of the TV."
2,focused too much on graphics,"i really thought that the graphics on this game were cool, but the actual game play need some work. I played this game for like 5 minutes and I was already bored. I am a huge hockey fan so I was hoping for a little better game play even for a GBA game. But Im 12 so this game was really boring but for my 7 year old brother it was the best game in the world."
4,Just as good as the rest of the Backyard Products,"My son got the GBA Backyard Baseball as a gift and loved it. They already had soccer, baseball and football for the PC, so I never thought to get it for the gameboy. They recently got GBA Hockey and love it. We are going to buy a second one so they can link and play against one another.The backyard games are all terrific and the kids have not lost interest in over a year!!!!"
4,Master of the Game,"Simon is a serial killer who thinks it all just a grand game. He chooses his victims carefully. He watches them for months and knows all about his targets before he silently takes them. He is a friend to the ladies and no one would ever suspect him to be a killer. He challenges the FBI, John Hightower, in his ""Master Game"".Simon has a reporter, Frank Wycheck, typing it all up for a future book. Simon wants fame. Simon never expects to get caught.**** In my opinion, the author, William Tepper, captures the character of a serial killer very well, down to Simon's idiosyncrasies. I got chills while reading. I did not fully understand everything that was going on until I reached the middle of the novel, due to a few surprise twists. Good reading. ****Reviewed by D. Wilson."
2,Frustrating!,"I also believe that this game was a bit rushed. There are several things that I have found quite frustrating about the gameplay. Control of the egg is quite difficult at times. You can't go slow - you're either stopped or at full tilt. Jumping on buttons is ""buggy"" also. At some points, you have to bounce an egg on a button to continue the game. Well, I have bounced on them sometimes as many as ten times without activating them! I have also landed on a button and fallen off, leaving the egg up on the button and me on the ground. The other problem is the camera. It doesn't ""point"" in the direction you need at times. For instance, when fighting the ""boss"" on Pirate's Island, level 2, he jumps around a lot, and when he lands behind you, you have to stop and reposition the camera so you can take a shot at him. Often by this time he is gone!"
5,awesome,got it for my daughter and she loves it! my son enjoys it too. they were excited to find this game.
5,Wonderful,Vicky Tiel's Venus De L'amour is a wonderful women perfum spray and well worth the money for the amount and quality 3.4 ounces. I just love it!
5,A complete novel told in a series of verses,"Bellocq's Ophelia by Natasha Trethewey is a complete novel told in a series of verses inspired by the early 1900 E. J. Bellocq photographs of prostitutes in the red-light district of new Orleans. Bellocq's Ophelia is the imaginative and original tale of a woman who's brothel Madame tells her to act like statue on display for the male patrons of the establishment. Bellocq - April 1911: There comes a quiet man now to my room--/Papa Bellocq, his camera on his back./He wants nothing, he says, but to take me/as I would arrange myself, fully clothed--/a brooch at my throat, my white hat angled/just so--or not, the smooth map of my flesh/awash in afternoon light. In my rom/everything's a prop for his composition--/brass spittoon in the corner, the silver/mirror, brush and comb of my toilette./I try to pose as I think he would like--shy/at first, then bolder. I'm not so foolish/that I don't know this photograph we make/will bear the stamp of his name, not mine."
2,Ophelia's Gone,"This book implies to be a photo book with poems. The only photo is on the cover. It also doesn't say anywhere in the book that the poems aren't by the prostitutes either. It gives a date and photo name, as if to be a source for the poem. It implies that its a collection of poems by the prostitutes themselves. There should have been a statement that it's fiction."
3,good but not interesting,"I read double dealer in two days and it took me a week to read this one. The Sara/Grissom part was pretty boring and the bit about putting eh after every sentence of the Canadian CSI was a bit overdone. As a Canadian myself, i can garanty that no one says that. The Las Vegas story was ok but not much. What I find different in this serie it's that you can't read the stories has any other mystery, you arrive at the solution at the same time as the CSI, if the story is well written, you don't really get as big a surprise as you would get by reading a cosy but it can still be suspensful."
2,Poorly written,"I must say, I have not been at all impressed with the CSI novels. I think they are poorly written and predictable. I have not enjoyed one thus far. CSI has a good show and a GREAT computer game series, but not a good set of novels in any way. Parts of it sound like a kid wrote it. The forensics used are all pretty standard... there aren't any really creative solutions to figuring anything out.If just watching the CSI series isn't enough CSI for you, I HIGHLY recommend the computer games. Not the books though."
3,"Good, but a bit boring","I have to agree with ""A reader from Saskatchewan, Canada"". The character development was not there. That's probably to keep in line with the way the TV series goes (you rarely get a glimpse of the characters ""off the clock""). But in a book, you have a lot more liberties to get more inside the head of the lead characters. After reading this third book in the series, I realized I didn't quite like the way Collins ran time together. I mean, you're reading along and all of a sudden, the next paragraph takes you two or three hours in the future. I know it's nit-picky, but I usually expect a gap or other visual indicator between such paragraphs so you know you're ""fast-forwarding"" to a later event. I would say this was my least-favorite of the series so far. Too much time casting footprints and such in the snow for me. My favorite is Sin City (closest resemblance to an actual TV episode if you ask me)."
3,Fire the editor,"The plot was a little flat, but it does remind the reader of how the TV show is done. However, the editing was HORRIBLE! (In one case, the doctor tells Catherine to look at a body's right arm, then starts talking about the bruising on the left arm.) Maybe I would have liked this book better if I thought someone had read it before it went to the publisher."
4,"Yes, this is about you.",The worst thing about this release is that it's too short.If this were a full length it'd be my favorite from GAD.If you love Gatsbys and you can find this... Get it.
5,surprising and pleasing,"It took me a good three chapters to get into this book, but I was soon hooked. I enjoyed following the lives of three significantly different women and seeing how their lives change and grow -- all mirrored by the problems in Olive's short precious life. The writing is fantastic and so are the recipes! This book is an enjoyable read!"
3,Funny but Very Spicy,"This book has lots of color to the characters, which is what makes it interesting.I found them all interesting and funny. It can be difficult keeping up with each character the way the book shifts from one to the next. For me, the book was a little too racy with all the graphic sexual contents. The first few chapters were really good, but, afterward it seemed the book focused on almost all the characters engaging in sex. What turned me off was the in depth, graphic details of the sex the author gave--it seemed she went way overboard in adding that. The book would have been excellent without all that. The characters had plenty of personality, wit and charm that could have been further capitalized on rather than downplaying it by bringing sex into it.If all of this author's books center around sex, it is not what I am looking for to read."
4,Depressing but quirky...,"I liked this book, but found it to be a bit depressing although extremely well written. It wasn't a quick read for me (and I usually read a book this size in about a day) as I kept putting it down and coming back to it. The recipes and newspaper articles, along with the general writing style make it a fun, though not perfect read. Enjoy!"
4,A sweet read,"The author creates a small town in Louisiana similar to the town in which she was raised. The characters and their lives are delightfully described, and the reader gets to enjoy the sadness and happiness of their small-town existence"
2,Southern Fast Food,"-- A colorful smorgasbord of life, food, relationships, death, sex, and (perhaps the most pervasive theme in American literature) isolation within community. Yes ladies and gentleman, West attempts all this and more in her Cajun black comedy She Flew the Coop. The story is told by a myriad of characters, the most convincing of which is an old Negro maid named Sophia, who's still in love with her violent river-dwelling husband. And that is the extent of my praise. West's other characters get bogged down by pop clichés and never get off the ground in terms of development or complexity. Still, the story may have flown had West not laced the entire narrative with copious amounts of gratuitous sex. The result? An unsatisfying read that tastes more like KFC take out than the home-cooked southern supper I was hoping for."
2,"This book just made me feel, well, icky!","There's no other way to say it! First I picked up American Pie, based totally on it's eye catching cover. Loved it. Rushed to get Crazy Ladies. Loved it. She Flew...just made me sick. If it would have been my first reading of West I wouldn't have ever read more. The book centers on a minister molesting a child and basically getting away with it. YUK! After a bath, I felt much better."
4,Limoges is a town of gossip and scandal,"West has created dysfunctional characters that are nosy and gossipy (I see people I know in this town...)Olive Nepper is a teen who drinks poison to end her life because she is pregnant by the Baptist minister in town. This event and her ensuing coma, has the tongues wagging in town. The characters have a shallow and somewhat pitiful existence. We get to know Olive's parents, and their sadness as they endure their daughter's coma. We watch as their housekeeper Sophie, experiences spousal abuse at its worst.We meet DeeDee, the town tramp, who is searching for an escape from her unhappy marriage. DeeDee's daughter Billie, who is not yet 10, is the wisest and most delightful character in the book.West has included Southern recipes to pique our culinary interests which enhances the flavour of this story of living in Louisiana.If you like a soap opera style story, then ""She Flew the Coop"" is for you. I give this book 4 stars."
4,"Good Characters....Bad, very bad characters","Imagine living in a town where EVERYONE knows your business, sometimes even before you do, and thus is the setting of She Flew the Coop.There are a few good-hearted characters but most are bad, really really bad. Pervert preacher, skirt chasing husband, money loving floosy, crippled bitter verbal abusive vetern, wife-beating low-life, shall I go on???If you love to dish out gossip or always bend your ears toward it then definately pick up She Flew the Coop."
4,Our 4th Reading Selection,"We read this book in July of 2002 and our average rating rounded out to 4 stars.This book is set in the steamy southern town of Limoges Louisiana where gossip rules, everyone knows your business sometimes even before you do. Most of us didn't like the people of this town there were very few that were likable, with the exception of one little girl Billie.Most of us thought the this was a good book and here are some random comments from our members, ""Just like a good Soap Opera"", ""Captivating"", and ""an amazing jewel of Southern fiction"""
3,She Flew the Coop - and so Did the Story,"While West has great characters and intriguing developments, one gets the sense that she just got tired of writing and decided to end the book. One also gets the sense she doesn't like her characters much - as she ends up killing many of them off - but not before giving you lots of details about their sex lives. I mean, I'm one for steamy scenes - but this almost seems - superfluous. I want to know - where are you taking me in the story. And in the end - I'm still not sure. Lots of great intros to life themes and characters - but - oh I'm sorry, they're having sex again and I'm distracted. West has promise, but needs a good editor and someone to yell FOCUS ON YOUR STORY! Also, the print in the paperback, must be bigger. I have good young eyes, and reading it just made me tired after awhile, because it was so miniscule."
5,Best Dog Frisbee!,This is hands down the best dog frisbee that I've ever bought! It is extremely durable and flies very easily. It is so durable that I've been able to leave my powerful chewer alone with it without worrying that it will be destroyed. I'll definitely be purchasing more West Paw products in the future!
4,Dog loved it...but certainly NOT indestructible,"Bought this about two weeks ago. My dog Nacho ignored it for a couple days, then warmed up to it. In fact, it's his favorite toy to chew and run around with. But after only a couple weeks, my 40lb 10-month old puppy chewed a huge chunk out of the center (I'll add a picture to the product pics at the top of the page). This was used indoor only. He still loves running around with it and chew on it, but it certainly isn't indestructible as many of the previous reviews have stated. So now I've bought a Kong Flyer from Amazon tonight."
2,"The good, the bad and the ugly","The good: The ""Ziscs"" are soft and gentle on a dog's mouth. They are easy to toss and fly well. The dogs love them. The bad: They are no more durable than other discs while generally costing more. The ugly: The so-called guarantee. After the expense and hassle of sending one back (keep your receipt!) you could get a replacement or refund - 1 replacement or refund in your lifetime, regardless of how many you purchase. (That makes it a lifetime guarantee.) That may not be be false advertising or fraud but is very misleading. Find and support a more honest pet supply company."
2,Hole in the middle within 20 minutes,"My springer spaniel tore a 50 cent piece size hole in the middle of the Zisc within 20 minutes. I'm really disappointed. Hard to believe that other dogs who are labeled ""destructive chewers"" don't seem to be able to ruin the Zisc right away. Good for those dogs and their people!"
2,"fun frizbee, not for chewers",I bought a toy from this brand and it is quite durable so I got him this hoping it could withstand my lab/pitt too. He loves it but unfortunately he poked a hole in the middle and is ripping it up now but he had fun while it lasted!
1,2 minutes & this indestructable toy is destroyed by my dog,I bought this toy because it is calimed to be indestructable. Played with my dog for only about two mintues and guess what....it is NOT INDESTRUCTABLE. Paid way too much to find this out. Shame on false advertising and the manufacturer's claims. :-((
2,Flies like a brick,"This frisbee is not very aerodynamic. The edges are very square, and, hence, it just doesn't float in the air like a frisbee should when you throw it. I give it 2 stars instead of 1, because my dog nonetheless does seem to like the rubber material, as it provides him a satisfying floppy shake when he retrieves it, and the thing has not shown any signs of damage yet after about 30 throws so far."
5,Preferred Retrieval Toy,"Very soft and flexible, but stiff enough to be thrown easily. Our dog took to it right away. She prefers it to her other flying disk and all of her various balls. This is the toy that she brings to us on her own."
3,so hard to pick up!,"while my puppy enjoys chasing this (though it doesn't fly all that far), he has an awful time picking it up. we have had other frisbees before with a raised part that makes them land on an angle, so there is always an edge sticking up. this one requires squeezing to grip. please work on an improved design!"
2,(@_@) I'm Confused !! I rate this 2.5,From the beginning of the game I was confused as to what my objective was. I run into Sonic who asks me to help him out and then there's some weird star shaped thing with an eye in the middle telling me to destroy the Enemies. Enemies ? Which ones are the Enemies ? It keeps cycling from helping Good to Bad. I'm guessing the game focuses on which side you wanna take ... The Good or the Evil. Every level is pretty confusing that your just gonna have to guess your way through each Level. I'd pick something else if I knew this game wasn't very good.
2,Shadow The Hedgehog,"Do not buy this game!!Storyline 2.5/5I like the story,but too sad(You/you'll know what I mean).Gameplay 1.5/5The moves are better than the control...wayyyyyy better!Sound 2/5Voices vs. music! The winner is voices!!(The voices are ok,but the music isn't).Graphics 3/5Good job with the graphics(but the game still isn't good).Overall 2/5If you're a biiigggggg fan of sonic,they you might like it. But if you're starting to play sonic games,you won't like it."
2,Shadow the Hedgehog Disappoints!,My son and I rented Shadow the Hedgehog before we bought it just to try it out and boy were we surprised when we heard bad curse words coming out of the charachters. Completely unnecessary for this game and it will keep us from purchasing it.
1,Cussing,"E-10 this should not be. Shooting aliens is not a problem but shooting the ""good guys"" is. And as the title says, cussing. Dark or otherwise there should not be cussing. I have let me 8 year old play T games that I felt were not as bad. My daughter (3) heard Shadow say his ""damn it, not now"" and now repeats that. He says more at other times as well.Going back to the store."
2,Not what I expected,"This game is absolutely for the younger gamer. I have never owned a Sonic game, but the box looks like some of the more exciting games out there. I feel cheated."
2,Not what was expected.,"This game is bad. It just is. This game moves too fast to be a shooting/fighting game, and it moves too slow to be a Sonic or Shadow or whatever game. I played it once or twice and I got tired of it. Anyway, guns don't work out for a Sonic game. The shooting was probably something the designers added in in about two seconds. They probably just put it in there so it might sound cool. I wouldn't even recommending renting it. I am glad I rented it instead of buying it.Here's my opinion on the game:Scores out of 5Gameplay : 2Graphics : 3Fun : 1.5Durability : 1My Overall: 1 or 2I hope this review was useful to you"
3,Two thumbs down,"yes, this game is awesome but if your a kid it swears the d-word and the s-word. This game has really good graphics but it is not kid appropriate. You can either play 2 player mode or you can play 1 player mode and do story mode."
1,Horrible.,"Do not buy. Do not waste your time on this absolutely horrible game.It starts off by first acting like it's a remake of a Sonic game for Dreamcast, but inevitably it becomes tedious, repetitive, and the camera is absolutely abysmal. Simply was not done right."
3,Medi Dyne StretchRite,"It seems to be a good product. Being very flexible already (I work at it) it is of not much use to me, but if you have trouble in that arena, I would recomend it."
1,Not Useful at all for me.,I took it out of the package and right away I figured out that this was a waste for me. If you can touch your toes with your fingers while bending over your don't need this device.In my case I can place my whole hands on the floor while bending over at the waist. I also use my hand to swing the leg to the side while grabbing the leg form the heel while standing or lying down on the floor. I don't see how I this device could be useful to me.I gave it a 1 star because there is no choice for zero stars.
2,Medi-Dyne StretchRite Exercise Strap,Don't waste your money. Medi-Dyne has some good products like the Core Stretch which I love but this strap is a joke. You can just use a rope to do what this does.
5,recommended by physical therapist,"My daughter's physical therapist - a well respected expert in ballet and dance related injuries - recommended this for my daughter after she sustained a serious foot injury. It is as advertised and has worked well for our needs. My daughter's foot is healing, and her strength and flexibility are improving nicely. I have no reservations about recommending this product to others."
4,Great for car trips,"This CD is absolutely wonderful for car trips. My (just turned) 3 year old loves to listen to this in the car, and it's invaluable for longer stretches in the car. It really holds his attention, and he loves being able to identify so many of the instruments of the orchestra by sound. I've even learned a few things about the orchestra that I had either forgotten or just plain never knew! I definitely agree with the previous reviewer that some of the exchanges between the cats is annoying/inane for the adults in the car, but my three year old never seems to be bothered by it (of course!). (As the annoying bit is right at the beginning, after the first listen-through, we've just skipped that approximately 2 minute part of the CD.) This is definitely a hit in our car, and I'd recommend it to anyone with a toddler/preschooler looking to introduce their child to all the unique instruments and sounds of the orchestra."
5,"This is a book full of fun, useful date ideas!!!!!",This book is great!!! This book is the source for all our great date ideas. My fiancee and I use this book all the time for inexpensive ideas for activities. It has given us wonderful ideas to spend meaningful time together in inexpensive ways!
4,This book is a great book for teens.,"I have used many of the idas out of this book for dates, and the ideas really do create a cheeper, but yet fun date. Many teens my age have this book and use it, all I have to say is that there should be a pocket size version just in case of emergency. Every teenager and single or married adult needs a copy of this book, because there are so many fabulous ideas in it. The authors of this book direct their attention to more than one audience, and all of their books are well written, and a sipmle form of good entertainment."
4,Small but Effective,"The ideas in the book are more for the teenage audience, but many of the ideas could be used by adults as well. Overall the ideas are creative but some are a bit on the corny side.I'd also recommend 300 Creative Dates which is more creative overall and written for the adult in mind. I found it at 300creativedates. com"
4,THIS BOOK IS GREAT,"This book gives great ideas on dating. Given, some are corney but most are really good. You will definitly have fun with this book. And remember to have an open mind because once you tri it you will have fun!!!"
5,Great for a 2 year old,"My son loves this book! The language is simple and some of the lines repeat, so he can ""read"" along with me. He loves the part where the bear wakes up and growls, because he can growl like the big bear. The pictures are beautiful, and this book is definitely a winner in our house."
2,thought it was more.,We bought this for my grandchild. She loves bears. Nice photos but didn't keep her interest. This would make a nice addition to a bear theme unit.
2,"poor knock-off of Karma Wilson's ""Bear Snores On""","I can't believe that the author got away with writing this story! It has the exact same storyline with many of the same animals except it doesn't have the catchy and clever Karma Wilson rhythms and rhymes that help kids learn to read. Wilson's""Bear Snores On""was published three years before this book so she wasn't the one to copy. Kids always like animal stories and the illustrations are cute but I definitely recommend ""Bear Snores On"" over this one."
2,good try,"The book is a good attempt at tough subject.However, it's a bit confusing and hard to follow, even for someone with a historical background. The lack of a detailed bibliography is frustrating, but once you get past the legends and tales portion of the book and reach the guts of the story, its exciting reading.If one is intent on chasing the dream of finding the confederate treasure it would be worth the price of the book for the bibliography, legends, and myths. Certainly, any treasure story such as this is by nature half truth and half fiction with a pinch of doubt. I don't think it proves that the treasure remains or ever was in Danville. But that may have been the writers intention :)"
4,"Product good, seller bad","The product is ok....not as great a sound as they let on but passable.The seller, which stated the product was Available, didn't bother to ship it for over a month. It was supposed to have been a Christmas present and although it was ordered Dec. 11, leaving more than enough time for a on-time delivery, they just didn't care and didn't bother until it was much too late.I would buy this recorder again, but not from this seller."
1,A Hyperbolic Hoax,"The book seems to be based on the untenable premise that Shunju, a not very good chain of izakayas, are some of Tokyo's finest restaurants. This is just not true and though I live in Japan and am blissfully ignorant of the hype surrounding Charlie Trotter, the man has revealed himself as either shameless, or an ignoramus in an embarrassing introduction in which he claims Shinju has launched a culinary revolution in Japan--trust me it is not even on the radar here. The food at these places is not very good and the book is very badly written and edited, but it must be said that the restaurants and this book are very well designed and photographer Kawana has taken some excellent photos."
5,Finally!,"If you have ever visited one of their excellent restaurants, Shunju in Tokyo, you know what I mean. Not only their simple, yet very creative Japanese food, this book introduces you the essence of what makes their food special. If you want to learn and appreciate the sprit of Japanese food beyound Sushi and Tempura, this is the book for you. The photographs are beautiful, and cooking methods are very easy to follow. I highly recommend this book for any food lover."
5,Great book for creative pleasures,"This book is fantastic. Tonight I made the lotus root dish and it was wonderful. I also followed the book for Dashi and it was one of the best dashi's I have made. If you are into Japanese cooking and really want to explore something creative and fresh, this is a fantastic book to add to your collection.BTW i think a lot of the ""hard to find"" items will easily be located a an Asian market if you have one near by."
4,fans of Jon Arch era Fates Warning rejoice!!,"Paganize is a traditional metal band with some heavier borderline Megadeth moments....odd being their drummer plays with black metal heavy weights Emperor...but still....Evilotion Hour is a strong metal album...not power not thrash, just straight out metal...comparable acts could be Seven Witches, or Beyond Fear... In comparison Paganize is a better band then seven witches...no offense to Jack Frost and co. and Paganize is more consistant then Beyond Fear. so overall if you like the aformentioned bands...or your metal straight up with good solid vocals in a higher pitched ala Jon Arch, Geoff Tate, Bruce Dickinson...pick this up, it's a great disc...worth every penny."
2,Flawed,"Where it's good it's good, but sadly as in a previous work (Continent of Mystery - In which he states that Celia Fremlin wrote Christianna Brand's Green for Danger) it has mistakes in it that make you feel you have to double check everything you read in it.In this book confusing Nigel Strangeway's wife with his mistress is a pretty unforgiveable mistake given how easy it is to check the facts."
4,Good Case for the Price,"It is a little big for my Canon Powershot A-510, but you cannot beat the price.Pros:- Sturdy construction- Price (cases of comparable size cost more)- Zipper for main compartment (most other brands have velcro, which weakens over time)Cons:- Shoulder strap hooks are all plastic (other brands use metal)- Only one zipper (some have two that meet at the top)- Velcro for front pocketIt also comes with a belt loop that you have to unbuckle your belt to loop through. I prefer this type, because it is less likely to come undone. Other camera case brands have belt loops with velcro or snaps, which I suppose other people prefer."
3,Eyes do not open and close,"For the record , the manufacturer's description is incorrect as of this writing. The doll's eyes DO NOT open and close. That is the only drawback. It is a quality doll, just not properly represented at this time."
5,My granddaughter loves this doll!,"Calin is adorable, soft & easy to take with everywhere.My graddaughters imagination goes wild with dolls & this was a great doll for her collection."
5,I love it,"this is a great doll for my therapy. Its just a bit small, i thought would be bigger...but I am very happy with it."
4,Charming Bing at his best in turn-of-the-century Vienna,"This is a great movie for husbands and wives to enjoy together. Bing is an American phonograph salesman who takes on the Austrian aristocracy with humor, charm and the character that is only Bing Crosby on the screen. Sets and costumes are also well done. It's a 40's musical that's light and melodious. So make some popcorn, sit down with someone you love and just enjoy the music and fun of it. Bing at least seems to be having a good time doing it."
5,THE ALBUM...,"This is not just an excellent / perfect album, it is THE ALBUM!. I've discovered it when i was eleven, and still amazes me each and everytime i listen to it. Every musician did his best: Vivian on guitar wailing, Vinny Appice on straight-ahead drummming, Jimmy Bain on thunderous bass. Did i missed someone? Oh, of course the master himself, Ronnie James Dio, the roaring voice!!!"
4,RIP Ronnie James!!!,"This album influenced many modern Metal bands and probably every Power Metal band, and is Ronnie James Dio at his best: soaring vocals and fantasy laden lyrics. My copy disappeared during a military PCS move, and it left an untenable hole in my collection. This album is a piece of history that I am sure any Metal lover will enjoy having in their own collection as well."
5,Blew me away,"Literally every track on this album is a standout track. There's nothing left to be said about this cd that has not already been said. Dio's voice is inredibly powerful and booming, and Vivian Canmpbell's riffs and solos are catchy and fits the music perfectly. He's probably the first heavy guitarist Dio has ever worked with too. (Ritchie Blackmore had more of that 'classic rock' light guitar and Toni Iommi, while I still love the guy, his guitarist was more sludgey and simple while Vivian used pinch harmonics to and a really heavy tone to give his guitar that bit of edge) All in all, this album is simple mind blowing."
1,What?,"Hey, what happened? I bought this one, but Pat Boone doesn't sing on it at all! This Ronnie Dio fellow seems to be all right, but he's no Pat Boone - now there's a REAL heavy metal artist!"
5,"Currently, one of my favorates of all time.","I'm going to start off with an honest confession, I've only been a Dio fan for about a year now. But this album just blew me away, it's been a while since I ordered this, and it's still an entertaining as hell album. It flows so well with all the tight performances the band members deliver, the interesting lyrics, great songwriting and an overall, very energetic release. A must have for not just fans of 80's metal, but metal in general."
5,"Rest In Peace to a heavy metal icon, Ronnie James Dio","How can you not call this album a classic? Personally, Rainbow in the Dark is my favorite song on here, but every single track is great in it's own right. One of the top 10 metal albums of all-time, from one of the greatest singers to ever rock the mic. Rest In Peace Ronnie James Dio, you will be missed. \m/"
2,Classic In Theory but Overrated in Reality.,"There's no denying Dio's relevance in heavy metal's canon - however, I think the importance of this album as a musical statement is a bit overstated.While the songs, melodies, and riffs are memorable, I find Dio's LATER albums - particularly Dream Evil, Lock Up The WOlves, and his more recent, pre-death output - Magica, Master of the Moon, and Killing the Dragon, in particular - much better.My main beef is the production. Is it me or is the drum sound on this album TERRIBLE? Annoying....If Dio put this album out later on in the 80s or 90's, with real production values, I'd rate it higher.R.I.P. Ronnie."
3,Dio - Holy diver,"In aged condition compatible with 2nd hand goods.Cover box, inset and disc grossly intact with no unsightly damagesDisc playable. Quality acceptable with respect to pricing."
4,Solid debut from the Royal Roar,"I thought that HOLY DIVER was a very good debut album, but i don't think it is his best work. I have always liked Ronnie's work from Rainbow and Black Sabbath, and i think his albums like RAINBOW RISING and HEAVEN AND HELL are far superior to this one. Even his later solo efforts are better, LAST IN LINE is alot better then this, but still, this album rocks. It has the big radio hit RAINBOW IN THE DARK, and that is one of his best songs. The guitar is sharp and fresh, it simply shreads all over the place, people who think Randy Rhoads was amazing should listen to Vivian Campbell's work with DIO, Vivian Campbell would prison-rape Randy, no contest. The bass guitar is ex Rainbow and ex Thin Lizzy bass player Jim Bain, who does a good job as well. Vinny Appice is a firey drummer, he has some pretty cool drum fills. The album is a good intro into the world of Dio, the cover art is very representative of what his music is about. This is considered a classic, and it is."
5,Dio's best!,Ronnie James Dio is one of the most talented men in the genre of Metal. He is a legend. One listen to this work and you will know why he is a Metal god.
5,Great CD! The Best!,This is a great CD. You should buy it now. Dio rules and so does Vivian Campbell. This is the newest Japanese remastered version and it is the best you will hear. Grab it now!
4,"The first, the best!","This is the first Dio solo career's album, and it is his best. With Vivian Campbell (guitar)and Vinnie Apice (drums), it achieved an unique sound. The cover artwork, unfortunately, is ridicule, although very well drawn."
2,"Great album, horribly mastered! Beware!","First off, let me say that this should be a 5 star album. Dio is incredible, and his solo debut album is one of his finest.That said the mastering of this album is terrible. The guitars and bass are too quiet while the vocals are far too loud. Distortion and digital artifacts are easily heard all over the album, especially when Dio's voice reaches its high peak. Every time his voice soars it's accompanied by horrible crackling and popping. The guitars also exhibit this effect, especially on Rainbow in the Dark. It's almost unlistenable at points. The versions of these songs on my Dio Anthology collection don't sound like this at all, so it's definitely the mastering on this particular version."
3,4.3 STARS ACTUALLY,"THERE ARE TWO MANY WEAK TRACKS FOR THIS TO BE 5 STARS(MASTERPIECE) THE ALBUM STARTS OUT WITH 3 GREAT TRACKS IN A ROW BUT THEN FALLS INTO 3 UNMEMORABLE TRACKS IN A (CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE, STRAIGHT THROUGH THE HEART, AND INVISIBLE)THANKFULLY INBETWEEN THESE TRACKS THERE IS DONT TALK TO STRANGERS A VERY FAST AND HEAVY TRACK WITH WONDERFULL MOOD CHANGES. AFTER INVISIBLE COMES ONE OF MY FAVORITES, RAINBOW IN THE DARK. AFTER THIS COMES THE DISSAPOINTING ALBUM CLOSER SHAME ON THE NIGHT HTAT IS THE ONLY TRACK NOT REALLY LISTENING TO. I RECCOMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANY METAL FAN"
3,If you want the good songs get the greatest hits,"I am a Die Hard Dio fan but I have to say this album was kind of waning. The songs ""Rainbow in the dark"" and ""Holy Diver"" are about the only good songs on this cd the others just kind of bite the bullet. The albums that are really worth buying are ""Sacred Heart"" and ""Dream Evil"" cause those albums Rock! that was when the band was at the peak of their career. ""Holy Diver"" and ""The last in line"" are more like demo albums in my opinion. If you like only certain songs off the first 2 cd's then get the greatest hits. otherwise you're wasting your money"
3,Nice but small,"Beautiful piece, but I didn't read the size carefully enough. It is very small. I now will search for another one."
3,Book included with Audiopack - do not buy twice,The amazon website recommends that you buy the book as well as the audiopack. I did this but discovered that the book is included in the audiopack. Very misleading. I have not used the book or the audiopack yet so am unable to comment.
4,Are you married to a Serbian?,If you are married to a Serbian and wish to learn to speak serbian then I strongly recommend this book. It covers basic to every day language. My wife is learining Serbian something she always wanted to do but I think if you have a partner to help you along the way makes a big difference.
3,Catwoman,The first half of the first chapter sounds good and you feel you will learn some of the basics to get you by and then they throw Cyrillic at you. The rest of the dialoges are all written in Cyrillic making it impossible to follow while listening to the cd. This is not the cd and book to get if you are going as a tourist. Maybe if you plan on living there - but not to quickly learn a few words and phrases for a visit. Would not recommend it.
3,Good only for a sheltered area,"Material is very lightweight. Kept blowing off the grill. Had a tear in it after only a couple weeks, but experienced several wind advisories during that time. Would recommend it ONLY for a grill that is in an area that is mostly sheltered from the wind."
5,it was a great movie and i can whatch it for days,"it waas the most interesting movie i have ever seen and also the most exciting. i love it, it is my favorite movie its the only one i whatch anymore. the close ups are the best part."
5,2nd best Kevin J. Anderson and Rebecca Moesta have written!,"This book brings out Tenel Ka's character a lot. (Which is good, because I really like her.) I think the plot of the story is VERY good also. It's about a girl who faces the fear of being handicapped, and learns she is just as good as she was before, and learns not to let pride get in the way of things. I was not disappointed!"
4,Full of character growth,"One of the early books of the Young Jedi Knights series, this book establishes important facts and events in the character's lives, which will have repercussions for decades to come and are still playing an important role in the new Star Wars books of 2009.Recommended for all Star Wars fans."
4,Relationship Relay...,"There are a couple of really strong relationships going on in this book. Tenel Ka and Jacen (Naw Durr.) and, even if they don't know it, Zekk and Jaina. Tenel Ka starts to relize that she likes Jacen after he cut off her arm, and Jacen has already felt that way towards her. And Jacen is really scared that Tenel Ka will hate him for the accident he thinks he caused, when they both had equal measures of blame. And Jaina and Zekk's thoughts continually swirl around each other, moreso Zekk than little ms independent. Jaina and I are a lot alike, so I have an easier time seeing things in the story from her point of view. Which is probably why I liked 'Dark Journey' in the NJO series so much. Anyway, READ THIS BOOK!"
5,Poor Tenel Ka!,"This was just a little sad, but it was action-packed! This was a great book! I like Tenel Ka and Jacen in this book. ESPECIALLY when they argued over who's fault the lightsaber accident was! It was hilarious! Ambassador Yfra was a !%$#%@#%!!!!!"
5,Possibly the Most Turning Point in the YJK Series.,"I think this is one of the best stories in the YJK Trilogy, not only do you see HOW they make the Lightsabers, it also shows what happens when you don't take your time. I've read all of the YJK books out so far, and this is one of the best."
5,Pretty good...,"This was a good book.Not as good as some of the others,but still pretty good.My favorite partsare when they battle the Bartokk assassins,and when Tenel Ka finds out she can swim, even with just one arm. I think it's cool the way she can still beat Jacen at a swimming contest!"
4,Pretty Good Star Wars Book,"i bought this book about 4 years ago when it first came out and i am 10 now. i have read this book about 10 times. about 5 times i have read it in one sitting. now if you can do that,that usually means you have a good book. now i have not read the whole Star Wars:Young Jedi Knights series...i have read about 10 of the like 17 books. and out of those 10 ""Lightsabers"" is probably my favorite one.the book is practically about Luke Skywalker teaching his neice and nephew, Jacien and Jaina and some of their friends how to use the force and letting them build their own lightsabers."
1,"Short, skimpy, stupid","I must say that all of these ""Young Jedi Knights"" don't deserve to be capitalized. They are short, skimpy, and are the most stupid books I've ever read. Burn 'em."
5,Excellent,Recommend book to any interior designer student has great information on furniture and useful to learn to draw classic furniture.
5,Angelic Voice,"A voice for History. You have to discover her latest CDs, ""Ebhath Anni"", ""Rasael"" and ""Ouhibouka wa baad...""."
5,inspirational,"inspirational, nostalgic and quite magical... sadly difficult to access in the west... More needed..."
3,Exceelent performance - tech of recording so-so,"The performance of this version of Handel's Messiah is outstanding, especially Elizabeth Harwood's soprano voice. Malcom Sargent was the expert for this particular piece, and his interpretation does not disappoint. But, the quality of the recording has suffered somewhere. The performance was done in 1965, and the liner notes indicate that it was transferred using a customized ""state of the art"" Ampex tube tape recorder and an ""extraordinary analog to digital converter"", apparently in 1993 according to the copyright. All that may have been true ten years ago, but the recording mixing levels were managed incorrectly at times. It varies noticeably in several places, even to the point that some solos start out as if they were singing into a tunnel somewhere and then the sound level increases after a few seconds. I'm still looking for the ""definitive Messiah"" on CD."
5,Handel's Messiah at its Best,"I have to believe that Sir Malcom Sargent's interpretation of The Messiah in this 1965 recording has got to be what Handel would have applauded. Sargent spent 4 decades polishing this jewel. I purchased the original vinyl in 1978 on the Quintessence label(#P3C-2701). Previous reviewers have said it all, but let me add a few thoughts. Conductor Sargent, The Royal Philharmonic, The Royal Choral Society, and especially the soloists have woven a beautifully balanced version of this classic. And the Recording Engineers at both Quintessence and Chesky have done outstanding work producing both the original and the digital versions."
4,Legendary Pink Dots - 'Pre-Millennial Single' (Soleilmoon) CD Single,"Even though this four-track maxi-single(don't hear that term everyday,do you?)is very much over-priced,it's still a good choice for all true Pink Dots fans.Track listing is: the wonderous ""Hellville '98""(6:08),""Needles""(10:04),the mind-blowing ""Andromeda Suite '98""(11:08) and Abracadabra ZZZZ""(6:04). There are some times on this CD single when you can hear just HOW talented vocalist / frontman Edward Ka-Spel really is. I assume these are extras left over from their 'Nemesis Online' disc. Good experimental psych!"
3,Another singing soapstar,"And his songs are just as sweet and schmalzy as his soap wich is called ""Verbotene Liebe"" (Forbidden love). I don't know if he can really sing or not but on this album he sounds not bad. His voice doen't have the quality of Jeanette's but it's a lot better than Oli P.'s or Laura's.Most of the songs here are ballads but there are also a few faster songs. I like ""In heaven"" (a gospelsong), ""So in love"" a mid-tempo Pop-song) ""Forever tonight"" a duet with a singer I don't know but she has a great voice) and Department"" ( A soft-rocksong. He tries to sound like Jon Bon Jovi. He doesn't. But the melody is great)Buy it if you like to have a CD by a singing soap star who can probably sing (at least a little bit).PS. There's a hidden track on this CD: The acoustic version of ""In heaven"""
5,GREAT ! ! !,"This is unbelievable!! What an album! Christian is so handsome, but he is also a very talented singer/songwriter. He is no puppet on a string, he is a real artist and that's why I love him and his album. This album proves his talent and I hope we will see him in the US very soon. I know, everyone would love this guy!!"
4,Fine playing by a old master,"To say Earl Wild has lost none of his technique now that he is well into his eighties is not quite true.Scales,arpeggios and other passagework of a less brutal nature are intact,however large chordal structures and octave type passages strain Mr Wild more in his old age.This rachmaninoff disc displays the wisdom and still forminable technique of a master pianist who has lived and breathed this music for more than eight decades.beautiful interpretations BUY IT!!!"
5,Talk about Angelic!,"Search no further. This is the one that you were looking for. Angel in flight, doves. . . A real tear jerker!"
3,Is it Fun?,"Is it Fun?This book explains how this author and illustrator's life was and what he liked and what he disliked. Or in his terms: Fun or No Fun. The book explains his colorful imagination. He made a go-cart from an old sled. He wasn't a couch potato and just sat down and watched TV. He was active; he liked to run and jump and do all sorts of things. One thing I don't like about this book is it leaves me with some unanswered questions, such as when he is talking about what dogs are fun and no fun, Mrs. Kellogg's dog doesn't really say anything. I would like to know why he never went near the dog."
4,A warm and compelling story,"I very much enjoyed reading this book. The story is straightforward and believable as jimmy goes through many of the same troubles and adventures that many boys do as they mature. I was able to identify with and root for the main character, Jimmy. The story unfolded naturally and did not try to force a moral position upon the reader.The ending is upbeat without being sappy, and I was genuinely happy that things worked out for jimmy in the end. This was a very entertaining and easy book to read. I finished it quickly and feel it is a great book for young adults and up. I hope you enjoy it as well."
3,A little disappointed...,"It is always difficult to review a live dvd I think - you can never capture the atmosphere of a concert.Blondioe are great live performers though (as is eveident on this dvd), and they perform a good set, mixing the old and new music (which is 'classic' Blondie).So why am I disappointed? I saw this tour here in the UK, and there is so much missing on this performance. Where are the screens with the incredible imagery for exmaple? This isn't quite the same tour I expected it to be. Maybe the tour developed as it travelled, or maybe this was a one off performance, prior to the tour. Who knows...Again, I must stress though, that their performance is great as usual, which I suppose is what really matters."
3,liquid nail,"wasn't what i exepted and not as good as what I thought i was ordering,will work fine for some things."
3,"Great Gothic Setting, Convoluted Cast","This book has it all in terms of Gothic atmosphere -- an old castle, secret passageways, and even a dungeon that is now used for a wax museum.So what's wrong with it? Uhm, the characters, that's what. First, there are way too many suspects, and I had a hard time keeping track of each character's secondary identity, which type of book they wrote, personality, etc. As if that weren't enough, the main characters are caught up in ""ye olde big misunderstanding loop.""The plot is full of twists, turns, and surprises -- so there's lots of suspense, but believability is sometimes at a premium.I gave this book a C at All About Romance."
2,Very predictable.,"I love Heather Graham's work, but ""Never Sleep With Strangers"" was a big disappointment. I surmised ""who did it?"" by page 35. The characters in the book spent too much time running around looking for one another, similar to a live Clue game. This is not your typical Heather Graham book. I felt let down."
2,I've seen better!,"Interesting start, but I think it was too confusing for me. Most murder mysteries are interesting, this one was a bore. Maybe the next one will be better, I hope. NOT RECOMMENDED!"
3,Thought-provoking,"The authors present the book's premise well in the first chapter but they've (over)developed the topic in subsequent chapters. It becomes occasionally tedious, but there are nuggets among the pages that make it a worthwhile study. The points developed are valid and fully deserve to be pondered so, on that basis, I recommend this book."
3,OK book,"Good book, but not as good as Winston's other books. I didn't find it very useful as a learning aid for smalltalk, but think that it will be more of a help in going from novice smalltalker to intermediate/advanced smalltalker."
2,Nice Vest but too hot,"I saw this vest and read the reviews and thought it sounded great. It is a great vest for cooler climates, or if you like to be very hot. The mesh on the vest is too minimal to provide any real ventilation. I find that the only time this is good for me to use is in the early spring or late fall early winter. The only place I have enjoyed wearing the vest is in a completely air conditioned venue like a museum or sports arena. If you are like me and do not like to be hot when you are out photographing flowers, or other wildlife outside look for a cooler vest.Other than that this is a great vest, lots of pockets that I have found extremely useful for holding lenses, filters, batteries and other accessories. If it was cooler to wear I would use it all the time."
5,VOTE FOR PEDR!!! flippin' sweet!,"The shirt rules!! Any Napoleon Dynamite fan has gotta atleast have the Shirt napoleon wheres! right now i have the Pedro costume kit on order. Its probably flippin sweet. Now uncle rico...pretty much the worst movie EVER. i mean uncle ricos is. I say GET THE SHIRT!!!!Your Napoleon Dynamite Expert,JacobP.S. Chad Friday is the real expert he has seen the movie 47 times."
2,"Modem great, cord is terrible.","Installation was easy and it seems to work perfectly. However, the cord is a pain. It has a lously little connector that easily gets pulled out of the socket if you brush up against it, and that happens really often since the cord is only 3' long and its always hanging in mid air. This is a really crappy design and a pain to work with, I am going to switch to another brand."
5,Take your Lomo to Burning Man,"I am a long time attendee of the Burning Man festival in Nevada. I love going each year, and since I got my Lomo, it always goes with me. When you spend a week in a city full of neon, LED lights, art cars, and things on fire...you NEED a Lomo. Nighttime shots are amazing, and captures the surreal quality of this event to perfection. Daytime shots are crisp and lovely, with the desert sky a brilliant blue.It took me a year to 'eyeball' the distances for good focus, but now that I have a handle on that, most of my pictures come out amazing...and even the blurry ones look good!If it weren't illegal or immoral, I would sleep with my Lomo."
2,"Interesting fad item, shoddily made","Lomo got a lot of ink in late 2000, early 2001, so I bought one for about a hundred pounds in the little Lomo gallery in Clerkenwell, London. The camera was easy to use and a natural for me. I like available-light photography and took some nice shots in elevators and the London Underground, in the World Trade Center concourse in New York, and street scenes everywhere.I had it with me in Hoboken on Sept. 11, 2001, and shot a roll or two of the smoke-plumed downtown Manhattan. ALAS! Only one frame came out. I tried another few rolls--no dice. Apparently the shutter is stuck. I am stuck myself...on whether to throw the thing out or fashion it into some clever objet d'art. What do you do with a dead Lomo, anyway?We all have to kiss frogs sometimes, and this is one of mine. A nice Rollei or Olympus for the same money would have been a better buy, and I think that will be my next point-and-shoot purchase."
3,"Love the photos, Hate the camera","Theres a reason this is called a ""bad camera"" or a ""toy camera"".It is by far the most well made camera that Lomography has put out and it is still a piece of junk. I've had two screws fall out already. I'm planning on taking it to a watch repair place to see if they can replace them tomorrow.Go for an olympus XA2 if you can find one on ebay, they are cheaper and the images come out about the same.I was given a Lomo Crate with about 15 different lomo cameras in it, The only one in there I would recommend using is the SuperSampler. I have 3 of them and they're pretty solid for a toy camera.wiphey @ flickr."
2,Not thrilled,It was soft and comfortable but the design allows it to slip out of place and is NOT leak proof. I've found some patterns for other designs and plan on making my own.
5,They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore,"I watched this movie when I was 16-years-old on TV and never forgot it. It is lovely and touching without being mushy. I'm 50 now. My mother recently died. It's our first Christmas without her. My father is in terrible grief. All I could think was, ""I have to find that movie!"" I am so glad it's on DVD!"
4,Brought back memories,I asked for this for Christmas because I remembered watching it with my parents on tv as a kid. This movie isnt on tv anymore.Its not a high quality movie compared to today's standards but it is a really good story with a nice lesson.
5,The movie: House Without A Christmas Tree,"It's a pretty good Christmas movie. More about good motives etc. and the tugging of the heart, which is certainly part of Christmas. I would always prefer more about Jesus in Christmas. After all it is His birthday. But the movie is great entertainment and is inspiring."
5,The Meaning of Christmas,"Story about a 10 year old girl in 1940's Nebraska whose father refuses to permit her to have a Christmas tree. Even after she wins one for free from her class at school, her father is further outraged by not only the presence of the tree in his house against his wishes but that he also thinks that the tree was the result of ""charity."" Eventually the painful reason that the father resents Christmas, the Christmas tree, and even sometimes it seems, the presence of his daughter is revealed. I was about 10 years old myself when I first saw this special on T.V. and it made such an impression on me that I bought the DVD so that my nieces may see it. You won't be sorry"
5,The best Christmas Movie ever made for Television,"I cannot believe that this is finally on video... I've waited 27 years like everyone else, to see this again... I was only 5 at the time I last saw it, but it made a clear impression on me... I just found this at amazon.com, bought it, and it was worth waiting 27 years for. They should air this on CBS this season... The other video with the same family and cast is called The Holiday Treasure which is also sold on amazon.com... It's about the true meaning of thanksgiving... and if you like The House Without A Christmas Tree, than you will love The Holiday Treasure... They are both awesome. Makes great gifts."
2,The House Without A Christmas Tree,"Was not what I thought it would be, Older film. Did not like the acting! Out dated for me. Won;t watch it again."
2,Not a feel good movie,"I am always looking to add movies to my christmas collection, but there is not much positive I could say about this one. A lot of pain and bitterness throughout the film and you kept waiting for the big turning point when you can feel good again. This one had a tiny blip, but that is all. Its not a horrible movie, just not good. Christmas Snow is a similar story line, but done correctly."
2,The House Without a Christmas Tree,"This movie was a little too, goodie two shoes for me. It was more of a made for TV type of a movie. and not that well done."
1,not the greatest christmas movie....,"I am a connoisseur of Christmas movies, having seen practically every one ever filmed. This one disappointed me terribly. It wasn't the story line that was bothersome, but the actual filming technique. Oh well. onwards and upwards."
2,Great story BAD filming.,"This is a great story, but the filming quality is terrible. I was not expecting the ""sesame street"" type studio it was filmed in. There are some actual shots of an old school and house outside, but the filming on the interior is like watching a high school play on stage, so it was hard to get into the movie, kinda corny, actually. If you want a great Christmas movie you need to buy Prancer, with Sam Elliot. Now that's a great classic family christmas movie.!!!"
5,A Should-Be Classic,"The House Without a Christmas Tree is a story of faith restored. The father is devastated over the loss of his wife and loses all the faith in beauty, magic and innocence with which we are born. His daughter, Addie, is as vehement in her faith in magic as her father is not! With a steadfast stubborness the daughter redeems the father much to the approval of grandma. This is a must-own and a must-see for all families during the yule season!"
5,Still a great show,I saw this show many years ago. I still remember it. I must have been about 8 when I saw it because I remember that I could really relate to the young girl in it. I was just sitting here thinking about the show and wanting to see it again. I remember watching at least 3 in this series. I don't think I ever saw the valentines one tho. I wish that they all were on dvd.Each of these shows reminds me of my childhood and my family tho I am far from them now. These are great shows.
5,childhood memory,"I remember watching this when it was originally on tv when I was very young. I also bought the book as a child. I had always thought about it and remembered loving it. When I got to see it again as an adult with my own daughters, I cried when it was over. It's very touching, and even though it takes place in the 1940's, it's message is timeless. We will watch this again every year."
5,"*****5 Star, A++++ movie; PRECIOUS!!!","I cannot sing enough praises about this movie!!! I LOVED this movie as a child...always looked forward to seeing it every Christmas. Such a precious movie for the entire family to watch.Definitely is my VERY favorite Christmas movie...so endearing and sweet, taking one back to a simpler and quainter time...absolutely one of the most endearing movies there is!!!"
5,What a memory...,"I can't even believe I am going to soon own this video. My sister asked me what I wanted to Christmas. I told her the BOOK. She said, better Yet- they have the video! . I CAN'T wait. I am 29 years old, and two boys of my own now. I can't wait to share this movie with them. I remember reading the book as a kid, checking it out from the library at school. Then, seeing it on the tv. What a wonderful movie. I am SOOOOOO GLAD I will soon own it. THANKS AMAZON !"
5,HOUSE WITHOUT A CHRISTMAS TREE,I SAW THIS ON TV 1972. I JUST HAD MY SECOND SON. I WAS VERY TOUCHED AND THE ACTING WAS GREAT. I HAVE LOOKED FOR THE MOVIE TO B REPLAYED IN THE COMING YEARS. DID NOT SEE IT. SO ALL THESE YEARS I HAVE LOOKED FOR IT . SO NOW I WILL TRY TO BY A COPY.
4,A TV Film with a Good Message,"This story is about a little girl who lives with her father and paternal grandmother. Her father won't let her have a Christmas tree because of painful memories. It is somewhat depressing or disturbing in parts, but has an excellent message. It's good for family viewing, but younger children may be disturbed when the father has an outburst and uses the h*** word. It is also 'interesting' to see the father smoking as you'd never see that in a family movie nowadays. It seems to be a Canadian production that appeared on CBC. It is filmed in a studio format, so it seems like a play (if that makes any sense) similar to the British version of the Secret Garden with Sarah Hollis Andrews. Anyway, it's a good movie and I would recommend that people see it."
5,Nice,My grandchildren watched this and really liked it. Very family friendly movied. Gave them some enjoyable hours over the holiday.
3,Not My Style,"I remembered watching this new, but not much more than that. Now I know why.It's a good story, but one of those that is better as a book than a movie. (It was a very good book.)This is a movie each person must decide for themselves how good it is...It makes me feel like someone filmed a Broadway play on their vacation and is now sharing with friends...I, myself, do not care for movies that seem to be a filmed play, but that's just me.If you enjoy this type of movie then this is for you!It has a good story line with Jason Robards as the widowed father and Mildred Natwick as the grandmother I thought it couldn't miss.I'm sorry I bought it, but I would still recommend it to people who like play type films."
5,like live theater,I agree with the last reviewer.This film was not intended to look polished and well funded.The story is a simple family tale of love and loss and a little girl who believes in Christmas.She lives with her Grandmother and Father during the depression.It's a raw time in America and there are still raw emotions of loss haunting this family.But love and faith are triumphant in this story.The raw almost home video quality is exactly what worked to make this story more realistic.It's as though your right there with the family.I too grew up in the 70's and watched many after school specials that were written so well they captivated children without special effects.
5,I told my wife about this movie as we selected our Christmas tree tonight!,"As we drove to get our tree tonight I shared a special memory from my childhood. I told her there was a movie that really impacted me when I was a kid. Being born in 63' I was nine when the movie aired on TV. At that age special memories are made for a lifetime. This movie was one of them for me. I came home and searched the internet. I remembered Chrismas tree was in the title and I remembered the artwork for the house with the tree but didn't remember how they tied in until I found the movie online and emediately purchased it. I read the reviews and as I remembered parts of the movie, all I remember was how simple things were. I remember I appreciated family more and imagined what Christmas would be like without my Ma. This movie is awesome! I can't wait for it to arrive at my home. It seemed like the smell of fresh christmas cookies and pine are synonomous with this treasured movie. Thanks, Dave Hofman"
5,Glad I could share this with my children.,"I grew up watching ""The House without a Christmas Tree"" & I am so glad that I could share this with my children (they love it). Every time I watch this movie it floods me with memories & brings tears to my eyes. I LOVE this movie & I bought the other two that go along with it ""The Holiday Treasure"" & ""The Easter Promise"" & the book ""Addie and the King of Hearts"". I wish that the networks would show this & bring back family values. I am so glad that I have the whole collection now!"
4,The House Without A Cristmas Tree,"To be honest, I haven't seen the movie just yet but I do intend to see it just as soon as I get a chance. According to an individual who saw the movie when it first came out in it's heyday, truly believes that I'll love the movie after I see it and I'm told that I will probably wonder why I didn't bother to see the movie right after I bought the CD. First of all, it's in color today not in black and white like it was way back then and second, they just don't make movies as entertaining as they used to back in the good old days which should certainly make the movie so much more enjoyable. But most of all, I was assured that the movie was a warm, most rewarding, memorable and highly inspirational movie classic so what more could anyone ask for and which I'm happy to say that I was able to get from Amazon The House Without A Christmas Tree, and so I grabbed my own copy for my own video collection at just the right price."
3,OK movie...,"I would give this movie 3 stars. It's OK, but I wouldn't buy it again and I don't think it was worth what I paid for it but Amazon is always very reliable, with super fast shipping."
3,Just OK Christmas fare.,"I had never heard about this film, which is obviously a made for TV movie, but it had some good reviews and a strong cast so I thought I would give it a try. I watched the whole movie but it was a bit of a chore, the production quality of the recording to DvD is not very good and that was distracting and to say that it is slow moving is being generous. If you get a chance to see it broadcast and are really bored next Christmas give it a shot but I would not suggest buying it unless you just have to have every Christmas or Jason Robards film in your library."
3,A Sloooww Christmas Tree,"This story about a young girl & her stern father is good, but the pacing is almost torture. I'm sure this is due to fact that it was made in 1972 for TV, which had a lot more time to kill on prime-time programs. Still, it's worth a look if only for the young girl's (Lisa Lucas) performance, which is genuine and heartfelt. Don't get me wrong; I like the story and characters, it just needs a little tightening up."
5,My Childhood Christmases Revisited :),"I just got my copy of ""House Without A Christmas Tree"" just in time before the Holiday-and I am overjoyed! What wonderful memories I have of this film! I was about Addie's age in the early 1970's when I first watched this movie-and I have never forgotten it. My family watched it every year along with other Christmas specials. I'm watching it right now.This is my Christmas Gift to me! :)What a delight to see that the wonderful Star of the film Lisa Lucas/Addie has posted here as well! It was a real thrill to see and if you are reading this Ms. Lucas this film you starred in is a Classic. I guess you can see by all the reviews that you and your movie are remembered quite fondly. I'm going to track down all your other films too. :)"
5,A Christmas Tradition....,"I rejoiced when I saw that this video was available to own. This is a movie that I watched every year when I was a little girl. I loved the Addie series, and just acquired the Gail Rock series of books a few years ago, on which the movies were based. I searched like mad for the movie ""Addie and the King of Hearts"", and hope that it will someday soon be available to own. When I watch ""A House Without a Christmas Tree"", it takes me back to the warm fuzzies of my childhood. I wonder where Lisa Lucas is these days-- would love to hear her take on these movies from an insider's point of view. In my opinion, this movie should be considered right up there as a Christmas classic, like ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""Rudolph"". They should start showing this one again every year, in my opinion!"
5,Apple Orchard Kitchen Curtains-Valance,I had previously ordered the curtains and to make my window complete I had to order the valance. I just love these curtains they are so beautiful you have to see them hanging to believe it. You can take my word for it or you can order them too and low and behold you will see just like I did they are simply beautiful and well constructed. Thank You!!
1,Feedback on Bukowski book,This book is the most awful book I have ever booked from Charles Bukowski's list.It's impossible to read it. It's full of typos. I didn't know that it is a re-print of his draft. I spent 66 USD for purchase and delivery. I am so disappointing.
5,a very good dub,"a very good dubbed tape one of the best out especially for new fans This tape is where the fight begins and krillin fights bacterian(the only contestant who has never bathed in his life and rght before krillin passes out goku points out that... well I can't tell you though most of you know but some of bacterians attacks are hilarious and somewhat sick(hehe you guys know the attack im talking about, well if ure a japanese fan you do) I would reccomend this tape and both others although the side box art is lame goku has his hands on his stomach and is stuffed. so if you are a dragonball fan get this tape! and if you are a trunks fan pre-order the box set! and beware I wouldn't buy the first 6 tapes if I were you there untolerable. well cya"
1,Instant Disapointment,This DVD was quite disapointing. The structure was choppy. The overall look was cheesey and rough. And quite frankly I just can't warm up to Neon. I have a another video where she is part of an ensemble and she's the low point even among lesser known instructors.
2,Bad..Bad..Bad,The DVD covers all the moves needed for belly dancing....but it's soooo fast paced you really don't get a chance to practice what you've just learned.
1,Half a star?,"This is a terrible book. The writing is melodramatic, the situations contrived, and the characters, especially the protagonist, repellant."
4,For Anyone Who thought love existed in Cyberspace,"This book blew me away. Jenny is leading a double life, one as a not so well adjusted pyschotherapist, stepmom, and wife. The other as Zan, a woman in love with her dream man in the Cyberworld. She walks a numbing tightrope between the two lives and soon finds them meshed into one. This book will put anyone back in reality who finds themselves lost in the cyber love pool."
1,"modern fable, disappointingly told","Kit Reed's ""@expectations"" did not live up to my expectations of what she could do with the story of a young woman who falls into an online relationship, despite a new and handsome husband. The book reads like a soap opera, trendy maybe, but tedious and slow-moving and unrealistic. This modern fable could be told in engrossing style, but Reed has missed her mark."
5,Photo Vest,"This is the 3rd Domke Phototogs Vest-X-large-Khaki i have owned. Like the others, which I worn until they were worn-out, this vest is great for field work. I do not do photographs but I use the vest to carry all sorts of equipment into the field when I am watching birds and butterflies. The vest is great, the service was great and the price was right."
5,I've had mine for 30+ years...,"and LOVE IT!I use it all the time, and lives in my car with my tripod.Well worth the money!- Andrew[...]"
5,good,the tiffeb domke photogs vest X-Large Khaki is a nice production for the poeple who working out site to take picture.
3,"A good book, but comes up short","I have read every bed rest book I could find. This is not the best. The author has attempted to write a comprehensive book, and does a good job, just not great. There are better. It's very short, and after reading it, which took a couple of hours at most, I felt like I didn't have enough information. I wish the author would have had more experience with extended hospital bed rest. That would have been beneficial.**Recommended reading: ""Days In Waiting: A Guide to Surviving Pregnancy Bedrest"" by Mary Ann McCann, newer edition"
3,the pregnancy bed rest book: a survival guide for expectant mothers and their families,"I brought this for my daughter, she said it was not up to date. She would be lost without her lap top which enables her to do her shopping and baby planning, besides keeping up with her friends and her work."
3,"Short, brief, but has some good ideas","This is good, and helpful, it's just short. I was on the bedrest much longer than this author, and her suggestions weren't as helpful as I hoped they would be. I will be buying the other bedrest books for more suggestions."
4,Surrender to it,"You really need to warm up to GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935. It is essentially a B-movie comedy that was somehow blessed with the best production number of any Hollywood musical--but that's waaaay at the end. If you resist the temptation to fast-foward to the Busby Berekeley numbers, and surrender to the general nuttiness, you'll find the movie is actually pretty funny. Alice Brady, Adolphe Menjou and the fabulous Glenda Farrell are excellent, and even Dick Powell isn't so bad here. Gloria Stuart (of TITANIC fame) has a memorable line:Hugh Herbert: ""Put her to bed with a hot water bottle.""Stuart: ""That'll be more fun than I've had in ages.""Also, listen to the orchestrations during the musical numbers. They are first-class arrangements. I cannot even listen to any other version of ""Lullaby of Broadway"" except the one Wini Shaw sings here--it is the definitive rendition.BRING ON THE DVD!"
3,any idea what this would cost today,"Paying a chorus line of 20 in current times strains a budget.Taking a theme of rich people in the worst part of the depression,this film glorifies marrying for money.While making fun of the wealthy as pinch pennies andidle idiots, the film has the people making schemes to fleecethem.Not what you would call a moral epic in bad times?The musical within the musical is probably the best part of the show."
4,Good for packing,I travel a lot and need a headset that does not take up much space to pack. The Plantronics Audio 450 fits nicely in my computer bag. It works great for Skype and I have also used it with ViaVoice for dictation.The audio and mic plugs are similar in appearance and require close examination to distinguish them (I have added red and green marks).
3,Useful but Microphone picks up too much outside sound,"This product is very practical and convenient to use but the microphone needs to be better at canceling the ""outside"" noises. The mike is very sensitive and being omnidirectional the listener hears every sound occurring in the room when one is using speaking."
2,One headphone did not work - returned,"I cannot say much about these headphones as I returned them because they were defective (no stereo). However, while I was testing them, I came to dislike the ear pieces - the part that connects over the ear. Instead of giving a better fit - or holding on to the ear, they tended to get in the way and be a distraction. The size seems good though - as I wanted something small that would let me use Skype while traveling."
4,Worked very well for my needs,"I purchased these because I tend to get head-aches when I used normal headsets for an extended period of time. With these, there is no pressure applied to the to of your head, or pushing on your ears.I find the sound quality to be good for what they are, I wouldn't use them to listen to high quality music, but the sound is very clear and rich. The microphone is the weak spot for these. People I talk to have told me it sounds like I'm muffled or in a tunnel. They can understand me just fine, it is just that when I use one of my alternate headsets, they can hear me without any muffled sound.The only comfort issue I have noticed is that they can irritate your earlobes at times after wearing them for a long time. In general it isn't an issue, but it might be for people that wear earrings or have sensitive lobes.Overall I would recommend this product."
3,Does NOT work with Mac,"This headset works well for PCs. It is very portable and the sound quality is appropriate, so it deserves the three stars.However, it does NOT work with Macs, which have a different Audio Input port configuration. This is not explicitly mentioned on the product page or package, and Plantronic's website claims that it is compatible.I confirmed with their tech support that it does not work with Macs. Apparently you can get a Griffin adapter to fix the problem."
3,"Great a first, then shorted out","The product was perfect in the beginning. No background hum, no distortion. Used exclusively for a VOIP softphone application.Bought in March 2007 headset shorted out in July 2007.I bought it to replace a digital USB stereo headset that has a hum distortion but now I have to use the old headset because I can't hear due to the short!The ""lightweight"" in the product description should not be disregarded!!"
1,If you figure out how to use this item...,"The design of the ear pieces make this product borderline unfunctional. The ear buds are covered with the common type of padding making them too large to comfortably fit and stay in my ears and since the ear bud is the only thing to keep the headphones attached, any movement causes them to fall out. There is a roll of rubber under the earpiece allegedly to hold the wire away from your cheek/neck, but this adds to the frustration of putting them on. The added weight of the microphone makes the microphone side even more difficult to keep in a good position for talking. The sound quality seemed good, but the mic seemed especially susceptible to sounds of breathing, yawns and the depressed sighs of me trying to keep this contraption on... (and obviously the sound of the mic hitting my desk as it yet again falls off because I decided to look over shoulder.)"
4,Comfortable & works,"I got this because I liked the Platronics cell phone stereo headset. It wasn't the best for MP3, but better then decent, and very comfortable & small. This set is no different, the pinchers keep the buds from having to be wedged & pulling at your cartilage making them irritated. I have tested the mic/headset & the speakers so far work with websites as well on Vista. For the mic, I tested icon yahoo & it worked & AIM recognized it as well. For speech recognition, I had to put the mic all the way up which also brought the speakers up too high, so I turned down the speakers by using the speaker volume wheel. It has a great mute slide on the wire as well. The mic bar can also be turned to face the other direction in case you didn't want it in our face as well as possibly to be used on the other ear."
5,Excellent Headset for me,"I purcahsed this headset 3 or 4 years ago. I love them. Fit great, sound is good and i can use one or both ear pieces depending on my setting. AFter throwing these in my travel bag to many times I have finally broken the wires. Getting a new set, but ordering from ebay for $6. I can't believe these guys are selling an outdated set of headphones for $32!"
2,Poor designed n sound quality....,Floppy n Flimsy...they tend to fall of your ears when you move your head...I would not recommend this to anyone
1,Very poor quality,"If you're looking for an alternative for the comparable Wilton tip, get WILTON. All of the holes were not separated from each other, creating one big ridged blob instead of five individual lines. Horrible!"
2,Great Overview,"A nice introduction to what leadership demands. The topic can be a little dry at times, but the insight is worth pushing through. The book views leadership from a Christian perspective and has a great chapter on building Christian character. A good book for leaders, soon to be leaders and even reluctant leaders."
5,Get it just for the Bonus disc.....,"We all know the story about ""Born again"" Ozzy,Ronnie bad sound -bad mix....Bla Bla Bla!!!!! This Deluxe edition is awesome! Get it just for the live tracks on second disc,Ian does a great job with the sabbath songs and hearing the crowd sing along....is well worth getting this Deluxe edition of ""born again""!!!!"
2,Not worth the money.,Noticed no different in my hair after using the entire bottle. Hard to understand how this works since hair is not living and cannot really benefit from nutrients. Nutrition comes from inside the body. Better to use a good conditioner.
3,Too Mexican for this Confederate Yankee,"Anicani is one of my favorites from the Lawrence Welk Show, both because of her beauty and her marvelous singing voice. Unfortunately, the material here is too far into Mexican tastes for me. I would still like to have an album with her singing somewhat more familiar songs. She still has a great voice, and still looks good with it, although that matters little on a recording."
5,Touching...,"I've never been a huge fan of this show, in fact the holiday episode with Ann-Margret was the only episode I caught. That being said, it's one of the most touching and well acted (largely in part due to Ann-Margret's brilliant performance) show I've seen in a long time. This episode will surely make you teary-eyed...I was expecting a sappy holiday episode and this is in no way that! This is a great piece of work. Ann-Margret was overlooked by the EMMY committee (as usual) for this one."
1,good rainy day puzzle but not a print server,"Today has been too wet for yard work, but the TEW-PS1U has provided an entire day of entertainment. The home network runs fine both wireless 802.11b/g and hardline. This print server wouldn't connect to the wireless network, nor would it connect to an old 802.11b router. Web browsers and the included configuration program could access this server only through hardline ethernet. The router didn't recognize the TEW-PS1U as an attached device and could not assign an IP address. However, if a fixed IP address was assigned to the TEW then it could be accessed by browser. The printer could then be assigned to the fixed address TCP/IP port. Unfortunately, the USB port couldn't access the printer. Yes, the printer works great from a computer USB port.Conclusion: Consider this product if you are looking for challenging entertainment. Avoid this product if you are seeking a wireless print server, as it is neither wireless nor a print server."
1,BAD Business,Restocking fee for a bad product not compatable with Windows 7 - watch out these lovely people will nail you!
1,What a disappointment,"This was one of 5 movies I ordered for my grandchildren. What a disappointment. The movie is 30 minutes long and not really a movie. More like ""cliff notes"" version of what the story is. I guess I missed reading the write up of what this is, I expected a movie for the kids. Never again"
3,Hilarious but holds the attention,"One of the most hilarious mispresentations of hippie life ever written. All hippies are spoiled kids from wealthy families, and all hippies talk using absurd quasi-British sentence structure and slang. However, it does keep you reading just to find out what happens to the improbable characters, and some of the situations are believable. The scene where the guru comes to dinner about killed me laughing -- it was clearly a sendup of Dr. Timothy Leary. I still call highly spiced food ""enlightening"". Kingman manages a very realistic and memorable character in Rolf, the Vietnam veteran with PTSD. ""Vietnam veterans' syndrome"" was just beginning to be talked about in 1970.For a more realistic look at hippie life, pro and con, Lewis Yablonsky's The Hippie Trip is good; Jerry Hopkins' compilation The Hippie Papers gives an excellent intro to actual hippie philosophy and cultural contributions, as does Jesse Kornbluth's Notes from the New Underground."
4,The 1st review,"This book is good...but that's only if u like boox bout drug use(not much but sum)...runaways...(it's based on a 17-yr-old chick who ran away to find a life all her own...or as the back of the book says (2 sum it up shortly) ""17 yr old Wendy feels a desire 4 freedom and a need 2 find herself.She spends her summer in New York in a hippie haven.Wendy finds some surprising info bout herself."" Its worth the buy & the read. By the way it's the paperback...not the hardcover..."
1,Don't know! I Sent the Product Back! False Advertizing,"It's a good product from Garmin. But Amazon False advertized this product on their site for a third party company. These data cards are not an SD, they are just labeled data cards per garmins marketing. SD was added to the ad to make the consumer think it's a SD card which is not. SO BE CARFUL WHEN ORDERING! The SD cards are in a mirco format with an standard SD adaptor to fit many Garmins GPS units on the market.So all in all I returned the item and ordered thru another company."
4,Fills the bill,"This particular nail fits the gun well and does the job you desire. I was in the process of rebuilding the redwood fence and by using a nail gun, was allowed completion of the job in half the time.Recommended, as long as you observe the precautions of safety when using a gun. It is also necessary that the length of the nail meets your job requirement."
1,Dangerous Toy,"My two parakeets loved hollowing out this toy. Then I looked into the hole they had created and noticed that the wire that holds the toy extends almost to the center on either end. As the birds hollowed out the toy, they expose the wire.Although the wire is thin, it is consistently jabbing the birds the entire time they are tunneling to the ends. I cut the wire on the end I could reach, and tried to push the wire against the end that I couldn't get the scissors into. This is really a pretty sadistic toy. On the one had the birds absolutely love to hollow it out, but as they do they are tortured by the wire jabbing them the whole time. The ads for the toy claim the log is held by sisal, but sisal probably didn't work because the bird would chew it and the toy would fall. They substituted wires, but now the birds are being jabbed by the wires. I hope the manufacturer really cares enough about birds to do something about this toy.Until they do, I would not buy it."
4,Size matters,"It is what the description says it is.FWI I purchased the XXL size. I'm 6', 230 lbs and the XL would have been adequate."
2,"In concept, a great feature to add","The 460 is a great little printer, I bring it on business trips all the time, and people are always excited to see it (to print boarding passes, contracts, etc.)I was interested in going completely wireless using the battery and this BT card, but it is SLOW. It's directly next to my laptop right now and it took about 5 minutes to print a page that took no more than 20 seconds over USB. The file was not that large either.It is quicker to fly back home, pick up a USB cable, fly back, and use that cable than it is to print off a few documents over Bluetooth using this card.But, in concept it would have been a great feature to add to an otherwise amazing and functional portable printer. (Now, if this printer could scan and fax over VoIP/IP as well, that would be orgasmic!)"
1,HP Blue tooth,Product didn't work. Unable to pair with any devices.Tried multiple devices cell phones laptops etc. Product lights up like it is working.
4,A handy thing to have.,"I initially bought this device to use with an HP printer and it worked perfectly. Since I bought it, the printer has gone to printer heaven and I still use the blue tooth device for a number of other purposes. Unknown to me at the time of purchase, this device will connect an android phone to a desktop computer that does not have a built-in blue tooth connection."
4,Great for communicating with my Mac,"Works well for my mac and BT enabled Sony Ericsson phone. Other than the built in drivers for the printer in Mac OSX, support for options within the card and printer are non-existant. Still cant figure out how to manually force a realignment of the cartridges..."
4,I don't understand the negative reviews?!?!,I have what amounts to a portable office in my car; HP Pavilion dv9000 laptop in the passenger seat and a battery powered HP Deskjet 460 printer in the back seat that communicates with the laptop via the HP CB004A Bluetooth card.The set up was easy and printing with this card works all of the time. I have no complaints about the speed for text and graphics. I also have several other devices in the car and nothing interferes with the signal when I'm printing.I don't have internal Bluetooth in the laptop so I use an external USB device but I doubt that it has anything to do with how well it works. If anything I wish the battery charge lasted longer but I don't really have any complaints about this card.
5,So Much Information.,"So much information packed into this Hardcover book, I got this couple years back at Universal Studios Orlando, Or Busch Gardens Tampa Fla? I don't remember, but it was in A Egyptian themed section of the park? Now that I think about it, it's probably Busch Gardens. Wonderful jam Packed book. Literally A ENCYCLOPEDIA of Ancient Egypt. All the Gods/Pharaohs are here. Ramses, the Young King Tut, Cleopatra. so much, things about Egyptian Culture in those times, that I never knew.This book is what got me interested in Ancient Egypt in the first place."
4,Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt,"I am not the biggest fan of ancient Egypt, preferring their Assyrian and Hittite neighbors, but this book is very useful for anyone with an interest in the pre-Classical world. It appears to be well-researched (even if not up to academic level, as the other reviewers made plain) and is very thorough in its coverage of the life and times of the Egyptians. Included are short bios of all the pharaohs and many of the queens of Egypt, as well as a number of princesses, officials, and religious figures.This title would be of particular usefulness to someone studying Egyptian religion; its coverage of the gods, religious practices, festivals, and locations of Egypt is pretty deep.Included also are lots of black-and-white illustrations, most based on Egyptian artwork.Overall, the Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt is a singular excellent source for someone with a particular interest in the times and its major personalities."
2,not impressed,"Having done much research of Ancient Egypt from credible resourses, I found the Encyclopedia to be lacking. Many of the ""articles"" had little usable information or even incorrect information. Some of the information in this Encyclopedia was the same as that found in the 1880's Manual Of Ancient History that I own. This information, I must add, has been disproved by many new discoveries. I was very disappointed by this book. In my opinion, it wasn't worth the ... I spent on it. There are many other more credible books available that are more worth the money."
5,Nice AEGYPTUS,"This is a very useful book for young students or beginners, but in Japanese standard it is not an encyclopedia but a mere guide or handbook of the ancient Egypt. The reason is evident. For example, in the item of THOTH we can not find his Egyptian name DHWTY , & nobody can find pharaoh's name written in hierogriph encircled with cartouche. When we edit a dictionary or encyclopedia, if the item is Greek noun, we add Greek alphabet spelling after Japanese name indicating each vowel is long or short, et Latin alphabet aussi & at the end of every item, sources or reference texts."
5,Elinchrom OEM Cap!,"When I ordered this replacement cap for my Elinchrom studio strobe light I expected to recieve an aftermarket part, because of the product image displayed. To my surprise I received the exact Elinchrom OEM cap which has a hole in the top of the cap to allow heat to vent from the modeling light if you need to pack up before everything has totally cooled off from your shoot."
3,An adequate picture reference,I was disappointed in this small 160 page collection of TV lamp photos. The quality of the photography is good but the descriptions are short on info. The price values are unrealistically optimistic for the most part.
1,"bad, bad, bad","If you have ever played in a good Pandeiro before, do not get this one! It is just noisy and will make you mad. Put some more money and get a good one (what, right now, I still don't know which will be)."
5,2 killer dvds in one.,"Yup! This is a must-have if you can find it on one dvd. Killer footage from the guys who made skateboarding in the 80's: Screaming Lord Salba, Hosoi, Roskopp, Jessee, Natas, Grosso, Kendall, and many others! Santa Cruz was it! Find this dvd or 2 dvd, you'll love it!"
4,"Great little dispenser for Jelly Bellys, hard to figure out to set it not to take coins","We leave a stack of pennies in our office and dispense our supply of Jelly Bellys this way. Makes for less germs of hands reaching into a bag... It's small and cute and the only problem is that we never figured out how to set it to work without taking coins. Regardless, it's well used and liked with its contents."
2,Check the price elsewhere...,"Kohl's had this item listed at $19.99, then marked down. $25 is asking too much for a 9"" dispenser."
3,Good not Great,"It holds the beans. It's sturdy. It's well constructed. It's also undersized, and it crushes the beans."
3,Cute,"This is a cute novelty item, but 2 issues- the glass dome is very thin and you must be very careful, also the jelly beans keep getting stuck in the turn thing at the dome base. They still taste the same, but are a bit mangled by the time they get through."
2,A piece of Junk,you would think that since this is a dispenser it would come with Jellybeans... but NO it does not I will be returning this it did not even come in its own box they just threw the dispenser in a box in a box with some paper... A piece of Junk
1,jelly belly [as in 1],"this is a complete joke. when i decided to get this as a gift i looked at the listing and it shows the mini machine almost full of ""jelly bellies"". when i opened the box i found that it came with a little bag [about a hand full] that when put in the machine will barely cover the bottom. use it 4, ""maybe"" 5 times and your out. i didn't expect to have to order more from the very beginning. FALCE ADVERTISING PURE AND SIMPLE. DON'T BUY THIS PURE AND SIMPLE"
4,Excellent lost proto metal from South America,"Like Flower Travellin Band, Tarkus comes from a land that doesnt seem like it would have made an impact, but the power of Zep and Sabbath hit the 4 corners of the world. Tarkus hailed from South America taking there name from the Elp album (though sounding nothing like them). It is a great record of proto metal/doom with a Zep/Sabbath feel. The singing is all in Spainish, which i only know a little, but it doesnt take away from the music. Its almost poppy at times..but the guitar work and sound is awesome Iommi-like. Only 8 songs clocking in at just over 30 minutes..its too bad they never had anything after this..i would have loved to seen where they would have taken it. Apparently there is still a version of this band sans the singer(who is in some religious cult) is still playing in South America..someone should record them too."
3,It Gets Better,"Madonna's first album is average. She gets so much better on her later works. Madonna is great,but this album does not truly showcase her artistry like her other albums do. I would still recommend picking up this recording."
3,Sure it's her beginning but that doesn't meen it's great.,I don't like this as much as I like the rest of her album's. Her voice is very non-professional like and it ruins the very well-written songs that she sings. Today she is much better. The songs that are later albums are much more worth it.
3,THE PERFECT POP-DANCE MASTERPIECE,"it's been almost 20 years now since this cd was first released, back then released as tape or vynil...but many things have change since then...This album is still one of the masterpieces that light up and sustain the pop world.Just think how innovative this was when the lady in question stepped onto the music secne and into the spotlight.Some tracks have become true households in discos and homes alike: the bouncy LUCKY STAR, the pure pop-confection of HOLIDAY and BORDERLINE, the syinthesizer-driven EVERYBODY...including the sexy PHYSICAL ATTRACTION.GREAT PRODUCTION by Jellybean benitez...and great partnership.Maybe they would have benefitted of a shorter version in terms of length, yet these are pop standards by now.And Madonna was very much the music and the style of those years.As she still proves to be now."
3,"Long Live ""Burning Up""!","I like Madonna. I love the ""erotica,"" the ""ray of light"" albums, the ""vogue,"" the ""beautiful stranger,"" the ""live to tell,"" even the ""music"" songs. However, the essential Madonna song has to be on this album. That is ""burning Up."" I fell in love with it the second I heard it. whenever I think of great '80's music, i automatically think of this song, that and Prince's stuff. Not even ""material girl"" can compare to this! why this failed to become classic is very strange, probably b/c there's no video of Maddy rolling around on the floor in bracelets and '80's hair to revere. the line ""i have no shame"" pretty much sums up her entire career so early in it! this something Britney should be studying late at night... The rest is...nice...a bit dated, though. ""Physical Attraction"" is very charming. ""everybody"" is not."
4,First...,"This is the maiden effort from the world's most well-known lady, Madonna. At that time, this disco-infused effort was truly an advanced effort at dance music. Along with Shannon's Let The Music Play, Holiday ruled the dance floors with an infectious tune from a wide-eyed girl. Excellent!"
4,The album that set it all off,"Madonna's musical revolution started right here, on this album. Only 8 cuts long, it tends to fare better than albums with filler songs, like in Madonna's later work. Every song is a potential single. Very dancable pop that is definately worth investigating."
1,Shallow,There are much better books and resources to gain understanding of the encounters mentioned in the book. It left the feeling is that all you had to say? I don't know of anyone I would recommend this book to. It is too shallow to be of spiritual value to the infant Christian or those who having been following Christ for a long time.
3,Its ok,You can tell its a copy of the original disc even thought the price was not for a copy. Its Okay
4,Best band operating out of the south these days!,"I've been a DJ for rock stations in Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama and Tennessee, and I'm here to tell you....THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GROUPS TO EVER EMERGE FROM THIS REGION! Their music just makes ya feel good, and ""Lucky Day"" is their best album! From the rather concise ""Catch 22"" to the 20-minute jamming of ""Amorous"", you'll find this to be a rich, deeply satisfying album. These young guys have old, wizened souls, and it shows in their music. Also a formidable live act!"
2,Poor solution for Nokia 3595,"I bought this headset adaptor so I could use my Plantronics headset with my Nokia 3595.The connection between the adaptor and the phone appears to be okay mechanically but is highly intermittent electrically.Jiggling the connector helps, but as you know, with a cel phone, you can't expect things to be stationery for long...so it quickly drops out.I ended up buying a cheap COMPRO headset just to try the included Nokia adaptor. It works great! The only drawback is that the adaptor plugs into the headset jack and the power jack at the same time, so you can't use the headset while you're plugged into the AC adaptor.I think the ultimate solution is for Nokia to adopt the industry standard 2.5mm headset plug...but until then, I'd try something other than the Belkin adaptor. Bummer."
4,NEED TO DO TEST FIRST useless on a newer toilet.,"I realized this is only effective when using it for OLDER toilets.We have a newer toilet and when I did the test for how much water was draining from the tube,(making a mark in the bowl etc.)It was zero on ours. There were no waste going down the tube so I'm guessing this would beuseless to install on a NEWER made toilet bowls.I love the concept of the product and I would have bought it in a heartbeat if I was losing water.I just wanted to let people know that your toilet may not need this product. You should ALWAYSdo the test before purchasing this. The test is easy to do stated on previous reviews.You just need to mark the water level in your toilet bowl with tape, marker, pencil etc andflush the water. When it get's to the mark you pull out the clear tube that's going in the white largertube and put the clear tube in a different container to see how much water is wasted."
3,go the distance,"I have purchased 4 of these since they arrived at Home Depot last year. At first I really liked the product especially how well they keep the bottom of the tank clean. They appear to be better than the Fluidmaster at first but 3 of the 4 have had to be replaced because of valves that won't shut off. And THAT does not save water! If they can remedy that problem so that they last 3 years as that lengthy testimonial stated, then I'll change my rating to a 5 star. Right now, however, the product's longevity does not meet my value expectations."
5,The very best!,"I had the old type intake valve. The ball was messed up. I replaced the entire intake valve with this product. It was so easy to install, and it works perfectly. I had never fixed anything like this before. Buy it, you will be happy!"
2,"No longer fills the tank, house much quieter now","Well, it lasted almost three years, and I guess that's pretty good anymore. I replaced it this morning with a Korky QuietFill, and am now enjoying the relative silence. The HC660 sounded like a turbine engine when flushed. Good for entertainment with jumpy cats and visitors in the house, not so good at 2 am."
4,"Good valve, but noisy","This item does what I want it to. It WAS pretty easy to install, but you must READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. Since I had seen this in other reviews, I did so, and it was painless. I do believe that it will save water.It turns out that I did not need the HC660, since I do not have sediment problems in the tank. If you are like me, you will only need the HC550.My one complaint is that it makes a big CHHHSSSSSSSHHHHHH noise when you first flush it, with or without the tank-cleaning-extension attached.After that, though, it fills the tank quickly."
1,Not a good kit,"Easy installation. But this Toilet Valve kit is so loud. In addition, the package & instruction show the kit should come with a cone supply washer and nut. For some reason, however, the washer & nut are not included. I checked a couple of other packages I bought, same thing. I have tried to contact MJSI by email & phone. They are not replying my email nor return my call.Stay away from this kit."
1,"Broke after 1 year, and loud","After 12 months stopped turning off water. Also, valve is really loud. Actually glad it finally broke, now flushing is quiet again."
1,"It sure does save water, because it doesn't fill the tank","I have had this product for several years. It hasn't worked right for a long time. The cleaning tubes didn't fit right and sprayed water everywhere. I could never get a flapper that worked with it. The float had to be tapped to refill the tank the last several weeks. Finally, it just flooded my house. The toilet got plugged by a teenager. The toilet kept running after he got it to flush and ruined my carpet in the hall and living room."
1,"Move on people, nothing to see here",This thing is a piece of junk. Difficult to adjust out of the box. Did not last two years. The valve was still working but the plastic parts to adjust the shutoff would not stay in place to effectively turn off the shutoff.
5,A Great Product,"I rent and every new place I move to I make sure to buy this to replace whatever is currently in the toilet. I'm not sure if it's just in my mind but I find it to be quite a bit quieter then the standard toilet. I would definitely reccomened this for anyone doing toilet repair, it's super easy to install (took me about 20 mins for two toilets). Buy it with the combo to save money."
4,Good product,"Purchased and installed 3 sets, and the install instructions were straight forward. I had one issue with a leaking toilet, but stepped through the troubleshooting instructions, and that was corrected. Overall, I'm very happy with it - it works as advertized."
3,"OK replacement, but doesn't match the hype","Despite the cool picture and blue color, this thing is really just your ordinary fill valve replacement, in fact, I saw one of almost identical design at the big box store, except only in black, but for four bucks less! On the good side, it's still working as it should after about a month of usage, no sticking problems that others have reported. On the not so good side, it's fairly noisy when you first flush, though I realize this is inherent in the design which forces water to rapidly flow out the 4-5 holes in the lower tube (which is what helps to ""clean"" the tank, by agitating sediments in the bottom of the tank so they become water borne and get flushed when the tank empties). As far as install, nothing to it, and adjustments are straight forward and simple, just like any fill valve. Overall, if I have to do it again, I would probably opt for the similar unit at the big box store since it was about 30% cheaper and looked like it would do the same thing."
2,One year in and they're sticking.,"What a great idea that really does save money and water. I also made the marks on the tank to see the savings and it is definitely a money saver. The fill cycle is much quieter too, so it doesn't disturb the whole house late at night. The problem that has started happening, is that both units have started sticking and won't trigger a fill until I take the lid off and push the float part down. I thought that if one did it, it was a limited problem but both I purchased are doing it. I have no clue why it is sticking. I've tried everything to try and fix the problem. Good concept, but obviously there's a design/manufacturing problem."
4,"Works, but may need so adjusting","Bought this along with the water saving flush flapper. The Toilet valve installed easily. It adjusts easily and works well in combination with the flush flapper. The only issue that I had involved the valve sporadically not releasing water on a flush. The float would drop, but no water flow. I could remove the tank lid and tap on the the top of the valve (blue piece at top of picture) and instant water. So, after about 6 times of doing this (again it was sort of random), I decided to take the blue top off of the valve. Warning, turn off the water first! I learned this the hard way. You push down and twist the top like a medicine bottle cap. It comes off and reveals the valve. I let water flow through it, reseated the top of the valve and haven't had a problem since. My guess is a piece of dirt or something was coausing the needle in the valve to stick.Overall, I'm satisfied and ended up buying one for each toilet in the house."
3,Great minus the tank cleaner feature,This product has been working great except that after 7 months the tank cleaning hose broke off and stop my dual flush from closing letting the water flow like crazy. I threw out the part of the hose that broke off and jammed the dual flush (would also have kept a flapper open.) Now it works great again.
1,Worked great - for 6 weeks,"Installed easily, fit great and worked well at first. It seemed a little flimsy, but I hoped it would last a while. A little noisy, as some other reviews have noted, but not enough to bother me. After being installed for 6 weeks or so, the valve no longer shuts off, so I'll have to replace it. I hate fixing things twice..."
3,"easy install, low price","Was as cheap as regular fill valves, and after quick/easy installation I could see the cleaning tube pushing around sediment that had been there a few years, helping it go down the drain & clean the tank. A little tab easily adjusts the rate that the tank fills so it wont fill the bowl too fast & waste water.**update 9/24/11**only had this 9 months & its already broken, it wont shut off so the water is always flowing/leaking"
1,Costly Failure $$$$,"Installed this as a replacement. It failed after about six months and then sprayed water everywhere causing thousands of dollars in damage. The shut off feature triggered, but was of such poor quality that it failed immediately and shot the water out. This was worse than just having water running since it sprayed it out of the toilet bowl so that the overflow tube didn't prevent water damage."
3,Hydro-Clean Toilet Fill Valve,"The product was exactly as specified. It was delivered promptly. Install by a professional plumber, he had never seen it before and claimed that he thought it wasn't that good. Being all plastic, he doubted it will last more than a year. We will see."
5,Plumbing update,The HydroClean fill valve was very easy to install and set up. I works very well in conjunction with the dual flush valve also installed in my 30 year old Commode. Both items brought my toilet up to 21st century operation.
5,Works as stated,"MJSI HC660 HydroClean Water-Saving Toilet Fill Valve with Cleaning TubeI saw this on ""ASK THIS OLD HOUSE"" This unit works very well, I highly recommend this unit. I also purchased theMJSI HYR270 HydroRight Drop-in Dual Flush Converter. Please see my review before purchasing."
1,Anachronism,"Would Charlotte Bronte have used words and phrases like ""neurotic"", ""prime site"", ""mindless entertainment"", and ""middle class"", as Clare Boylan does in finishing a Bronte manuscript? Not in any Victorian novel I have read! But worse than the frequent anachronisms is the soppy plot. Absolute tommyrot. The book is a waste of time, but its ersatz Bronte-esque romantic aura will make it a favorite of those who like that sort of thing."
4,"If you loved Jane Eyre, you'll enjoy this novel!","I just finished reading Emma Brown and thoroughly enjoyed it! I am a huge Jane Eyre fan (I force it on my 12th grade Brit Lit students every year!), and I was apprehensive about someone trying to write in Bronte's style. This book did not disappoint, however! It is beautifully written, and often sounds like Bronte herself. (The first two chapters ARE Bronte... this is from an unpublished partial draft). Treat yourself to this novel!"
3,Wasn't good enough!,"A good friend and I are doing Side Show for a end of the year exam and we were very excited because we had all the music downloaded and our script in the mail. When we received the ""vocal selection"" we were greatly disappointed with the cut versions. We had to change around our whole show to build around this ""vocal selection."" I recommend the actual score for anyone as serious about this play as we were!"
1,A waste of 15 bucks,"This CD actually made me mad. I haven'theard this kind of derivitive junk in a long time; Endless, meandering ""jams"" with weak playing and even worse lyrics.Spare us!"
5,Where are they now?,"Another totally excellent offering by Blue Miracle, but, their second, and last. Their website no longer functions and nobody seems to know anything about them, or where they went. I have a suspiscion they were local to the Baltimore/Annapolis area, but have no proof of that :P If you like stuff like Widespread Panic, then Blue Miracle is for YOU!"
3,Good movie.,"Young Elizabeth Blair and her sister Mary live at a orphanage. Their parents were killed in a automobile accident. A Mr Morgan likes Elizabeth and her sister and wants to adopt them. But he did not want Mary and Elizabeth to know. After pretending he was watching Mary and her sister for his friend Hiram Jones Mary and Mr Morgan fall in love. And they live ""Happily ever after."""
4,GOOD EARLY SHIRLEY,"This is one of Shirley's early movies when she was just too cute and an amazing little actress. Film features Shirley singing ""Animal Crackers in my soup"". There are only a hand full of her films that I will always remember and this is one of them. Heidi,Bright Eyes and The Little Colonel were the others. The DVD has both Black and White and Colorized version. I am not a fan of colorizing anything,but since they kept the original intact, I did enjoy watching both."
1,stinky...,"How many different ways are we to see shirley temple being ""cute"" before we get sick to our stomachs! O.K. so i'm not a big fan of the child star, and if this was an interesting movie then perhaps I would overlook the nausiating ""curley top"", it is not however, thus the one star rating. I could go on but i won't. O.K one more thing...is Shirley Temple suppose to be cute, because i just find her abnoxious and spoiled...ok now i'm done."
4,Great,anything Shirley temple I love! It is such a great movie and I loved giving my girls a piece of my childhood.
4,Album is almost as fun and lively as their live shows,"Anyone who has seen them live will appreciate this album. Their style of music is fun to listen to, but the album also allows the listener to focus more on the lyrical content of the band's music."
4,Evocative and beautiful storytelling,"A lovely YA fantasy set in Hobart, about Undine's search for her father - which ends up being a search about herself, her history and the magic in her blood. Beautiful and evocative writing, and some really gorgeous character relationships, particularly the teenage ones."
2,Unimpressive,"To be honest, I wasn't very impressed by this book. It was kind of an interesting idea, but horribly cliche. Another girl who finds out she has magic powers. I'll admit that the ending wasn't that obvious but I never really fell in love with the characters. Undine is definately a Mary Sue. She has virtually no faults, she's beautiful, and all the guys want her. And I'm totally confused about who she's in love with. Is she just promiscuious, or can the author not decide who she falls for? And sometimes it feels like the author is just filling in space.I did finish it easily in one night, so I suppose it wasn't a waste of TOO much time, but there are much better books out there."
5,Good one!,"I usually use Biotherm products, but they tend to be little expensive. I came to look for a cheaper alternative on Amazon, without sacrificing the quality that my skin is used to.I must say that I am very satisfied with Baxter Aftershave balm and I will certainly try some of their other products.The balm is quickly absorbed by the skin leaving it feeling silky smooth and it does not burn the razor cuts, because it's alcohol free.I would recommend it to anyone! Worth every penny!"
3,Less than advertised,The write up and image presented with this product implies that it will come with 1/2 inch thru 2 inch stoppers/cables. When in fact it only comes with 1/2 inch thru 1 inch sizes.Otherwise this product works fines as long as the pipe your placing it in has very little pressure (aka fluid dripping thru it.
4,Updated guide to who is buying what.,"This is the 1999, 7th edition of the useful guide for anything collectible you want to sell. The comprehensive item listings cover nearly 400 categories of collectibles and 250 buyers with their name, address, phone, fax, e-mail and web site in many cases. Each buyer-listing provides information regarding the items they buy and an indication of the price ranges paid. Collectibles range from action figures to lighters to wind-up toys. In addition, there are about 20 pages of buyers of misc. items. The volume is easy to use and completely indexed. Well worth the price for anyone having collectibles to sell."
2,Not What I was Expecting,"I purchased this video thinking I could use it with my new baby. It is actually just for the new mom. Although the exercises are short (ten minutes each I think)I had a hard time finding ten free minutes to do these. When I did get to do them I found them to be too easy. I would consider myself to be an ""intermediate"" level if not below that. I was looking for something that made me sore the next day and fatigued at the end of the workout but that is not what I discovered. I was disappointed with these workouts. I would say that if you have any exercise experience that you should try something else."
2,Not a workout with baby DVD!!!,I was so disappointed when I found out--only after ordering it--that this DVD is not a work-out with baby DVD. The workouts were too easy and I didn't see a point in doing them if my baby was going to be staring at me the whole time from his swing.
5,Quick and it works!,"The first time I tried this video I thought it was too easy to be effective, but now that I've completed it a few more times, I've found it to be just right. It's easier than some workouts I'm use to (The Firm) but great when you only have a few minutes. The ab section is my favorite, just right for new mommies and it even gets my heart pumping."
3,Solid Collection of Shipwreck Stories,"Wes Oleszewski's ""Ice Water Museum"" is the latest in his series of books about obscure shipwrecks on the Great Lakes. This volume is no different from the others in Oleszewski's series: it combines reconstructed dialogue and extensive research with speculation on what really happened to these ships. Oleszewski's prose tries too hard to be colorful and I am uncomfortable with his creation of dialogue, but I give him credit for the obviously exhaustive research he has put into these stories. I admire the fact he sidesteps the famous shipwrecks and focuses on the lesser known disasters which are no less important or interesting. He clearly loves the history of the Great Lakes and his passion shines through the often-stilted prose."
3,Quirky Satire of 60s Southern California,"This is an odd film, not as stinging as other Southern California satires (The LovedOne, Lord Love a Duck) from the same time period. Still worth seeing for some interesting performances. Tony Curtis in an off-beat role, Mort Sahl in one of his few film appearances, and Claudia Cardinale trying to adapt to Southern California."
5,Another excellent entry in the series,"The fifth Martin Beck novel. When an apartment building under police surveillance mysteriously explodes in the middle of the night, it's up to Beck to solve the crime. Was it terrorism? Assassination? Or just a gas leak?One of the better novels in the series, this is the first one to deal seriously with organized crime and the underworld. It also gives more time to the hilarious Gunvald Larsson, introduced in earlier novels but here playing a major supporting role.An excellent crime thriller."
5,read this book,"thanks to amazon.com for this forum and I don't want to step on any toes, but if you need to read this book I will lend you my copy until they get some in stock"
3,no title,"Boy! I thought I'd never finish this book! Had it with me on a covered wagon trip in Montana - 416 pages of small print. Writings from all sorts of people, lettered and not, about the American West in all phases. I sent the entire chapter on the cattle frontier to one of the men who helped run our trip. On the whole, informative, but dry. Not as readable as ""The Plains Across"" by John D. Unruh, Jr. The stuff about the cowboys and Indians was good, though. Written in 1963, it is not as current as Unruh's book, either. Contains writings of some famous Westerners such as John Wesley Powell and Brigham Young. Thomas Jefferson's instructions to Meriwether Lewis were very interesting. Also the executive planning of Hudson's Bay Company, stuff on mountain men, the famous Cow Column piece, and lots on the Southwest."
3,"Nice music, very anyoing tracks after the music",Don't forget to stop your CD player after the first 10 tracks. They are very relaxing until you reach track 11 with very annoying test tracks that are useful only once and can damage your system.
5,Enlightening,"I purchased this DVD on Amazon, however it is the same programme shown on PBSThis DVD is based on the book ""The Third Jesus: The Christ We Cannot Ignore""It is illustrates Jesus and the Christian teachings in a different lightIt is in keeping with the teachings of Spirituality and Divine ConsciousnessI find it is truly inspirational and stimulating"
4,not much new,"If you're looking for true enlightenment you might not find it here. Chopra is a authoritative thinker with much wisdom to share, but most of ""Secrets"" is a rehash of things he has discussed before. For those new to his work this is a fine introduction, but for followers this video won't give you much new. It might be better to buy one of his numerous books."
