1,movie was better,"the movie had action, drama, good characters with a decent story line. it is not acadmay award material but the book bored me. the book is all about the time in the military and the different facets of this military and it seemed to have no direction. it dragged and had nothing to keep you interested whereas the movie had the war with the bugs but there was little battle and action. it was one long book about being in the army with little or nothing interesting. so it seems most people disagree with my review. i see 1/22 people agree with my vote. im sorry people but this book put me to sleep. i found it so complacent and boring. i like heinlein but my daughter (18months) has better books than this."
5,"Great, Often misunderstood piece of scifi","While many consider this the archetype ""boy with guns"" novel, it is actually a deep and compelling examination of society and citizenship flanked with action packed fight sequences.The questions Heinlein asks are all worthy of examination. What makes a citizen? What is the meaning of responsibility? What are people's obligations to each other and to their society? When the movie removed the philosophy in favor of showy violence it also took out the heart that made this novel great. Indeed, it was reading this as a teenager that first peeked my interest in political theory.Unfortunately, many people have decided that this novel represents the author's ideal society. Interestingly, Heinlein has an enormous body of work that argues for every social structure from fascisms to anarchy. What makes his work great, is that each is in some ways compelling in the context in which he presents it."
5,Read it before the movie comes out!,"Up with _Stranger_ and _Moon_, this is one of Heinlein's absolute best. Everyone else has gone into depth about it, so I won't. However, if you are interested, I can tell you now that the movie is going to trash it. Do NOT see the movie first. =) Besides, any sci-fi fan should read this"
2,Dry for Heinlein,"I am a Heinlein fan. Stranger in a Strange Land, Friday, and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress I have all loved and read more than once. Actually, Stranger is my favorite book of all time. Be that as it may, I was shocked at how dry and shallow I found this book. No real characters, only names. No depth to the story, just an interstellar space war. It would have made a great comic book, I guess. 2 stars instead of one because I've read worse (it could have been boring and not just flat and lost.) Please, read everything else you can by Heinlein, but let this one go."
2,"A poor man's ""Forever War""","I received the book while participating in a book swap years ago, but never got around to reading it, although I was familiar with other books by Heinlein. When I saw the movie, I thought, ""Yep. This is one of Heinlein's stories."" I dug out the book, and was very disappointed. It is a pretty good book in its own right, but having read ""The Forever War"" by Joe Haldeman previously - and considering it one of my all-time favorites - I felt this pales by comparison."
2,not what I thought it was going to be...,"I checked out these reviews before buying and reading Robert Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers."" I was looking forward to a good read. Boy was I in for a surprise!"
2,"Pedantic, boring, overrated.","This isn't a novel so much as a collection of pedantic, ""philosophical"", ramblings on war and government that are either (at best) truisms which would only be insightful to a child who has never done much thinking or (at worst) illogical or pointless proclamations.One of the most overrated books I have ever read."
2,I don't get it,"I was expecting something completely different, and no, I wasn't expecting something along the lines of the movie. I'm a big scifi fan, but I don't really consider this scifi. Sure, there are space ships and marines killing bugs, but in the end. It's just a long justification for war. Mind you, I'm not anti-war, and I did enjoy some of the battle scenes, but I felt like this book was 1 long lecture. The ideas they presented were ok, and cleverly thought out ( I especially liked the speech about Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happyness), but lecture it was, and not scifi in my book. I'm moving on to Stranger in a strange land, and I'm liking it much more."
2,Hardly a Classic,"I must agree with a recent review - not at all what I thought it would be, especially after watching the trailers for the movie. And agree with another - it is like a lecture, as if Heinlein was afraid we wouldn't get it. He certainly was afraid we would get distracted if there were too much action or too much technobabble. Make me feel something, make me care, make me hate, but most important of all - make me figure it out on my own."
2,"Old classic, but slow","This book was, no doubt, great in its time. By modern standards it is extremely slow. There is very little action, most of the book is a lot of preachy lectures (literally lectures from profs) telling us political background and theory. It was original and unique in its day, no doubt. But now, although the tech holds up in spots, it is quite dull to actually read. I'm not sure why people always rate books a couple of bonus stars for being old, but this seems to be the case here."
2,Starship Troopers,"I was excited to jump into Starship Troopers after reading Sirens of Titan, another book nominated for the best science fiction written in 1959, expecting something of even higher quality with ST winning that prize. With only 40 pages left I have found myself struggling to finish this extremely technical and dry book.My recommendation is to not read this book if you were a big fan of the movie as it bares little resemblance to what I have read. The bugs are not mentioned much and a lot of the story revolves around the details of daily military life. Very disappointed with this novel expecting a rousing combat tale and left with a boring and slow moving story that does not make a lot of sense. BTW I am not here just to bash this book, I read a lot and know a good book from a bad one, just here to warn anyone who may have been mislead by what they should expect. There is little in this book that is memorable or exciting."
5,You'll miss the point if you blink,"Two major objections to this book:1) Lame story 2) Not really scifi, just a thinly guised political tract.One reason why it doesn't matter:RAH extrapolates a possible society based on Federal Service. Even though he skimps on most of the usual scifi details, he elaborates endlessly on the ""what ifs"" of military life.Those who get caught up on the lame storyline (and it is a bit lame in conventional terms) misses what the book is about. The main character Johnny Rico starts the story in RAH imaginary world, but outside his idealized system. And then, through page after page of mind-numbing preaching, you understand why the world is the way it is. As Johnny learns why it all matters and has to be the way it is, so do you. The plot is carried internally with its main character. The bugs are just window dressing on the plot.As a side note:With this is mind, the SS Troopers had about as much to do with RAH's book as a PBS special about whales has to do with Moby Dick."
3,It makes one think ... life today is not that bad.,"This book is getting outdated. Read it now. It will make you think. However, it is not as classic as some would make it out to be. The dialogues are poorly written. The enemy illdefined, and the characters are ... poorly conceived.Otherwise, the book offers some potent and fascist answers to world problems today. The author obviously had some gripes against society at large, but at the same time, he destroys his rebellious and radical stature by composing a dialogue that gets no more realistically vulgar than ""Gosh"".No Action. Just politics. Most of it bad. Still, it was a great read!"
5,"It will make you think, if you give it a chance.","Enough people have retold the tale in brief so I don't have to. The real meat of the book concerns rights versus responsibilities. I came away regretting not having served my country in the armed forces, and committed myself to using my voting franchise in as responsible a manner as I can. (end of soapbox)One thing that did come home to me in a big way is the report in the book's ""history"" of the juvenile gangs: I look at the gang scene around the country nowadays and wonder how, forty years ago, he could know us so well. Did he have the ""right"" solution to the problem? I daresay, with proper responsible handling of the lesson of choices and consequences, it would serve us better than our present system. But, would we be brave enough to try it?Definitely read with your kids. I have."
5,One of the best books I've read,"I would have to rate this book as one of the best books I've come across. Outside of the entertainment value (excellent character development, good plot) it was an excellent source for philosophy, politics, and sociology. This novel made you think. In some ways Heinlein's future world is better off than our own (though there are some rather obvious flaws). This book is so thought provoking. It'd make an excellent subject for discussion in any philosophy, political science, sociology, or anthropology course. This book not only set out to entertain, but to make the reader think. And that is what makes this book one of the best I've ever read, it did both."
4,"Good, but unrealistic","Good,readable book,but it is too unrealistic - it is too old.Itis vision of impossible future.At present we have better computersthen in the book. No use of virtual reality, aiming computers annd so on..."
5,Excellent Book,"Starship Troopers, though written in 1959, is a great read. Heinlein's military background serves him well in describing the trainingof the main character. The action is very good, and the political discussion is very astute and remains pertinent today."
5,A series of straw men.,It is fascinting to think that this was written in the fifties. It is one of the first of its kind and set the standard for how sci-fi soldiers fight. However the philosophical points are not well defended and uses straw men arguments to make their points. He assumes that men are atomistic and ignores the possibility of a sui generis social reality.So I would say read for the military experience and don`t worry to much about the philosophy.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Fight for your rights.Or that is what it boils down to. A political exploration of a society where to have any say in what goes on requires you to enroll in the armed services, even if you are actually not capable of being a space marine, you will be placed in a support role that can make use of your more limited physical abilities.The story follows a young man who decides to join up and does get sent out on a bug hunt, and his growing intellectual maturity to go along with it.A bit on the dull side, really.2.5 out of 5"
5,Fire the moron is who wrote the Amazon review of this book!,"How dare this person presume to decide for us what should or should not be used by the reader as a political manifesto !!!The reviewer's arrogance is typical of socialist ""thought police"" who propagate, and try to enforce, ""political correctness""!!!"
3,"Confusing, stupid and a bit good!","Starship Troopers gives an interesting view into the philosophical and moral standings of a society in the future. Although I really found the book interesting in this regard, I also found it disconcerning in the same respect. Robert Heinlein drags out and repeats many of the moral and philosophical statements he presents. This made the book boring to me in some regards. As a Sci-Fi book, I think it failed almost utterly. As a statement of military/social philosophy and how it affects a person, it did quite well. For $6.50 it is not a bad yarn."
5,A great novel of a war with science fiction characters,A wonderful tale of war. Robert Heinleins best book ever.
5,"This book is an all-time classic, and it shows why!","This book is great. When I bagan reading this book, I was reading primarily for the science fiction and action. I soon learned that that is not all this masterpiece encompasses. The way Heinlein depicts society at the time this book was written is magnificent. Although I am not greatly into politics, I could get into the philosophical meaning of the political environment of the time. In addition, the boot training depiction and battles are vivid and thorough. I recomend this book to anyone who is interested in 31st century combat (this means you, mechwarriors) and analytical thinking. Or for that matter, anyone who wants THE BEST!"
5,great book,I've read this over a dozen time since I was a kid. Looks like a simple book but has great depth.
1,"Great Book, Terrible Reader","I first read this book in Junior High and loved it. Over the years, from time to time, I have read the book again. So I decided to get the Book on CD and listen to it on a road trip. Big Mistake. This reader book requires a gung ho reader, not the wimpy reader they selected. Save your money and stick to the book."
4,"This book is one of my ""guilty pleasures""","You see, I'm still to some extent the peacenik I was during the 'Nam years, and this book is war, war, war. Two different interstellar enemies. A society where you have to be a vet to vote (even most hawks I know don't quite agree with that). This doesn't result in disenfranchisement along lines of gender--the Space Navy is made up of women! But the core of the story is based on the rites of passage of a real human being in the Herman Wouk style, not that of the writers who do Rambo-clones. Our hero Johnnie Rico is an easy dude to like. He feels. He hopes. He suffers. He triumphs. As a recruit, he fears and resents his superiors, only to later on count his service under them as making him the soldier he has become since. So he learns, too. I first read this book in junior high--it's one of a string of Heinlein books aimed at youth. But today, I'm only a few years younger than my grandfather was back then, yet the thing is still in my collection. Go figure."
4,Prophetic picture of a multi-ethnic mono-cultural army,"One thing I'd like to add is that Starship Troopers offered a brilliant preview of what our Army has become in the last 15 years: a successful multiethnic institution. The soldiers in the book come from practically every society on earth. The narrator, for example, is a Tagalog-speaking Filipino named Juan Rico. As military sociologist Charles Moskos has pointed out, the reason the U.S. Army succeeds in getting people from a diverse variety of ethnic groups to work together is because it is NOT multicultural: it's monocultural. It imposes a very distinct militaristic culture upon its recruits. And it offers a unifying goal: victory. (Sports teams are similar.) This offers lessons for the rest of our society, especially our elite universities, which are having so much more trouble dealing with ethnic diversity than the military or college athletic squads.Steve Saile"
4,Common misreadings of this book,Many reviewers make mistakes about the society portrayed inthis novel. First is that citizenship can only be earned throughmilitary service. Not true. A number of alternatives are mentioned e.g. becoming a subject of medical experiments. Second is that this service is compulsory. Fact: all service is stricly volunteer. Once in the service one can quit at any time with the exception of actual combat i.e even people in military service can quit between battles. The penalty for quitting is only the loss of what is given for successful completion; the vote and the privilege of holding elected office. People who want to call this book fascist and militaristic will continue to do so; but keep the facts straight.
1,I HAD to put this book down!,"After watching the movie, I was expecting much better from the book. Instead I got a slow-moving book mostly about the thoughts of Johnny Rico, instead of the war he was fighting. I did find the suits the Terran Marines wore interesting (including their absence from the movie), but the book just couldn't keep my interest. I had to FORCE myself to read this book to its end. If you like the action of the movie, do NOT read the book!"
1,"Heilein at his goose-stepping, paternalistic worst","Heilein wrote some pretty good SF, however he also wrote a lotof trash. RAH was probably at his best in short-fiction (as can besaid about most of SF), and there are many SF gems to be found among those works. The worst element of his writing is at the fore in this book, Heilein standing on his soapbox and beating the reader over the head with his simplistic politics. It's no wonder that this book has appeal with its simple solutions to complex problems (a hallmark of RAH's work), especially at a time when the pendulum has swung well over to the right. The question is; would this book even be remembered, let alone held in such high regard by many, if it wasn't written in the genre of SF. I strongly doubt it."
4,One of my favorites!,"An excellent story! Full of politacl philosophy, it follows the path of an army volunterr. Some action, but it's the character development and political beliefs that take center stage. Not for young teens, more for the older child. It makes you think"
4,A great book for teenage boys,"I read this book back in 1960 and thought it wasa good novel with mostly childish views ofsociety and militarism. It was and is, however,an excellent action novel for teenage boys."
4,This certainly is nothing like the movie,"This book really is an attempt for Heinlein to show the inadequacies with the democratic system, and the pros to a more rigid facist system of government. It's an interesting philosophical book, though I can't say I agree with his points, especially as the book is clearly very one sided in his opinion, only the adults explaining this world view, with younger people arguing the other way, and losing the debates, as well as changning their opinions. By an large there are far more chapters filled with debates supporting the position than action throughout the story. There is action, and the book is entertaining, but in the end it is a book tackling the issus of government, and methods of handling punishment in a militarialistic way. This may explain the fascist undertones of the first movie. Read this for a more old school science fiction approach to issues, not for an action novel."
2,ARMOR WAS BETTER,dont waste your time with this crap. Check out Steakley's ARMOR. People claim it as a ripoff. They obviously missed the point. At least the military in ARMOR was smart enough to get past the machine gun and come up with some real weapons...
2,Boring Waste of Time,"I can barely describe my disappointment after finally settling down to read Troopers after 35 years of SF. Ninety percent of the ""action"" takes place in the protagonist's head; sorry, but boot camp ruminations are B-O-R-I-N-G. One hopes that the movie version will replace this right-wing proselytizing with an actual plot"
2,"See the movie, ignore the book","Paul Verhoeven's film version of _Starship Troopers_ does something with this story that Heinlein was apparently incapable of doing: makes it entertaining. Verhoeven took a military tract verging on religious zealotry and turned it on its head, using its very words to put the lie to Heinlien's ideas and ideals. Verhoeven's cutting parody of military propaganda makes Heinlein's treatise look flat-footed and dull."
2,FOR THE LOVE OF SPEACHES AND TRAINING,"OUCH! I'm still kicking myself for reading this book! The movie is on my short list of All-Time Favorites. This novel is NOT!!I remembered liking ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" (another Heinlein book) as a kid. I don't like Starship Troopers tonight!The speach by Rico's HS teacher (about how to raise a proper teenager), with the anology of training a puppy, was really GREAT!But hundred more pages of speaches and training details took away the faint glow.The amazing battles of the film version were very exciting.This book was not exciting. There are only a few pages of action.Deaths of characters are frequently mentioned ""after the fact"" and ""after the battle"". I can't believe how much was ADDED to make the film so good!The alien ""Bugs"" are rarely seen. I started to skim pages...not caring.If political debating is your sort of thing, then go for it.Otherwise, find another way to spend your precious hours!"
4,"Not a perfect book, but highly interesting nonetheless!","I never really got to like Johnny Rico very much, but his story is certainly an interesting one. The constant flashbacks from his days as a fighting M.I. trooper to his high school memories to his boot-camp training days keep this novel moving at a fast pace. Johnny always seems to be at the low end of the totem pole, just barely surviving to advance to the next level. But he's still a bit smug at times, and I just never felt much sympathy for him. And while I don't necessarily disagree with Heinlein's political views, I got tired of his trying to bring in every single geographical group of people on the planet into the military. It smacked of those modern, politically correct Saturday morning cartoons, where every little group of kids has a representative of every race & religion among them. In the same fashion, Johnny's unit is made up of people from every single country on the planet. It just seems too contrived to be real."
4,Way Better than the Film,"More interesting, more palatable, and shorter than the movie, the book also makes much more military and technical sense. All the co-ed trooper stuff is gone, as well as the silly tactics and whatnot from the movie. The book is very much a political statement however, arguing the need for more discipline and greater sense of duty, which could be interpreted as semi-fascist I suppose. Good, short fun."
4,Mix of Entertaining and Compelling,"Heinlein, in this age of passivism, provides a controversial pro-military book. Heinlein reminds us that there are great virtues to be had in the military life, that soldiers are indeed different in fundamental ways than civilians (or could be with the right training) and hints that our current fear-of-death is less noble than those who embrace the possibility of death and the virtue that can come with facing the unknown. This is a classic work of science-fiction that can be read as both an entertaining story and a thought provoking look at what we could have if we truly did aspire to become 'citizens.'"
4,StarShip Troopers-The real story,WARNING!!!!! This book only slightly resembles the movie! Which depending on how you liked the movie is probally a good thing. The book like the movie(in this way only) follows the life and military career of Johnny Rico and his adventures with the mobile infantry. The book covers Rico's days in basic and his eventual rise in the MI.Filled with famillar faces and places but will take on new forms. (Dizzy to be one of them) the book is an enjoyable read. with ups downs and some surprises and disappointments.You can see some of heinleins obvious political subtext that he hides in his stories but if you want a great miltary read with eanough sci-fi elements. go for it.
5,The Best Book I've Read Yet!,"Absolutely nothing like the movie, much better. I highly reccommend this book. I've read this book numerous times, and I still enjoy it every time I read it. Check it out!"
1,how could anyone like it???,"By far the worst book ive ever read- and ive read a lot. There was no point to it, and it had no action. Want a good sci-fi book? Try Sphere or the Area 51 series, dont waste the money on this. If you were expecting it to be like the movie youll be even more dissapointed! DONT GET IT!!!"
1,military glory,"It's wonderfull to read how military loves their country and think that violent discipline is THE solution. Heinlein opinion of war is old fashined and fall in the same pit of right wing totalitarism, if you consider the example of nazi idea of military glory and honor. Wake up and read Forever War instead, and learn what a real war is, not a wargame played outside the jungle, only in the mind of the profetic Heinlein..."
1,Just watch the movie,"I have read really awful books in my life (The Hulk movie novelization for instance) and then, I have seen movies that are far worst than the book ever was...Well, there is a first time for everything! Starship Troopers is by far the worst book I have ever read. It is just the constant and incessant rambling -lectures in school, lectures in the academy- of one guy who enters the military in order to become a citizen. How did Verhoeven came up with the script, characters, action and so on, for Starship Troopers Movie? Beats me, it was certainly not this book. If what you liked about the movie was the action packed scenes, stay away from this book (you will only find 3 maybe 4 medium to none action pages in the whole book).I really wanted to get to know the Starship Trooper's characters more, also thought that, almost every time, the book is far better than the movie... this wasn't the case. Trust me guys, watch the movie."
5,Read the book it is not like the movie,"The book and the movie of Starship Troopers share very little, save the name, in common.The movie offers very, very, very little of the rich detail and thought behind this book. The only real ""action"" is in the very first part of this rather short book. Although it may not be ""Atlas Shrugged"" or ""Aria Kalsan"" it has a lot to offer. The rest of the book is a discourse on the nature of citizenship, among other virtues.If you are expecting a bug hunt, look elsewhere. But if you enjoy thinking about and reading different viewpoints then this is the book for you."
5,Heinlein can do no wrong!,"Only my sixth Heinlein novel and I can't believe I haven't rushed out to read all I could get my hands on. I had to read this one BEFORE the movie was released out of fear it would ruin it for me. Troopers was a gem! Far from the standard 'war in space' novels, you don't have to be a military enthusiast to thoroughly enjoy it. Read it, read it now. You'll be entertained from cover to cover.."
3,Let's make sure what we're talking about here.,"I wrote a review in April, which I just reread and discovered I gave Starship Troopers a 10. Surely as the sun will rise over Florida, this book is a 10, but only if only science fiction is considered. Let us not take leave of our senses. It ain't that good. If anyone really wants to know what I consider a 10, let them read All the Pretty Horses by Cormac McCarthy, which is one of the best American novels of the 20th Century and a hell of an adventure tale in its own right. Starship Troopers is ""solid gold Heinlein,"" but I'm downgrading my rating to a 6"
4,"Good book, Bad political philosophy","Starship Troopers was quite interesting, and the action scenes, the relationships between characters, and the powerful descriptions were superb. However, I can niether like nor defend Robert Heinlein's radical political beliefs which he incoporates into the book. The concept of federal service in this oppressive society didn't bother me, but how Heinlein tried to justify it was. He tries to explain that nothing should be free, even basic civil rights, with absurd logic. The corporal punishment idealology and claims that democracy is a poor government were pathetic as well. Then again, Socrates, the well-respected Greek philosopher, thought democracy was a poor government as well, and people still think he was wise, just confused. I feel the same about Heinlein and Starship Troopers. If you can ignore Heinlein's political views, you'll like this book"
5,One of the best military SF novels ever,"First, forget the movie. It's loosely based on the book. How loose? Man fights killer bugs in space. The political scene on Earth, and the *basic* character outlines. That's it. No huge bugs that spit glowing balls of killer goo from their nether-regions. No flying Kamikaze insectoids that decapitate without warning. The movie was fun, but a dim shadow of the book. The movie should have been called ""fashion models in space vs the killer bugs from the belt.""RAH was a master at socio-political setups and the details that make great SF. I find it a little insulting that the publisher slapped a scene from the movie on the cover just to grab more sales - the book can stand on it's own merits! If you are a fan of SF, RAH or future-looking novels of society and war, get this book. It's one of his best!"
2,"Skip it - Read ""Forever War"" or ""Ender's Game"" Instead","I'm a big Heinlein fan but this one was for the dogs - poorly written, with no redeeming values. It's as if Heinlein was able to get away with publishing his first draft. For a FAR BETTER written novels on the same topic, read ""Forever War"", or even better, ""Ender's Game""."
3,I wanted to like this but...,"Starship troopers was somewhat of a dissapointment for me. I can't stand it when authors gratuitously inject their political opinions into their work. This felt more like a political statement and history lesson than a work of fiction.And for those of you looking for the same kind of jaw-dropping action that you witnessed in the movie, look elsewhere. The pace is slow and the battle sequences are sporadic.Although I admire the prodigious talents of this visionary sci-fi author, I could not bring myself to enjoy this book. Even though Starship Troopers won a Hugo Award for best novel back in 1960, it also signified the beginning of Heinlen's decline, a period where he wrote sci-fi novels not for escapism but instead for preaching his political and sociological opinions. For better entertainment value, watch Paul Verhoeven's excellent film adaptation instead. The film is an action classic but the book is not."
3,Starship Troopers,"This book is DEFINATELY not the movie, so if you expect it to be, you will be dissappointed. I found the book readable, but I did not find it engrossing. It is mostly a narrative with little in the way of dialog or interaction between characters. It is written in the first person, and because of that, it seems to dwell almost completely on the main character's experiences with little discription of scenery or other characters. About half way into the work, I found that it did not keep my interest."
4,Just scratches the surface...,"I thought this book was a little superficial in its treatment of the ""Hero"" archetype. Contrary to the first reviewer I would say that this book is anything but rational. The archetypes and myths employed in this book have been examined much more closely by non-fiction authors such as Joseph Campbell, Jung and Freud. Heinlein has just taken an old myth and covered it with a sci-fi veneer. Nevertheless, it is entertaining.For those of you with honorable tendencies I recommend ""Meditations"" by Marcus Aurelius. Aurelius recorded the thoughts collected in this book while on campaign with the Roman legions. He was also emperor at the time. His ideas are morally courageous, well thought and grounded in practical experience."
4,"A remarkable book!,A prescription for healthy society ?","The basic premise of the book, that Military service is the highest moral attitude, is quite acceptable. The sketch of a cadet's impression of military Training, is superbly done, with a careful interweaving of the philosophical foundation. The book can even be set in today's time, and could be called contemporary fiction. a must read for everyone worried about today's tattered social fabric. It is also a gripping story with racy narrative."
3,Typical Heinlein,"Although Starship Troopers contains a good deal of exciting and thoughtful social commentary, at this stage in his career Heinlein is becoming less concerned with telling a good story than with showing the reader how much he knows about this or that. It gets to be tediously sophomoric at times and is a hint of the lets-eat-breakfast-naked-and- bore-ourselves-to-death scenes which infect all of his work subsequent Stranger in a Strange Land. Definitely a book to be read once. But for the ideas and not the story"
3,Not pro-war? Read something else.,"The pro-war philosophy was really, really hard to swallow. It wasn't as bad as say John Wayne in the Green Berets because it was at least well written and postulated. I still wanted to run screaming, but I didn't feel the need to actually throw up. Still, if you didn't want our troops in Iraq and feel that Vietnam was a horrific waste of human potential, you'll definitely want to read something else.If you're looking for a great sci-fi classic by this author, buy Stranger in a Strange Land instead."
4,Starship Troopers,It's a great book for boys and for girls who think like boys.Far far better than the film.
2,Movie was better,"Hard to believe when the movie is generally considered to be campy garbage with a cult following and the book is a sci-fi ""must-read"" but that's how I felt. I don't love the movie but I liked the general idea and was hoping for a more polished story-telling of the key elements of the goofy film. What you get is something much different. There is actually only one encounter with the aliens and it's pretty uneventful. Most of the book is made up of lengthy descriptions of their equipment, troop movements or the details on the inner-workings of the military including lengthy philosophical debates in the form of flashbacks of the hero having discussions with his old high school teacher. It's very dry. It's very boring and I'm glad no one every attempted to make a film true to the novel."
3,If you like black and white movies...,"Really, the only thing that made this marginally enjoyable for me was the knowledge of how old it was, and that it was one of the first such military-space novels. I could easily see where other authors took the outline and ran with it....often improving it a great deal. But this book just felt dated and boring for the most part...if it weren't for the orginality of it at the time it was written, I wouldn't have even given it 3 stars."
2,A poor attempt at classic Sci Fi,"I'm afraid this book is a poor attempt at a sci fi classic. John Steakly's ""Armor"" is the real deal. For sheer thrills and an ""Icant put this book down"" experience, give ""Armor"" a try..."
2,Good thing I'll Be Dead by Then,"The movie coming out, I thought I'd read this. I was dissapointed. Heinlien seems to preach throughtout the book of this ""wonderful"" new nation in which military and brutality is held above all. I got a little sick of Johnnie's one-armed teacher ranting and raving about the weaknesses of the 20th century democracies ""a department of defense never won a war"" and the harsh treatment of military offenders. And there was little character realism. Nearly every line of dialogue dated the book, I found myself imagining characters from 50's sitcoms as the book's characters. Anyway, this is as ok book if you're looking for something different. If you like philosophical looks at people fighting insects, try Ender's Game."
5,Brilliant!,"I have served in the army myself, and I must say that the description of the boot camp in this book is the most precise and close to the reality from what I've read! Extraordinary piece of writing - the movie totally butchered it."
4,Controversy is in the mind of the reader.,"Controversy over Starship Troopers is in the mind of the reader. Heinlein, as he did more forcefully and with greater subtlety in his later work, has injected something for everybody in this work. His feminism--on practical principles, of course--is both condescending and prescient. His militarism is very 1950s, and it is doubtful that he had Viet Nam in mind as he wrote the book, despite fanciful allusion in other reviews to ""tunnel rats"" and so forth. For a contrast, read ""The Green Hills of Earth"" -- perhaps the most revolutionary and anti-militaristic, anti-fascist of the early Heinlein collection. Always a good read."
3,"Not my favorite from RH, but a good read.","While I enjoyed the read, it is not my favorite from Heinlein. What I did find interesting was how rich of a read it was. I was expecting a little more of a detailed account of what the movie portrayed. Come to find out that aside from there being a few characters in the movie that were the same and a couple of ripped lines to justify the name of the movie, the similarity stops there. I was thinking that I was in for more of a story in the book. What it is, is really Heinlein's musings about how the military of the future might look like and provided a character and events to unpack it. It is for this that he was so great as a writer. He thought things through to the nth degree. So it is a worthy read. If you like Heinlein, you will most likely like this. Just don't expect the movie (any of them)."
4,"A rollicking good read, as with most Heinlein, a bit heavy on ideology","If you're interested in sci-fi you pretty much have to read this book, which is in many ways a classic. The world Heinlein creates is instantly recognizable and the entire range of human motivations is on display. Heinlein's libertarian stance shines through as well, but what may seem strange to many modern readers is that this is liberally sprinkled with his belief that the privileges of citizenship should be accorded only to those who have taken personal risk on behalf of the nation."
4,"Entertaining, but...","I guess because of the lofty company with which this book is often placed, my expectations were through the roof. It was an entertaining read, with some thought-provoking commentaries on politics and military, but I found myself wishing for more depth to the characters and plot, along with something that was at least a bit more challenging to read.Certainly a great book, but not all I hoped for."
3,Why the rave reviews?,"Someone above claimed this book was ""action packed"" -- did we read the same book? There's hardly any action, and it seems like the boring details are highlighted more frequently than the ones I cared about. It was more exciting to read John Galt's rants in Atlas Shrugged than it was to read about the line of command in this book.I may have liked this book better if I came in with lower expectations. I really enjoyed the Dune and Ender series, and I thought this book would rank up with them. Not so, unfortunately. I can't say I don't recommend this book, but don't expect excitement and don't expect a hero in the way that most sci-fi books present them."
4,"Well-written Military Sci-Fi Drama, Not Like the Movie","I admit it. I saw the movie first. The book and the movie have a few of the same characters. That is where the similiarity ends.The book is well-written. This makes it an easy read. However, at times it gets a little preachy. Occasionally Heinlein launches into tirades that reflect modern left-wingers' idea that government has to protect us from ourselves. Scary.If you saw the movie, give the book a chance. If nothing else, it should make you ponder what the future holds for military service."
3,Book vs. movie...no contest!,"If you have seen Starship Troopers the movie...then expect this book to be very different and a million times better! The only reason I gave it three stars instead of four is because personally, there was a little too much military description in it for me...but many of the moral arguments and ideas brought up in this book were so interesting that one has to wonder...why isn't the world like this yet?"
4,why I can't find the warranty in the package?,"The shippment arrived very quick, the watch is just the same as I can imagine. It's perfect. However I just can't find the warranty."
5,Baseline Selling,"What a great book! Kurlan goes yard with his ability and willingness to include great lessons from the great selling minds of the past and present. Baseline Selling will provide the reader with a rich history of learning the selling craft and, around that history, create a relevant, effective and very ""sticky"" process that will certainly raise any salesperson's batting average....and aren't history, tradition and the excitement for next season part of why we all love baseball?""Beat the drum and hold the phone"" Baseline Selling is going to ""give this game a ride""!"
5,Great Mental Picture of the Sales Process,"Dave Kurlan provides a great tool for a sales person to quickly identify where their prospect is in the sales cycle / timeline. This book is required reading for my sales people. It helps new sales people learn how to think through the sales cycle in a more clear and healthy way; and it helps seasoned sales people clarify where people actually are in the sales cycle.GREAT BOOK, EASY READ."
4,First Time Sales Manager,At one time in my company I was the only sales person. As the company has grown so have my sales management responsibilities. I now have a team of sales people that I have never managed before this time. My sales coach - John Moore told me to read Baseline Selling and it has really helped me and my team. My thanks to John Moore and Dave Kurlan.
5,The Best Book I Ever Read on Sales,"I buy all the sales books. I'm a sales junky. I didn't expect much from this book but it was the best book on sales ever. I read this book in about 3 hours, had dozens of take aways, I tried a bunch of things right away and they all worked. It was way cool. And I get it. It really is this simple. Great stories too. Buy it. You won't be sorry."
3,feedback,"I thought Baseline Selling was a great book for those interested in an efficient way to become a great sales person. I however found it sometimes a little tedious for the few of us who do not necessarily enjoy baseball. The baseball references were a bit over-the-top at certain times. Overall, if you are a professionnal in sales and wish to improve your skills, this book is definitely for you; and if you enjoy baseball you will like it even more."
5,Baseline Sellling,"Every sales manager committed to creating a No Excuse, high performance sales cultures needs to read this book. There are valuable insights for coaching both the novice salesperson as well as the seasoned professional."
4,Interesting and Insightful Read,"Dave Kurlan's book provided an insightful, helpful, and interesting approach to the world of sales. Unlike previous business books I have read which are often boring and difficult to read, Baseline Selling illustrates its message using the metaphor of baseball and keeps readers engaged. Kurlan outlines the steps to making a successful sale as well as key aspects of the process. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in business and sales."
5,Romance Lover,"I enjoyed reading this book. The Heroine is a young baroness with troubles. Her husband(whom she married in haste yet thinking it was a good idea at the time) left after the wedding, her sister has her eye for an ineligable partner, and her cousin wants her dead! Above all- she worries about her estate and then falls for the Earl who is skeptic of this female who entered into his life- claiming that she is his wife! He vows to help her eventhough he doesn't trust her. I enjoyed it and I read it over and over again."
2,No actual discussion of budgets.,"Even though the description claims that the book provides an in depth look at square footage costs, it does not. Only a few of the houses even mention the square footage and none have information about costs. This was VERY disappointing, as it seemed to be the whole point of the book. I also have to question the position of ""on a budget"" one house, for instance, has an exterior that is clad in raw steel. There is no mention, of course, in what this actually cost, but it would seem not be a ""budget-friendly"" approach. The discussion of ""Keeping costs down"" for each house is a short paragraph, often two sentences. The wood framing has already been mentioned by a reviewer, another favorite of mine is the ability to open the windows allowing ""temperate ocean breezes"" to eliminate the need for air-conditioning. There are a few interesting ideas, and the photography is quite nice, but the book does not come close to providing what it promises."
2,Poor instructions,"The instructions in this book are not clear, the pictures hard to understand, the final project looks good if somebody can do it. Very disappointed."
1,Very disappointing -- This stitch needs a good guide,"Unfortunately, this is a very poor introduction to a difficult but worthwhile stitch. I was tempted to give it two stars out of five because the project designs are mostly quite good (if you can figure them out): in fact the triangular RAW bangle is now one of my favourite patterns. But the frustration I felt while working out how to read the poorly conceived diagrams and obscure written instructions almost led me to toss this book against a wall (and I respect all books too much to do that often!) Beginners, stay away -- instead, buy Bead and Button magazine's 2008 special issue titled _Beading Basics: Right Angle Weave_, or Carol Cypher'sMastering Beadwork: A Comprehensive Guide to Off-loom Techniques. Better still, learn from a tutor and practice a lot. Then you may be able to overcome this book's serious flaws and enjoy what it has to offer."
4,List of lists,"The Order of Things answers thousands of trivia questions and provides an excellent summary starting-point for researchers. Learn the Roman Empirical heirarchy, list the moons of Jupiter by size, or follow the pictorial brewing of beer -- then go to the library and get the details."
4,I've had good experiences with this company,"I'm sorry the other reviewer had a bad experience, but I've been buying La Bouquetiere laundry powder for years, and have never had problems with my orders. Occasionally they'll sell out of something and have to back-order, but they've been good about telling me how long the orders usually take to ship. (Shipping is never especially quick, but they don't promise otherwise.)For best service, I'd suggest going to their web site and calling the store in San Francisco."
2,surround sound,"Lot's of bass, but the speakers cut out or crackle every once in a while, especially when watching a movie, or listening to music. Rear speaker wires are way too short. Not bad for the money, but they could be better."
3,Good for the Price,"Ok my dad really loves music. He has a really great stero system, and when I compared these speakers to his I was blown away. These speakers are good for their price, but compared to my dad's Cambridge SoundWorks Radio CD 740, the clarity of it is just horrible. Though it's not fair to compare my dad's to mine, since his is about four times the price. My PC also has a Audigy 4 soundcard so it should put the speakers to their maximum potential. I'll just go straight to the break-down.ProsCheapStrong baseGreat for listening to Hip-hop and rap. Modern music basically.Gaming is EXCELLENT.ConsClarity is not very goodListening to classical, it just doesn't sound as good as my dad's.Cords are kind of short.Overall it's good, but I just don't like the clarity when compared to my dad's Cambridge."
1,fire hazard,"We purchased this system less than two years ago. It has seen light to moderate use. Several days ago, the speakers started intermittently cutting out. This afternoon, the subwoofer popped several times--then caught fire! Fortunately, my son was able to extinguish the flames before much damage was done. Beware!!!!!"
5,Great sound for the money,Pros -Ease of installationSound QualityPlenty of BaseCorded Remote ControllerCostCons -Corded Remote ControllerYou need a 5.1 capable sound card to enjoy the sound qualityFor the money this is a great system that produces a very clean sound.
4,Logitech Z-5300e - Great for the money!,"These speakers are an excellent buy! You'll want a Creative Audigy2 ZS Sound Card to go with them, to give you true 6-channel sound. Also, you need the Creative software to tweak the tone.You'll calibrate the speakers for 5.1 sound. Then turn the bass all the way down on the Logitech control, & you'll also want to turn it down to 20% on the Surround Mixer. On the Graphic Equalizer you can turn up the 4k to around +4.5db & the 8k up to +12db. Once you make these adjustments, you have an amazing system with the sound of your artist playing loud & clear right in your room! I bought mine directly from Amazon, & I'm very happy with them!"
3,Lots of sound - but a little harsh,"These speakers put out a ton of sound for the price, but are definitely geared more toward gaming and movies than music.The subwoofer is too much for the system and thumps loudly, drowning out the subtleties of some types of music. Of course, you can equalize the sound to your preference, but I found the bass to be overpowering most of the time. If you need some great surround sound speakers for listening to anything at high volumes, these are worth the money, but not that accurate for high-fidelity music."
5,"Good sound, good bass, plenty of power","I got these to replace some old creative 5.1 speakers that were slowly going out on me. The creative had a good run, but this system really caught my eye for the price and power. It was easy to set up, though I was a bit surprised to see RCA connections for everything rather than ye old speaker wire. My only complaint is the front speaker wires are short, but in my mind that's not enough to take away a star over. The sound is crisp, powerful, handles a good range, and they system can get pretty loud. I can only bear it at about 50-60% power depending on what I'm listening to. The bass IS very strong, the sub is a behemoth... but it is adjustable via the controller. And if you're an audiophile you will have EQ software on your computer anyway. More is better than not enough if you're a sound freak like me and tweak the EQ constantly. I'm very happy with it. I plan to use it for a long time, it even looks cool too :)"
4,Great speakers but too much bass,"Absolutely awesome speakers, the sound clarity is amazing for the price. Only issue I have with these speakers is that they have a little *too* much Bass."
2,"Great Sound, Deep bass",Great product for the price. Really liked the external volume control. Bass is serious. Found it difficult to keep under control. RCA speaker cables were too short for me. Think I'm upgrading to the 5500's.
4,Great Product for games,"If you listen to music then you will need to purchase a decent sound card to work with this item, even then the music sounds muddy. But it still works fine.For games and movies it is an amazing system for the price. It is better on games than movies."
3,So So. but you can correct the bass!,"I installed these speakers in a small store I own. The sound was ok, nothing to impress my customers. just Ok.On the other hand, the real problem is that the bass is totally overwhelming, it needs a lot of equalizing!! and the tone is not nice. It is a nightnmare if you want to connect the speakers directly to an MP3 Player, or discman. Impossible to equalize.However, after tolerating them for a while, I found a great remedy. Create a newspaper ball, cover it with masking tape, and put it in the subwoofer air exit!!! Do not stack it totally, otherwise you will kill the bass completely. just insert it to the point it does not move, put more tape to keep it in place or put the subwoofer against the wall, so that the paper ball does not move. After some experimenting I got a deep deep bass without the annoying noise. Delicious bass, I could not believe it. try it!"
2,No way to put the bass level where it must be,"......Of course, by the price I've payed for this item I could not expect to have a Bose quallity sound, but, it has a main problem which is you cannot turn down the bass volume till wherever you want, so it is always a ""Bass Concert"" what you hear; without the posibility, if you want it so, to turn out the bass, or as I wished, to put it's level exactly where I wanted. You could turn it down just till certain point, but even so, the subwoofer sounds over the rest of the speakers. And the rest of the speakers have not a very beautiful sound with an unavoidable excesive middle range frecuence. And what they say about 280 watt, I'd say that they are 270 for the sub and 10 for the rest of the speakers which cords are too short for a home theater."
3,"For $130, not bad... for $200.. look for better monitors","If you have the (...) 22inch monitor with the (...) graphics card and the (...)computer, don't try to look cheap for 'gaming speakers'. I have to admit they are pretty decent but I ended up returning them because I am one of those people and I just thought for (...) less than a similar product, I would try these guyz out.In the end, I think the bass is too muddy, and the sound is a little distorted. The only reason these speakers get loud is because of the wall booming bass. Most basses now can boom your wall down, but none have sounded so muddy as this one did.Pros: Nice aesthetic touch with grills, wires were long enough, cute wired controller, easy to set up, work well with games with the bass on minimum, Amazon rocks.Cons: Not the best for music, Bass is awfully loud even on its quietest setting, bass is not precise, speakers are pretty big, prices are not good enough to buy in stores since returns in stores can be a pain in the butt."
3,Overall average speakers...,"NOT worth the money... as is with most of Logitech's products, in my experience. For how much these were, they should have lasted longer. I never put these things up much more than halfway, and the damn sub blew after 2 weeks. At first, it WAS pretty great bass, though. Then, all the sudden I realized it sounded like garbage. I thought it was due to the placement of the box, but I was wrong. At this point, it was too late and warranty period was over. The rest of the speakers sounded decent, but nothing amazing. I kept them for a while, dealing with the crappy bass and just sucked it up. I'd recommend steering clear of Logitech, unless you really hear good things about the product and have good luck."
4,Good quality with a little drawback,"The price is good enough for these small speakers and can give a very good sound. For now, I can only see 3 disadvantages of the speakers. First, the wires are not long enough so you can mount it on the wall. Second, the sattelite speakers can only swivel about less than 180 degrees on the same side - that is, if you want to mount them on the wall, you can't get the angle that you wanted especially on the right (front and rear) speakers. They should have the right (front and rear) speakers swivel on different direction as the left (front and rear) speakers. Thirdly, a ""wired"" remote control - which is quite inconvinient to have especially if you are watching tv and wanted to adjust the volume. You better adjust the volume before watching a movie or listening to music coz it's quite annoying to stand up and adjust it to the right volume. But with this price, you are certainly getting what you're paying for."
5,"""When I write down anything wicked, one of them look very serious; but the other one, he wink.""","A masterpiece of modern literature.Straight into my top 10 best books ever. From beginning to the end it is clever,funny, sad, easy to read and full of random events that lead the reader to considerdeep ideas about the purpose of life.On page 22 Ebenezer as an old man rememberswhen as young boy he inherits from a relative who had passed away,the two decorative china dogs he still has,""I like my two china dogs. When I write down anything wicked,one of them look very serious; but the other one, he wink.""I had a feeling I would like this book, it's about life on an Island,which is something I identify with having living all my life in Britain and Japan.Also my favourite places are islands: Venice, Malta, Fiji, Rhodes,Capri and the Scottish Islands. Guernsey is next on my list to visit.Shame about the cheap cover art and design. This bookdeserves better."
2,The Book of Ebenezer Le Page,This is an old book which was selected for my Book Club by a member. It is interesting in its description of life on the island of Guernsey over one person's lifetime which spans 2 World Wars and occupation by a foreign country. It is seen as autobiographical but little is actually known about the author who lived much of his life on the island. I would not have known about or read this book if it hadn't been for the Book Club. It is written well but I did not find it overly interesting.
2,A contrary opinion,"My inability to leap on this bandwagon of fireworks distresses me. But, in all good faith, I cannot.After plodding through almost 70 pages of this novel, I have ground to a halt. I simply cannot take it anymore. There has been only one book of G.B. Edwards published. There is a reason for this: He plods. Yes, he does.It was rejected for publication numerous times, and why was that? Right. He plods.Maybe it livened up after the 70th page. I hope so, but I lacked the spirit to carry on. There are other books, better books, awaiting.If you are interested in an old man's memories of Guernsey island life, an old man who speaks as if he never finished high school, well, perhaps this will captivate you. It did not captivate me. After 70 pages, I said to myself: So what? Do I care? The answer was a resounding no.Another reviewer noted that it was slow going at first. But 70 pages? We should have been up to speed by 70 pages. But we were still idling."
5,One of the best books I've ever read.,"A story of life on the Channel Islands between the late l9th century and the l960's; a story of family, of love and hate, of joy and sorrow, seen through the eyes of a now old man, told with insightfulness and simplicity. A classic."
5,Don not miss this beautiful novel,"This is a gorgeous novel, not to be missed. My 1981 Knopf edition has a superb introduction by John Fowles, and all editions include a glossary of Guernsey's French patrois. One of my all time favorites, and I have given it to many friends who also consider it a gem."
5,There's hope for humanity after all....,"This is probably one of PKD's easiest reads, so save it for the day when you don't want to confront life's difficulties.... despite all the problems the characters face, there is a happy, almost upbeat, ending (well, as happy as any of his novels gets). The writing/theme/characters/etc reflect as usual his alternative approach, which may not appeal to all readers. But for me, a dedicated reader and fan since the 60's (starting with The Game Players of Titan at age 12?), this book represents the apex of classic ""After-the-Apocalypse"" novels about realistic (as opposed to ""Garden-of-Eden"") human survial, plus the good guys win and the bad guys don't. What more could you want? I really recommend you add this book to your PKD collection as light relief to some of the heavier stuff eg A Scanner Darkly."
5,one of many masterpeices by a scifi god,"PKD is an insanely genius writer. I've read almost 20 of his books since discovering him just about a year and a half ago, and this was one of my favorites. You should probably read some of his more well known books before you get to this one though. To someone just getting into Dick, I'd suggest reading Ubik, The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, or Do Android Dream of Electric Sleep before reading this or any of his less well known classics."
4,the perfect Philip K. Dick book for beginners...,"Philip K. Dick (PKD) is known for writing very clever, often times too clever, science fiction novels. I find his work to be engaging even when he really goes off wild tangents, mostly because I'm in awe of his creative mind. He also is very good storyteller.Dr. Bloodmoney is non-standard PKD material in that it is extremely readable and, surprise!, understandable. It is a rather curious story of survival in the bizarre, mutant-rich world of post-WWW III (nuclear war) San Francisco bay area. Yes, there are weird creatures and a fair amount of metaphysical shenanigans (..PKD trademarks). But PKD is remarkably controlled in telling this story, and it scores well on the believability index.Bottom line: Philip K. Dick goodness in controlled, measured doses. Certainly not his most creative work, but perhaps his most accessible. Recommended."
5,Beast Wars takes transformers to new level.,"If you are a hard-core fan of Transformers or just enjoyed the first season of Beast Wars, then you'll love the second season. The plot quickens and focuses in these seven episodes, reaching a cliff-hanging finale that ties the Beast Wars to the original Generation One Transformers. The intricate way that the story develops and the nearly flawless animation (steps above the first season) drew me in when I first saw the origianl airings and convinced me that the Beast Wars incarnation was more than a creative spin-off using the 'Transformers' name. I'm pretty picky about which of the many variations of Transformers storylines I choose to follow, and I think this is one of the best.To be fair, there's not much in the way of 'special features', but that doesn't detract much from the value of this collection."
5,Saturday morning is fun again,the cartoon expands on the Transformers story.and has very good computer generated animationI remembered this cartoon being on early on Saturdays..and given the crap that's on now.. I just throw this in instead
3,beast wars,"not exacty what i remember watching as a child early in the morning, but i brought all three season and have watch them a few time, this beast machine, which people tell me are the next lot continue from beast wars. i find is completey stupied and is not recomended if you enjoy the beast wars."
4,good,little bit different than the first season but it is good. I like the new metal characters in season two
2,Some problems,"The last scene on Coming of the Fuzors Part II was unreadable - ditigal garbage. Has anyone else had this problem?No extras this time. Oh well.No convenient menu selection to access separate episodes. Episode pages are chained together. Accessing later episodes requires first going through the pages for each episode before it on that disk. Very awkward; I have never seen it done that way.Great episodes tho, when they're readable."
5,YES!!,i remember this great show! i watched season 1 back in 7th grade every morning! then when i started 8th grade season 2 started.. it was only on once a week now but man was it good. i never really was into transformers as a kid but i loved this show. its only 13 episodes but this is the best season in my view. i still remember back when cartoon network had the week of new episodes... ah the good ol days
5,The Best of the Beast,"This is a true delight to anyone who ownes a DVD player. The first season was still in its experimental stages. Now, the show has matured due to a darker tone, more action, and the emphasis on the personalies of the characters.Season highlights:Some of the transformers recieve new ""transmetal"" bodies.Fuzors are introduced.A certain maximal general is revived.The episodes ""Code of Hero"" and ""Transmutate."" Oh yeah!And a shocking conclusion that changes the entire Transformers universe!"
3,what is that song?,"I believe that this album has it's share of good tracks. The way he express reality realy makes that person think on life. I'm not sure if I can remember correctly,but there is a song on one of his albums that I liked. I can't remember what the title is, but I do remember that in the chorus he says: ""this is the days of old"". If there are any one out there that knows what I am looking for please mail me & let me know... Thanks!"
4,Now a Must Have,"Just read this morning that Paris was shot and killed. Came here to check out the artist, because I'd never heard of him. What a shame; this is a must have for the collection."
5,Paris' music,"When I first heard this record, specifically the song ""Break the Grip of Shame"" it really woke up a cultural consciousness in me. It touched something primal in me that I belonged to a culture that wasn't just American, but older than America. I felt that I could actually take on the world and WIN! It mobilized in me a sense that my culture wasn't something that was born from the marketing halls of Nike, Addidas and (at the time) Cross Colors and Karl Kani. Paris music does that to a person, points them in a direction where the injustices really are, and ironically, not all of which are of the Black/White dynamic.That was 15 years ago. Because of Paris' music, and people like him, I have taken upon myself to address ALL the injustices in the world, not just those of racism, and confront those responsible for it to change. You'll never get that kind of anger and willingness to right wrongs listening to anything Murder Inc., Cash Money or Aftermath puts out."
5,MMC is the greatest!,I used to watch this show when I was like 3 or 4 years old and I remember really liking it! Little did I know that I would be the biggest Nsync fan 10 years later!I just wish they would put out a video tape of it. It would be cool to have!
4,Brings back Memories,"My sister had bought this album for me while she was in Disney back in 1993. I must have listened to this CD thousands of times. While moving it was somehow lost and I have been trying to find it for some time. Would reccommend this to anyone, great tracks and an abundance of talent."
5,Guilty Pleasure,"Okay, I'll admitt it! I was a fan of MMC! I really loved ""Hanging on for dear life"" the best. My mother worked for target and They toured to all the Targets. I got to meet all of them and got their autographs. Britney Spears was there to, before she became a star, Unfortantly I didn't get her autograph because she wasn't in the group. I met her upstairs at the Farmington Hills Michigan Target. Overall I loved MMC the show and the Music Group! I also liked ""the Party""!"
5,JC AND THE MMC ROCK!,"The CD is so good! I especially like the songs JC sings lead in: ""I Saw Her First"" and ""Let's Get it Together."" The CD is up beat and has a nice blend of vocies. Write me if you are interested in the CD. I can't believe they took it off the market."
1,Mickey Mouse Club not for families anymore,"This latest group to bear the name Mickey Mouse Club does not, unfortunately, keep in line with the traditional Disney values of families and ""small"" children. My own children are not permitted to watch the Mickey Mouse Club anymore. The addition of rap style music only proves that the club is targeting a teenage audience EXCLUSIVELY. I only gave it 1 star because that is the lowest score available. I'll stick to showing my kids tapes of the original club."
1,a disappointment,"i read the boy from the burren.then i reread it. about six times. i love that book. they characters are so different from one another and so life-like, the story is compelling and non-formulaic. i've read a LOT of fantasy, so stuff that follows too much of a pattern is boring to me. the boy from the burren was a welcome change. so i went searching for anything else i could fine by the author.this was a mistake.i'm still willing to check out the other books of the painter, but man has sheila improved as a writer since she started! this book and it's sequals are everything that is boring to me about fantasy. solutions to problems get found too easily, characters personalities never really get flushed out. this book was an utter disappointment."
5,Great For Sensitive Skin - Highly Recommended,"My wound care provider uses these as mesh barrier layer on my hard to heal skin ulcers and I have been very pleased with how well they protect my wound without causing skin irritation. I have incredibility sensitive skin and react badly to most dressings and adhesives but this works very well, as does the similarJohnson & Johnson Adaptic Non-Stick Dressings (3 x 3-Inch), 12-Count Dressings (Pack of 2).These have made a significant difference in my wound care treatment, and I am thankful that my insurance covers them!Highly Recommended!CFH"
5,At last...,"Now, I love Transformers. I'm 16, and I just recently got completely into TF's in time for the Energon series. By the way, cool toys, bad show. Anyway, the first transformer I bought was energon Scorponok. Through all the rest of the energon line, he stayed my top favorite.And now he's back with a vengeance! An awesome mold, now with some righteous colors and a cyber key thrown in for good measure.The Scorponok mold is one of the most durable is existence. (Those of you with any vintage G1 toys that are still holding together, forgive me) Though I bought him first, he's still in the best shape. The mold is cool beyond comparison, except for a little lacking in the arm/shoulder poseability.But he's got three modes, all of which are awesome. He is also the only transformer I have yet discovered that has a minicon peg, an energon star holder, and a cyber key thingy.Anyway, he's righteously awesome. Thanks for reading."
2,Happiness Runs let it get away,"I bought this because I am a Kevin Gage fan. He is in this movie for about 30 seconds. The concept is fair but the way this is scripted is bad. It's like a joke about how wrong a commune can go from it's origional intent. Weaving in Vermont, getting high, peace and free love man."
4,"still the best studio recording of ""La Traviata""","Get the full set, because this is simply the best complete studio recording of ""La Traviata"". The 3 ""giants"" (Scotto, Kraus, Bruson) all have many years of stage experience in their respective roles and transform the performance into a real theater experience. Kraus and Bruson are excellent as always, and much better than the partners of the younger Scotto on the recording directed by Votto. The recording was made in the late 70's (early 80's ?), so one should be aware of the condition of Scotto's voice at this late stage of her career, but the prima donna's musicality and artistry compensate greatly for any vocal frailty. Forget the ""lovely"" Cotrubas, Studer, Gheorghiu : Scotto's Violetta is flesh and blood and will really bring tears to your eyes."
4,Famous Murder Cases of the Great Pathologist,"Observations such as the ones depicted in this book were the stuff of daily routine for Bernard Spilsbury, the man who dominated the field of criminal pathology in Britain for nearly half a century. This official biography is both an absorbing record of some of the most gruesome of the twentieth-century killings, and a fascinating insight into the psychology of a man whose metier was murder.Written with full access to his official and personal papers, this detailed study of Spilsbury the man, and Spilsbury the pathologist, must rank among the most important and valuable works on the most macabre side of crime.No one man has done more to further the prestige of forensic medicine and its application to law in the criminal courts.But such was his life, living with the horrors and tragedies of others, that he became a man obsessed with his own unhappiness: in December 1947 he took his own life."
5,Great Flag & University,"Works every game day, best to take it down between events, well made and will last a long time, for sure."
3,Reverse side of flag is upside down,This flag is nicely made and has great vibrant colors but the sides are not identical. One side of the flag has the Florida on the bottom and upside down.
3,Better than a stock seat,"The pad helps a little. It's good quality but not too thick. The stock seat would kill me after about 45 minutes, now it kills me after about an hour and a half. I wish it was a little cheaper for what little more comfort you get. If you want good comfort you have to drop the money on a new seat, but those are at least 4 times the price of this pad. If you want a temporary solution and are low on funds buy this pad. But know that eventually you're going to buy a new seat."
5,Their Best - But Least Known,"This beauty became obscure soon after it was first released on LP. Less than 2 years after its release, it was deleted from Ampex Records catalog. I had just discovered Come and Gone, and wanted more, so you can imagine my delight when i stumbled across a lone copy in a cut-out bin in '74. This quickly became my favorite Proffit record, and it remains that to this day. In fact, it is one of the most prized CD's in my collection. This album has the best songwriting, just the right amount of production polish, and it packs an emotional wallop. It was the last truly honest effort before going in a more commercial direction with Rockfish Crossing and Bareback Rider."
2,Disappointing,"After having been a big fan of the Come & Gone double album for years (I have both the vinyl and the CD) and having heard great things about this album, I was disappointed when I finally heard it. It has none of the strong song writing, deep and politically provoking lyrics, original and heart-felt melodies of Come & Gone. Instead it sounds like a band that had fallen apart and run out of ideas. There's almost a thrown together feel about it, as if they were in a hurry to get the album out of the way just to fulfill a recording contract. If you are new to Mason Proffit, avoid this and pick up Come & Gone to hear some of the best country rock ever recorded, not to mention some of the best song writing ever. For completists only."
3,Not my favorite,"I've been a huge Mason Proffit fan since the early 70's and was happy when their work was reissued on CD since my LPs were worn. Unfortunately, this album is my least favorite. For whatever reason, the melodies, lyrics and harmonies just don't hit me the way their other albums do. Try the others first. You won't be disappointed!"
3,IT'S OK... for now,"I purchased this product about a week ago. I cant say it has made a difference yet (atleast not on my dark circles), but I can definitely see a difference on my cheeks, (which have a little bit of red acne marks). It made my cheeks more even toned and the redness subsided. Ive been putting this cream on my dark circles since then (twice a day) but still hasnt ""WOW'd"" me. I guess I need to wait a little longer since it says I have to wait a few weeks to see significant improvement. So far, I like it. Smells good, kind of weird at first, but it isnt so bad... oh and it made my skin a little dry, though its not really much of my concern because I use Purpose moisturizer. overall, swansons vitamin k cream is a good product. i will update once my dark circles become lighter and brighter. :D this is also good under make up."
4,VITAMIN K EYE CREAM,DOES HELP DARK CIRCLES BUT I DO HAVE HEALTH PROBLEMS PROBLY IF I DIDNT IT WOULD REALLY WORK FAST BUT IT DOES WORK
1,Skip it,"The product did not seem to do anything except make my money disappear. The cream was refreshing when you first put it on, but that is all that I could see."
4,Works for spider veins,"I didn't really notice any improvement in the minor dark circles under my eyes, but after about a month of daily use I have definitely noticed a significant improvement around my ankles where I used the cream to treat spider veins. I'm ordering more to see if the improvement continues."
3,I Always Commit Salvation Armani,"I bought this book on Amazon, used, and am glad I didn't pay full price. While it had some funny points (I especially liked the glossary of terms, particularly 'Salvation Armani') I was hoping for more useful advice, not simply ""save money on furniture by inheriting items from your parents."" It's also a 'read once, file away the knowledge and pass on the book' type of read, and a quick one at that."
2,"Clever Idea, Poor Effort","This book was generally on target: it captures the perspective of a poor 20-something craving style and luxury. It has some witty comments as well as a couple of interesting hints for this decadent group of people. However, while the first pages were interesting, I found the book ran out of steam quickly. Dopey quizzes and contrived anecdotes comprise the bulk of the book, and though it tries to pose as a manual for all stylish college grads, it is geared primarily towards females."
2,Making a farce out of financing,"Though this book is written in a funny manner and does have some helpful hints, it is all commen sense and invites some dangerous ideas. The ideas of over using your expense accounts, taking advantage of friends and abundant use of credit cards is by no means a way of saving money or using it wisely."
2,What it boils down to: have rich friends and mooch off of them,"Found this book at a garage sale and bought it hoping for advice about how to enjoy life during that stressed-out period after graduation. Mostly it seemed like a repository for cutesy catchphrases that I'm sure wowed the author's friends at various keggers. Also, the advice was pretty superficial. I give it credit for being moderately well-written."
2,Eh...,"This was a little far-fetched and didn't really apply to my style of living a whole lot. I'm cheap... truly, and this book seemed to just be giving me ideas of how to spend more money on crap I don't need or do in the first place. It seemed to be written by girls in their late teens/early 20's (which I'm a girl in 20's, but don't care about getting gaudy) and was just to pop-culture young woman-y for me. I fit the age group, but don't really fit the dopey materialistic thinking that I think is kind of ironic to be in a book about frugality. Be frugal and save yourself the money of buying this book... there are better books out there."
1,bunch of wankers,"in Australia we refer to authors like this as a bunch of wankers.who wants to accumuluate serious credit card debt just to look good at this level?As for heroin chic - get real, get a life."
1,not sure if its even safe,"this product didn't come sealed, I thought it was the law to seal all drug bottles including supplements. I tired a little of it (even though I shouldn't have, but I couldn't even drink it because it was so sour tasting. If I die it's because this product poisoned me. I'm not happy at all. cannot even use it because I'm too scared to. what a waste of money."
1,way too sweet,"This product has stevia in it. It is way too sweet. I would prefer to sweeten to taste, but here you have no choice. Yuck."
3,Worked great for a while,"I bought this camera a couple of years ago and it worked great and took great pictures until recently. First, it started to delay when taking pictures. I had to wait longer and longer, it seemed, each time I tried to take another picture. Then, I was rewinding the film that contained pictures of our son's first Christmas and the film got stuck in the camera. There is no forcing the film compartment door open and I stripped the gears on the door opener when I tried to pry it open. I ended taking it to a professional photo repair shop and spent $15 to have the camera taken apart around the film to save the pictures. I had to buy a new camera because this one is now worthless."
2,Cheap,"Duran,Duran had some cuts back in the day&they were more of a singles Act but they had there moments.but as this album points out&shows there material was better suited to the studio.this new version doesn't make the album any better than it was&also comes off cheap&contrived trying to Manipulate the 20nth year of this set."
1,A CRAPPY LIVE ALBUM,DONT BUY THIS HORRIBLE ALBUM.IT IS'NT LIVE AT ALL.IT IS MADE IN THE STUDIO WITH SPECTATOR VOICES ADDED ON TO THE MUSIC.ZERO STARS.GET FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE FROM PETER FRAMPTON INSTEAD.
2,"If You're Gonna Make a 'Live Album', It Better Be Good","I like Duran Duran. I like the flavour of the 80's. I've seen them 'live' and they are wonderful. But this album stinks. Poor production, obvious over-dubbing, no 'live' feel. This should never have seen the light of day but then again, when a band are on a roll, it's the moneymen that pull the strings...I am sure that Simon and the boys look back now with regret...I gave it a 2** purely for the songs..."
3,"No one loves this band more than I, but...","I've seen them live twice (during the 7 and the Ragged Tiger tour, and just this fall), and to be honest they are better live than this album suggests. As a kid I bought copies of this album to give as Xmas gifts to my best friends and we couldn't believe how much better they sounded when we saw them. My suggestion, rather than buying this album, make sure you have good copies of Duran Duran, Rio, and 7 and the Ragged Tiger, then, treat yourself and go see them live. You'll see what I mean."
4,Sing Blue Silver,If you're into this album at all you should hunt down Sing Blue Silver. That video was shot during this tour and with the exception of the little crying girls is incredible. Wild Boys was a huge hit off this record which I thought was overhyped for the actual quality of the song.
5,Best of the Best 80's,I used to sit by the river and listen to this album for hours back in high school. That was my leisure time...not doing drugs and underage drinking.
1,... this is a live show?!?!?!,"The following review of ""Arena"" by Duran Duran will add some corrections to my review as well as correct Annie from Philadelphia. First of all, despite how you argued in your review, this is NOT a live show. You cannot hear the interaction between Simon and the audience (like you can on ""Two For The Show""). This IS Capitol's sorry excuse for a live album. Also, despite what I documented in my original review, Capitol left off more songs than the two I had mentioned; besides ""Of Crime And Passion"" and ""(I'm Looking For) Cracks In The Pavement"", two more songs, ""Friends Of Mine"" and ""My Own Way"" were also excluded from this so-called ""live"" recording. So, although Simon's singing is, as always superb, and the band plays brilliantly, I cannot grace this recording with anymore than the the one star I originally gave it."
3,Almost live!,"Ok...I admit it. I was a Duran-a-holic in the eighties. This live album only made me salivate all the more. Though I never was interested in the way they looked, I did like their musical stylings (though they were best as ARCADIA). The Wild Boys was an unusual song for Duran Duran, but I liked it (and was the only studio track on this album). These ""live"" versions of their hits are more charged than the studio versions, but the album is ultimately a rehashing of previous hits with one solitary ""new"" track."
3,Practice Boys Practice,"As almost anyone will tell you, the weak point in this album is Simon Le Bon's less-than-ideal singing (check out the opening to ""Is There Something..."" for a quick point of reference). In his defense, his singing has improved dramatically in concert since this album. The one studio track, ""Wild Boys"", is musically interesting and busy enough to keep you from noticing how obtuse the lyrics are (who are these wild boys?). A decent live effort, but if you're looking to start buying Duran Duran efforts, start elsewhere."
2,The engineer should be shot...,"This is the live album that sounds like anything but. Cool arrangements and drama on some of the songs, like ""The Chauffeur,"" but when I buy a LIVE album, I do so to get into the excitement of the crowd. Here.. it's just a hiss. Also, would have been better had the concert not been chopped up. Catch ""As The Lights Go Down,"" or better yet, buy a ticket to a live show instead."
2,Lackluster Live Album from Duran Duran.,"In the classic sense, this is a very mediocre live album by Duran Duran. Many fans get irked by that statement, but it's the sad and honest truth. In 1984, when Duran Duran peaked in popularity, Capitol dropped this record instead of a studio LP to capitalize on the band's popularity. While the material here isn't terrible, performances of ""New Religion,"" ""Is There Something I Should Know,"" and ""Union of the Snake"" come across as perfunctory at best. Simon LeBon sings off-key one time too many, and the band members Nick Rhodes, John Taylor, Roger Taylor, and Andy Taylor perform with a clean efficency that strips the performances of any spontaneity. The only half-worthwhile track is a song that isn't even live: the killer studio cut ""Wild Boys,"" which went to Number Two in the fall/winter of 1984. Take it from a fan of this group: skip ""Arena"" and leave it for the diehards and completists. Duran Duran's studio albums are way better than this."
5,"Perfect for the student, designer and homeowner!","Whether one is studying architecture for the beauty and style of design or as a career, Inside the Bungalow provides a great overview of styles and techniques as well as history. A textbook for those who are seeking a career in interior design or restoration. The beauty of the photography and insight of both the author and the photographer into the feeling and warmth portrayed by each individual home's interior style and visual statement is amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed just browsing through the pages and while there, learned more than I had expected about the importance of the bungalow in America's history. Although this might well be a coffee table book, it is more importantly an accurate and informative study for those who follow this architectural style and are enamored by its colorful history."
4,"Inspiring ideas, very pure to the craftman age","The writing in the book is a little prosaic and doesn't add a ton, but the pictures are really inspiring. Almost of the images are of careful restorations that brought rooms back to their original style. It's a little over the top, but for someone planning a renovation or interested in these houses, it's nice to really understand the original intent of the arts and crafts movement."
5,Super enjoyable again and again like all of their others!,"Great book, lots of advertising and great photos, before and after photos. Fun to read."
5,IVANHOE DVD,"I enjoyed this video when it was first out on Public Broadcasting and was glad to see it on DVD. It's a great interpretation of Sir Walter Scott's classic story of knights and social mores of the Middle Ages. Anthony Andrews was my favorite then and with this new DVD, it brings the story back to life. For those who like the classics told in a way that relates the time that era, they would enjoy this tale very much."
5,The 1982 Ivanhoe Movie - Very Well Done,"For one whom has read the book, the movie captures the essence of the story - chivalry, romance, prejudice, and action. The actors in the movie did an excellent job. The character Ivanhoe was well portrayed and the relationship between Rebecca and Ivanhoe was well developed and believable. The movie addressed all the key activities within the book and succeeded in presenting the story without the audience feeling like the story was being rush.The down side is that the movie may only be available in a VHS version. VHS does have a tendency to age and the clearness of the video and audio may be affected. It would be nice to have a DVD version of the movie available. Even though the movie may only be available in a VHS version -the positive aspects of the movie outlined above still result in this movie receiving a highly positive recommendation for purchase."
5,DVD Please!,"I am in love with Ivanhoe, both the movie and the character played by the talented (and dreamily chivalrous) Anthony Andrews! This is one of the best tv miniseries EVER, and I've watched many! I really really want this to be released on DVD so that I can buy one for myself and my mom and recommend it to everyone I know!"
1,Waste of Time ):,"Sorry to say it, but in my opinion, this movie is very substandard. I wonder that so many indicate they like this film. To me, all the actors seem to be 'acting' like they are acting -- I felt like I was watching an amateur play. The costumes are very distracting because they are so cheesy looking.Due to bad acting, amateurish camera work, strange music, and shabby costumes, I didn't enjoy one moment of it."
2,"Flat, Boring, Disappointing","This version of Ivanhoe is flat and boring. The love between Rowena and Ivanhoe is barely mentioned, in fact Anthony Andrews flat character rarely shows up in the film.The movie has been politicized...apparently the writers were more concerned with using the characters of Isaac and Rebecca to portray jews as superior and Christians asinferior and barbaric (this theme appears many times throughout the movie) than making a good film.The Robert Taylor version of this movie is MUCH better if what you want is a good swashbuckling yarn true to Sir Walter Scott's original Ivanhoe."
2,Oh Sir Walter,"Hard to know why this got so many good ratings, it is really awful. The only good thing are the jousts, which are fun. Everyone else overacts, and the whole thing is totally implausible. Antony Andrews is a cold fish, and Lysette Anthony is absurd, a painted doll with bad hair. Of course the main fault is with Sir Walter Scott, the whole plot is such a crazy quilt. James Mason and Olivia Hussey (So that's what happened to her) with ridiculous accents.It is hard to say this, but the Robert Taylor version is better. Of course Elizabeth Taylor was the most beautiful Jewess in history.Somebody, someday may point out to someone that synthetic colours were invented in the 19th century."
2,so-so adaption,"I read the novel Ivanhoe several times as an adult and i horoughly enjoy each time i pick it up to read it. so, I bought this film from a video store thiking it would be faithful to the book. But, the first part of the book is missing. for example, in the novel, there is a tense dinner scene in which Sir Brian and a monk of the catholic church mak their way to the house of cedric. It is here that we find out that ivanhoe is back from the crusades, but is in full desguise and the lady rowena is betrothed to a saxon lord. It is here, too, the sir brisn is attrzcted to rowena. and there are a few other details tha are missing from the novel that should have made it into ther film. But, it is still entertaining."
1,No Captions!,"If anyone who has ever known a person, or is Deaf knows the hardship there is in finding a GOOD captioned movie. I can only begin to express my vexation on this account. I more specificly want to complain that this movie was NOT captioned! I am so dissappionted as I understand that this is the only Ivanhoe movie that was worthy to bear the name. To discover one afternoon that I was unable to watch it, has made me a very dissappionted fan."
5,Everything you could want from an Aznavour collection.,"In French, that is. This doesn't include any of the English-language versions of his classics, but is otherwise an excellent overview of his 40+ year career. And even though my French is entry-level at best, I prefer to hear Aznavour in his native tongue."
1,Extremely Disappointed!,"The title for this collection ""Platinum Collection-Spanish Version"" is a misrepresentation. It is not even a ""half-truth,"" more like a ""one-third truth.""Of the three CDs in the set, only the first CD contains songs sung inSpanish. The songs in the other two CDs are sung in French. I ordered this set because I thought I could finally get a complete set of his songs sung in Spanish. This is not it. The first CD is a recompilation of songs sung in Spanish that are readily available in various compilations as a single CD--at a much cheaper cost.Part of the problem for the unwary buyer is that the information for this set did not, and still does not, set forth the tracks on each CD so there was no way of knowing that two-thirds of the recordings were in French."
4,Jess Jumps On The 'Emmanuelle' Bandwagon...,"Capitalizing on whatever movie was reeling in the exploitation cash in the 70's/80's, Jess Franco mined the 'Emmanuelle' franchise this time, but the results aren't as embarassing as most of his other works from this period. I know that`s not sounding like a glowing review, but if you`ve seen as many films of his as I have, it`s high praise indeed. And if you`re a fan of Vicky Adams (she was in Franco`s 'Voodoo Passion'), you`re in for a treat. There's the obligatory lesbian trysts, strippers, mediterranean resorts, sapphic-scissoring, seductions, brutality and beyond. The film itself is another re-tread of the series and a host of other Franco flix, but the Eurosleaze quotient is high, the babes are easy on the eyes, the nudity festive and frequent - what else do you want from a film like this, a coherent storyline? Please..."
2,Unsteady mount on Aquapod; poor stock bulb,"I purchased this light as a replacement for stock lighting on a 12g Aquapod.The mounting clamp seemed very unsteady when attached to the back of the tank, and the adjustment knobs always seemed to be almost ready to release.The Viper may work well for other types of tanks, but I don't think it works well for the 12g Aquapod.Also, the stock lighting was very dim. It was more of a blue, than bright white. I was told by JBJ that the bulb needed a burn-in period before it turned bright white, but I returned the Viper after a few days.I thought it was a great concept, but I can't recommend it because of the clamp and stock lamp."
2,OVERRATED,"This movie is so overrated by everybody! It feels like everybody likes it cause it is the cky-guys in it. I mean what's so good about it? They're really bad actors and manuscript isn't that good either! I actually thought this movie was boring like 80% of it, the rest was just a little funny! And there was not much of the jackass ""stunts"" as I was hoping. But if you love the cky-stuff you might like it anyway?!"
4,A really good film,this was a really good movie it was a great change of pace from cky. all the people in it are funny as hell especially brandon. also the music videos kick ass i must have watched the him one about 30 times. the only downer is the moive does get kind o corny at times.
4,Weird and Funny,This movie pretty much gives you a view into Bam's mind. The view is really messed up. It has ups and downs thru the whole movie sometimes it was pretty gay. However the funny parts will have you crying. The end chase sequence is really well done and Bran's characters crack me up. I would recommend this if you like Bam's style of humor. It is however nothing like CKY or Jackass.
2,waste,"If your into weak, typical storylines, and bad acting go ahead and buy it. What happened to the good old toy machine days with these guys. Bam is trying pretty hard to sell-out, maybe he'll be the next chad muska."
2,So BAD,"I bought this DVD, being a big Bam/Jackass fan...and boy, was I disappointed. There are times when the writers of this film take it too seriously, and times when they don't take it seriously enough. It was kind of all over the place for me. I think the guys should just stick with what they do best and not try to seem so ""deep""."
2,My Husband Loves This Movie (Ick),"I can't stand Bam. This movie is so obnoxious & ridiculous. My husband says he loves this movie more & more each time, but I find myself cringing everytime he chooses it for a date night movie. Only watch it if you like Bam."
2,They Are Not Actors!!,"Let me start by saying that I love CKY and Jackass. Bam is a personal hero and his troop always cracks me up, but I didn't laugh at all watching this movie. I watched it twice and never laughed once. The acting is very weak! It feels like CKY wihtout any of the spontaneous creativity. It's not unbearable to watch, but it was way below my expectations. I had total faith that the CKY group could make an awesome movie, but acting and screenwriting is tougher than it looks. The camera work is very impressive!"
2,Low brow juvenile and unfunny,I watched this movie on the strength of other reviews that rated it highly. I should have read more closely and paid attention to the Jackass connection. If you like Jackass you'll probably like this but who likes Jackass except jackasses.The 'entertaining' bits include (...) the main character is stabbed in the eye with a fork and another hilarious piece has an unknown bit actor laughing histerically at absolutely nothing. If this sounds good to you then go for it and get the movie.On the other hand if this sounds like juvenile humour aimed at immature boys between 12 and 16 and you're not in that group then my advice is to avoid this movie and rent something that at least has entertainment value. This movie has no value at all.
1,this is really nasty,I purchased this movie for my son who is 15 years old. I did not look carefully at the parental advisory for explicit content. It is just like porn and not for younger viewers. I'm so sorry to have purchased it. I only put one star on the rating because the computer needed me to fill in the blank.
5,Haggard Review,"God, this movie was even funnier than I expected. Brandon Dicamillo gives a hilarious performance as Falcone, along with several other characters he plays as well. Raab Himself also kept me laughing as Falcone's slightly retarded cousin. I think anyone who saw this could tell you that the funniest actor in the whole film had to be Hanna, who also happened to be running the sound department in the film. He didn't have much of a part, but when he did (laughing hysterically at Dunn, getting way too excited over Double Dragon, and playing the bongos at the speakeasy), he was funny as hell. The special features were great too. You get an inside look at the making of Haggard, Dico's Chinese Freestyle #2, cKy's ""Attached at the Hip"" video, and Bam's cut of ""Heartache Every Moment"" by HIM. Plus, you get to see Jenn Rivell (Bam's ex) topless a couple of times. What more could you ask for? A hairy metalhead named Hellboy? Well, it's got that too!"
4,Don Vito for President!!,"Don Vito in a toga..that right there is worth the cost of admission. He is pretty freaking hilarious. If you are into Bam and his crew and their crude kind of humor, you'll love Haggard. If you don't care for CKY/Jackass/Viva La Bam.. or maybe if you've been in a cave somewhere or something and have never even heard of them..this probably isn't the movie for you. But the rest of you I guarantee will want to watch Haggard more than once. It is laugh out loud funny. There's one part where Ryan's in the bathroom that'll make you pee your pants it's so insane. While the movie won't win any academy awards..it was pretty well done. The acting was actually really good...especially Ryan as the depressed guy..and Raab as this sort of retard who Bam can't stand. Bam is kind of just himself..but that's good. Rent it..buy it..you won't be sorry."
3,It's ok,I bought this dvd because I am a Bam fan. It's a cheaply made movie with all of Bam's friends in it. I thought it could've been a little bit better. It was ok.
5,Cult Classic!,"My boys LOVE this movie! They can probably quote the entire script in their sleep, voices and all!"
4,Haggard,"This is a great movie, and a crass movie. So it is a wonderful movie. Better than one might expect from the likes of Bam Margera and Brandon DiCamillo. Who are talented gentlemen. I'd recommend it to anybody except my Mother."
3,i'd say you'll either love it or hate it,"you'll love it if you love the cky movies, but its different than those. if youre not into that humor, than you'll hate it. this movie is definitely unlike one i've seen. its very well shot and the acting is surprisingly good. its kinda like a full length movie you and youre friends would make if you had the budget and the know how. its got good extras too, so id say if you like their other work, youll want this."
1,Not my style of jewelry,"I do NOT like this book at all - I think the designs are not attractive at all! They look junky and have no symmetry. It's definitely an individual's taste of style. Not worth it at all, in my opinion, and I wish I did not buy it! I won't be making any designs from this book, and will not be picking up any ideas etiher!"
3,You down wit' O.P.P.?,"Yeah, you know me. And you know this song. It was a big hit. The b-side, ""Wickedest Man Alive"", features guest vocals by Queen Latifah."
4,Beats from the streets,"Any Naughty by Nature fan is sure to recognize the skilled work performed by the realist hip-hop crew out there, NAUGHTY BY NATURE."
3,The Sephardic Jews,"I recommend this book to people seeking information about the Jews of Spain and Portugal. This is a good intrudoctory book on the subject, but those with some knowledge in this area will most likely find it incomplete. Quite much more information is given on the Spanish Jews than on the Portuguese Jews, and the impact that the Jewish had on the Iberian Peninsula, especially in Portugal, is not fully revealed here."
3,Perfume Scent,"I thought I was getting a great bargain...however, I cannot smell this perfume! I used to get compliments on this fragrance, but the scent never lasts...I don't know what to attribute this too...however, I have returned to buring at dept. stores and the scent lasts longer."
4,pretty good deal,this is just as good as the stuff you get from the stores with just a better price. i liked it
4,Perfume Purchase,"My experience was great. Received my order on time, w/ some extra savings coupons. I would purchase from this vendor again, when the time comes."
3,"They look gorgeous, but....","I had been given sets in the past as gifts (not of the quality I wanted!), and wanted to invest in a good set of pots and pans. I knew t-fal made excellent cookware, so I spent the extra money on them. They are gorgeous, but definitely not non-stick (which I should have noticed- my fault!). They are consequently a PAIN to clean! And though it comes with four pots, they are all tiny. The largest- the dutch oven- is actually narrower than your average stock pot, though slightly taller- no large quantities of stews or soups, let alone steaming more than one artichoke at a time! Because they are stainless steel, they start looking used pretty much as soon as you get them wet. All in all, I would not get them again."
3,A sweet fairytale spoiled by foul language and radical animal activist agenda,"First of all, do not let your children see this film unless you want them hearing profanities including s--- and bulls--- and more. I can't fathom why they chose to sully such a sweet film with such filth.Secondly, be warned that this film advocates views consistent with the far fringe of animal activists. This movie is completely against hunting and fur coats, takes a dim view of guns and gun owners, and plays on the edges of advocating against consuming meat.So, even if you can find a ""clean"" edition of the movie that is edited for the harsh profanities, you're left with a movie that promotes some extreme political views that sully the otherwise sweet tale of a loveable-but-misunderstood creature who touches the lives of the Henderson family."
5,Great Fun,This movie is fun and cute. Harry is the cutest big foot you could ever encounter. I enjoyed this movie tremendously and would highly recommend it for the family.
5,Movie is a classic in our family,I loved this movie when my children were younger so I wanted my granddaughter to have it. She loves it! It arrived quickley and in great condition. I love shopping through Amazon.
5,Great buy!,"I always loved this movie as a kid, and when I seen it for sale I had to buy it. It is a great price for a classic movie. Now my kids will be able to enjoy the movies I was able to when I was younger."
5,Another Childhood Favorite!!!,"Ever since I was a kid, I've loved this movie! It has a great storyline, hilarious and tender moments. You fall in love with Harry because he is so adorable, lovable, and awesome! While on a hunting trip, the Hendersons run into a Bigfoot. When they think he's dead, they put him on the roof of the car. During the night, George Henderson wakes up and finds that Bigfoot is still alive. After a while, the family come to realize that he's gentle, and harmless, so they name him Harry. While the whole town is on the hunt for Harry, the Henderons must take Harry take to back to his home in the wilderness. I love when Harry laughs at the tv, and when George is on the news saying ""My name is George Hen."" I highly recommend HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS!!!"
5,Classic from my childhood!,"This is such a great movie, and the DVD captures it perfectly. Tons of laughs, and lots of heart, Harry and the Henderson is a movie the whole family can enjoy together for years to come."
3,Harry and The Hendersons,"I don't know what's so special about this edition - film was the same shown on television, and there were no extras, making of Harry and The Hendersons etc."
5,what's not to love,"came quickly, packaged well and just as promised brand newNephew lives in Germany and loved this movie as a child, he had it in vhs but I thought it was time to get him DVD too since he didn't have anyway of playing VHS....He loved the gift, although pretended to be ""cool"" about it LOL He would play this movie over and over as a child, I think he knows every word...he told me later he really liked the gift"
3,Language Alert! Not for kids,"I was considering getting this movie for my 7 year old, but I thought that I remembered some inappropriate language. After reading several reviews, it turned out that my foggy memory about the language was right. Too bad, because it is a really cute movie and has some great lessons. Maybe in a few years we will reconsider...."
4,An Old Favorite,"It's a shame they havent brought this out on DVD yet, its an old pastime thing i remember watching as a kid. Aint seen it in years, and been wanting it"
2,Beware! bad language,After reading the reviews I purchased this movie for my 8 yr old. The movie is a cute one but after awhile it uses some very harsh language....like G*** D*** word....and the son***** word....I dont know what people consider a family movie with all this bad language. If it wasnt for this it would be a excellent movie....
4,"WHEN YOU CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR EYES, Trust your Heart.","When I first noticed Harry and the Hendersons on television, my first thought was that this was going to be a chessy Bigfoot flick, boy was I dead wrong. This is a great movie, for watching with family and friends, or for catching on cable for just relaxing and watching a fun movie. Harry is very lovable and the films climax is very good with a great ending. I have read this book as well which has a very good tagline, that it's well played through the movie and the book.""When you can't believe your eyes, trust your Heart"",this played with the cover of the book just tugs at your heart just giving you a good filling, I think it's a good line to follow."
1,Love the movie...this DVD was defective scratched ALL over. New packaging obviously seconds.,We were so very disappointed. Bought it for New Years Eve sleepover with our grandchildren. 15 min into the show it went to pieces. We could actually see the defective area. So sad. Since there were lots of copies from this seller it was obviously a defective bunch and the seller was prob aware of it. Well you got us. Congratulations.Our 3 and 5 year old Grandchildren went to bed seeing 1/2 a movie on New Years.
5,Classic!,One of the best family films around for all ages.A must own to watch over and over.Can't beat the price.
5,Funny funny movie!,"I love this film. Its part of the magic ""trio"" of cult classic films: including ""Kazaam"" and ""Ghost dad.""This movie is about a family who is visited by big foot. The acting in this movie is amazing! The charcters responded so realisticly.I know this is supposed to be a comedy, but the actors responded so realistcly to having a big foot living in their house. Thats the way I would have acted if it was really happening to me.Well, not much can be said about this movie. It basicly speakes for it itself.ENJOY"
5,I just saw this on ...a cable channel,"complete and un-interrupted by commericals, it was wonderful! I can't wait til it's out on DVD - I'm still holding on to my original VHS recording until I can upgrade."
3,This Cute Movie Should Be On DVD!,"I watched The movie Harry and The Henersons and I thought it was enjoyable and the cast was really very good especially John Lithgow (Third Rock from the Sun), Don Ameche (Trading Places, and David Suchet (Poirot) and I recommend this movie and I hope it will be put on DVD! The movie is about a family who discover big foot and wind up bringing the loveable creature home with them and the father played by John Lithgow with the help of his wife and children try to protect him from a mean hunter played by David Suchet who is after fame and glory by capturing him!"
3,LIttle Disappointed,"After a recent trip to Colorado where we saw a ""Bigfoot"" statue that looked just like Harry, I thought about the movie I had seen years before and thought it might be one my 5-year-old grandson would like. However, when I watched it, I was very disappointed in the cursing that took place during the movie, some by the children. I decided then that it wasn't appropriate for him and that disappointed me. It's such a cute movie and I had really looked foward to him seeing it."
5,Harry and the Hendersons (Special Edition),"I love this movie, I was so glad it came out on DVD. I always wanted my 2 sons to see it but I could never find it anywhere. It was as good as I remembered it to be and my kids thought it was great and have watched a number of times since we first watched it."
3,Ok Book,This book is ok. It reads rather boring and even the picture do nothing to excite the mind. I would have rather used a different title than this.
5,Excellent Handbook!,"This comprehensive guide to wireless networking technology, standards, and procedures is the definitive reference in the wireless world. I highly recommend it."
1,Severely Outdated - Do not buy it.,"This book is very, very outdated. For example, it predicts that LMDS will be the clear winner in broadband wireless coverage. The market leaders predicted by this book are all bankrupt."
5,A MUST read,"Anyone serious about a career in the music business MUST read this book. Even though it is 596 pages, I read it cover to cover in less than a week! This has got to be the most comprehensive guide to the music business ever written. Everything from entertainment law, to launching your career, to pitching your songs, to digital rights and everything in between is covered. There are even chapters on wills, trusts, and estates. An excellent read!"
5,The Moralist,"An absorbing book with a refreshing view of bonding across generations in our present times. Historically, this bonding has occurred over the centuries without condemnation. Mr. Downey clearly demonstrates the paranoia and witch-hunt mentality of contemporaneous morally bankrupt philistines who condemn such friendships."
5,Well Done Rod Downey.,"Three Cheers! for Rod Downey. _The Moralist_ may be fiction however it is a true storey nonetheless. It is a real storey, happening all around us and right before our eyes.Well Done Rod Downey.But it is also a very scary storey. I've not completed it yet, I am almost afraid to for fear that just by reading it I will make it happen.Gardyloo, ajo"
2,extremely uneven book,"Parts of the book were decently written and parts were so cliche that it was as though the author had dual personalities with diametric writing abilities. Also there were a few inaccuracies (Calling Kelsey Grammar ""Chelsea Grammar"" and mis-attributing an actor from Saturday Night Live to a character that he didn't play) which i always find to be annoying, particularly since misappropration like this is so avoidable...was this book even edited for cultural accuracy? There were several mis-spellings and a few sentences that truly didn't make sense...made me feel like it wasn't worth my time to read something that the author clearly didn't care enough about to polish properly before publication. an amateur attempt at writing, that comes off more like a long college term paper."
3,"OK, but better found",It was fine yet I found a longer extension with all sorts of attachments at Costco and bought that one instead.
2,A biassed book,"The author tells an interesting story about some of the most known german physicist and their role in the attempt to produce an atomic bomb. Unfortunatelly he does not tell the pure facts, he gives his personal interpretation on each comment made by the germans and tries to make you think that they wanted to produce a bomb at any cost, that one of the most famous physicist, Heisenberg, did not know enough nuclear physics and that everything Heisenberg said, was just to hide his failure. A biassed book."
1,Kindle edition misses essential notes and comments,"Unfortunately, the Kindle edition of this important and interesting book does not link correctly to the editor's notes and comments. These are absolutely essential -- this is a transcript, and the notes and comments clarify both historical and technical context. I finally had to get a printed copy of the book -- my Kindle edition was a waste of money!Having read the printed copy, I give that edition very high marks. But don't buy the Kindle edition unless they fix the editorial notes and comments."
3,Farm Hall Transcripts,"The Farm Hall Transcripts in English translation (some parts include the original German) with commentary. One is better off reading the transcripts directly, available both in German transcribed from the secret recordings of conversations (best choice) and in English translation. Heisenberg wrote directly about his ideas in 'Der Teil und das Ganze' (translated into English and titled 'Physics and Beyond'). All of it makes for interesting reading, especially Power's 'Heisenberg's War'."
4,du rocks,another gem from the genius of shock g and crew.it's ashame that this group doesn't get more love.
5,Elegant,"With the holidays coming up soon, my wife and I will be hosting quite a few dinner parties and there's nothing we like better as one of our appetizers than these oysters.I've found these oysters to have a sweet and buttery taste, which I really love. We serve them raw or barely cooked and I really can't get enough of them. I could make a meal on them, but I try to behave and save some for my guests.These oysters are an elegant food, not meant for everyday. Just knowing they're on the menu helps to put me in a festive, party mood. Many of our guests have told us that one of the things they love most about our dinner parties are the oyster appetizers.If you've never served oysters as an appetizer to an elegant meal before, you can't go wrong with these. They will make your meal so much more delicious and so much more memorable. But one caveat: Be ready when guests ask you the next time...Are you having oysters?"
3,Not strong or versatile enough,I mainly wanted a glue product that would easily stick all my ticket stubs and pictures into a notebook or onto craft projects and Krazy glue did not work as well as I thought it would. I would brush it on and the material would absorb the glue and not be sticky afterwards. I had to resort to using a combination of Elmer's glue stick and this Krazy glue to make paper on paper actually stick.
5,Excellent for fixing leather handbags.,"Decided on the Krazy Glue with BRUSH - and happy I did so - my first challenage was a faux leather yellow hobo handbag with double rings on each side of the bag. Two years ago (yes, I waited two years to purchase this miracle glue) the faux leather came detached from the double rings on one side only. All I had to do was put the leather evenly where I wanted to glue the yellow straps through the rings and hold it securely for 30 seconds and brother it does adhere in 30 seconds. I placed a heavy object on top of the new repair spot and checked back at it in two hours and it is just like new. Can't believe I waited soooooooooo long."
2,not your parent's crazy glue,"Pro: new packaging is a good ideacons: cannot bind every material like my old tube krazy glue. (rubbermaid plastic don't work, metals don't work). still binds hard plastic and skin, though.thoughts: they must have changed the formulation so the glue can be contained in the new packaging without drying out quickly. it's a nice idea. but krazy glue that cannot bind everything i throw at it is really not krazy glue at all."
1,Not Crazy about Krazy glue,"Im not sure why I bought this again. I thought they improved it, but it is still not the best stuff out there. If you want to glue stuff to your hands or glue paper or fabric together this is the glue for you. It does not work well on metals or plastic!!!"
4,Glue with a brush,"This glue with the built in brush is cool. It makes application easy and avoids mess. Wow, I didn't have anything else to say really but the program required more words..."
1,Brush-on Krazy Glue,The applicator brush stuck inside the container after the first use and sealed the bottle. Couldn't break it loose or fish it out. What a waste...
5,super glue -brush on,"Great product,we like the brush on type.This type is sometimes hard to find,but by ordering it ,it's great that it comes right to your house.Stuart"
5,Fixed a chip on a cermaic bowl,"Just what I needed to repair a chip on a ceramic bowl I had. Didn't realize this was a brush rather than a squeeze tube, although in retrospect it's clearly labeled and I should have looked closer. But really the brush was very useful for getting the glue exactly where I needed it, and now I only have a minimal amount of the ineveitable glue on my fingertips."
4,Sinners in the Hands of,Short and easily readable. Informative and provocative. Recommend as a book to read when learning of the history of the church.
2,Abridged!!??!!,"Just so you know: the Oxford World Classics edition of LA REINE MARGOT is abridged. Oxford ""justifies"" the abridged version by saying it's the best known, but I think if MARGOT were as popular as THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, Oxford would spend the extra money to give it to us in full. I understand things like Readers Digest condensing books for the masses, but shouldn't something as scholarly as Oxford World Classics give us the real thing? What about Dumas fans who want to read his stories they way he wrote them? Most Dumas readers aren't afraid of long books, especially if they've read MONTE CRISTO or VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE(which is almost TWICE as long as MONTE CRISTO). Unfortunately, the unabridged version seems only available in French. But I'm a biggish Dumas fan, so I read Oxford's abridged MARGOT rather than nothing. It's great, Great, GREAT, but a shadow hung over the entire book making wonder what I was missing. What Dumas-esque character moments did I miss? What details?"
2,Enjoy Dumas in general but terrible ending,Really enjoyed La Reine Margot except for the ending which was cataclysmically dark. Would have given the book 4 or 5 stars otherwise.
1,"illegitimate premise, no credentials, silly book","There are so many problems with this ""book"" it's difficult to know where to begin. I looked into it because there has been an annoying ad for it in the New York Review of Books for many issues. (1) The author has no credentials. I wish the NYRB would not sully its reputation by allowing an ad for this quackery in its august pages. (2) It's not really a book but a bunch of quotations. (3) There is no genuine acknowledgment that the Freudian thesis presupposed throughout has not been found credible. Freud had issues, and so does the author of this book. (4) Human psycho-sexual development is complex and diverse; only a simpleton would find the simplistic thesis of this ""book"" convincing."
5,the short and long of it,"this book, written by one of the most prolific psychologists of our generation regarding research and publishing, is short and to the point about the penis.... just like Dr. Templer's. Frued would have a field day getting into Don's unconscious understanding how ones preoccupation with their own package would result in a document outlining the significance of size throughout history and viewing through other cultures. Dr. Templers ""handling"" of this concept is based on his own ""hands on"" experiences throughout a life goverened by a stong ego that doesnt have much basis in reality. i enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone who wants to get in touch with their ""junk"""
5,Excellent: Wish Their Was An App Also!,"Love this book as a guide to pray scripturally for my kids. Would so love to see an additional resource, such as for youBible so that I could copy prayers, insert my child's name, and email, text, or forward the prayers to them so that they could ""hear"" them through their day on relevant topics."
4,Great book for any parent,"We are using this book along with the study guide in our Young Married's bible study class. If you buy the book, I would definately buy the study guide to go with it.This book gives parents lots of ideas and examples for the different areas of your child's life that you can pray for. Each chapter is short, covers one specific area of your childs life that you can pray for, and ends with a sample prayer (which is sometimes the best part of the chapter).I do have a couple of problems with this book. Stormie seems to insinuate that if something bad happens to your child, it is because you didn't pray hard enough. You need to realize that sometimes bad things do happen, no matter how much we pray. Also, if your child is under 4, there is a lot that is not relevant. Of course, it will become relevant, and you should probably go back a re-read this book every few years. Overall it is good book to get discussions started with other parents."
5,The best purchase a parent can ever make for their child.,Please buy this book now. It is truly wonderful. It will give your child the best possible start in life - a life built upon the rock that is Jesus Christ.
5,must read book for christian parents,"Excellent book and well written. It's easy to follow, logical and Biblical. Bible verses were appropriate and gave deeper meaning to her stories. Each chapter is short and specific. Perfect for a small group study."
4,For parents,I have not read this book myself. I ordered it for my daughter who is the mother of 7 and was using the book in a discussion group. She finds it very helpful.
4,One book every parent should read,"Yeah, most new parents read ""What to Expect When You're Expecting,"" or one of the other similar books. But if you're a parent who wants to really do some good for your child, prayer is of the utmost importance. This book is a good place to start.Stormie talks a lot about her own experiences with prayer in the lives of her children. This book is divided into thirty chapters. The first part of each chapter, usually only 2 or 3 pages long, discusses a different area of childrens' lives, and the importance of praying specifically for that area. Then follows an example prayer, then ""Weapons of Warfare,"" several Scripture verses on that particular topic.A parent's prayers should go well beyond the examples in this book, of course. But especially for a new parent, or even a new Christian, this book gives great examples from which to build upon."
5,Great Find!,"I was able to find this book for a very reasonable price. And on top of that, I was able to receive it quickly. What more can I ask for?!"
2,"Love Stormie, but disappointed in this book","I've read it several times to try to get something more from this, but it's really hard. Easy reading, but it just doesn't click like most of her books have. A ton of very short chapters with fewer ""examples"" and life stories than most. Her books usually feel like you're having a chat with her over coffee; this one is more like reading a choppy lecture. I love her books, but this one just didn't do it for me."
2,over-simplification,"Stormie Omartian's book is easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to implement into one's own life. However, the lack of specificity misleads one into thinking that prayer can be a quick and easy fix for any parental situation. Not the case at all. It's faith that does all the work, and no prayer in this book will generate the faith necessary for psychological healing. That, my friends, comes from within."
5,Perfect,This book is a great book for parents who are needing that little encouragement and direction for daily prayer for their children. It is organized by topics of concern and supported with appropriate Scriptures.
5,Must Read,"What every parent needs to help raise their children and continually pray for them every day. They are never too young or too old to start praying for their every need whether it be a future spouse or just something that is bothering them at that moment. As a parent, you can't be with your kids 24/7, but you always have the ability to pray for them and trust God will protect them."
3,Check out the H07 error problem with Panasonic DVD players,"A number of different Panasonic DVD players get the dreaded H07 error code anywhere from 10 months to 1.5 years old. If you google for ""panasonic dvd H07"" you will see MANY people complaining about the problem. Be sure to check out the problem for this model before you buy.I am a Panasonic DVD player owner and was happy with its performance until the dreaded H07 error occurred. It is only good for the trash now as repair costs more than buying a new unit. Many other users have had this problem with many different models of Panasonic DVD players made in China. Perhaps their chinese supplier did a shortcut that resulted in the many H07 errors. Just google and check it out."
2,Don't waste your time,"In general the product worked ok...but the image quality would be a C- at best. Very soft focus, bad jaggies, and does not improve through ""user"" adjustments."
1,Buyer Beware,"Over the past few years Panasonic has been selling DVD players with motors that burn out after about 1 year. My player was an S35 and it lasted nine months. Panasonic has done nothing to address this situation. If you really want the Panasonic, scour the Web before you buy to make sure that there aren't a lot of complaints out there. Then cross you fingers."
3,good Abbott and Costello,"This movie is a bit dated, but it's always fun to watch Abbott and Costello."
3,Stop Comparing & Just Enjoy,"It isn't the best Abbott & Costello film and it certainly isn't the best Universal Monster film, but what they hey it is funny to watch. At least you get Béla Lugosi as Dracula and Lon Chaney, Jr as the Wolfman (it almost excuses Glen Strange as Frankenstein's Monster). Bud & Lou as enjoyable as they play their usual characters and even get off some witty remarks. If you get bored try to catch the film goofs (Vampires shouldn't have reflects!)I enjoyed it again from Saturday afternoons Creature Features, while my nephew found the monsters along with A & C to be funny."
5,Best Horror/Comedy EVER!,"Bud and Lou's first rendezvous with the Classic Monsters of Universal, if not counting 1941's HOLD THAT GHOST, is a bonanza to be cherished even after it's initial release over 50 years ago. The screenplay of Count Dracula plotting to use Lou's dimwitted brain for the Monster is clever, funny, original, and scary. Lenore Aubert makes a great vampire villainous, and Lugosi's Dracula, Chaney's Wolfman, and Glenn Strange's Frankenstein Monster all help keep the film suspenseful and funny. The chase scenes, the ""You and 20 million other guys"" joke, and the forest chases, are still uproarious to this day.The DVD is truly amazing, and Gregory Mank's commentary, and the Documentary ""Abbott and Costello Meet the Monsters"" are fantastic treats for the eye and ears. Yes, that's Vincent Price's voice for the Invisible Man. Look out for the lit cigarette. This is simply the BEST! A true classic!"
5,Hilarious,A timeless classic where good clean comedy mixed with an entertaining plot-line are at its best. One of Abbott and Costello's best works.
4,Yooooooooo Aboooooooooooooot!,"This is a great collecters item as well as just a family film. Once again Abott and costello get teamed up with some of the movies biggest monster legends. Such as Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, and Count Dracula. Just a little bit overboard... Well, Its only a movie.(...) Thanks for reading."
5,"great flick, great blooper","I prefer the abbott & costello TV shows to their movies except for this one. Scary as a kid watching it all those years ago as our heroes did the best they could against all those monsters.In a bedroon scene, the Count bites Sandra in the neck and we see it as a reflection in her dresser mirror. Of course, as we know, a vampire does not have a reflection. Reflect on that!"
5,Hey Chick......,"Perhaps one of the best known Abbott & Costello films to come our way. This is the history of classic films combining the proper balance of horror and comedy. Bella Lugosi and Lon Chaney, Jr combine to make this one a memorable film moment. Classic lines and gags abound. Watch it over and over again."
4,Always fun,Always fun to watch these two comedians. Can't believe that kids don't know sho these guys are. Had to buy it after talking to the grandkids so we could share the fun.
5,When will this classic be available on DVD? wake up MCA!,"Not only is this A&C's best, its one of the best of the Universal Horror classics, spoof or otherwise!! As a HUGE Lugosi fanatic, it's heartwarming to witness Bela's return to the Dracula role. I'm on my 3rd factory copy, and am wondering when MCA/UNIVERSAL will give this one the collectors edition treatment on DVD. I'd love to see a David Skal produced documentary on this baby!! There's 5 or 6 titles i'd have a hard time living without... but this is without a doubt my ""desert island"" flick!"
5,One of my all-time favorites!!,"I can't remember exactly when I first saw this movie, but I know I must have been about 10...and that was 33 years ago. This still rates as one of my all-time favorite movies and Abbott and Costello's best film; the movie is so much fun. As most of the reviews have stated, the key element to the film's success is that the monsters played it straight and the comedy was left to Lou Costello - and what a wonderful result. One of our family traditions now is to set up a tent in the backyard in October and bring our portable television set inside and watch ""Abbott + Costello Meet Frankenstein."" My kids LOVE this movie!"
2,Universal films & fans deserve better quality transfers,"Don't waste your money on this ,,,I have always loved this film and have great respect for Universal. You can't imagine my dissapointment when I watched this so called Blu Ray version expecting to see ""Blu Ray quality"" but instead its simply more video noise and grain? The cropping is wrong as well. Will the upcoming Blu Ray release of the ""Classic Monster Collection"" be the same??Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy] (Universal's 100th Anniversary),, extremely disappointed."
5,Annual Halloween Fun,"Every Halloween, since I was eight years old, I watch this movie. Watching it brings back all the memories of Halloween. It was one of those things that captured my childhood. Maybe it will be the same for you!"
5,Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein,"This movie is a great classic! Abbott & Costello are two of my favorite actors, and funny they are! I was pleased with the quality of the movie, and the price was great too. I had been looking for this movie for a while and in checking out amazon for the first time, I got to see the wide range of movies that they carry, so now I know where to search for items that may be hard to find.Thank-you amazonAbbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"
2,Doesn't Hold Up,"I had watched this as a child and enjoyed it. Upon viewing again, as an adult, this movie was a disappointment. I'm not sure why it holds so many critical praises. Yes, I understand this is the swan song for the Monsters of Universal Studios. But the plot is bad. The dialogue is bad. It is just not funny. There are no laughs, no suspense; No scares or interesting characters. It's just the Paul Blart: Mall Cop of the 1940s."
5,The very best A & C comedy,The boys are in fine form in this film. Everything works to perfection. I introducted A & C to my grandkids with this film and they absolutely loved it. They have watched it so many times they know the dialouge verbatim. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie and if you have kids in the house - buy it!
2,cute only goes so far,"I was drawn to these dominoes because of the fun retro candy images. What I didn't realize when I ordered them is that they are CARDBOARD dominoes. Very cute, but don't hold up to repeated use by children."
5,That Girl Is A Cowboy!,"This is a great CD! I purchased this CD for the song ""That Girl Is A Cowboy"" and ended up liking most of the CD. ""She Don't Care About Me"" & ""Allison Miranda"" are great! ""Good Ride Cowboy"" & ""A Cowgirl's Saddle"" will catch any horse lover's ears! ""You Can't Help Who You Love"" is beautiful! ""That Girl Is A Cowboy"" is My Song! It's the best Garth Brooks song I have ever heard! It really should have been released as a single so more people would've heard it! If something happened to this CD I would definetly buy another copy! That's a pretty good review for any CD!"
3,disappointed,I think Tyrone was not at his best and was very sad to hear my favourite singer the way it was on this cdI believe he died a few months after this recording. Would not reccomend this one.
1,Displeased,"I had a sony cd player did mps as well as audio cd. loved it, used it, broke it. The Jwin Jxcd933 which is more expensive than the sony can't hold a candle to it. The thing skips when I walk and won't hold my place if I have to turn the thing off. The only good thing about it is the large function window which is easy to read."
3,"Great entertainers, poor sound quality","Pink Martini makes wonderful music on CDs, but they are at their best in concert. This DVD gives a flavor of their concert performance, but the quality of the DVD is not the best. It does not have any options for surround sound or anything else. The good news is that I saw them recently in concert, and China Forbes said that they would have a new CD in October 2009 and a new live DVD in a year. I hope that the new DVD will be of better quality. In the meantime, this DVD is recommended for anyone who has not seen them in concert. They are wonderful artists and performers with an amazing repertoire of music."
5,Pink Martini live!,"What's better than a Pink Martini CD? Pink Martini live!Thanks to a 2009 PBS Special, this great CD is a live concert recorded on stage at the historic Portland Theater in Portland, Oregon. Favorite moments: when each artist in their ""little orchestra"" got to shine; their joy in playing; the 4-year-old in the audience in her birthday crown sitting rapt, loving it all; the grande finale of exuberant feathered Brazilian dancers. And of course, That Voice, China Forbes! And to get a firsthand look at Thomas Lauderdale's athletic keyboard style!Ooolala! Olé! Mamma mia!"
4,"Buen material, pero sin opciones de audio...","Recién recibí el disco Hey Eugene! y me quedé prendado de la música de esta agrupación. Inmediatamente busqué el DVD y decidí comprarlo. Efectivamente tenían razón los usuarios que dicen que la calidad de audio es un tanto decepcionante, ya que sólo se puede escuchar en estéreo y dado que es una verdadera orquesta, hubiera sido excelente contar con una buena mezcla de audio. Pero bien es cierto que se disfruta mucho ver y escuchar este DVD."
3,Magnaflow 4.7 H.O.JEEP Exhaust-cat back,"high quality item but beware that if your jeep has the 4.7 H.O.motor,the magnaflow pipe dose not fit.I had to make a custom adapter to make it work on my truck.Instructions do not say anything about the H.O. motor having a larger pipe than the stock 4.7 but it must."
1,Disliked !,I disliked this book because the poetry was not very good and there wasn't very much of it needs more poetry
4,Very effective but requires careful monitoring,"We purchased soft claws at our vet's recommendation when our 15-year-old tortie decided to start clawing our new furniture. Despite being old and having no experience with claw caps, our cat took to them just fine and ignores them as soon as they're applied. Take care, however, to monitor your cat's claws after a few weeks. The caps do fall off eventually, and will need replacement. But if they don't (i.e. from too much adhesive), the cat's claw will grow around and start to dig into the pad of the paw. In this case, the nail needs to be *carefully* clipped at the edge of the cap; the old nail will fall away and there will be a (sharp!) new claw underneath."
4,Nice training tool,"The softpaws are easy to apply but they are definitely not a permanent solution. My cat didn't seem to mind them much at first but after about a week she began biting them off. Now that she knows she can pull them off they only stay on for a few days. If you're looking for a temporary solution while you train the cat they're perfect, but they're not a long-term solution."
4,"Great, but I could use more glue and applicators",These nail caps were the perfect solution to protect my furniture without putting my cat through the trauma of declawing. My only complaint is that there aren't enough glue tips and glue tubes in each package. The nail caps do not fall off at the same time so I often replace only two or three at a time. After six months of using these nail caps I have more than 40 extra nail caps and I am buying new packages just for the glue and glue tips.
3,ok but not fantastic,The claws were easy to put on but glue was awkward to use. My cat managed to remove one claw within a few minutes. The rest stayed on for at least a week until he chewed them off one by one.
5,Great Alternative,"We've only been using these nail caps for about a week now and they're wonderful. My cat didn't even notice that they were on, and none have fallen off yet. It's saving our furniture and our hands when we play with him. Great alternative to declawing!"
2,My cat ripped them off,"I followed the instructions exactly, but my cat still was able to bite/rip these off one by one. I was hoping there would be some solution other than declawing, but this is not it. I will not ever declaw my cat and I would not recommend anyone does."
2,Frusterated,"I was so excited about this product because I am tired of my dinning and living room furniture getting ruined. I cut my cats nails as teh instructions state and filled the 'soft claws' 1/3 full of glue like it also stated. Easy to place on cats nails...when they sit still(my cat can be a challenge at times), but the next day there were eight that had come off. Thinking that I did not place enough glue I put new nails and filled 1/2 with the glue. Again by the next morning they came off. I am just fruterated b/c my furniture is getting torn and my sweet hard headed cat eats off the soft claws....I will try it again for the third time...hopefully this time it will do the trick."
5,GREAT,"These are great. They stay on for a long time and naturally grow out, and you replace them as they do. Its better than declawing your cat (which is harmful to the animal in many ways) and once they are ON the cat, they don't mind them at all. I love them for my cat and to protect anything that might get harmed from my cat's extra toes... ha. Thanks!Highly recommended."
1,Tried on Multiple Cats - False Hope / Wrong Solution,"We have tried these on multiple cats. The cats always immediately try to take the claws off by biting at their claws. They are clearly unhappy. Eventually they always succeed.My wife is a vet. We have over a dozen scratching toys in our home. These may help but they don't affect certain cats desire to destroy furniture.I find it very hurtful and misleading stating that softclaws are an alternative and that declawing cats is inhumane. It is not true, in our cases, that there are alternatives to furniture destruction such as soft claws. We have 2 cats that were declawed when kittens, they are happy and don't destroy furniture.I certainly recommend giving them a try before surgery. In our multiple cases with different cats they have never worked."
1,DO NOT GET THESE,"I bought these in stores, Theyre HORRIBLE, she gets her nails caught, there way to bulky, theyre painful, she can no longer jump up on the bed, it kills me to see her like this, she hates them, if you love your cat, DO NOT GET THESE."
3,Works well for a short while,"Maybe I needed to use more glue but most fell off rather quickly (started falling off between 1-3 weeks), i followed the directions on how much to use. Other than that I could see using them with a stronger glue than given may work well."
5,Works great for my cat,"I began using these with my cat over a week ago and they have worked out better than expected so far. My cat does not scratch at things intentionally (except her scratching post) but I am using them for the unintentional scratches & punctures from her front & rear claws. They were relatively easy to apply and my cat doesn't seem to mind them. However, my cat is typically quite laid back and is good at just ""going with the flow"". She was already used to having her nails trimmed. The instructions give a good tip in advising to fill 10 nails with glue and then pop them on in succession. My cat has lost 3 of the caps in the 1+ week she has had them. However, I'm pretty sure it was in my application (not enough glue) and not due to the caps or her pulling them off. The back claws seem to need a little more glue because those claws are shorter & stubbier. I have not had any ill side effects (glue in hair, messed up / bloody nails, etc) that are mentioned by others."
1,Please don't use these,"I have used soft claws in the past, with success. Recently, I decided to use them again. However, this time, one of the soft claws never fell off. I kept waiting for it to fall off, or for my cat's claw to grow long enough that I could clip it off....It never happened.I am taking my cat to the vet tomorrow to get the soft claw removed. The claw is pressed against his paw pad, so I have no other choice. I can't clip it off, because the nail is too thick. IT WON'T COME OFF.They just aren't worth it."
2,Maybe It Was Me,"Maybe it was me. Maybe I just didn't get them on well. Maybe it was the cat. She didn't exactly cooperate and sit beautifully still and let me put them on. Maybe it's the adhesive. Even once we got them one, she was able to chew most of them off with a few hours of determined work.Overall, great concept. Should maybe come with sedation for the cat so you can get them on snugly.Or they should come with a cat that's already trained to let you put them on."
5,outstanding product..,"Cat doesn't scratch my stuff, why didn't I think of this before! Cat tried to take them off but left them alone afterwards. 1 fell off but I must have pout the glue wrong... I love it!"
3,Empty Bed,The film and production is done very well.. I was disappointed with the content of the film..... seeing a lonely older man (60 yr. old) telling a disappointing life story through flashbacks and short 'rememberances'. I was expecting a much more indepth study of life as an older gay man. I didn't see anything hilarious or comedic about it...
1,An Empty Life,"I have always been told.If you do not have anything nice to say about someone or something.Don't say it.So,I will be nice and just say.If you don't have a life,Sitting in jail,Money to burn or on death row.This is the movie for you.I'm sorry,let me be nice by just saying this is the first time I have ever been so dissatisfied after viewing a movie.I trashed it. They should have named this boring short story. An Empty Life."
5,excellent music,"T he cd in excellent condition, the music is outstanding from one of my favorite orquesta, plus I recommend this cd, it is a must and I also recommend the seller for great service"
1,Trash!,"This is not a serious book, it is a scandal tract! The kind of questions (Did Martha seduce Hem or did Hem seduce Martha) and the entire approach is gossipy in the worst kind of scandal sheet. It doesn't produce any new serious analysis either of the war or of any of its actors. It isn't worth the paper on which it is printed! It is a waste of time, unless the reader happen to enjoy sordid stories which, moreover, are hardly true in any objective, dispassionate sense. What is the author trying to prove? Hard to tell. Don't waste your time reading this pseudo-analysis of an important event within a tragedy. If it were possible, I would give an evaluation below 1!"
2,"Cher, Madonna, Prince ... and Linder?","Hoping there was more depth to Linder Sterling's work than her photocollages of the middle to late 1970's, which I quite enjoyed,I purchased this book. I was wrong. I'm not a fan of her ""performance art"" nor her recent work, which seems to be shallow and/or without any merit or edge. Additionally, I'm absolutely horrified when people. who have obviously abandoned their medication, mention her in the same sentence with Kurt Schwitters or John Heartfield. More appropriately, she should be mentioned with other egotistical artists who prefer to use only their first names. But then again, what do I know?"
4,Biased but interesting,This book was written by a good friend of the great singer so it was pretty biased but enjoyable anyway. It had a great insight on what it was like to be on the road with Celine. I recommend this book
5,Bravo!,"No word can truly discribe Celine's wonderful voice, dreams and spirit, but I believe this book has managed to do the best it could. Of course, you cannot feel Celine's passion by simply read a book. However, I can ensure you that after reading this book, you must at least start to like this real-life model of human being -- Celine Dion."
1,Awesome,"Very addicting. Couldn't put it down!!Informative, well written.Feel I know Celine and family personally.Thanks for the adventure."
5,EXCELLENT!,I've read this same book in French and I must say that it's an excellent book! It includes almost everything you wanna know about Céline!!
4,50th birthday gift,The product was received in a timely manner. The gift receipient loves bling and she was not disappointed .
4,A lot better than the PC version,"I love the PC version of Wolfenstein. When Wolfenstein 3D came to the consoles, I tried the SNES version first. The SNES version was an abomination thanks to it being ""Nintendo sanitized"". The Jaguar version censors NOTHING. And the Jaguar version offers all of the PC levels. The game makes great use of the Jaguar controller...you use the keypad to select which weapon you wish to use. One of the best games for the Jaguar. Highly recommended for fans of Wolfenstein."
2,Keep Looking,"After doing extensive research before making this purchase, we have been satisfied with the picture quality. The focus and colors are sharp. However, the flash malfunctioned after less than 6 months.As far as ease of use, overall it is not bad, but subjects are difficult to line up in the viewfinder.Compared to others on the market, it is loaded with features (as long as it works). We won't be buying another Fuji again in the near future.A final warning to those considering the APS format- film and processing costs are considerably higher per roll vs. 35mm."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This will be my first and last APS camera. The quality of pictures is terrible compared with even a cheap 35 mm camera. The picture quality reminded me of the old Compact Disc cameras of the 80's. The main reason I bought this camera was to take panoramic pictures easily with the regular 4x6 size, but I have already sent this camera back for a refund. Instead, I decided to use my old 35mm zoom camera for the 4x6's and buy a disposable APS for the panoramics, because the picture quality is the same. Also, the quartz date didn't work on the front. The only thing good I can say about this camera was the small size."
5,The greatest camera,"This camera has a 75 Millimeter zoom. It has red eye reduction, night mode, landscape view, and through window view special effects. It uses APS film (I personally suggest speed 200). It is small and can fit into a pocket. It comes with speed 200 tape and A comfortable case. You can additionally buy a remote control for family pictures. Also for large pictures you can make it so that they are long. I strongly reccomend this camera."
4,This is what singing can and should be,"""Ms. Gruberova is a true consummate artist""- that is an understatement. She has power over her voice to make it do things that very few humans can, and yet she spins her vocal lines with audacity and abandon. Her voice, from top to bottom, is limpid, flexible, and fluid. Her recording of the aria from Romeo and Juliette is by far my favorite recording of this aria because she captures the youthfulness of Juliette through stunning up-and-down singing in a tone that is uniform and brilliant from top to bottom- and yet entirely spontaneous and hysterical, just as a young pubertal woman would if she possessed an instrument as TREMENDOUS as Ms. Gruberova's. There are moments when you can actually feel how flexible and poised her larynx, soft palate, and tongue are. Her instrument is truly a divine gift to mankind!"
1,Inadequate coverage for actual Networking Technologies test,"To be fair, the tests have not been around too long, and this was one of the first comprehensive books on the market, which is most likely its downfall. For starters, the CNA exam coverage is adequate, aside from some of the blatant typos and file system/NDS rights issues mentioned above herein. But the real whammy is the networking technologies coverage, which is a paltry ~180 pages. Using this section as a sole study guide for that exam will almost inevitably lead to a failing grade (unless one has extensive every-day experience with routers in diverse environments), as there are several sections on the actual exam not even brushed upon in that section of the book, such as routing protocols (NLSP, BGP, EIGRP, et al). In sum, at least for that material, go with others such as Clarke and Netware press."
2,"Great exam hints, bad information","This book has some great hints for taking the exams but unfortunately contains some bad information. Specifically the information on page 334 - figuring out effective rights - is dead wrong. Because of the seriousness of this and other errors, I couldn't recommend it. The Netware 5 CNA/CNE Study Guides from Network Press are more accurate."
5,Very Good Study Material,"The exam watch warnings came in handy for the test, which I aced. I found the self test portions extremely useful, and the correct answer explanations were fine. I would sugest theis guide to others."
2,Not presented as advertised,"I used this book along with two other study guides. The other guides were both more accurate and complete, but reading this first gave me a shorter, and fairly good introduction to the material. It let me know where I needed to study further.On the down side, whole topics were missing from each of the six sections. This book is a fine starting point, if you have other resources to draw from.However.From the cover of the book: ""complete coverage of all the required core exams"". This is simply not true. This book is not ""complete"". This book fails to live up to its own claims."
1,I wasted money buying this book. Novell Press is better.,The answers don't always match Novell's answers and guess who is correct. Some tests cover areas that are covered in other sections of the book than the section for that particular test.
4,"Not a bad book after all, very useful","I used this book for the service and support, NDS Impl, and intergrating Windows NT and I passed very well. an average of about 80% on each test. I agree it needs some proper editing. Not as bad as some of my collegues have put downMCSE, CNE, CCNA"
4,Pretty Damn Good,From the very first page Scar Tissue captivates the reader's attention. Anthony Kiedis is a vocalist of the world famous band called the Red Hot Chili Peppers. His life was full of so many exciting times like getting high and jumping off buildings into pools to playing in front of thousands of screaming fans. In this book AK recalls the many highs and lows of his life. There isn't a dull moment in this biography. From cover to cover I found it hard to put the book down. Any fan of the RHCP should read this book because it gives you a deeper understanding of what made them what they are today. The stories behind many of their songs are discussed. The many transformations that they went through are also detailed. Overall this book would be a great read for anyone who considers themselves a fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
5,I'm addicted!,"This book is excellent!It's so good, I can't put it down and when I do, I can't wait to pick it up again!It is so entertaining, a must read for anyone!"
4,"It's blunt, honest, and surprisingly deep","Anthony Kiedis accounts for the major events in his life, from conception to present-day and isn't afraid to sugar-coat any of his experiences. Anyone who enjoys the Chili Peppers and would like to get a little background on some of their songs as well as a glimpse into the soul and feeling of the band will enjoy this read. It takes you on a roller-coaster ride, from the highs of being high to the gut-wrenching lows of having to get high no matter the cost.Overall, Scar Tissue presents a stunningly fresh, honest view of the hard-partying lifestyle of rock music as seen through the eyes of Red Hot Chili Peppers wild frontman Anthony Kiedis. The only drawback is that certain aspects of Anthony's life aren't filled in; some events tend to jump from one to the other with little transition, but overall it is a very interesting read and well-worth the 400+ pages."
5,Amazing and revealing,"At first I really didnt know what to expect from this book. I started off thinking this was just going to be a typical rock star story, how wrong I was. Anthony reveals all in this book, everything from his childhood in Grand Rapids and later in Hollywood and later describes his first encounters with drugs and sex. And how drug addiction has been a never ending story for him untill now. I highly encourgae everybody to read this book I entered this book a fan of the chilli peppers and Anthony and leave it with a more profound respect for all of them. I am just thankful that Anthony let us in his life and see what it is like to be a person with an ongoing problem with addiction and still manages to overcome it with his own strong will."
4,Scars Can Be Beautiful,"I read this book in about a day and a half. Found it hard to go to sleep because I wanted to keep reading! Anthony's tale of misspent youth, drugs, and debauchery were both amusing and horrifying. If you can't be a good example you can be a horror story (or something like that--can't remember the exact quote). Have always been a fan of the Chilis music and love them now more than ever. While later work hasn't received acclaim from critics I find a maturity and self-reflection in their last 2 cd's that wasn't present before. Music aside, this book was a definite must-read for Chilis fans (and who isn't?)."
4,A look into the orgins of the RHCP,"RHCP fans will enjoy this one, especially the detailed look into the early years of AK, Flea, and the formation of the band. I would give the 1st half of the book 5 stars, but I took a star off because the 2nd half becomes very repetitive (band rehearsal, drug binge, breakup with a girl, go to rehab, and repeat, for about 6 straight chapters).As I was reading the book I kept thinking ""How is this guy still alive, and how does this band still exist?"" With his friends and fellow musicians dying all around him from overdoses, AK somehow made it through, and the world has some phenomenal music because of it."
4,A facinating story,"As a huge fan of the RHCP, this book was as addicting to read as chocolate. Anthony's llife is truly remarkable and the fact that he made it this far is amazing. He is also a very talented writer who is introspective and descriptive. If you listen to their music, this book will bring you deeper into the music than you thought you could go, and as close to the band as you will probably ever be."
4,How much I have in common with AK!!!!!,"It is a great read for anyone but especially for a recovering addict.Sounds like you have found serinty Anthony,I want what you have brother,and I am willing to go to any lengths to get it.Thanks for sharing."
2,arrested emotional development,"Very disappointing read. The book needed a good editor to cut down on the number of times Kiedis describes the tedious process of waiting to cop, copping, drugging and nodding off. Only broken up by stories about his myriad sexual escapades with women (only under the age of 25 and/or of the model/actress/fashion designer variety except for one patronising paragraph about a fat girl). Don't be expecting any eloquent turns of phrase either. He's selfish, a bit sexist but still very charasmatic. Save your money and buy his CDs instead."
2,Tedious Therapy Or Rock Biography?,"Dishwater dull. Here is the book in a nutshell: pseudo-spiritual awakening, followed by women, followed by drugs. Repeat.Some musicians tell great stories, and I'm sure there is an interesting story here, but the book could do with some very heavy editing. It would be a lot better book if it was half as long.This book is self-obsessed, rehab narcissism for completists. Kiedes proves there's one thing more boring that a drug addict - an ex drug addict."
4,"More Details, Please","A page turner, definitely - I mean how can it not be when you are a famous, rich, rock star, doing tons of drugs, f'ing hot girls, and traveling all over the world. He had some really great stories and experiences to share, but it always seemed that just when he was getting into a good story or describing some of his wisdom or insights, he would end the story/simplify the lesson or gravity of it all. So, this bio lacked depth. Although, overall, I do appreciate his honesty about everything he did, said - he really put down the good, bad, and ugly. I had no idea he had suffered through so many years of all kinds of addictions - substances, love, codependency. I think he has a lot to say - I wish he would say more. I'm glad I didn't pay more than $7.63 for this one."
4,story of hope,"I read this book because I have an addict son. I read everything I can about drug addiction, drug addict artists, effects of drugs on the individual and the family and friends. It is excellent in describing Anthony's long journey beginning at a very young age his incredibly hard journey with drug addiction. I liked the RHCP but that's not the reason I read this book. It is a book of hope to me. Anthony's struggles will resonate with anyone who is an addict, IF they can see themselves, but especially families of addicts who suffer as much as the addict. Congrats for making it Tony. I know that it was alot of luck you survived but I'm so glad you are well and alive to help others. If you made it, then I believe my son (and his other addict friends) can make it too. Thanks for the hope."
5,A must read for RHCP fans.,I have been listening to The Red Hot Chili Peppers since I was a little kid. My father gave me Blood Sex Sugar Magic when I was 8 and I listened to it every day. It's really amazing to piece all the songs with his reasoning for writing it. His trials are inspirational.
1,UNBELEIVABLE,"And by that I mean truly unbelievable. The tales of excess and debauchery come across with little conviction and credibility. And after reading for the umpteenth time about Anthony `getting laid', `shooting up', `getting busted', etc, not only do the little yarns become somewhat tedious but one also starts to wonder if they indeed actually happened. So much so that even after the second attempt at reading this book I gave up altogether.If you want read a good autobiographical account of people going over the edge in the music biz read The Dirt or Wonderland Avenue.Scar Tissue is badly written, has little story development and is altogether bland.Anthony should stick to what he knows best.Avoid!"
1,Um....,"I have always been a fan. I just wish to read the positive side of being a multimillionaire. The world has too much negativity and tragedy. Come on Anthony, let's not contribute to it. We all know about your amazing path and how you trashed it. Welcome back and may you find peace. Just don't abuse consumers with public information for profit."
4,Purple light,"Two big highlights of this book:1. The language - sharp, funny, relaxed style, not convoluted, not trying too hard - the street language and the descriptions are hilarious2. The tales of addiction - this is the core of the book, his description of his addiction. He doesn't dwell on the horrors, but he also doesn't get too religious in his sobriety - it's just a sympathetic, believable story. And the insight into the lying, coniving mind of a 'dope fiend' makes great reading.I love the description of the seedy motel on Sunset, with the wicked purple light out front - tempting even the most reformed addict."
5,It will take you to a Paralell Universe,The book was awesome. Easy reading all the way...like a vacation for the mind. If you like the peppers check this book out. Dont mess with the 800 pound gorilla.
2,"Drugs, Teenage Sex, Drugs, TeenageSex and more drugs","Anthony details his daily search for drugs, going over a period of about 20 years. In between the drugs, he has these girlfriend relationships that are similar to the ones we had in 9th grade - pledging our ""one-ness"" and having a lot of male-gratifying sex.They say that drug and alcohol addiction ""freezes"" the maturity of the addict to early teen years, and this book is pure proof of it.I like Anthony - he's not a bad guy - and I hope he will now focus on writing, working and helping others, as well as staying sober, and hopefully, through the process, go from 14 to 40.I just wish I had half of the money he spent on drugs...ugh, what a waste of success..."
4,Scar Tissue,"I loved this book, mostly because I am a huge Peppers fan. The writing is just ok, but the stories are fasinating! A quick read."
5,"An unexpected, but interesting read!",""" Scar Tissue"" is undoubtedly one of the most unusual books I have ever read. The story itself is very interesting. Lead singer of RHCP Anthony Kiedis tells his audience about his childhood, going from michigan to being with his very laid back father in California. As the story progresses, he reveals trouble he runs into with girls, drugs and with establishing a truly original band way before its time. Although most of the story seemed a little repetitive and the ending was somewhat disappointing, I thought the book was great. I would reccommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read."
3,Worth reading if your a RHCP fan,"I like his band but to be honest after reading this I don't particuarly like Keidis as a person, which is surprising because my perception of him before reading this was that he seemed like a nice guy. He really comes off as a backstabbing, thieving, hustler, druggie scumbag. It gets a bit monotomous towards the end but its worth reading if your a Chili Peppers fan."
5,Scar Issue,"It is so hard whenyou can't look into your own eyescause that's where u see the personyou mostly- despiseSo be honestdon't threat don't preachyour spiritual embraceand love will reachA scar is a place to startNew stories overcoming the old fearsand old glories.There is no Holywood sweetener most are used to,expect nothing but raw emotional poetics that will question your wounds, your principles and your ethics. The beautiful person who has almost discovered himself will start you on a jorney to- yourself."
1,The Bad far out weighed the good,"I like the red hot chili pepper's and I like autoabiographies. That being said this one is slow, not well organized and uinspiring. I kept reading, convinced that it had to get better, unfortunately, it never did. It took me 3 weeks to get through, when a book never takes me longer than a few days. Anthony Kedis should stick to making music."
2,No real insights here,"I read this book a few years ago mainly because I liked the Red Hot Chili Peppers then and hoped to find out more about their creative process. That information is only marginally in the book. The biggest part is taken up by talking about drug addiction and sexual escapades. The main thing I remember now about the book, and it bothers me whenever it pops up in my mind, are passages where he not only talks about his own exploits but also those of other people. Washing other people's dirty laundry in public is pretty low in my view. It seems he is trying to say 'Look, I did some bad stuff but so did others. If you judge me you'll have to judge them too'. Disappointing."
2,peace and love and... a lotta loathsome,"honestly newsweek found the book ""inspiring""? oh hell yeah, it even tells you exactly where to go in LA for heroin and crack cocaine...honestly, nothing but gloating on the part of this once attractive carcass about rampant drug abuse and noookie nookie nookie, oops I mean the ""strong beautiful women"" in his life... (retch)not impressed..."
4,What I Like About Scar Tissue,"In this dissertation on the first forty years of his time on planet earth, Anthony Kiedis neither glorified his life(style) nor used what he had to say about it as a platform to make the point, ""See how low I sank?"" Kiedis was simply honest and left, one frequently gets the impression, nothing unmentioned in this memoir about a creative, sometimes sleazy life that was filled with risk-taking, extreme drug abuse, and excesses of every sort. Kiedis is a bright man with a questioning nature who doesn't try to hide anything he did along the way to where he is today, an unlikely survivor and spiritual pilgrim. Scar Tissue tells about death, crime, fame, music, sex, pain, loss, the celebrated and the infamous, and provides us with the ultimate backstage pass to twenty years of existence within The Red Hot Chili Peppers."
5,Scar Tissue,"Wonderful read. I felt I was watching each seedy scene from a window, wiping away the fog to peer into a world so vastly different from my own. Those Hollywood Hills are almost visible from my Mississippi home."
4,This book is Red Hot,"I am reading this book now and it is fantastic, If you are a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan you got to read it, It tells you the history of the band and him. You really see how his childhood is filled with drugs and sexual things. We see how his life is scared such as the title of the book refers. We see how it effects him. We see how women play a big role in his life because he talks about that most of the book, it is basically him in a band and life with girls. Excellent biography, very intresting, not for teens under 13 a lot of swaering and refers a lot to sex. Go out and buy this book. Has amazing pictures also. Also tells you how some songs came to be."
1,what an a%hole,"As with Keith Richards and ""Life"", this book merely shows someone living their life as an unbelievably self-centred, selfish f%ing ahole, applying radically different standards to themselves than they apply to others. Do you have to be an a%hole to be a rock star?"
3,"Smooth read, but what an idiot","I found the pages whizzing by, found the insight into rock stardom and addiction fascinating. But I wanted to brain the singer with a two-by-four when for the umpteenth time, sure enough, he's back on the drugs. You have rock-stardom, the world your oyster, and what do you do with it? Why not blast yourself away with some crack.You must give points for honesty, but the singer sounds like a bit of a sociopath, a morally bankrupt human being whose music I can appreciate, though the man himself would not be welcome in my house. I am not surprised Hillel's relatives blame Keidis for Hillel's death, incidentally, and am less surprised by Keidis describing their blame as ""disgusting"". Kiedis sounds like he still has a couple of decades growing up to do, and if I'm expected to believe he's stayed clean of drug use, pull the other one.In short, good entertainment, but maybe for bad reasons, and there's little profundity or insight to be found in this book."
5,A definite must-read,I have read this book several times and had my 20 year old wanna-be rock star read it also. Keidis is brutally honest and that takes chutzpah. Love this book!
3,A tale of a harrowing life,"Anthony Kiedis' autobiography is a glimpse into the mind of a hardcore drug addict. He was destined to have a drug problem, given his early years. People who complain that he was stupid or selfish for continuing to use drugs in the face of all their negative consequences are failing to understand the mechanics of addiction. Addicts don't quit for good until they hit rock bottom, and Kiedis had several false bottoms to hit before he hit his final rock bottom. It's a very interesting existance, but he doesn't glamourize it. He comes across as a very lonely little boy, and it's quite telling that his bandmates all have wives, kids, or steady girlfriends, and Anthony lives with two dogs."
5,Loved this book!,"This book really surprised me. I thought it was well written, thoroughly researched and has made Anthony Kiedes much more human to me and not some cartoonish lead singer for one of the best bands to come out of LA in 20 years. Kudos to you! You did a fabulous job of it."
5,Amazing Story!!!,"I feel more connected to Anthony, like I know him. He has had some tough, crazy, psychedelic, sexual, and inspiring times. He will forever be a punk-rock kid!"
5,excellent!,"i got my book very quick and it came just as it was described. i was very happy, thank you!"
5,Amazing book. Made me a fan.,I bought this for a friend who love the Red Hot Chili Peppers. On the subway ride home I started reading it just to pass the time and quickly became engrossed in it. I actually made her wait until I was done to give it to her.I had always kind of liked the band but after reading this book I have a much deeper appreciation for Anthony Kiedis and RHCP. This book made me a fan of their music.
1,Sir Pyscho Sexy indeed,"I was looking forward to Kiedis' book, having been a RHCP's fan from way back. What a disappointment. Kiedis brags about his sex life endlessly, I found myself looking forward to his next relapse back onto drugs to relieve the monotomy of what sexual act some random chick performed on him. Kiedis occasionally showcases his masterful (ahem)lyric writing ability by displaying some of his lyrics throughout the book. Thank you Mr Kiedis for highlighting the true talents of the RHCP."
4,"Good book, though over explained at times","Overall the book was very entertaining. The RHCP have had a wild ride with drugs, sex, and rock n roll over the years as explained in this book. Anthony talks about his struggle with addiction, his issues with women, and problems with other band members. He also tells some stories that I never would have though possible, such as the time he met the Dalai Lama. At times it did seem to get a little slow because it was a little over explained on some issues. However the good outweighed the bad."
5,Loved This Book,"Did you ever read a book and were sad when it ended? That's how this book was for me. It's so well written, so emotionally gut-wrenching and really a great inside look at the band, but mostly at the demons that drug-addicts live with. Amazing."
3,"Pretty good,but could be better",Great look into the trials and tribulations of the band but kiedis' writing is secular...playing music get high go to rehab and do it all again. It also shows what a womanizer he is
3,Tedious,"I must admit that I have not finished reading this book yet. I am a big fan of the Chili Peppers but not rabid like tattoo on my ankle kind of fan. I have most of their CDs but have not seen them in concert yet (not for lack of trying though). I was intrigued about a short synopsis in which Kiedis speaks of his tendency to destroy his body with drugs and then seeking out the healthiest foods. I purchase the book on my kindle to read as we were traveling across country. I was hooked in the first chapter. The following narrative about a life of freedom, excess in drugs and sex were riveting. But I stalled a little over half way through. It became tedious and really very similar to the antics of any addict except of course Kiedis is famous. I am really hoping to return to the book over the Christmas break and wrap this up but this is the first time I have not read a book cover to cover in one sitting. I will hopefully return to this review and update it with more stars."
3,"Not fantastic, but not bad either.","Well, this is definitely a Suikoden game. Mechanically, it's got everything it's supposed to have, 108 stars, recruitment binges, battles, random fights, everything you've grown to expect from the franchise.Problem is, it doesn't offer much we haven't already seen. Yes, you can make your own accessories, and having three battle groups at one time on your base is pretty darned nifty, but that's about it. There's just not much new going on here.I won't go into too much more detail about the game's shortcomings, as they really aren't all that glaring. There's just not much going on in this game to set it apart from the others.On the other hand, this is probably the most visually pleasing game in the series, and has something of a surprise ending, if you're paying attention.I'd recommend it over S3, which I never finished playing.Warts and all, it's a pretty decent little game. Emphasis on little."
1,Horrible...,"I loved the Suikoden series, but for some reason, Konami felt they needed to change the formula after Suikoden 2. The result ended up producing a mediocre Suikoden 3 and a terrible Suikoden 4. This game is completely uninteresting. I could not even get all the way through it because of a storyline that called for meandering on a boat in the middle of the ocean for several hours of gameplay. Save your money when it comes to this one. Konami has produced much better."
4,Give it a chance,"I love Suikoden I & II and I really enjoyed 3. So far, IMHO Suikoden IV is shaping to be one of, if not the best, chapters in this series. Even though we're only about 3 hours into the game, the story is very compelling. The characters that we've encountered so far are very well rounded and developed.I suggest that the last reviewer play more than an hour of the game before making such negative comments"
4,Great stories for the Ellison fan,"This collection of stories is a must read for those who treasure to work of Ellison. In these short works, the voice that would give us Invisible Man can be seen developing. They are not as powerful or as deep as his great novel, but they do offer an entertaining and meaningful read. The lengthy introduction is informative and insightful. When I first read Invisible Man, I could swear that I heard jazz as I read. Callahan explains Ellison's musical background which convinces me that I heard the jazz in Ellison's words by design. These works carry the same music."
3,"Uneven, but good for Ellison fans","I read this book recently after devouring Invisible Man. I have to say, though, that I was a little dissappointed by this book. Curiously enough, a lot of these stories weren't published in Ellison's lifetime, and with some of them, it's evident why. A few of the stories are juvenile, not at all comparable to Invisible Man, and by the same token, a few of them are spectacular pieces of prose. So, with this volume, I advise you to tread carefully, but read it all the way through. The gems are worth it, despite the failures."
2,trying hard/ boaring,track list:Kiss You Back (Smack On The Cheek Mix)4:25Kiss You Back (LP Mix)6:12Kiss You Back (Full French Kiss Mix)6:59Kiss You Back (Smackapella Mix)5:14
4,"Tight, catchy song","Well the song's from Digital Underground, so you know it's gonna be one of those tight and catchy songs to dance to. Check it out!"
5,Wonderful!,"Marcia Adams has produced the most beautiful, authentic Amish/Mennonite cookbooks available. I haven't found any recipes that call for canned soups or recipes that are not ""real"" foods that you would find on the tables of the Amish or Mennonite people. The books contain information that provides a greater understanding of this culture. The photos are breath-taking. Just wonderful, wonderful books."
3,conddition of book,The contents were fine but the condition of the book was awful. I can't understand anyone treating a book that way.
5,"Great recipes, pictures, and unique view of the Amish people","I have all of Marcia Adams' Amish cookbooks - the recipes are very clear as well as delicious, and her sketches of Amish life are extraordinary. This cookbook is the best of the lot. The stereotypes of ""Witness"" are not here - these women are real, and they deal with the trials of everyday life (children, housekeeping, cooking, husbands, etc.) just as the rest of us do. The pictures that accompany the text are as good as the recipes, and the recipes are wonderful (try the Perfect Pie Pastry on p. 270 - absolutely foolproof). This is as wonderful a book as it is a cookbook - read and enjoy!"
3,Pretty but fragile,"I love how these dishes look - I bought red, yellow, and blue - but they chip very easily and have started fading after only a few months use. Also, they get very HOT - when heating up water in the microwave for tea, I have to let the handle cool for a pretty long time before taking it out. Also, the bottom was so hot, it left a heat ring on my wood table through the coaster!"
4,What's Theology got to do with it?,Lots of good substance. Less engaging than some books I have read - but I am finding ideas and reminders that will influence my thinking and preaching. Could have been edited in some places to get to the central message.
3,"Not one of their best, but still Great fun.","This film recycles all the jokes from A and C meet Frankenstein, but this time they've lost some of their shine. Frankenstein had 3 bad guys for the boys to contend with, (Frankenstein, Dracula and the Wolfman) this film, like A and C meet the mummy, suffers from its audience having already seen better. (A and C meet the Invisible Man is the only one that doesn't suffer from this, because the jokes are fresh and Original) All that aside the boys still constantly have me laughing. Anyone who loves Abbott and Costello NEED to own this movie."
4,"Best of A+C ""Meet"" series.","Feeble, older, and worn-out comedians Bud and Lou prove that they can still handle their material well. A fun, classic film for the entire family that kids and adults alike can watch without feeling guilty. Not as good as their 1940s hits, but not without amusing scenes."
4,IT RANKS RIGHT UP THERE WITH A&C MEET FRANKENSTEIN!!,"WONDERFUL ENTRY IN THE A&C MEET THE MONSTERS SERIES OF MOVIES. VERY GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS OF KARLOFF CHANGING INTO MR.HYDE. KARLOFF'S PRESENCE ALONE MAKES THIS MOVIE WORTH WATCHING,BUT COUPLED WITH THE COMEDIC TALENTS OF ABBOTT & COSTELLO IN MY OPINION MAKE IT AN INSTANT CLASSIC. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF A&C OR THE UNIVERSAL MONSTER MOVIES THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE!!"
2,Special effects and shopworn slapstick poorly mixed.,"Abbott and Costello may have been one of the all time great comedy teams, but this effort does not do them justice. The whole thing seems lifeless, as they were doing it simply to meet a contractual obligation with Universal Pictures. Director Charles Lamont cannot hide the movie's low budget (shots are recycled so many times that it becomes painful to see), obviously all the money went to the transformation and monster effects. Your time would be better spent with A&C meet Frankenstein."
3,This video was OK,"This video was OK, but it had too much of the war games of '98, when that was the worst war games. They should of put in some better matches too. Fall Brawl '97 was, with out a doubt, the best Fall Brawl ever, but it had it's worst match! I should have shown the Eddy Guerrero vs. Chris Jericho match, and the '97 war games! Plus, it should of had some matches from Fall Brawl '93. So this video was OK, but not great!"
1,this movie is so stupid,THIS MOVIE IS NOT EVEN WORTH $050.it hasnone of the good matches from fall brawlit just has the dumbest matches i haveever seen in my whole life of watchingwrestling. if i could i would give thismovie 0 stars and 2 thumbs down.Do you smell what the rock is cookin? The only thing I smelled in this movie was stink.
3,Night Watch po Angliski,"This was an English, Spanish, French only disk, not Russian.Was disappointed not to be able to listen to the Russianwith English subtitles. Day Watch offered the Russian version.Otherwise, I enjoyed both DVDs."
4,True SCIFI fans!,Both of these movies are like nothing you can expect. The director has taken the viewer on a cinematic adventure through his mind. Watch both movies in order and I promise you will not be disappointed.
3,"Met the special effects requirement, but the story left me a little lost...","Well, because I like special effects, maybe Russian humor doesn't translate well. Still I liked both movies. Two movies that do need to be together."
1,Not my cup of tea,"I don't know why people rated this so highly (Evil Dead was another one). I thought it was amateurish and boring. If they are supposed to be so bad that they are ""campish"" I might understand it, but if it was meant to be a serious attempt at scaring me, fugedaboutit. I quickly donated it to Goodwill."
3,a mess but an enthralling one,"These first two parts of the trilogy are, honestly, a mess. Visually there is too much happening and the steps the story takes almost make zero sense. When you strip it down to its basics--good vs. evil--it does work. When the director gets into flashbacks or parallel worlds it just gets wonky.Having said that, the shots of Russian city streets at night are mindblowingly great. The B-movie vampire/werewolf/shapeshifter babe factor should be upgraded when the director does the third part of this trilogy.I will give Count Floyd (the lead actor is a dead ringer for SCTV's Joe Flaherty) props.The English dub of Night Watch is decent in addition to being able to watch it in the original Russian. I still found Day Watch a far more linear story and had a much more understandable setup.If you're a fan of the Matrix, you'll dig this series. Vampire movie fans, I think you'll be left wanting more."
1,Don't waste your time,"I have read the entire Daywatch series twice. I was incredibly excited to find out that they had been translated into film. That didn't last long. They completely destroyed the series. Even if you haven't read the books, such as my girlfriend, these movies are a complete disappointment. You have no idea what's going on half the time. This is the worst film adaptation I have ever seen. I would pay somebody not to watch these movies. The books are amazing though so I highly recommend reading them."
3,Day/Night Watch Cool concept,"The film is quite good. Better that I expected for a foreign fantasy film.I suggest getting the two DVD pack to view the whole story.I believe there is a third component in book form available as well.Special effects are good, but too few. The car racing across the front of a building was very good.I bought this because the concept of a truce between the forces of good an evil maintained in today's world intrigued me.The characters are interesting.But I must say that I was lost looking for the motivations behind some of the characters.I attribute this to cultural differences.I think a Hollywood remake would make it a major film."
1,save your money,"if you buy this movie based from the great preview like I did you are making a mistake. the previews are the only scenes like that, no more action just boring stuff. I sold it on Amazon the next day!"
3,Less for the general population,"Dhyana Buddhism, also known as Ch'an or Zen (or Son, in this case) is a complicated subject and I recommend that the reader take some courses before reading. The first half puts Chinul's life into perspective by a nice introduction into Korean history, which was much appreciated. The rest of the book was almost intensely doctrinal, and would only be of interest to students of the Buddha. However, fair warning: anyone who thinks Buddhists aren't as likely to be corrupt as are Christians and Muslims will be terribly let-down by some of the revelations herein."
5,I hate everyone? Yes please,"This childrens story is a wonderfull teaching tool for all young children. The message is simple, and the pages beautifuly illistrated. It is now in my home, as well as my daughters classroom. I highly recommend this to anyone young or old,who needs a little reminder of how far being nice will get you."
1,No good!!!,I am very displeased with this purchase due to the fact that the wrong disc was sent in the right package.
5,Brother Bob is the MAN!!!!!!!!,This album is one of the best album ever produce by the Tuff Gong Label.Brother Bob sounds just make you want to keep listening.When I put my Cd in I did not want to take it out.It is a great mixture of songs...
4,Beware the Spider Tea Kettle!,"When my friends and I found this old, beat up VHS tape with no jacket and the words ""Ninja Wars"" written on the label at our local video store for $4 it was too hard to resist.What then followed is pure ninja gold. It's very similar to Shogun Assassin in that although this movie may once have been half credible in it's original Japanese language version the English dub is completely ludicrous.From narators preaching the virtues and powers of the Spider Tea Kettle to the machinations of the mysterious Kashin Koji this movie has it all. Violence! Gore! Beheadings! Naked Women! Ninjas!Uncover the secrets of the Diamond Hand Technique! Learn how to make magic potions using the tears of an abused woman! Discover to how to speak weird orange bile into the face of your enemies!B-Grade re-dubbed ninja action at it's best!Don't delay folks flash that cash.Hit the purchase button.Order your copy of Ninja Wars today!"
2,pOSSIBLT THE WORST MOVIE THAT i SAT ALL THE WAY THROUGH,"This movie is just weird. I think that they were looking for 2 knives in this. I'm sure the plot had a little more to it, bu tthis was just god-awful. The only thing I loved in this movie was the nudity, and there is a lot of it. WARNING- there is a fat chick and she has THE BIGGEST FLOPPERS I HAVE EVER SEEN.So it stars sonny chiba and his favorite protoge, but the action sucks. maybe this movie was just a huge letdown bacause I had just watched shogun's ninja. I didn't think shogun's ninja was all that good, certainly not a classic, but it was a hell of a lot better than ninja wars. And if you wanna see a really great MOVIE, check out shogun's samurai."
2,Non-Dubbed version is no fun,Its a known fact that the dubbed version of this movie is a comedy. The non-dubbed version of this movie is no fun. Its just a bad kung fu movie that takes itself too seriously. I wish the DVD came in the dubbed version so we could make fun of it.
3,once isn't enough,"The Disney movie is great, but I advise true BnB fans to get the musical soundtrack. The added songs: ""Home"" and ""If I Can't Love Her"" are absolutely fabulous and all of the cast are extremely talented. I recommend this sdtrk to anybody who loves a love story, great music and lyrics, or...well, I'd recommend it to anybody! =)"
2,Perfect for any little girl!,"Bought this for my 2 year old niece. It plays every time they get into the car! Songs are catchy, bouncy and addictive. If you loved the movie, this is perfect for the car, office or workout. Totally recommend!"
4,Enjoyable AND Enchanting!,"I mostly purchased it as a Christmas presents for one of my younger cousins, but I think the music for this film is very well. I like how some of it was creepy like in ""Prologue"" or ""West Wing"". And my cousin who got this CD loves the movie and music itself, or the songs at least. Nevertheless, this is a product I don't regret purchasing."
5,Pure Genius,"Beauty and The Beast is a must have for all Disney fans. Brilliantly constructed songs like ""Something There"" (I believe most often overlooked) adds to the amazing score. ""West Wing"" is probably the best out of the score part of BATB. It takes you into that lonely castle and adds an emotional atmosphere to the recording. The soundtrack is pure genius.Another must have Menken and Ashman album that hasn't dated."
4,Fantastic soundtrack!,I love this CD! It's like I'm watching the movie but I'm able to get on and do other things at the same time. The only thing is that it would be cool if the songs were actually in the order that they are in the movie.
2,Belle's singing...ouch,"The songs are well-written but Belle's voice could peel paint.If you want a real scare, listen to her sing in The Enchanted Christmas. There are some notes that she hits ( or doesn't hit) that will send you running out of your living room.New.... and a bit alarming....( ouch!)"
5,One of my favorite Disney soundtracks,"Being a college student, I grew up with Disney classics like Lion King, Hercules, Toy Story, and Aladdin, but surprisingly I was never exposed to Beauty and the Beast. I just decided to watch it a few weeks ago actually since I heard it was one of Disney's greatest animations of the 90s as well as the fact that I heard part of the soundtrack and instantly fell in love with the music. The music is simply unforgettable from Gaston's egotistical theme song, to the enchanting Beauty and the Beast. Of course, the instrumental music is kind of hunting and great for this darker Disney film. My favorite song would have to be Gaston simply because it fits his character so perfectly and the lyrics are so catchy, hairy chest, 5 dozen eggs, size of a barge anyone. This is definitely a classic and one of the best soundtracks to one of the best Disney movies of the 90s. Its up there with Lion King and Aladdin."
1,Borke after 20 minutes,We thought Crumplezone was great until it broke just 20 minutes after opening the package. The guns would no longer lock in place in either mode. We returned it to the store but were afraid to get another of the same because of its poor durability.
5,Great soundtrack!,This is a wonderful soundtrack with a wide variety of sound. There are even some tracks that I had not heard in the game before.I like this song collection enough that I am going to buy the second CD with sounds from WofLK.
2,Flimsy,"This belt buckle is cheap, but also nearly worthless. The ""C"" portion is single-sided thin metal that bends and cuts, tearing clothing and skin that it rubs against. Get something better than this!"
2,Flimsy,"I ordered belt buckles form other stores on amazon for $3 and they were real metal. This belt buckle was far from metal, I can bend it with my hands. This buckle is extremely flimsy."
2,Just for Snapshots,"If I had had the chance to use this camera for a day or two before I bought it, it wouldn't have been ""bought"". It really is just for snapshots of birthday parties and wading pools. Black and White photos were a disappointment--the color was all off. Enlargements were not sharp and landscapes or distance photos were ill defined. I wouldn't buy it again--which means that I will be buying something else soon, so it was a waste of money."
2,Only for beginners,"The book provides the basic ""terms & rules"" of stock trading and tries to go deeper in trading small companies stock and IPO's as well as some basic indicators supposed to guide investing decisions. Well, maybe the timing is not right but I don't find something new or interesting. Perhaps it's good for the beginner..."
1,Save your money,Save your money. Just take the $3.99 you were going to spend to watch this movie and go get lunch. Why anyone would spend any amount of money to mass-produce or pay Amazon to put it on their web site is beyond all comprehension.
4,Gritty,"Wonderful film. There's violence, but not so graphic that it's difficult to watch. A surprise or two during the movie kept it interesting. It also helps that most of the actors are pretty cute, too. Especially Wayne Virgo. This is one film that I think I'll definitely purchase. Brings up some controversial issues, and it was a very appreciated deviation from your standard coming of age story, It also digs into other areas of homosexuality, and love between two men."
2,VERY DARK,"If you like movies with happy endings this one isn't for you. On the other hand if you are interested in a movie that has mercy killing, evil run amuck, brutality, etc. with a love story somehow woven into the fabric of the film then you might enjoy this."
3,Sad Ending,About a prison guard and prisoner having a relationship while in prison and the gangs that oppose it. Sad ending.
2,Nothing speacial about this,This should be free. The plot the movie itself is NOT special. The content is NOT worth the price. Please consider this as a free movie.
2,Watched this thing twice,"I have watched this film twice, and it is sad on so many levels. The ending is as obvious as an on-coming train, and just about as troubling. Like another reviewer, I could not determine what the writer and director were going for, relative to genre or even the point they wanted to make. There are way too many dream sequences and flashbacks. Why do so many directors believe that non-linear storytelling is artful? I have no idea, but this film's director clearly buys that line of thinking. On the positive side, the acting is first rate and the principle actors are easy on the eyes."
2,Cat Chews Every Pair Right Off,"I really wanted these to work and heard good things about them, but unfortunately they are a useless waste of $$ for us. Every time we put them on, our cat spends the next several hours chewing them off. She is extremely persistent with this. Instead, we provided her with several different scratching posts with a variety of material, sprinkle catnip on them, and introduce her to their purpose by raising her legs and putting her paws on them in a scratching motion. We also put strips of packing tape on the areas of the stairs she is scratching. This has worked for the past year. I hope the caps work for you. If not, try these others methods."
4,They do work. You just have to give it time for the cats to get used to them.,"It's takes some patience, but we really needed to protect the furniture so we stuck with it. You go through a lot of them in the beginning as you get used to putting them on and they get used to wearing them. Wish they would provide more of the skinning glue tops, since you can't reuse them -- especially when you only need to replace one nail."
2,They dont stay on,These would be ideal if they stayed on. My cat found a way to get them off 3x. I finnally gave up. I was very disappointed.
4,Christmas present,This was a Christmas present for my great niece and she loved it and played with it as soon as it was opened. Love the fact that it is washable.
5,Very tasty!,"The product description is very accurate. I received my item in a timely manner and the items were well packaged and still frozen. The portions are large and are very easy to prepare in the oven. And, of course, the Chicken Cordon Bleu has a wonderful, savory taste that isn't skimpy on either the ham or cheese.If I could rate 4.5 stars I would, simply due to price. However, don't let price stop you from ordering....these are delicious."
2,Great Composition - Not the Original Music from the Movies,"Since I am a self proclaimed movie fanatic and avid movie score purchaser, I have many of the albums and songs in their original format. I looked at Reel Chill as being a good way to bring them all together on one album. These are the original compositions - but NOT the original music as heard and performed for the movies.I was looking for that emotion you feel when listening to the music from a significant film, and it just wasn't there when it's a 'remake' from another orchestra.I won't knock the music - it's beautifully performed, but if you're looking for that 'exact' sound as heard in the movie (A.I., Chariots of Fire, etc) - this is NOT the album."
3,Not as pictured!,"These socks are very cute, but they're not exactly as pictured. The blue and green ones are close -- the colors are the same, but they have the brand name written in puffy paint (presumably non-skid) on both sides of the sock bottom. The yellow and green socks also have the paint on the soles, and look much more dull than the picture -- the picture has a bright yellow, but the actual socks are more of a pastel yellow. Disappointing, but the socks overall are very cute and seem pretty comfortable."
4,Good Ayurvedic treatise,"I especially like the details, especially regarding dual dosha (for insance, Pitta/Vata) dietary guidelines. She includes many foods that aren't often in other Ayurvedic books. A good book to add to one's library."
3,Not nearly enough,It only has three real movies in it. The rest is pretty low quality filler. Even the Jerry Seinfeld bit wasn't that good. He just didn't even look like he actually liked Abbott and Costello. It should have been priced lower at least...half the price of the other sets and then I would have been ok with it.
2,Short on laughs,"While in Egypt, Peter and Freddie (Abbott and Costello) get involved with a walking mummy, his cult followers, and a cursed medallion.That's a pretty short summary, but honestly, that's all there is to this disappointing comedy. Abbott and Costello were past their prime in 1955 and the film shows it. The jokes aren't much unless you think endless punchlines with ""mummy"" instead of ""mommy"" and snake charmers with rubber snakes are funny. Abbott yells too much at Costello and they both are barely going through the motions; in fact, they call each other ""Bud"" and ""Lou"" throughout. The ridiculous casting of Richard Deacon (""Mel Cooley"" inThe Dick Van Dyke Show) and Michael Ansara (TV's ""Cochise"") as Egyptian mummy-worshippers makes the story even more far-fetched. It's about thirty minutes too long and plays like a bad SNL skit. Definitely not one of their best."
4,amusing family film,"The difference between comedies of the past and ""family"" movies of today is their ability to be good entertainment for everyone w/o being hokey. Bud and Lou are in fine form in this, one of their last films. Everyone will enjoy this wonderfully funny film. Look for the ""Take Your Pick"" bit, one of those classic Abbott and Costello routines."
3,Three films? I'll wait,"I'm not sure what I expected from this final collection from Universal. but this was the pits. Three movies? And two highlight reels. Plus the bonus feature from the original Meet Frankenstein DVD. Slim pickings. Shame they couldn't get ""It Ain't Hay"" in the collection. I'm going to have to wait until the price drops before I can justify buying the set."
5,Any A & B is good,As all Abbot and Costello movies I find this one funny and cute. I like the simplicity and wholesomeness of their movies.
3,Not As Entertaining As When They Met Frankenstein,"I rented this one because I really liked Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and wanted to see another of their meeting with a horror icon. This one isn't nearly as entertaining, although how could it have been as entertaining when Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein when that had not only Frankenstein, but Dracula and The Wolfman as well. All this one has is The Mummy lumbering around after those two lovable lugs Bud Abbott & Lou Costello. Still, this one has its moments."
4,"The Same Routine, but still funny and well made","This Abbott and Costello movie didn't get many good reviews, probably because it plays too much like Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein or anything else they have done. While a lot of the jokes can be repetitive.Still, these two were fun to watch, especially on the same screen as monsters like the Mummy. While for comedies, these movies had surprisingly nice costumes and set pieces. I'm not sure what's not to like about anything Abbott and Costello did."
1,abbot and costello meet the mummy,"[ASIN:B00005LC4C Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy] This is a terrible movie. The dialogue was inane, the slapstick was idiotic, drawn out and repetitive and the acting so wooden to the point where the only reason this sorry excuse for a movie was made was to capitalize and profit on the Abbot and Costello name. As opposed to the top quality of ""Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein"" with it's superior characters, plot and monsters, this cheap rip-off doesn't even have a decent Mummy character,(a guy in a jump suit with duct tape attached, big deal!) or any talented actors and special effects for that matter. If you must see this movie check it out from the library. Buying or renting it is a waste of money."
3,My favorite A&C movie.,Saw these and liked them as a kid in the 1950's. My kinds don't care for them. This is the one i liked the best.
2,Yikes! The comedy is kept under wraps here...,"The Abbott and Costello films fit into one of two categories; really good or really bad. Sadly, this film sits in the later camp. I'm not sure what the screenwriters and Bud & Lou were thinking when they concocted this strange mishmash of bad comedy and bad horror. The Universal Mummy films were always the weakest of their horror films (the exception is the eerie but really slowwwwww first film with Boris Karloff. It's only alive in the very beginning).I'd suggest sticking with the first and best of this bunch A&C Meet Frankenstein. All the later films (including Dr. Jekell & Mr. Hyde)are little more than pale imitations.Any A&C film is only as good as their routines. This one, sadly, doesn't have very inspired ones. The best involving the tools is a pale imitation of the who's on first variety. They don't make them like this anymore (on second thought....what about all those Halloween and Friday The 13th sequels? They're not comedies? What?)"
5,NOLA_UPT3,If you're a tru fan these are some of their greatest a must have Abbott and Costello and their best wish a few more was on here but it's a good start.
3,disregard for the fans and collectors,"It's indeed great to have the last few films on this final collection (Jekyll and Hyde in particular), but why is this volume with less discs and less movies MORE expensive than the other volumes? And even worse, neither the packaging nor the discs themselves give ANY indication as to which movies are on which sides of each disc. You have to pop them into your dvd player and wait for the menu to come up to find out. Blatant mistreatment of these precious films..."
3,"Boy, Are We Spoiled","A couple of years ago if somebody announced that 3 A&C films, any 3 except the PD ones, and 3 documentaries would be available from Universal for less than $20 everyone would have dashed to buy it. However, since Universal put out 3 previous 8 film sets at fire sale prices suddenly this seems like a bad deal. A&C Meet the Mummy was originally more expensive than this by itself. My rating is for the films included which are not among the team's best but this is still a great deal."
4,Very funny but don't waste your money!,"THE BEST OF ABBOTT AND COSTELLO: VOL. 4 is coming out on Oct. 4, 2005, and it has ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE, ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET JERRY SEINFELD, ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET THE KEYSTONE KOPS, ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET THE MONSTERS, ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET THE MUMMY, and THE WORLD OF ABBOTT AND COSTELLO. The vol. 4 will probably be a few more dollars than this one DVD but it will also include 5 other movies. SO DO NOT BUY THIS COPY."
2,A Cynical Autopsy,"Robert Jackall strings together a series of worse-case scenarios gleaned from a very limited control group of corporations. He skillfully manipulates language (e.g., calling loyalty to one's boss 'fealty') in order to deliver what he thinks is an indictment of bureaucracy. He does have some interesting things to say about the press, but this occurs near the end and comprises less than a page of material. Save your time. Read something worthwhile like Thomas Sowell's classic ""A Conflict of Visions."" Jackall's book is not worth the read."
2,Buy Fire of Love,"This is one of those CDs with the home recording, bad tracks and live songs. First of the home records sound like they where taped on a dirty tape recorder. The studio tracks are not on any real album cause they sound awful. Last lets face it Gun Club was one of the greatest bands to ever exist but they suck live. Every time I say them JLP was drunk and made no sense. They are great to watch live but you can not capture that feeling with a poor recording. This is great if you want to hear outtakes and stuff. I gave it 2 stars because it has some historical value. If you really want to hear a great Gun Club album by Fire of Love."
5,You Won't Forget Him,"Every day, we hear names of business giants such as Bill Gates or John D. Rockefeller. But what we don't hear is the story of what makes or made these men who they were. How they lived. Who they loved. What inspired them.What they ate for breakfast.Conversations With Papa Charlie gave me a real look behind the scenes at Charles E. Smith--one of the biggest names in real estate. I discovered who Charles E. Smith really was--his successes, his failures and lessons--not just for business but for life.It is a magical and charming memoir that I would recommend for anyone of any age who wants to be inspired."
5,Delightful!,"This recording is absolutely delightful! I first bought this record when I was 18, shorly before I went into the Army. When I was stationed at Ft Gordon, GA, to my suprise I heard it on a radio, a huge console stereo in the dayroom, probably was on a National Public Radio type broadcast station. The recording burned in a fire about 8 years later. Then about 22 years later while stationed in South Korea, I found a copy of this record at a record shop, in perfect condition. The voice of John Shirley-Quirk singing this is the best recording I've heard of Ralph Vaughan William's Five Mystical Songs."
4,psalm 86,"I have only heard the Psalm on radio 3 and was struck by its refreshing arrangement. A single male voice (of considerable range) is balanced against a treble chorus singing in deceptively simple harmony at times, lightly accompanied by a small ensemble. The variety of texture, dynamics and orchestration is compelling to hear and much to be recommended for ""bath""ing to!!"
5,The great Aladdin,This is one of the top three soundtracks of Disney films i have bought (The other 2 being The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast) Robin Williams is excellent as the genie-his best song being Friend Like Me and One Jump is also great. The only thing that is perhaps annoying with this (as with all Disney soundtracks) is that the sound effects are edited out. However I listen to this CD almost every week and still don't tire of it.
3,"Great soundtrack, sadly EDITED and CENSORED!","I was very excited to get this album since I lost my CD many years ago, but I was already saddened 30 seconds into the Arabian Nights song where he they censored out ""where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face"" with some lame ""where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense"" (wtf?) I should have read the reviews before buying, I would have hunted out the true original CD!That's the takeaway folks: you get the beauty of the soundtrack in straight 256kbps MP3 format and instantly, but you will lose the true original soundtrack. Frankly if Amazon would refund me I'd happily buy the original CD at the same price."
2,No ROBIN WILLIAMS!?!?!,"It's amazing that we are willing to pay for certain songs and they don't want to sell to us unless we buy the entire album! Very interested in ""Friend Like Me"" but unable to purchase.Aladdin"
3,Only One Worthwhile Song,"Unfortunately, there was only one worthwhile song on this CD for me. Of cousre, that would be ""Whole New World"". That is the reason I bought the CD and the only reason that I keep it. I listened to all the others, but without the movie, they fall short of self-standing entertainment. Ah, well, will just listen to it once a year (or less)."
2,Medium,"We purchased this item on March 21, 2008, we got a email saying that they had our payment had been rec'd. We didn't receive it until April 19th. It appears to be in good working order."
2,A soundtrack that needs to be seen.,"While the songs in Aladdin are very clever; they lack emotional depth. Brad Kane does a nice job on ""One Jump Ahead"", but Robin Williams' numbers are not as effective without the visual excitement found in the film. The romantic theme, ""A Whole New World,"" does not involve the listener in either of its incarnations, and while there are some interesting instrumentals, the overall effect is that the music does not stand on its own."
4,Good,This soundtrack takes you back to the Disney classic with a soaring rendition of A Whole New World by Lea Salonga.
4,Aladdin Review,"My disney-tacular CD came promptly and in very good condition. It comes with around 18 songs. I received everything, including the front pamphlet. Classic favorites like ""Whole New World"" are a favorite with family and friends on road trips and going anywhere in a car. Young children definately enjoy this cd.Who couldn't love Disney music?"
3,Ingenious but disappointing,"I found the writing flat compared to what George Eliot is really capable of. This story reads like a writing exercise, as if she set herself the task of producing an uncanny story."
2,what a bore,i'm sorry but this book did not capture my interest. i only finished it because i hate to stop reading a book before the end. i did not find it intriguing. it did have one or two interesting parts but that was it. i was very happy it was a short read. this is my first book by george eliot and hope the others are more impressive.
1,How do you make a bad thing worse?,"Eamon's song was unimpressive enough - anyone can string together obscenities and sing like a tortured hyena. But this person, ""Frankee"" (either a friend of Eamon or someone trying to cash in - NOT an ex) manages to add even more profanities and resorts to the kind of insults that you hear at the playground at elementary school - over the exact same song. I might not have written a review on this, but since this ""artist"" had to stoop to this level to gain publicity and was unable to do so on her own merits, I have to take her to task. Frankee - you made me do this!"
3,Better than what's-his-face...,"K, the lyrics here are comical, better than Eamon's and a good comeback. If Frankee isn't expectant of an entire career, this is fine. In the song, she calls her old flame out as being bad in bed and almost giving her crabs (EW). It's got a similar beat to ""F*** you, you b****, f*** you, you ho,"" w/e the hell his song is, which I actually liked. But the lyrics here beat it! I can't say the song itself is that strong but it does ignite the fire between this girl and her ex bf, if you get what I mean."
3,Good Song I guess.,"Good song. The girls a b**** though if everything in those songs are true. ANd uh. Thanks, mother of two kids, for not being able to turn off caps lock..."
1,"I'm sorry, HOW old are we?","This song is really wack. When I heard it I thought about the whole retaliation thing and I said, ""What is this, high school?"" And don't think I'm just siding with the guys here; I don't like Eamon's song either. On Eamon's version the lyrics were bad and the singing was worse; on Frankee's version the singing is decent but the lyrics are still bad. Like Eamon, I don't think Frankee is going to be around next year.Anthony Rupert"
2,**puh-leeze**,"Ya frankee is a good singer, but don't you think her words are a little harsh. I know Eamon deserved it becuase he did the same thing with her in his lyrics, but didn't you ever hear when someone hits you,you aren't suppose to hit back?......She cheated on him, and she just doesn't really think it is her fault. Come On!"
2,It's gd but she cud of done something else...,"Ok basically it's a good song, she can sing and it's a good idea to show two sides but the thing is it is a publicity stunt, she just wants to ruin eamon's career! it's obv she cheated and she need to accept it and the other thing is he might be getting back at her but surely she deserves it after cheating on him. i mean if it was me that had cheated i wudlnt be suprised him writing a song about me cos surely he'd deserve to say how he felt through music instead of in person, which cud be more hurtful???"
1,CRAP!,"This FURB is the dumbest Diss record/parody I've ever heard. This is a response and a parody of Eamon's ""F*** IT"" (Which is crap also). All this Frankee does with with song is complain about Eamon's Complaining. She can't sing either. You can tell by the lyrics of the two songs that the same people wrote both of them. This is Crap. You Know what : F*** Both of them. They can't sing worth a DAMN"
1,Eamon Rocks!!,"This song is crap........ if she's going to come back at him, she should try being a little more original!! Sure she's got a nice voice and everything, but hasn't she heard of remixing - it means using a different tune.Really., if she is Eamon's ex g/f then he said all the right things in his version of the song, she's just being a child by responding with such nonsense........why won't she just get over herself - she really is a SL*T!!Eamon's song ROCKS!!!"
2,"""the answer"" to Eamon","This is the female version of Eamon's big hit, but it's not as strong. You don't hear the singer's emotions and it's been produced like a quick shot."
1,*cough* SLUT *cough*,"i cant believe wut shes saying in that song! ill admit shes got a good voice but the things she says is obvious signs of a slut. like when she says she 'had' to do his friend like c'mon dude that doesnt make sence. u can totally tell that she gets passed around like a 10 dollar bill:P but if u want 2 buy (or download) a song like that go for it, but i personally hate this song cuz my ex-gf acted like that and i gots 2 many painful memories:|"
5,i love to see this sort of thing,"i totally loved this song and had to let the rest of you know about it!!! Its great to hear a girl get back at a guy when he has been slagging her off, and she does it so well!!!Its an entertaining song which i think all the girls will love and i think if eamon's song gets heard so should this one!!! ITS ONLY FAIR"
5,Geeee,"If you don't like a song, why waste your time complaning about it?Both songs are so much jokes, and even better is Capital Radios 'remix'.And those of you who say she doesn't have a good voice, what have you been listening too?What struck me about both songs was thats, despite the hilarious lyrics, both Frankee and Eamon have great singing voices.Maybe some people should listen properly....."
1,trying to hang myself with my belt after hearing this cr*p,"...OK everyone who says this girl rocks, reality check, she doesn't.What makes me sour over this patheric attempt is that she isn't Eamon's ex and for her to write that shows she doesn't mind people thinking she's a sl*t and then she carries on saying how much of a good Catholic girl she is????? Huh, 'Go figure that one out', I say.If she wanted any diginty in the music industry she wouldn't have brought out this insult-to-all-women of a song. Also she says that it's about girl power, I'm a female and i'm appauded by this stupid song. It has no girl power in it, it just proves how promiscous she is. She is doing nothing good for the female race and must be eraticated."
3,ENOUGH ALREADY,I AM THE MOTHER OF A 2 TEENS AND THEY BOTH LISTEN TO BOTH SONGS I REALLY DON'T CARE FOR THE F*** WORD BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE BEAT IS A GOOD ONE. AND PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER GOTTEN BACK AT EACH OTHER. IT IS JUST A FORM OF EXPRESSION .
2,lasted 4 months,"I've had this unit for about 4 months and just today had to take it in for service. I was making trim in a router table and (unknown to me) it overheated. Apparently there isn't any sort of thermal protection built into the motor.Even after cooling it off, it ran at 1/3 speed drawing about twice the normal amount of current. Internal inspection (forgetting for a moment that bit about disassembly by unauthorized service centers) revealed fairly severe pitting of the commutator in several places.In short, DeWalt would have been wise to include a thermal cutout ."
3,Definitely not one size,"First off, let me say I LOVE the design and absorbancy is awesome BUT the velcro is not very sticky. My little guy had this diaper off in seconds. He awoke from his nap one day and pooped. He then took the diaper off and smeared it everywhere. I've never had him do this with any other velcro closures. The velcro comes apart as I put on his pants and when he crawls across the floor without pants on over it, it catches on our carpet and comes off of him. Again...I haven't had a problem with any other diapers that have velcro closures. Also, this diaper is definitely not a one size diaper. My little guy is 10 months and 25-30 pounds and this diaper was barely small enough. It still swallowed him up and there isn't a way to adjust the rise. All in all I am not impressed with the velcro though the version with snaps is a little better."
2,Attractive diaper but does not hold moisture well,"I bought a couple of these diapers after reading positive reviews on Amazon, and thinking that All-In-One is a better and more convinient option then cloth diapers with inserts. (We have twins, so dealing with inserts did not appeal to us :-))However, after trying it for a few times, I have to report that it does not hold moisture as well as Bum Genius diaper with inserts. This one looks attractive, and it is easy to put it on, but it does not hold moisture beyond 3 hours of wear (for 8-mth-old boys). That means we could not use it overnight, while Bum Genious diaper worked just fine overnight. Also, after just 3 hours, it was soaking wet inside and my boys had a bit of rash from it. It starts to leak on the sides too. There are more absorbent AIO diapers out there and at a lower price. This one is $20, and Bum Genius is $16. I have not tried the other ones, but this one does not seem to compete as well with Bum Genius."
3,Quality but lacks some convenience...,"I've been trying a few AIO cloth diapers on my 1 month old daughter, and this is trial diaper 3 of 3. I am happy with the quality of construction and materials. My only gripe is with the amount of snaps and the time it takes to figure out which one goes where to ensure a proper fit. I'm not an idiot; I just would prefer something easier. My very intelligent engineer husband (who thinks I'm crazy for wanting to cloth diaper in the first place...) is even less likely to want to figure out how to use them. I would recommend the Bum Genius AIO diaper over this one--they have the same quality (with a touch of velcro), but I think are easier to use. I hope this helps."
1,Disappointing to say the least,"I was very excited to run across this documentary on Amazon. I spent a good amount of time at the Twelve in the late seventies and early eighties. It was the best nightclub ever. This documentary did the Twelve no justice at all. Just a bunch of interviews with a handful of people, half of whom could not possibly have been old enough to go to the club when it was at its height--late seventies, very early eighties. I was hoping for pictures of the place, of people dancing and having a great time--anything to allow me to briefly relive one of the most enjoyable periods of my life--but all it was was a bunch of lame interviews and still photographs that went by so fast you couldn't recognize anyone. And, most startling of all: not a word about Dana Jacovidis, quite possibly the best DJ of all time. At least it mentioned Walter (once). I threw it away."
1,Racist Against the White Man,"This book is yet another attempt at degrading the white race. There is nothing wrong with being white, just like there is nothing wrong with being black. If you want to hear someones idea on whats wrong with being white instead of looking at the facts then you should read this book."
5,Very good historical account of religious communes.,"I think this is an excellent account of religious communes, spiritual collectives and intentional communities throughout the US during a hundred year period. Timothy Miller is a recognized authority on this subject and it is clearly evident in his book. Highly recommended."
1,difficult and tedious,"Although the two CDs cover a lot of material and the price is low, this course consists of nothing but vocabulary words and phrases to memorize, with no explanations of grammar or usage. For me at least, this has got to be one of the most difficult, boring and uninspiring ways to attempt to learn a language.This type of course might be useful if you were a tourist on a short visit to a country where no one spoke English and you only needed to memorize some survival phrases. But it's not so useful for Sweden."
1,Beware of this Sealer,"The first unit I purchased was a replacement for an older model. I had it for less than a year and it stopped working - i.e. it would vacuum out the air but never went to the sealing process. It was replaced by the company. Now, the second one is doing the same thing. I used to really love this company but now I will really hesitate to replace it. There is obviously a problem with this model but Tilla doesn't wish to recognize it. The customer service rep I spoke with was very curt and didn't even offer to have me send it somewhere for a fix. The comment was Sorry, it's out of warranty. That's all that was said. I am NOT pleased at all."
2,TOO MUCH INDUSTRY,"This is a disappointing album, especially if you compare it to other Coil releases. The sound is on the whole aggressively electronic, with brutally programmed drum machines, shouted vocals and a general mood of dislocation. Of course it is an industrial album, but it seems that the group are working against their own creative abilities. That said, there are two notable exceptions, which hint to Coil's subsequent musical development: the first is their cover of ""Tainted Love"", already a mega hit for Soft Cell, which is turned into a cathedral of imposing keyboards threatening to suffocate a dehydrated vocal from Jhonn Balance, and the other is ""The Tenderness Of Wolves"", a ghostly collaboration with Gavin Friday of Virgin Prunes fame. If you want to hear better Coil, look elsewhere."
3,"The magic of Promise, TX, but too many plotlines","Again, Debbie Macomber has come up with the delightful characters we grew to love in the Heart of Texas series. Unfortunately, Macomber tries to do too much of a good thing. This nearly 400 page book should have been two 200 page books. Macomber runs between 4 plotlines and has to cut back and forth between them all. In the end, each suffers. Each mini-plot does not get the time it needs to develop. In addition, Macomber spends too much time catching her readers up on her previous stories in a summary each time the major characters from those books are introduced. Macomber needs to let ""Promise"" stand on its own strengths and not lean on the first six books and let the characters in ""Promise"" develop with their own stories."
4,"Promise, Texas",Very enjoyable book. Annie came alive for me. Also enjoyed the other two underlying romances (The sheriff and the teacher; Nell and Gordon)
2,Looks ARE deceiving,"I bought this camera as a rush purchase to go on a weeked trip. Due the fact that my Kodak T550 was left at home. I know Aps cameras my not produce the greastest images blown up but I like them. I used my head and while I was there I took a test roll and got them developed at a local store in an hour. I was already uneasy with the half-way decent quality of the pictures then and by the time I went through 7 rolls of film I was really on edge. I got back home and over 60% of my pictures came out dull, underexposed, and just awful. So I took my negative to an additional two other film proccessors and some of my pictures came out better but not by much. I've only been taking pictures for 5 years and I don't claim to know it all, but I really have come to dislike this camera. The only 'strenghs' to the camera are its looks and the LCD glow-type button function. While it wasn't acting like a camera with astigmatism(which I have) the pictures came out great."
4,"Very good movie, based upon the life of a famous Chinese composer","I enjoyed seeing""Rhapsody of Spring,"" based upon the life of Shi Guangnan, a famous, modern Chinese composer. In the movie, the character Zhao Liming is Shi. Some of Shi's musical compositions are featured in the movie.The film at the beginning centers around the childhood of Zhao, a young girl who eventually becomes his wife and a close male friend, who also courted the young woman, who becomes Shi's wife. Zhao, initially, tries to help his best friend in his efforts to attract the young lady. However, she and Zhao are truly attracted to each other. Zhao as a young man is sent to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution. However, he returns from the countryside having learned more about certain folk songs from that region, which assist his development as a musician.My main quibble with the film is that the subtitles are occasionally hard to entirely read. Otherwise this is a very good and inspirational film."
3,"Good, but not 100% 'factual'","I really like the stories and the doctors, but when I learn about killers I want them to actually confess to doing them. That way I know that a innocent person isn't going to jail, and a couple of the doctors still claim innocence."
5,Respecting your Money and Yourself,"This book is a wonderful composition for young and old. I encourage you to read the book and encourage your children to read it too. It made me remember the enjoyment I had when I listened to my Grandparents tell me stories and speak to me about encouragement and good character. I wish there were more books and writings of this type available for young people and that books like these were a required reading material in school curriculums. The content is very honest,insightful and useful."
3,Classic Forgotten Songs,"The first volume of this collection is better known. I'd listen to these on cassette, while on long medical trips, such a smart move MOM!Volume two has few songs I'm sure in my 25 plus year life I have never heard.I must credit Disney for keeping these songs in familiar territory, without changing melody, yet adding sound effects to make a child more likely to be interested in.Into days society the simple idea of having down time, with family, is becoming more, and more a rarity. While there will forever be some sort of music [being played], from records to tapes, cds, and now MP3 there should by family togetherness!"
5,Withstands the test of time,"I first heard this album back when vinyl was in and cassettes were not yet popular. My mother had bought it for me and I played it over and over on my Fisher-Price record player. I was in love with it back then and still love it now. I pull it out every once in a while when I go to my parents house and feel like reminising. I recommended it to every one I know who has children and I plan on getting a copy myself when I have kids of my own (I might not even wait until then to get it). Some people might be disappointed because it doesn't actually have any of the Disney characters singing, but don't let that deter you from buying it. It's a great collection."
3,"Vol. 2 is good, but not the best.","I have owned all four volumes of the Disney Children's Favorite Songs since I was three years old, and although this one is enjoyable, I think it is probably the poorest of the four. The songs just aren't as much fun to listen to as on the others, and I recall that one of them, ""Old Blue,"" in particular, used to frighten me when I first got the tape because the singer sings that his dog died. Well, I'm over that fear now *muffles a sob* but I still don't think this tape is the best one to start off with. I'd advise buying all four volumes together, and if you only want to buy one, get Vol. 4. It's undoubtedly the best."
2,"Uninspired, needed more singers","Songs are pretty much what you expect, but i didn't like the singer. I was disappointed because it had the Disney logo and usually they are pretty good in the entertainment department. Albums for children I like to have a bunch of singers versus one person. You get sick of hearing the same voice for the entire tape. The singer was a little too ""twangy"" for me. He had too much of a country sound."
1,not the best lyrics,"I bought this CD for my two year old. Had I known that one of the songs refers to a drunken sailor who should be put away until he is sober, I would have purchased something else.I think Disney should be more careful of what they put on their CDs."
1,Reading the Rants of Unknown People,"This book is subtitled ""The History and Culture of Videogames,"" but it focuses on the latter, not the former. Granted, there are a lot of nice photographs of consoles and screenshots of games, but the bulk of the book consists of essays from little-known authors, freelance writers, and assorted educators who are (at most) nominally involved with the videogame industry. Some of their opinions are interesting, but most offer little in the way of entertainment or educational value.The book might have been fine as a companion to a museum show (which it apparently was), but as a stand-alone volume it is lacking. Even though there aren't very many books written on the subject of videogames, I can't recommend this one. Game Over, High Score, and The First Quarter are more educational, Supercade has more information and better pictures, and Arcade Fever is more entertaining."
3,Loved it until the end...,"OK, the bad first: The storyline is fairly believable until the ending, which I was utterly disappointed with. I also don't really feel that the men in the story are portrayed realistically. They are all weak and pathetic!But now the good: Despite these flaws, I really appreciate how masterfully and lovingly Ms. Binchy presents these characters through dialogue and their correspondence. What these characters don't say is as important as what they do say. I loved these resilient, strong women and I wish there was a sequel!"
3,Lovely Book,"The book was wonderful (except the ending) I felt like I was there with the O'Connor family as well as with Elizabeth and her family/friends. That said...the ending was such a disappointment because it didn't end, it just stopped. I felt like the author had written all she wanted to and just decided to stop."
1,Disappointing,"I've read other Maeve Binchy books (""Scarlet Feather"" and ""Evening Class"" were my favorites) and found them very enjoyable. This one started out good but gradually deteriorated. It just didn't have any direction and really fizzled out at the end. In my opinion it was really disappointing."
4,A cozy read,"This is perfect reading for those of you snowed in during the horrible snowstorms lately in the US. It's long and moves at a faster-paced than some of Binchy's other novels and satisfies your curiousity of characters that you want to know everything about!Elizabeth is sent to Ireland during WWII to keep safe during the Blitz in London. She spends five years there with Aisling O'Connor's family ~~ and returns back to London with a life-long best friend. This is their story of their friendship and all they've endured. Both have fallen in love and gotten married at different times of their lives, watch their mothers die and other growing-up situations that shape everyone's lives.It is a great story of friendship and touches somewhat on mother-daughter relationships as well ~~ and it's fast-paced so it's great to read during those long winter evenings. It is not my favorite Binchy but it's one of the best ones I've read.1-27-04"
4,Beautiful! Enthralling!,"Oh, I didn't want it to end! I was almost waiting for an epilogue. This was the first story I read by Maeve Binchy, and I must say: boy, have I been missing out! Some plot lines were a bit weak, and I would have liked a more elaborately told ending, but everything else in between was pure magic. The lives of the two girls (and eventually women) were so richly entertwined, and I loved every minute. I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a book that you can curl up next to the fire on a chilly night and wrap yourself in."
5,The book was very interesting and excellent!!,"This book was very interesting. It was the only book I have read by Binchy, but I plan on reading many more. I enjoyed it very much, and I hope you will to."
2,Binchy's talents not fully realized in debut novel,"As a long-time Binchy reader, I wanted to read her entire body of work. The final title uncovered turns out to have been her debut novel. Although the book offers the author's hallmark intriguing characters in believable situations, Binchy definitely did not hit her stride until after this initial effort. I am sincerely glad the publisher ascertained her potential for greater writing and gave the book a green light since every successive story has been utterly compelling. And that includes her latest, and purportedly final novel, Scarlet Feather."
1,Binchy's worst,Love Maeve! But this book goes into a downward spiral. The early part of the book was great until Elizabeth turned into such a nitwit; thank God Aisling held it afloat.
1,A Disappointed Fan,"I enjoy Maeve Binchy's books; her style, wit and warmth usually dazzle me, but I felt the ending to LAPC (the entire last quarter of the book) was not in sync with the rest of the book. And if the ending does not satisfy the journey, why should I read it again?"
2,Very Disappointing,"Every character in this book was constantly unhappy and never seemed to find true happiness at all. (Sure,that could be part of the story) But overall, I found it slightly depressing and unrealistic. Some parts were dry and uneventful and near the end Maeve Binchy seems to have wanted to end it way too quickly. I know that writers shouldn't hang onto the ending for too long, but it was at the climax and then stopped within a few paragraphs."
3,my review,"This is the story of two girls from different backgrounds, characters, cultures and looks, who become friends and remain the same even after they suffer different life shattering events. No husbands, or family members or work are able to separate them.This is a great book of friendship. Very well written and the characters are very well defines and presented."
3,Very disappointed,"I have read all of Maeve Binchy's books, and this is the first one I felt disappointed with. There were parts I enjoyed, then each time the story looked like it would turn around for the characters, it always turned out sad, I found it depressing. I would not recommend anyone to read this book, especially if you were feeling down."
4,Always a Good Read,Bought this as a gift for someone but absolutely loved it when I read it years ago. Maeve never disappoints.
4,Worthwhile reading,"Touching story. Sad in some ways, but seemed authenic. How many of us knows any history of Ireland during the war years?"
3,"A disappointing end (don't worry, I won't tell)","As a big fan of Maeve Binchy's cozy, inviting stories that never stint on human emotion and yet always manage to keep their ""homey"" quality, I found LIGHT A PENNY CANDLE to be another good example of her work. It deals with choices, compromises, torn relationships, and family strife, but it's also a story about the incredible power of friendship. Right up until the end, it was a good read. The end itself, though, is disappointing. I won't give anything away, but don't expect Binchy's signature ""I want more"" ending. She usually leaves her characters without total closure, but THIS ending is something else. I had to knock the book down a star for it."
2,Unrealistic and disappointing,"My first Binchy novel was Evening Class -- what a treat -- her characters were fascinating and their idiosyncracies were endearing.My second Binchy novel was Light a Penny Candle, and boy was I disappointed. I agree with the other reviews that this book did not properly develop the two main characters (especially in the childhood years) and the ending was absolutely puzzling. A botched, rushed, and worst of all, inconsistent ending.I'm hoping that someone out there can recommend a Binchy novel that is of comparable caliber to Evening Class. I don't think I could take another frustrating read like Light A Penny Candle."
3,Disappointing,"As my first Binchy book, this was recommended to me as the best and I was disappointed. I did like the first half better than the second. By the end of the book the girls were so selfish and self-involved. If one more character told Elizabeth how magnificent she was I was ready to stop reading. And how easily they let Johnny use them both. How about a little self respect, girls. And how convenient for them that their husbands ended up as they did (I don't want to spoil the plot for others by saying what did happen to them). Sorry, but I don't understand the appeal of these two characters."
3,Quick Read,Light a Penny Candle was an ok summer read. A friend likes this author and thought I would give it a try. Nothing to get too excited about.
4,My sister's favorit,"This was my sister's favorite book, so I decided to re-read it since she and Ms. Binchy both died in August. I know I read it a long time ago, but I didn't remember much about it. I did enjoy the friendship and the story kept me interested and was very fast paced. A lovely story about the cards we're dealt, which are not always good ones, and the choices we make as a result of those cards. Through it all, friendship is the one thing that survived all the bumps in the road. Two girls thrown together because of a war end up closer than sisters. We should all have friends like that."
4,Review: Light a Penny Candle,"Elizabeth and Aisling were childhood friends. Where Aisling was bold, Elizabeth was enclosed in a proper shell. Later, Aisling's support brought her Elizabeth through the painful end of her parents' chilly marriage. In return, Elizabeth's friendship helped Aisling endure her own unsatisfying marriage to a raging alcoholic. This is a story of two girls growing up, drifting apart, and coming back together.. It takes us from their childhood to their early thirties. Aisling and Elizabeth in Light a Penny Candle make you proud as they struggle to defeat the odds. It is hard to describe this incredible book because they go through so many stages, but you find yourself right there with them every step of the way."
4,Story of a friendship,"This book was practically my first by Binchy. I'd read Tara Road as a part of the Oprah book club several years back, and I'd always wanted to read more. Well, I finally got around to it and was satisfied.The story starts out with two girls, ages 10. Their mothers were friends when they were little, but now with one family in Ireland and the other in London, they aren't as close anymore. That is, until the war forces one mother to ask if her daughter can live in Ireland until the war is over. That's where the friendship of the two little girls begins. The novel spans approximately the next 20 years of their lives. The ups and downs.I enjoyed the book, I suppose mostly because of the fascenation I had with the friendship the two girls shared. Binchy also throws in twists and turns along the way that keep you interested to know what will happen next. Great book!"
3,Not my favorite Binchy,"I would agree with previous reviews that this is not my favorite Binchy. It was compelling and interesting for the better part of the book, but seemingly fell apart at the end. I was disappointed in the depressing end. I would really recommend Scarlett Feather, Evening Class and Quentin's for a reader just starting to read Binchy. They are compelling and filled with interesting characters."
3,"Binchy, a fantastic author who didn't know how to end this book!","I really liked this book until the very end. Binchy writes clearly and simply and each of her characters is not only well defined but lovable. I lived through the time of which she writes and was empathetic of her tales of wartime chaos and deprivation. Her plot was completely believable and I was anxious to see how the story evolved -- but it didn't. At the end, I was looking forward to the time when Aisling and Elizabeth, free of matrimonial encumbrances, would finally settle down with each other in Ireland. But they walked out of the courthouse and into oblivion without a by-your-leave. Very disappointing. It spoiled the whole book. It would have taken very few paragraphs to write a satisfying epilogue. Pity."
4,Excellent except then end...,"Loved it, so gripping but the end was a bit of the let down. I enjoyed it from the first word."
3,very disappointing ending,"I don't often review books on Amazon, but after finishing this book, I wanted to see what other readers thought about it. I've read most of Binchy's works, and have loved every one of them. I even loved this one -- until the very end. What a melodramatic, ""grade B movie"" ending! The ending was very much out-of-character for both the main characters, as well as for Binchy herself. The lack of resolution and closure goes beyond what one would anticipate; this one needed a few more pages to deal with some of the issues."
4,Does the job,"It does what I need it to do. Fits a little loose around the seat post, but still works fine. No danger of the bike falling off or anything."
4,Great book! Very Uplifting,"I was impressed by this book. I love how it starts with a verse and then has a short uplifing story. I read the book on the train each morning and it puts me in a great frame of mind for the rest of the day! If you like Chicken Soup for the Soul, you will like this book."
3,Careful of the ending,"Wonderful introduction to Korean folklore, with gorgeous illustrations. The story is about two frog children who do the opposite of what their mom asks. At the end (cover your eyes if you don't like the ending given away), the froggie boys learn their lesson when their mom dies. I actually change the ending when reading it to young children, but it could be a nice book for talking to kids about doing what they're told. It is also a pourquoi story, also known as an origin story, which gives an explanation for why frogs croak when it rains."
1,how do you get to 8 pieces?,"I don't own this and didn't buy this. But I am very interested in why this is an EIGHT piece set.1 teapot total 11 creamer total 21 sugar bowl total 32 cups total 52 saucers total 7if you count the lid of the sugar bowl as a single item, you get 8 items, but then, you would have to count the teapot lid as a separate item, as well, which gives you 9. Am I wrong? Am I missing something?"
2,Good Sound Except for Obnoxious Bass,"These speakers sound pretty good, but the bass is obnoxious and overpowering. You can adjust the bass level on the subwoofer, but you have to turn it all the way down to eliminate the distorted thumping and then it just sound muffled. If you like listening to music the way it was meant to sound don't buy these speakers."
5,Outstanding!,"These speakers are amazing! The sound quality is great. I use them while gaming, or whenever I feel like waking the neighbors up with some stuff I call music...lol. For the price, you can't beat the quality. Good job Logitech!"
3,Not bad for the price,"For the money, these are not bad speakers. They miss out on some of the mid-range tones, but cover the high and low end pretty well. My other set of computer speakers (which cost $200) get a much fuller sound, but if you are looking for decent sound on the cheap, these are the way to go."
4,"Excellent price and value, but lacking a bit soundwise.","For the price, this speaker system is a very good deal. Detail is OK with music, but there are better choices for a few more bucks for those more serious listeners that are looking for a bit more detail and timbral accuracy (such as the Altec-Lansing VS2321, for example). For some reason, some instruments and vocals don't sound that realistic or natural, and at times seem 'hollow' and 'strained' compared to better PC speakers systems i've auditioned. That said, where else can you find a brand-name 2.1 speaker system WITH a subwoofer for about thirty bucks?"
5,Phenomenal sound for the price,"This is an amazing deal.. The three way system sounds better than any speakers i heard in this price range.Pros: very affordable, great highs, rambling lows, volume control and headphone jack on the speakerCons: sub-woofer has a lot of power and sometimes gives too much bass."
3,Mediocre but good for the price,"Personally I think these speakers were a good buy for the money but I wish I would have spent a little more on a better 2.1 system. The sound on these speakers is good but midrange is seirously lacking. The two satellites sound kind of ""tin can""ish but generally they are pretty good. The subwoofer is definetly the most powerful piece of equipment of it all but it really overwhelms the sound, so i set it to the minimum volume level. The subwoofer also has very poor range and isnt capable of making anything but thumps in comparison to higher quality 2.1 systems. For the price though, this is probably the best sound system you could get anywhere if you are a bass lover. If you are not there are better 2.0 systems out there with better sound, but not as much bass and power as these. I am sick of the bass though after about a year and I will be moving up to a higher quality 2.0 system in hopes of a better midrange sound."
3,Nice little entry system speaker system,"I bought the Z4 for the house, and this one for the office. It's better than your run of the mill speaker systems that come with computer systems. It has a nice bass, not as clean and loud as the Z4, but these are not Z4s either.Not the best for music, but for general purpose office work, games, and occasional CDs, it's fine. And for the price, you can't go wrong."
4,Very good!,"These are very good speakers. I love them, people comment on how much sound comes out of these little speakers. The sound is really rich too. I have them hooked up to my computer most of them time but sometimes I plug them right into my mp3 player and the sound is wonderful! I am now a fan of this brand."
4,Great Sound At Bargain Price,"Forty years ago, speakers that got voices ""right"", so that it seemed you were at a live concert, not listening to a recording, cost $500 a pair, and up. Ten years ago, the price for first rate speakers dropped to as little as $200 per pair. The X-230 speakers get voices ""right"", for $50.Yes, the mid-bass is too heavy, and there is no DEEP bass. But, these are tiny speakers, designed to be plugged into a laptop computer in a dorm room, not fill a large family room with floor shaking bass.I use them with my phone, which has a good EQ app that lets me smooth out the mid-range and upper bass. In an average size bedroom, Cleo Laine sounds like Cleo Laine...$50 speakers connected to a $99 phone.After two years or so, they still are as good as new, even though I sometimes push the volume up past sensible.As of November 2012, the X-230 are not available ""new"". Sigh."
5,Fantasic Service #1 Product for Price,"The service and speed of delivery was number one. Product received in excellent condition. The Logitech x-230 2.1 speaker system is excellent. You would be very surprised to hear the sound that is generated from such a compact and inexpensive system. It weighs about total about 4 to 5lbs. Well made the sub-woofer has weight and is not cheaply put together. The sound is fantastic. I use this system for my T-mobile HTC One s, when I'm traveling or going to a deck section with my partners. It is the right size and the bass and the satellite speakers produce clean highs and midrange. The Sub-woofer will surprise you with its deep clean bass even when driven. Remember garbage in garbage out. The tracks of your music must be clean in the first place to get get sound reproduction out. Very Satisfied with this purchase. Thank-you. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE WHILE THEY LAST!!!!!!Carter M. Roberts"
3,"Good, but not best","fist off, i am an audiophile. and the sub woofer plays mids.. more so than i would like. and it gets vary hard to listen to at times. but if you listen to rap, hip hop and what not they are great, has a vary tight bass. and it can get vary loud, i have has this system for about 2-3 years and its still going strong. the highs are nice ans crisp. and i really like that you can have them on the wall.. they are on my desk now because i moved. for the average user they are great speakers"
4,Fantastic speakers!,"What a price! Got the amazon deal, got these for 20 bucks. What a deal!! Sounds absolutely fantastic. A bit too many cables on the speakers, but its behind my desk so it doesn't really matter. Additionally, i havent found the use of the major speaker, other than base... can someone explain that?REally a great buy, totally recommend it."
2,"Sounds good, looks not so goo","This set sounds good, but it's not put together very well. The wire casing going into one of the speakers is not connected to the speaker which results in a few exposed wires. I have a feeling that this will get worse after time and eventually the wires will get pulled loose, especially because I have them hooked up to a laptop. Go with a comparable pair from Altec Lansing instead. I have an older (more than 7 years) set of speakers (with subwoofer) from Altec with which I'm extremely happy."
1,Right Speaker NOT WORKING!!!,"I got these speakers because my old HP ones were petered out after 5 years so I thought I would use a gift certificate I got for Amazon. I did not get a used pair, I bought what I thought was brand-new.I even had a friend say that Logitech was a good maker for speakers so that's what motivated me to get these.I just hooked them up and the right speaker has absolutely NO SOUND! Im so pissed because I have NEVER gotten anything on Amazon before and got a crappy product. I loathe the idea of spending shipping on return items... what a waste. i better get my money back.Oh and the Bass is WAY too much!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!"
2,"if you to use headphones with this, be warned","For it's price the sound may be descent, but if you want to use headphones for private listening, be advised you are in for a surprise. Turns out, when you plug in the headphones the only sound you get is what comes through your soundcard, and you cannot adjust the volume with the volume control on the speakers. Further, you can only control the volume using your operating systems volume control. So, if your sound card only gives a low volume sound even with it's volume control turned up full that is all the sound you will get, making these speakers useless and a waste of money. I mean, since all I get when I use headphones is the low volume that comes straight from the soundcard, why do I need these speakers? I could have just plugged my headphones straight into my soundcard and saved my money. Kind of interesting that for a company called ""Logitech"", they didn't put much ""logic"" into this headphone design."
1,I never recieved this item and I think you know this.,There is no tel number or e-mail adress where I can contact you so in a month you finally wrote me.Now please tell me how are we going to solve this problem.I'm really dissapointed...
2,Too much bass,"Although I considered the dual driver and subwoofer speakers, independently speaking, very good, particularly so for the price. unfortunately, I can't say the same for the set as a whole. I thought the tonal balance between the two to be quite poor. A little bit more mid-range sound might have helped, but the subwoofer produces FAR too much ""bassy"" bass. I tried turning the volume on the subwoofer all the way down, separating it from the dual drivers as much as the speaker cables allowed, even rotating the subwoofer away from the normal frontal direction, I still considered the problem rather pronounced. It's too bad, as I expected much better. Particularly so, after reading the (in general) great reviews that it got."
5,A Good Buy,"good sound quality, easy to install. got one set for my 7-year old's pc. i'll get a second one for my pre-schooler when he's ready to have his very own computer."
2,painfully overdone bass,"I did not have high expectations for these speakers, but I thought they would deliver decent sound for the money. I should have read the negative reviews! On the plus side, the speakers sound okay in the mid-upper range (though mid is a little lacking). Also, distortion is not an issue at reasonable volumes.But the bass is ridiculous. It's muddy, and what it lacks in clarity it makes up in volume. Way too much volume. Even at the lowest setting, the bass dominates the music. I've managed to corral it for the most part using an equalizer, but then I have to switch presets every time I listen to music with headphones.I don't hate bass. I have a Hsu VTF-2 subwoofer for my home theater and it rocks the house. But it also knows its place. The sub on the Logitech doesn't.I would give this product one star if it wasn't so easy to use an equalizer. The sound out of the box is simply unacceptable."
2,Received defective,"I normally like the quality of Logitech products, but was disappointed when these speakers arrived defective. The ""tube"" inside the woofer unit had fallen off and rattles around inside the enclosure. The enclosure is glued shut, so I can't open it to fix the problem. I didn't need to use these speakers until nearly two months after I received them, and just opened the box today. It's too late to return them.For the price paid, the speakers would sound good if the woofer didn't have the rattle from the loose part."
5,love these things,"I listen to my iPod at work, and needed some simple, inexpensive speakers. These had good reviews so I picked them up. Wow!!! They just sound so crisp, and the subwoofer adds a nice low end. I'm overall surprised that these sound this good for the price. I would recommend something like this for your iPod or computer, over some of the more expensive iPod speaker systems. Others at my office have purchased these too since they heard them"
4,Logitech Speakers,"I am an avid user of Amazon.com and when I needed new speakers for my desktop I looked there. I am very pleased with the product, both for the price I paid and the quality of the speakers. Installation was extremely simple. The sound quality is great and I like the bass control on the subwoofer as well as the volume control on the satellite speaker. This was the perfect purchase for its price and performance provided."
5,Best Speakers!,These Speakers are AMAZING and i highly recommend them to anyone who wants new speakers.
5,Awesome sound,"I purchased a refurbished set of these speakers and they sound awesome. I stayed up all night listening to music and the speakers made it easy to hear every single sound cymbals,drums, etc...can be heard clearly. However, if you try to push it too far the highs can get a little hint of distortion, but for $29.99 I can not complain. I would definitely recommend these speakers. P.S. I did listen to some Altec Lansing and some Klipsch speakers and actually these sound better."
4,Too Good For Price,Its great value for money. The sound quality is excellent and I would definitely recommend it to anybody interested. My only regret is not going with the 5.1 system.
4,Its good for what it is,"I got this set to replace my Altecs which i had for over 5yrs. It sounds pretty good, its clear and the bass is really really nice. Another plus is that it looks pretty sleek...the black finish goes well with my PC setup or tv...its excellent for gaming!!They're two things which i notice one of which is not really a fault per say..but i seem to have to turn it up to about 75%+ with subs as 50% to get a real kick (its has independent bass/volume control)..the sound is still solid no baffling, and the bass breather works to eliminate bad sounds.The only other issue is the placement of the bass volume control...its located to the back of the box, which can be an annoyance based on where its placed...other than that its a pretty good buy."
4,"a lot of bass, but not neccessarily bad","I bought an HDTV about a month ago, and being the broke guy that I am, I ended up getting a somewhat less expensive model. The picture is great, but the sound from the internal speakers is really thin. So, rather than dumping even more money into a set of 5.1 speakers and a receiver, I went with a set of stereo speakers that I could just plug into the headphone jack on my TV, which is where these come in. For movies and Xbox 360 games like Gears and Halo 3, they're great. Personally, I prefer the extra bass for that stuff. It really emphasizes the thuds/explosions/etc in what I watch and play. I do listen to music through my 360 occasionally, and yes, the bass is a little much in my opinion for that, but I love it for everything else. I would recommend them if you're using them for inexpensive theater/gaming type speakers, but the bass might turn some people off if you're looking specifically for some new music speakers."
2,Just an average product.,"My biggest problem with the Logitech x-230: You can't totally turn off the subwoofer. At the subwoofer's lowest level, you get WAY too much bass. For any normal adult (say, thirty years or older) THAT is a reason to DISLIKE these speakers. Since I'm over thirty years old, I DISLIKED these speakers: However I gave them to my teenage son, and he seems to like them: See what I mean?"
2,Average speakers for the price,"For the price these speakers are decent, but if you are at all particular about the music and sound you listen to, you may not be happy with these. I am constantly adjusting the EQ of the output for each song. The range of the bass is very small--mainly just a boom--not much variance in tone so it tends to overtake the song. I had a hunch that buying the logitech brand for anything else than a mouse would be a mistake, and I think that's what I did. Spend a little more if you can."
4,Keepers,"I tried several sets trying to find a set that did not have the ""tinny"" high frequency sound heard with most low cost speakers. The Logitech Z-3 set was unsatisfactory in this area though they had more bass and power (and looks). I'll keep theX-230 set."
2,disapointed,"piece of junk, dang things made in china and it shows it. Had mutliple scratches and the stand to one of the speakers was completely busted off. The sound quality is decent but nothing worth getting too excited over. Would recommend a diffrent brand or just spending the extra bucks and go with a better model."
3,disappointed,I bought these looking for something good but inexpensive.I had recently purchased a set of similar speakers from Walmart and took them back.These Logitech speakers deliver good bass but the volume is by far way to low even turned all the way up.I would have rather spent $30-$50 more and got some better ones.Hope this helps...
2,No midrange... all bass,I bought these because the price was great but I was disappointed. There is definitely too much bass and not much else. The sound is all highs and lows. Adjusting the graphic equalizer on the player(software) can't completely fix it. I bought the Creative T3000s to compare and they are noticeably better. I returned the Logitechs.
4,Good stuff.,"I bought these for my office computer. They sound great, particularly for that price. My only complaint (if you can even call it that) is that they photos don't really make it clear how large they are. They aren't huge, but had I seen them in person first I may have passed for something a little less conspicuous."
4,"Great Sound, weird Smell?","The speakers and subwooofer are great and perform a bit better than expected for me, 2.1 is good enough for most people, its a very good price too. 5 speakers and a subwoofer is only necessary for home theaters, and the price to value ratio is as much as what u get here.About the smell, my subwoofer gives off this weir plastic smell. I thought it wouldnt be a big deal but i get nausiated by it, hopefully the smell will be gone after a few months, perhaps this smell only affects me in particular or just happened be on my subwoofer. Nonetheless they are great speakers"
4,Power Packed little speakers,Love the speakers. Great sound for a great price. The small package with subwoofer can really pack a punch! You can really hear the clarity in the ranges of the music. Highly recommend for the price. You just can't beat it!
5,Great set of speakers for the price,These are a great set of speakers for the price. Fine sound. there is a knob on the woofer to adjust the bass. These things look really cool too. IMOP you can't go wrong with these for the price.
5,Good inexpensive speakers,They have been great. Glad I bought them for my work computer. Adds some music to those long hours.
4,Fabulous sound,Awesome sound . sounds like a home stereoThe only drawback is the hardwired speaker wires are TOO SHORT! so its not possible to seperate the left and right speakers more than a few feet. stupid design
5,give those speakers a chance,"Talk about great speakers! You couldn't ask for better speakers if you tried. Everything you've ever wanted in a perfect sound can be found with these Dual Drive Speakers. You will notice just how FULL and wonderful the sound really is. Not all speakers deliver total satisfaction. I'm proud to say these ones do. If you want speakers that give you the best possible sound, you found the right ones."
4,"Bass is full, but the higher ranges are tinny","As a lot of other reviewers have mentioned, the bass has a nice full sound, and that is definitely one of the best qualities of this speaker. However, if you have music that goes in the higher ranges, there is a tinny quality that lacks the fullness of the bass. There's also a tendency for distortion at higher frequencies, even when the volume is not very loud. Don't play choral music on these speakers."
5,"Great base, maybe too good","The system has great sound quality. For the price, no other system beats this great Logitech product. The satellites look great, and the sound is clean. The subwoofer delivers a strong performance, and generates powerful bass sounds, maybe a little too powerful."
5,The best speakers for this or any other price,"I just got these speakers and I am blown away every time I turn them on. The sound is amazingly clear at any volume, and with an adjustable bass, you can listen at whatever setting you enjoy. Works amazing with computers or cd-players, a must-buy if you are looking for speakers."
4,very pleased!,The speakers are very nice even though the cost is low. The sub is amazing for its size and cost. Definitely a good buy!
5,omfg,"best quality ever... best bass ever... buy these, you wont regret it. bass is boomin, and the mid+ is crystal clear. comes with an adapter to hookup with Xbox (r) and PS2 (r). worx great. just save urself time and buy these now"
3,Weird Controls,"An excellent speaker system, however the power button is placed to make it difficult to turn off (if one pushes the button, the speaker slides backwards) and the subwoofer control is on the subwoofer itself, which means if u want to change it, you have to crawl under the desk and find the dial on the side. Still, as speaker/subwoofer the fidelity is great & plays well."
4,Logi-cal choice,"I can rock with these units. My wife tells me to close the PC room door, and then to turn them down. At $35, what a steal. Great crystal clear high end and powerful bass. The mids somewhat fall out, but the hi-lo blend compensates. ""Logi"" rocks."
4,A little bassy,These speakers sound far better than my old Altec Lansing ADA-305's and I much prefer these controls with the exception of the sub woofer control which was on one of the satellites on the Altecs. The one serious complaint I have is that the sub woofer can over-ride the rest of the music. I took off only one star because it can be tamed by turning it all the way down and adjusting your equalizer settings. Just adjust the 100Hz range.
4,"Love the speakers, not the subwoofer.",Speakers are great and the whole system sounds good but the subwoofer needs a switch to disable it sometimes. Even on the lowest setting it still pumps out the bass. Will probably splice a switch in or something.
4,Good speakers,This speaker system delivers great sound and good clarity for a PC system. The one minor negative is a fiber mesh grill cover that could be torn easily.
4,Right Price Right Equipment,It doesn't get much better than these speakers. Yea if you crank the volume up to the max u can hear a little bit of static but otherwise they are fantastic especially for the price. The bass is very powerful and the speakers are mountable which ends up looking pretty nice on my desk. Best Buy sells these things for like $70 so not to do Amazon a publicity stunt but they had the lowest price when i was shopping.
4,Bang for the buck,"Considering the price, I'm very pleased with these speakers.They're hooked up to my PC and are most often used when I'm viewing TV (via my Hauppage TV card). The adjustable bass volume knob makes all the difference. I've got it turned almost all the way down and I find the sound quality very acceptable."
5,WOW!,"All I can say is WOW! These speakers will blow you away with their fidelity and power. They rival my home Bose system, which cost an arm and a leg.Mine arrived in perfect condition and have pleased me very much with their theater-like sound.Highly recommended. Unbelievable price."
5,I'm happy with my purchase!,"After reading quite a number of reviews here I decided to risk my money, and I am not disappointed. Great sound, great value."
4,Pretty Good!!!!!!!!!!,"Before I bought these speakers, I was listening to music from my laptop speakers and it sounded like crap!!!!! But then I got the logitech and my dorm is bumpin now. The R.A's always bother me about how loud the music is....everyone in the building can feel the bass once on max. Very good speakers i love them!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Good and bad,Good: Very nice appearance and great sound quality for the price. Bad: In my haste to set up my new speakers I cut my hand on the cardboard box lid. LOL
5,GREAT SPEAKERS,THESE SPEAKERS WHERE WELL PACKAGED ON ARRIVAL. VERY EASY TO INSTALL. THEY SOUND GREAT. I READ SOME NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THE SUB WOOFER BUT I HAVEN'T FOUND A PROBLEM. I LIKE THE DEEP BASE SOUND.
4,Great PC Speakers!,I have built several multimedia PC systems and these speakers were the best bang for the buck I have ever spent for speakers. Great sound with good base control.
5,Terrific compilation of 60s Texas psychedelia and more,"A superb collection, originally issued as a 2-LP set, that collects rarities from the vaults of Texas' International Artists label. In addition to previously unreleased and demo sides from Texas psychedlia stalwarts such as Red Krayola and 13th Floor Elevators (including incredible pre-Elevators tracks from Roky Erikson and the Spades), there are many fine cuts by obscure garage punk acts such as The Chapparrals, and a terrific cover of the Bee Gees ""In My Own Time"" by Patterns. The Red Krayola demos (many of which would be re-recorded for their debut) are a treat. Side 3 (on the original vinyl) is perhaps the only downer, as the blues tracks from Big Walter, Lightnin' Hopkins and Dave Allen aren't particularly exceptional. The radio commercial for the Elevators' ""Bull of the Woods"" is a hoot, as is Roky's spaced out late-70s interview on San Francisco's KSAN-FM."
4,Funny,"Funny and practical sayings inside, however the enunciation cues are not as helpful as I need for such a guttural language."
4,A Handy Guide for the Basics,"This is a small, handy guide for basic phrases a traveler might need. Phrases are given phonetically as well -- a help to asking questions even if you can't understand the answers!"
4,The Art of a Working Barn,"Wonderful oversize book came quickly and arrived in good condition. Very few New England barns hence 4 stars. One architectural note of interest was the various illustrations of framing details, including an example of how one barn was erected by hand."
2,Kind of disappointed,"I bought these for a gift and was surprised to find them much smaller than I expected. Plus, the links were pretty shabily made (you can see the seam and the links aren't smooth -- they almost look coated). I was pretty disappointed. I've bought several other things from SilverSpeck which were much nicer and much better made, for a lot less money. Alas, I'm returning these. On a plus note - when I called SilverSpeck to return them (even tho more than 30 days had passed) - the guy was very helpful and just told me to send in the exchange info. Kudos on the customer service!"
3,"It has aged but, not too well",If you are interested in the history of wine it is a fine and interesting book. It was published in 1989 and the wine world has changed it needs to be revised. It does a poor job on wines of the new world; still it is a book worth reading.
4,Good CD,"Purchased for my husband who is getting his master's in music (horn performance.) He wanted to use one of the solos on his graduate recital, but hasn't been able to find a copy of it in print anywhere. Has some unique literature that you don't hear on most horn CDs."
4,Short Stories That are Truly Symbolic,"This collection of short stories featuring the loveable Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot are quite delightful. The stories are written in true ""tongue-in-cheek"" Agatha Christie fastion. In this book we see Hercule Poirot taking on 12 very distinct cases before he thinks he will retire. He tries to duplicate the historical ""Labours of Hercules"" with these ""final"" little cases. Each story is truly unique and written in the classical Christie style. There are broad references in these stories to the what is written in the classics about the original ""Labours of Hercules"", and each story is a gem in its own right."
4,Reading with Tequila,"I love short stories by Agatha Christie. While I enjoy her full length books, she tended to be pretty loose with Poirot's Belgian language which is confusing to this ignorant American. It's French, right? The short stories give me all the mystery I crave without trying to decipher what phrases such as a bientot and depechez vous mean. Most of the stories were entertaining, but a few you could really tell the outcome a well before the story ended."
5,Peroit,"It's Hercule Poirot! Need I say anything more? Any of Christie's books featuring Poirot are worth owning, reading, and rereading."
4,A fun read.,"As a novice to the mystery genre, I very much liked this book. Although there is an attempt to form a continuing thread throughout the chapters of this book, it is really just 12 little mysteries with their own characters (with Poirot being the only real common character), plots, and suspense.As a result, avid mystery readers might be put off by the lack of detail and story in each storylet. However, each one is rather compelling in its own right (although some are certainly better than others). Thus, the reader doesn't have to put much of an investment in any of them; soon after the situation is presented, the resolution appears.I'd recommend this book to those who haven't read many mysteries and are curious to see what they're about."
4,PRETTY GOOD...,"Although I would not say that this is her best work, Christie does some clever and unexpected plot twists. The labors are divided up by chapters, each labor being almost its own short story, joined with the others by the subject of the novel. There are some labors that are better than others, but over all, it's a pretty good read."
1,Poor short stories,It's incredible how she insisted on making this kind of books. They don't even may be called a book. When it starts to call your attention the story finishes. You don't get even to define more or less the characters'psychological profile at the end. I don't recommend it.
4,Feels So Good...,"Jamiroquais back...and it feels so good! This party happy album sets the tone off just right. It starts off with the undoubtedly dance friendly ""Feels So Good"" , then breaks into ""Little L"" and keeps the momentum going with ""You Give Me Someting"". The party mood is broken a bit, when the album goes into the highly dramatic ""Corner of the Earth"", It's not a party jam, but it's definitely a beautifully serene song. Well J-Kay, picks it up lovely for partiers after that! ""Love Foolosophy"" picks up right where ""You Give Me Something"" left off. The only complaint I have is this album is tooo short! It leaves fans feenin' for more. Ultimately. Jamiroquai is back, and it feels so good..."
4,music that makes you feel good,"Jamiroquai is back with a new album, called A FUNK ODYSSEY. There are 10 tracks, with a bonus hidden track. The album is a nice collection of songs, that fans will be sure to love. It may not be as good as say TRAVELLING WITHOUT MOVING, but why compare to a masterpiece album? A FUNK ODYSSEY adds new elements to their music, without trying to be like any of their other albums. The album in many songs has a disco feel to them, slightly, with the same vibe we get from Jamiroquai's songs. Highlights from the album include Picture of my Life, Little L, Black Crow and Feel so Good. I highly reccomend you try this album, its a nice surprise!"
3,Not the best,"OK, I bought this album as soon as it came out, jiving a long to 'Little L', was the best part about it, but thats really the only really good part about it. This album lacks the edge that their first albums had, the density seen in Return of The Space Cowboy is not seen in A Funk Oddysey. There are some good tracks through the album, but it lacks the intensity that is seen in Jays other work. A funk Oddysey shows so much commercialisation in it, made more for the 'teenie boppers' of society, and not the true disco fans that Jamiroquai have recently catered for. I think that is a real shame, because the first albums showed so much promise, so much flare, but A Funk Oddysey hasn't really continued in the true Jamiroquai tradition.If you liked the first albums, then you shouldn't really bother with A Funk Oddysey, you may feel the disapointment that i have about it."
5,Great CD,This band is fantastic. They have really turned a whole generation on to the funk and groove sounds along with Brand new Heavies. This cd just continues where they left off. Funky and Soulful. This cd is a funk must have...
3,It's alright...,"Having followed Jamiroquai since they started out, I can honestly say the cd is so so. They haven't really grown artistically and there are no real catchy songs except for maybe Little L. I was expecting a lot more from them but after their success with Traveling Without Moving, I am not suprised. I'm glad I bought this cd because I do love their music, but it's not THAT fabulous. I hope it grows on me. I think die-hard Jamiroquai fans will appreciate it but not love it."
5,Brilliant record!,I enjoy this record even though its different style from their first 2-3 records but its still refreshing and a great funk record. Cornet of the Earth & Picture of my life proof Jamiroquai could also wrote a cool bossa tune
3,True to the 70's,"Jamiroquai is one of the few bands that doesn't deviate from tried-and-true 70's disco pop/funk. If you like them, you'll like these 70's bands which popularized the sound: T-Connection, Shalamar, Ripple, Heatwave/Rod Temperton (wrote some of M. Jackson's greatest hits, all 112 bpm), Chic, Brainstorm (a first rate band - listen to ""Don't Let Me Catch You With Your Groove Down""), Fat Larry's Band (a great band, but sadly Larry is RIP) and the incredible Crown Heights Affair. If you want harder funk, you'll have to try B.T. Express, Kool & The Gang, the Kay Gees, Kleer, J.B., Manu Dibango, Wee Willie & The Winners, yadda yadda..."
3,electronics zapped my favorite band,"Well to start off I would definitely recommend any of the other cds by Jamiroquai over this one. I got into Jamiroquai because they mixed Jazz with so many different things and defied classification. With this album the swerved away from the heart of jazz and put down their instruments for digital processors. I don't agree that Jay lost his touch with the album though. If you haven't listened to any Jamiroquai I would recommend ""Return of the Space Cowboy"" and if you get hooked on them like i did come back to this one to salvage some pretty kewl tracks on it."
2,What happened?,"Ok, heres the deal. I love Jamiroquai but this album was a complete letdown. Yes, it is dancy but thats not why I loved Jamiroquai before. They were about the groove, soul, and the freedom of music. Now all that has been replaced by machines. Where's the didjeridoo? Wheres Stuart Zenders funky bass? To the person that stated that Jamiroquai is Jay Kay...that is completely incorrect...at least it was a few years ago. Now, without the help of an awesome backing band, Jay Kay is nothing but a ... Stuart was smart to leave when he did."
4,Get down with Jamiroquai.,"Hook-infested album that has a heavier influence on 1970's disco than his previous efforts. If a cut like ""Little L,"" can't make you dance, then chances are you're comatose. Jay-Kay doesn't depart from his usual formula (1970's soul/funk grooves, the Stevie Wonder influence), but then again, consistency has always been his greatest strength. Only the dull ballads weigh the album down and keep it from greatness. Otherwise, this one's a keeper."
4,Phonk 4 Life!,"I was hesitant to buy this CD after I read several of the reviews on Amazon.com. Nonetheless, I bought the CD because Jamiroquai has always put out great music. This CD did not disappoint. If you like his last CD Sync., you will like this one. It is more techno/dance oriented than his earlier work, but it is still great. Sure, the two slow songs are a little weak, but the remainder of the CD is solid. Don't be swayed by the negative reviews and buy the CD."
2,Out of ideas,"AFO is just as bad as Synkronized, which is to say a lot. Forget about the great bass lines from their former bassist (Stuart Zender, also co-writer of the most interesting tunes). Since he split up with the band, the lack of new ideas has been dramatic. Instead of keeping the remains of acid jazz/ old school funk alive, the band now dwells in this cheap disco sound which is great fun for a tune, not a whole album. Plus, Jay Kay's attractive although limited vocal range is particularly bad in ballads ( listen to ""Black Crow""and you'll be disappointed by vocals and embarrassed by the lyrics). Do I like them? Yes, they used to be one of my favorite bands, but that was long ago."
2,A little too new for me.,"When I heard that this cd was coming out I was just rediscovering ""travelling without moving."" That was a great cd. I would not call this a great cd. I love ""little L"" and there are some pretty cool songs, but on the whole it doesn't compare to travelling without moving."
4,"A good album, but cold compared to the previous.","This album was better than Synkronized (which doesn't say much),but it's just too shallow for me. Most of the tunes have good beats, but they don't have the depth of Space Cowboy and Virtual Insanity. This album, also,isn't purely funk nor is it an odyssey at 50 minutes."
4,Pretty Good,"J kay and pals have given us another fantsatic album that they should be proud of. The first taster of this album was the single Little L and i have been hooked since. Other favourite tracks of mine are, Feels So Good, Stop Dont Panic, Black Crow and Main Vein. This isnt that different to their previous offerings so i think that all of their fans will love this album as much as i do"
1,Garbage,"After the departure of Stuart Zender and the remainder of the original band members, Jamiroquai is now nothing more than a novelty group.And this craptacular album pretty much proves to the group to be just that."
5,....And They Play On!!,"Despite it's ironic release date (on 9/11?!) ""A Funk Odyssey"" is Jamiroquai's most daring and hard edged albums.Theby-now traditiona; dance-funk of ""Little L"",""You Give Me Something"",""Feels So Good"" and ""Love Phoolosophy"" are here butso are the subdued,folkish ""Black Crow"" and ""Corner Of The Earth"",showing perhapes Jay K is growing up some.But the tough funky rock of ""Stop,Don't Panic"" is a reminder of THIS bands intentions and goals.And what will they come up with next?I can't wait!"
2,For children parties,"I much agree with reviewer Jason Foster from Detroit. Me and my brother had great expectations towards Jamiroquai's new CD, and they were all squarely frustrated. Give this to your niece on her eighth birthday, she will enjoy dancing to the tunes with her little friends from school. Those past puberty should stick to the first three Jamiro albums (""Emergency on Planet Earth"", ""Return of the Space Cowboy"" and ""Travelling Without Moving""), which were fantastic but apparently exhausted the band."
3,A funk Odyssey?,"I was excited when i found out that jamiroquai was realeasing a new album, however once i listened to it, my excitement soon fizzled. Dont get me wrong ""Funk Odyssey"" is a solid album, but its' not what Jamiroquai is capable of. The early Jamiroquai is by far better in my opinion, (especially Travelling w/o Moving, which i think is the bands best album). The Album has some solid tracks. The first 5 or so are pretty tight, after that it goes a bit downhill. Jamiroquai is still my group, however i hope that they will get back to basics, and stick to what their know for: puttin' out soulful albums complimented w/ phat a** house remixes."
2,Maybe Jamiroquai better stop,It's sad to see a band go astray. Jamiroquai have lost their magic touch. It's a one-man-band with a lead singer who's mind isn't set to making music anymore.The whole album is sooooo predictable: All the songs have the same Top 40 structure: verse - chorus - verse - chorus - solo - verse (2X). Where's the originality??I gave two stars because Jay still is a competent songwriter >>> Little l is a good disco song.But this album is nowhere near EOPE or ROTSC.
2,same Formula,"at first Jamiroquai doing the Stevie Wonder Vibe was cool but it has been down hill after the 2nd Album.nothing changed.like Hot fries if you don't eat them right away they get cold as soon as you hit the corner&the corner is the next step.Jamiroquai has hit that corner&with not much changing in the Music,Arrangements&Lyrical Content it's pretty much now leftovers that weren't suppose to be."
1,This is the worst Jamirqouai I ever heard!,"I have been a fan of JK & the band when I was 11 yrs old in Texas. I research plenty of the old & new albums with great lyrics but when they came out with Little L, I was pissed off yet I gave the song the a chance. But the album, please this kill off my collection of the bands music!The worst, even Dynamite won me over as a comeback.What A Funk Odyssey? Get out of here."
5,"NOW YOU SEE THEM, NOW YOU DON'T","One of the team's BEST ventures. The boys play two dimwitted private detectives who try to help boxer Arthur Franz clear himself of a murder charge. Franz has been framed for the murder of his manager by crooked mobster Sheldon Leonard. The film has the BEST special effects ever filmed, especially at the end,in which Lou after giving Franz a blood transfusion,TEMPORARILY becomes invisible,and when he materializes discovers that his legs are NOW BACKWARD. One the film's BEST highlights is the HILARIOUS boxing match which has become one of the FUNNIEST fight scenes ever captured on film."
2,Continuous horror satire; but never bad.,Bud and Lou help to clear a boxer who has been framed for murder. Many classic scenes help to make this one of the better entries in the horror/science fiction spoof series.
5,nice invisible man and very funny movie.,"This movie is extremely hilarious and will please any Abbott and Costello fan! The Invisible man character is just as great as any old time Invisible man character of old films! The film has no crude or gross jokes like the modern dumb comedies today do! The film is simple clean joking,but does contain an average amount of violence to give it a PG rating. I do not know why people frame people for murders as they do in this film. But the character does his best to break the killers arms. The killers deserve what they get! A conclusion adds that this one is one of Bud and Costellos best movies!!"
5,Oldie but Goodie,"I had this tape when my oldest daughter was born in '91. I wish it were still in print, so to speak. It was great having kids songs sung by contemporary artists who created fun recordings that didn't grate on your nerves after hours of listening to kids' songs. I now have a new baby & can't find my tape so want a new copy to keep us both entertained."
5,Great Songs!!!,1. Give a Little Love2. This Old Man3. Cushie Butterfield4. Mary Had a Little Lamb5. Ballad of Davy Crockett6. Itsy Bitsy Spider7. Chicken Lips and Lizard Hips8. Country Feelin's9. Blueberry Pie10. Pacifier11. Getting to Know You12. Autumn to May13. Child of Mine14. Tell Me Why15. Medley of Rhymes16. Blanket for a Sail17. Goodnight My Love (Pleasant Dreams)18. Gartan Mother's Lullaby19. Golden Slumbers20. Child Is Born
2,For The Children - CD,"This was not the CD I wanted. Apparently there are two ""For the Children"" albums. I wanted the original one and I got a newer version, which has different songs. I have searched the site over and over and cannot find out how to order the original one."
4,"Patronizing, but worthwhile!","I rushed out and bought this book after my instructor recommended it in class. While not dissapointed with the content, I am neither thrilled. I found the tone of the book to by condescending, and a bit simple-minded--the founder of the ""60-second EMT"" was placed on a near God level throughout the book. Despite this, I found the book helpful in bringing together certain presenting symptoms and then categorizing them in an understandable way."
3,Be patient with it,Ive been an EMT for 3 years and I am preparing to go to medic school in the next few months. The book has helped my assessments and thinking outside the box. If the author could pep it up a bit and get away from the dull storyline it could be the perfect tool to increase your assessment performance.
3,"Good info, but annoying","No doubt the book has good information and includes a quick, systematic approach to patient care. The problem is it's written like the script of a late-night infomercial. Seems like the authors are more interested in the sales pitch of a concept rather than objectively and responsibly writing a medical reference. But it is valuable information so if you can stomach the gratuitously printed narcissism (and I recommend reading in short increments), get that wallet out and buy one for your bookshelf!"
2,For the new EMT.,"Someone said ""patronizing"" and I've got to agree. But . . . the content is there.The 60 Second EMT reads in parable style, that is, it's a collection of moralistic patient care stories that remind us of what we should already be doing out there. And, it reads down to us. But the message is right on. So . . . I'd recommend this book to new EMTs; and I'd love to see it rewritten with the help of a novelist. Then this style of delivery might really succeed."
4,DIFFERENT SOUNDS,"UNCERTAIN AS TO WHY I LIKE THIS 'MAI AI HEE' SO MUCH, IT'S SIMPLY FUN AND DIFFERENT."
2,Rim is way too big,"I'm not complaining too much because the hat was relatively inexpensive. However, the rim is way too big for the hat."
5,FOR GROWN-UPS TOO,"I read Mistress Masham's Repose when I was 11 years old, and re-read it now as a Grandparent. It is magical, yet plausible that a little girl could enter such a fantasy world. Both my Granddaughter and my Greatniece will receive a copy for their birthdays with a note telling them why this book has not lost its charm through the years."
2,"unrealistic garbage story,but readable",the first half of the book was o'k. in the second half he (writer) probably grew wings himself and flew out of his mind
1,dissapointing,i guess reading the black market and the escapades of alex cross & company made it difficult to really like this book. bring on more alex & company.
4,Quite a change for Patterson,"While I was a little disappointed that Alex Cross was not the main character, I soon got into Frannie the vet., Kit the FBI agent, and Max the little angel. Because of the easy reading format, I read it this weekend. Yes, it is a new realm for Patterson, but I felt he dealt with it (genetic engineering) in a knowledgeable way. I enjoyed the characters, the concept, and the ending. Just because he left serial killers behind, doesn't make it a bad read. Thumbs up from me."
3,"Not Exactly ""Cat & Mouse"", but...","I am a hugh Patterson fan. I have read most of his books and have loved every one of them. However, this latest book leaves something to be desired. Once you get Alex Cross out of your head it isn't too bad. I liked the characters and the way they interacted and bonded. The storyline was a little far-fetched but just realistic enough to scare you into believing it could happen or be happening right now. The ending was just mushy enough without being a real tearjerker. Not up there with his best, but still a decent read."
1,Definitely not the quality of his previous novels,"After reading the other reviews, it is obvious that this is one book that you either loved or hated.Put me in the last category.I was used to Patterson's usual ""keep the pages turning"" style so much that I never blinked an eye when I shelled out the money for this book as soon as it came out.MISTAKE! I had all I could do to keep my eyes open while dragging my way through this book.This was just too difficult to believe--winged children? Sounds like something from a bizarre, twisted fairy tale. Please bring back Alex Cross! Just in case, when Patterson's next book comes out,I'm going to borrow it before I buy."
5,I loved this book. It was Patterson's best so far.,"From the moment I began reading this latest Patterson work, I couldn't put it down. I found the topic timely, the premise fascinating, and the writing hypnotic. I have recommended it without reservation to others. If you liked Patterson in the past, you will love this one."
2,So easy to read it should be required reading for 7th grade,"I read this book in one day. Not because I am a fast reader, but because the story was such a fluff piece. The story is just interesting enough to keep your interest, but it goes nowhere. Not nearly as interesting as his others. Wait for it to come out in paperback."
4,A quick & entertaining read,"I have read all of Patterson's ""Alex Cross"" books, and have enjoyed them all. I knew this one was going to be different, because my wife read it first. After the first few chapters, the pages just flew by. It is unusual, but very enjoyable."
2,Predictable,"James Patterson has been my favorite author since I read Kiss the Girls. Everytime that he writes a new book I buy it. This book would make me think twice before doing that again. Usually a Patterson book is unpredictable. You can't believe who the actual bad guy is at the end of the novel. In When the Wind Blows I correctly guess 95% of what was happening next. The premise for the story was great, but the plot didn't provide the enjoyment."
4,An Extraordinary Book by an Extraordinary Author!,"I am a huge James Patterson fan! I love the way he allows his chapters to flow quickly and fluidly. He takes the time to develope characters that you can relate with. This story had me on the edge of my seat from the get go, and I couldn't put the book down. It went with me everywhere I went! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the style of writing of James Patterson. If you are looking to find Alex Cross I cannot help you. However, there are some rather gripping characters!"
2,Interesting premise but poorly written,"I did enjoy this Dean Koontz-ish story line and I have to admit that I plowed through the book in record time. But I was apalled at the choppy and almost juvenile writing style, if you can call it ""style"". I appreciate good writing and it stunned me that a book written this poorly could be accepted for publication. If I were an editor I'd say, ""Yikes, Jim, you can do better than this!"""
4,Excellent flow of the plot,"This is not, in my opinion, James Patterson's best book to date. However, it is a very entertaining and a pleasure to read. I couldn't wait to find what happened, page after page. Given to me as a Christmas present, I simply couldn't put the book down till early Christmas morning. Well worth reading, no-matter how much of an Alex Cross fan you are."
1,This book is HORRIBLE!,"I can't believe his publisher allowed this book to be distributed. I kept waiting for a story, it's really just an outline. There is no character development for any of the characters. Reading the book is about as detailed as someone telling you about a book they have read. I only kept reading it because I could not believe it was that bad. I am returning the book to the store for a refund, and will be very cautious about buying his next book."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I too read an advance copy of When the Wind Blows and was very disappointed both in the concept and the writing. While I applaud Mr. Patterson for refusing to be caught in a ""genre"" trap, I felt that the reader was being lured by the promise of a new Alex Cross by the nursery rhyme title. As a suspense novelist, Patterson has few equals, however I wishe he had been wise enough to leave the supernatural-suspense field to Stephen King and Dean Koontz."
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!,"I have read every book by James Patterson has written and felt that they were all readable. I consider his Alex Cross books to be excellent. His latest, however,When The Wind Blows, is not only HIS worst book, it is one of the worst books I've read in many years. This book has no redeeming qualities--the writing style is amateurish, the characters are plastic and, worst of all, the dialogue is awful. Do yourself a favor and read ANYTHING else but When The Wind Blows."
1,A dreary parade of tired cliches,"A misguided friend gave me an early copy of this genuine Grade A stinker. The writing is so bad you wonder if all the editors at the publishing house didn't take the week off. Perhaps they gave up on the dreadful, dumb story, or trying to correct the endless parade of pseudo-tense cliches - or maybe they just thought we were all too dumb to notice. This has to be one of the worst thrillers I've ever read. Do I really have to give it one whole star??"
4,Wow!,"At first, I thought Patterson had finally lost it and decided to try his hand at science fiction (which I find very boring at best). However, as I read further this realistic-fictional story became a page turner rather quickly. The questions this story raised about the manipulation of human DNA to serve an evil purpose, not only made my skin crawl, but forced me to bring this possibility to a conscious level for which I'd rather not. This story made me think while it kept me on the edge of my seat."
1,Huh?,"Having read some of Mr. Patterson's earlier books, I found this one to be thoroughly disappointing. Had I taken it out of the library instead of stupidly buying the hardcover, I would have never finished it. A dopey premise, a dopey ending, by what seems to be, a rapidly becoming dopey author. I have since read ""Pop Goes the Weasel"", and now find myself wondering what I saw in this guy in the first place. He is going downhill in a big way. No more of my money for you Mr. Patterson."
1,I expected more from Patterson,"I have read nearly all the Alex Cross books and was eagerly anticpating a new James Patterson novel, but strongly disappointed with this one. Children with wings.....Give me a break!"
3,Unusual Story From Patterson,"An unusual story line from Patterson. The reviewers here who decided not to finish this book, missed a heart stopping action-packed ending. The writing did seem a little sophomoric in places but story moved along at a good pace. The likeable characters were likeable and the unlikable characters were despicable. As it should be. Had me wondering how in the world Patterson came up with this one."
3,"Interesting and a page turner ,but I miss Alex Cross.","The book was entertaining and keep my interest ,but I feel Patterson could have done more with the subject of genetic engineering. This read was more like a fairy tail. I cannot wait for the next Alex Cross novel."
4,"A heartwarming, yet mysterious plot","This was an incredible reader. It touched your heart, yet kept you going. The children's characters were believeable, it makes you wonder if this kind of testing is really going on."
2,Flat,"My first Patterson experience, coming over from Koontz and King, though it's my understanding that his other works are better. Truly disappointed, but fortunately it was a quick read."
2,This is NOT a James Patterson book,"I simply cannot believe this book was written by James Patterson. The writing is amateruish with too many loose and open ends. One finds the characters Kit and Frannie hard to relate to. Patterson should stick to what he does best, entertaining us brilliantly with his suspense thrillers. Emulating Michael Chrichton is not his forte and will probably cause him to lose faithful readers like myself."
1,Do not read!,"Patterson is an author I enjoy reading, but I could find no bright spots in this poorly written SF(?) attempt. The characters were boring and one demensional. The Plot takes twists and turns, just for the sake of taking twists and turns. There seems to be little reason for the actions of each character. Also, the description of action scenes are hard to follow."
5,The best James Patterson book i've read.,"I've read all the James Patterson books that I can get a hold of. And this book I read read with-in two days. It was the best of his writings that i've read, and I can't wait for the next one to come out. I suggest if you haven't read this book, and if you enjoy a good crime triller i really think you should get off your butt and get this book, as it'll keep you on the edge your seat."
4,Unusually Satisfying!,"This novel definitely lacked the good guy, bad guy plot. It wasn't overkill. I liked the way he changed his style a bit. I have enjoyed every single novel by James Patterson, this one was just as good but in a different way."
3,"Interesting Story, not a bad book","I was given the ""audio"" version of this book to listen to during my commute and found that it was really a fairly interesting story. I don't know how believable all of the science was but it definitely kept my attention. At times it was slow and the end could have ended a little earlier and different, but overall I would recommend it to anyone interested in that kind of thing (genetics, experimenting in bilogy/genetics, etc.)."
1,Patterson should stick to the cop/thrillers; want Alex Cross,Having kids fly is so ridiculous. I don't read Dean Koontz/King because I like the gory thrillers that could happen; not supernatural stuff. Very disappointed. Along Came a Spider was great; and could not be put down.
1,Save your money,"I enjoyed James Patterson's previous novels although I am not a rabid fan. This book was not up to his usual standards. The premise was interesting but poorly executed. I found the short chapters (126 chapters in a 400 page book!) annoying and distracting. As a veterinarian I was also annoyed by the incorrect descriptions of Frannie's veterinary medicine. You'd think a big author like Patterson or his editor would check the details on an unfamiliar subject. My advice is if you must read this book, get it from the library."
2,Good story,"The overall idea of the story was interesting. I just think that the way Patterson described certain things lacked intelligence. He kept adding little phrases that would have been better had they been left out. This is the second book by Patterson that I've read and this is the worst one so far. Still, I'm keeping the faith and I hope that things get better in the future."
5,When the Wind Blows is awesome!,"""When the Wind Blows"" is an exciting book I have read! I couldn't put the book down because of all the suspense and odd occurences that kept happening. The author is James Patterson. This book reminds me of other books written by Thomas Harris, Michael Crichton, Stephen King, or Dean R. Koontz. All of these authors write exciting, terrifying. scary and overall thrilling books. Give that bestseller book a try because I give it a 10!"
1,Good idea- Terrible story line,"The idea is sound. But the behavior of the main characters defies logic at times. People just aren't THAT stupid. Just one example from the book: if you know people are looking for you, and you know they know where you live, you just Do. Not. Go. Home!"
1,This book was disappointing and inane.,"I have read all of the author's other books and enjoyed them. This one disappointed me. Although it was easy reading I found it badly written. Genetic engineering may be upon us, but I found the book inane. I also don't know why Mr. Patterson thinks that a child with wings is beautiful."
2,Disappointed,"James Patterson was an author recommended to me but I unfortunately bought his When the Wind Blows first. I liked the short chapters. The plot was completely predictable though, and the book probably should have ended halfway through. I was constantly trying to figure out who the ""I"" was that was speaking because it read like a man's point of view and not the heroine, Frannie. If it were not for the very slight touch of romance and the swear words, I would recommend this book to my 11 year old. Having read some of the other reviews, I will choose a different one of Patterson's books (certainly not The Lake House since it is a continuation of When the Wind Blows)and try to figure out how his books have become #1 bestsellers."
3,Could this really happen?,"Could this really happen? Maybe it does now or maybe in the future. The author really makes you feel for the characters and some scenes I could really ""hear"" and ""smell"" the situation. I agree that its an ""Island of Dr. Moreau"" like book. Other Patterson books are better but this one is still OK."
2,When the wind blows,"Very easy reading but too far-fetched. I really wanted to know how his story ended but left me with an empty feeling on the other hand once finished. Yes, a happy ending but I didn't get a clue how the childrens' parents were found. I liked his Jack and Jill much more."
4,What a Fun Read!,"What an interesting idea, and believable, genetically altered children with superhuman intellect and strength who are like normal children in every other way except that they fly. Totally engaging. I often found myself with a smile on my face and wishing these kids really existed so I could meet them.One thing I like about Patterson is that he, unlike most suspense novelists, goes out of his way to give the reader a believable excuse that the protagonist does not go to the police. Most novels leave you with the conclusion that the hero suddenly takes idiot pills and that's why he/she doesn't go to the police. In this story, Patterson makes it somewhat understandable why Kit and Frannie don't call for backup.The one thing I'd like to ask Mr. Patterson: is it really believable that an FBI agent could be such a renegade and survive in that agency? That said, thank you sir, for a great experience of fantasy and fun."
1,silliest book I've read in years,"What a waste of my time and Patterson's talent. Totally unbeleivable, sophmoric writing. If Paterson needs money that bad, lets take up a collection. The blurbs on the book cover did not give a hint that this was science fantasy. Wish I had bought it through amazon.com so I would have read the reader reviews."
3,"Well, in the end, it blows","(...) I gave it 3 stars because there weren't 2 1/2. The first half of the book it keeps repeating the same things too much, and the ending seems like it was done in a rush, too quick, and really you felt your time was wasted for all that reading. A so-so story, but nothing that leaves you satisfied. I'm giving James Patterson a 2nd try with Roses Are Red & Violets Are Blue. I dont really recommend this one..."
2,Unusual but disappointing with factual errors as well.,"What a disappointment, although I did read the entire book. Conceptually, some of it was attractive, but reality checks along the way simply didn't fit. Yelling at a little girl flying around while Frannie is careening along a road in a car and helicopters above--and being heard by the little girl Max. There were many improbabilities similar to this as well as a few factual errors. The use of isoflurine (isofluorethane) on a bird is very accurate - our two birds were anesthetized with the stuff two days ago, but recovery is very rapid. Also further along, the sudden use of military time when they all meet their parents displayed an obvious ignorance: 0200 is 2:00 a.m. and not 2 p.m. as implied. I will look twice at the next Patterson book before I buy it. I suggest that he return to his tried and true mysteries. Those were excellent."
2,Flying Children,"It's all a matter of taste, but I just couldn't get into this story. Didn't finish the book. This is one series I will not be looking forward to."
3,A little strange.........,"This book was strange. It had some of Patterson's usual plot twists, but was very atypical of him. I was not expecting children with wings flying in the wilderness, and strange genetic research.Kip and Frannie are good characters, but I think they could have been developed a little more. I think that more could have gone into Frannie's husbands death and his involvement in the whole case and how he tied into everything.This was an average book, not what I would expect from Patterson."
3,"Strong characters, justs lacks something.","James patterson does indeed have a strong story here, ...somewhere. As usual this book is written in the classic writing style of the great Patterson. Extreamly strong characters that are easy to identify with, even the ones that fly, however the story its self lacks something that is just hard to put my finger on. I still was entertained with this read but I think he could have done more with the actual story line."
3,Patterson should stick to Alex Cross novels!,"Luckily, this wasn't the first Patterson novel I'd read or it likely would have been the last. I nearly gave up on it early on but stuck with it and it did manage to get better, but not nearly as good as the 6 or so other books of his I've read so far. It starts out too creepy too fast and the writing is clumsy in places (especially when it comes to ""romantic"" scenes). When the Wind Blows proved an entertaining enough book to read, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it when there are so many better offerings by Patterson. I'm now reading Violets are Blue and enjoying Patterson's direct but not heavy-handed treatment of Detective Alex Cross and his current, gruesome case."
5,Every Time The Wind Blows...,"You will remember this book. Every time you hear about a news story about bio-medical technology and gene research, you will remember this book. Patterson crafts such an immense amount of science and human emotions in one book...even intertwining the two on the same page, it is guaranteed to reach you whether you are a 'by the book' fact finder or a romantic at heart, a true believer of human love and life. This book takes you on the journey of a lifetime...flying through the trees on the wings of a girl whose DNA has been altered, to the mothering instinct a doctor feels for her. You can't say that you knew where this one was going...Turn the pages as fast as you can."
2,When the Wind Blows,"I have read a number of James Patterson's books and especially liked Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider. I was looking forward to this book, but I must say, it was an extreme disappointment. The book was very disjointed and completely unrealistic. Most mysteries and thrillers, when discussing things that may seem improbable or are rooted in science provide a background of scientific information that prepares the reader and helps them accept the unlikely or impossible. This does not and in several places, an eye roll or out loud laugh is appropriate. It was poorly written and very disappointing. I would hesitate to buy another one of his books."
2,Please,"I appreciate that Patterson did some research on this subject but he goes too far with the idea. Fantasy is ok, but don't try and convience me that it's not. The characters is this book are way too rigid and one dimensional, if I had liked them more maybe I could have gone beyond the premise and enjoyed the book. This was my first Patterson book, and while I might give him one more chance, my advice if your considering this one is try a different one first to see if you like the author because there is no way this is the best he has to offer."
3,Different,It was definitely different than anything he's ever written before. It kept me interested but at the same time sometime confused. It was action filled and I enjoyed the read.
3,Not what I was expecting!,"A big fan of James Patterson, mainly because of Alex Cross, this book was quite a surprise. Where did he come up with the idea? As silly as the plot was, I couldn't put it down. I'd prefer more Alex Cross, but if Patterson wants to detour every now and then, I can handle that too."
1,This bird won't hunt,"Have read every Patterson book and liked every one. This departure from Alex Cross is a mistake. Book has a good idea but did not care for the content - clever but boring if you can believe it. Standard fare of oppressed good guys against insurmountable odds, etc. etc. etc. If you must read this - go to your local library and save the cash. Not much to brag about here."
1,SILLY!!!!,"Please, please bring back Alex Cross, his grandmother,and his two kids!!This book was just silly, what were you thinking?"
3,"Hey, it's worth a few hours of your day...","It's an interesting read - the premise is intriguing, although not terribly original. Reading some of the customers' comments, I don't believe that it was a COMPLETE waste of time. I am trying to encourage a friend to read more, and this would be a good book to start with. The chapters go by fast, the characters are interesting, and the plot twists are good!"
1,Disappointment!,"This book was such a disappointment after the previous novels from James Patterson. Story lines were not followed through, writing was at an elementary school level. Plot booring. It did not even seem like Patterson wrote this one!"
3,"Interesting, once one realizes it's more science fiction","As an avid reader of James Patterson's previous books, it took me a long time to get into this book, while I read other books...before I finally read the last two-thirds of this book. Eventually, I got into it...but it wasn't what I expected from Patterson and maybe I was part of the problem, because I was so accustomed to his previous writings."
3,Interesting..........,"Not one of Pattersons best books, although it was very entertaining and a break from the usual Patterson novel. I enjoyed the book to say the least but I am also ready for the next Alex Cross novel."
1,Did James Patterson really write this book?,I have read all of James Patterson's books. This one is so unlike any of the others and definitely not up to his standards of writing. It reads like it was written by a juvenile. He should stick with his former style of writing. His Alex Cross novels are the best. I kept wondering why he would write a novel such as this. He is not good at science fiction. I was disappointed in this book.
1,Is a negative star rating an option?,"This is the first and last Patterson book for me. The fanciful plot never gained any substance or picked up steam. It became painful to read this book. The writing was poor, the characters unbelievable. The suspense, unsuspenseful. I kept thinking to myself that it couldn't get any worse, so I would keep reading. But it did. All the way to the epilogue. ""So many books, so little time."" So please, save your time and pick up a good book."
5,Amazing,This book was a total page turner. I loved it. I finished it in a day n' half. I couldn't put it down. I totaly recomend it.
4,One of James Patterson's Best Novels,"""When the Wind Blows"" strays away from Mr. Patterson's usual writing style. This is one of my favorite novels by James Patterson (Kiss the Girls follows the lead)."
4,When the wind blows,"I must say I was a bit shocked when I started ""When the wind blows"". Not at all what I'm used to from James Patterson. However, once I started I couldn't stop and read the book all night (thankfully it was a Saturday night).His style is still the same - short, sharp chapters and characters that take on a life of their own. Max is an exceptional character and I hope to hear more about her in a sequel. For those people who don't read the preface - this one is worth reading and will make your skin crawl- Patterson suggests that there may just be a small amount of truth in his story.A great read if you are into science fiction or just like a story ""with a difference""."
1,"Should Have Been Named ""When Children Fly""","This book is below Patterson's usual quality and is not worth your time. Book should have been titled ""When Children Fly"" since that is the primary focus of the book. Patterson got too caught up in the act of flying vs. a good story line."
2,Do I have to finish it?,"Yes, this is a quick read, that is if you can manage to get pass the urge not to finish it. ""Wind"" was pretty good until I got half-way through. Then, it turned into a made for TV movie. I've been putting off reading the last 100 pages (which in actuality would only take about 45 minutes to read, tops) just because I've lost all interest in the characters. The book's premise is noble enough, but the way it developed is weak and incredibily unbelievable."
1,An ill wind,"Normally I wouldn't hesitate to praise James Patterson. I have loved all of his books...until this one. But this fantasy was over the top, and just not my cup of tea. I would suggest that now that Mr. Patterson has gotten this fable off his chest, he get right back to doing what he does better than anyone else....the super mystery thriller. Please."
5,A classic present time of murders and angels,"When the wind Blows is one of the best books that I have read. A story that wants to keep the read turning the pages. The book has you in total suspense, and asking what would happen next. Murders chasing angels in a result in doctors dieing. It's alot like kiss the girls with suspenes and mystorie, you should probably read When the wind blows by James Patterson"
2,could do better,Lots of chapters-why? I think he wanted to make the book bigger.The story follows the lives of Frannie and her mysterious lodgerKit who stumble across a load of kids with wings. In this day and age the story can be considered quite plausible and in the way it's told quite readable but at the end of the day it was just another book on the shelf-nothing special.
2,"Started Good, got Boring, Ended Bad","The build-up of the encounter with the mysterious girl who is the centerpiece of the book was interesting and held my attention very well. But soon after that, the plot development took a downhill turn and kept going... There seemed to be too much focus on the romantic stuff and not enough on the thrilling mystery stuff. I wanted so badly to read more character development with the girl and found her ""normalcy"" other than the obvious abnormal things, to be unbelievable. I was disappointed with the entire last half of the book. Written in beach-language, but not even a good summer beach read."
4,You've Got to Read This,"You might not want to read my review; I kind of give away a little bit about the book.The one to two page chapters make this book very easy and fast to read. James Patterson writes so well; I've also read Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls (the movie of which I love).This book was so . . . true to life, I think. I mean, you've got to admit that the government probably does have some strange things going on that we don't know about. Maybe not about bird-children, but that was just Patterson's theory. The story was intriguing, haunting, and suspenseful, and the fact that people in our goverment, people that we trust, might do something like that, is just disturbing.At the end, I got goosebumps, like I always do when something moves me in any way, whether it scares me or makes me happy. This book made me happy. It leaves you with a sense of satisfaction that everything is all right."
2,A Real Struggle,"I am a James Patterson fan. I loved every one of the Alex Cross novels. I've read and enjoyed several in the Women's Murder Club series and I'm becoming a fan of Michael Bennett. This book was a chore. I picked it up and read some, then put it down. I have seldom struggled to get through any novel like this and I am a sci fi fan. I do not recommend this novel at all."
2,Condition of the book,"As soon as the book was opened it began to fall apart at the spine. Since I only paid a penny, guess I can't really complain."
2,Blah...,"It's unfortunate that the most believable parts of this yarn are the flying children. The plot is trite and obvious, and there's little in the way of surprise.Patterson picked a great topic, but his storytelling is unconvincing."
5,Unbelievable made believable,"The title really didn't reveil any thing about the content of the book. I just bought it because of James Patterson's previous breathtaking suspense thrillers. When the wind blows doesn't feature Alex Cross in it, but it is truly magnificent. The little girl, Max, really is a wonderful creature, you'll no doubt fall in love with her. She is so strong, both physically and mentally, despite her age and she makes the book. I couldn't stop reading the book, it is an absolute bestseller. way to go James!"
4,great book!,"I felt this was a great book. Very suspenseful and a fast, can't put it down read. I enjoyed the new character, Frannie, and hope to see more of her in the future. Initially, the plot of winged children was a little hard to swallow, but in only a short time I was hooked! I would highly reccomend this book!"
2,Not one of his greatests books,"I have been hooked on James Patterson's books since I read ""Kiss the Girls"" so I was very excited when I saw he had a new book out. However, I found ""When the Wind Blows"" to be uninteresting and predictable. I had figured out who was behind the genetic testing half-way through the book. After reading his other books, you can figure out a pattern of who the villain is going to be. It is always the last person you suspect, no matter how unlikely this seems. If you are a Patterson fan, I would suggest reading this book, but borrow it from the library rather than buying it."
4,a good time for reading,I liked this book. It was easy to read and it appealed to me to keep reading it. At least the story made sence. But I was a little upset. Bacause I thought it was going to be like his other novels with murderers and cereal killers. But it was still a good book to read.
4,A Good Book,"This book was very interesting. I think it was all together a good book, however there were some parts that got really boring and I wondered if anything interesting would happen. I'm 15 years old, so my point of view on this book may be different then others, but I thought this book was good."
2,Okay,"This was the first Patterson book I read and despite its lightweight contents, I read ""Along Came A Spider"", an Alex Cross novel by Patterson, which was a much better book. As noted in my one-line summary, WTWB was okay. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate it a 5."
4,VERY RIVETING,"Being a first time James Patterson reader, I was surprised to see the pages fly by. Whilst the premise is sci-fi, the terror was real. I felt the book enveloped the reader by drawing them into the many emotions of Frannie and Kit, but feel the ending could have been rounded out a little better."
4,"Fast paced, interesting, worth a look!","I had never read a James Patterson book so this was new. I enjoyed it very much and it was much different from my usual reading, of court room or murder mystery. The book flew, couldn't put down. Yes it was far fetched, but almost scarey when you think about what the medical research had already done. Think of it as a little science fiction, with mystery thrown in. A good book!"
1,Dreadful book!,"First, let me state that I have enjoyed Mr. Patterson's series of books based on the fictional Washington DC detective, Alex Cross. On the strength of those prior books I purchased ""When the Wind Blows"". Before I was through the first chapter I knew I had made a terrible mistake. The book is a supreme disappointment."
4,A quick and interesting read,"As a long time Patterson fan I was somewhat reluctant to read his latest after reading some of the unfavorable reviews. However, I was not disappointed. Patterson kept my interest in this novel as he had kept my interest in his Cross novels. Another success by Patterson."
3,Prefer Alex Cross,This book wasn't Patterson's best. I perfer Alex Cross to a bunch of surf boarding kids trying to save a town.
2,The book does not compare to the author's other works.,"I live to read a new novel by James Patterson. However, I did not enjoy this book anywhere near all the others. I'm just hooked on the Alex Cross series. Sometime it's hard for a fan to switch channels. I can appreciate an author's need and desire to broaden their works. I just expected more from James Patterson. I will continue to read his novel. James Patterson needs to get back to Alex Cross and company. Truly his best works."
4,it was awsome (but will it come true),i thought it was a great book and i could really get in to it. it is one day going to be true and i can only hope that it dose not turn out the horrid way it was written
4,Strange....but good,"C'mon guys! This is not that bad!Yes, its a little out there, but thats the beauty of writing-there are no limits on a writers imagination. As much as I like the Alex Cross character, it would get boring having the same character in every book. I found the plot of this story very interesting-with characters being able to have superhuman powers-it would make for an interesting movie. Read this book with an open mind."
3,Interesting turn for Patterson,James Patterson out Dean Koontzed - Dean Koontz. If you are looking for Alex Cross or anything near that genre you are out of luck. This is one of the better Sci-Fi thriller books I have read.
2,Bring back Alex!,"James, you are a superb writer. But, please, do not write anymore books without Alex Cross. WTWB was certainly a departure from the norm. Not a good idea. I was disappointed. I am sure most of your Alex fans were disappointed as well.If ain't broke, don't fix it. I am looking forward to your next book with Alex Cross!"
1,"Boy, did this suck.","(...) This was my first Patterson book and it's likely to put me off Patterson forever! I'd give it a negative five stars if possible. What a shoddy, cheap, crappy attempt at churning a novel out as fast as possible. People say they READ it in one night? I think Patterson WROTE it in one night. It was like a story written for a freshman English class. HORRIBLE!"
5,Amazing!,"I loved the whole concept of this book. Old Alex Cross got a bit tiresone and this is a fresher novel from Patterson. Brilliantly told, the plot has believability and tension in all the right places. But will we see more of these incredible books from this talented author? Well, Pop Goes the Weasel is yet another Cross book. No offence, but look what happened to Alex Delaware!"
2,Boring.,"This book is umpredictably dispointing. It's a completely non-sense thriler. By the way, Patterson is umpredictable himself: very good books mxed with bad ones."
1,The very worst!,"I have always been a James Patterson fan and thought his books were among the best. However, When The Wind Blows is by far the very worst disjointed book he has ever written. The story weaves back and forth so many times that the reader is left to wonder just where, and what, the story was about. I am being very generous in giving this book ONE STAR!"
1,"""When the Winds Blows"" -Blows","I couldn't believe what I was reading once I was reading it! I was hoping Alex Cross was going to pop out of the woods and save the day (and the novel). But as I got closer to finishing this book, I realized not even Cross could save this atrocity."
1,just obnoxious,"Am I the only one who found ""Maximum"" the winged girl annoying? The same can be said for Frannie the vet. I was so disappointed with this book; I couldn't wait to get through it just so I could finally be done with it. The subject is a big departure from Patterson's previous bestsellers, and I have to say he did a terrible job with it. I am not the least bit interested in flying children. The obnoxious ""love affair"" between Kit and Frannie frankly made me nauseous. How much more unbelievable could this couple be? And how many more references to how Max felt while she was flying could Patterson have made? WHO CARES! This reminds me of Patricia Cornwell and ""Hornet's Nest"". Take a pass on this drivel."
2,Waste of time,"An 11-year old girl with wings?? I don't read Patterson for science fiction. I kept reading because I was looking for something positive, but it never came."
1,A complete rip-off. Plot and characters are simple minded.,"This book was NOT written in the previous style that author James Patterson writes in. The author should have changed his name to ""Jane Patterson"". This book reads like one of those so-called romance novels that women love to read. The plot is unbelievable, simple, stupid. The characters, who are supposed to be very smart people, are totally stupid and completely lacking in common sense. The sheer volume of emotional outpourings from the characters made me sick! This story would appeal to young immature teen-age girls but not to any adult that has any common sense!"
2,Egh.....,"Although Patterson has never been my favorite author, I have really enjoyed the previous books I've read from him, especially the new Lindsay Boxer ( I believe that's her name) series. Absolutely wonderful. But this book was very poorly written with bad dialogue, uninteresting characters, and a silly story line. This is something I would expect from a young writer just starting out, not one as seasoned as Patterson. Although he had the usual 2-3 page chapters (or less) it was absolutely dreadful getting to the end. Unless you're a compltely devoted Patterson fan, skip this one."
2,Not a good one.,What a disappointment this book was. Mr Patterson has always been one of my favorite authors. It was just too far out there.
1,Dear Mr Patterson,"What IN THE WORLD made you you write this piece of junk? I guess you just wanted to try something different. Really enjoyed all your other books. But PALEEZE don't try this again. I did finish it, just to see how bad it was. With your short, short chapters I got very good at skipping to the last sentence and knowing everthing about the chapter. This is rally shameful and you know it."
2,"The premise was interesting, but the story was dragged out.","Compared to Patterson's previous books, this was disappointing. The repetitive description of Max's feelings were irrelevant to the story and arrogant. While the plot was unusual, I did not appreciate chapters being one page."
1,This is a book that should never have been published!,"If this book had been written by anyone other than a well known author, it would never, never have been published. The characters are unbelievably flat. The premise, while intriguing, is poorly executed. It got one star from me only because there was not a zero star choice!"
1,A Good Idea In Search of A Writer,"This book is a huge disappointment given the quality of Patterson's previous thrillers. Although the basic premise is interesting, the execution is poor and lazy. Everything about it is predictable and obvious - cardboard characters and improbable plotlines abound on every page. Venturing into the realm of science/fiction/fantasy, Patterson manages to dredge up nearly every cliche of the genre without any originality or style. It's a quick read - and you get the feeling that Patterson spent less time writing it than you'll spend reading it."
1,Disappointed!,I have to say I was very disappointed in this book. I kept waiting for the old James Patterson style to shine through but it just wasn't there. It used to be that when he wrote a new book I bought it sight unseen - not anymore.
2,James Patterson Lite,"The characters and the premise were fine. I just wish that he had added more suspense. I liked the story, but kept waiting for something truly exciting to happen; unfortunately it never did. Certainly worth reading, but not as good as his other books (Cross AND non Cross)."
3,WHO wrote this?,"""When the Wind Blows"" reads so much like a Dean Kootz book, it's frightening. (Well, not really frightening...just kinda weird.) The main characters have that Kootz-esque feel about them (the men mysterious and handsome, the women bright, gutsy and independent and the children smart and unusual), the plot is paper-thin, and the title has little to do with the story at all!While Kootz has many fans and has had a ba-zillion bestsellers, he's not exactly the author I'd like to see cloned in the future (maybe Anne Tyler, perhaps John Irving...I could even live with Stephen King). To see Patterson move from his exciting, fast-paced and (arguably) believable mystery genre to this sci-fi/conspiracy/thriller is a disappointment."
3,"While a good novel, not his best",His other books have held me spell-bound. At times I had difficulty keeping my interest. The average time for me to read one of his books is probably two evenings. This one took a week of evenings
1,Where's Alex Cross when you need him?,"I also read an advanced copy of this book and I had to wonder if Mr. Patterson was planning another rewrite or if this was actually the finished product. The story concept intrigued me, but the book itself was a major disapointment. I suggest people re-read ""Cat & Mouse"" instead of buying this book."
1,Silly premise. Contrived characters.,"If one suspends reality and imagines a huge secret project being run by medical geniuses in Colorado that is creating children with wings to fly, and astonishing intelligence, and if one buys into the sale of these creatures to foreign (and unfriendly) countries (for who knows what purpose), and adds mysterious deaths, a lonely but independent beautiful, widowed woman vet, with awareness problems about her late husband and current friends, and the mysterious, handsome, stranger with a secret, you have all the elements of an afternoon soap opera. So, if you like soap operas - go for it."
1,Garbage!,"I just have one question to ask: How does such abominable garbage ever, ever get printed. If this was the first book that Mr. Patterson pitched to a publisher they would laugh him out of the building. This is a book I would use to teach my four year old son how to read. The sentences were absurd being three or four words long. I even quoted some of the lines to my mom and dad and we had quite the laugh. I don't know what his other books are like but this one was horrendous."
1,Stop it now for the sake of us all,Does this guy have a medical condition that prevents him from writing more than five words without adding a full stop? This was a style that worked most successfully for me - for a year 8 creative writing essay. And really with all the rainforests dissappearing does he really need to start a new chapter every other page. I think basic grammar lessons are in order.If this guy really needs the money that much i am quite willing to start up a collection.You have one more chance Mr Patterson.
1,Don't rush out and buy this book,"Appallingly written, I read about two thirds of this book, and then didn't even bother to finish it. I'd just finished reading the beautifully written The Loop by Nicholas Evans, and I couldn't stop comparing the two styles of writing, the plot and the characters of the two books.What a disappointment."
1,avoid all eye contact!,"I usually enjoy this author, but I found this book a great disapppointment. I found myself in a situation where I could not wait for the book to end."
1,Formulaic and DULL!!,"This book reads as if the author has found a leaflet on writing thrillers and followed it to the letter. Corny oh so sexy hero, strong yet vulnerable heroine, One dimentional bad guys, its all here. I think that if I read another pathetic, unnecessary, wistful sentence using the word fly, flying or any other variant I would have given the book itself a flying lesson from my window! I accept that it was supposed to be a slightly dreamy and tense thriller, but just having cliffhanger after cliffhanger does not cut it. You have to care about the characters to understand their suffering or fears, and you need to relate to the characters to care about them, and if anyone knows anyone who is anything like the people in this book, then you should probably display them in a museum."
1,It would be 0 stars if it were possible...,"Horribly disappointing, especially given the past Alex Cross novels. Patterson tried to create a Crichton-esque novel that would ""push the envelope"" and present frightening implications for our society. He fell way short, however--I've seen better SF in high school. The plot--a genetically-engineered child who can fly--was simply ridiculous, especially for anyone remotely familiar with biotechnology. The characters were flat and stereotyped, while the writing was simplistic. To add insult to injury, there were lapses in story continuity. If Patterson didn't know better than to publish this, his editor should have. Stick with Alex Cross, Mr. Patterson..."
1,Elementary,"Shorten the text, add pictures and voila - a children's book. The plot and dialogue were unusually basic - I'm too old for this stuff."
1,"Very disappointing, poorly written book","I've enjoyed Patterson's Alex Cross series, even though it is rather simplisticly written. However, upon starting this book, I was immediately disappointed with the style. Then, after getting to chapter 6 or so, the chapter ended with the cliffhanger, 'It was a trap!' The next chapter started with, 'No, it wasn't.' What was that? For a moment, I felt like I was reading my kids another R. L. Stine Goosebumps book. Don't try to fool the reader so obviously, Mr. Patterson, it made me drop the book like a hot coal."
1,Not worth reading,"I read the book and enjoyed it while I was reading it, but after it was over I just realized how much time I wasted. I truly hate James Patterson's narrative and writing style. I think his books are aimed at a generation that hates to read. Everyone enjoys his short chapters, but to me they are a cop out. If you put all of the paragraphs together and the chapters were longer, the books would be dime novels."
2,very average,"This book is very repetitive. Not worth reading, unless you are a fan of the author or the topic ."
1,Garbage,"I have one word for this book: GARBAGE. If I could have chosen no stars, I would have. I liked Kiss the Girls but none of his later books even measured to that. I couldn't get up to page 100 in this one. Pure undeveloped, not thought provoking, shallow trash."
3,Enjoyable fast read...,I found the two main characters interesting and a good match while they investigated the bird children. However it defied logic that they didn't tell the press and blow away the power of secrey the villans had.
2,Disappointing story and overly simple language.,"I couldn't wait to read the latest Patterson novel. What an unpleasant surprise. I cannot believe this book was written by the same author who wrote Kiss the Girls, etc. In fact, I looked to see if maybe another person co-wrote this book. The language is feminine, as if a woman wrote the book. The sentences are written on a 5th grade level - boring. I finished the book because I was curious to see how it ended. The entire story is too far-fetched. Hopefully Patterson will get back to writing for an adult audience with his next book."
5,Very Engrossing!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I had never read anything by this author before and have subsequently read most of his work! I believe fiction gets some of its bite from truth! And this stuff is really happening check out some of the biotech companies who are currently harvesting human organs! I read this book cover to cover. Mr. Patterson Thanks for the fun!"
4,"it's not great, but better than most","i've read about half of this book so far. ive read all but one of patterson's novels. this one is by far the most fantasy based. i can see why a lot of people wouldn't like it, but i really think its a good book."
4,Not his Greatest but entertaining nonetheless,"A little far fetched and not as well written as his others but I still read this book in just a couple of days because after all Patterson knows how to keep your interest piqued!! I recommend it, but I can see why some of the reviewers were disappointed."
3,It Was Okay....,"The only other book I have read from James Patterson besides this book was ""Kiss The Girls"". I got into that book from the first page but this book just never really grabbed my attention until about two-thirds through it. It was an easy-to-read book with a sort of interesting storyline but I just couldn't really get into the book very much. I'm glad that I stuck with it until the end because I did enjoy the ending but people looking for the fast paced action like in ""Kiss The Girls"" need to look elsewhere."
2,"Fast paced, good start, but fizzles with little substance....","EXTREMELY FASTED PACED AND EASY TO READ, BUT NOT MUCH ELSE. GREAT FOR THE BEACH OR A PLANE"
4,"Interesting, Imaginative story","I think this is my all-time favorite James Patterson book, although a little different than the detective-crime stories that Patterson is well known for. The story evolves mysteriously, at a good pace, and the female lead character is very engaging. I like the short chapter style because I can read for 10 minutes, if that is all I have time for. The type of grammar and vocabulary used in this book is appropriate for the type of science-fiction fantasy novel that it is. It's not rocket science, just an interesting and original story that I have seen other authors try to make their own soon this was published. I have the hard cover and I have read it twice. I have also given it as a gift and it was well received. I recommend it!"
4,GREAT READ! I LOVED IT!,"A total detour from vintage Patterson, and I think that's what makes an author great. The ability to go completely out of the box and write about something totally out of his norm! The plot was a little off the wall, but was very entertaining and out of the ordinary. I couldn't put the book down.Bravo! Patterson gets two thumbs up from me on this one!"
5,When the Wind Blows,"This is the first title by this author that I have read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes, some may find it a bit far fetched but isn't that what fiction is all about? As a veterinarian, I enjoyed the main character and the references to veterinary medicine. This was a book that I found difficult to put down."
1,I could not force myself to finish this book.,I really like James Patterson's works and was surprised by the utterly disappointing plot and premise of When the Wind Blows. For the first time in may years I did not (could not) finish the book - it has gone out with the trash.
1,Doesn't even rate one full star.,"I was truly shocked by how bad this book is. Mr. Patterson evokes no suspense, his characters are one-dimensional, the plot is just plain silly. Perhaps a more talented writer could have done something creative with this premise.The book reads like it was written by a thirteen year old girl for other thirteen year old girls. I suffered through 148 pages hoping the writing would get better, skimmed through a few more pages, and finally decided not to waste any more time trying to be entertained by this piece of trash."
1,"Really bad. Really, really bad.","Okay, here's an example of 'suspense' in this book: As she enters a house she thinks, ""Wait! A trap! But it was too late!"" That closes the chapter. Turn the page and the first line of the next chapter is, ""No, it was not a trap, after all.""I'm not kidding."
1,Absolute junk compared to earlier works,"I cannot belive that the author who wrote great stuff like ""Kiss the Girls"" , ""Cat and Mouse"" and many other good books can write such stupid stuff!. Genetic engineering is not the issue here, but the way Patterson spins this fairy-tale, it is a complete insult to the fans of his work. Unless he writes something on the lines of his earlier works, I am never going to buy or read his future books."
1,A Total Waste of His Time and My Money,"I struggled to finish this book and when I had, I wondered why I bothered. It's like he wrote it in his sleep. There were so many loose ends, it's hard to know where to start. For instance, they got to the army base at 1200 hrs then were supposed to meet the General at 0200 hrs. Oh, Really? They waited until 2.00 am to see a guy when they arrived at noon? Where were the editors when they were needed. The science is far-fetched, I should know, I have 2 degrees in biology. The throw away references to current pop idols and fashions should be left to Stephen King - he does it better. For all the misguided people who thought it was a great book, I have an infinitely better choice - ""The Watchers"" by Dean Koontz. It's more entertaining and in a way, more believable.James Patterson, please go back to Alex Cross - he's much more believable than these 2-dimensional ones in WTWB."
1,This was stupid !,I was so disappointed. The story was like a halucination. Not believeable not consistent and down right dumb.
1,No Effort in Writing It...No Effort in Reading It,"I like James Patterson, but this book was terrible. I read 70 pages (quickly) and finally had enough. Since he put so little effort in writing the book, I felt the same way in reading the book..."
1,Thank God for the Libary,"I have to say this book was terrible. Could not wait to finish it. I have read other books by this author and thought they were very good. Kept you on edge. If it is your first book of Mr. Pattersons please dont make it your last. Try his earlier writings, you wont be dissapointed."
5,WHEN THE WIND BLOWS,"A MUST read, a suspenseful, joyful, sad, maddening, wondrous, and mysterious book, with a ""sprinkling"" of scifi and some bad bits of medical ""philosophy"". This recommendation is a riveting book, you won't want to put down ~ absorbing to the end, and three cheers for the ""flyers""; we all have dreams at one time or another of flying - not by aircraft... no, no, but under the power of our own bodies.The intertwining of characters in WHEN THE WIND BLOWS finds you hating some characters for their cruelty and loving the ones who protect the children. ALSO... don't forget to follow through with the sequel to that 1998 book - ""THE LAKE HOUSE"" published 2003. again you experience suspense, joy, sadness, love, fright, and ""hurray"" emotions all in one.... and another five stars for ""The Lake House"", too.Josephine Anna Kaszuba Locke, Concord, NH; a self-confessed ""biblioholic"", an avid reader..."
4,everyone will like this book,"I have read most of Patterson's books. This one I enjoyed the most, so far. I think because it was the only one to really creap me out. Others were creepy in a I'm reading about a creepy guy kind of thing. This one actually creeped me out while reading in the dark."
5,one of my favorite books ever,"this is definatly new ground for patterson. He usually worte about some of the worst serial kllers. but now he has entered into the sci-fi realm. He succeeded effortlessly.The characters, the plot , the ideas. Powerful. I cannot even begin to discuss the book. I hope it is made into a movie and done properly."
3,Pleasant Read,"In this novel you will find a suspenseful tale of human experimentation, conspiracies, government cover-ups with a dash of romance thrown in. In addition, you will connect with the heroine and end up rooting for her until the very last page. James Patterson has it all neatly packaged for you in When The Wind Blows."
4,Not bad,"This story is far-fetched, but I still enjoyed it. Fast-paced, likable characters, I would recommend this one."
1,Disappointing,"Having read and been thrilled by Kiss the Girls, I couldn't wait to get started with When the Wind Blows. Was that ever a mistake. What a let down from previous works. I, too, hope Mr. Patterson returns to Alex Cross and great mysteries. Leave Sci Fi to Bradbury."
1,This book is for the birds - BRING BACK ALEX CROSS,"What a disappointment! Please - if you have not read ""Along Came A Spider"" & his books through ""Cat & Mouse"". DON'T START WITH THIS ONE! This book lacks the suspense that stimulates natural curiousity and anxiousness when reading one of James Patterson's books. The fictional characters and bland story line leave little to the imagination and allows the reader to predict the ending. Alex Cross & the story lines of serial killers allows the readers imagination to run wild because the plot is of something that happens in todays society and we fear it. You don't know what will happen next. This one is far too predictable and frankly, turning the page is just as satisfying as closing the book. PLEASE BRING BACK ALEX CROSS !!!"
5,Held me captive from the first page to the last!,"I was lucky enough to recieve a pre-release version of this book before its actual publication. This was my first time reading Patterson so I did not know what to expect. Well, it was very entertaining and informative. The existance of an immoral group of scientist experimenting on human beings was not hard to imagine. The bird children were so realistically portrayed that I found myself really caring about the characters and hope that if a race of hybrids are ever discovered that we treat them with the dignity all creatures deserve. I enjoyed this book and recommend it to readers who enjoy: sci-fi, action/adventure, or romance. Great book!"
2,Very Dissapointing,"I have come to appreciate and look forward to the next Alex Cross novel. However, as a change of pace, I figured this story would be a nice diversion. Unfortunately, this story was far too unrealistic unless Mr Patterson is crossing the line to Science Fiction/Fantasy. By far the worst of his extinguished career."
5,You don't want to miss this one!,"Wow, what a surprise I had when I read this new James Patterson book. It is very different for him and I would compare it to the style of Dean Koontz. It is very fast paced and you will not be able to put it down. The character study was great. There is some science fiction, romance, thrills, adventure, humor and a whole mixture of emotions you will go through as you read this. Read it and enjoy!"
4,"Different, but enjoyable....","I enjoyed this novel. It was an easy read and I finished it in just a few days. Though Patterson's Alex Cross novels are my favorite, this novel provided a nice change of pace. I enjoyed the mixture of suspense and childish playfulness. Having winged children as the heroes was a nice touch. I look forward to the next Alex Cross novel."
4,The Pages Flew!,"This is the first book I've read that is written by Patterson and the impression is a good one. I read this in about six hours and couldn't put it down. It's a fast read, exciting, and the ending was definitely a touching one. I actually started crying near the end. But then, I'm a pretty sentimental person. I found the discovery of ""Gillian's"" real identity to be a good twist in the plot. I certainly didn't expect it. Kit's character was a bit shaky, but the plot flowed well and the ""winged- children"" had LIFE in them. If a book can touch somebody's heart as this one does, then it's definitely something."
3,Not up to the Normal Patterson Standards,"This book was thoroughly enjoyable up until the climax. Without going into details that would spoil the plot, what happens when Kit and Frannie are imprisoned is ludicrous--as is how the imprisoning is resolved. The characters lack any real texture, and the relationships are expedient and contrived. This struck me as a deadline product. Please, James, give us the quality we've come to expect in your work."
1,James Patterson Falls on His Face on This One,"When the Wind Blows is the poorest fiction I've read in a long, long time. One can only wonder what causes a good author like Patterson to write a trite, unbelievable, third rate work like this???"
3,Less Than Captivating,"This was the first book I have ever read by James Patterson, and it will probably be my last. It wasn't that the book was horrible, it just seemed like it took forver to finish. Let's just say I wouldn't make any recommendations for this book:}"
2,"If you are looking for Alex Cross, this book won't cut it.","It is difficult for me to ascertain whether it was the story I didn't like or whether I simply missed Alex Cross. As of late too many authors seem to be ""jumping on this bandwagon"" of genetic engineering going haywire coupled with government complicity. The plot was far too predictable. Suffice it to say this is no great work of literature for my taste, but if you just want pure escapism and enjoy Koontz, it rates OK. (And wait until it comes out in paperback.)"
5,Couldn't put it down,"This book kept me going from the start to the end. This might not be the usual Patterson novel, but he still have the skills to keep me wanting more."
1,A real disappointment!,"I bought a copy of this book as soon as I saw it for sale because I've enjoyed all of James Patterson's books in the past. I usually check out customer reviews for new books before I buy them but in this case I didn't feel I needed to because all of his other books have been so good. I don't know how Patterson could have strayed so far with this one, though! It was written as though its reader were a 12-year old. I thought I was reading one of my daughter's ""Babysitter Club"" books. It lacked the depth of character that his other books had. I really don't think that he spent much time writing this book as he obviously should have. I know I'll first check out the reviews before I buy another book by James Patterson."
4,engaging plot; light read; over too quickly,Great plot and characters; not gripping but enjoyable; large type; over too quickly.
1,A major disappointment,"I always look forward to reading a James Patterson novel, gleefully anticipating page after page of suspense. Instead, with ""When the Wind Blows"" all I got was a bunch of unrealistic ramblings pretending to be a novel that I only completed to see if it ever redeemed itself...it did not. Go back to Alex Cross in a hurry."
2,Very disapointing...wanted a scary book. Got a silly book,"After reading about the villians like Gary Soneji, I was certainly expecting a book that would raise the hairs on my neck. This book was silly, and did nothing to capture my interest, or even make me care (as it intended to)"
4,ENTHRALLING READ,"This was my first read by Patterson, and everyone says the Alex Cross books are better; however, I thought this was a good read--highly unbelievable story, but captivating nonetheless...Would make an excellent film"
1,"Shallow Entertainment, and Oh So Sloppy!","Totally unbelievable, but not because of the sci-fi premise. So many plot flaws, such poor editing: In Chapter 105 (Chapter 105!!), how does Max know about events that she was not witness to? Why do Kit and Frannie take such stupid risks in the 2nd half of the book, and can anyone believe the ""auction"" scene? Dozens more, but I don't want to spoil the plot for those who haven't read it. Also, shouldn't Mr. Patterson (or one of his editors, if they had read the book) know that 2pm is 1400 hours military time, not 0200 hours? I wonder if it's true that much of this book was ghost written?"
1,Not Worth It!,"I was very disappointed in this book. It had potential but just fizzled out. I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did. Take a pass on this one."
5,Loved this book. Couldn't put it down. How different!,"I love James Patterson's books. The story was so different. Ending was good but not sappy. It's hard to write much more than that without giving away the story. I wish, though, a little more was said about the ""School"" and what was being done. Would like to see a sequel to this with ""continuing adventures of Max and Matthew""."
3,Interesting story,"I thought this book was an easy read. The chapters were short and interesting.James Patterson did a good job of telling this story about genetic altering of humans, but he did leave me hanging a few times. I did not understand how Kit first became involved through the FBI with this case; nor, did I understand why the various doctors were killed. That part of the plot didn't make a lot of sense. Why was the lab left totally unattended and open with the geneticlaly altered children alive? These children could also fly and they were later selling the children to the highest bidders.Again, I liked the book, because I liked the fantasy and the happy ending."
2,A last resort when you can't sleep on an airplane,"This was my first, and last, James Patterson novel. Why? 1) Formulaic writing that reads like a first effort following an ""Intro to Fictional Writing"" seminar. 2) Awkward, self-consciously placed pop culture references. 3) Heavy-handed emotional manipulation. 4) Inexplicable switching between 1st- and 3rd-person narration.Lament the fact that this book is the #1 paperback and find something good to read."
2,NOT ANYTHING LIKE ALEX CROSS,"This book is not at all like Alex Cross books. It is fairly boring and too much fantasy. If you like sci-fi or fantasy books then you'd like this, if not don't read this. Save your money for Alex Cross books."
3,Page turner with a bit wierdness to it,"I thought this book was very interesting and was definently a page turner, but the plot was a little too strange and the way sex was thrown into the story was very awkward considering all the events that were taking place. I would recommend this book though, I like the way the author wrote it, with short chapters."
1,Not very good. Not very good at all.,"When the Wind Blows is very forgettable, a very weak offering from someone who should know better. Patterson has given me no choice but to advise you to skip this book and read a REAL novel instead. There are a lot of them out there this summer. I liked ""Stones From the River"", ""Point of Origin"", and especially the new WWII novel, ""The Triumph and the Glory""."
3,GOOD BEACH READING,"I read this book while sitting in a pool at a water park watching my kids play when it was 100 degrees outside. Just the perfect type of book for summer relaxing - an easy read, short chapters, simple to follow. I liked it for what it was - entertaining, thought-provoking (could something like this really be done in genetic engineering?), and a little romantic. I fell in love with the flying kids and imagined what it would be like to FLY. Give Patterson a break - I think he accomplished what he intended to do with this book."
2,I want my money back!,I regret the day I bought this book. I wish I knew where the author lives to get a refund. I am very dissappointed with Mr. Patterson ever writing this book. The plot is very elementary for his usual readers and the story is surreal. The main characters are children who were genetically engineered to be great human species and have special powers. It's a dumb book to waste time and effort to read. You can do better than this James Patterson!
3,Realistic Evaluation,"Reading the reveiws of this book, I find that far to often, and especially so in this case, the reviews are skewed so severely because of an emotional need by some people to build up or blast a work far beyond what is appropriate or even accurate. This book was well written, but the premise is definitely far fetched. In my opinion, a term that should be used more often by reviewers, this is an average book written by an auther with an exceptional list of works, and therefore in a relative sense this book is a dissappointment, but not so much of one that it would deserve less than 2 or 3 stars."
1,Didn't Finish It,"I was dusting this weekend and found this book under a pile of papers -- and realized I'd never gotten around to finishing it. The writing was amateurish and the characters were cartoons. The winged girl was supposed to be unusually intelligent and yet this was not demonstrated in any way I could see. From reading other reviews I understand that this book is an extreme departure for Patterson and that a lot of his fans are deeply devoted, normally. I couldn't stand this book and yet, ironically, I'm now planning to pick up another Patterson novel to see who this beloved ""Alex Cross"" is who inspires such loyalty!"
4,great,"I love james patterson, and his old writing is great. I had read the maximum ride series and wanted to see where they all started, and was not dissapointed."
1,Forgive And forget..Start over again,"My time is very valuble to me, so i am quite selective with the authors i choose to read. And while i have read all of Pattersons work, and am probably his biggest fan, everybody at one time or another makes a mistake. Patterson deserves the forgiveness from all of us, who are his loyal readers.This was not even close to being good. My only concern is for any new readers who may have recently started with Patterson. Whos going to notify them and tell them,"" he went astray on this one""...."
1,I want my money back!!!,"This is by far, the worst book I have ready in many years. I did not know that Patterson wrote ""science fiction"". Save your money!"
1,If there was less than one star I would give it to this book,"I have recently become more selective in buying books, but James Patterson was an author whose novels I enjoyed and would like to have in my library. I was discussing his new book in the library and it was suggested to me to read the library copy first before buying. The better suggestion would have been to not waste my time. What happens to all these authors who write such entertaining novels? Why do they feel they have to change such a successful procedure for something new. When the winds blow is terrible. Take my suggestion. Do not bother to read."
1,A MAJOR disappointment!!,I have grown used to Patterson's taut plots and interesting characters. Imagine my dismay when I read this AWFUL book. I will be reluctant to pick up the next Alex Cross novel because it appears as if Patterson has become a sellout.
1,This book was horrible,"Like many other readers, I was lured into reading this with the hope that this would be another in the fantastic Alex Cross series. However, this book tunred out to be a poorly written sci-fi book with some of the worst characters, and one of the worst plots, that I have ever tried to read. I gave up after page 150 and just read the last 30 pages to see what would happen. Believe me folks, don't waste your money on this. Mr. Patterson should go back to writing Alex Cross literary success. Not this drivel.thrillers. Those books are what made him a success. Not this drivel."
3,A quick fun read,"This is a quick and easy read that is entertaining. I stayed up reading until I finished it...it's that kind of book. However, the overall plot is sort of cheesy. When you think about it when your done reading it, you think, ""that was stupid."" But it does get your attention and involve the reader to a certain extent."
1,"weak, expected, lame dialogue",Disappointing. I expected so much more from Patterson. I found the dialogue to be immature. I previously enjoyed his other books Patterson took one idea (it should have been a short story) and went nowhere with it.
2,A great disappointment.,"This story was so far from any reality, that it was hard to stay with it. I love a science fiction angle, but it's nice if some threads can be drawn to reality to make the premise seem plausible. The style of writing, also, did not resemble the previous books by this author, books which I greatly enjoyed. Frankly, it read as if a contract were being fulfilled, and much was done by ghost-writers. Sorry, but this one's not for me."
1,Not worth the time it took to read it!,"I kept waiting for something to happen to bring me into the story. It never did. This was a farfetched bunch of hooey in my opinion. At least when Mr. Patterson is writing about serial killers and Dr Alex Cross, the characters are believable. Even if the Government or private companies are genetically engineering children into birds, I don't care to read about it. Please bring back Dr. Cross."
1,It's hard to believe this is a Patterson,"Not what I have grown to expect by Patterson. Not a bad nights read but certainly out of character. When you wait and wait for a Patterson and get this I can't help but feel let down. But I give him credit for treading new ground, just do it under a surname."
2,"I wanted to like this book, but just couldn't get there.","I really enjoyed Patterson's other books, and was ready for lead characters other than Alex Cross. I've been a big Stephen King fan at times - he lost me during the ""Insomnia"" years but has gotten me back with ""Green Mile"" and ""Bag of Bones"" - so I can suspend my disbelief long enough to buy into the idea of a bird-girl. All the parts of the puzzle were there for me - Patterson just never put them together. It's like he connected all the easy edge pieces (the ones with straight sides) and left everything else in the middle just sitting there. I was left feeling that this book is too thin. The characters have no depth; key scenes went by much too fast and with too little detail; even the epilogue was flat. Its OK for Patterson to move from suspense to science fiction, but in his effort to write compelling science, he forgot to give us good fiction."
3,really mixed feelings,"Talk about mixed feelings! When I started reading this book (doesn't the cover look inviting) I really didn't know what to think - at first I couldn't believe that this was written by James Patterson - such a departure from his other novels. But I must say that after reading the first couple of chapters I did get a feeling for the characters and at the end did enjoy the book. Can't wait until his next one - where he promises to bring ""Cross"" back!"
1,extremely disappointing - go back to Alex Cross,"Judging from the reviews, you either love this book or hate it. I hated it. I never accepted the premise -- winged children????? But on top of that, there were just too many holes -- at the end, they just went off & lived happily ever after??? Come on ......."
2,not up to expectations,"Hello, I have read this book and I am quite disappointed. True, it is quite interesting and somewhat a departure for the author, but it just doesn't ""grab"" you like his other books. Basically, the book is about a scientific experiment conducted that has left two children with wings. A manhunt is conducted in order to ""put these two children to sleep"" and somehow, a vet (who is also dealing with her own personal tragedy) stumbles upon this whole issue as well. My personal opinion is that the author tries too hard to grab the attention of the reader, at the expense of the plot. It is not a bad book, just something which falls way short of expectations. I would still recommend ""Kiss the girls"" as the best book by the author and would rather give ""When the wind blows"" a miss."
2,Bring back Alex Cross,"I too was also very disappointed in this book. I love James Patterson's books and was expecting something along the line of his previous stuff. This was very far fetched and when I finally put the book down, I was angry I had spent money on the book. I love being able to get into the characters and this was just to unrealistic for that to happen. Let's hope his next book gets back to his ""sit on the edge of your seat"" reading"
2,First time reader not impressed.,"I got an advance reading copy of this book and began reading it almost immidiately; I had never read his work but had heard wonderful things about him. I was pretty disappointed but stuck with it all the way through as sometimes books tend to pick up at the end. But despite the occasional interesting couple of 2-page chapters, this book was a chore to finish and I'm a big fan of sci-fi; i got it a month before it was released and didn't finish it until long after it was on the shelves. With this being my first impression of James Patterson, I won't be jumping to read any of his others in the near future."
2,"FAST PACED, GOOD START, BUT FIZZLES WITH LITTLE SUBSTANCE!","EXTREMELY FASTED PACED AND EASY TO READ, BUT NOT MUCH ELSE. GREAT FOR THE BEACH OR A PLANE."
2,A Waste of Money,"When I purchase a book I like to be entertained. I am usually a fan of Patterson's work, but this book was a big disappointment. I finished the book in just a few hours over two days. I guess it was entertaining enough, but the depth in this book just wasn't there...as it has been in his previous novels. It seemed to be written for another type of audience, maybe ten-year-olds?"
1,A VERY DISAPPOINTING BOOK.,I REALLY WISH I COULD SAY I ENJOYED THIS BOOK EVEN A LITTLE. IT IS A BOOK WHICH HAS VERY LITTLE ENTHUSIASM AND DOES NOT GET TO THE POINT OR ENDING IN ANY SPECIFIC PATTERN. I HAVE BEEN AN AVID FAN FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS. GO BACK TO ALEX CROSS IMMEDIATELY DO NOT PASS GO DO NOT COLLECT $200.00. ALEX COME HOME//////////
1,Big Disappointment!,"If I learned anything from reading this novel, it's that I should read these reviews before making any more purchases! I am a huge fan of Alex Cross, and when I heard that there was a new Patterson novel out, I automatically bought it without even reading the jacket notes. Because the nursery rhyme title is so similar to the Cross series, I expected a Cross story! But boy was I disappointed. This story is just too.... simple. I can't believe that it was written by the same person, and it seems as though a lot of other readers feel the same way. In the future, I will be sure to read the reviews before buying any other books."
1,Some of the worst writing I've ever read.,"Putting aside the stupid plot line and the amateurish characterization, this is some of the worst writing I've ever read. If James Patterson hadn't written this, it would have never been published. He should be embarrassed to have his name on the front of the book."
2,What a disappointment!,"James Patterson is capable of writing so much more believable novels. I've read all he's written and this is the biggest disappointment - too unbelievable. If you have other books to read, put this one on the BOTTOM of the stack!"
1,What dreck!,How did the publisher let Patterson get away with marketing this one for adults? This book is such a waste of time!!! I may hand it over to my 7 year old nephew to teach him how to read - while teaching him how NOT to write a bad novel...
1,"STUPID, SILLY BORING",This book had the possibity to be good. But I got turned off immediately when the ANTI-HUNTING lingo started. Then it just got worse and sillier. I think I will move on to other authors.
1,"Very Disappointing, Don't waste your time with this one","I am a huge James Patterson fan and was eager to read his latest. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem as if James Patterson wrote this book at all. The characters are all flat, text is redundant (how many times do we need to read about the feeling of flying?) and the plot pretty predictable. Very unlike Patterson's other books, with Alex Cross a very real, multi-dimensional character. I guess I will stick to Patterson's Alex Cross books in the future."
1,"If this is what commercial fiction is becoming, kill me now.","This was one of the most idiotic, worst written novels I've ever read. I'm not against fantastic plots, providing the characters and language rise to the challenge of making the fantastic believable, which is certainly not the case here. The characters are cliches. The language wouldn't dazzle a nine-year-old. Even the sex scenes are uninspired. Patterson couldn't have spent more than two weeks writing this. Hopefully he was paid enough to retire and make room for someone with skill and respect for his audience."
3,Had me interested,"A fan of the authors series with Alex Cross, I tried this one and enjoyed it. Flying girl? Kind of hard to believe. But that combined with the trials and tribulations of Frannie and Tom Brennan, make for an interesting read. The School people, the Doctors, Frannies so called friends, all play a role. Tom, let down before by the Bureau, is on his own here. With the help of Frannie, Max and the others school kids they come out in decent shape. Mr. Patterson had me going during this one. Give it a shot."
2,The wind was weak,"I think James Patterson is a great writer, however, I found this book to be a bit below expectation. Although Patterson found a way to tell this story of genetic alteration and a possible governemet cover-up, the story itself was a bit too far fetched. I did find that his research made the story more believiable, however, all the medical research books in the world could not have made me want to continue reading this story. I did finish it and while I was disappointed with the conclusion, it was understandable to me why he ended it the way he did. To sum up may feelings for the book, I am going to have to give it a thumbs down and not encourage a Patterson groupie like myself to read it."
1,Winged Children - Give Me a Break,"This book was among the worst I've read in a long time. I cannot for the life of me figure out why I finished this one. I guess I had hoped it would get better. But it didn't. The plot was predictable; the writing elementary; and if this was supposed to be a medical thriller, it missed the mark completely."
1,One of the genre's worst written books,"James Patterson has come up with some decent plots before, but both the plot and the writing in When the Wind Blows are unbearable. A government scheme to create kids who can fly sounds like a bad X-files episode, but the writing is downright atroicious. More than 100 chapters of 1 or 2 pages each, multiple points of view, and some of the stupidest scenarios you could ever see in a horror book. Patterson obviously wanted to come up with a plot that's similar to John Saul's works, but he doesn't pull it off with anywhere near the finesse that Saul does (most of the time.) Complete garbage."
3,Action Packed,"Frannie is a young veterinarian whose husband was recently murdered. She meets Kit, a troubled FBI agent who lost his family in a tragic airplane crash. Whilst walking in the forest, Frannie makes the most unforgettable discovery. She glimpses, through the trees, an 11 year old girl, Max, who has the wings of a bird. Max and her brother escape the scientific laboratories where they were created and then flee into the woods. And so begins the nervous tension and unfolding of a story of deceiving, secrets and man creating new species by combining the old.I am the first to admit that I am not a big fan of James Patterson, but I genuinely enjoyed this story. It read quickly and easily and I am certain all Young Adult readers will enjoy this story as well (if they have not read it already). The story was action packed which kept the pages turning."
4,Good Read,It was definitely different but it was a good read. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I already have The Lake House that I will start on to see what happens next.
1,Garbage Is Too Nice A Word For This One!,"I wouldn't have liked this even at age 8. I like things that are at least remotely possible. (Tom Sawyer - Huck Finn ?) Or well written, definite fantasy such as Grimm's/Andersen's fairy tales - Wizard of Oz - Alice in Wonderland, et al.When The Wind Blows fails on all counts. It is unforgiveably poorly written as well as being inferior fantasy. Those of you who would have given Patterson no stars, if available, are much too generous. I'm holding out for negative stars.Like the majority of fans of Patterson's, I enjoy his Alex Cross books, as well as The Women's Murder Club books. His other novels, such as The Thomas Berryman Number are O.K. He should stick to what he knows and leave the fantasy to those who are good at it."
2,"Interesting premise, poor delivery.","This book suffers from a lot of problems. Poor dialogue, stunted chapters and 1 dimensional characters. This is all too bad because it started with a good idea. The thought of genetic experimentation with the grafting of animals and humans is very cool. Mr. Patterson could have done a better job with this book and its sequel, Lake House. Yes, I read it in hopes that he would rescue the premise. He didn't. I was even dumb enough to read the tween novel Maximum Ride. I don't reccomend any of the three."
4,Light read,"This particular tome in the James Patterson library is a quick sci-fi romp through the mountains of Colorado. It was enjoyable, even if its premise is silly. I thought the characters were what sold this one rather than all of the crazy stuff going on around them. I almost think I liked Maximum Ride more."
3,Good vs. Evil,"I love good vs. evil stories except for one thing, they are always predictable. It's not that I want to see the bad guys win, I just wish someone would be creative enough to find a new way to get there. Patterson is a great writer, can hold your interest and make bizarre things seem believable, but the plot, as good as it gets, just doesnt' have a lot to it. I still would recommend it as a good read!"
1,Awful,"So horribly bad, I don't want to waste time with a long review. This is the worst book I've ever read, except for One-Way Propeller Night Coach by John Travolta. And it was close.Seriously, this is a book for a child or a simpleton. It's boring, silly, grating, nauseating, and literally impossible in about 15 different ways. Worst of all, there's now a sequel!Hint for Patterson -- An 80lb girl would need a wingspan of 20 feet wide minimum to fly (and she would look more like a giant deformed bird than a human). Couldn't quite fly down a hallway in a house, could she?"
1,Will read reviews from now on out.,"I have read over a dozen JP novels over the years and have never been disappointed until now.I read ""Jester"", another fantasy co-written with Andrew Gross a while back, but I thoroughly loved that one. But this one is a very predictable childish fairytale that belongs on Saturday morning TV. How disappointing!I will never blindly pick up a Patterson novel again without a little research."
3,"Good, but not good enough for James Patterson...","When the Wind Blows was a bit of a disappointment for me. Although James Patterson's description throughout the novel was excellent, I felt the characters were badly developed and the chapters were much too short. The short chapters made me feel as though I was being bounced around between two entirely different plot lines and after reading the entire novel like that, I began to get a headache. The book wasn't believable enough and I couldn't connect or relate to the novel. I felt lost. The only other book that I have read by James Patterson, was Black Market and I enjoyed that novel and that is why I tried to give When the Wind Blows a fair chance and I feel three stars is a more than fair rating for this slightly entertaining but still disappointing James Patterson novel."
4,Good read but diiferent from his usual.,"I have read Patterson since way before Kiss the Girls became popular with the movie several years ago. This book is very different from the ones which star Alex Cross, but that does not make it bad. Patterson fans should enjoy this one even though it more of a medical thriller than a murder mystery thriller. I applaud him for his efforts to diversify his works but I also encourage him to go back to Alex Cross (more out of enthusiam for the character not criticism for this particular work)."
1,I Gave It 1 Star Because there is nothing lower.,What a waste of time. This really put a bad taste in my mouth for Patterson. I read Kiss the Girls and it held my interest - not great but good enough to make me try another of his. But no more. This was plain irritating.
3,"Idea is ok, but application isn't that good!","We should confess that the initial idea-that of mutated children with wings- is a brilliant one but author should explain scientific basis for his idea! We have no clue how this process can happen genetically, this puts the story in x-files league, a complete fantasy. I agree with the other reviewers that Patterson has portrayed the characters poorly and it takes a lot from the novel. The epilogue is a failure as well, it contradicts the rest of the story! This was the first Patterson book i read, i doubt i will read another book of him again"
2,A strange disappointment,"I'm a big Patterson fan and was extremely disappointed with When the Wind Blows, although I did get through it very quickly. I found the premise too creepy to start with. And the ending totally simplistic. After 400 pages of not trusting anyone Kit & Frannie go for the ""Happily ever after ending"" A bit far fetched. I wish Patterson would bring Alex Cross & family back again."
3,Average,"This is a thriller that doesn't thrill and an adventure book that doesn't quite let the reader suspend disbelief. I like Patterson's early crime books but he's just spread a little too thin right now and it feels like assembly-line, piecework writing. This book will get you through it but won't leave you with any real feeling for it."
5,When the wind blows,"Well I read the book ""When the wind blows"", and surprisingly I liked it. I read a lot of James Patterson's books and I love them all I totally didn't expect this one not even a hint of what it was about, But it grabbed my attention and kept it. What a pleasant surprise it seemed so out of character for James Patterson but aren't we all out of character sometimes that's what makes us interesting."
3,OK read,"The premise was good, and some of the chapters were well-written. But some of the other chapters left a lot to be desired, and sloppily written. It seems to be a trait in all of Mr. Patterson's books (at least those I have read) in varying degrees.I will say one thing - this book was way better than the Maximum Ride novel I read the other day. I had actually read Maximum Ride before this, but enjoyed this book better. This book could have been improved by putting in more detail and fleshing out the plot - many questions are left unanswered. I don't know if I'll pick up a copy of 'Lake House'."
1,Bah Humbug!,I'm tired of writers playing fast and loose with science. This is science fiction at it's worst and a total waste of time.James Patterson should stick to what he does best---detective stories.
1,Awful is all I can say,"I was checking out a Maximum Ride book for my daughter and I read that the character was inspired by Max, a girl with wings from When the Wind Blows. It sounded interesting so I picked it up now I wished I hadn't. The characters are so one dimensional, the descriptions are repeated over and over, and the book drags on way too long. I couldn't stand it anymore and just jumped ahead to the end and I didn't miss a thing."
3,An OK Novel,"This novel i had very high hopes for when i first picked it up. I glanced on the black and was hooked from the intresting story line of a girl with super powers. For the first 1/3 of the book i was captivated. The story of this young girl escaping was fresh and exciting. But as the novel went on, i couldn't help but feel as though the story was just repeating himself. The character's would almost get caught, then they escape again. Characters almost get caught, then they escape again. This is the first novel of his where i felt bored at some parts of the book. usually with his novels i am enthralled the entire time through but this one fell short. Despite all of this repeativness i really did enjoy the asountouding twist at the end of the novel where frannie finds people she is not expecting. The human connection between her and Kit seem to be personal and believable. Overall only a 3 star. Worth a read"
1,Not the James Patterson book I wanted to read.,I got a advance readers copy and I was very disappointed. I'm glad I didn't buy this book because a James Patterson book is always on my list and this book is nothing like any of his previous books or anything I would read. I have alot of trouble getting into a book where a bird girl is the main character. Frannie and Kit seemed a afterthought and I found both of them boring.
1,A major disappointment,"I am a huge James Patterson fan, but I have to admit that this one was a true disappointment. From the first page, I could not connect with any of these characters but I continued to read, hoping to develop some interest in them. No thrills or major surprises throughout. I do admire his courage to try something different, but I think he should stick to what he does best."
1,"Oh, James, James, James.... Very, very poor......","Being a Patterson fan for many years, all I can say is what a major disappointment. Why authors are allowed to write such dribble on the back of one's success, I'll never ever understand... If I have to pay approx. $25 dollars for classics like ""Kiss the Girls"", ""Jack & Jill"", and ""Cat & Mouse"", then this book is worth $1.99, (if even that).If you do have to go out and buy this book, which you probably will if you have read previous books by James Patterson... Wait until the paperback comes out, and feed it to the nearest goat....."
2,a reach,"Okay maybe I don't like science fiction. Which is what this was to me. Kids that can fly....whatever. I know sometimes James Patterson goes out of the crime/mystery that's normal for him. i.e. Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas (which I loved), but this one was just too wierd for me. I was never sold on his world in this book. One good thing is that I read it really fast."
3,When the wind blows,When I saw the television show on fox Dark Angel I knew that I had heard of the story line before and am so glad that I have found the book. I have looked all over for this book and this time I am going to buy the book so I can read it again and again. If you found the book luke-warm watch the series on television it is soo good. If you watch the show read the book so much more in the show will make sense.
2,Not worth the time.,"I've read nearly all of James Patterson's books and this was the most dissappointing. His others like Jack and Jill, Hide and Seek and Kiss the Girls were a whloe lot better.The word that comes to mind when describing this book is FLUFF. Also, maybe I am too picky but I hate finding gross errors in novels-even if they are fiction. Sorry I don't have the book in front of me to give a page reference, but did it bother anyone else when the book wrapped up in a meeting at 0200 hours on the lawn. That's 2:00 in the morning-not 2:00 in the afternoon!!! And it was very apparent the meeting wasn't being held in the dark!"
4,I loved it!,"I don't read many books at all, but I loved this one! I am a big fan of his also! When I find an author I like I tend to read all their books!"
4,Give It A Chance,"I don't know why there are so many people are ragging this book and the author. I have not ever read James Patterson so maybe this might not be up to his normal standards but this book is great. I took a real chance getting a hardback book by an author I have never read. I was delighted with the outcome. I am going to go back now and start on his other books. Really people, this book is very entertaining and exciting. It's a great read!!!"
2,Disappointing for James Patterson's fans!,"Just finished reading Patterson's newest book and , like others, was very disappointed in this read. I love James Patterson's novels but this one definitely did not compare to past books. I do believe that there may be experiments taking place that we know nothing about..but, really, a human with wings....and bird-like organs...who lays eggs...really...James...give us a break!"
1,It's not only the wind that blows,"I'm sorry. I like James Patterson novels, that is until I met this one. Mr. Patterson must have written this as his first book and put it away for a rainy day. The diagloge was sophmoric at best, the plot simple and predictable, the characters forgettable. Let's hope Mr. Patterson's next book is back to his orginal style."
3,Good book with a weak ending!,"""The pages fly."" This is a quote from the book jacket. I think it is a fair assessment. I loved Max. Fannie was someone I would have liked for a friend. I thought Kit was the ""knight in shinning armor"". The winged children pulled at my heartstrings and made me laugh with their spunk and directness. The villians possessed all the ""right"" qualities. I hated them. I also hated the ending."
4,Very Different,"I read the reviews before I read it. Most of the reviews were negative. Well I have to disagree....yes it was fantasy....maybe not....who knows what the government conceals to the American public.....this could be happening....At first I was waiting for Alex Cross to come into the book...of course he never does. Yes this was different...I enjoyed it very much....fast reading....James Patterson's other novels were starting to get a little too gory for me. I took a chance on this one, and happy I did."
2,So what is the point,"I was disappointed. The book seemed to have so much promise, but when I finished it, I wasn't sure what I had gained. The ending was rushed, and incomplete. The villans were easy to spot, the ending predictable. I expected so much more, given the storyline. Character development was minimal. How could this be on the best seller list?"
4,"With an imagination, you can go anywhere....","Another page turner from Patterson. Although I missed Alex Cross, I needed a break from him and Soneji... I'm an RN, and having a medical background, reading this book brings to light what really may be happening behind closed doors. Gene and reproductive manipulation...it can be, can't it?, it's incredible scary. I just wished Patterson continued a little with Kit and Frannie...in the end, are they married, do they keep one of the ""ANGELS"", or what? All in all, James did it again, when's the next one coming out?"
4,"Great puzzle, unfortunately not interest my child","I really like this puzzle. It's well built, and it has high educational value. Unfortunately my 3 year old daughter wasn't excited about it. She's not interested in puzzles in general...maybe that's the problem. I only give it 4 stars because it didn't work for my daughter. Otherwise I think it's a very good quality puzzle..."
5,Educational and well made,"A great way to get your little one to encourage letter and sound recognition, as well as counting and recognizing numbers. Very educational and fun for the little ones. My 2 1/2 year old son had a hard time staying engaged for the whole alphabet, but I could see how this would be great for a 3 year old."
4,Eeboo Alphabet & Number Puzzle,I got this for my 3 year old nephew for Christmas and he immediately started playing with. The concept was pretty easy to grasp which made it even more enjoyable for him.
2,Don't Be Fooled!!,"If you're looking for a film adaptation of the novel ""The Story of O"", you won't get it here.What you'll get is a fairly boring soft core movie with a bit of badly done kink at the end. It's also subtitled... including very useful translations of ""Ah! Ah! Ah!"".If you're looking for ""The Story of O"", buy the 1975 version or try to track down a copy of the 1992 ""The Story of O, the Series"". Don't waste your money on this one."
1,The Sexual Story of O,well photographed in some slutty french seaside city but has nothing to do with the original story of o. bad buy If I had known in advance I would not have bought this item
1,Not what it seems.,The box is the only good thing about this movie. The title has nothing to do with the plot of the movie. When you expect one kind of plot and get a completly different plot makes the movie suck big time.
1,The Sexual Story of O,"This story had nothing to do with the original story of ""O"". It was a foreign film with sub titles,poor acting and a bad story line."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! IT'S 'NOT',"Other reviewers are correct. If you're thinking that this is the original cult classic, ""The Story of O"", it isn't! And 'far' from it! Wish I would have known this before I purchased it!Despite the cover image appearing to be that of the original, and [...]And despite the original being a French made movie, unless you can understand Spanish, be perpared to 'read' this movie instead of watching it! That's right, it's all in 'Spanish', with optional English subtitles![...]"
4,More of George's Xcellent early work,"Another Xcellent collection of Martin's early short stories. ""This Tower of Ashes"" was George's choice 4 his best short story, 1nce upon a time; U may agree with him; it's very vivid & very moving. ""The Lonely Songs of Laren Door"" also has that wonderful, moody, romantic atmosphere of so much of George's early work. ""Men of Graywater Station"" (written with Howard Waldrop) is an above-average space thriller. ""Night Shift"" shows the flip-side of Martin's moody/romantic visions -- it's a very gritty, down-2-earth story about working on a future loading dock, comparing spaceships 2 long-distance trucking; definitely something different 4 George; U'll like it. ""For a Single Yesterday"" was also a personal favorite of George's, but 4 me it just misses; it Cms dry, nothing special. ""And Seven Times Never Kill Man"" is a routine space adventure. A couple others R merely average, nothing 2 get Xcited about. But the best stuff here is some of George's best work."
5,Living Landscapes California Redwoods,Very Beautiful footage. I love the slow relaxing pace of the show. I can't wait to see it in HD or Blu Ray
1,Slickness - means you got ripped-off with a horrable attempt at an album,"Title says it all, my last review was deleted, so... thought I'd be short with this one. If the others like this album so much; anyone wanna buy my $20 LP off of me? I pitty the wax that has to exist with this printed on it."
5,Need Columbia Tide Sandal II in size 8,"I love these shoes, unfortunately, I've worn out two pair and I can't find my size 8 any where........you have'm, I'll buy em!"
3,Well-priced,"Sandal is well-stitched and durable, but fits large and is extremely lightweight. Worth the price!"
3,Columbia Sportswear surf tide sandal,This product was true to advertising. Seems to be true to sz and comfortable for all day wear.I thought I ordered in time to take them on their first vacation but they arrived a day late.Still plenty of warm weather ahead so I will get a bit of wear.
2,Straps hurt,"Straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro, they are too short. I tried to add velcro, but that didn't work. I had to give the shoes away. The strap rubbed across the top of the ankle and on the side of the foot and were very uncomfortable. Would not recommend if you are on the heavy side."
5,The greatest anima movie ever,"A good movie with great charters, plot line and a cool story even though i have not seen part 1 and 2 I have seen the movie and it's so cool I would recamend it to anyone except it's rated tv14. Even though I don't know what happend befor I cought on quickly."
5,Love these classics,"I love this movie, really appreciated that the vendor sent it in perfect condition, even for a used item. I received it in 3 days from ordering. So I was pleasantly suprised by this order, since I have been burned in the past by Amazon before. This movie is fun, and funny."
3,One of the most unusual sounds I have heard,I was stunned by this album. It brings together a breadth of artisty I have not seen since the Gotenburg music festival of 1989.
5,Great Disc,Just three words to describe this album/release by Kiya Heartwood and Miriam Davidson: BUY THIS CD!!
3,"OK, but I wouldn't watch it more than once!","Snoop fans might want to pick this one up just to say they own it. The girls were pretty nice, but the DVD was extremely frustrating because there was no Chapter Select! If you watched half of the DVD, the next time you wanted to see it, you would have to fast foward to the part you didn't see. My rating, 50% good content and 50% waiting for the good content!"
3,Bus Tour Blues,Nice music and documented Human Resource preparation to Snoop Dog Bus Tour round the States as extras include simply erotic extension of sexualised enough scenes mush less impressive thanSnoop Dogg's Doggystyleis.
5,Tommy Boy's Greatest Hits,It was just the CD I was looking for with all the old break dance hits. I searched the web over and could not find it (...)I finally came across it and the Tommy Boy Megamix sweetened the deal. Thank you.
4,Early digital vs direct to disc,"I have both the CD and the vinyl with the Bach part of the program. The vinyl clearly mops the floor with the CD. It has more powerful bass, clearer highs and is (strangely) even more dynamic. While digital recording has definitely improved since this was originally recorded, if you want the highest fidelity available for this recording seek out the d to d version. Simply amazing."
1,Not worth the time spent reading it.,"The book is honestly a disgrace. I have to admit, there are some funny pages, hilarious perhaps only to those who have lived similarly cultural shocks between Egypt and the US. But the rest of the book is pure trash. It is also a shame that the author after spending 2 years in Egypt have failed to see many of the nice things in Egypt, and to be more respectful of Islam, especially that it was very evident that she had very little knowledge about it.Also, because of my personal knowledge of certain events/characters in this book, I can totally say that E.G. lacks being observant and analytical in her view of Egypt.If you want to waste away time and money, go ahead and read it, but otherwise...avoid it better"
3,Fletching feathers,"The size was very uniform, however the flat part was not always flat and sometimes after they were mounted, the feather tilted. I made my own arrowheads and shafts so the following part may be my fault... Anyhow, when I shot the arrows, [23 in total] about two of them slivered from the front and lodged in my skin between the thumb and finger. Also there was a small rash that developed after the first of four shooting rounds...probably because I was not wearing a shooting glove. All in all I was happy with the performance, and when I was finished shooting, a quick run between my thumb and finger realigned the vanes. What I enjoyed more than anything was testing my self made Maple bow and Dogwood bow, both of which could use some perfecting...Happy shooting!"
1,real......not a good movie......,"i don't think these guy know the meaning of the word editing..it gos on,and on,and on..and thought it all your think..did i really buy this piece of garbage..bad acting,bad story,bad ghost,(funny this would usely be right up my ally)..look if you really want to see this movie..you can buy mine..opps sorry i just remembered,the dog ate it and threw up..."
3,Spooky,"Just in time for Halloween, this three disc set of DVDs explores three spooky tales of ghosts who have been haunting England for years. The interviews add to the drama and enhance the fright factor lurking in nearly every scene. It's safe to say that anyone with a curiosity about ghosts or supernatural beings will thoroughly enjoy this documentary. I have to warn you though, some of the accounts and stories are a little chilling and there is a lot to listen to. Depending on where you stand on the existence of ghosts, the interviews seemed convincing enough to at least make you consider the possibility that ghosts are around. The three disc set is broken down into three different stories so you won't have to watch the whole set at once to avoid being left in suspense. It's not the ideal movie watching experience for anyone who is easily freaked out by the possibility of ghosts."
4,"Telephone Love, I finally found you","I purchased this album exclusively for the song, Telephone Love. I heard it a while back and loved it, but could not find anyone that could tell me the name of the singer. Shabba Ranks made a remake, but it's nowhere near as good as this version. JC Lodge, you rock!"
5,CD (x2) of Grafin Mariza,I saw a live production outside Vienna 25 years ago . This production is excellent and brings back all the memories of the show I saw.
5,Great fun for 4 and up,"This is the first card game I introduced to my son at age 4. It is a great first card game for kids. We play a few hands with him before bedtime and it is a perfect way for him to wind down before bed. The cards are very cute with fruit/veggie faces, bright colors, and thick paper."
4,Fascinating line through history,"The authors set out to answer a few deceptively simple questions about the organisation they belong to: the Freemasons. In researching answers to satisfy their curiosity, they discover an astounding array of facts, interesting possibilities and historical anomalies. The line they draw through history, running from the ancient Sumerians to the present day, with Egypt, Moses, Jesus, the Rosslyn Chapel and the discovery of America as stations along the way, reinterpret a lot of material seen as basic facts in the Western paradigm. They write passionately, often with quite personal touches, and argue comprehensively. Their influence may be limited by people's intellectual inertia, but their views should be considered."
2,Disclaimer. These stats are unofficial. This is NOT good.,"Mathematics and Statistics are and will always be very important to me. For STATS to have a disclaimer about their books, all 380 pages, being filled with NON-OFFICIAL MLB stats is unimaginable. Yes, they beat everyone else to market, but what kind of product is it. I rather drive a 1999 Mustang (ELIAS) than a 1999 Yugo (STATS, Inc) without the engine. True baseball fans CAN wait the extra month for the correct and OFFICIAL stats from any non-STATS vendor"
3,why is it so short,"The song is very beautiful and i dont see why it is so short ( steady as the beating drum,and paint with the colors of the mountain) i really feel they should be a little longer. I mean you want peope to buy the CD but they really cant decide if they want it or not because they dont have enough to listen to, and every one has'nt seen the movie"
5,Pocahaontas is a truly spledid CD,"Pocahontas is a CD that not only teaches history, but also teaches children to love the world around them."
4,Pocahontas:a living legend,"Mabye some people prefer to say that Disney movies and songs are to ""small"" for them, and that they have become grown-ups. I am only thirteen, but I am still a numder 1 Disney fan. In my school, everyone teases me about that, sometimes it hurts me and sometimes I am pleased and proud to de a Disney fan. So, to get to my review... The Pocahontas soundtrack, which is sung by various artists, touches me deep inside my heart, just like the movie did. My favorite song being Colors of the Wind, sung by Judy Kuhn, I am a fan of songs that are very slow and touching. these types of songs touch me deep inside and i would hope that one day I would be one of those famouse slow singers. to wrap it up, I would like to say that even though my review doesn't focus only on the soundtrack, but my main reason to post it is to wake some people up and tell them that without Disney, there would be no hope in our children."
4,Wonderful Soundtrack,"I casually picked up this soundtrack while in Tower Records a few years ago; I always liked the movie so I figured why not have the soundtrack as well. Admittedly, Manken did not quite capture the magic that was so apparent in ""The Little Mermaid"" & ""Beauty and the Beast"", but it still is a marvelous score and the songs are top-class. My favorite instrumental cuts are 'River's Edge' and 'Farewell'. Of the songs, ""Colors of the Wind"" and ""Mine, Mine, Mine"" are standouts. This may be a notch below Manken's first three scores for Disney but it's definitely a few notches above his later efforts."
2,Too few videos,"This DVD was very disappointing considering how many music videos were actually on this. There are about 5-6 only and they could have put on heaps more. For this alone, I'd be very hesitant to order any more of this DVD series of essential videos. Especially if you want to watch them for a while. This way, it would only take up half an hour at most to watch. Admittedly, what clips are here, are quite good."
5,Brilliant if more ideologically-polished,"A simply brilliant work of places hidden and unreachable for the most of travellers recent Afghanistan and Iran are provides a significant amount of information on daily routine and history of areas an author attended.However, one could say, more modern stories of Kamchatka and Pakistan ought to be approached with practical scepticism towards traditionally gloomy attitude to regions Australian doco-maker's spark of local experience presents.Interesting, educative, broadening knowledge."
5,Really Enjoyable.,"Seller was prompt. Material arrived when predicted. Material was in excellent shape as advertised. Material was as adveristed, good olde kung-fu movies. I am not an expert, except in what I like. I can see why this was the model for Lucy Lu in Kill Bill. These are fun movies. I will use this seller again."
4,Good stuff,A fun album to listen to all the way through. Ended up playing it more than once as the beats just flow right into next.
3,These guys are funny,"Their hit 'humpty dance' is the best song on this album, but there are other songs that make this album an average when it comes to purchasing this album. The songs are enjoyable and funny."
4,A good time to be had by all,"In the history of rap, there have been a few monumental albums: Straight Outta Compton, Fear of a Black Planet, The Chronic, just to name a few. Sex Packets by Digital Underground is not one of them. It doesn't break any new ground, smash any barriers, or raise any consciousnesses. Instead, it just lays down some funky beats and amusing rhymes to produce a great party album. It's truly remarkable to see just how well this album has stood the test of time.So, if you just want to get your groove on, get this album. You won't regret it."
4,Somthing's Missing Here,"I remember first buying the cassette at my local swap-meet back in the day. It was when I was fooled into believing that Shock-G and Humpty were 2 different people. I still have that cassette to this day. I did notice that on that cassette, there was a track that isn't included with this CD. That track was called ""Hip Hop Doll"". It was also a B-side of Doowutchyalike on the 12"" back in the day. Other that this missing classic, it is a good CD to purchase. If it had ""Hip Hop Doll"" on here, it would be worth 5 stars instead of 4 stars."
4,/WEST COAST FL@V@/,"These dudes are the dope! Shock-G, Humpty, the whole crew. Cool concept record that is an infectious and fun ride through an amusement park full of hedonism and funk. Great beats and samples with raucous vocals. These holmies know how to peep!Some of my favorite tracks are: ""The Humpty Dance""/""Underwater Rhymes""/""Gutfest""/""Freaks Of The Industry""-This has got to be a high point with X-Rated lyrics and hot Donna Summer sample! /""Doowutchyalike"".This is a classic party CD. Throw this on and grab a 40...Yo!"
2,"WEB programming and dont talk about Serlvet, C, etc...","When i bought this book i was looking for a whole sight of the tools that i can find in opensource, not only a few... this book needs a roadmap view.Why? theres is no reference for C or JAVA. Why? theres no refence to modules for Apache? Why? theres no references to JDBC, DBD/DBI, databases in general....Anyway a good book? but with a quite good aproach to the problem"
2,"why this book , should be re-written",i belive this book lacked of information about database information and reference to C
1,I got spooked on this one,"This book was recommended by Zane and she shouldn't have done that. I did not like the story...it was old and stale. You can forget about reading the sequel. Instead, read a book called, ""Another Man's Wife"" by Shonda Parks."
4,Excellent,I can't write a good enough review for this book.I have read a lot of books on spousal abuse but this one seemed more down to earth then most...it didn't seem as though Mia tried to make excuses for why she stayed she stayed with Brice she stayed for love...maybe this isn't the best review but if you are thinking of reading this book. Please do...
5,Great book to read!!!!,I love all her books.Each one of her books from the first page to the last page you will not be able to put down at all.Once you are done reading this book you are looking for!!!!
5,The Ties That Bind: An PeoplewholoveGoodBooks Review,"This was one of the best books that I have read this year, (along with the sequel ""Loose Ends""). It's the story of Brice, Mia, and Christian. Mia meets and falls in love with Brice, they marry. Christian and Brice are life-long friends that are more like brothers. As Mia settles into her marriage with Brice, his ""true colors"" begin to show and having no else to turn to, Mia begins to turn to Christian. Meanwhile, after being asked to watch over Mia while Brice is away, Christian falls in love with her. Their friendship comes to an end and Mia's marriage with Brice comes to an explosive end! This book is a must-read! I give it 5 stars!Reviewed by Shay CPeoplewholoveGoodBooks"
5,Thank God for those Binding Ties !!!,"This book is ooohh ssssssssoo Good!! At times i felt like I could talk to Mia and she would hear me. Mia, had a very hard lesson to learn, and Brice had to break a really bad habit that was passed on to him. But as my mother would say ""You never miss your water till you're well runs dry""Christian is a better man than most people see him. Even if is a womanizer.And most men would not have treated this situation the same as Christian.What a true friend.I don't want to say to much it might give the story away. PLEASE GO OUT AND BUY THIS BOOK !!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great Story,"I read this and ""Loose Ends"" some time ago but did not own them. I ordered both books to add to my collection, but when I received them I read both again and loved the story just like the first time. I was a little disappointed with Mia and Brice's characters but not the story which is not completely tied up until you read ""Loose Ends"""
4,campware grease cup holder,"The original grease cup holder for my gas barbecue grill was thrown away and I was not able to find a replacement at the company that makes this brand, but you came through and had what I was looking for at a very reasonable price, (better than the other on-line stores that I checked) and I received it within 3 days. I like this one better as it holds a bigger can. Thanks, you have made my barbecue season a success!"
3,Grease Catcher,"It works, a little small and you can only use small soup cans, would be better if it accepted larger cans."
4,Dictionary of Slang,Out of words on your great american novel? A good book to have to refresh your memory. OR teach you some new ones.
5,Great little item..,I bought this for my Granddaughter- she loves Strawberry Shortcake.Can use the magnets on other things- she puts them on the Fridge!!
4,Keeps her busy at times,"I bought this book for my daughter's birthday since she was having a strawberry shortcake birthday party, its a very nice book, keeps her busy at times,but its not all that educational in my opinion. but very cute!"
3,HOW I LOOKED IN THE COMPUTER FOR OPTIMUS PRIME,"IN VEHICLE MODE, OPTIMUS PRIME IS A FUTURISTIC TRUCK W/TRAILER. HE WAS KINDA BULKY AND STRANGE. HIS JAPANESE NAME WAS GALAXY CONVOY BECAUSE THE JAPANESE VERSION OF CYBERTRON IS GALAXY FORCE. PRIME STILL LOOKS COOL. IN ROBOT MODE, HE LOOKS WEIRD. HIS HEAD LOOKS SILLY. I MEAN THAT HE LOOKS MEAN WITH THE MOUTH. IN JET MODE, IT LOOKS LIKE A TRUCK WITH WINGS. NOTHING DIFFERENT. IN TURRET MODE, PRIME'S TRAILER IS LIKE ATTACK MODE. HIS WEAPON IS ATTACHED THERE BECAUSE EVERY CYBERTRON FIGURE INCLUDES A CYBER PLANET KEY. IT FEATURES AN AWESOME FUNCTION. IN SUPER MODE, HE NOW HAS A MOUTHPLATE. YES, PRIME IS COMBINED WITH HIS TRAILER. NO, PRIME ISN'T THAT EXPENSIVE TO BUY FOR PRE-ORDER NEXT MONTH. WHEN YOU OPEN HIS CHEST, YOU WILL SEE A MATRIX. I'M NOT A FAN OF RED, GRAY, BLUE, YELLOW, BLACK, AND GOLD ON THE WHEELS. STILL OPTIMUS IS COOL AND TOUGH."
5,Finally a decent Prime,"This figure is what a lot of transformers fan have been waiting for. Prime now has a lot of posability which previous versions were lacking, also he is also proportioned correctly no gut on this one. I love the figure, simple transformation and decent super robot mode with the back pack"
1,I Thought This Book Was Horrible!!!,"I reserved this book from the library curious to see what names were in this book. What I found out was that pretty much every possible name was in this book. Now there are some pretty horrible names out there, but a lot of the names in this book are common names that have been around for a long, long time. Maybe I should lighten up a bit, but I was a tad offended when I read what the author wrote about my name, my husbands name and my daughter's name (we all have pretty common names). The only name he really didn't have anything bad to say about was David which is good for him seeing it is his name and my father since it's his name too. Other than that all of my family and friends' names were knocked."
5,Excellent work,All concepts are well explained and it is a pleasure reading this book. A must for all students who wish to understand Capital Budgeting
4,A refreshing perspective on intercession.,"I've read lots of books on prayer--I was to the point where I thought there was nothing new to say! But, fortunately, I was wrong. Alves approaches intercession as a God-given burden that can best be fulfilled by alignment with the personality of the Intercessor. Just be myself. I don't have to be ""Praying Hyde"" or ""Amy Carmichael."" I just need to be me, and pray according to my burdens. Glory to God."
4,Intercessors - Discover Your Prayer Power,"This book was liberating, encouraging, and informative. The personal examples were enjoyable to read. I found that I didn't enjoy reading as much about the type or types of intercessors that I didn't relate to; but that in itself helped me narrow down the type of intercessor I'm becoming."
4,Very Informative!!!!!!,I have read this book and passed it around to many close friends. If you feel the tug of God on your heart to be an intercessor then you really should read this book. I never knew there were so many different types of intercessors and I found myself in several. Sometime you have to know what TYPE of intercession is need at that moment becuase it's deeper than just saying a prayer! Buy this book you won't be sorry!
2,Good But COULD BE BETTER,"When I got this game, i was totally ready. But when I started playing, it was not what I expected. The graphics are okay but when it comes to the overall game, this one is not worth your money.PROS: Good graphics, challenging you get to choose which side you are on.CONS:BORRING, the rules (they are called the perfect rules, talk about corny), the plot, and the setting.Overall if you do like Yu-Gi-Oh, I recommend the SACRED CARDS for GBA, this game is okay at times. You should only get it if you plan on selling it later or if you are an extreme Yu-Gi-Oh fan."
5,Best game ever,"this game is the best game ever. this game has the best graphics and is the best yugioh game made so far. as soon as i bought it i also looked at the cards were alpha the magnet warrior,beta the magnet warrior and 1 more card"
4,Not a good game.,"I could give this game 0 stars,but the graphics are Great.If in some way someone can contact KONAMI and tell them to make a game with the real dueling style a lot of kids could be happy.I rented this game for my son and he did not like it.The gameplay is tottaly different and is hard for a biginner.Im glad i rented it first.Although the graphics are great,the gameplay is really not."
5,The Best Game Ever,I think this is the best game ever because it follows the tv show in a lot of ways and you feel like your actually their in the duel monsters world!
4,One of the best Yu gi oh games to date,"Just as much fun as it was almost 7 years later. A cross between chess and dueling, if you don't have it get it."
1,??????????????,i dont know ... it does not work and the first time it didnt even arrive atall. nothing good to say really ...
4,"Trust me, don's buy this game!","This game just plain sucks. Don't listen to other people and their high reviews. I love yu-gi-oh and I love types of games like this, but this game reeks. The battles suck, the styles suck, its very slow, there is no strategy involved at all, and the game is too hard to be worth it! I'm not the kind of person to listen to reviews, but trust bme on this one, you will be disappointed in this game. Spend your 30 bucks on something worthwhile, like anything else!"
1,Yi-Gi-Oh is not for children,"This game will have good graphics and okay gamplay but is just so hard for kids to grasp on (i read a preview about it), and the idea of deuling mosters does not appeal to anyone over 15, so do a favor and don't get this game ( i did play the sample of it at E3), it stunk, THE COMPANY DID NOT SHOW AUDIENCE AWARENESS)And the stratagy guide is coming November, while like game comes December (thats not smart!)This didn't even deserve the 1 star I gave it!"
1,"The Water is Black, and Catches Fire Easily......","Okay, I've never actually played this game. But, we have seen here its unholy power to ensnare ten year old children into idol worshipping it. I think we all that that is a very bad thing. Quite evil indeed."
1,Don't Buy This!!,"If you haven't already burned your eyes by playing this horrible Yu-Gi-Oh game don't buy it!! The graphics are bad, the gameplay is bad, and to top it all off, the game is really hard! Use your money to buy something better!"
1,This is a very dull game and too advanced.,The controls are so advanced you don't know what button does what and it doesn't even tell you.
4,The Gratest card game for the PS2,Hey this game is a must get for all you yugioh freaks out there like me. I had this game on pre-order since last july. I couldnt wait to get this game. And when i finally got it icouldnt stop playing it. This game was awsome. and if you to cetain websites and get cetain passwords i wont mention any you can beat the game in like a week 1/2 like i did. Still after u beat the game you can keep dueling to get yer deck even stronger. Plus you get the 3 magnet warriors as the promo cards. That makes this game all that much better i hope this review was helpful to you and if you have any questions about the game or anything yugioh just email me at [e-mail] PE@CE OUT!!!
3,rose duelist,"its pretty good if you cheat in it according to my son. he looked passwords but he still thinks its hard!!! he also says it takes forever for him to rank up!!! the enemy has extremely good deck leader abilities lke lp recovery. Its only fun if you are very experianced (and cheat alot). Always rent this firstps if you want the best deck type in for the name jeff, you get kaiser dragon 2100 atak as strongest with sky dragon 1900 attack"
4,THIS GAME RULIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,In the game I startid with the bad side. Thar is easer oponits in the evol side.so far I played more than 700 hrs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Don't even think of buying it,This game is hard man. I have to always use cheats in one of myprogamers magazene. I also have trouble figuring out how the game works. You can't even actavate a trap or magic card without seeing the lame tutoral 8 times. It gives Yugiho a very bad name. Also a waste of money.
1,Incredibly boring,This game sucks! I played it with my dad about 2 years ago and we had to sit through the flippin tutorial for like 5 hours!!! We quit after a half an hour and we never played it again. The main problems are:1. It's nothing like yugioh2. You have to sit through the tutorial for 48 hours3. The controls don't make any sense4. It's more like dungeon dice monstersDon't buy this at all
1,why i dont like this game!!!!!,"This game was a complete disapointment, i bought it feb24,2003 and the game simply wasn't worth it. The gameplay was nothing at all like forbidden memories, it was more like dungeon dice. They should have specified the kind of game it was going to be. In the reviews and when i saw the screenshots i thought that the graphics were awsome and i also thought that it was going to be like the trading card with all the rules and all because as we all know that forbidden memories even though it was very realistic it lacked almost every single rule in the game. I recommend to everyone do not buy this game, you'll simply be wasting your money, better buy the gba game eternal duelist soul. it has all the rules and the gameplay its what I think we're all looking for.!!!!1"
3,members.fortunecity.com/yugimutou,"This game is AWESOME!The cards are,the characters are tough,and,sadly enough,this game cheats you.It plays like Dungeon Dice Monsters.And,you have those point things that limit your deck on good cards.Then again,I rented it and the store didn't give me an instruction booklet so the game was worse than it really was.Anywaymyou get a bad deck and your opponents get good ones.But anyway,just buy this game at amazon because it's my favorite place to shop due to their LOW prices."
4,TERRIBLE,"Dont waste your money on this.... first of all there is like an hour of nothing but dialouge in the begining. and when your trying to pick a card there is all this ""ART""...all over the place to make things extra confusing. the gameplay(when you finaly get to actually do something with the ever-lasting dialouge) is Terrible. oh yea the name of the game is Yugi-oh right? you cant even be yugi you have to make your own name to play. heed my words dont waste your [money] on this garbage."
2,Not the best out there,"I was thinking of buying this game when it came out but instead rented it first. I was glad I rented it. I would not wanted to play 50 dollars for such a low quality game. First off this is really not a card game and should not be called one. It is more like checkers and you will find the players very hard to beat. I do not mind a challenge but come on, this is insane. You also start off with weak cards that your opponent can destroy 90 percent of the time. The tutor is well done though so you can learn how to play pretty quickly. I would buy the game if I found it for 15 to 20 bucks but I would not pay 50 dollars for such a game. If you want to play the true card game play Yu-Gi-Oh! The Eternal Duelists Soul for GBA, which in my opinion is the best YGO game out. I would deeply recommend you rent it before buying it. It is not too good."
4,OK,This game is good but one thing. The fusion card can barely be used you should be able to use it whenever you want to. That's all about the bad side of this game
4,How Fun Is This Game?,This game is the most funnest game out of all the Yu-Gi-Oh games. If you are a complete fan of Yu-Gi-Oh and if you are obsessed with it this game is just right for you. It has a good price of $29.99 plus tax. So if I were you I would get this game right now.
4,One of all the cruddiest and hardest games on PS2!!!,I wouldn't buy it again if they relabled and gave me a subscription to Yu Gi Oh Fanatic Dayly!(with does not exist)This game is poor. It's like the PS1 game but better in some ways.
2,Ohhhhhhhhhhhh mmmmy gggggggoodd,"The Bad ThingsFirst of all, you have to move the cards to the opponents.To easy(starter deck really good but not all)Cards are to easy to win.The passwords make your deck really good.At the end it is like there is nothing to do.God cards are hard to findThe Good ThingsGraphiqs are fantasticYou Get Alpha Gamma And Beta The magnet warriorsGet terrain builder wen you pass all the game.I played this game for 1 month and i had already mastered it. My Conclusion is: dont buy this game if you want a good YuGiOh game or buy dawn of destiny(if you have an xbox.)"
4,Yugioh DUELIST OF ROSES,This is a really cool and fun game. It featrues events from both the card game and dungen dice monsters. I really recomend this game if you are a true yugioh fan.
2,Eh.,"This game is just ok, nothing better. The game does have many monsters and good graphics, but the gameplay is stupid. People that play the actual card game will find the way this game is played much different. Also, the cards that come with the game may be rare, but they are not very good. I would seriously recomend renting the game before you buy it because you might find, as I did, that the game is not very good."
4,Great game,"I love the Yu Gi Oh games, this one especially. It isn't terribly hard, and it's a good way to spend some time if you don't want to get out and just need to spend a few hours at home."
2,Yu-gi-oh: Duelist of Roses is a disgrace to Duel Monsters,"This game is horrible. It does not stick to the Duel Monsters that die-hard fans love and play. Watching the show is one thing. Playing in official tournaments is other. This doesn't fit into either. Its a mixture between chess and Duel Monsters. If i wanted to play chess, I would play Chessmaster or Battle Chess. Konami dropped the ball this time. The only reason the sales will be high b/c its a Yu-gi-oh game. In my opinion Konami needs to redo it and revamp the fusions like they are suppose to be."
2,Yu Gi Oh Duelist of the Soul,"I am a huge fan of Yu-Gi-Oh! I have to warn you though, if you are looking for a game that plays like the actual card game, this is not the answer. In this game you have 4000 LP like the anime series now has. But you play on a chess board. You can only lay down one card per turn (whether that is a monster card or a trap card is up to you). This SEVERELY limits your capabilities for those great combos you've seen in the anime series. You have to move your monsters in position (you can only move them 1 space per turn) before you can attack the opponent's monsters. The graphics seem like they should be a lot better for a PlayStation 2 platform, but nonetheless it is great when compared to the GameBoy Advanced games.Nothing like the actual card game or the anime series.But still a fun game, I was just a little disapointed."
1,"Don't bother, too much blah, blah, not enough action.","I was very dissapointed in this version and would not recomend this game, especially for young players under 12. It takes much too long with senseless dialouge and finally when you do get to the action, is not user freindly. The Playstation 1 version is much better and easier in addition to being ... cheaper.PS: Toys R Us does not provide refunds for any opened games, save yourself fifty dollars and pass on this game. I wish I had!"
1,Great graphics horrible game play,"First off this game is ridiculously complex for children. I orginaly purchased it for my 4 and 6 year old as they are big fans of the show, and there is no way that they could play this.Second the story line is horrid. I mean you expect it to follow the show to some extent. Instead your taking a side in the British war of the roses. I mean how many kids that would be playing this game even know what the war of the roses is.Third the difficulty is very high. You start out with two set opponents and right from the start they have monsters who are much stronger than anything you have. Only by blind luck can you win enough to gain more cards."
2,6 years old,"this game... is six years old...the interface in the begining... the.. interaction in the middle.... why couldnt they have voice overs.. its.. BORING to READ..why couldnt they make a new yu-gi-oh for ps2 only??they just add on the old game with some ""3d"" graphics and calling this a ps2 game....i am very disappointed..."
4,Worthwhile,"I bought this game just this week and already find myself hooked. But be warned this game is not for those who are easily frustrated. You've probably heard that there are over 680 3-D rendered monsters, and that's true, but this game is all about strategy and outhinking your opponents, knowing what monsters to use in certain situations. During the game you must select a deck with which to duel, and pick wisely because the deck you choose could mean a constant losing streak resulting in constant restarts. The graphics are somewhat on par with those of the Final Fantasy series (it's like a constant summoning of monsters). And in closing this game is right up there with some of the best in terms of strategy and graphics, but don't be fooled it's not as easy as you think"
4,Good Game. You need to think more than most games.,"This game is a good all around game. The gameboard is alot like chess, certain monsters can move more than others on certain terrains. The ability to change the terrain also helps in the strategy.Also, you can't just stack your deck to over power your opponent. Each area has deck point restrictions, making your card choices crucial.The only negative I have found is, when you play your cards are given to you in a random order, the computer however seems to constantly draw powerful card combinations in the same order on a constant basis. This makes it a bit unfair at times, but yet predictable and challenging.All in all, if you like yu-gi....or chess, you'll like this game."
1,Big Let Down,"I'm two things, a Yu-Gi-Oh fan and a video gamer. And whens these two things collide it isn't pretty. The first problem with its game is the graphics. they are what you would suspect from a PSX and not a PS2. The plot is also another problem, why are we in the 1400s and why can't I play being Kaiba of Yugi. The Final problem, the game is so darn hard, your deck is absoulute weak with very few useful cards and the A.I. is so hard to beat you would almost have a better chance of winning the lottery. In Short, Yugi fans you have been warned rent it first. Anyone else just stay away from this game."
3,Not Really A Kids Game,"I bought this game for my 7 year old who is completely wacko about Yu-Gi-Oh! The vocabulary of the Tutorial was WAAYYY over his head, so I had to read the whole thing to him. (ex: words such as ""aforementioned"" and ""judicious"" are used) He lost interest in listening to me read about half way through. The rules are all laid out in the tutorial and are reminiscent of bridge in their complexity. While adults who enjoy playing strategic card game may become enthralled, young kids, the primary consumers of Yu-Gi-Oh! products will lose interest before the end of the Tutorial. All the flash and eye-candy is there....all the kid fun is missing."
1,wouldbe negative 5 stars,i hate this game.yu-gi-oh buyers beware this is almost impossible to beat!It takes foreever to summon a blue eyes if your luckey to get a blue eyes that is.If i were you i would just buy yu-gioh falsebound kingdom for the gamecube.If you are buying this for a young child he will be so unhappy so do him\her a favor and dont buy this game
5,Makes me proud but when can I play as Seto?,Yu-Gi-Oh the greatest card game ever to me.This game sereves it justice i've played the japinnese version it was to cool!3-D graphics are good and the story is not bad.Will they ever make a game when you can play as Seto Kaiba!
1,not rated for everyone,My 7 year old wanted this for his birthday so I got it for him. He does Yu-Gi-Oh cards everyday and knows just about everything there is to know about the cards. He was bored with this game in less than 5 minutes. It had just to much talking between the charactors and nothing to tell you how to use them. I took this game back the very next day..
1,SUCKS DO NOT BUY!!,I rented this game from blockbuster today I really enjoyed the gameboy games and I thought this would be even better. I WAS SO WRONG!! The game play is nothing like the show or the card game. It makes absolutely no sense!! If u have enough money I think u should buy the gameboy games or buy a Playstation 2 game like Vice City!!
4,Yu Gi Oh Rules!!!!!!!!!,This game will be the best ever.I personaly know that people of all ages play the card game. This game is better for teens and adults. I'm 16 and can't wait to get this game. The harder the better. It's even better if you play the actual card game.
2,A throwaway,"And a tolerably worthwhile throwaway, considering Lukacs's knowledge of his subject. If you have decent familiarity with the issues, this book won't weigh you down and it adds nuance to the accepted portrait of Churchill. But this is certainly not an introduction to Churchill and the author's biases, particularly against Eisenhower, mar the presentation. This chafed at me in particular, and I hold no particular brief for Ike. But Lukacs is an historian, yet he swipes at Eisenhower throughout the second half of the book, almost never building an argument but rather using innuendo. He largely assumes that the reader shares his biases, more in the way of punditry than scholarship. I don't regret reading the book, but I am sure I could have made more productive use of the time and money on another Churchill work."
3,A fan book on Churchill,"What we have is a series of essays written about Churchill by a man who is both a highly regarded historian and a fan.The last essay, I found quite moving where he discusses his time at Churchill funeral.Yet the quality of these essays is not brilliant. In some ways they are repetitive with the same facts repeated again in another essay. Also the writer is also prone to exaggeration eg that the Germans could in June or July 1940 successfully invaded Britain.I have read much on Churchill and found this book disappointing maybe as from a historian of the quality of John Lukacs, I expected more."
2,Insightful but not gripping,"Lukacs is a historian and an academic. Although Lukacs the historian makes this book very insightful and accurate, Lukacs the academic makes the book less gripping. The writing style and the content are not intended for casual readers who intend to learn about Churchill by reading this book alone.For casual readers, I would suggest other Churchill books like ""Winston Churchill"" - by John Keegan."
3,"Decent, but not compelling...","For the record, I admire John Lukacs as a historian... However, this thin volume (essentially a collection of mini-essays) doesn't really do much to add to the already abundant amount of Churchill scholarship... Lukacs clearly worships Churchill and therefore the book comes across as a simple hagiography. Lukacs' strength is his ability to spin a narrative while not getting bogged down with excessive facts. However, sometimes he can seem to wander off on rather obscure emotional tangents...This book is fine as an introduction to Churchill, but for someone who wants a more in-depth look at the great man, I suggest turning to the rather more weighty biographies by Martin Gilbert and Roy Jenkins, or indeed his own earlier, and infinitely more interesting title, ""Five Days in London."""
2,Not very good.,"I'll admit, this is the only book of Sanders that I've read other than the McNally Series (which I love), but I was very dissapointed with this book. The story was dull and the characters lacked wit and personality. Although I'm sure one day I will, this novel has made me disinterested in reading any of his other books."
1,P.U.! Stay away!,"The book, if read ironically, would be a weak satire, but I don't think this is what Sanders intended. Coming at it as a Christian potboiler (if that's even a genre), it starts pretty bad and proceeds to fall flat on its bottom. The (laughable) descriptions of the sex act were just plain creepy, and those inclined to religion will hate the way Brother Kristos fulfills every stereotype of the preacher who is a money-hungry, hypocritical zealot. I'm not a Christian, and even I found it to be uncalled for.Basically, the book is a whole list of failures. Put every category out there- narrative, characterization, dialogue, language- and all are found to be lacking. This was my first and last venture into the world of Lawrence Sanders, and if you're smart you'll never pick up his fiction to begin with. Zero stars."
1,I was waiting 2 laugh,"Bad, just plain bad, I did not even laugh once. The first flick Waiting was very good, funny & witty even though it had no plot it worked very well with the funny bone. The original actors in Waiting had the chemistry to play off of one another & delivered the laughs. Still Waiting just was plain flat & boring. Even with some of the original cast members that were in Still Waiting, they did not strike any chemistry with its fellow actors. It would have been nice to continue the original cast at Shenaniganz instead of at the Ta Ta's restaurant. I could think of a million other shenaniganz the original cast could have dipped into instead of this bad attempt of a sequel. Nice try but 2 bloody thumbs down. Schroeder (Publisher/Owner) of Cult Movies Magazine WACK ""O"" Publishing & Orbital Traxx Records."
3,Good effort,"First thing out I want to say this is much better than other direct to DVD sequels. Sure the ""big names"" weren't here but why would they be? In the storyline two years have passed and it's not unrealistic in two years time to have people move on or change roles in a work environment. How many direct to DVD sequels get as many of the orginal cast to return as this did? I actually can't think of any. Alanna Ubach once again brings big laughs as Naomi. If you liked the first (and like plenty of T & A) check this out. Worth it just to see what happned with the returning cast."
1,Crap,"This is the worst movie in the history of the world. Wish I could give it negative stars but I can't. Instead of wasting money on this just plunge a hot knife into your eyes, that would be more enjoyable."
2,Barely fun,"This movie has almost none of the magic of the original. The Stifler-esque racist, the butthole cooks, it was just boring. The only two saving graces of the movie were the super-pretty Amber, and Naomi, who's amped up her craziness from the first movie. Reminds me of a crazy girl I know in the Deep South. Otherwise, it was almost unwatchable. Good thing I rented it instead of buying it!"
2,america's critic,"this one fell short for a sequal especially with the racist kid on here wth were they thinking, girls girls and unrated with one scene lol ok its rated pg13 so not unrated--- im so sick of unrated stuff just pure bullcrap, watch this if its a last resort but wouldn't pay more than $3 for this one"
2,2 1/2 STARS IN A GOOD WAY!,"I enjoyed the film waiting and I was very interested in seeing this direct to video sequel. I doesn't have the twisted charm of the original, but the cast seems to be having a good time. The jokes are gross, the characters aren't as good as the first film, but it is enjoyable for people who like this sort of thing. I have seen this one in the bargain bin, but I don't think I need to own this, I've seen it and I may see it one more time in my life, but that's about it. If you want a lesser version of the first film too watch, maybe you should rent this one?"
2,sucks,first one was alright... seemed like they tried to copy the first one too much in this and didnt make me laugh very much.... 2 stars
3,Gross-out humor,Filled with gross-out humor (not my style) but actually probably not as gross as the original. Several attractive female stars in this production as well. Pretty standard teen humor fare with the feeling of a production from the late '90s or early 2000s. Might have been more popular had it been released a decade earlier.
3,"Not bad, not great, and not that funny","I watched Waiting when I worked in a resturant and that it was a decent comedy. It reminded me of the place I work expect messing with the food, that was sick. Still Waiting still has a few of the lesser known actors in this movie but it just wasn't too funny. I rolled my eyes when I saw Justin Long, I dont know why i'm probably sick of seeing this guy on mostly every film. While it wasn't really funny I still enjoyed it. Worth checking out once even if you haven't seen the first movie."
5,the comic strip presents-the complete collection,I didn't expect that I could find the whole bloody thing in the USA that I could view without a special DVD player!!! Brilliant 26 hours of good ol' Comic Strip Humour!!!! Well worth it!!!!
2,Detailed instructions?,"Though this book does have a few very nice celebrety portrait paterns built into it, the author does not go to any great lenghts to tell you how to achieve these results yourself. The instructions may as well have been ""use your computer to edit a digital photo or use tracing paper to create a scroll saw portrait pattern in black and white."" The instructions on how to digitally manipulate the photographs were so basic that anybody with any understanding of computers would not need this book, and could find out what he tells you from the help menu of your favorite program. The book consists of roughly 10% instruction (ie. pictures of what he is doing), 90% patterns, so if you really want some of these nifty patterns, buy the book, if you want to find out how to create patterns, look elswhere."
2,Not much Help.,If you want to turn your photographs into patterns you might look else where. There are no instructions telling you how to use software. You are told to get a software product that will let you work with pictures. In one photo you are shown a dog with one ear being dark. You are told to copy the ear from the other side onto the dark ear. You are not told how to do it---just do it.Ther are many patterns already made. If you are looking for premade patterns then you may enjoy this book.
3,You can't catch lightning twice...,"I bought this CD with the hope that it would capture some of the superb 1963 ""The Wham of That Memphis Man"", the LP which I bought then based only on his hit instrumental ""Memphis"" - I ended up being totally shocked and staggered by his outstanding blues singing on ""Why"" and ""Satisfied"". So 50 years later I figured, hey, whatever happened to Mr. Mack? He must have done more such stunning work soon after that, right? Indeed, he is still touring, God bless him. This followup set of tracks, however, shows that you cannot expect to match perfection. Very good stuff, especially ""Oh I Apoligise"" - and I can only dream how great his instrumental version of ""I Found A Love"" would be if he had sung it. Surely he was the best R&R guitarist (sorry Jimmie), but his voice was the real classic instrument. In short, this CD is very good, just not perfect."
3,Good but not great...,"This book does have many questions, but they are often overly simple and leading. If you really don't know the person you are about to marry, this is probably a good start, but I felt it lacked hard questions."
5,This book is the great 'unearther' for us.,"""Dont you dare get married until you read this""...presented both my fiancee and i a compelling way to discover each other. Corey's uncanny way to help us reach at issues now that would only unearth later is remarkable. This book is the 'lightswitch' to any relationship that lies before the road of marriage."
1,Author info,"Potential buyers should be aware that the author of this book is currently in jail and awaiting trial for bank robbery. Although he is innocent until proven guilty, it is relevant information to consider before purchasing a self-help book. Google the authors name and bank robbery for details."
1,Don't buy this book until you've read this review...,"Glad to see that they reduced the price of this turkey, but it's still a disappointment to anyone expecting real insight. I just can't muster support for a kid trying to tell the rest of us how to have a successful marriage before he knows whether or not his is successful. The book reads like a senior project for a college sociology course, filled with aphorisms and quotes but little genuine content and no analysis.Call your married friends or talk to a counselor before you get married, but don't depend on this book to give you real insights."
4,"Goo Book, Not Great",I Love the Questions in this book but There is not room for me or my boyfriend to write in it. Better if you have a extra notebook to put the question on so you and your parter or you will have plenty of room.
1,Naive,"Get this book for assistance creating a regimented, boring marriage. Completely obvious and not a worthwhile exercise."
4,Sometimes academic rigour is what's needed,"This two-volume history of the Mexican Revolution is absolutely packed with case studies and individual narratives. Knight's vision is one of many and various Mexicos, all of which experienced a different revolution. Far from being simply to entertain, the role of a history text is to explain what happened. Knight puts forward a strong, if not universally accepted, case for the dismissal of grand theories of a single process, instead arguing that the revolution meant one thing to the generals of the north, quite another to the peasants of the centre, and very little to (for example) the Indians of the south. The reader may feel confused by the book; there is nothing wrong with such an outcome - it was a confusing period of history during which few people knew what was happening and with what likely effect."
2,Not the entire story,"While this book does cover some business essentials, the real meat could have been covered in a 12 page booklet. A lot, as those of us who are actually in business know, is not covered.You can skip this one."
2,A very basic book for true business novices only,"This is a very basic book that will be useful only to somebody who has little business knowledge or education. Although any book in this category must be general enough to cover a wide-range of small businesses, I felt this book was too simplistic and that there are better books, such as ""Working for Yourself"" by Fishman."
3,Small Time Operator,"""Small Time Operator"" by Bernard B. Kamoroff makes you wonder if he ever made it big or just remained small. I agree this is not the bible of business practices. However, the info isn't all that bad. It just lacks real meat."
3,Good Only If You Are Just Getting Started,If you are thinking of just getting starting this book is OK. It gives a lot of very basic information. Once you get started there are better books out there but this is OK to begin with.
3,Okay for the true novice to business,"This book is okay if you have no prior business knowledge. It will bring you up to speed before you read the better books that offer the heavy artillery.For first timers, okay. Experienced, pass."
3,Not a BIBLE but a decent start.,"First of all, let me say that I do not agree with the five star reviews nor do I agree with the 1 star reviews. That said, I feel this book is smack in between and does offer some useful information, especially for the newbie to business.Five stars reviewers are too generous and 1 star reviewers are way too critical.Good book and worth a read."
5,"The most ""user friendly"" manual available today","Now in a fully updated and expanded 24th edition, Bernard Kamoroff's Small-Time Operator continues to be the premier ""how to"" reference for starting a small business, keeping the books, paying taxes, and staying profitable. The most ""user friendly"" manual available today, the aspiring entrepreneur and small businessman will learn how to obtain all necessary permits and licenses, finance their business, find the appropriate location for their business, create and implement a business plan, choose and protect a business name, determine whether or not to incorporate, establish a simple but effective bookkeeping system, hire employees, deal with federal, state and local taxes, buy a business or franchise, utilize the Internet, deal with (or avoid!) the IRS, and much, much more. If you are contemplating starting your own business and only have time to read one book on the subject, then make it Kamoroff's Small-Time Operator!"
1,Not particularly helpful,"There are better books on how to start and run a business. This one is long on words and short on useful, practical information. Reads more like an accountant trolling for business by harping on complications than a genuine self-help book.I bought based on the recommendation of a (well-written) book on self-publishing. Wish I'd read Amazon's comments first and spent my money elsewhere."
5,Really...Six Stars.,"I continue to be impressed by the quality and craftsmanship Novica Artisans offer. This mobile, handcrafted by Peruvian artist Maricarmen Elias, is amazing. Not only is it more beautiful than I gathered from the Novica-provided photograph but it arrived more carefully wrapped than a newborn baby. It's not very often that you feel you should have paid MORE for a purchase...but in this case I felt humbled by the care Ms. Elias put into her craft and the care Novica put into it's customer's shipment. Novica has fast become my favorite online merchant."
5,best game ever,"this game is a childhood classic but on 360, it only runs with my microsoft hdd, but only the one that came with my xbox. not any of my friends xbox's with their hdd's. it only works with my very first hdd which is weird"
4,X box game,this was a gift to my son in law. old game I couldnot find in stores it came with one of the first Xboxes he loved playing at friends it but didn't have the game himself. He was excited when he opened gift.
5,Excellent innovation,"Better interface, smoother animation, better character banter, better methods for interacting and manipulating the environment. Downside is the rifle scope only has 1 zoom level, but not a big deal."
3,SPLINTER CELL : CHOAS THEORY :- REVIEW,"GAMEPLAY:- slow paced , fun at times , map are laid out nicley.8/10GRAPHICS:- nice shadows but overall graphics are very unrealistic. everything is shiny!! water looks likw=e clay , skin on people's faces are even shiny.7/10SOUND/MUSIC:- good sound effects but a terrible music score. amon tobin's score is not good , location of mood music is all over the place.7/10VALUE:- Okay singleplayer , excellent multiplayer.9/10TILT:- good but could have been alot better , a very disapointing musical score , unrealistic ""shiny"" graphics, slow paced gameplay , but excellent multiplayer.OVERALL SCORE :- 3/5 stars ***"
1,I'd rather watch paint dry.......,This game is a sneaking game....no more no less.It has no depth.All you do is sneak which is boring and this game has no variety. Spend your money on paint and watch it dry. Its much better than playing this overrated crap
5,The Best Splinter Cell Experience Yet!,"This game has it all; great physics, graphics and weapons. A vast improvement over other Splinter Cell releases, and that's saying something."
5,"""Chaos Theory"" is one of the funnest games I played.","Both creepy and intriguing, Chaos Theory brings back excitement into console gaming. I've still got a ways to go in the game, but 'boring' is not a word I would use in describing Chaos Theory. Plus, even in 'easy' mode the game is tough from the beginning. So hold on tight, you're in for an excellent ride."
1,suck,this game sssssssssssssuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccccckkkkkkks my freind teddy loves it but its bad to the bone
4,Splinter Cell Chaos Theory Review,"Game was great. Lots of action. Not as good as Pandora Tomorrow or the original SPlinter Cell, but it was still decent."
5,BEST GAME EVER!!!!,"This is no doubt the best videogame, heck, the best game in existence. The first two Splinter Cell games were okay, but this one is spectacular. It is the stealth game everybody was waiting for. The best thing about this game is the scariness of each level. The music builds up, keeping the intensity. The music score is superb. All the gadgets and moves you get to do and use are fun and awesome as well. Just nonstop fun. An awesome story mode, and even includes a multiplayer online game when your done with story mode, keeping you occupied. There is even a coop mode for both on and off line Xbox. The levels are long and creative and have many parts and obstacles for two men to do. This isn't just the 2005 game of the year. This is the game of the century."
