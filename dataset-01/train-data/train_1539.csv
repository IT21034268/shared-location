4,Good Book for Fish Identification,Gives good identification of commonly available fish. Great photos. Doesn't go to in depth with invert identification. Pretty basic on setup.Good beginner book for fish only systems.
4,Different than store . . .,"I bought these Huggies diapers online for a great price with free shipping. When I opened them up, I noticed that the diapers were thinner and more rough (my son has dry skin around the waist and legs from them) than the ones I had just purchased at Target. Just a coincidence or do they make a lesser quality for online bulk purchases??"
2,Fooled again,"When my daughter was first born we used Pampers Swaddlers, because that's what they gave us in the hospital. Since the Pampers were so expensive, and they sell Huggies at Costco, I decided to try a small bag of Huggies to see if they worked. As I was holding my daughter and nursing her, she peed straight out of the side of the diaper, all over me. I thought, Oh, I just didn't close it well. Nope, she did it again the same day.I recently got sick of spending so much on Pampers Cruisers and thought, hey, Huggies now has this ""Natural Fit"" diaper, maybe they're improved. Sigh. My poor daughter peed right through it at the playground, leaving a huge puddle in the middle of the play structure, which I then had to frantically try to clean up before the other toddlers crawled through it.Maybe it's just my daughter, but these things aren't all that absorbent I'm thinking."
2,Mediocre history of a religious movement,"There is nothing really bad with this history - my complaint is simply that I really hadn't learned much of anything after reading it through. Most history texts are chock-full of fact, but this one somehow manages to spread that thin throughout. I can't recommend any better resources on the social gospel, but can simply suggest reading biographies of major figures or more specific books (""The Social Gospel In Black and White"".) The history by Ronald White and C. Howard Hopkins is a better option for a general overview, though it is also far from perfect."
4,an impressive full-length debut,"Although she had released an earlier EP (""Something Good""), this is the first full-length CD from Nashville's Tristen Gaspadarek, released when she was 21. Featuring her original song compositions, ""Among the Crowd"" shows off Tristen on vocals and piano, accompanied by her father Charlie Gaspadarek on guitar (along with numerous other talented musicians).I'm guessing this is out-of-print because she must feel this early work no longer accurately represents her talents or adjustments to her style. But it is thoroughly enjoyable in its own right. Recommended if you've enjoyed her later, easier-to-find music."
1,Avoid This Collection,"OK, this two CD set was NOT what I expected. I love ""Right On Target"" and ""Desire"" and have since I was dancing in the clubs back in the 80's. Other then those two songs, this collection is really average. You'll have to be a fan of Paul Parker to really enjoy it. I'm a fan of 80's club music and danced (...)in (...) bars in Florida, Chicago, Milwaukee, New York City, Boston and my home town of Providence, and I really wanted to love this collection, but I'm really disappointed. You can get ""Right On Target"" and ""Desire"" on other collections along with other songs that you'll recognize and want to play. I'd avoid this collection."
4,Great Horror Movie,I first saw this movie when I was on vacation in the Philippines. I happened to be there when it was first released. Seeing it in the movie theatre of course hightens the experience so when I purchased this I was hoping to have the same experience. Let me just say I was not disappointed. Horror is my favorite genre of movie and this is a pretty good one. An interesting story followed with those sudden scary moments that make you jump out of your seat. I am not Filipino but that plays no role in being able to like this movie. I watched this with my girlfriend (who is filipina)and we both loved it.Both Kris Aquino & Claudine Barretto did a nice job. A must see movie for any Horror fan.ALSO: keep in mind this is the Highest grossing Filipino movie of all time pulling in 186 million in 2006.
4,Always a Hit!,My Kindergarten students always LOVE Miss Bindergarten. I love that there is a book for practically every kindergarten occasion! These books are great!!
2,Not good and no fun,Boring.. waited for this along time and now discover that you cannot control any trip at all.. very unlike the flight sim. just the same old routine again and again.
1,Highly Disappointed,"I was highly disappointed. First of all, it won't even install properly on my Dell laptop, running Win98. Later, whenever I launched it, it will come with error message and request to dial into MS web site for reporting errors, still giving me no clue how to launch it. I was so fed up that I decided to uninstall it. It took me many attempts over one day to uninstall it. I returned it the store for refund. No more games from big brother. My laptop is fine and running every other software perfectly. My biggest beef is that it will try to talk to MS web site without me knowing about contents of transfer. On top of that, MS charges for tech support."
1,MICROSOFT TRAIN SIMULATOR,Only software I own that is prone to crashing my computer. I wish that I had never purchased it.
1,Won't run on ATI Rage Mobility Video Card,"Microsoft Train Simulator will not run on a computer using the ATI RAGE MOBILITY -M video card. I spoke with Microsoft and HP, but there is no fix to this problem. (OmniBook 6000, 256 RAM, 800 Pentium III)"
1,Cannot get this to work!!,"I bought this game for my son to have and no matter what I do I can not get it to work. It contuines to give me the error 'cannot locate the cd-rom. Please insert the correct cd-rom select ok and restart application. Very upsetting for us and a waste of money!! Have tried to email, look at, and call microsoft serveral times but they are worthless and will not help!! Save yourself the headache and buy a train game from someone else other than microsoft!!!!!!"
2,"Fun, but misleading in some respects.","My biggest beef with this game is that Microsoft does not publish ""recommended system requirements."" You should have at least 1.2 GB available on your hard drive. I am running the game on a Celeron 450 with 8MB on the video card and 256 MB of RAM, and the video is still choppy. Fortunately, that's not as critical on a train simulator as it is on a flight simulator."
4,This game is already out,"Hey, guess what... Microsoft train simulator is already out. I bought it this weekend at Electronics Boutique. you can also buy it at ebgames.com. Anyways, this game is really fun to play. most people just think you sit there and watch the scenery go by, but theyre wrong. you have to pay attention to signals and rigorous time schedules. this game is definetly worth buying."
5,Great game for train lovers!,"If your a train lover you will probally like it alot! IT allows you to be right up with the controls of many locomotives, it has superb graphics and great sound. If you are looking for realism this is the game for you. The sounds of the trains are exact and there is doppler effect. For those who don't know how to drive a train there is tutorials that teach you how to operate steam, electric and diesel locomotives. If you don't feel like driving you can take a train ride and be the passenger. The scenery is fantastic it looks just like it would in real life. The passenger trains are very fun to drive, beacause you on a tight shcedule and there are many hazards along the way such as animals on the track, wheather, damaged track, broken signals and more. It also provides the challenge of freight trains. Also there are hundreds of downloads and add-ons for it! So if you like trains and realism I highly recomend this game."
3,Good game - but lots of bugs,"I found this game to be fun overall, but it could be much more fun if it wasn't for all the bugs and lack of features. It frequently crashes, sending Windows 2000 to a blue screen. There is also a very annoying ""coupler broken"" bug that prevents you from finishing many of the activities or running through activities of your own. Also, the editor tools are hopelessly buggy. Typical of Microsoft software, it lacks polish and feels like an early beta version. This game could have been so much more, but falls way short of the target. It could use another 6 months of development time."
4,Incredibly Realistic!!!,"I guess I can't give any reccomendations based on computer speed as I have a fully decked out 1.5G, 512MB computer with a 32MB 3D card and 22"" monitor. Needless to say, the game runs fine. I can see where some people might find it boring, but try and run the Japanese commuter line and actually arrive and leave the stations on time.....My only wish (as with almost all Microsoft simulations) is that Microsoft would show more realistic crashes / derailings /people / cars on tracks. Maybe it's just the Gomez Addams in me, but when I'm heading down a mountain at 100+ mph in Austria, I want the train to jump the tracks and fly down the hill in a blaze....instead, a little prompt comes up advising me that I have derailed. I really need to see people getting on and off the trains as well. What's the point of running a commuter line with empty cars??? Microsoft, please listen and add these features..."
4,Like being inside a real train,"I think this game is terrific but still not ""perfect""Don't get me wrong... I'm a huge fan of trains and I'd loved to become a train engineer, but this game lacks a bit of entertainment.What do I mean by ""entertainment""? Well, once your train is rolling and all signs are clear then you can comfortably go to get a sandwich and a beverage and everything will be the same. And in those ""hard"" scenarios, all you gotta do is to speed up and brake from time to time...Apart from that nuisance, the game is perfect... to drive a steam locomotive like the ""flying scotsman"" is awesome and thrilling.The tutorial is excellent and lets you catch the basics on how to run a train.I've added an expansion pack of the Eurochunnel and now you can be on the cabin of the TGV from Britain to the continent.Good choice for train fans"
2,Turn down those video settings!,"I was excited about getting this game. I love trains. I installed it on my 800 Mh, 256 meg Ram machine and started playing. My system crashed within 5 minutes. I rebooted and it crashed again. Hmmm. I went into the settings and turned down the video to poor quality. Now it doesn't crash. It seems to me, that based on the minimum system requirements, my machine should handle this well. There are other bugs as well; I cannot run my train in snow for example, I get a window asking me if I want to send this error to Microsoft. Then the program shuts down. So, I play this game with the settings turned down and without the full array of options. And I have fun. But a game this expensive should not be shipped with such blatant bugs. Buy it if you love trains, though."
5,A must have for railfans!,"I love this game it's one of my favorites.It includes 6 default routes and plenty of trains to drive. Once you learn, the game is easy to operate. The routes are all very scenic and realistic, and the activities are fun. Even better, you can download or buy custom routes. Pretty much, there is a lot to see in the game. When you explore the routes, its very relaxing.The only major downside is the editors crash a lot and it can be challenging to download some routes, but overall, its a really great game."
4,Fascinating - Better than Model Railroading,"When I first saw the promos for this ""game"" I became hooked. When it arrived, I installed it immediately (I had some trouble with my video driver) and started the introduction. I was immediately caught up with sitting in the cockpit of a diesel locomotive. I have only begun to go through the tutorials, but this game promises to provide hours and hours of great entertainment. The realism is uncanny as you wind through the countryside, pulling into towns, servicing your train. Great job!"
1,five strikes and you are out,"I was unable to get <Train Simulator> to run on either of two computer that I own. One uses Windows XP the other Windows 98I took <Train Simulator> and both my computers to a computer repair shop. The technician was unable to get the game to run on either of his own two computers or either of my computers.A co-worker tried it on his brand new computer. He couldn't get it to run.This makes 5 computers in all that were tested. All computers have Direct X 9.0b. And, the game still didn't work.The game's performance on all 5 computers was the same. The ""tutorial"" functioned normally, but the ""introduction"" and the ""play game"" worked very, very slowly. About every 15 seconds the image would ""refresh."" The sound effects were normal.Support from Microsoft? Ha! Don't make me laugh.Bottom line? One very disappointed 9 year old and one frusturated dad."
2,save your hard earned money,"interesting only because its different. has an empty ""half finished "" feel to it."
4,Love the game but ...,"This is the first version/edition of the game so it's a little bit buggy. The Marias Pass route, in particular, has a notorious spot where the train comes uncoupled every time. Otherwise it's a must for anyone who loves railroads.This game is a lot of fun. Drive passengers on a high-speed rail route, or sort out freight cars and drop them off at sidings. Deal with rain, snow, speed restrictions, other traffic on the line, and more. Drive an electric, diesel, or steam locomotive. If you're up for a real challenge, drive a steam locomotive and act as your own fireman.You can go along for a ride, or take a tutorial lesson in driving a train. Explore the route on your own or try one of the activities. For more advanced users, there's the capability of building new routes and adding activities.Best of all, there are some excellent online sites where fellow Train Simulator enthusiasts offer their own add-ons to the game or where help and suggestions are always available."
4,For Train buffs that enjoy sims...,"If you enjoy trains and complex computer sims than you should enjoy this game. Since I live in Philadelphia, I can attest that the scenary is not only good looking but accurate.Some of the other reviewers have complained about the hardware requirements for the game. I have a Compaq AMD Athlon 1.2ghz, 128 megs RAM, 32mb TNT2 card computer and the game runs smoothy and well except for the opening video sequence.If you are someone that is seriously (and I heavily emphasize that) into trains, than you will enjoy this game. I only deducted a star because it has too few locomotives in it IMHO (what? No Pennsy GG-1 or any American Steam locomotives!).-Tom"
4,Needs better documentation,"This is an outstanding simulator. The sights and sounds are just fantastic. If you like trains, this is the equivalent of eating potato chips, you can't put it down. I have a P4 1.3 with an nVidia Gforce2 32 MB DDR video card. I have been running this sim at its highest resolution but get considerable hesitation. I can only wonder what people with lesser machines will get. Still in all, this a the best railroad simulator ever. It takes lots of effort and concentration to get a train moving 110 mph down to 30 as required or keeping your freight train from rolling backwards on an incline. I wish Microsoft would have added better documentation for the editor. I guess I will just have to wait for the Sybex book to be released."
2,Boring!,"I love trains, and I thought this game would be a fascinating way to play with trains. But what I found is that it's tedious, repetivie and boring! All you do is drive trains back and forth, and sometimes stop to pickup and drop off passengers. When you're in a low-speed stretch of track, you just sit there for 20 min or so and wait to accelerate. Some of the scenarios are kind of fun, but overall you put up with 30 min of boredom for 30 seconds of fun."
1,Review of Amazon,"This is not a review of the product, but a review ofAmazon in response to their incredibly bad customerservice.I was about to order this from Amazon and then saw a proposedshipping date of more than 2 weeks later. I decided not to orderand left Amazon. Imagine my suprise when five minutes laterI got an e-mail saying my order was in process.Even worse, when I went to cancel the order, the productwas ""shipping soon"" and the order could not be cancelledeven though it has just been registered and still had anestimated shipping date two weeks in the future.When I wrote to customer service, I reveived what was clearly a form letter stating that the order could not be cancelled, but that I could return the product. Of course now, I am stuck withthe shipping fees both ways.This is the last time I do business with Amazon. Since theywould not respond to my request, I am entering this reviewto warn future customers of Amzon's questionable practices."
2,I am falling asleep!,Now I would love to drive a real train but feel this is too much like being a passanger. Nice graphics BUT I dont want to sit there for six hours watching it go by.
3,well not very bad,"yeah its not a bad game,but it doesn't thrill ur spine either.u ahve to maintain a schedule and after sometime it gets quite monotonous and boring."
1,"Bad, bad, bad","Unless you need something to put you to sleep, you can skip this one. Given, It was originally published in 2001, so the graphics could be much better, but in the end this is just a very boring game. Essentially, you get to drive a range of different trains, but there is none of the strategy you find in something like Rail Road Tycoon."
1,Wow this is probably the most boring game i've ever played,"Don't get me wrong I love trains, but I think that this game is just terrible. The graphics are merely ok, nothing amazing. Microsoft in my opinion tried to make this game way to realistic, where it goes beyond fun and becomes a job. Also TS gets so boring and dull after about 20-30 minutes that you will most likely wish to return it. Overal, the game in MY OPINION is a disaster, but if you are a HARD CORE SIM FAN maybe you will enjoy MTS."
1,Very bad,"I could not play this game although my system exceeds the requirements specified on the box. My computer freezes every time I load a game. In addition, the graphics do not look real. It doesnt deserve any star. Waste of money!"
1,disapointed,I would like to purchase this game but I am told it does not work on Windows XP Home edition. When will you have one that does?
1,Buggy software,"I purchased this game in eager anticipation of the beautiful sites I would be passing by on my way to exotic destinations around the world. Didn't happen. I have tried many of the different scenarios and the game always crashes after about 5 or 10 minutes of playing. I've tried reinstalling the game several times to no avail.I am disappointed because I paid around $30 and I feel like I wasted my money. I am also surprised Microsoft released such a crappy, buggy product. I am not at all accustomed to Microsoft softwares crashing on a regular basis. Microsoft is after all, a software company.I will say this, for the few minutes that I am able to get the train up and running it is fun looking at the surrounding landscape."
5,MS Train Simulator Review,"One word...FANTASTIC! I grew up in Glendive Montana, a railroad town, listening to the old steamers noisily chuffing and rolling around the yard and along the main line day and nite, and found engineering the steamers a long longed for experience, nearly real, particularly the Orient Express engine. THe BNSF mountain run through Montana was equally as stimulating. Way to go Microsoft! Sure I could pick it apart...nothing is perfect...but I won't...'cause it's a great package...I am one satisfied customer!"
3,"Meltdown, nuclear style.","No plot - OK; satire - OK; replace all hard C's with K - OK; posit Aztec civilization lives on to present day - OK; screwed-up Aztec warrior working in pig slaughterhouse - less OK; also a union organizer - ?; nothing really happens - less than OK.To those who loved this book, good for you. To those who compare this with Joyce, Burroughs, and Vonnegut, I really, really don't think so. His imitation of them does not mean he is of their caliber.If you like literary gimmicks with some humor and a far-out premise, this may interest you. If you want a book that has a plot and eventually makes some sense, pass on this one."
2,POORLY (as in 'very' poorly) conceived product....,"The volume when played through the internal speaker is 'barely' audible and in no way sufficent to hear.There is NO audio out jack to plug-in wired head phones.There is NO provision to use wireless head phones.The ONLY workable option is to play through the vehicle's car stereo or have a jack wired in to allow the use of wired head - phones.----------------------------------------------------There are excellent products in this area available. Don't get stuck with this over-priced,technology backward unit.OH.....gets two stars instead of one due to excellent picture quality."
2,"No man, but boy.","I love oriental hunks, alright. The oriental can be much muscular than that, and still not so much as a bodybuilder. The models in the book are too thin. But if you love young boys with underdeveloped muscle, it's a different story."
2,Indoor use ONLY,"The bulb is to be used indoors only. When used outdoors, the color film peels off and the bulb cracks when exposed to water."
4,Son loves it!,"My son loves this dvd. He watches it all the time, knows the dialogue, etc. Five great stories a child can enjoy over and over again."
1,Forced to sit through several minutes of previews ... twice!,"The content of these DVDs is great. My son loves Fireman Sam. That being said, HIT/Lionsgate has created these DVDs so that you have to sit through several minutes of previews to get to the autoplay feature. Then, when you select autoplay, you have to sit through the previews again before you can watch the program. Anyone with an impatient two-year-old can imagine what a pain this is. Shame on HIT/Lionsgate for forcing this on consumers."
4,Good Purchase,I bought this for my 8-year-old but everyone in the house likes it too. The only complaints I have is that the magnetic board is a bit small even for a travel size and the colors on the magnetic pieces are starting to peel off the pointed edges. It still is a good educational toy though.
3,Kind of a turkey,"Not bad for this price. The Leia is alright but the ""frozen Han"" is laughably bad!!! Only get this for the Leia!!!"
1,What a wasted opportunity,"What a dreadful waste of time this book is. It must have been sponsored by the Disney Channel or Hallmark cards. It is soo sugary and sweet I had a headache after reading it....and needed to bite into a lemon!!!!! It tells you nothing the PR man had not revealed about anyone. Everyone Mr. Perito knew and met was so ""nice""......it seems as if he did not want to offend anyone...and in doing that has wasted his and everyones time!!!! An absolute wasted opportunity....a ghostwriter may have helped but I sadly think not!!!"
2,Weird fit,"I'm not sure how well it really functions since it never stays on. I understand if it's too big because I have extra small hands. However, it has a very strange, extra wide fit that would not be snug on any normal hand. Everything about it is too wide. It's not even long (wrist to fingertip), just wide. I still use it, but it probably doesn't do much for me."
5,I have been listening to this recording since 1962,"I have been listening to this recording since I was a freshman in college in 1962. I'm really glad they have re-issued this Vanguard recording on CD! The piece was long unknown to the general public. I especially like the use of the counter-tenor voice, it adds a special quality to this piece."
5,"The first time my son saw this, he fell in love!","My son was about 2 months old when I took him from the basinett and put him in the crib. He instantly fell in love with his mobile. In my opinion, the music plays just long enough. If it plays TOO long, then it will just keep him up. Also, by the time it is done, I am in my bedroom and ready to set up the monitor. I like to hear him, not the mobile... know what I mean? I especially like the little bumble bee in the middle with the reflective surface. It gives it the added touch some other mobiles miss.Another great feature - you can attach this to the wall if needed. I don't know if I will ever take advantage of this feature, but I like knowing I have that option!I give this a definite two thumbs up!"
3,"short, but sweet","This mobile is very cute, but it doesn't play long enough and my daughter gets frustrated. She likes to watch it when she is tired, but it stops short of getting her to sleep. If I go in and wind it back up, the sound of the winding startles her. It does match her nursery nicely, but I will probably end up getting something different (battery operated) for her nap time viewing pleasure!!"
4,Laughter every time,"My 5 month old daughter falls out laughing everytime I place her on her back in the crib. She knows it Pooh Time. Also, If your crib's side rails are not leveled straight (no curves or slopes) I do not recommend. My mobile does not stand up straight."
2,"It's very cute, but....","It's very cute, but after looking at it for a while I decided to return it and go with something that was more ""colorful"" and with more patterns. From what I have read, studies have shown that babies can't see the ""bland"" colors that this is made with. I purchased something that was brighter and had wild patterns that my daughter can see."
4,still brings a smile to our son's face,"we recieved this as a shower gift for our son before he was born to go with the pooh theme we were going for in the nursery. 8 months later, it still makes him smile every time we wind it up. i like how the characters are easily removed and replaced. the music does run a little on the short side as far a duration goes and the big knob thing used to attach to the crib does stick out a bit. the knob didnt start bothering me until our son started climbing. now everytime he is standing in his crib i worry about him falling and bumping his head on the knob."
4,Great Mobile!,"I received this mobile as a shower gift and it has been great! My son is now 10 months old and we still use it to settle him down. The bright colors and even the little mirror on the bumble bee are great attention grabbers! It would be nice if it ran consistently (without a windup), but it's still definately worth it. Even to this day my son loves to ""talk"" to Pooh!"
4,Excellent Reference for steps to take for certification,"I am a 25 year veteran of the legacy computing world. My employer is developing a client server system that uses C,JAVA, & Sybase and I need to retool my technical skills, but I want skills that are in demand and I want to know the steps to take to achieve my goals.I can achieve my retooling goals by taking a Oracle Certifcation course, C and Java programming at a state university that will give me an entry level understanding of these topics."
2,The book not well covered for specific certification.,"I dont think any readers will get enough detail about A+, MSCE, CNA and many other computer related certification. This book talked about career planning, it doesnt say anything about what certification is good and what is not I would say buy other book pertaining to your interest, specifically exam guides."
3,Great Book for New People or Career Changers,This book has some great information but is written for people new to the Industry -- I am an MCSE and would have liked to seen more upto date/accurate numbers and talk about which certifications are becoming saturated etc. and which certifications are still rare but in demand. Great overview book of certifications for beginners.
4,Good General Guide to Computer Certifications,"""Get Certified and Get Ahead"" is a useful career and computer certification guide for those thinking about working in the computer field. One notes that the book itself (the companion website was not reviewed by this reviewer) does not evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the 170 certifications listed in the text. Nor are specific certifications compared. One must note, however, that the certification business changes quickly, and what is true now concerning a specific certification, may not be true for the same certification in just a few months. Also, one can not expect an author to plan the reader's career; that is the reader's responsibility. Overall, this is a solid text with lots of good suggestions and tips on becoming successfully certified in the computer area of the reader's choice."
4,DEFINITELY Drive Ireland on Your Own,"This Best Loved Driving Tours Travel Guide is one of the best, if not the best, guidebook to use for planning your Ireland trip before you leave. There is a tremendous amount of useful driving material, it has quite a bit of information,and a number of different driving tours, it is convenient to carry with you or keep in the car. I read about a lot of attractions here that I couldn't find in other reputable publications, and found more details as well. The best way to go...and I learned through experience and the hard way....you want to fly into Dublin and head south, then west and north....and leave out of Shannon...the experience of the City first, with the hustle and bustle is GREAT!!...and then the calming of the countryside and the politness, kindness and friendliness of the Irish people will definitely fill your heart...and leave you with a good feeling."
2,Not very helpful,"Since I was going to Ireland on a self-drive vacation, when I saw this book on the shelf I grabbed and bought it immediately. I studied the book before leaving the US, deciding that several of the tours suited my needs. What a disappointment, however, upon getting to Ireland and trying to actually use the book. Directions from the book itself were not very helpful, we got lost several times, only finding our way back using a regular road map. The book mentions Routes that have no signs posted anywhere, so it was hard to know if you were going the right way. I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that there was not nearly enough information about each suggested ""stop"" on the tours - hard to decide whether it was worth it or not to make the 10-mile detour to check things out. I could have also used some kind of description about the road conditions, such as if it was a mountain road, straight, or with many curves - those things definitely affected driving times."
3,One great benefit,"I can't disgree with the reviewers who point out what this book isn't: thorough, detailed and specific.Having taken two driving trips through Ireland, though, I'd like to suggest that the first time visitor could benefit greatly by taking some of these suggested drives.Main reason? The reasonable scale of the drives. Ireland looks small and it can be a mistake to plan drives based only on how many miles a certain trip would be. It is very easy for a new visitor to plan a trip only to find that they are in the car for seven hours.Go easy, plan realistic drives like the ones included here, and have fun!"
3,Knowing What to Look For,"This book is a wonderful resource with a person familiar with the type of tour and terrain one wants to travel, NOT for the first-time Ireland visitor. One must be comfortable with the road-marking system and road conditions of Ireland, and one must have a decent comprehension of what one wishes to accomplish during one's visit for this book to be of help at all. That having been said, for the person who is traveling back to Ireland because they just can't get enough of the lush landscape and the many, many things to do this book is a great asset and time-saver. It should never be used as the primary or ONLY resource, however, for visiting Ireland, but it does give one wonderful ideas on where to visit and how to plan a trip"
2,Not enough information.,"Not only takes you to places with little to offer, it doesn't provide what little direction it gives in a way to make navigation easy. Did a tour today and would have liked to have seen some things mentioned but there was NO direction. This book has joined me on two trips now. Fair trial. Utterly useless."
3,Way Out Here,"This books starts out a little slow and it did not hold my interest until I had read about 50 pages, after that I did manage to get through the book. I found it to be a little on the boring side but with that aside the book revolves around a lifeguard named Parker who hooks up with a girl on vacation from the mainland. She is in Hawaii for a year trying to regroup from a divorce and she meets up with Parker. It was not a particulary romantic book...it was a just a sort of all right book. I also would have expected a short sequel to this book as with the way it ends. It leaves many issues unresolved. Do not take this one on vacation for a good read.......it will bore you to no end and you will find yourself at the bookstore looking for another book."
1,"Works, but unacceptable performance","Bought two of these. One channel failed after a few month of use, but that is not the main problem. A power supply like this is supposed to be used both in voltage mode and current limit mode. It shuts down if it is in current limit mode for more than seconds. That makes it hard to use to power LED strings for example. It is also single turn pots (the product description is just wrong here) so with 3/4 of a turn is 30 (or 60) volts, it is impossible to get say 5V. It will jump between 4.5 and 5.5 barely touching the dial.The manual is useless, and it is undefined how it behaves when it needs to sink, not only source current.Maybe these limitations is unimportant to some users, but then you could just buy a regular power supply, not a lab supply."
4,Review of Power supply,"High value, works fine. Fine tuning of outputs (V,I) is a bit difficult. The knobs are not detented and there is no fine tuning knob."
2,Used Cassette Player,"I took a chance on buying a used product and I was not satisfied with the outcome. This style Walkman needs to AA batteries to work. A later Model Walkman only requires one AA battery and that one is the best of the two. I bought three like that one and as long as you don't drop them on cement pavement, breaking the housing, you are good to go! The WM-FX290W has a MEGA BASS Weather Band option with a AM/FM Radio with 33 preset digital auto scanning included. This is a much better buy than the model I'm writing this review for."
1,A waste of time-,"As stated by a previous reviewer, this book reveals the author to have a near zero grasp on even the basic details of the JFK assassination- yet there are numerous rather mocking and sarcastic references to ""buffs, theorists, assassinologists etc"" with no basis of reference for why he dismisses all of them out of hand. Short on facts and long on psychoanalysis, the book is nearly painful to read- especially the post assassination world of Ruth Paine which takes up the final few chapters. In the end this woman, who lived a simple Quaker lifestyle, was uninteresting. The afternoon of the assassination police removed ""file cabinets full"" of letters and collected data... what was in there, who did it belong to? Why the author never asked the question is beyond me- and so is this book."
1,Whitewash continued,"While the author sheds some light on what has been circulating on the internet for the last two years, namely the Boston Brahmin connection to the murder of JFK, he treats it as more ""conspiracy buff"" stuff. Yes the people who took in the Oswalds prior to the assassination were connected to United Fruit, Cabots, Forbes, Dulles etc. But it doesn't mean anything, according to the author. Just keep believing in a gang of lone nuts, magic bullets, that kill JFK, MLK, RFK, John Lennon and anyone who threatens the status quo."
4,Nice book,This was a nice read. It was interesting enough to complete and light enough to keep up with while sitting in the orthodontist waiting room or on the bleachers during t-ball practice.
2,You Mean To Tell Me This Isnt A Live Album???,"I was excited about getting this CD because I thought it was a live recording and I haven't heard much of Europe live before. The disappointment when I found out it wasn't live, just yet ANOTHER!!!! compilation by this band. Don't get me wrong I love Europe to bits and they have written many great albums and amazing songs over the years, buy why, why, why all of the compilations?? Just get Rock The Night or 1982 - 1992, they are better compilations than this cheap waste of a CD."
5,This cookbook is GREAT.,"Having recently gone into remission, one of my key focuses is to eat healthier, etc. This cookbook really helps. I know what I should eat, the problem is making it taste good enough. This cookbook knows what spices go well with vegetables, etc. to make them wonderful. You can eat well without feeling guilty."
3,The New American Plate Cookbook: Recipes for a Healthy Weight and a... American Institute for Cancer Research,My opinion should not be considered as I have not used any of the recipes yet. They do look interest.
4,great cookbook,I am very pleased with my purchase of this cookbook. It has good recipes that I will enjoy making. I also like the photos and side stories.
5,I love to cook because of this book!,"I found this cookbook when I was looking for recipes with more vegetables. I bought several books, but the more I make recipes out of each of them the more I realize how much I like this book. I like that the recipes in this book are different, flavorful, and enjoyable. I am always looking forward to the next recipe. The best part is that the recipes are healthy."
5,Delicious and healthful,I love this cookbook. I'm buying one for each daughter and my mother. We all love to eat and we love to eat well which means a healthful variety of pleasure-giving dishes. I am home alone this week and still making a couple of recipes each day from this book because I can hardly wait to try them. As a breast cancer survivor I am thrilled to be actively doing something to keep myself physically fit. The informative reading in front and back is excellent and the pictures are superb. The simple format is easy and clear. Thank you AICR!
5,Left a major impact on me...,"I read this book when I was in grammar school many years ago and I still remember the emotions I felt back then. This is a sad, but powerful book about one boy's trials and tribulations in the orphanage system. Riveting."
5,portrait of child abuse,"Although the story was about Jennings and his bewildering forays into the foster care system, as well as his emotional, intellectual and psychological resilience, the secondary character that puzzled me most was the mother. There are so many unanswered questions. Personally I suspect undiagnosed clinical depression and the possibility of other mental illness. This is definitely a hard-luck family, fractured by poverty, alcoholism, and on the mother's part, an unwillingness? ignorance? about discipline and consistency. I recommend this book as a teacher; I know that children go through this. I grew up in a very stable home with both parents, and with a lot of consistency in my life, so this book opened my eyes to other ways of living and what others have to go through to survive and thrive."
3,Not what I was looking for,"This is a very good book please dont get me wrong, but it compairs to so many out there already.I did read the book in 3 days (Off and on) His life was like my fathers in many ways, I think that was the sadness to the story for me..."
5,It was a very sad and compelling novel.,This book was a very sad book. I cried more than 5 times while I read this book. I liked this book so much that I would recommend it to others. This book has really touched my life. I now love to read now because this was a great one.
5,Not Just Any Old Book,"When I said that this book wasn't just any old book I really meant it. I said that because They Cage The Animals At Night is a very ""emotional"" book, I almost cried 5 times! But I still loved the book, just the way that Jennings Burch, the author, wrote it. He, like alot of authors, didn't start off the book really well, and then have a lame ending. Not Mr. Burch, he wrote a book that was amazing straght through. I don't want to give away the whole book so I am going to tell you the most interesting part of the book, wait a second, that would mean that I would have to tell you about the whole book. Oh well, I guess that means you are going to ave to read the book yourself!"
2,Could have been so good!,"I completely respect Mr. Burch's background and upbringing. I am so thankful that he shared his story. I was just not impressed with his writing. The conversation was awkward and I could not get into the characters. I was using this book for a grad school assignment, but ended up skimming it. Again, I respect Mr. Burch, but did not like the way the book was written at all."
5,Hits home. Serious Tear Jerker!!!,"I've read this book and I feel it's a MUST for everyone to read. There are some hard-hitting, heart-wrenching situations that really make you think."
5,One of the best books I've ever read.,"I had the pleasure of meeting Jennings Michael Burch when he spoke at Otsego Middle School in Otsego, Michigan. The school reads the book regularly as a teaching method of how to treat people with respect. Burch, who tells his heartbreaking, tear-jerking tale of an abusive childhood, brings all that emotion to his personal appearaces as well. This book has a lesson for many children...a lesson that spiteful words can hurt. Many children, and adults, would benefit from this book. Burch makes several personal appearances (for a cost) at many schools each year. Please contact me if you would like additional details. There is also word that the book will be made intoa movie and that Burch is working on a sequel."
5,Unforgetable!,"I did a cutting from the story in the 7th grade for dramatic competition. Later my mother found me the book I read it cover to cover, multipal times. That was 11 years ago and I still can not forget the little boy I never met, but touched me so much."
5,A very touching book,This book has made me realize some of the small things in life such as family and friends that should be recognized and appreciated. I am a younger student and we read this book last year as a class. At the end of the unit when all the sixth grade classes had completed the book Jennings came to our school to speak. He also brought Doggie along with him. Theres nothing more than meeting the person to get your feelings going. We sat and the auditorium as tears streamed down all our faces. This book brought our school together as one for a day. Jennings talked about how he was made fun of and I see less and less hurtful words being saqid everyday. Jennings is coming back again this year and we hope to have stronger results than before. This book is very influential and I believe every younger teenager should read this book. If you are not touched by this book you may never be touched in your life.
4,They cage the animals at night,When I read this book I thought that it was so sad. Each chapter brought u in further to his life and to what he had to go through. This book shows that most people have it really easy and don't have to be moved home to home. When I finished this book I thought that it should be a recommended to 7th graders and above. It shows that u shouldn't take your life for granted. I would give this story a 4 because it shows all of us that u can always be strong and u can never give up for anything.
5,All Time Favourite!,I read this book in the 8th grade and have never forgotten it! The experiences that Birch shares with the readers are exceptional and deeply moving.
4,It's good because the author puts so many feelins in it.,"The book was good. It was so good because of the amount of feelings the author expressed. There was one downside to it though, I thought. The boy was an eight year old, and he couldn't have been able to know all that. Like some of the words he said he was feeling an eight year old boy does not know those kinds of words. I know he was smart and all but not that smart. Thank You."
4,sad yet wonderful read,"not as disturbing as ""Running with Scissors"", but just as sad. This book is definitely sad instead of funny. I really enjoyed it."
5,Touching Novel,This book is very touching. I recomend it to anyone who is in for a sad story. You can see how bad Jennings was treated and how he lived his terrible life. This book is sure to make you cry
2,What a Memory!,"Although the novel does tug at the heart, I am totally puzzled by the accuracy of Jennings' memory and by his extraordinary attention to details at age eight. It is amazing that he could recall specific descriptions of objects, conversations and meals. I teach the book to 9th graders who love it and clamor for more, so for that reason, it is a valuable tool. But so far as its accuracy is concerned, I am doubtful."
1,DON'T READ THIS BOOK!,I thought that They Cage The Animals at Night was a very boring book and I would not recommend it for kids. The reason that I thought it was boring is it was a very slow moving book and it went on and on about the smallest things. It's a book about a boy whose mother keeps putting him in orphanages and bad things keep happening to him when he goes there. I prefer sci-fi and action books.
1,Your kidding me right?,"After reading a great review of Safonique, I wanted to order. The sales link pointed me to Amazon and there's a 4 week+ lead time on this item! Maybe I'm just another impatient American, but this kind of lead time on laundry soap is a detractor for me. Hope to see it in my local store soon, meanwhile Dreft is the answer for my family."
5,Dean Markley PT-13 chromatic tuner,"The PT-13 tuner pedal is a great addition to my gear. It is very sturdy. A push of a button allows for flat tuning, also one for changing the pitch reference frequency. Two lights come on when your instument is tuned. And there is no noise from the pedal. I use it in line between my guitar and amp and I have no added noise.It also provides a mute feature while tuning. Also a light stays on to remind you to unplug your cable, when the tuner is not in use, to help prolong battery life, They most certainly had me in mind with this feature!Overall I think this tuner will last me quite some time. I play live and I record everyday in numerous sessions, so tuning is very important to me. This pedal is easy and reliable. It came to me recommended, and I will highly pass along the recomendation to anyone in need of a tuner."
4,Did they forget to balance the volume?,"This cd is a compilation from other Graham Parker cd's. While I think that the song selection is great, you can notice a change in volume levels going from a set of songs taken from one original cd into another set."
2,"Scratchy, poor quality","My kids (ages 5 and 7) really wanted these sheets and were very excited when they arrived in the mail. But after sleeping with them for several nights, they asked me to get rid of them. The quality is extremely poor and the sheets are very thin and scratchy. They are not soft at all. The quality of the comforter is OK, though not wonderful. Overall, I would recommend that you not buy this product unless you know for certain that your child won't mind the scratchiness."
3,"Love the graphics, but a little bit narrow","We absolutely LOVE the design and graphics! My son was absolutely stoked when he found this under the Christmas tree. Our experience with character-themed bedding already prepared us for the quality of the product...most juvenile character bedding are around the same quality.My only problem with the set is that the comforter is a little narrow. Some of our other twin sized comforters seem a good six inches wider. My son is a twister in bed, and if he just rolls over once, the comforter no longer covers him.Other than that, we love it! The matching sqishy throw pillow is cool too!"
3,Buy more for show,"Bought the set for my son as he is a big fan. They are rougher and much thinner compared to what I want, but my son does not complain. Really more about the look.We use the set regularly and they have become softer over time. Make sure to use softener with each wash.Kids have different expectations for their beds if they must be soft and thick look elsewhere."
2,For hardcore movie fans only,"This game is too difficult for a casual moviegoer. Even if you're Roger Ebert, the questions are inane and the ""chance"" cards seem tacked on at the last minute. After one go-around, you'll find you and your friends sitting around watching all the clips on the DVD."
2,"Idea is good, durability not so good.",I only used mine once. It got ripped up on the return flight trip. Don't know if its the manufacturer or the airline's fault.
5,Don't fly without it!,"We purchased this carrier for our sons car seat 4 years ago. For perspective, we are heavy travelers with 4-6 international trips/year and always bring our son's car seat along. This carrier has been indispensable for us. It fits our large Britax Roundabout, plus has space for a bag of diapers, soft toys or the extra shopping from our trips. We use the back pack or wheels to tote it around airports or onto planes. As our son grew large enought to not need the seat on the plane, we simply check it through as a piece of luggage. The material is lightweight and we have had a few small tears along the bottom of the bag, but we were able to repair them easily enough by ourselves with needle and thread. We just adopted a second child and bought the same carrier again for her car seat as well."
4,Money Well Spent,"While flying w/ my 21 month old son, the Car Seat Cover N' Carry was a life-saver. With luggage, stroller and toddler in tow, this product saved me the additional headache of worrying about the car seat. I used it primarily in the back pack position, which freed my hands to keep up w/ everything else. It's also nice because it folds up quite small and can be placed in carry-on luggage, or just underneath the seat (also easy to store at home/car). I did not have any problems w/ the bottom ripping or fraying like other reviews have said (maybe because I didn't roll it).Word to the wise: When walking down the aisle of the plane, PICK UP the car seat and carry it, you can't wheel it or carry on your back...those darn aisles just aren't wide enough ;)"
2,"OK, Not a great buy","My husband and I searched for something convenient to carry our sons Britax Marathon carseat. We purchased this item because it had wheels on the bottom of it and thought it would be convenient and easy to carry on and off the plane. Number 1: Do not try to roll it down the airline aisles. The aisles are not wide enough for your carseat! We had to carry the carseat anyway. So much for the wheels. The wheels came in handy rolling it through the airport only. Number 2: By the end of our trip (we had only used this item twice) there were large tears on the bottom of it from being rolled through two airports. The only reason why I feel it was a good buy was because it got us thru one trip. If you plan to buy this for one trip only then I would recommend it (but not strongly) If you plan to use this item trip after trip, then look for another way to tote your carseat."
3,It is a lifesaver as long as it doesn't fall apart .,"This is a great item in THEORY. It does not work as well as expected. The wheels and base are too small. And halfway threw my first trip with it the zipper broke and the canvas ripped. Since this is pretty much the only game in town for traveling by yourself with a toddler except a backpack which I can not use (bad Back), I have bought the second one. And if it breaks I will probably buy another because it does allow me to push the stroller with the baby in it and pull the car seat."
3,"Got the job done, but wasn't impressive","This bag was adequate protection for the car seat, but the wheels dont' have a fixed support, so if you don't get the car seat in the bag just right, the wheels don't sit on the ground properly, and hence, roll properly. Ended up dragging the bag across the airport parkinglot."
4,An absolute MUST for the airport,"Although this product isn't perfect, I really couldn't imagine traveling without it.Pros:1. Able to have hands free (to push stroller, hold child, or other luggage)while seat is on your back like a backpack2. Travel case folds up small and nicely - can fit under plane seat3. Sturdy (I didn't have any issues of rips/tears like some other reviewers)Cons:1. It can be a bit annoying trying to get the car seat in it, but it does fit2. Strap buckle dug into my shoulders; tried to adjust it, but wasn't able to make it much better3. The carrier flips occasionally while in the stroll modeAll in all, DEFINITELY buy this product if you are traveling with a child. I don't know of a better alternative and I can't imagine being able to carry everything through the airport without it!"
1,complete waste of money,"I used this on 1 vacation in 2 very small terminals. As previously reviewed, this bag is about as durable as a kleenex! It is a struggle to get the car seat in and awkward to roll and manuveur. And for all purposes it is completely disposable since it falls apart after one use. The only advantage the bag has is that as far as I know, it is the only one of its kind (with wheels)."
1,Not recommended by public safety officials!,"We bought a car seat protector (not this one) and took it along with our infant car seat to the local police station to have it installed, since we've read that 70-80% of car seats are improperly installed (no thanks to the crummy manuals they all seem to come with). The officer who installed the seat said that after-market products like this are absolutely not recommended -- the only thing that passes muster with the public safety folks is a piece of rug pad, which also helps the base grip the seat in addition to providing some protection of the upholstery. Doesn't look great, but it's better than thinking you've installed your seat correctly when it's actually not entirely safe!"
4,Great bag if you're travelling on your own,"Being an expat, I travel from Houston TX back to England several times a year with my nearly 2 year old son. Trying to man-handle a toddler, diaper bag, buggy and carseat through an airport and onto a plane on my own is not fun. However this carseat bag makes it much easier. I have used it 4 times so far both domestic and intercontinental and have been very pleased. It fits my son's enormous Britax Marathon (upto 65lbs) seat fairly comfortably though there is a knack of fitting it base first into the bag and then it zips up easily. If you don't get this bit right, its a real struggle so I just start again. So now I am organised - boy in buggy, diaper bag hangs off buggy, carseat as a backpack or you can trundle it along on its wheels. It can also be used inside-out as a reflective carseat shade if you want."
1,Poor product for air travel,"I agree with other reviewers--too flimsy. It survived the first use (barely), but I wound up with a hole in the bag because it was dragging on the ground as it rolled (the bag is not supported by anything except right where the wheels attach). But the zipper partially broke that trip, and by end of the first trip, the zipper had completely come off the track so that it had to be taped up by the baggage handlers to keep it around the car seat. It might work okay for a small car seat, but we have a larger Cosco Alpha Omega Elite, and it was a struggle to get it in and out every time. I just bought a Safe To Go Wheelie car seat travel bag with wheels (for only $10 more) and the seat goes into it easily, it has a base that's got some support to keep it from dragging, and seems a bit sturdier. I also got a sunshade for $6 that's a lot smaller (about the size of a softball) and more convenient than the Safefit protector."
2,Good idea - way too flimsy,"By the time we had wheeled our Britax Roundabout from the parking lot to the check in desk at the airport the fabric at the bottom of the bag already had two holes in it!The flaw in the design is that there are only two wheels. The mistake we made was that we thought we had it angled so that only the wheels were on the ground when in fact we had to too vertical and the fabric was rubbing on the ground too. This resulted in two holes in a very short amount of time. If you make sure that only the wheels and nothing else are touching the ground then you might still have an intact bag at the end of your flight. but the material is way too flimsy and the slightest mistake on your part will result in holes. We have duct taped our holes and are still using the bag, but are kind of dissapointed.If the material was much stronger then this would be a good product."
4,Awesome product,"We used this car seat carrier on our vacation - it was big enough for our britax marathon and I could easily drag it behind me on its wheels while pushing our stroller. I also put some carry on luggage in with the car seat so we had less bags to lug around. You can put the seat with the bag on the airplane seat and just unzip and push the sides of the bag down so you don't have to struggle putting the car seat in and out of the bag. At the end of the flight we just unbuckled the seat, pulled up sides and zipped it up and were ready to go. It was a hassle getting the seat down the aisle of the plane because it was too big to roll, so try to get a seat up front if you can. My only complaint is that one of the back pack strap plastic rings cracked after our 2nd use, but since we only use the wheels and not the back pack part it doesn't matter and for the price, this bag is certainly worth it."
4,Frequent Flier,"We fly twice a month on average - no joke! - and take our Britax Roundabout in this bag everytime. It has survived over 6 months of heavy toting - including a 10 day trip through Europe - and after all that the only thing wrong is that the cloth around the wheels has started to wear away about the last month or so. We don't store anything but the carseat in the pack and an occasional blanket or stuffed animal, though it has sufficient room to do so. I have continued to use it with the holes forming but plan on patching them to continue use. I was hesitant after reading the negative reviews but needed something quickly. I highly recommend the tote to anyone who travels. With proper use as a backpack or wheeling it, it will withstand heavy usage."
2,"Wheels are great, one major flaw","I have used this bag a few times and it works well in some ways. My Britax Roundabout fits spaciously (as long as it is positioned backwards), and the wheels on the bottom are genius. One major flaw is that the clips that attach the backpack straps to the bag are positioned so they dig into your shoulders when you wear the seat on your back. It is extremely painful, so I have not been able to continue using it as a backpack. I'm now looking for some terry cloth arm bands people wear on their wrists for tennis, and I'm going to try to use those to cover the clips. If I could, I would return this bag for something more comfortable. In the meantime, we attach it to a rolling suitcase and pull it on its wheels, which works sufficiently well, although it is a bit awkward and tippy. I have not (yet) had the fabric tearing problem that the majority of other reviewers complain about. Maybe I just got lucky with gentle airline handlers."
4,A pretty good product overall..,"We have an Evenflo Triumph convertible seat and I have to say that there wasn't much space for anything else in the bag and the seat had to go into the bag just so in order for it to fit. Also, when they x-ray the seat at security they have to remove it from the bag and you have to wrangle it back in alone. I was travelling from Southern California to Illinois alone with my 14 month old, and the wheels on the bottom of the carrying bag definitely helped me to manage. That said, I can't even comprehend how someone can say this is a breeze to manage and push a stroller at the same time! No way!If two parents are travelling together with a child/children then this carrying bag makes transporting the seat a walk in the park. If you're travelling alone, then it does make things easier but be prepared to wrangle it. Still, it's better than carrying it on your back."
2,"Great product, if you only need it once.","I travel on my own quite a bit with my baby. This car seat carrier was a life saver on my last trip. The wheels were a huge help. But after only one trip, the bottom material tore. There's got to be a better way than buying a new one per trip."
2,Did not hold up well,"I think this product is a very good idea, however, it didn't hold up very well at all. After one round-trip flight it's useless. There are several large holes and the zipper doesn't work anymore. It didn't roll well either, the bag kept scraping the ground (where some of the holes came from) unless I held it at an awkward angle.I also had a hard time getting my daughter's carseat in it in the first place. The Evenflo Triumph was too big and our other seat, the Cosco AlphaOmega, fit, but not without some work.It might work well for getting the seat through the airport for use on the plane, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it for checking your carseat as baggage."
4,Travel Mom,"This bag has been great. I travel a lot with my toddler and I'm usually alone so this has been a lifesaver when trying to push a stroller, pull a bag, and chase a toddler.After 4 trips with the bag it came out of the baggage return stredded. This was the second time I checked it instead of checking it at the plane door. I took it to the luggage counter and they sent it for repair, which turned out they couldn't so I got reinbursed the full money to buy a new one. So if it gets ripped in transit, the airline will either fix it or send you money for a new one. Don't feel like it's your loss.I'm still giving it 4 stars because the wheels are a lifesaver."
2,didn't fit our car seat,"Just for other customers to know, it does not fit our Evenflo Triumph DLX Convertible car seat. But the product itself looked fine, and has a side pocket to put the straps in, for airplane travel. I considered keeping it for the car seat reflector part of it, but the wheels made it combersome for that use"
3,Not very resilient!,"The car seat fit in this bag pretty easily, and I was even able to stuff more things in there, but it can't take a beating from the Baggage people at the airport! When we got our bag from Baggage Claim, there was some wear in a few different places to where you could almost see right through the material. Not to mention there were a couple tears. Would I buy this again? In a word, no."
3,Great Customer Service,"We bought this cover to use for our frequent cross-country flights to visit family. After the first trip as checked luggage, the zipper started to malfunction and was difficult to open and close. After the second trip, one side of the zipper was completely useless and a couple of tears appearred near the bottom as other reviewers also noticed.However, I went to the safefit website and contacted customer service using the email address provided. They repsonded quickly and sent a replacement product immediately.This car seat cover would have worked ok if the zipper had not broken - since I haven't seen others complaining about this, I will assume it was an isolated event and hopefully my replacement will be ok. As far as the rips - just be aware that the wheel function is not so useful because the bag will drag on the ground and tears will result. Still not a bad product for the price - at least it keeps your car seat clean when you are checking it as luggage."
2,Good idea but poor quality,This Safefit bag received 2 holes on its bottom during its first flight and 1 more on its return trip. I'm not very impressed with the quality of the material. A checked car seat at the gate never received as much damage as this bag did.
1,Terrible product - does not fit and does not roll,"Despite claims that this product would fit most car seats we found out at the airport that it did not fit our Evenflo car seat. It was a struggle to fit the seat in the bag, and even then we could not zip the bag closed all the way.Once the seat was mostly in we tried to roll it but the wheels are so small and the handle so lame that the seat kept flipping.We got so frustrated with it that we threw away the bag at the airport security checkpoint and strapped our carseat on top of our rolling suitcase instead, using a $0.49 bungee cord I had the foresight of bringing along just in case.I would give this product zero star if I could for false advertising and poor design."
1,Works great! (ONCE),"We bought this bag to use with our Britax Marathon carseat, and it worked great the first time. We loved the wheels, since our seat is quite heavy. It really is a great concept. However, it is a terrible product! The second time we used it, we noticed that the seat slid around in the bag a lot, causing it to tip off the wheels and drag on the ground. At the end of our trip, not only did this dragging cause the bag to rip on the way to our car, but it ripped our car seat! The bag's fabric is pretty flimsy, so for our third trip with this bag, I reinforced the whole bottom of the bag with heavy duty iron on patches. Thankfully, this got us through that vacation and at least to our car. When I unzipped the bag to remove the seat, the zipper pull came right off! I would recommend spending money on a bag that you carry, especially if you really like your carseat."
4,Very Handy,"I have only used this once, with an infant carrier and base. It all fit in there, along with some toys and blankets. It was very akwardly shaped, but when you can only have so many bags on a flight...this was a God send! I plan on using it this week, and hopefully our Britax Marathon will fit, with some room for other stuff:) I would buy this again. Its only been used once, but looks brand new."
1,Not Sturdy or Durable at All!,"After spending over $30 for this item, we used it only twice and it ripped on the bottom clear across. A seamstress said it could not be repaired and commented that the fabric was not very durable or strong. Would not purchase again or recommend to others."
1,Cover 'n Carry Falls Apart,"After one trip (4 flights)with this cover it had several small holes and one zipper fell off. It was only used to carry on the car seat, so it was never checked as baggage, therefore, not overly handled. Very disappointing and on the final flight I didn't even use it because of the zipper. Save your $30 and buy a regular luggage carrier."
3,Used once and it tore!,We used this once on a trip to Hawaii and when we arrived it already had a tear on the bottom of the bag. It wasn't so big that we couldn't use it on the way home and can probably be fixed.It served its purpose though but don't know it I would purchase again.
1,Poor design and construction,"We had this bag, the zippers broke after just two uses and the edge drags on the ground when wheeled, which made the fabric rip."
2,Ripped after one trip,"Like several other reviewers, our cover ripped after one trip. It's easy to see why, if you use the wheels and handle (exactly as they're designed to be used!), the bottom of the case drags on the ground. There is no reinforcement along the bottom, and the thin canvas (think windbreaker) ripped.Though I do have to say that I contacted the company and they promised to send a new one right out, without requiring me to return the ripped one. That was great, though I'm hesitant to plan to use it again. Maybe this can just be a disposable cover, one-use only?"
3,So so,"OK, so this product DOES make transporting your carseat in the airport very convenient. It has wheels, so you can pull it, and a shoulder strap for carrying. BUT, after flying to our destination, we discovered a hole that had been worn in the bottom. This is after one-time use, and we carried it on, we didn't check it with our luggage. (This was before I discovered that my three year old didn't need a carseat on the plane. I would recommend checking your seat, it's so much easier). So on our return trip, we checked our seat, but because we had removed the base from the seat, we lost the connecting rod through the hole in the bottom of the bag. So, all in all, having a carseat bag is very useful, but I wouldn't recommend this one."
1,Broke after just one plane ride,OK traveling to the US form Europe I thought this would be a great item. After just wheeling it through the airport the bottom developed a hole. The second leg of the trip a zipper broke. The next leg and the other zipper broke leaving it useless. For the return trip I put 4 hefty cinch sacks over the seat and that worked better!
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Some Culture related stories. Pretty much eminently skippable. This is quite disappointing. I would only get this lot if you get it second hand or really cheap, and nothing of any note at all that I can remember. Definitely give it a miss and read one of the Culture novels instead.State of the Art : Road of Skulls - Iain M. BanksState of the Art : A Gift from the Culture - Iain M. BanksState of the Art : Odd Attachment - Iain M. BanksState of the Art : Descendant - Iain M. BanksState of the Art : Cleaning Up - Iain M. BanksState of the Art : Piece - Iain M. BanksState of the Art : The State of the Art - Iain M. BanksState of the Art : Scratch - Iain M. BanksBumpy.2 out of 5Talking smoking gun.3 out of 5Loves me, loves me not.2.5 out of 5Sentimental suit.3.5 out of 5Wrong delivery.3 out of 5Religion rubbish.2.5 out of 5Terran grass is greener.3.5 out of 5Fast rant.2.5 out of 5"
2,Not his best,I have been a great fan of Banks for many years and have read nearly everything he has written. I will say I am usually not a fan of short stories and held off reading this one. I finished it last week and was disapointed.It had the feel of a collection of earlier works that was published later because of the author's popularity. I found the stories to be unsatisfying and almost incomplete.We also get a good look at the social leanings of the author. his message seemed more important that the stories.I would skip this one.
2,Smell Of The Fart...,"If you've never read an Iain Banks book, don't start with this one. If you've become a ""Culture"" fan from other books by Banks, then this may offer some early insight into the ""Culture"". The story itself is dull and dated. The charatures thin and, at times, silly. The other short stories in this collection are best left unread. Don't get me wrong, I loved other books by Banks such as ""Player of Games"" and ""Use of Weapons"", but this early collection wasn't worth the effort."
1,Not as advertised,"I just received my copy of the paperbook verson of this book from the book depository ltd and it does NOT contain the lengthy essay ""A Few Notes on the Culture"" which was the main reason that I bought the book in the first place. I am very disappointed!"
3,Thoughts on The State of the Art,"As a collection of short stories, The State of the Art is a good read. There are some very engaging and fun stories, but some were a little abstract and confusing."
5,A Great Collection.,"It's a great collection. Maybe some of the stories are alittle artsy and hard to access, and the novella State of the Art is less a plot driven edge of your seat adventure, and more the musings and meditations on humanity, interventionism, determinism, and aliens (and it's pretty predictable, really). But, even still, I do love it, and plan on rereading it again and again."
1,Nexxtech and Circuit City Sucks!,"I bought this item brand new at circuit city and it began to skip/jam after it warmed up, about an hour or two into a movie. It is worthless, and not worth the 30 bucks I spent on it! Circuit City was awful because they refused to take it back, they said I had to go through the manufacturer but gave me no way to contact the manufacturer. My advice...stay away from both nexxtech AND Circuit City!"
2,An Introduction to Error Correcting Codes with Applications,"Overall it is a well-organized book. It gives a basic understanding of the practical error-correcting codes and the mathatical principles that they rely on. It answers question like how digital information are transfer. My only reservation to totally recommending this book is the price. It is very expensive probably due to the volume they are able to sell. It is a book for senior undergraduate or possibly first year grad school so you won't see it as often as your 1st year Calculus Text. I also had a difficult time locating this book because the publisher print in low volume. So if you must buy this book, buy it early.Table of Contents:Introduction and Fundamentals, Finite Fields, Linear Codes, Some Special Linear Codes, Cyclic Codes, BCH Codes and Bounds for Cyclic Codes, Error Correction Techniques and Digital Audio Recording."
2,Doesnt taste good and i love ginger,"Doesnt taste good and I love ginger. I even grated some ginger to add to it and it didnt help the flavor. With that said, if you want to try it for cheap, ""Big Lots"" has it for less than $2 a box."
1,"A ""hint"" of ginger is right","Well the hint is very subtle, for as yet I have not found much of any taste of ginger. Mostly is is orange. If you are looking for a real ginger taste, get something else. This is misleading labeling and advertising"
3,Ginger Tea is Good Medicine,"If you have allergies or sinus problems, try a cup of hot ginger tea. It will help. This is a nice tea, especially if you throw in a few thin slices of fresh ginger for a double whammy. It clears you right up."
3,Letters,"A useful book for anyone who doesn't often write letters, some useful templates. Not so useful for experienced office / business workers"
4,"Mohsen, WA, Australia",an excellent book for what it claims to be; but I wish it had some introduction on how to format letters as well (I suppose that's what you'd expect from a book of letters anyway).
1,Not a practical choice,Too much of personal letters not much variety of bussiness letters. Very simple choice of words. I could'nt use it at all
2,Not what I was expecting...,I could have written this book myself. The letters are very general and you can find them for FREE on the Internet!
1,Stephen's mom's review,"I bought this for my son to play with when we moved into our new house. He loved playing with it. The only problem is from the time we took it out of the box, we couldn't make the legs stand up. They will not connect to the table. Several people have tried to get it to work and have not been able to. He has to play with it on the floor without the legs."
1,poor work man ship,"The Lego Table 3125 one leg fits fine on the table. The other leg does not. When our grandson plays with it and wants to move the table, the leg falls off and so do all of the lego blocks. I am v ery unhappy with this purchase. I have called Lego and they suggested that I write you to see if you could help me. If not, I am to call them back. Waiting for your reply.C. Jean Jeffus"
4,One Smart Guy,"5 Stars based on the understanding that this is an impromptu conversation filmed on the spot.Dan Aykroyd has always presented himself as intelligent as well as funny.And one would assume that, given his on camera involvement with the topic, that he would be very informed.This fascinating interview astonishes none-the-less as he weaves many layers of information, history, andideas to make some extremely credible statements.I am new to this topic having researched seriously for only about a year but I learned a great deal in an hour and a half from Aykroyd."
3,Ok for people new to the UFO subject,I was a little disappointed with this DVD. It is well made and I enjoyed Dan Aykroyd's comment's but if you are looking for brand new outstanding footage of UFOs this DVD does not have enough value for my money. Some of the clips were repeated far too often when lots of newer clips could have been shown. The inclusion of the Billy Meier photos was another disappointment as this slights the credibility of the other excellent footage in my opinion.
4,UFOs taken seriously,"This is a no-holds-barred documentary about the UFO phenonmenon. Dan Akroyd proves that he is more than a talented actor, he is a real person who is willing to put his career on the line to share what he has experienced. My only comment is that I would have preferred more of Dan's own experience. UFO buffs, this is a good one."
3,interesting,"i thought this was an interesting and enjoyable dvd. i do believe sereda was way over patronizing in comparing dan with einstien or he has a great mind. basically, the interview discussed dan's opinions on various ufo topics. opinions that most of us share anyway. he doesn't offer anything new or insightful. the video clips were good, though they tended to use the same clips over and over again. this dvd has it's heart in the right place and is a good beginners dvd. but, if you have researched the field and are well read, this release doesn't offer anything new."
3,Nothing too spectacular,I was kind of disappointed. I'm a big UFO afficionado and this DVD didn't have anything new. It seemed to be just a rehash of the same old UFO theories and major sightings - just coming from the mouth of Dan Aykroyd.
2,I Fell Asleep,"Besides watching Dan smoke cigarettes, there's not a whole lot new here. No real evidence, just conjecture and ""ooga booga."" I fell asleep."
5,GREAT FOOTAGE!!!!,This video has some of the most compelling footage seen to date. A must have for all those who are fascinated by the UFO phenomenon.
2,Unplugged A Definite Smash Hit,"I was quite impressed with the high quality caliber of this production. The sounds, camera work, the great UFO footages. UFO reality was enhanced by the testimony of astronaut Gordon Cooper who saw with his own eyes a fleet of flying saucers in formation closeup while in his military Jet and Cooper tells of his cameramen at Edwards AFB filming a flying saucer landing on the dry lake bed with its landing gear extended. Cooper says he saw this saucer on the film before it was shipped out to the pentagon. The reality of men in black was strengthen by Dan Aykroyd's chilling account of his own run in with the MIBs, a scary account I never heard about Aykroyd before. And the addition of new NASA shuttle footage it all sums up to a high recommendation to everybody that something strange is going on and it all needs to be investigated. This DVD is definitely five stars."
2,"Good, but don't expect them to last","Purchased a pair six months ago. One died last week. Don't imagine the other has much longer to go. Otherwise a very good pair - when I need to walk in the middle of the night, not too much light that my pupils dilate, not too little light that I walk into things. Bulb not replaceable, so once it's dead, it's dead."
3,Disappointing ending,"This book was absolutely engrossing for about the first 3/4 of the way through. Then it seemed like the author just got tired of the story and wrapped it up as quickly as possible ignoring the plot-line up until then. I was so disappointed by this book -- in fact, I almost felt cheated!"
2,Iles first disappointing novel,"As a huge fan of all of Iles prior novels, I was hugely disappointed with his latest effort. Given his prior work, I can only hope that this is not an indication of what is too come. Hopefully, the attention from Hollywood has not put an end to an immensely entertaining author."
2,Very disappointed!,"I am a huge fan of Mr. Iles, but this book was a big disappointment. I am afraid he is going the way of ""selling out"" to make production deadlines. I bought the book because the reserve list at the library was LONG and I knew I could pass it on to others. After my husband and I read the book, I donated it to the local library because I could not recommend it to anyone. I am from Mississippi and have been proud to read and own ALL of the other books he has written. This was such a disappointment. Come on Greg, get back to the good stuff! Don't become the next Danielle Steele, cranking them out to make money."
2,Glad I didn't read this one FIRST of Iles' work,"I ""discovered"" Greg Iles last summer with his captivating and most creative ""24 Hours"" and could hardly wait to read more of his work. Soon found ""The Quiet Game"" and was captivated by it as well. When I found that ""Sleep No More"" was also set in Natchez, I eagerly pounced on it. I was pleased with the set-up and the rather wierd and offbeat plot line; was initially titillated and then only slightly put off by some of the lurid sexual content; and was actually anticipating a slam-bang of a finish. Wow, what a super disappointment! It looked to me like Greg realized that he had only 20 pages left and had to wrap things up and had little or no imagination left. Sometimes I find myself giving a book a ""standing ovation"" when I finish it - - - darn it, I wanted to throw this one over the backyard fence after finishing it. I won't give up on Greg Iles though. I am glad that this wasn't my FIRST novel by him - - otherwise I would likely read him no more."
2,Starts Well....,"I started out enjoying this book, much like any other Greg Isles book. The plot line is interesting and keeps the book in your hands. But the ending became a bit too exhausting and a bit too fantasy.A good book, but my advice would be, don't let this be your first Greg Isles book."
2,A disappointment for this Greg Iles fan,"Because I didn't recall that any of Iles' other novels were about the supernatural, I kept expecting this mystery to have a real-life explanation. I wasn't sure what genre the book belonged to -- straight thriller or fantasy -- so I kept hanging on throughout this sluggish, repetitive novel to its disappointing end to find out. I felt no sympathy or empathy for any of the cardboard characters, and really didn't care what happened to them. There wasn't even much of the wonderful Natchez atmosphere I've always enjoyed in his other books. I hope Iles soon gets back to the kind of writing I've come to expect from him."
1,This book made me uncomfortable,"I didn't like this book at all. First off, its more like science fiction than a mystery/thriller. Second, I did not like the way the author projected views on abortion. It made me uncomfortable to read the book. I do not wish to explore controversial topics while reading for pleasure. Additionally, the sexual stories made me uncomfortable. To sum it up, I did not empathize with any of the characters and it made it difficult to care what actually happened to them. This books was just too far-fetched in every respect to be interesting or enjoyable."
1,Halfway finished and I can't take any more!,"It's going in the charity box, and the fact that I wasted a few hours of my life on this boring, predictable, novel pains me more than the wasted eight dollars. I was impressed with his descriptions of Natchez, where I've lived, but that's about it.This was my first Greg Iles book, and will probably be my last. Spit on me once, shame on you . . . etc., and there are too many good books out there."
1,"Started Boring, Improved in the Middle, Ended Bad.",I did not like this book at all. It took me 2 weeks to get through the first 70 boring pages. This book goes nowhere fast. Once it did get going there was some real potential. I zipped through the rest of the book. I was shocked this booked ended so silly. What a waste of time. This book was bizarre but not good. I would have given it more stars but the beginning was so slow and the end was such a let down that I did not have the heart to lie.
1,pure garbage,"I am one of those people who always finish a book when I start it. I had been looking forward to this one because I have ewnjoyed the author's previous books, particularly the early ones. I have rarely come accross such a piece of nonsense and am heartily sorry that this book might because the author has had many prior successes. What a sell-out!"
1,Ho Hum - Don't Bother,"As a Greg Iles fan I'm doubly disappointed with this trite novel. It concerns basically unlikable two-dimensional people, it takes forever to get going, and when it does - it's dull! This sort of yarn has been told many times and this version seems tired. He's stuck with a few loose ends at the end of the tale, and wraps them up a couple of paragraphs which make no sense at all."
2,SLEEP NO MORE,"THIS IS FIFTH BOOK I'VE READ BY GREG ILES. LOVED ALL BUT THIS ONE. STARTED TO QUIT HALFWAY THROUGH BOOK, BUT DID FINISH IT. I RECOMMEND ANY OF HIS BOOKS BUT THIS ONE."
5,1st time to read a Greg Iles Novel and won't be the last !!!,I received this book as Christmas gift. Once I started I couldn't put it down. This is the first book I've read by this author and now I'm going back to read his previous novels. This book keeps you intrigued the whole time. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. Just when I thought I had it figured out along came another twist. I highly recommend this book to thrill-seekers!
4,Good story with a slow beginning,"I read ""Dead Sleep"" by Greg Iles, and I do have to say that it was better than this one. The characters and plot are very strong, but I had to wait a little while before the story really became thrilling. John Waters lives in Louisiana with his with and daughter, and he was in love with a girl who died ten years ago, Mallory Candler. When he sees an attractive woman mouth something to him one day, he is suddenly plunged back in time, 20 years. He sees and feels Mallory in this woman, and when things become too strange, the secrets become more threatening..."
4,Good Ride,"Greg Iles is one of my new favorite authors! I could not put down this book. It was fantastic. I wasn't sure if I could buy the ""supernatural"" side of the story but I was won over. I can't wait to pick up more books by this author."
1,Not worth the time to read,"Disappointing. That sums it up. Story seems to be a psycho-sexual knock off of ""Fallen"" and doesn't even come close to engaging the reader. First few chapters are sluggish, and the storyline just doesn't come off being anything other than the author's fantasies being peddled as fiction. Don't waste your time on this."
2,Did I buy the wrong book?,"First, I want to say how much I LOVE Greg Iles. I have read many of his books (The Quiet Game, 24 Hours, Mortal Fear & Dead Sleep). He is an AMAZING writer, very good at suspense. This book confused me. I found that I couldn't concentrate. I was trying to figure out if it was all a hoax (the main plot--the ""dead"" ex-girlfriend) or if I should just roll with the punches. I was very surprised as to how much sexual content this book contained - no, I am not a prude.I just finished this book today, and if I had to sum up my comments in a word - that word would be disappointed. While reading the book I came up with numerous endings (in my head) none of which happened. I think this book could have definately ended better. And I think I prefer a good old fashioned Murder Mystery. I just didn't get what he was trying to accomplish with this book. I will continue to buy his books, hoping to get a clue:)"
5,Couldn't put it down,"I won't give 5 stars to a book unless it's one that I just can't stand to put down - this one falls in that category.I've now read several Greg Iles books, and he is definitely at the top of my favorite authors list.This is a mix of mystery and supernatural thriller. Definitely not sorry I made the purchase for my Kindle.Great book."
5,Suspenseful,"I enjoy Greg Iles' books. He is one of the best suspense writers I've read. This one has an unusual serial killer. I have a hard time putting down a Greg Iles book until I've finished it, especially this one."
2,Not my favorite Iles!,"Greg Iles has been one of my favorite authors. However, this one totally disappointed me. I hated the fact that the protagonist was so wrapped up in his prior ""love life"" that he couldn't recognize the worth of his present marriage. I do not wish to give too much away, but his whole story-line was ridiculous. Unless I am reading science fiction, I hate for anauthor to go beyond the realm of reality. Sorry. Iles prefaced his book with a thank you and an apology. He stated that he appreciated the fact that his readers let him delve into unchartered waters...that he could experiment with new topics. Greg, this just didn't make it for me. It was a tiresome, long-lasting read. I'm glad I'm done. It became a chore."
3,disappointed,I have read other Iles books which were not only more interesting but could not put down - this book I couldn't wait to finish
2,Jarring departure,"I found this to be a jarring departure from Iles' books where Penn Cage is the main character. I thought I had signed on for another interesting mystery, not a supernatural book. It was like an adult ""Twilight."" Blech."
1,Hated it,I've read a lot of Greg Iles' books and this is by far the WORST!! I love keeping books so I can pass them along to others or simply add to my collection. This one...I actually threw it in the trash when I finally finished reading it.
3,Hmmm....,"Being a big Greg Isles fan, I must admit that I never expected the story to take the turn it did. I don't want to give anything away but the author really did move in a different direction and I'm sincerely not sure if I am disappointed or not. Either way, the resolution surprised me (whch, for me, is always a good thing). I enjoyed this novel and raced through it - extremely easy read - filled with a number of ""the plot thickens"" moments. Unusual, a little weird and even disconcerting at times. A tad repetitive in the last third but still most certainly worth reading."
2,childish pap,"I enjoy Mr. Iles books very much which is why I bought every one I could find. I am almost finished with this book, having about 100 pages to go and I don't know if I'm going to finish it. It started out with a good premise but has turned into an uninteresting bit of pap. Mr. Iles should leave this genre up to Mr. King and stick to what he knows best."
3,Aaarrgghh!!,"The description sounded good. The book looked good. It started off well. And then came the ending - what is up with that??!! It's the most frustrating feeling when you dedicate your time to a book that looks and feels promising, and then the ending comes and you want to rip the book to shreds and flush it down the toilet. I know a lot of other readers truly enjoyed the novel, but the ending was a true disappointment. I felt like my book was missing the last couple of pages. If you're looking for a crescendo, you won't find it here. But if you just want to immerse yourself in a well-written plot, and don't mind not having a definitive ending, then give this one a try."
1,What went wrong?,"I can't even begin to say how disappointed I was in this book. After reading the other books written by Greg Iles and combing different stores awaiting its arrival, this book was not at all what I expected. To say the least, it was a disappointment. The plot was wholly unbelievable and completely unrealistic, even for a fiction novel. Perhaps the thing I found most unpleasant was the fact that the characters were doing the horizontal hokey pokey on every other page. This story was so bad that I didn't even bother to finish it, which is a first for me. For these reasons, I give ""Sleep No More"" one star, though I am not even sure it deserves that."
1,Sci-Fi or Fantasy,"It was a bit interesting, but only as escapism. Premise of the book is unconvincing. Not to be recommended except to someone who has absolutely nothing else to read."
4,Interesting book!,"""Sleep No More"" was in good condition, though it was clear that it was a used volume. It proved satisfactory."
2,Disappointing,"I did not enjoy this book very much. It starts out somewhat interesting, but never really takes off. There seems to be a lot of building up to something big which never happens. The idea of the story isn't bad, and the characters and settings are interesting, but the events which take place are very anticlimatic. Even the sexiest parts leave you a little ""unsatisfied."" I kept hoping with each chapter that it would explode and have a powerful ending. Unfortunately, it was a very weak ending - kind of like a dud firecracker on the 4th of July!"
1,What A Disappointment!,"I have always adored Greg Iles as a writer and have read all of his books. Of course, I was excited by a new book from him but that excitement did not last long. The book was beautifully written and edited as usual (editing is always high on my list!) but that is the end of the good things I can say about it. To use the term ""far-fetched"" is, well, far-fetched. The plot to me is so implausible that I can not even say, ""Well, OK, I can see where he is coming from."" I can't and, although, half way through, I thought he was going to pull himself out of the miasma, he didn't. I kept reading because I just KNEW he was going to redeem himself but he didn't. Greg, you can do much better!"
1,don't waste your time,"i feel i have to warn other potential readers about this novel.having previously enjoyed iles' mortal fear i was looking forward to this one. but what a disappointment.not only does the story revolve around the transmigration of souls but we have to believe that one's DNA changes when another soul takes over. please, mr. iles, in your next novel try to credit your readers with just a little intelligence.and stick to writing credible thrillers."
2,Not Greg Iles' Best Book,"I absolutely love Greg Iles' books. I've read all of his books except for two, and this one is NOT one I would recommend for a first time reader. The premise made me nervous from the get-go because I had the sense it would not be a 'sturdy' plot and would have silly loopholes as well as a non-gratifying ending. I guess he took a walk on the wild side, but I hope he stays away from this type of thing in the future!"
3,Too far out for me,"I have read two books boy this author before; both were page-turners. This was beyond my sensibilities, however. I should have know when I read a Stephen King blurb on the front cover that this was not my taste. It was well written, just not for me. The three stars I gave it were for the writing itself; not the content(I sound like my high school English teacher). I still would like the read some of his other works; I just hope that they don't put me off as much as this one did."
2,Impossible,Sometimes I wonder why I keep reading a book to the end and this is one of them. I've never read a tale with so much indiscriminate and unprotected sex. Shame on them. If any of this could really happen it should surely cool the desire for sex in these 2 men. A man's worst nightmare his old girlfriend and his frigid wife all rolled into one.Skip this one.
1,Trash,"I slogged my way through Chapter 4, got through Chapter 5 out of sheer curiousity, and then threw the book (trash) in the trash."
3,INTRIGUING SET UP,"I am a major Greg Isles fan. He's an excellent writer and this book drew me in from the first scene. For the first half of the book I was hooked, hooked hooked. However, as the incredible plot unfolded, I found myself disappointed. It just didn't work for me, though most of Isle's books are first rate and I will continue to buy them."
2,Disappointing...,"I was disappointed by the ending of this book. I kept hoping that this would not end as a 'supernatural' or 'otherworldly' type story. I have enjoyed all of the G. Iles books that I have read, including this one until I realized the direction that this book was taking. It actually is an addictive and exciting story, yet not the way I wished for it to go."
2,Implausible,"Iles is good writer, he can put a sentence together and doesn't seem to abuse personal pronouns. However this novel has a most implausible plot. A dead women and a supernatural phenomenon triggered by orgasm. I kept thinking as I read that a plot outcome that made sense or was logical in the real world would eventually emerge but disappointingly this was not to be. In addition, the childish morality play near the end was pathetic - to paraphrase 'Sybil must die to save our marriage because our marriage is sacred'. Sybil being an innocent in the bizarre plot. There were lots of sex scenes but they lacked eroticism and were boring after multiple repetitions."
2,Very Disappointing for Iles,"I'm a real fan of Greg Iles, but this book was a big disappointment. If you like nonstop sex crossed with The Body Snatchers, you just might enjoy this book. But I found it very trite. OK, I admit I finished it, just to find out what happens to Malory, but it was painful."
3,Okay Entertainment,"I liked the concept of a woman's soul or being passing from one person to another. Using the sexual anagle of orgasm adds a mechanical device of titillation. Like a lot of the author's books, it deals with infidelity and the the consequences, which are usually 100 times as bad in Iles' books. Gets a little tedious with the preaching. Good ending, as well as could be. Stupid resolution to the court case."
4,Another Great Novel by Greg Iles,"This one is truely scary.....I really enjoyed the story, and it makes you wonder....Iles is a great writer and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I could not put this one down.....Can't wait to read another...."
1,Sleep No More,"First, let me admit that I read more literature than best sellers. But a year ago, I discovered that Greg Iles told great stories -- not great literature but fun-to-read pageturners. With his latest novel, however, he lost me! Sleep No More is supernatural nonsense with a focus on sex lives of a bunch of poorly developed and stupid characters. Hard as I tried, I couldn't suspend belief and kept betting on an ending that counted on conspiracy -- not the ability of a totally unlikeable dead character to enter the souls of the living! Absurd!"
3,Fairly Disappointing,"I am a big Greg Iles fan, but this one left me disappointed.SPOILER ALERT: I kept hoping for the big 'Scooby Doo' ending, where we would learn who was inflicting this bizarre set of events on our protagonist - but it never happened. Instead, we were forced to accept that Mallory's soul was, indeed, transmigrating all over Natchez. Snore.Also hard to swallow - the big twist at the end where we learn that being possessed by another soul changes your DNA.Puh-leeze!!!Finally, a note to the author - the passages that introduce Penn Cage were self-serving and self-aggrandizing. Please don't do that anymore.I'm giving it a few stars due to the police investigation that slowly closed on Waters - that part was well written. The rest was pure hooey."
4,Great creepy fun,"So the subject matter is a little odd! Iles gives us his usual skills in writing a suspense thriller. It is a little disorienting to read a book in which you continually ask ""what's going on?"" instead of ""who did it?"". Maybe that's the idea. In most books we're usually quite comfortable while the characters are in deep trouble. Reading through this book will leave everyone a little uncomfortable."
1,hard to install,"I couldn't get these latches to work properly. The latch would engage when the cabinet is open a couple inches, but when you close the cabinet all the way, it doesn't stay latched. Maybe I am doing something wrong, but it was too frustrating so I'll pay more and see if the other choices are better."
2,Well...,"These type of latches used to be the only thing you could buy. We thought that since they were cheaper, we would give them a shot. So we installed them on the cabinet below the sink where we kept all our cleaning supplies, as do many other people. Everytime we went for the Dawn or dishwashing detergent, we would forget they are on there and it would get jerked out of our hand because we didn't unlatch it. They are aggrevating, but once you are used to them okay for the adult. However, my little son can still get the cabinet door open just enough and then get his little hand in there and still bring out detergent, bleach and other items that will fit through the opening. We used the magnet latches on everything else. A little more pricey, but worth it. Be sure to get more than one ""key""."
2,Krylon H2O review,"The good?It dries fast and appears to be a hard surface.The bad?The applicator isn't even close to the standard I expect from Krylon. I bought three cans and all three spattered paint within two foot of a paint run. I had to spray a foot at a time, wiping both my trigger finger and the nozzle in between sprays. It leaves a lot of unevenly sprayed areas and a lot of runs.I really needed that color, so I will continue to suffer through it's use, but if I were Krylon I would question if it would be something they want their name on."
4,fascinating documentary,"excellent documentary. as one other reviewer wrote, this is an opportunity to see a perspective from within Mexico for workers living there.Soundtrack, particularly in the closing scene, is fantastic: I wish they would release it!"
5,Sexy & Fun,"Sexy and fun is how I'd describe ""Ms. Taken"". What a fun, quick read. The main characters - Jane & Charley - are people with major flaws. And those flaws are central to this entertaining story. What I liked most about this book was the concept of losing my inhibitions, (the ones that cause us to be too quiet, too professional), and be able to do and say exactly what comes to my mind, without worrying about the consequences. If I like someone, I say so. If I want to kiss someone, I do it! This book took me to that kind of freedom and it was fun! Hats off to the wonderful Jo Leigh! I can't wait until your next book. You never disappoint!"
5,An exciting page-turner,"This book, on the heels of Scott's THE KILLING OF TUPAC SHAKUR, is an exquisitely-drawn account of the life and death of another enormously popular rap artist who, like Tupac, died much too young. THE MURDER OF BIGGIE SMALLS reveals a life style that Mr. and Ms. Average Citizen find jaw-droppingly different from anything they've experienced. This book is a stream of light that penetrates all the dark corners and leads the uninitiated to an ""Oh, yeah! I get it!"" Those who ""got it"" twenty years ago when rap was born, will learn the answers to questions that have plagued rap afficionados since the lives (and potential) of their heroes began to be violently and senslessly cut short."
1,Not what I expected...,"This book was very redundant, with the same facts and quotes used much too often. It also seemed to focus more on Tupac Shakur, Suge Knight, and Orlando Anderson than Biggie himself, which is puzzling to me since the author makes the point that none of the three had any connection to ""the murder of Biggie Smalls."" The book also gives no clear theory on his murder and basically is just a reprinting of the events of the past few years with several factual errors. If you have read the newspapers you most likely won't find anything new in this book, so don't waste your time."
4,had a lot of potential,"I needed to interface with a Minolta film scanner and this looked like an easy way to do it. Scanner does not provide termination power and the adapter didn't seem up to it. Manual on disk said that it may require an external power supply of 4.5-9 volts. I had a 9V so I connected it. It recognized the scanner long enough to load the driver and start a scan. There was a snap and burning smell and all stopped. The part that failed has a 6.5V maximum, so I suspect if I kept down to 5V, all would have been well. I might try another one."
2,What a hassle...,"I have the Ultra Zoom version of this and it's just a pain. The little on/off knob that you twist to record or play constantly turns on when you put the camera in the bag, so you almost never have a battery that you can use when you need it. (you can't plan baby's first anything, so this is useless.)The only way to stop this is detaching the battery and keeping it in the front pocket so that you have to assemble the camera in those few seconds where your kid is crawling or walking for the first time. Sound aggrevated?? Yes I am.The pictures that you can shoot are horrible. Unless you don't ever plan on printing them, then you're ok.The lighting is useless since it doesn't light anything at all. Anything other than outdoor sunlight comes out grainy. I'd prefer ""green"" nite vision clear videos than poorly lit, grainy videos where you can not really tell who is who..What a waste of money."
3,MIU Wood Peppermill iwth Stainless-Steel Gear,"While the peppermill is attractive in appearance, it doesn't grind pepper as I had expected, or like other peppermills I have owned. When grinding the pepper, the pepper comes out in very, very fine particles and very slowly. I am planning to investigate to see if there is some type of clog in the stainless steel gear, but the above has been my experience to date."
5,Inevitable,"Inevitable is one of the most diverse albums I have ever heard.You name the style and it's here. ""RockStar Boyfriend"" is a nostalgic blast, recalling the music from Grease and the Rocky Horror Picture Show. ""Don't Go"" a haunting ballad. ""Say cheese"" a funky alternative selection. ""Fine China"" naughty adult fun.Ms. Mains has the vocal chops to pull this eccletic group of songs together in what is sure to be one of the best albums of the year."
4,"BOYS LOVE IT, Mom says WHATEVER","Whatever makes em happy is my MOTTO - the boys 2 1/2 and 5 LOVE this thing. They drop it on the floor, THROW it into the toy box abuse the heck out of it and it keeps on going! I paid $20 2 years ago for mine, and I'll tell ya - There's not many 20 dollar items that last that long in this house! Between cousins and friends and the 2 boys that live here the toys get used and abused. MY ONLY complaint with this thing (other than the screech if you hold the mic too close to the recorder) is that YOU CANNOT HEAR TAPES...strange but true! You turn it WAY up and you can hardly hear a tape playing. The kids don't care however - they just want to hear themselves anyway! HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEBODY."
2,Grandkids made quick work of destroying this toy,"It would work just fine for kids that take care of their toys. My Grandkids give theirs a beating. This one didn't last a month.Not necessarily the toys fault, but still, just a warning if your kids are super rough on toys"
2,Playback broke very quickly,"As at least one other person noted, there is sometimes too much feedback when singing in to the mike. The unit seams built very strongly and is very heavy (too heavy to be carried and played with at the same time), but after very little use, the play button has stopped functioning on the tape player."
2,Not very durable,I was looking for a durable tape player for the kids and this was not it. The microphone only worked for a couple of weeks. It plays tapes ok but would have liked to play with the other features before they stopped functioning. My kids are rough on toys but not that rough!
2,stopped working,Too much feedback and it stopped working after just a short time using it. Liked it's portability but think it should have lasted longer.
4,mommyofboys!,Our 2 1/2 year old really likes this tape player. He loves all the different sounds that you can make. The only thing I would change is the buttons are a little hard for him to push down. Very durable and tuff as it says.
5,FUN FUN FUN,This is a great toy. My 4 year old son got this for Christmas. He thought it was very fun. Very easy to use and durable. Highly recommend.
2,Terrible Sound,"I bought two of these as we have two year old twin boys grandchildren. The idea was that Nana would tape and send books and the boys could listen to the tape. The sound is so bad, so much screeching and feedback even when using the techniques to minimize it. It is disappointing and I am now going to go on a search for tape recorder (for me) with good sound. I will admit, the boys love to broadcast their voices as they sing nursey rhymes so at least not all is lost.JM, New Hampshire"
2,Not Real Happy,"The microphone is all staticy, so when you try to record something that's all you can hear. You get that ear-piercing whistle when you try to talk. I was going to send this tape recorder back, but with moving, that's just a pain."
5,Big Hit!!,"This tape player takes a beating and keeps playing. My two year-old got it for Christmas and it has been a big hit. It is easy for little fingers to use and they love the ""kareoke"" effect of the microphone. She hasn't figured out the voice warping feature yet. I think this one will get years of use."
5,very durable,I have the older version of this player. My daughter got it for Christmas when she was 3 and she still plays with it. (she is now 10) Her brother has also used it and now my Granddaughter has started to play with it. It has been bounced up and down stairs and even banged against the wall a time or two. It still plays and sounds good. My kids have enjoyed it so much that my Granddaughter is getting one of her own for her birthday this month.
3,Great little recorder but good luck finding cassettes!,I got this for my 2 1/2 year old so he could have his own little stereo/boombox to play music in but that was sturdy and could withstand a toddler.It has met those standards but I have had a heck of a time finding tapes to play in it! Almost no one is selling tapes any more so if you want to find children's classical music or kids songs you really have to look around.Not the manufacturer's fault but something to think about before buying.
5,Great Stuff,"This recorder is TUFF! The kids have fun with the extra ""strange"" noises you can make with it and it plays the cassettes well. Heavy duty and well worth the $!"
5,It's good for the kids to practice talking,I like the voice warper. It sounds great. I would recommend this product to anyone on the list.
2,fisher Price tuff stuff tape player,"I usually buy this tape player for my autistic daughter. She is 13 yrs. old, and she likes to listen to music. I bought her a tape player last fall, the same one. In august the switch went bad, and will not stay down. So I bought her another one soon after. She had this one only a week and it started chewing up the tapes. The tape ribbon get all tangled inside.I feel they are not as long lasting as they used to be.Marie RainvilleTheresa's Mom"
5,Frappe/Smoothie Powder,This is the best smoothie/frappe powder there is. Will not buy anything els and you wont either once you try it.
5,Great Read,"M.W. Bourne surprised the daylights out of me with this book. I've reluctantly forced myself to go to sleep the last couple late nights, not wanting to stop reading. Fascinating and sometimes very, very funny glimpses of an ag pilot's life down by the Rio Grande."
1,"Hated the smell, threw it away","Title says it all. Very thick, hard to dispense, smell way too fruity and strange, everyone hated it and so finally just threw it in the garbage, what a colossal waste of almost six bucks for soap."
3,this pirate did not survive long either,"That's right, this pirate did not survive long either. My six year old broke it pretty quick. The gun slinging action was so much fun he squeezed it to death. Not build very durable. He broke two of these type action figures."
1,lies,"I was very excited to receive this hat today, but when i put it on i was very upset. ""one size fits all"" should mean ""one size fits all"", not ""this hat is too small for half the people that put it on their heads, so hopefully you get lucky and it fits you."" was much smaller than my other hats and looked to be about the size of the hats i bought when touring europe 11 years ago (i'm 18 now)"
2,Very bad quality,"I don't no what is the type of print publisher have used, but it's hard to read.It seems like bad old graphic PDF file was printed on old matrix printer.May be it's reprint edition, or something like this."
4,Looking Through Irene's Eyes,"A short novel that tells of Irene, an emigrant who has crossed over from Romania to Germany. Not a T goes uncrossed in Muller's description of Irene's thoughs. Each flower she touches is thoroughly described and each man in her life is turned out for the reader to see his level worth in her world. As Irene waits to get her German citizenship, she travels to small towns where she meets with her lovers and carefully considers the towns and the men.It is a book of thoughts, more than it is of action. The reader gets the feeling that it was originally written as poetry.I enjoyed the feel of the story and how it moved along. I do not, however, think I needed it to be any longer than it was. A full length novel with the story told in this way might have been too tedious."
2,Not worth the money,"This bottle has 60 pills and the dosage you take is 2 pills per meal (3 times a day). So this bottle will only last you 10 days in reality. Within only a week & three days there's no way to tell if this supplement is useful as a dietary supplement or not. To have enough just for an *actual* 30 day trial, you need to buy 3 bottles at once equaling $42 as your real one month total - all just to try it out and see if its actually helpful or not. I'm very annoyed I didn't realize this before ordering 1 bottle."
5,This book is excellent!,"At first I thought, ""Oh no, another book from O'Reilly that is going to be mediocre"", but boy was I wrong! This book is for serious developers that want to write serious applications that deal mostly with I/O. Ron's style of writing turns a boring/semi-difficult subject into something enjoyable and easy to learn. I was amazed at how well-written this book is. The examples are also well-written and aren't the usual fast-hack'em snippets you find in a lot of books. Ron is definitely an expert in this field and I am very much looking forward to more books written by him. If *ANYONE* is serious about increasing their I/O-bound applications' efficiency, this book is definitely for you!"
5,Excellent book on Java NIO,"I really enjoyed this book, and found it very helpful in learning about Java NIO. All of the code I tried worked, and I was able to improve my older Java IO-based code quickly as a result. Excellent book!"
5,Great book for a very overlooked subject,This is a great book on a subject that seems to get swept under the covers alot. NIO is very powerful but very confusing and this book really helps. the examples are very good and actually useful.
3,Indoor use ONLY,"The bulb is to be used indoors only. When used outdoors, the color film peels off and the bulb cracks when exposed to water. Not a true blue...more like aqua gree/blue."
1,I like Gospel music better!,"There's nothing wrong with the CD, if you like country music, but I much prefer 40's-50's music and traditional Gospel music. If I had it to do over, I would'nt buy it."
3,not all that,"if your just getting started stick with russian kettlebell challange or enter the kettlebell.this is a follow along tape for circuit traing with kettlbells.more for the advanced student, still a good dvd great shots of rhode island"
3,Good but not great,"This book gives a good general overview on fitness and how it applies to tennis. The chapters on flexibility and dynamic warm-ups are well written. However, it fails to provide specific programs which can be incorporated for strength and cardiovascular training. In addition, much of the information is geared toward professional or traveling junior players, and not the recreational player, who is most likely to be purchasing this book."
3,Not very impressive,"A fairly short running album that does not do Mel Tillis justice. Mel is one of Country's premiere Songwriters (along with Don Gibson) and one of the few that could sing very well. But this CD, despite it's fair recording and sound, is composed of 10 songs, with about one-half of them being songs you probably never heard before....and truly lacking the signature Mel Tillis sound that he is famous for. If you're a true Mel Tillis fan, you'll more than likely enjoy this one; but the title is misleading when you consider the immense library of material that could've been tapped for this CD compilation. A few bright spots, including an older version of ""Sawmill"", and the ever-popular ""Tupelo County Jail"". I give it a grade of C+. And as others have pointed out, the lack of liner notes leaves the listener scratching his head."
5,Great Book!,"I bought this book after hearing fellow Storm fans rave about it, and it's true, this is a GREAT book. It goes over the issues of women in sports, homophobia etc. Plus, there's great info on the Storm and it's history."
2,I've seen better,"There are far more definitive books on the subject of reincarnation. This was the third straight book on reicarnation I'd read in a week, and I found it to be the least helpful. While the author covers some important facets of spirituality and reicarnation, the manner and tone in which she does so resembles one of those ""Psychic Talk"" lines they advertise on television, or a discussion by a self-help group of reincarnationists. If you want a ""how-to"" paint-by-numbers book on reincarnation and spirituality, then this book is for you. If you're looking for an in-depth delving into the nature of reincarnation and individual spirituality, then please look elsewhere."
2,Reincarnation for nerds,"Gloria Chadwick undeniably offers an interesting perspective on how the average reader could approach the concept of reincarnation. Calling it the ""best book..."" is obviously giving it much more credit than it deserves. This subtitle aptly refers to the way Ms. Chadwick talks down to the reader. There is no alternative in her opinion, the way she thinks reincarnation works is the only way, as if she has been there herself and back. If you want to be lectured to, give this book a try. It's informative, but I've seen better."
3,Is there any way to call this a 3 1/2?,"This was an interesting book that really fired the curiousity about learning about your past lives but the author never really explains what things mean. For example, there is a whole chapter of questions regarding things you like, things you don't like, and why but no explanation as to what your answers might mean. A few examples along the way might have been helpful. There were examples of other things so as to explain a concept but no real help for the reader to understand their own answers to the questions. I do wish I had time to do the exercises she presents -- perhaps I'd find the answers to my questions?"
5,ONCE A TRAIN STATION NOW A MUSEUM,"A Paris train station that has been transformed into one of the most highly regarded museums in the world houses an impressive collection of nineteenth century art. Cezanne, Monet, Tissot, Millet, Courbet, all are represented in what is now a palace of fine arts.This compact volume (4"" by 6"") presents many of the museums riches - paintings, sculptures, decorative arts, and photographs.The introduction recounts the transformation of the train station and how the collection was acquired."
3,There are better books by Campolo,"I think Tony fails to get over the main message of his book, values, values and values, through trying to be clever and presenting the Kingdom as a party. The reader is left sruggling with the novelty when getting the message over could be better achieved by not forcing the word party over the top of more appropriate words. Having said that, the message of relationship, joy, living life to the full and living Christianity is there in typical Compolo style for those who can overcome the language. Normaly I think Campolo is an excellent communicator but communicates batter in other books he has written. Choose another Campolo book if you are unfamiliar with the authors beleifs and values, you'll prefer it."
2,This one was a mistake;,"I still do not have the correct name of a Baltimore author whom I thought this was.I did read it, and then donated it to a local Book Drop."
3,Jeep Wiper Switch,This switch is not compatible with the My 1984 CJ-7 even thought I found it by searching by make model and year. After a little modification I was able to make it fit only to find out that it is for the intermittent wipers. I would not recommend this product to anyone that owns a CJ-7.
5,Amazing testimony of a life lived for God's glory,"This documentary is a MUST see----The story of Derek's life is simply amazing!...what a life!...if you don't know much about the man Derek Prince I strongly encourage you to buy this dvd. I've bought one for a family member, shown it to many friends --all really loved the story of his life that was totally and radically transformed by the Living God! Basically the whole dvd consists of Derek starting from his childhood recounting his whole life story. The first time I watched I got very emotional because like Derek I came to know the Lord Jesus Christ in my early 20's and know and understand like Derek what its like to walk in blindness---then miraculously come to the revelation of Jesus as Savior.God Bless you as you watch and listen to this very awesome testimony!"
3,Not her best work,"I've always enjoyed Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine and was excited to read The Brimstone Wedding. Although the book kept my interest, at the end I was left unsatisfied. This is a book to borrow from the library or a friend."
5,Excellent training cord,"Love this cord. Have been using it to train my new pup for the last 2 months. Lightweight, durable, easy on the hands and easy to see! I've used ""flat strap"" leads in the past and they can be hard on your hands and a pain in the neck to coil (seems like a small thing but the round shape and soft cord really does make a difference)."
4,A wonderful collaboration,"This album is most certainly a Tom Waits record...he wrote the tracks, and is the obvious creative force behind the music. However, Waits reigns it in some, allowing room for Crystal Gayle to sashay her way in and croon alongside him. The result in an album of love--a realistic album of a realistic love-story.Gayle's vocals are a welcome addition; she can croon with the best of them, and knows how to perfectly pronounce Waits's nuanced lyrics. Waits himself takes his turn at the mike frequently (including a handful of beautiful duets), adding his emerging macabre presence here and there, creating an artistic album that is both commercial and beautiful. I won't go so far as to say that this is one of Waits's best, but it has to be right up there."
4,One from the Heart **really 4.5 stars**,"The music on this album is phenomenal; Tom Waits has created a jazz influenced lounge masterpiece musically, his lyrics are incredible, but personally Crystal Gayle's vocals don't sit well with me. I must say that I like them much better than I did when I first heard them, the problem is, that I bought this album for Tom Waits, and I personally don't think her voice compliments his as well as Bette Midler (from ""Foreign Affairs""). Her singing is not bad by any means, I simply prefer Tom Waits by himself, and there are solo Tom songs on this album which make it well-worth the cheap cost of the album. Overall, something that should be viewed separately from Tom Waits' other albums, but that is not to say that it should be ignored, this is a great bunch of songs, I just personally can't get into Crystal Gayle. But I recommend it to any Tom Waits fan."
2,Range a disappointment,"While the product did work... Even with range adjustment turned all the way up, it only turned on at close range.I replaced it with a GE model that worked much better."
2,Poor photocell/motion sensor,"The wind blows, the lights go on and off continuously. It rains or snows, same thing. If you want it to go on by walking up the driveway, it wont until you are too close for it to be useful - find another brand"
4,Peace of mind,I installed this on my garden light post and now in winter when it is dark at 4:30 PM it makes me feel good that when my wife gets home she will have a well lighted driveway. 4 stars (I wish I could give it 4 and 1/2) because it is a little big but otherwise it is great.
1,Made of cheap materials that are very delicate.,"I had difficulty even trying to mount the sensor because the screws heads were so soft, because of the inferior metal used in China, that when I tried to tighten the screws the screw heads stripped. Then when I plugged in the cord to the sensor module one of the three little thin wires broke. The swivel ball at the base of the sensor popped out because the silicon seal they used didn't hold. This motion sensor light is a typical piece of Chinese made crap. Do not buy this inadequate garbage. If you already have one, don't breathe too hard on it because it will probably break."
1,"Beginners Level, 20 years out of date","Few, if any, are learning 370 Assembler Language today; those looking for a book on the topic are primarily interested in a reference with substantive examples. This is a very basic manual that does not include instructions that have been around for close to two decades: e.g. CLCL, MVCL. It is misleading for the publisher to indicate it was updated in 1986 when little more than the title was changed."
3,Good Assembler Reference,This is a good assembler reference for a Cobol programmer. This is useful to review a load listings for problem solving with limited mainframe tools.
2,Not the Best,"This is a reference book, so keep that in mind when reading; meaning, do not read it chapter by chapter. Secondly, the organization of the book is good, but it fails in its explanations. Lastly, if you need this book for class or an excellent Assembler reference book, get AND USE Bill Qualls' ""Mainframe Assembler Programming"" book...especially if you're using the PC/370 emulator."
2,NOT REQUIRED...,"RICK DERRINGER-REQUIRED ROCKING: Multi-faceted axe slinger Rick Derringer has just about done it all. He was a teen star in the 60's group The McCoys, supported both Johnny and Edgar Winter in their best bands, played on Steely Dan, Alice Cooper, and Kiss albums, created Hulk Hogan's theme song for the WWF, and most recently has released a solid series of blooze albums. Yet he's mainly remembered for two songs...the McCoys' bubble-rock chart killer HANG ON SLOOPY, and his big solo hit, the earphone-melting ROCK & ROLL HOOCHIE KOO. Unfortunately, a lame reggae-styled update of SLOOPY appears here, but at least STILL ALIVE & WELL, Rick's tribute to Johnny, and a respectable remake of Warren Zevon's LAWYERS, GUNS AND MONEY make the final cut. The rest of the REQUIRED ROCKING compilation is, like the title, surprisingly medicore for a guitar hero of Rick's caliber. A better choice is the more conclusive ROCK & ROLL HOOCHIE KOO: THE BEST OF RICK DERRINGER.RATING: TWO BULLSEYES"
3,Another Guitar Hero,"The 70's gave us a number of Guitar Heroes to follow, Alvin Lee, Robin Trower, Frank Marino, Tony Iommi, Joe Walsh, Ritchie Blackmoore; Rick Derringer played a guitar with the BEST of 'em. He started out in the mid-60's with the Teen Group, The McCoys ""Hang On Sloopy"", was with Edgar Winter's White Trash, the Edgar Winter Group, Johnny Winter, and had an outstanding career on his own. This is a good overview. ""Rock 'n Roll Hootchie-Coo"" alone is worth the price of admission, and ""Still Alive And Well"" is *always* smokin'."
1,disappointed,I bought these gloves based on the feedback left by previous customers. I could not have been more disappointed. They felt like my dollar store garden gloves. Don't waste your money.
3,SIZE ISSUES - Otherwise All Right,"This seems like an all right product for the price. Not stellar, but fairly durable (bear in mind these are intended for use as liners, not for heavy direct exterior wear). The one-size-fits-all idea is a problem for these, however. If you have large or very large hands, the fit will probably be good. These gloves will stretch comfortably. I have medium hands, and there is just way too much extra fingertip space going on. This really doesn't work well, as it makes ordinary handling tasks more difficult than they already should be with a glove and liner on. I keep trying to shrink these buggers in the laundry, but that is barely happening, if at all (another plus if you have big hands, I guess). I'd like these a lot better if they came in sizes..."
4,Large liner,"After reading reviews on these liners, I decided to take a risk and try them out - good price for the risk. When I tried them on, I was surprised at how large the ""one size fits all"" really was. I have medium to large hands (not thick) and the liners are very loose. It's not a problem though, for the most part. I am using them as a liner in my scuba diving dry suit and they work good for that purpose. I also just finished a campout in the snow (with Boy Scouts). I used these liners in my Gortex mitten gloves. Yeah, there was extra room in the liners, but the liners did exactly what I needed - extra warmth. I gave the gloves a 4 because of the sizing issue. As another commented, it would be great to have a smaller size offered.I would be very hesitant to wear these solo, except maybe for jogging to help reduce that cold bite."
4,Great value,These are great gloves.They arrived sooner than expected.I use these gloves for cold weather when running .They are just a little big.
5,golenbecks no bum,"super oral history of one of baseballs most fabled franchises. great insights into the inner workings of the baseball organization and front office, as well as player interviews which reveal the real people and lives of the players and fans of ""dem bums"""
1,Avoid!!,I'm an Optometrist and I was looking for an eyeball model to educate patients. What a waste of money this is. It's poorly constructed and uses very cheap parts that don't fit well together. The model is also too large to hold with one hand. None of the parts click in or stay in place. Find another one that's smaller and better constructed. I don't know how that other reviewer could have given it 4 stars.
4,Great Model,This is a great model of the eye for the price. If not handled properly it seems that it could break but overall good quality and accurate. I gave this to my husband for Christmas and he loves it.
2,15 second toy,"Most toys don't last longer than just couple of minutes of excitement. This one couldn't didn't last for 15 seconds. The lid comes off easier than than blocks go in. The only educational and exciting part of this toy is that the lid comes off, and then, only then, do the blocks go in. The lid should've been a lot more secure... Not worth the buy."
2,Not a shape sorter at all,"This toy is not at all what it appears. Although it is true that it is sturdy, the top comes off so easily that there is no way for it to be a learning tool. It is rather a bucket with blocks and you could buy that cheaper or make your own with things you already have. Our 10 month old took the top off and almost started to chew on it in the first 5 minutes of having it so we returned it and are now in the hunt for a better one. Don't buy this toy if you are looking for a shape sorter!"
1,You get what you pay for,"We bought this for our daughter when she was a year old. This is not something I would recommend for a child who is still learning to walk- here's why: a quick re-enactment... Daughter takes lid off toy, gets up to practice her walking skills, falls on the box part of toy and gets swollen lip. The shapes should be just a tiny bit smaller, sometimes if they're at a slight angle it seems they don't want to fit, very frustrating for a small child who is actually trying to put the right shape in the right hole, but it won't fit. We ended up buying a better made sorting toy for about $30 and have had no complaints."
3,not as good as the old cube,It's to easy to just take off the lid and stick the shape in that way when it becomes a challenge. The star also isn't really an exact star shape so it's not as good for learning shapes. It's ok for the price though. I'd recommend looking for the old 4 sided cube.
5,Allstar favorite toy....,"Both of my kids played with this over the past 3 years. Little ones like to handle the shapes and drop them into the open bucket, older kids can name the colors, shapes, and match them up to the appropriate hole in the lid."
4,Great Starter Block,"My son has had this since he was 5 months old, and he is now 10 months. He has chewed on this a lot and it hasn't chipped yet. It is inexpensive and durable."
5,Great first set of blocks,My 7-month old has loved these since he was 5 months old. He still plays with them every day. He doesn't use the shape sorter yet but loves to bang the blocks together. He also likes to knock down little structures I build with the blocks (typical boy!) He is even fascinated with the container. When he starts to learn his shapes this toy will take on a whole new meaning to him. Very easy to keep clean because they're all plastic. Well worth the money.
4,helps alot,"my son loves playing with these , we got them for his first birthday and even at the age 3 he still loves playing with the blocks, although he has found out to cheat! LOL"
1,Jazz in Paris Remixed,This piece of junk is another slap in the face of the Jazz community! The ones to blame are the the Jazzmen themselves who since the beginning allow their producers to exploit their fine art. So my message is: Wake up Jazzmen and Jazzwomen it is time for war - Stop complaining Start fighting!
5,Skip the Intro,"This was the first of the Viking sagas I read and I almost didn't make it to the saga part of the book. The introduction reads as a very scholarly, ponderous doctoral thesis (which I think it was). Not knowing what to expect from a Viking saga, wading through this over-written deconstruction was not a promising start. I had visions of the saga itself being much the same--a chore to read rather than a pleasure.Fortunately I skipped ahead to the actual saga. The translation was bright and crisp, very well done, very readable. The story was excellent. This turned out to be a splendid Viking story that led me into all the others (the Paulson and Magnussen translations are equally good). The Saga of the Jomsvikings was exciting as an adventure story and fascinating as a look at the culture and thought processes of these people at this time (the beheading scene is particularly noteworthy)."
5,Touch Typing Made Simple,I'm using this book to help teach 2nd graders how to type and it has worked very well.
5,Great Book,"This is a great book for beginners. My husband, who is 95, wanted to learn how to type. I purchased this book for him and he found it very easy to follow, and guess what! He is typing paragraphs now. He is thrilled that he can now type correctly and is gaining speed each day. I am thrilled, because the book was so easy for him to follow. You have two extremely happy customers! We would highly recommend this book, and the shipper, because it came well before its anticipated arrival date, giving my husband a head start on his typing instructions. Thank you so much!"
1,Disgusting!,"If you're seriously debating getting anything that says ""sexy"" or ""babe"" on it, for your CHILD, you should never have reproduced.This is just disgusting."
5,Wonderful collection of stories; you'll like at least one!,"This book is divided into sections: Christmas stories about Jesus, about Santa, by Charles Dickens, from classic literature, etc. There are so many good stories in here, and several great ones. My favorites are ""The Fourth Wise Man"" and ""The Second Christmas."" It's a great book to keep handy for any time you're in the mood for a brief story about Christmas or several in a row."
2,"One story full of racism, others good","One of the stories in this collection, Happy Christmas, by DuMaurier, is full of anti-semitism and racist attitudes, nothing I want my children exposed to. I simply tore out this story from the collection. As I haven't read all of the stories, I do not know if there are more stories with such attitudes. Aside from this story, there are other enjoyable stories and excerpts from other stories."
3,"Louder, louder, louder!","No surprises here, Hans Zimmer's Da Vinci Code soundtrack is heavy on cathedral choruses and strings, with tracks starting softly, then building, building, building to the moment of truth.Ultimately, the score is very quiet, as it frequently relies on a single instrument or voice for several beats, making for better relaxation music than the sound of a multi-million dollar thriller based on a bestseller that stirred controversy with the Catholic Church.This doesn't mean the music is bad, it just doesn't rank with Zimmer masterpieces such as Gladiator and The Lion King, but it certainly had the potential considering the subject matter.Zimmer, one of the best composers out there, has set the bar high for himself, and the Da Vinci Code score on its own doesn't stand out."
4,Zimmer is outstanding.,"I don't usually purchase soundtracks, but the DaVinci Code soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is a great collection. My only issue is the CD should have had tracks adjusted for softness from when used as background in the film, as several tracks are simply too soft when just listening for the music."
2,Poorly produced disc,"While I love the music, I found the disc to be badly recorded. The music was extremely ""boomy"" in bass and often had clicks, as if it had been recorded at too high a level, resulting in cutoff.I processed my favorite pieces through Bias PEAK software to reduce the boominess and normalize the music to eliminate the clicks; it was more enjoyable, but way too much to expect a customer to do."
4,Great service,"The Da Vinci CodeThank you you for the speed at which you processed my order, the product arrived in excellent condition and it sounds great thanks again. Henk Wolthuizen"
3,"Interesting, but unsubstantial creative vigor","Despite some terrible reviews the movie received, I found it entertaining and quite faithful to the book. The soundtrack is not bad, but I expected more from Hans Zimmer. It sounds conventional and somehow uninspired. I admit that it helps the movie a lot since most of the themes are quite atmospheric, yet I feel that the movie theme gave opportunities for more creativity. Hans Zimmer is far from his best creations such as ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""Thelma & Louise"", ""The Lion King"", ""Gladiator"" or ""Black Hawk Down"". Anyhow, it is an interesting work if you don't compare it to some of the composer's previous creations."
5,Absolutely amazing...,"I am an avid movie score collector, and a huge fan of Hans Zimmer. After just listening to this CD once, I am awed and thunderstuck by it's absolute richness and fantastic chords. It's quickly climbing up on my favorites list, even as I listen to it for just the second time. I haven't even seen the movie yet, but I can already tell that this music will just add layers to the film.Completely incredible. I love it. 5+ stars."
5,Great Book for Professors Interested in Grading Objectively!,"Although one can never be truly objective, this book is a good step in the right direction. It explains what rubrics are, the theory behind them, and testimonials as to how they can be used. Many science professors use rubrics, but few arts faculty are aware that such cut and dried schemes can be useful to them.Interestingly, if you are instructing adults (e.g. post-secondary), rubrics not only assist the instructor in grading, but also the student in understanding what your expectations are.If you suffer from grade challenges or suggestions that your syllabi are too vague, this book may be helpful to you. It will help you understand why you should use rubrics, but, more importantly, it will help you work through the phases of creating them for your classes."
4,great fun- but don't go near the water!,"This is a great item to keep in the trunk of your car- better yet, keep 2, so when the opportunity presents itself, i.e., a wide open space, you can get out there and fling this thing to your heart's content. It's an addiction, you know! It totally outclasses frisbies, but be warned, it doesn't float- at all."
4,"Lots of Fun Overall, Good Exercise Chasing After It","The Aerobie Pro Ring is a fun disc. It generally flies very straight and very true if you throw it correctly. Throwing it correctly is not hard.It also flies FAR. So, make sure you have ample room, such as a field. We tried playing with one near our house on a 1 acre lot and it got stuck on the roof quickly.Later, I took my 10-14 year old kids to a football field to throw it, and we were regularly getting 50 yards on modestly powered throws. An adult throwing the ring with full effort can easily achieve 70-100 yards of distance.Also, chasing the disc while it's flying towards you provides good exercise.This disc makes ""frisbees"" fun again! Buy one! Find a field! And, have fun!"
3,Great for park or large field.,This toy can give you a workout chasing it around. It flies so far you will spend most of your time going out and getting it. It is fragile in the wind and will be carried away by it. Not the best on the beach. Takes some practice getting the right throw. Tends to get a little wild. Also beware of trees. I got this think stuck in a tree three times and had to get creative to get it down.
4,aerobie,the package makes you believe that there are 3 pieces of aerobie but actually there is only one in it. the aerobie is great fun and easy to play with
5,"A fun, light, easy Frisbee-like toy","I love this product. I remember seeing them around, but it wasn't until I purchased one and threw it that I realized that it was a great toy for even my three year old to throw. I love all of the YouTube videos, too! Great product. Worth the price."
5,These things are fun,I cannot throw a frisbee but I'm a beast with an Aerobie in my hands. Great for any occasion. Yeah!
5,Incredible fun,"I bought one of these for entertainment at a lawn party and it was a huge hit. Don't use around trees, some people simply can't get it that you don't throw these up. Be prepared to remove it from the highest point you can see cause that's where they'll put it.Buy only pink or yellow if you have any tall weeds it can fly into. You cannot see the green one even when you're standing right over it. I have fields all around the yard and it is very difficult to find, even in grasses or weeds of 12"" or so. It was even lost in a mowed vineyard. From the edge, it has very little cross section thats visible, so it's tough to spot.They absolutely fly as far as the marketing suggests. They require some technique to throw. You need to be much more deliberate about it than just throwing a regular frisbee, but the difference in effort required is remarkable. These seem to fly effortlessly. All in all a great toy."
5,Goodbye frisbee!,"I was worried, even after reading positive reviews, that this was going to be some gimmicky product that wouldn't last. But I'm happy to report that those were unfounded fears. This thing is very easy to use, flies much farther than a frisbee ever has for me, offers a great deal more control, doesn't lose course as much due to wind resistance, is durable, and seems much safer than a frisbee. I say safer, because the covering of the ring itself is a very soft rubber. If you accidentally hit someone with a frisbee, there is danger of bruising, etc. But I don't see that happening here. Catching is never painful; even when your throwing partner exerts a little too much force. If there is bad to be found here, I simply have not spotted it. So purchase with confidence."
5,Awesome!,"Fantastic, Awesome dont do this justice, this is the best Frisbee ever. Goes on and on in such a true line and maintains its shape very well . Am amazed at the distance it goes and best part is its soft while catching so no chances of getting hurt. Just get someone along and head to a large open area, i bet you will run out of room . PS be wary of trees"
5,Fun for all ages,"I bought this for my five-year-old grandson to put in his Easter basket. Three weeks later, he still hasn't eaten any of his Easter candy but he sure loves this throwing ring."
5,Get some exercise,"I had my eyes on this for a while, and once my girlfriend broke a nail playing catch with the frisbee, a softer and easier to throw solution was called for. This thing is amazing, it flies...if you chuck it like a cheap frisbee, get ready to run because it goes and goes. Takes a little time to get used to how it handles, but after about 30 minutes we were able to control our throws pretty well. Just make sure you have lots of room!"
3,this is pretty cool,"this product is awesome, I got a green for my son and it really flies. the problems is that it will hang on tree branches also easily:) my kids love to play with this thing in the summer with their friends."
2,Be aware: Only 1 disc is included,"Looking forward to giving this to my kids on Christmas morning. The other reviews are great, I just want for you to be aware that it is only one disc, not three. The picture with this item is misleading - appears to be three discs in one package. You'll only receive one. Perhaps 1 is good enough - let's find out on Christmas!"
5,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT,"Frisby Fun! This little doozy travels far. Make sure and find a park as long as a football field cause this thang flies like a soaring plane! VroooooommmMMMmm! Ah, so much fun eek eek!"
5,Great Disc,"This disc is a blast to throw. Fly's probably 3 to 4 times farther than a regular disc easily. If you think an Ultrastar is the only kind of real disc, you've got to try one of these, totally different, but a blast."
2,aerobie,we received the aerobie in bad condition. It was bent and not a perfect circle. It remains in bad conditon and does not fly very well. I believe it is just a lemon because I have had other aerobies that flew great.
5,"Find the hole in your data, read this book.",For anyone in business you should read this book. The story enlightens you to a new philosophy it isn't business by numbers anymore you have to look beyond the data and see people!
5,"Bright, Cheerful, Melodic","I bought the Aquarian soprano type on sale before I knew anything about Music of the Spheres windchimes. After listening to samples online, I'd have to say that the Chinese are the most bright and cheerful. I love the larger ones even more but don't want to spend $100 or so. These chimes are set to produce a certain melody line which they do without a whole lot of wind. In wind, they are very melodic not obnoxious clanging things. My advice to potential buyers is to look for places to test out which sound you'd like and whether you'd like soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto or bass. As I stated earlier the price does vary but they're so beautiful and come with a warrantee no less, it's worth treating yourself a bit.Amazon had the best price on these which I'm giving as a gift to a special person who deserves a treat."
2,Please don't waste your money,I thought that this would be something serious about a serious topic. Forget it. It's more commercialized-fluffed flim-flam from the pseudo-Christian community that has a goal of greed and a mysterious agenda to both insult your intelligence and to disinform to keep you brainless.
1,Too Hard to Install,"I understood the instructions and de-soldered the old Norelco battery as instructed and got the new tabs in place and soldered them. Not much room to work without pulling other wires out of place. I must have fried the circuit board even though I was very careful with the solder gun. Got battery in place and was charging. The problem was that the shaver would NOT turn off. It just kept running whether the switch was on or off. I finally pulled out the plug. I was indeed disappointed after having spent the money for the batteries, which were delivered on time.Norelco really has put built in planned obsolescence in their shavers. That's the last Norelco I will purchase. All they had to do was put non-soldering terminals on the circuit board and a new battery could have been installed easily. Instead I had to throw the shaver out after a couple of years. The batteries are still good so I have saved them in case they can be used by someone in the future."
2,No info with.,I have been asking for info to remove the old batteries from my shaver. As of this date no one has contacted me.
2,Didn't really do the trick. Not sure if it's the battery or my shaver.,"I have been using Norelco wet/dry shavers for about 10 years.My first one lasted 7 years. It was the first model to use the Nivea packs.After it died, I replaced it with the 7775X. This one died after I dropped it after owning it 11 months.I bought another 7775X. After 12 months, it would not hold a charge more than 2 days. I bought this replacement battery and after installing it, the razor needs a charge every 4 days. I had hoped the battery would last at least a week, but it doesn't hold a charge that long.I am left wondering if it is the battery or the razor."
1,Wrong product for my Norelco,"Although we referenced our model number,and was directed to these batteries and site also claimed ""fits most Norelco Models"", it is the wrong pack for my model. Not worth effort and cost to return."
1,shaver battery lifetime,"The battery retained a charge for 5 - 6 shaves (good) for about a week. Shortly thereafter the charge was barely enough for one shave. I suspect a quality control problem in the battery manufacture, but I can't rule out a faulty charging circuit. I'll try another battery."
5,Norelco Shaver Battery Pack,"The battery pack was exactly as advertized, arrived before the expected date, was not a problem to install and has certaiinly improved the performance of my razor. And the cost was far less than if I had a professional do this."
3,Not a straight forward task - need a little handyman task,"I purchased this replacement battery pack for a Norelco 7886 XL shaver. I open the shaver by un-screw the two screws on the side-trim and on the main body. Then, a set of nickel cadmium recharhreable batteries appears inside, they are seat in a battery holder, opposite side, with one positive and one negative side stick to a metal from the inside, and the other ends are just a metal plate with springs. I used a pier to remove the battery fromthe metal strip by force. Then, curve the metal strip and put the new battery pack, which comes with 2 metal strips already back on the battery holder with the correct polarity (it fits just fine). Just make sure the new metal strips from the new batteries touch the curved old metal strips to make a connection. Then put back the cover and screw back the 2 screws. All done. After recharging, the battery and the shaver works fine again."
2,Only lasted about six months.,When I first got the battery it worked great. It was like I had a new razor. After about 3 months the battery needed charging 2 to 3 times a week. Eventually I had to charge it everyday. It is to the point now (after 6 months) where it will not hold a charge at all.
1,Replacement battery for Norelco shaver,"Replaced because the original battery, which was several years old, only lasted a few shaves without requiring charging. Replacing it was not too difficult. I soldered the new one in. I can't see much change in performance. Still only lasts 2-3 shaves before it runs weakly and the red charge light comes on."
5,cheaper than a new shaver!,"Battery works like original. Time will tell if if keeps charges for as long as original. After 2 months, so far so good. Note, as one review stated, installation is a bit tricky. I cut the original battery out with cuticle scissors. Then bent connectors on new battery and wedged against original connector stubs for a flawless connection."
3,Too difficult to install,"I thought I was handy enough to replace my shaver batteries. I have a solder gun and everything I thought I would need. After one attempt followed by a trip to Radio Shack for some advice and additional tools, I tried again. No luck. I threw my old shaver and the batteries in the trash and bought a new razor."
2,Norelco Battery Pack,"Sorry, but this new shaver battery pack simply did not work out for me. I hate it because I really like that old shaver better than the newer models. I could not get the tabs on the new battery pack to make a proper connection that would hold. After several tries to make such a connection, per the instructions, one of the new contacts simply broke off. Sounds like I am a real clutz, but not so with most ""do it yourself"" matters such as this. I think you are rolling the dice to make these contacts work, but some of you more gifted will surely triumph."
3,shaver battery,Product received in timely mannor and in good condition. Product as ordered but installation is a bit of a problem as connections must be soldered.Shaver Battery Pack fits most Norelco models & others
2,Seemed to work at first but then died,"These batteries seemed to be working fine when I initially installed them. (I carefully avoided soldering close to the batteries an tried to heat the battery leads as little as possible when connecting them.) After a few months they started to not hold a charge and now, after a year or so, they don't hold a charge longer than about 15-20 seconds!I'm now looking for some new replacements and you can be sure, I'll look elsewhere."
5,Works well but be advised ../.,"My Norelco T990 was becoming unusable as one of the 2 batteries wouldn't hold a charge and became unusable even connected via the power cord. The new batteries are fine and my machine works like new hence they are a total success. However be warned, you must solder the new batteries and I had a devil of a time disassembling the shaver to get to the internals."
2,Shaver battery,All went smooth but battery does not hold charge well. After 3-4 days of non use needs a recharge. Vendor or batt manufacturer problem? Don't know and will not judge vendor.
2,Short lived shaver battery,"I am very disappointed with the performance of this battery. After less than one year I am shopping for another replacement. The battery originally installed in the shaver lasted for many years (5-10, I don't know how long I've had it). I expected the same from this battery. Lately it requires frequent charging and dies very suddenly."
2,Batteries didn't last,"I purchased this battery pack back in 2009, and two years later I am already looking for replacements. On a full charge the display indicates 36 minutes remaining, but it typically dies after one or two uses. The run time is getting shorter and shorter. I've had to plug it in to finish my shave. I'm hesitant to buy these batteries again."
1,Why bother...,"I had my 5603x for seven years and replaced the heads once. That worked out to about twelve bucks a year for a great shave! When the batteries finally gave out, I looked into replacing them too, but when I opened the shaver up and saw what would be involved, including the ""time to do it"", (isn't 'planned obsolescence' great!! )I figured buying a new one would be doing my part to help the economy anyway, so ""why bother"" with such a tedious task and risk damaging other parts in the process(and then what!?). It would have been just as easy for Norelco to make the shaver with ""snap in"" batteries (maybe easier!) but they need us to buy new ones for their bottom line!! Hopefully my new one will last as long and perform as well as this one did....RIP 5603x!! If you have the time and patience for such an endeavor, have at it!!"
3,Beware of polarity swap!,"I installed this battery in my dead Norelco 785SX a few months after I purchased it. After I soldered it into the PWB (there's no simple way to open the circuit during this procedure) some parts on the PWB (a choke and an IC) became very hot in a second. The battery itself also started warming up, which indicated a short-circuit to me. To make the long story short, I found that the battery leads were oriented so that the polarity was reversed if installed as a drop-in replacement. I had to un-solder it, flip it over, make leads extensions and solder it again. After re-charging the battery everything worked as intended, to my surprise and satisfaction.I have no clue how in the wold the circuitry has survived the reversed for ~ 5 mins. polarity..."
5,Ideal Replacement battery pack for Razor Trimmers,"Just snap apart your trimmer and replace the rechargeable battery rather than throwing the unit away and buying a new one. Originally when I installed the battery the razor worked and several days later it didn't so I took the battery out and put the tabs facing the back of the razor, put it in the charger and it then charged the battery pack and once again worked. It's a trial and error type thing since the positive and negative are not marked on the battery."
3,change the battery ??,"Along with the battery, make sure you have a solder iron and some solder, and don't forget a small precision screwdriver. My Norelco needs to be taken apart to change the battery, the old battery is soldered in from the inside....."
1,"If you have Vista, beware!!!","If you take a look around, (internet search) you'll see there are significant issues with this card & Vista. Intel, from Vista RTM, has failed to provide solid drivers that are stable.The Ver 10.x drivers intermittently drop the connection forcing a hard reset of the adapter using the notebooks physical switch.The Ver 11.x drivers are even worse. The only way to recover is to reboot the system.Just google ""intel 3945abg dhcp vista"" or similar and you'll see. This is not a Vista problem, or a router problem. It's Intel. I have the same card in Dell & Toshiba notebooks and they all have the exact same issue."
4,Works Great,"Got a Compaq Presario notebook from a local ISP promotion, but it came with a Broadcom wlan. The wifi range for the Broadcom was poor since I could normally get very good signal coverage from my Acer notebook running an Atheros card. I purchased this Intel wlan and swap it with the Broadcom, and my wifi reception problem was solved. Words of caution: If you are matching this Intel PRO/Wireless wlan with a DLink DGL-4300 router, it seems the DLink would occassionally drop your connection."
5,intel pro/wireless 3945,must have for dell inspiron e1505dell installed 1390 wireless card is not good
1,DOES NOT WORK IN LENOVOs,"This card is listed as compatible with the lenovoT60 line but is considered an ""unauthorized wireless card"" and will not function without significant hacking. What a disappointment."
3,intel,"this would have been a fine item except it only works on an Intel motherboard. Since I have an AMD, I am unable to review the working item."
3,Product Review WiFi Adapter,"Product was unusable because I discovered the one I was sent was the Correct INTEL model number however, it only works in a Dell. I didnt see anything that said that in the description. I discovered it when I read the label on the Adapter after a failed install."
3,Not New...,"There isn't really much that can go wrong with an internal wireless card for a laptop...Unfortunately, they have succeeded. The wireless card I got was clearly salvaged from another laptop. The edges looked oxidized and almost burnt.Most importantly though, despite the looks it works fine. Has good range and power it seems. Fit well, started up no problems, and driver was already loaded on windows vista so no driver downloading was required. In the event I wasn't so lucky though, it did not include any drivers with it which would have sucked if the only option I had for connecting was this wireless card.I wouldn't have minded it being a refurbished or used wireless card as long as the sales ad clearly labeled it as so. This wasn't the case here. Due to this, I consider it deceptive advertising and in the very least makes me wonder what else they aren't being up front about."
4,A lot of information in a small book...,"Of course, the book is old, and therefore does not have much up to date information. However, if one wants to learn the basics of semiconductor lasers and photodetectors, it is not too bad, and you cannot beat the current price (<$10) for any new book with similar technical content. The book has mathematical descriptions of such topics as the effective index method for dielectric ridge waveguides, models for current spreading in high power stripe lasers, optical coupling with and without lenses, etc. It does cover quantum wells but not strained lasers."

5,Even better than King Leopolds Ghost,"This is great example of how history can be written and made to seem like a novel at the same time. And not just any novel, a great novel. In many ways this reads like a Dicken's novel. We have noble people involved in a noble cause; evil people out for themselves and to destroy the noble cause.Hochschild, has a way of presenting people from a totally different age and time, as if they were your peers. His detailed discussions of the everyday tribulations that the characters went through, adds a multilayered understanding of not just what they wanted to accomplish but how inventive they were about doing it."
4,Bury the Chains,"well written and informative, this is a great and factual account of the freedom of slaves. Mr Hochschild's ""King Leopold's Ghost"" was a great preceding novel for this great work."
3,A good book with a big flaw,"This is a good book with a big flaw: Hochschild, a man who founded Mother Jones and loathes the Christian right, just cannot accept that the anti-slavery movement was an evangelical christian movement through and through. His obtuseness is occasionally breath-taking. About Wilberforce, arguably the key man in the abolition of slavery in the empire, Hochschild writes that his anti-slavery views seem a 'paradox' compared to his (religiously mandated) social conservatism. He cites as evidence Wilberforce's statement that Wilberforce was most proud of bringing christian missionaries to India, not abolishing slavery. But this is all of a cloth: Wilberforce was in all things trying to do what he thought his religion required. Wilberfoce's own words make plain. Hochschild stubbornly refuses to acknowledge this, lest Jerry Falwell score a point."
3,"Informative, easy to read, but not for relaxation",This is not a relax and read book. I find it more text-like and therefore reading a chapter a day. I'm learning a lot and find it interesting.
3,Made for Oster,Although the ad on the box states it fits Oster and Wahl. It really is made for the Oster. When put on the Wahl clipper the guides are just a bit wider and fur snags at the sides. Nicely made with spring action to hold on to clipper.
1,Does NOT fit Andis...bad return policy,Although the description states they fit Andis clippers...the in fact do NOT fit them. Refund of only purchase price - not expensive shipping. Do not deal with Goodmans.
2,Where's a #3 Comb??,"I bought this set thinking that I would get all the comb numbers except for the combs less used by the public. I got the set and realised that the combs which are included in this set is #0; #1 ; #2; #4; #6; #8, #10.Where is a #3 comb - the most common comb used?!"
3,Expected better product,"I used the all plastic attachments for over 10 years. I thought the metal clip-on attachment would be much better but they're not. The metal is thin and is only slightly better that the plastic. And who needs all of these sizes? I need the #1, #2, and #3 attachments. Maybe I can trim my cat with the others using my A5. Shipping was slow and expensive. I wouldn't buy this again."
1,Not compatible,"I have three Nectron ink cartridge cyan, magenta and yellow and an original Epson black cartridge. The Nectron cartrudges are new and the printer don't recognize them"
5,Hip Book,Fun book! Excellent photographs. Reading about the various hotels from around the world and looking at the photos of the decor made me want to pack up my bags and do some traveling!The photos also gave me some ideas and inspiration on decorating my apartment.
1,Expected more from Fisher Price...,"I bought this toy for my baby who is on the verge of walking. I have always been happy with my toys from Fisher Price, but this one really shakes my faith in this toy manufacturer. There is no weight in the bottom of the toy! The wheels are cheap, hollow, thin plastic. My son grabs it and almost immediately falls backwards and the toy lands on top of him. He just cracked his head in my kitchen a couple of days ago. Please, parents, steer away from this toy. It is dangerous and should be recalled. I'm taking mine back immediately."
3,"Fun toy, make sure your child is stable enough for walker","When I first got this toy for my daughter she was 7 months old and had just started standing up. At that time she played with the toy in the down position. I didn't relize at first that this toy is not for children when they are first learning to stand up. When she became a stable crusier (about 8 months) then she could use the walker part of it, and loved it."
3,Not happy with this one at all...,"My son received this for his first birthday. He is not walking yet but has been ""cruising"" for a while and is quite sturdy on his feet.As the other reviewers have noted, this walker is lightweight. As soon as my son pulls up to push it, it goes very fast and he can't keep up. He will take a few quick steps and then ends up falling to his knees. He has played with the activities on the front of the toy but doesn't stay interested. In fact, after looking them over once or twice he now pays them no attention at all.Also, the sound is a nuisance. I stuck the batteries in and the toys doesn't hold them in very well because the music never plays without beating on the thing to get them to connect right.If you are looking for a walker, I HIGHLY recommend the Fisher-Price Stride-to-Ride Walker instead. For only ten bucks more you get a MUCH better product!"
4,great item!,"my daughter got this for christmas and she loves to bang on it to make it sound! we stand her at it and she gets the idea of it, but she's not quite ready (7 months old). she loves the bright yellow smiley face on and loves to spin the other toys as well. this is a great buy!"
1,Very light and easy to tip over.,I bought this for my 9 month old when he first really expressed interest in walking. Even with constant supervision it tipped over and ran out from under him. This happened to the point he would not play with it. I bought a different brand and he is now walking without assistance at 10 months. This walker is collecting dust in the garage awaiting garage sale season!
4,good toy but lightweight,"We recently bought this toy for our 9 month old son. He really likes to walk with it but it is too light. It goes faster than he can go sometimes and he ends up interested in something else after he falls a couple times. But overall it's really helping him get the hang of walking. Just since he's had it he is starting to walk for longer periods of time. He doesn't like to play with it in the floor position though, it doesn't seem to keep his interest this way. But overall it's easy to use and it helps him get around the house on his feet, just watch out for hardwood floors!"
2,Pass it up,I bought this for my son at the low price of Ten bucks. Even at such a low price I felt it was still not worth it. The only thing he liked was the ball in the middle but he only liked it for so long. I think personally it was cheaply made. The way the legs move to turn it into walker mode I dont know something about it just bothered me. I felt like if I yanked them even a little to hard they would be gone. The wheels are very cheap. The part of the toy that is suppose to turn and has the black and white sticker was crap. It kept getting stuck and wouldnt move! The other toys on it were just the same. The beads had no room tom move. It really is just a cheap toy poorly made. Pass it up.
4,my son loves it,We bought this for my son when he was 11 months old and was just starting to walk on his own. He's 15 months now and still loves it--he steers much better now!. When he was smaller he enjoyed flipping the ball on front and the tabs. We never put batteries in it-- we frankly didn't think he needed the noise as a reward for playing with it. It is not to be used for a child that isn't walking yet and it isn't sturdy enough for a child to pull himself up on--that should be apparent by looking at it. It is a fun toy if your child is walking.
4,My sons favorite!!!,"My son received this last Christmas and still likes to play with it at 17 months. I was going to pack it away (since has been walking for a long time) but he threw a fit and still plays with it. I really haven't any problems like everyone else has. He has pulled it down, but never hurting himself. It has NEVER gotten away from him either. This walker is what helped my son learn to walk. It gave him stability and he was up and running with it in no time. My son found the toys in front pretty entertaining, but now at his age they are boring to him. The only time the music didn't play was when the batteries were dying. I replaced them and the music plays with no problems. I don't have to ram it into anything to get it to play. I like this walker and would buy it as a gift for someone too. My son has no intention of giving it up anytime soon. It is one of his favorite toys."
1,Terrible Toy,"Poorly designed toy. My son likes flipping some of the toys, but gets bored easily with it. I even have to hit it hard to get music to play and the music is why we chose it over others. The lower version can not be locked to enjoy safe, stationary play. A big dissapointment."
3,"This is an ok toy, but...","My son started walking around 9 months. We bought this toy for him and he walked behind it for maybe a week. Now he is 11 months and when he plays with this toy he throws it all over. He likes to carry things around and this toy is so light that it allows him to actually pick it up, then he drops it, the he cries. I think that if the toy would light up or play music while he pushes it, it would hold his attention better than just making noise when he bumps things. All that teaches him to do is run into my furniture and walls."
2,not thrilled,"My daighter enjoys playing with the toys on this, but it definitely isn't stable enough for her to use as a walker. She pulls up easily on stable objects, but this moves to easily to provide her with any stability."
3,Disappointed in SC,"I bought this for my 9 mo old today. I am taking it back tomorrow. He liked it at first when the music would play, but we found that you had to really beat the toy to get the music to play. I thought that maybe this toy was defective, but after reading some other reviews, this is the case with this toy. My husband found if you turned it upside down and rolled the center ball the music would play. Not a very fun way to play with it though. I expected more from Fisher Price."
1,dangerous walker!,"We were very disappointed with this walker. First of all, the whole purpose of buying a walker is to support little ones just getting the hang of walking! The wheels on this thing spin freely and the first time my daughter used it, it slipped away from her and she fell to the floor face first! Not a great confidence builder...thank goodness she was on the carpet! I ended up giving it to Goodwill. We have been thrilled with every other Fisher Price toy we have owned but would NOT recommend this ""walker"" to anybody! We were naive to think they were all the same -they are certainly NOT! Be sure to look for a walker that has wheel speed control!"
3,Tipping over,"This product is cute when used in its lostest position. The play activities are fun. When my son tried to use it as a walker however, it went way to fast and tipped over often. The wheel are very light and don't provide the support needed for the beginning walker."
2,Not strong enough and music hard to get,"THis toy is very light and it often goes very far and baby has to fall. The music option of this walker is very bad. I have to bang it to get the music. Not at all a useful toy. I will be returning it tomorrow. Not strong enough, and not enough value. My opinion is don't buy this piece at all...not usefull as walker or as visual or musical toy"
1,Momma to the Bean and the Bear,"I was very disappointed in this toy - it really doesn't do very much - the only activity that seems to interest my 7 month old is the smily face in the center. The sounds do not play very often in response to his playing. It is sturdy - he uses it to pull himself up and it hasn't teetered once. When our son is given the choice of this toy or one of his others, he always chooses the other. Next time I would spend the extra 5 or 10 dollars for a more exciting toy."
5,great toy,I bought this for my son when he was nine months old and just learning to walk. I feel it really helped him gain the confidence to walk on his own. although before your chld is a confident walker I suggest staying close by because it can get away from them. At almost 19mo this is still one of his favorite toys. He now races around the house with it. For the money spent I feel we got a lot of use fromthis toy.
4,Oh what fun!,"I purchased the non-musical version of this walker for my son when he was 9 months old. He is now almost 12 months old and still plays with this every day. The wheels roll really easy, which actually has not helped my little guy learn how to walk - he pulls up on it, only to continue forward until he falls on his face. He doesn't mind this, so long as he gets to play with the activities on the face of the walker. I got a great deal on the non-musical version and it has more than lived up to my expectations.Pros: Lots of fun for my son and keeps him entertain for long periods of time.Cons: Rolls too easily so my son has had a hard time learning to walk with it."
5,Skeptical,I was a little skeptical when I rented this movie but as it went on I really enjoyed it showing how teens deal with traumatic events in their lives and the support system that is there to help them.
4,Such a Great Selection,I loved this movie. The depiction of a real life situation of a girl who is aspiring to become a major figure in the world and the conflict that follows is just mesmerizing. You felt like you were her neighbors as you watched the drama unfold. The actors were very believable as if this was their own real life situation. I completely loved this movie and would recommend it to so many others.
3,Could be triggering....,It's an ok movie.If you are a rape survivor looking for an inspiring moving this may not be for you.
1,Bad Movie,"This was a very low budget movie, poorly made, you could tell that from the start, they put no effort into making this movie"
1,black butterfly,"I'm sure the movie was good, but I was too angry about the swimming. I swam for 18 years at a competitive level and I am wondering if the movie producer even researched what good swimming looks like or how one qualifies for the Olympic team. Ariel was not a good swimmer formwise and you don't get asked to ""try out"" for the Olympics. Other than that the movie was good but I couldn't get past the fact that the movie producer clearly had no idea what swimming actually is....if you're going to make a movie like this at least research the sport!!!"
3,"Editing errors, unusual edition","This is a review not of the story, which is timeless, but of the book itself.In all honesty, I am a bit puzzled about the edition I purchased. It does have the gilt edge and leather cover. The ISBN in the book matches the one provided for this item. It does not contain any annotations nor the colour images mentioned in other reviews. It is a pocket-sized book, but the term ""Deluxe Pocket Edition"" appears nowhere in the book. So, I am puzzled to say the least.The quality of the book is okay, no problems there. Unfortunately, it is rife with editing issues. Additional words and a lack of spaces between some words. It is just a poor editing job.If anyone has any ideas about the above, it would be appreciated in a comment. This particular book I have has 300 pages (not 320) and, as mentioned, lacks colour images and annotations. It was published in 2012."
5,Love it again and again!!,I never tire of this book. It just makes me smile. I like all the back story and the discovery of the ring.
3,"Yea, it eats batteries, but...","like all battery using toys learning to turn them off can save you some dough. I highly suggest, to all parents, really every family- to invest in rechargable batteries and a couple chargers. They may cost a bit more at first, but they are cheaper and really come in handy in the long run- but you have to remeber to use them.Regardless, this toy keeps my little sister entertained - simply because it's a mirror. It could do nothing else but sit there and she'd be delighted. The soft design lights etc is a nice bonus."
3,Okay but could be better,"The mirror is cute and works well. My only recommendations would be to have a timer included in the settings because there are many times that we accidentally left it on after leaving the car which really drains the batteries fast. Also, the song variety could be a bit better. After only a few rounds I was going crazy with the repetive songs. The lights are not very visible during the daytime, but that's okay, I guess."
3,Ok product...,"I think the idea of the lights and music is better than the actual product itself. The lights aren't bright enough to see during the day, so I mainly just use it as a mirror (an over-priced mirror, at that!). I have only used the lights and music probably about 10 times in about a 5 month period. My 6 month old has never really been very interested in it. Also, the biggest complaint I have is for cleaning the product. We had a small smudge on it one day and my husband used a very soft eyeglass cleaning cloth and it made the mirror blury. I have yet to figure out how to properly clean it. The directions say to use a soft cloth, they don't get much softer than eyeglass cloths. The mirror was then ruined, you couldn't see anything in it. We exchanged it, since I didn't have the receipt, for another one of the same and will hopefully not need to clean it! If so, I will definitely not replace it with the same over priced mirror."
3,dissapointed that I can't use,"I bought this toy when I was still pregnant, I thought it was so cute! However, It doesn't work in any of our vehicles. (A 1995 Aerostar and a 2003 Durango). I have my daughters car seat in the middle of the back seat which is the safest. I could use it if I attached it to one of the side headrests, but then she wouldn't be able to see it. I won't jeopardise her safety for a toy. My sister tried it in her van,( a safari) and she said it fit perfectly, so I gave it to her to use for when she has my daughter."
3,2nd time I've gotten a defective mirror...,"This is the 2nd time I've received a defective mirror. I had originally purchashed the older Rainforest mirror that is supposed to play music and has 3 animals dangling from it, however, when I received it, the battery compartment was completely rusted out. My son loves it anyway, he likes looking at the animals. Now, I bought this mirror for my other car, and it won't work! I'm so disappointed."
4,Great for the non-sleeper in the car,"The big mirror gives you a nice view of baby. The lights are fun to look at for a really young baby that gets bored in the car and doesn't like to sleep in the car seat. The music is okay. It doesn't fit great on our head rests (Hyundai Entourage) and easily gets dislodged. If your baby screams uncontrollably in the car (like ours did for a coulple of months) this probably won't make any difference because they'll never notice it. However, if they're just a bit fussy or bored this is nice."
2,Beware...,"I bought one of these from Amazon... the lights and music didn't work. Sent it back, and drove to babiesrus to pick up another one. Same thing: lights and music didn't work.I thought I must be doing something wrong, but I had my husband try it, different batteries, etc. No go. Babiesrus said it must have been a ""bad production batch"".We kept it since my son likes the mirror, but I wouldn't have spent so much money for a plain mirror!I'd choose another til they work out the quirks."
2,Bad,I dont know if we got a bad one or the batteries are dead or what but first of all you cant see the lights and the music is so low whats the point and the remote barley works and the only thing good is i can see little Gavin. Hes having problems in the car and i thought it would help but nope it doesnt
3,1st time mom,This is good for a mirror but unless you want to spend your life savings on batteries then I wouldn't use the lights and music. You have to change the batteries constantly. In my opinion it would be worth while to save some money and get a cheap mirror that doesn't do anything.
2,"good mirror, but has some faults","I got this in my shower. I loved using it and it was big and colorful. But like another reviewer, it has faults. The remote doesn't work all the time and it does shift in the car. I have an SUV, so maybe my headrests are different. But I love this one better than just the standard boring ones."
3,Great when the batteries dont run out,The mirror is great when the batteries dont run out. My son is 7 months and I have had to replace the batteries 4 times. Love the remote and the fact I can turn it on and off whenever I need to from the front seat.
2,Not very durable or safe,I bought the mirror when my son was 3 weeks old and he now 3 months old so needless to say it has only lasted 2 1/2 months before the strap that holds it in place snapped. I always had to adjust the mirror because it never seeemd to stay in place so I would only end up seeing the top of his head.I went to adjust it one day and the strap just snapped like paper. If it would have snapped while I was driving with my son it could have fallen right on him and the mirror is pretty big and could have injured him.Also when the strap snapped fuzzy stuff from the strap went everywhere like little particles. I don't feel that is very safe either because that can be breathed in by him which could be dangerous not knowing what exactly the material is made of.The remote doesn't work very well either.I am normally happy with Fisher Price products but this one was made very poorly.
1,Mirror scratches easily,"I bought this when I was pregnant with my first child. I liked the idea of being able to see him while driving. Unfortunately it didn't work out that way. Before he was born I wiped off the mirror with a soft dry cloth and it scratched so badly I couldn't see anything. I decided to use it anyway for the lights and sounds but, like others, I couldn't get the remote to work. My son is 9 months old now and it's still sitting in my trunk, what a waste of money."
1,DELUXE AUTO MIRROR,THIS MIRROR DIDNT STAY IN PLACE AND COULD OF FALLEN AND HURT THE INFANT MY SON TOLD IT BACK DIDNT LIKE IT.
2,Mirror Scratches,I like the look of the mirror and my daughter loves the lights and music but the mirror scratched the first day we had it. I dont even know if my daughter can see herself in it.
2,Not very pleased,"The mirror has been great to see my baby but everything else stinks. The remote doesn't fit anywhere, it won't shut off by itself so the batteries keep wearing out, and the music won't play. I've only had it 2 months and haven't had it working more then 1-2 times. I'm going to return it to the store."
3,Fastening strap broke!,"I like being able to see my daughter with this mirror and thought she would like it too. But, she doesn't seem to notice that it is there, even when it is playing music and flashing lights. Either way, I had fastened it to the back of the car window fastener loop using the attached plastic strap fastener and when I tried to unhook it to remove the mirror temporarily, it broke! It took quite a bit of problem solving to figure out how to put it back in the car securely and safely. I went to Fischer Price's website and sent a complaint to customer service but NEVER received a response back. I'll think twice about buying any of their products next time!"
2,Mirror Scratches Easily!,"I liked this mirror very much in the beginning, until I made the mistake of trying to wash it with Windex and a papertowel - It's now so scratched that I can't see my son at all!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Don't waste your money - the first one of these we bought stopped working after 2 weeks, the second lasted 3 months and then stopped working. When my husband went to change the batteries he touched the mirror. He then tried to wipe the finger prints off with a soft cloth as advised in the instructions and the mirror is now blurry and ruined. Either keep the plastic film on or don't ever touch the mirror. It's a shame as our daughter liked looking at herself in the mirror. In some ways I'm glad it's broken as I couldn't stand to hear one more round of the tinny sounding tunes!"
2,Don't Waste Money On This One,"We've only had the mirror for 3 weeks. I love the large mirror size, but as others said in their reviews, it isn't worth the money. The mirror itself is very easily scratched and ruined. I cleaned it with a very soft cotton cloth and it is so hazy I can hardly see the baby. The batteries run out because it doesn't stay turned off, it keeps coming back on by itself. The music has now stopped working and the lights are not bright enough during the day to do any good.We are returning it to the store and getting another brand. I should have read the reviews here first."
1,Mirror ruined before I could use it.....,"I took the product out of the box, put in the batteries, and loved how it worked with the remote. I took the film off of the mirror and it was smudged. I went to clean it, and the mirror was ruined first thing. It was scratched by anything I tried to clean it with. It said soft cloth, but anything you use just basically scratches it up or makes it very blurry.I was given this as a gift, so I really don't know where it came from and since I am the one that ruined it, I'm not sure if I can take it back.Like I said, I loved the remote, the lights, the music....but the mirror itself is VERY cheap and can be ruined very easily. it's not worth it, because you are going to have to clean it eventually."
3,a mixed blessing,"My son (2 months old) loves this toy. He seems to be facinated by almost anything that has flashing lights and makes music. I'm not so fond of it. I like the mirror and being able to see my son. But it doesn't install well. If we hit a big bump in the car, it can knock the mirror out of adjustment. The remote won't stay on the visor and it had to be in just the right position to work. I can live with those. But if I have to hear a rather metalic sounding version of THE WHEELS ON THE BUS followed by MY GRANDFATHERS CLOCK much longer, I may scream! The musical selections are less than wonderful, and the arrangements are awful! It keeps my son happy, so I can't complain. But I generally leave the toy on lights only mode and supplement with my own music on CD."
2,Works intermittently....,Baby is not here yet but we tested this out in the car and only works intermittently which is a bummer! So we are experiencing what some others have experienced....for $20 it should work more consistently. We are going to return and look for something different.Would be really great if you could count on this b/c it is cute with the lights and sounds! :-(
3,Good for watching your baby,I like this because I can see if my 2-month-old daughter is awake or asleep. She seems to like the music. My only complaint is that you have to position the remote just right to turn it on. Overall I think it's a good buy.
4,"Good, but different characters than what's pictured","I thought I was getting what was on the screen but got the rainforest animals instead, which was fine because it is cute, better than what is on view now. My daughter likes seeing herself in the mirror and likes to see the animals light up (when it's dark outside)."
5,Good purchase for neurotic new mommies (such as myself),"Being a first time Mommy, I was having minor heart palpatations every time my little daughter made a squeak in the back seat and I could not see her. I won't confess how many times I actually pulled over on the side of the road to check everything out....oh dear!I bought this, my husband had to prop it up a bit with a little burp cloth tucked underneath to position it correctly, but other than that it works great. I love it, I can see her very clearly (the mirror is bigger than most) and the music is not too annoying.Great purchase!"
1,big mistake,"Bought this for all the same reasons as the others..colors, sounds, big mirror. BIG mistake. I also have an SUV, it does not stay in place. Have to use towels etc. to even come close to a good view. The remote...what a joke. Ya it works if I'm sitting in the back seat and can be right next to the sensor. It does not work. The lights are only really visible at night, the music is not even something that would be nice for a baby. And for the price too expensive for such a disappointment. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,A blessing...and a curse!,"I got this mirror as a gift...and loved it for four months! Yes, the music was annoying to anyone over the age of 2; yes, you could only see the lights at night; and yes, the remote was a pain. HOWEVER, the mirror was perfectly positioned and huge. I could see my son whenever I wanted and once the batteries died, we didn't replace them (no more music!). But yesterday I as was driving along without my son (a very rare occasion), the nylon strap snapped in half and the whole thing came crashing down into the car seat. I called Fisher Price only to be (rudely) told that it wasn't their problem. They directed me to Safe Fit's website. There was a phone number on the site but it was a long distance number. Instead of getting a human, I got voicemail. I e-mailed the company but have not yet heard back. Apparently, Fisher Price does not make alot of the baby stuff with thier name on it. I will think twice before buying a Fisher Price product!"
2,defective?,"the first time i put this in my car i thought i was just being dumb about installing it. after the 4th time trying to install it, i finally got it to stay in the position i wanted. yet the second i had to stop, it flew back wards and never bounced back. the ""lullaby's"" that come out are horrible little sounds. when i was in the store looking at it, i thought it would be a awesome mirror due to the size of it and it lights up and plays music, but boy, was i wrong."
3,Nice to see baby while driving,"I bought this product so I could see my daughter while I was driving. I liked the added feature of having a remote to turn on the lights and music so I wouldn't have to stop if she started fussing. My only problem is that the remote works to turn it on but the remote will not turn it off. It may be a defective remote but I figured as long as it works to turn it on, I can turn it off once I get to where I am going. I just would like to be able to turn it off once she falls asleep so the batteries last longer and there is no sense of letting it play if she is not listening to it."
2,"Great Mirror, but the remote is useless!!","The positive....it is wonderful to be able to see my baby in his rear-facing car seat. The negative....the remote never worked, which is why I chose this mirror in the first place. I thought it would be entertaining to my son and a real convenience while driving. Thinking there may be a defect with that particular mirror, I returned it for a new one. My husband and I encountered the same problem. We decided to keep it anyway because the mirror is large and provides a great view of my baby. However, if you are purchasing this mirror because of the neat remote idea, you may want to think again!"
2,Don't bother...,"I bought this thinking the lights and music would help keep my little one entertained when he got fussy. Well, if the lights would work, maybe it would be worth the money! The lights did not work one first one we bought. The second one we got as a replacement actually worked well for about a month before a couple of lights went out.Don't bother calling Fisher Price to let them know about any problems, they will just give you a number to the company that licensed the Fisher Price name for this product. The company is called Blue Ridge, but don't bother calling. They will not call you back.I gave this product 2 stars because it did keep my son slightly interested. Don't spend the extra money for the lights and music, just get a basic mirror and you will be better off."
1,Disappointed by cheap mirror,This item did not last a day. My husband got a few fingerprints on the mirror while installing it. I tried to clean following the directions and the surface of the mirror was ruined.
3,Stock up on batteries,"I thought this was great. It was big enough to see my son. It played music and lit up. It was even easy to install. However, it ate batteries like they were going out of style."
2,Not great,"This mirror is big and does play good music and the lights are nice, BUT you can't install this thing if you wanted to!!! It is awful to try to keep it in place. I don't know what the manufacturers were thinking when they designed this but they messed up. It shifts around every time you make a turn and falls down when you stop and start. It is a good idea, but just needs more work. Maybe a headrest in the middle seat would solve the problem but my SUV doesn't have that so this mirror is pretty much worthless."
5,Keeps baby entertained,"This mirror works so well! From the time I brought my son home from the hospital he hated riding in the car. He would scream the whole time. When I put this mirror in the back seat, it entertained him immediately. It is remote control activated so I can shut it on and off when I need to. The mirror is big as well so I can watch every move that he makes. The characters on the sides light up. This is a must have. I dont' have one complaint about this"
2,Not worth it,"I didn't get much use out of this b/c when it was time to switch over to our particular convertible car seat, there was no way to safely anchor the mirror as well (b/c a tether came over the top and side of the car seat to the anchor in back.)So I was going to sell the mirror, but then I touched the mirror with my hand (I guess I had lotion on??) and there was a huge black smear. So I tried to get the smear off with window cleaner, and that made the whole mirror worse, so now it's all foggy!Also, the remote didn't come even close to fitting on my visor."
5,A great shower gift,"My son is 10 weeks old and loves this toy. Whenever he is crying we turn it on with our little remote on our visor and he is immedialely quiet. it's also nice when it is dark because you can see him in the mirror when the lights are on. I wasn't thrilled at first with this gift, but we never go for any car rides without this. The mirror is also great because you can watch the baby and it doesn't block your view. A great shower gift that any mom would love."
2,Choose something else - this is not a good design!,"I bought this toy for our baby and have discovered some major design flaws - the biggest being unable to turn this toy on (at all) without the remote!!! So, having misplaced the remote for a time - i can't even turn it on. Had I wanted just a mirror I could have found something much less expensive. Another flaw is that you have to remember to slide the power switch over when you put the baby in the car or even the remote doesn't work (if you haven't lost it). And finally, it does not position well for baby to see into."
1,Do Not Buy This Worthless Thing!,"Like many other parents who bought this, I see, I feel this is an absolute WASTE of money (and time). I bought one when my daughter was 3 months and rear-facing so that I could see her when I was driving. I brought the 1st one back b/c the remote stopped working after the 1st week. I changed the batteries 3 times but it still didn't work. I exchanged it for the exact same thing - thinking it was just a fluke - and WHAMMO, same thing! My daughter is now almost 1-year old and I've basically only ever used the mirror part which isn't even that great. What a waste of $$$. When it did work, the music/remote was fine. But in both cases, it was very short-lived. Save your money and buy a much better mirror without all the bells and whistles...at the very least, don't buy this brand."
2,Lesson learned,"My child had really enjoyed having a toy attached to his infant car seat so when he advanced to the larger car seat I wanted something to entertain him. I thought it was probably pretty mind numbing to sit and look at the back of a seat! I thought he would enjoy this because of the music, lights, bright colors etc but he could really care less. Not to mention I can't get the thing to stay attached. Despite numerous attempts I could not get it to stay in my small car so I moved it to my husband's larger SUV. Although better, it still falls down frequently and there is no way the remote will clip on the sun visor. It really wouldn't matter if it did, it won't work unless it is directly pointed at the mirror. I think I'll keep searching for something to entertain him while traveling."
2,Defective??,"I love Fisher Price items, but no matter how many times I've changed the batteries, I can't get this thing to work. Even when I had the remote inches away from it.I do however love the way it did light up that one time and how easily I could see Niko in the back. The mirror is on the larger side which is great. But if it doesn't light up, what good is it?It's going back.Edited 8/5: Took it back to BRU, got a new one and it works fine."
2,ONLY works w/Remote!!!,"We bought this for our son about 3 monthes ago & he really likes it. He likes to follow the lights & listen to the music. I like that the mirror is big enougth for me to see him in. I also really like that it has a volume control dial for the music & not just a high & low setting.However, this mirror will only turn on by using the remote. Something I didn't know when I purchased it. Otherwise I wouldn't have bought it. There is no on switch for the music or lights on the mirror itself.Also, I have found that the remote will not work if it gets cold. So, I can't leave the remote in the car, I have to either bring it into the house or put into the diaper bag. Sometimes the remote is left behind & I have no way to turn the mirror on. I am then left with an overpriced mirror. That is the biggest flaw that I have found in this mirror & to me it is a big oversight."
1,Not worth the hassel!,"SO we were taking a very long, very boring car trip and I thought that having a mirror with lights and sounds would work wonders for our 4 month old. It would have been helpful if it had WORKED. We stop four times at different Walmarts along the way (where I purchased the first) and NONE of them worked. I talked to one lady who said that she had already had 3 returned that morning. Save yourself the hassle and buy a different mirror!"
1,Terrible! I should have listened to the reviews,"I put the batteries in and nothing works! No lights, no music, I could have just purchased a $1.99 drugstore mirror and mounted it on the headrest. I'm especially irked because I live in the Middle East and paid all this money to have it shipped here and it doesn't even work. What a waste of money.Please note that this actually isn't manufactured by Fisher Price; the name is licensed. I actually called Fisher Price to tell them that this company, Blue Ridge, is giving Fisher Price a bad name! I read the reviews on this and knew what I was getting myself into, but thought oh, since I generally have good luck with products, it'll be OK. Actually, it's not OK! I emailed Blue Ridge to tell them about this issue. It seems as though the receiver on the mirror is defective. We'll see what they have to say."
1,Had to return twice!,"I am 9 months pregnant and saw this mirror at toys r us and fell in love with it. When i went home to put batteries in it the mirror would not activate so i figured i had to use the remote to activate it. But when i tried to put batteries in the remote the top screw would not unscrew. It turned in a circle 100 times and did nothing. I thought perhaps i got a defective one so i exchanged it at toys r us and to my dissatisfaction, when i returned home with what i thought was a new mirror, i opened the box and the remotes screws were completely stripped. Someone must have has the same ""defective"" problem as i, and toys r us just put it right back on the shelf! I'm dissapointed because i generally trust fisher prices products, and now will think twice before buying anything without opening the box first."
2,No Knobs?,I guess it was in very small print because i didnt realize tht there were NO Knobs in the box and i hadto spend amother 75 over and above what i had alreasy spent! The piece is gorgeous and very functional but to not include knobs is rediculous
5,Very Nice,I got my first one of these lights in a kit along with a new drill and I liked it so much that I bought two more. The light works with both the 12 and the 14.4 volt batteries and will last a long time on a charge. The light it puts out covers a wide area very evenly which makes it a very nice worklight. I would recommend this product.
1,The pictures are incorrect,"The cable is 6pin to 6pin, the pictures are 6pin to 4pin.The cable is very good, it just happens to be the wrong pictures."
4,A softrocking song,"The Forever Failure-single, including the titletrack, is a real good emotional-rocking thing! The other tracks is: Another Desire , a slow one, but a good one! Fear , the third track, is a real fast one, maybe the fastest in Paradise Losts history!!!"
5,liked it a lot,I really liked the book and am teaching a class of it right now. It has great info for everyone
3,The Texture small bible,"I like it very much especialy for the story of each texture, but I prefer a larger version of this book with more textures!"
4,"bad disks (Chapter 15),..skips 40 seconds","My copy freezes at 07 seconds into Chapter 15 then jumps to 46 seconds later. If one watches the timer, one will see it did more then freeze. After it freezes you can back up to 8 seconds into Chapter 15 and continue. A few small things do happen in the during the jump. We checked out 4 copies and all were bad. My copy is NOT the Limited edition version but has the same flaw. I don't know if the other reviewer posted under the wrong version or both versions has the same flaw.As for the movie , I am a big fan of Ghost in a Shell and love them all. And as for one reviewer's questions, it is dubbed into English by them same crew."
5,awesome,"i downloaded a torrent of the jap version of this and im still buying the english dvd. the premisie is prettty simple a computer master mind is getting bots to kill them selves. over all an exelent movie, while not as visually stunning as innocence it raises the bar in terms of storytelling. if u pick this up you will not be dissapointed."
5,Such a good movie,"I don't exactly have a lot of time to write a review at the moment, so I'll summarize it with this: If you're a fan of Ghost in the Shell, or even just cyberpunk, Solid State Society is very relevant to your interests.The only bad thing I could say is it wasn't a 26 episode season like Stand Alone Complex or 2nd Gig. In the end it made me realize just how badly I want more Ghost in the Shell!"
3,Be prepared to have a DVD that may not work.,"The first disc that I ordered went to the title screen, but couldn't play the movie. The second disc played, but had temporary trouble with Ch 15. When I watched it through on the second one, the story was great and I would love to buy this. I have contacted the companies that make this movie about the issue. I will buy at a later date when they fix the problem."
4,Ghost In the Shell Solid State Society Is Good and Worth Buying,"I liked solid state society, and I think that if you like the stand alone complex series, you will like solid state society as well. It is more like the 2nd gig than the original stand alone complex series. The quality is great. It is rather convoluded though, as ghost in the shell can be at times, but I would say its no more complex than 2nd gig was, and for the most part, it is an interesting cyberpunk action movie. I strongly recommend getting the soundtrack. It comes with the steel book edition (only $1 more on amazon when I bought it). Yoko Kanno's music is absolutely fantastic. This soundtrack is much more in the classical genre, but there are also some good techno/pop tracks."
5,Outstanding addition to any dvd collection,"For those unfamiliar with the premise of the ""ghost in the shell"" franchise, it is based in the future focusing on the trials and tribulations of an elite crime-fighting group known as Section 9.Solid State Society is a direct to dvd movie based on the ""stand alone complex"" TV series which, itself, was a spin-off from the original 1995 film.I won't go into the plot details but i will tell you as far as anime films go this is one of the best around. With an intellectual story that incorporates numerous themes and action that, for it's modest budget, is quite impressive.Finally, the DVD includes both Japanese & English audio in DTS 5.1. So if you are an anime collector, I'm probably telling you everything you already know. If you are yet to be introduced to the wonderful world of anime, this maybe the movie that gets the ball rolling...."
5,Ghost In The Shell: Solid State,"Loved it, loved it, loved it. If you're a GOS fan, while it's different from the series, it's still fun to watch. It's an alternative story line to the series and the other movies but it's still GOS no matter how you look at it. Motoko is just as fiesty as ever, the Tachis - well, they're different but they still have that sense of fun about them, especially in Tachikomatic Daze that is available on the dvd.If you're new to GOS - watch it and watch all the other GOS series. I think you'll enjoy it... especially the Tachikomas."
4,"bad disks (Chapter 15),..skips 40 seconds","My copy freezes at 07 seconds into Chapter 15 then jumps to 46 seconds later. If one watches the timer, one will see it did more then freeze. After it freezes you can back up to 8 seconds into Chapter 15 and continue. A few small things do happen in the during the jump. We checked out 4 copies and all were bad.As for the movie , I am a big fan of Ghost in a Shell and love them all. And as for one reviewer, it is dubbed into English by them same crew."
2,would be 5 stars but...,"I am a huge fan of the GITS series, but when I purchased this DVD I encountered a gread deal of digital interference, leading eventually to an unplayable disk approx. 10 minutes into the film. No system is perfect, I figure, so I chalk it up to a defective copy and order a replacement. What do I find? Same problem, just 30 minutes into the film instead of 10. From what I saw, the story is great and the animation is excellent; overall, an excellent addition to the series. Thus, it would get 5 stars, but two DVDs (both purchased new) that are unplayable drops it down (even only seeing 30 minutes of it, it doesn't deserve a 1 star rating, to hell if I didn't get to see the entire movie)."
3,Did I get a bad copy? 5 for the movie 2 for the DVD,I don't know if any of you have a similar issue but at the start of chapter 15 there is a 2 second layer pause on mine. My player has memory buffers to greatly reduce the time for a transition and I don't have this long of one on any other DVDs I own. Any way the movie itself is terrific with a great job by the dub team at Bandai. Thats why I give the movie itself a 5 and the DVD a 2 cause of the annoying pause in chapter 15. For a an average 3 stars.
4,good movie,"I'd have to agree with others who have described this movie as more of an extended television episode. It's not got the same impact as the previous movies, but it's still quite good. Good story, familiar characters, I enjoyed it!"
2,not meant for cd,"with traditional music you cannot judge but only comment. however this cd seems to be a form of music that could only be appreciated live. the first track is a woman beating a drum and chanting sporadically. the second track is a man beating a drum and chanting sporadically. the third is a little more dynamic but still does not convey itself in a cd format. its interesting, especially perhaps if you study Mongolian or Mongolian ritual. However, as a sample of the world's traditional music you'd be better off looking for a video."
2,Broken in FIVE minutes,"I bought the Istyle and was extremely excited to receive it. When it got here, it was attractive, and came in a fairly speedy fashion.So I put the Ipod in the case (hooray!) and it looked great and works well. Then, after snapping and unsnapping the cover approximately three times, the snap broke, and now the cover is useless. This is an incredibly shoddily-made piece of equipment. To top it off, Speck won't refund your shipping, should you want to send back their defective product.Save yourself the trouble and spend your money on something that will hold together for longer than 5 minutes (the length of time for which I was able to enjoy the Speck Istyle cover)."
3,so so,"I've just got this case. It's not that bad as the review upstairs, but it's definitely not good. It works, but the stuff is not well produced. If you don't care about the craft, this case is probably what you want. By the way, I'm satisfied with the screen protector of this case, seems like it will protect the screen as new, but I will not scratch it."
5,This Sums It Up,"I have enjoyed this poem for many years and have a framed calligraphy of it on my wall. The book is wonderfully designed and the drawings fit so well with the words. I would recommend it to anyone for themself or as a gift. It is heartwarming, uplifting and definitely words to live by!"
4,very good very funny in the hangover type way,this was a somewhat low budget movie but you really cant tell and its surprisingly very funny NOT in the spoof way in an all new real life way like the first hangover movie does. you really out to watch this movie
4,Good Zombie Flick,"Has a plot that makes you think. Zombies don't look fake an all around good zombie movie. A good late night popcorn movie! A wonderful tale of the undead. I love watching the living dead infest and roaming the countrysides. It's an all out fight for survival. I liked it! But then I loved, Children Shouldn't play with Dead Things"
4,"Funny, cool, and original","This is a wonderful and funny movie. I really enjoyed watching it and the efx are pretty good too. In a saturated ""zombie"" genre it is a standout and if you like zombie movies you should watch it."
5,Fiber Bow for 150lb Crossbow,"have had this on my bow sence april 2010, still working like new.I would recomend this as a good long lasting replacement for any 150 lb bow."
5,"Oh, Joy!","This is a fun little c.d., apparently a one-off project fronted by the intensely cute and talented Miss April March. It brings back all the fun of what punk rock used to be, including the tunefulness, energy (like most great punk records, the band seems to be playing about as fast as they can without the whole thing falling apart), and even the cartoonish obnoxiousness-- they cover Angry Samoans, Fear, and the Hard-ons. Great originals by the band are included as well. Fun for girls and boys!"
4,High nutrition Bird food,"While this products is recommended by Vets and local avian club members; if the birds don't eat it, then what. I find most of it left in the seed cups after every thing else is picked over. Hopefully they are eating some of it. They seem to prefer scrambled eggs and field greens over the pellets."
5,Stop Motion Anarchy,"If there's nothing that can satisfy your hunger for a sketch comedy show that is actually funny, smart, and never gets old. Robot Chicken is that show and this box set includes over 20 episodes, Unrated, a load of special features. The third season shines with more hilarious sketches and fine-tuned writing that promotes hilarity. If you own previous seasons this is a must-have, don't think about it just buy it. Nothing is sacred in this blockbuster cult smash-hit of a sketch comedy show. Seth green and company have dedicate a level of intensity to make the comedy funny and memorable for years to come."
2,Not as good as expected...,"Season 1 was good, the second was really cool, and these one really disappointed me... Definitely a let down."
3,75% gross sex jokes 25% humorous,"The first and second seasons were genious! All of it. But season 3 is somewhat disappointing. I've tried to forget some of the images that have entered my head, but cant.However some if it re-captures it's old charm."
3,Is this a typo?,Is this a typo? Is there really such a thing as a quartz watch which costs $725.00 on sale? Wow.
3,needs dosbox.exe to play,This program is an old dos program you can download dosbox from dosbox.com its fun to play but Shrapnel Game's (Camo Workshop) WinspwwII is almost the same thing and it has more battles and customizeable game features
2,"Some good, lotsa bad","I found this book to contain some very interesting information about Grenadian people and their customs, but the text is interspersed throughout with ""poor me"" stories which leave this reader wondering why these comfort-seeking Floridians just picked up and moved to the wilds of Grenada in the first place. Many aspects of the Grenadian culture are not only not appreciated, but are considered primitive or ignorant. The Howards are upset that the locals step on mice which fall from their harvested banana bunches rather than treating them as pets. We are told of attacks by human vampires which are as believable to the author as the claim that men have landed on the moon. I suggest reading this book with a great deal of skepticism."
4,Evocative Story of an Attempt to Flee to the Tropics,"Grenada is a little-known Caribbean island I have visited several times. This family lived there for four years, and the trials of adapting to a wet, humid, red tape-ensnarled tropical country were great. They might have made it, difficulties and all, except for the advent of the Grenadian Communist Revolution. Too bad they didn't start their adventure in the 1980s; the pleasant, inquisitive, but essentially very decent Grenadian culture has reasserted itself. An interesting, accurate depiction flawed only by a lack of background context and clear personal profiles of the couple and their children. The book is a vivid page-turner, and a valuable addition to the Caribbean literature."
2,No Kidding,"This book was pretty entertaining at times. However, it was easy to see why this family had so many difficulties on the island - many of their choices were pretty questionable. They move onto a mountain in a foreign country (a mountain to which they refer as ""our mountain""), burn the natural vegetation to clear it for building, let their young child swing from trees barefoot WHILE the fire is burning, and then marvel that their child burned her feet when she jumped down and landed in the fire. Huh? Are you kidding? Multiply this by like 500 and you have a whole bookful of Memories to Die For. Go figure."
3,Was ok...,"I bought this based on all the great reviews. I have two boys, 7 and 3 1/2. My 7 year old is always interested in all things Chinese so I thought I could show him what China looked like and see a bit of the culture. He liked it but he kept asking me questions about it. I think they could have been a little more forthcoming about what we were looking at. It was mostly Big Bird just showing us the sights but not saying anything other than what it was called and sometimes not even that. My 3 year old wasn't too engaged at all. He watched but kept asking me ""Is it done yet?"" towards the second half. The premise is cute but I thought it could have been a little more entertaining and educational. The majority of the film was us watching Big Bird walking around not saying anything. They could have used that time to tell us a little about what we were looking at. I'm not saying they have to give us a whole history lesson but a little something interesting for each sight would have been nice."
3,Correct price: $19.99 not $50.00,"At Target or Walgreens and other stores, the actual selling price is 19.99 and I have seen it for 16.99 ..To say the actual price is $50.00 is outrageous .."
5,DayDream,The Greatest Jazz singer in the world has done it again. Age is no boundary for this legendary songtress.
3,Not a compilation of Nancy Wilson's Best,"First of all, I should say I am a Nancy Wilson fan since my teens. This is merely a compilation of her Sony Music output. And this output consists of pure commercial soulful forgettable songs with one or two exceptions. Sorry! And I tell you her best is on Capitol Records. There are some great albums here @Amazon."
3,Cats and kittens,We get this calendar evry year. The cats are a joy but some are kittens only in spirit.
2,"OK, but not great","These one-piece lid lifters are prone to dumping ash in the food. They're better than nothing, but don't grip the lid tighly.They don't grip the lid firmly like the good lifters (with the three legs and the hook operated by gripping the handle). The good lid lifters retail for only 2-3 dollars more, and will put a huge smile on your face the first time you discover you don't have to do any kind of balancing act to manipulate the lid."
4,Nice film,I purchased this film because I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan and he has a special appearance in this film. He appeared in the second half of the film for quite a few minutes and it was very enjoyable to see him. Rani Mukerji stars in this film and I really enjoy seeing her in films. I believe the name of the male lead is Vivek Oberoi. He did a good job in his role. This film tells the love story of two young adults who marry dispite opposition from family. It depicts the reality of life for newlyweds. It also shows how true love rises above trivial matters in the face of a major crisis.
5,Nice,I bought two of John's CD at the same time and do love the sound of his music.His music is soft and relaxingThe only problem I can state is all the music sounds the same. Wish I had only bought one CD
3,I thought it was OK,"I've seen better but I've seen worse.The information on the physical aspects of sleep and dreaming, sleep stages, brain waves, and psychological theories and theorists is all insightful but something that you can skip completely if you have even an introductory level knowledge of Psychology.The directory of dream images was somewhat refreshing to me in that, unlike the typical ""dream dictionary"", it allows for the fact that different symbols will mean different things to different people depending on their experiences/world views.I will warn that, if you have a degree in English and/or are a stickler for details, you should not read this book. It will drive you up a tree with numerous glaringly obvious typos, omissions, and spelling errors."
1,Horrible--save your money,"Bought this book on the strength of the other reviews, but this book is horrible--other books in the same category have many more images and explanations included."
4,I learned a lot but still prefer...,Dreams: Gateway to the True Self. It just had more depth and insight to the questions we really want answered.
4,A Student's Review,"This book was very helpful to me on my report on dreams. I learned a lot of facts, such as Freud's theory of dreams. This book is very good if you want to learn more about the interesting topic of dreams. It was also amazing how much I learned! I was enjoying myself while learning."
5,solar,"`Shleep' has been compared to `Rock Bottom', Robert Wyatt's early masterpiece made after he was paralysed. It's his best since `Rock Bottom', but the comparison goes further than that. `Rock Bottom' seemed to yearn for bodilessness and mobility thro' submergence in moonlit water. But `Shleep''s gorgeous, moving central track, `Alien', longs for the opposite: ascent into the ether, effortlessly supported by air in sunblind instinctual motion. Elsewhere, the delicious `Maryan' is just skybound because of its gorgeous melody; and back on Earth, `Free Will and Testament' again finds Robert wondering what it would it be like `to be not me'. Very varied and - despite insomnia - extremely poised, `Shleep' is a beautiful record. I think it's the best in the progressive rock genre for the last 20 years."
5,Astonishing,"How anyone can have been around as long as Robert Wyatt and end up putting out an album this good - easily the best of the best records he has ever made is completely beyond me. There could be no smoother blend of folk, pop, mingus style jazz meandering, and even at times almost a musique concrete feel. My hero!"
3,Disappointing...,"I am writing a major paper on Two Spirits so I bought this because I understood it would be more about Fred Martinez, which is what all the hype makes you believe. The rest of the information about Two Spirits I could find anywhere and had already. Very disappointed..."
4,great ring,I just received this ring and I like it a lot. The ring it looks very expensive and my friends couldn't tell about it. Most people I knew thought I'm married or engaged with fiance.
2,part of a flood long-forgotten...,"One of many releases dumped on the unsuspecting melodic rock community by the now long-defunct Long Island Records label in the mid 90's, when melodic rock and its fans were suffering from a major deprivation. The genre was purposely and consciously neglected and stomped into the ground by record labels and critics alike, to give way to grunge and alternative rock.Long Island tried to target the still existing underground fanbase with a huge number of releases, some new, some re-relaeses of old forgotten jewels (like Bystander). All-in-all it was too much, and Den Of Thieves certainly did not stand out of the lot in any way. Not bad if you're a diehard collector of anything that's melodic, but there are certainly hundreds of better recommendations..."
3,Good Novel of First World War,"I found this book on a list of favorite war novels and wanted to try it. It was good reading, especially the portions about slugging it out with the Huns in the trenches. This is the story of some young British officers in an infantry battalion from the beginning of WW I until the Armistice. The combat scenes are interspersed among accounts of their leaves back in London as they court various young ladies. The party life of the big city is in stark contrast to the horrors of trench warfare and the meatgrinder of machine guns and barbed wire. As the officers, especially Adrian, gain experience they lose their naivety and become hardened soldiers. The descriptions of the fighting are very realistic as the author was actually there when they happened."
1,Not Kitchen Friendly,"I found this booklet to be outrageously priced, incomplete and not user friendly for a publication intended for use in a commercial kitchen. Any standard English-Spanish phrase book would do just as well."
5,Classic Southside,"Every song on this CD is a classic, definitive version, and well worth having if you're just getting started on collecting this great, much overlooked, and entertaining artist. My only beef with it is the cover depicted for this collection makes it appear (1), as if it a live collection, and (2), it shows Bruce Springsteen on his left, and Steve Van Zandt on his right on stage playing, and while Steve did produce, play and sing on a majority of these cuts, Bruce did not, and you can clearly tell by listening to the samples that it's not done ""live"". So don't be expecting otherwise if you're new to this release.Otherwise, this is a fantastic collection from the mid-late seventies, when Southside was first getting started, and turning out some momentous, and classic Beach/Rock, R&B;, and Soul like no other artist at that time. Higly recommended!"
5,This book is captivating for animal lovers of all ages!,I am 33 years old. I bought Rascal for my 6 year old daughter. But I became totally enchanted with this book. The story is funny and poignant. It is made all the more fascinating because it is the true story of the author's childhood in an era most of us know little about. Highly recommended
3,Good Book!,"This book was quite good and there were some really neat things that Sterling did with Rascal. I love animals, any kind rather then spiders (what am I saying, those aren't even animals!), so I thought it was really cool that in this book a racoon and a boy were best friends and could almost communicate. I really would rate this a 3.5 but that wasn't listed. But, I would have rated this book 4 stars if it hadn't ended so sadly! I mean, we have this cute story about a boy and his racoon's friendship and its looking like everything is going to be great, until at the end it gets all sad! Other than that I reccomend that if you are feeling like a little readin' on the ol' couch, just pick up this here book! (Like my accent?) The only thing I'm wondering about is.... is this based on a true story? If you know, anyone, you're welcome to e-mail me at: biljabong@aol.com"
4,Rascal,Rascal is a very good book. It's about a boy named Sterling. He goes out in the woods with his friend Oscar and his dog Wowser. The dog starts digging at a rotting stump and all of a sudden a mother racoon pops out and starts running up a tree. Sterlig finds a baby racoon and takes it home as a pet. And thats how the friendship begins. I recommend that you read Rascal.
5,Rascal,"A good plot, amusing characters, and comfortable reading, made this a good book. Scenes like Rascal helping Sterling win a pie eating contest is one example of the authors entertaining style. I totally recommend this book for anyone's enjoyment of reading. It involves the relationship of action and adventure."
3,Rascal,"Rascal is a very good book,because it was very extciting.I think people woulld realy enjoy reading the book.Some of the charaters are Sterling, and Rascal.It was very good book."
3,Literary Analysis of Rascal-A good book-sometimes boring,"In this adventurous story, Sterling and Rascal make a decision of their life.[The author uses great literary devices and character traits that make the story come alive.] The literary devices he uses makes everything come alive with interest. Using a magic 3, Sterling writes about Rascal,""The raccoon who was clever, fast, and sly"" made Sterling name him Rascal. The author also uses imagery. He writes, ""As Rascal and Sterling walk through the forest, they seee many scary trees..."" His imagery makes the story come alive. Using a simile, he writes, ""Rascal is a fast raccoon like a cheetah running for his prey."" I think every literary device makes the story cool and keeps my interest. Character traits make all the characters to be remembered in some way. About Rascal, the author writes,""Rascal bites only when you hurt him when you treat him bad. Overall, I think the story was OK! I was in my top 10 list of all the books I have ever read."
4,Rascal Book Good - Rascal Movie So-So,"The book Rascal was good, but the 1969-1970 Disney movie that it was made from was so-so, noticeably neutered by not referring to the Great War (World War I) that was going on when the story was taking place.If the producers had desired, anti-war parallels could have been drawn between World War I and the Vietnam War.Talk about lost opportunities!"
2,Rasal,"I did not like this book. I had to read it for school. At first, it seemed interesting, but then it got really really boring. It really wasnt my intrest,and i did not like what was going on in the story. It was confusing, no matter how many times i read it. I really did not think it was written well."
2,A Kids Reaview,I really didn't enjoy this piece. I had to read it for school. I complained alot every night I had to read it. It is really very confusing and I think that the overall book was pretty horible. It was probably on the list of the top ten books that I DIDN'T like. Others may have different feelings but I really didn't like it at all.
1,YAWN!!!!!!!!!,"What a boring book! Seriously, get a plot! I wouldn't recommend this book to people who like realistic, exciting books. This just made me go to sleep. If you're a preteen girl like me, I wouldn't advise to read this book."
2,blech!,"I can't speak for Powerbar's other items, but this one (protein plus, reduced sugar) was uneatable. I had one bite and literally had to go find something else to eat to get the taste of this product out of my mouth. The chocolate coating was waxy, the inside was gummy. It's not a matter me not liking reduced sugar foods; I drink diet soda and routinely eat other foods with artificial sweeteners. I give this item 2 stars strictly for its nutritional value (packs a whallop of protein) but would never buy it again. Buy a single bar at your grocery store to make sure you like it before you buy a whole case. Please."
4,All you need to know?,"This is a neat little book with lots of wisdom Gustafson apparently learned through experience. Some ""how to buy a sailboat"" books seem to be written by naval architects or good writers with limited experience. But this one combines experience with science. I have quite a few years experience sailing all sorts of boats in several locations and have owned several boats, but I still found myself taking notes while I read the book. You will too, I think, enjoy this little masterpiece. When purchasing or researching a sailboat to purchace this book will save you time and help you make an informed decision."
4,"very good, and worth it","I found this book to be an excellent way to spend fourteen dollars. It is a 0.3% investment if you're thinking of a $5000 boat, and worth every penny. It's accessible to the novice, as it includes a glossary of salty terms and details many of the fundamentals of boats, yet it is also useful for the experienced sailor who could use a good review of the topic before making an investment. It is full of information that can save you much frustration should you buy a boat not completely informed. It is well written and organized well. It's photos are in black and white, and they're a little dark, but still effective."
3,A Sanroma item,"The reason you'd buy this is for Sanroma the pianist, an artist of great insight, technical fluency and interpretative acumen.Surely he's the only one to make the slaggardly, empty and corny Grofe concerto worth hearing--once. Grofe himself is a mediocre conductor, and without lending any composer insights, he also makes the Rochester Phil sound nearly amateur, surely never its status, ever.The Gershwin is superb, Sanroma imparting a great pleasure in playing, the authorative Gershwin counductor Steinberg in top form...and the Pittsburghers faring up to their standard, unlike their poor Rochester bretheren.Half a disk can't be considered a good buy, but the whole isn't exactly in the woof-house, either."
2,Still sounds bad after all these years!,"Without a doubt, this is the most unspectacular reading and recording of Ferde Grofe's otherwise-classic light music suite, ""Grand Canyon."" Much of the problem lies with Grofe's indifferent conducting; the rest lies with a drab and poorly balanced recording quite atypical of the label, Everest. Everest produced a number of sonic masterpieces around the same time (1960), so what happened here? The ""Concerto for Piano in D minor"" is interesting only as a stab at traditional composition by Grofe. Otherwise, the listener is at least eight bars ahead of the composer most of the way in this beautifully-written but vapid work. More invovled conducting would have helped, a lot."
4,unique performance,"There are many recordings of the Grand Canyon Suite in better sound than this one, which seems a bit thin. Still, it's nice to hear the composer's take on it. The real value of this piece (leaving aside the Rhapsody, which is not on my LP copy) is what may be the only recording of Grofe's only piano concerto, a slight but charming piece with brassy bluster and corny charm. It's in a hurry from the first bar, and doesn't really take any time out for a slow movement, and it gets some good mileage out of a Prokofiev-like reappearance of themes with more flashy ornamentation. It wears well, too. I've been listening to it for over a quarter of a century and still find it running through my head."
3,Book not in New Condition,"Book was described as new however book cover is torn in multi places. I was disappointed as this was a gift. Should have been labeled ""Like New"""
5,Good value,"This is the first edition of a definitive study of *every* U.S. Gold Coin through 1933 (when circulating god was ended by FDR). This has all the information of the later edition at a fraction of the price. What's missing is a few new auction numbers, and updated market value; for me however, such data will be changing anyway, while the scholarly content stays the same. The photography is superb, and the knowledge base is deep."
3,Art of Magic:good or bad?,"This is a o.k. game, besides the lag on multiplayer and O.k. graphics and [disappointing] voice. It has a good story line. Many of the level are too complicated to figure out how to kill the guy, find the spell, go somewhere else then come back for revenge. Also, levels also give you way too many choices, so it is hard. There are many levels that take a while to beat and require a lot of luck or skill. I conclude this by saying if they make another one they BETTER SPEND MORE TIME ON THE GRAPHICS AND SOUND, THEN IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER."
1,Extravagance Perfume,"The 2 bottles of the perfume I ordered, came wrong, it is not what is shown above. I think it was a mistakeand I am trying to get it back but have not received the postal label.I am sure you will see that I get the right product."
5,Works for me,"I'm the only wine drinker in our home but only have a glass or so a few times a week. Simply recorking a bottle led to good wine gone bad quickly. This product does extend the drinkability. I agree it doesn't taste like the first pour, but it does retain much of the flavor for a few days. It's easy to use, although I thought the diagram that comes with it could use written instruction as well. It would be easier for people like me, who like to follow written directions rather than a map! In any case, good purchase for me."
2,Cascade Plastic Booster,This product was not nearly as powerful as I expected...so my disappointment level was rather significant.
5,Works wonders,"I love this product. It gets stains out of plastic every time and it cleans my dishwasher as well. I used to buy it at Walmart, but now I can't find it anywhere. I have to say Amazon price is a little higher than what I'm used to paying. Still, I will be getting a case of Plastic Booster from Amazon if this is my only choice."
3,wearing garden clogs,"The clogs are ideal, but ordered too large, I can wear them and they are comfy with or without socks. They keep my feet reasonably clean, which was what I wanted."
1,Did not care for them,I go these shoes many years ago and never cared for them. They are still sitting in my shed with hopes of me using them again. I like my crocs better.
4,Does exactly what it needs to.,"I ended up going for this style shaker over the fancier ones that people complain about leaking. I have no real complaints, but the metal is really thin and it seems like the finish could come off or rust at some point."
2,Unglued,"The bottom piece came unglued after the first dishwasher run. Still works fine, but looks ugly and unfinished. What's the fun of having fancy cocktail gear if it doesn't impress your friends?"
1,Cracked in the Dishwasher,"Boston shakers tend to be expensive, so this product was at a reasonable price. After all, it's only a stainless steel cup.Well, it worked fine. I had no complaint when using it to mix drinks. I would often place it in the top rack of the dishwasher to clean it. One day, I found that it was cracked when I pulled it out of the dishwasher. I guess it couldn't handle the temperature. Maybe that's why other shakers are so expensive.This product is useless if you cannot place it in the top rack of the dishwasher."
3,Present for wife,"This was purchased for the ""Cheers "" theme tune, which my wife wanted. Having found out that Gary Portnoy was the singer song writer for said tune, I thought I would trewat her to the album just incase there was anything else on the album she liked. I'm sure she'll be happy so that means I'm happy too."
5,Wow! Spooky!,"Wow, people.Who looked into my life and picked up on all these feelings that I've been having? Who read my mind? Whoever wrote the lyrics on this album seems to know me.The lyrics are amazing. The music is perfect.The songs are great.The singer could be me if only I had a voice.Ah but I do have ears, and I love this album. Bravo."
3,HDCP error,"Item works on standard def videos, but every time an HD video is being streamed across this connection it yields an HDCP error. This part is cast from a completely different mold than the one I ordered."
3,Nice story but too dark!!!,"When I mean 'dark' I mean 'dark'! What made this game frustrating was that some scenes were too dark to find anything! Getting around the lab was really tough cuz you got find these switches to light up the room.(yes, I put my brightness all the way up!)As for the puzzles, some are easy (just keep clicking the symbols if you don't understand the clues) some are hard (just read those books you find) and some are just time consuming (you can get through those mazes eventually!!!).I think the most ""illogical"" part comes after you leave the lab. You have to find the right urn and have the charcoal with you.As for the lip sync, I don't really care about it. It is afterall just a video game with limitations. I don't think the average player is going to notice that.I think this game could have been better if it had more puzzles and less of picking up stuff. Nice story though."
1,Necromonicon,"I do not recommend this game for the following reasons: Too complicated to get through without a cheat guideline. Disappointed with many of the scenes. I would have liked to be able to explore the upstairs of the first home, but was unable to do it. I became bored too soon with this game."
2,starts off good,"Well, I liked this game at the beginning, until you get half way through and then you spend more time ""dying"" then anything else. It got to the point where I no longer wanted to finish the game because of how and why you ""died"". It was just, quite frankly, too annoying to continue to play."
4,A great storyline!,"When I first started playing Necronomicon, I wasn't very impressed by the opening enviornment. However, as the game progressed, I was so intriqued by it. I thought the storyline was brilliant and the some of the locations were downright spooky. I found the puzzles to be difficult but not so much that your about to pull your hair out. I really recommend this game to anybody who likes scary situations, and a challenge. The only downside I could find was that it was a little short and the ending wasn't what I had expected, but I still give it two thumbs up!!"
3,"Not bad, but it's very old","I like this book overall, even though Singer and I differ philosophically. Most of the articles are still good but as you know, in writing academically, this book is pretty old. If you're new to ethics as a philosophy, this is not a bad introduction. Overall, I would say, if you have the money and want a more complete library, buy it. Otherwise, get something newer."
1,Disappointing Camino,"This is probably my least favorite book about the pilgrimage to Santiago. There is very little (in fact, almost no) spiritual insight or even cultural information about the areas experienced. Instead, there is a great deal of complaining about blisters and Germans on the camino. I really cannot recommend this book."
4,Don't get caught in the teachers' lounge,It is a really good book about three kids who are really thristy and the teachers' lounge is the only spot that has pop. They go into the lounge and ... you will have to read the book to find out what happens to them. I would recommend this book to all kids in elementary school.
2,What a baaad sound quality!!,"The playing was great, at least of what I heard it was.... you can't really make out the playing.I've NEVER heard a Cd with such a poor sound quality! THIS IS A SHAME!!!!!"
1,Do not buy this CD!,"This CD is absolutely horrible. It was obviously recorded on something like a boom box and burned to CD - taking advantage of Jaco's name and legacy. Hiram Bullock is listed as the producer, and if that is true, he should be ashamed. Don't waste your money, and don't support these types of recordings either."
4,Quality,"Quality product. Heavy gauge metal, well finished. If not needed as strainer, would also make an attractive fruit bowl in casual kitchen."
5,Breath Taking,"I read this book as part of an application project for Honors 9 Geography. This book talked about the culture and customs of theses people, the way they lived, and what the land around them looked like. I enjoyed the way that the author wrote the book from a fourteen year old girls point of view. This made it easier for me to understand where she was coming from. I thought that it was interesting how the Irish do not care for the English or how the English do not care for the Irish. The authors presentation of the subject makes me feel angry that the Irish and the English could not get along, they should at least try. I feel that this book was written at my reading level. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to read a touching and an emotional story."
2,This book was boring.,"When I got this book I thought it would be exiting, but it wasn`t.It was too BORING!I can't believe that I actually read this book.Maybe other kids would like this book, but I shure wont want to read this book again."
2,WORTHLESS,"THE ONLY ADVANTAGE THIS CAMERA HAS TO OFFER IS IT'S SIZE. TOO MANY DISADVANTAGES TO MENTION. HERE ARE JUST A FEW: 1)LCD BUILT INSIDE THE CAMERA INSTEAD OF THE OUTSIDE. 2)TERRIBLE PICTURES WITH RECOMENDED SETTINGS(VERY BLURRY). 3)NIGHT SHOOTINGS ARE TERRIBLE (FLASH IS USELESS). 4)TO SNAP A PICTURE, YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE BUTTON DOWN FOR ABOUT FIVE SECONDS BEFORE IT CAPTURES THE IMAGE YOU ARE SHOOTING. IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY! DON'T LET IT'S SMALL SIZE CAPTIVATE YOU .... I PERSONALLY WILL NOT RECOMEND THIS CAMERA TO ANYONE."
1,Low EyeQ for seasoned photographers,"For anyone accustomed to the instant response of shutter releases on manual-focus film cameras, the one-second delay between ""press"" and ""click"" on many auto-focus digital cameras is bad enough. Imagine if, after pressing the shutter release, your viewfinder went dark (during which you're instructed to hold the camera very still), three seconds passed before the flash went off, and another five passed before a grainy rendering of your attempted photo appeared in the viewfinder in low-res LCD glory for _another_ five seconds before you finally got a chance to take another picture. Well, this, along with a fast-draining, non-rechargable lithium battery, is exactly what you get with the Concord EyeQ.Yes, it's small, light, inexpensive, and a marvel of engineering. It's the cheapest digital SLR by several hundred dollars. And it drove me crazy in less than fifteen minutes of use. I'm sending it back."
1,Microdisplay Not Reliable,"I was really happy to see that there was finally a small digital camera available that also had an LCD screen. I have had it for a month now and was happy with the image quality, but not with the reliability of the display. I left the camera in my car for only an hour while I was sightseeing on vacation. When I returned and tried to use it again, the display was practically destroyed. It had lines all over it as if it had shattered in the heat. My previous digital camera LCD on the back did not have this problem. Before any one else makes the same mistake, you better not use this camera outdoors or in the heat. Otherwise, you will be disappointed to find out that the display is ruined."
3,"Camera works, software [stinks]","I was pleased with the photo quality and the amount of pictures I could take. Although I would have liked abit longer of a battery life. Camera is perfect for online pics if you don't need to print 8x10's and just want simple pics to email your friends and family.Battery life was not terribly long, went through a battery in 3 days, but that is apparently normal with digital camera's.The biggest problem that I had was with software to transfer the files between the computer and camera. It [stinks]. I had to remove the battery from the camera and replace it every time in order for the software to work, otherwise it would not recoginze the camera. I was using Win2000 Pro. I ended up returning the camera because of this, otherwise the camera is a good price and takes decent pictures. It might work better in a Win 98 environment, the box did not say that Win2000 was a supported OS."
1,...,"The people who wrote positive reviews for this camera [had to be]... employees of Concord.... The viewfinder, the focus mechanism and the flash are all severely flawed. On the positive side...it is small!"
3,Concord EyeQ digitlal camera,"I bought one the othere week ...and because of its small size, find it to be a great little camera to slip onto my belt or into my fanny or back pack pack ( when weight and space are critical) where it is has proved to be hany for those uexpected moments on the trail or about town. It is definitly easy to use. I just wish the pixal resolution was a little better."
3,"Good Price, questionable quality",Good size and price. Pictures are somewhat acceptable in maximum resolution setting. Too bad camera do not remembers customer settings. Battery life is a bit dissapointing 100 shots without flash. Cannot compete with more sofisticated cameras.
1,On second thought.....,"My 1st review was 'a mixed bag', but even after trying to tweak this thing to improve its performance, more that 50% of its images are too blurry to bother saving. In addition, the flash is so hot that unless you place scotch tape over it (2 layers sort of did the trick...kind of an unsightly tweak), your indoor shots will all be useless. In short, forget it, it's a piece of junk."
5,Genius,"Tarkovsky is a genius. Anyone interested in film of any kind should read this book. Utterly inspirational. Truth Spirituality, artistically expressed through film."
3,"Get ""Fugue"" instead","""Sculpting in Time"" is basically a rant by a great film director. That's not to say that his rants don't have their merit. They do. They illuminate his aesthetic approaches to filmmaking and his concept of art (or, as he would say, Art) in society. The trouble is, his comments do not really assist those who simply want to better understand his films. If you're like me and want to gain a greater understanding of and appreciation for Tarkovsky's works, get ""The Films of Andrei Tarkovsky: A Visual Fugue"" by Vida T. Johnson and Graham Petrie."
5,insights from a genius,"This extraordinary book is not just about filmmaking, it's about all art...about life, faith, inner exploration and the Russian soul. It contains exquisite poetry, mostly written by his father, Arseniy Tarkovsky, and detailed descriptions of the making of several of his films as well as photos of them that are eerie, mystical, and incredibly beautiful. Tarkovsky is the master of making us see the wonder of creation in the most mundane subjects. He brings us one step closer in our journey towards the light. From page 43: ""The allotted function of art is not, as is often assumed, to put across ideas, to propagate thoughts, to serve as an example. The aim of art is to prepare a person for death, to plough and harrow his soul, rendering it capable of turning to good""."
4,Deep study of a deep subject,"Regular Expressions are a powerful pattern matching process built into many programming languages (but often hidden and not fully exploited).If you are verifying input from a form or analyzing an HTML page or engaged in any other sort of pattern matching, Regular Expressions are something you should master.The problems addressed by this book are (a) regex is poorly documented in general and (b) it has grown up ad hoc: every language's implementation is different from every other, sometimes very different.The book does a good job of documentation and explanation in the early chapters. But in the later chapters it falls prey to the problem it is trying to solve. If you use Perl or Java or VB.NET, then this book gives a lot of very important information not easily found elsewhere.On the other hand, if you use PHP, MySQL or JavaScript (as I do) you have to look elsewhere for the advanced topics."
5,Regex fun and games,"I bought this book to do some work on the firewall filters and the smtp proxy at work. I liked it a lot, it was pretty clear and to the point. They also have quite a few examples, tweaking them and using a regex tester got me up to speed and helped cut down on some spam hitting the user mailboxes.It's a great book, buy it if you need a working understanding and then keep an eye on what you've done to see how it works."
4,Nice comprehensive overview,"A nice look into the mechanics of regular expressions, starting from a birds eye view and diving down into the details."
5,Eureka!,"Okay, so maybe I'm no Archimedes, but this book suddenly illuminated the world of regular expressions for me. I'd toiled through three or four other books, some of them pretty good, without getting it.After just a few chapters of this one, I can finally say that I understand regular expressions and can use them to my advantage instead of just being vaguely aware that there is a better way to do what I've been trying to do.Don't wait, buy it now!"
3,Great subject - poorly written book,"Not just what the book tries to say, it is how it says. In this regard, this book falls short of its promiss.I hope the author will re-write/organize the book to make it fun to read and provide many little examples (eg. like Programming Perl, Perl Cookbook,etc..) to make it fun to read."
2,"Real disappointment on ""Perl Regular Expressions""!",The author should NEVER adovacate programming with readability(abstraction) and efficiency at the same time. Taking advantage of the perl internals(implementations) for the purpose of optimization in regular expression matching is the worst programming practice since dos era!
2,Unclear and a general disappointment,I found this book to be poorly written and a general disappointment. The entire book could have (and should have) been condensed to about 20 pages. I have yet to find it helpful vs. the reg. expression cheat sheet that comes with any Perl book.
2,verbose and over rated,"I got this book because it was highly recommended by two PERL experts, Tom Christiansen, and the author of EFFECTIVE PERL.But this 300 page book is written as if it were a novel and not a technical book. It could easily have been half the length, and I'm not exagerating. The long chapter on how NFAs & DFAs work will be of interest to few people.I expected to learn all sorts of cool tricks via regular exppressions and was dissapointed. Sure there are a few good examples, but at far too high a price in time involved and money.This book will only be of use to the very few people who are really into NFA theory. For most people, this is a wasteful book. Its possibly the worst, least useful technical book Ive read."
4,Good Information,"Many people only barely utilize regular experssions, having been unable to get more than basic expressions to work. There are a lot of reasons for this - shell escapes, man pages that are terse to the point of being cryptic, etc. This book is a clear and very readable trip through practical regular expression creation and application that will enable the reader to get the most out of grep, awk, perl and other programs that use regular expressions."
5,Great Regex Book,"I have known about regular expressions for a long time, but they have always been some kind of mysterious secret code. Recently I was reading something else that pointed out the power of regular expressions, so I decided it was time to learn regular expressions once and for all. After reviewing the available books on Amazon, I chose this one. I was not disappointed.After reading just the first few chapters, I have been able to put them to work and make my life a lot easier. As a software engineer, I'm always doing searches through code or search/replace operations. I am now able to do more precise searches and do search/replace operations I never dreamed were possible before.Learn regular expressions now! Get this book!"
4,What everyone else said...,"What more can I say besides what everyone else has said.This is a WONDERFUL and POWERFUL book on Regular Expressions.From just-beyond-beginner to advanced, this book provides a fantastic view into the world of Regular Expressions and the practical thinking involved with them. However, without at least a semi-understanding of the concepts you will not be able to get through the book very quickly.I walked away with MUCH more knowledge than I had expected to. This applies to not only regular expressions, but also to rational thinking/planning when it comes to data and programmatic analysis."
3,Very good book,"Das ist sehr gutes Buch und hilft mir zu verstehen, die grundlegenden ""regulären Ausdrücken"", dass man versuchen mit vielen verschiedenen Sprache Paradigma."
2,this book needs an editor!,"On the internals of regular expression matching, this book is without equal. I found this book to be an excellent source of information on constructing efficient regexps in Perl.Unfortunately, this book is also without equal when it comes to *poorly* presenting information.The tables are unreadable -- visually impossible to decipher, cryptic, cluttered. Edward Tufte could use this as book as a prime example of how not to present information.And it's a shame, because there's a wonderful book buried inside Mastering Regular Expressions.If this book gets proper attention from an ORA editor, I could easily give it 5 stars. In its present form, it's nearly unusable -- 2 stars.--Pat / zippy@cs.brandeis.edu"
5,Looking forward to another book by Jeffrey!,"I was struck by the language analogy that he gave in the introduction. It was then, that I knew, that I would end up buying this book and put an end to this reg. expr. mystery once and for all! O'Reilly has the reputation of publishing very technical, to-the-point books and authors like Jeffrey make it come true. I am really looking forward to another book on some other arcane topic by him"
2,Don't call me a reference book,"I found other books much more helpful on solving a sticky regular expression problem. The author himself sums up his attitude towards users who want to find the solution fast without reading his 'story'""Readers familiar with regular expressions might feel that they can immediately begin using this book as a detailed reference, flipping directly to the section on their favorite utility. I would like to discourage that.""So, for anyone with a problem and you think your are going to flip to a section and solve it, sorry, the author says he discourages that and you must read his story first.""To get the most out of this book, read it as a story first"".I would rather have an experienced expert focus on creating a book to solve problems, not show me how smart he is. And reference books should be writen as reference books and leave the stories to Tom Clancy."
1,Poorly assembled time waster,"I found little use for this book and I think any moderate to average perl programmer would have no need for it.The book itself is much too long and full of uninteresting fluff that only a few really lonely will bother to read. Luckily I didn't have to waste any money on this book, and I urge you not to waste yours.A book on this subject could have been interesting and helpful, but Jeff Fried ensures that you will get no joy nor use from reading it."
5,Excellent!,"I fought with Reg Expressions. Bash, Perl. I read this book. (Which still kicked my tail initially) By the time I actually 'understood' the last page, Everything else I was doing in Bash, and Perl just made sense. Suddenly stuff that took me weeks to do, I can do in a few minutes. Now I am working through 'Learning Perl' but understanding everything I read, because of the great foundation this book laid for me."
3,not enough examples,"A good general book on Reg Ex, but the basic problem is that its too broad. Since so many regular expression engines can be different it doesnt really spend enough time on any one to let you 'master' them.But its still a worthwhile read, and its a good companion for Programming Perl for the perl programmers."
2,Rick Sammons Complete Guide to Digital Photography,"I find the book lacking in detail for such a large book. He starts on a topic but there is no depth to it. For instance, I wanted to download and store images on the computer. The explaination was very shallow and basic with no real examples and recommendations. It seems to be a volume of very basic stuff on all the digital topics. I take exception with it being called a ""Complete Guide"". It was recommended in a review and my fault for not previewing it at a bookstore myself before purchase."
5,A common sense approach,"This book will provide you with both the te3chnique and the insights into the subject to oppen a whole set of new doors to photography... The author's professional background as well as his down to earth, simplified appreach, makes this book a welcome addition to my library."
3,Not for beginners,"The book is beautifully illustrated. The specific examples are good for those who already know more than the basics in photography. In order for this to be a great book, it would need more elementary information so that a novice could pick it up and apply the techniques discussed. While I would recommend the book for someone who already knows how to use a camera, I do not think it is a 'complete guide to digital photography.'"
2,"If your looking for photoshop help, go elsewhere.....","To be fair, Rick does have some good information in the book. However, almost all of the lessons and comments relating to processing images in Photoshop are confusing and sadly lacking accurate instructions on how to accomplish the various processing steps. It's one of those books that requires one to read, re-read and then re-read the instructions again thinking you missed something. Well, you didn't miss something; it's not there. I would hope a revision be done to provide more accurate details because I think the author is a very good photographer."
2,Surprisingly lacking,"This book is laid out for the absolute novice. Considering Sammon's long career in photography, I am really very surprised that this book does not have any inspiring photographs. Many of the lessons are repetitive - the same photos are used for various lessons and the same techniques are mentioned over and over again (i.e., photos - Hearst castle, Amazon Indians; techniques - nik Pro filters, Photoshop curves). And some lessons are almost unnecessarily inserted on a whim. Sammon has a well-deserved reputation as a photographer, but his take on digital photography does not do justice to this exciting field. It is an exciting time in photography, and Sammon fails to portray that excitement in his book. I would recommend Tom Ang or the ""How to Wow"" series of books for better content. I hope to see a more inspiring book from Sammon in the near future."
4,Good photo guide,"This book gives you some very good tips on how to improve your photographs. Excellent help with photo shop, (better than the photo shop help). The best part about this book and author is that if you have any questions, you can email Mr. Sammons. I had some questions about other books he has written and emailed him expecting not to hear back for several weeks. He responded the next day!"
3,Complete Guide to Digital Photography - my opinion,"While I like this book, and it does include a ton of useful information on various aspects of digital photography, I also have some criticisms. First, if you are not using Photoshop (CTS or Elements), this book will be of little value to you. Two-thirds (2/3) of the book is focused on techniques using Photoshop. Second, I am not a fan of the ""every section is a short lesson or tutorial"" approach. This often does not allow for in depth coverage of specific topics and can make it difficult to find specific topics. Finally, the CD/ROM included with the book is supposed to be a Tutorial, but is really a PowerPoint of selected chapters + some additional resources. It does not include photographs that are included in the book with before/after focus, which would be better. Overall, I think this book is good for someone who is making the transition from film to digital and/or someone who owns Photoshop and wants to learn more about how to use it."
2,No help for beginner in digital camera use,"Good photos, helpful pointers about taking pictures, too much info on use of Photoshop for beginners, assumption that the reader is using a prosumer camera, and almost nothing about how to use ""your new digital camera""...setting white balance, using all the controls built into these cameras, how to shift your ""mind-set"" from taking photos with a film camera to a digital camera...worthless book for a new digital camera user...and I've been taking B/W-Color photos for 40+ years and have my own darkroom."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"This book was just what I was looking for!Great information on picture-taking: composition, lighting, etc.Great information about digital photography: the hardware, connections, transfering pictures, and editing.Thanks, Rick."
5,Thrilling Francesca and Hamlet,"These are indeed ne-plus-ultra, sine-qua-non classic Stokowski performances, the most exhilarating performances of the 2 Tchaikovsky warhorse tone poems ever, recorded in in-your-face fabulous late'50s-audiophile scintillating stereo. The only other versions of the Tchaikovsky numbers that come close are those of Igor Markevitch on PhilipsTchaikovsky: Complete Tone Poems. The CD has AGAIN been reissued, this time shorn of the Scriabin/Houston Poem of EcstasyTchaikovsky: Francesca da Rimini; Hamlet (stokowski)."
3,Great - once we got one that worked!,"My mom, who has no technical skill whatsover, and I figured out together by telephone how to get the frame set and running. It worked for less than 24 hours, plunging us into a 2-month wrangle with Ceiva to get a replacement part that didn't solve the problem, then to replace the frame. I had to apply significant pressure to get them to extend the subscription and the warranty. They did, but the Mother's Day frame caused much distress for my mom in the process.Ceiva #2 worked like a charm. She loves it, and it allows her to see family events as they happen - a new great-grandchild, a new car, and her grandson's near miss in the San Diego fires!"
2,Watch Out for Subscription Rate Increases!,"We received a gift Ceiva photo frame in Mar 2003 with a local number in our area; they charged $90/yr subscription. Without warning, in Aug 2003, Ceiva cancelled all local"
2,Watch out for the subscriber rate increases!,"When we received a gift Ceiva photo frame in March 2003, there was a local number in our area and they charged us $90 for a year subscription. Then, without warning, in August 2003, Ceiva cancelled the number in our area and our Ceiva photo frame no longer worked. After many phone calls and frustrated hook-ups, the only option they gave us was to switch to a 1-800 number and pay double the fee, subsequently losing 1/2 of our remaining subscription. The only other option was to no longer have a Ceiva subscription and waste a lot of money on a product that we only used for 6 months. It's like Ceiva got family members to buy the product, then switched the subscription terms, then gave us an ultimatum - Pay more money to keep it working or lose your investment all together."""
1,World's Worst Service,"Ok...I know that probably 50% of all Ceiva frames are purchased as Holiday gifts, and they are overloaded with tech issues, but I have been trying to get through on their phone number for a week with no luck. Email hasn't been answered either.My unit died with in 30 minutes of operation. What little I saw was great, but now what?Web site execution for photo management is quite poor to boot. Stay tuned.."
2,Hit and Miss,"When I read about the Ceiva, it was exactly what I was looking for... an easy way to keep my family up to date with pictures, without having to mail them. The concept is great, but I was not very pleased with the performance or customer service. I have seen other frames that are linked directly to computers, which is the quality I was expecting on my Ceiva. This was definetely not the case. I order 4 units initially, but had to return 2 of them because the flickering was so bad it was difficult to see the picture. I received another 2 replacement units...and sure enough, 1 of those the flickering is bad enough that I am going to send it back as well. The flickering is definitely one issue that Ceiva needs to work out. <"
3,Logo is tacky,"Neat idea. I was going to get one for my Mom as she complains about the time and trouble to download pictures from the internet. But I see 2 serious flaws. First, the logo in front is really tacky and makes the whole device look like an advertisement generator. Second, it requires an $8/month subscription to an online service, rather than just use an existing internet connection. For $12/month I can get a full internet connection."
4,Cevia II on the way,"The Cevia people tell me that they are in the product testing phases for the Cevia II. It's not expected to be on the market until spring 2003 at the earliest. They are looking at adding memory card capability to it, so you can add photos directly to the frame without using the internet, but stated that a subscription will still be required. The subscription's a little spendy for what you are getting. Amazon[.com] won't let prices be shown, so let's just say the monthly fee is equivalent to an individual movie theater ticket.I did purchase the frame last weekend, which initially only allows 10 photos. It takes 3-4 times of the nightly automatic dial-in before the software will upgrade to allow the 20 photos to display."
1,Horrible customer service,"My mother loves the pictures of the grandkids, but the customer service is horrible. It's difficult to find the phone number (hint: look in the user guide). Each time I've had to call them, I've been on hold for over an hour. Each time I've sent them email, it's been over three weeks to get a reply.I tolerated the monthly subscription cost because she liked the pictures, but then the unit died (dead cpu, not a power supply problem) after only six months of service (but out of warranty so there is no replacement). Doing a little arithmetic with the purchase price, sales tax, and subscription fees, I find that I've spent thirty-five dollars a month for those pictures.Great concept, lousy customer service, bad quality control.I won't be buying another one."
1,A Great Idea but zero support,"A wonderful idea, and when it works it is really neat. But I had a heck of a time setting it up, had to throw out a perfectly good digital phone (it won't work with a digital phone anywhere in the house, Uiden and Vtech are hybrid digital, beware) and it took forever to get it to connect to the local phone line.Support is non-existent, I've sent three e-mails and never a response. Phone call (not an 800 number) take over a 1/2 hour to answer and you will be as knowledgeable as the tech support goof they connect you with. Frustrating.I love the idea, but they mislead you on the cost of the contract, which is way too expensive for the lousy service.It was a gift that has so far cost me $220 ($100 phone and $120 subscription service).Again, a great idea and a real pleasure while it works. But don't buy one for your parents or grandparents. When mine craps out that will be the end of it, I've never been this fed up with a company as I am with Ceiva."
1,Some Bad Features as well,"You need to subscribe to the service to use the picture frame with is an additional $49 per year.Also there isn't an option to upload from your PC or Camera direcly to the frame. It requires the use of their online service. IF you have a digial phone line, you can't use this either. you need an analog phone line so if you're in a corporate center most likely you can't use this at work."
1,Requires monthly subscription,It had a good quality display for the digital pictures; however it requires a monthly subscription to use it.
1,Ceiva Digital Photo Frame,"Unless you have a lot of money to throw away, and/or you plan on rotating digital images at least once a week, this is not a smart buy. With the high initial cost (...) and annual subscription (...), you can save much more money by having prints made of your digital photos (about $1/photo) and putting them in an old-fashion frame (that costs less than $20). Although the quality of the image is solid, you have to look straight into the frame in order to view it clearly (i.e., if you are looking at it from even a slight angle, you cannot see the image).And, don't forget that each frame has two wires protruding from it: one that connects to the phone line, and the other that connects to an outlet. In other words, you need to have the frame near both an electrical outlet and phone jack (not to mention you have to find a way to hide the wires).Wait until some decent form of digital photo frame is developed - and more much less."
1,Pay up!!,You have to pay a subscription just to change pictures. Why can't they allow you to connect it dirrectly to your PC?
1,Don't waste your time or money. It doesn't work.,"I wouldn't even give the Ceiva frame a star. The concept is amazing. And because of this, I purchased 3 of them to give as gifts for the holiday. None of the 3 worked. None of the replacements worked. Ceiva thought it extremely unusual to have such a situation happen. Yet if you read through the Amazon reviews, you'll see that it is extremely common. The product has lots of bugs...avoid it. Avoid the frustration and time. Argh!"
5,Not Lonely,"We got this frame for my mother-in-law, who resides in assisted living. It took some tinkering to get it to accept pictures when we took it from our house to her apartment, mostly because she has to dial 9 for an outside line, but that's all sorted out now. The other day she told me how much she liked it because now she ""doesn't feel lonely anymore."" That said it all to me! Also, it was so totally Jetsons that I wanted one for the fun of it! Maybe next Christmas!"
4,Brilliant Idea,"One of those rare products that truthfully does what it says, and says what it does. I purchased one for both my in-laws and my parents so they can watch our twins grow, and they are thrilled with the device. Low-tech interface requires little of them to set it up, so there is no techno-phobia concerns. Prior to giving them as Christmas gifts I played with them for a while myself. Now I'm back to order a 3rd unit for myself!"
1,Worthless without service,"It's a great concept, if customer support was responsive.As of the last two weeks of December, 2001, it is not.Unable to get through voice-call customer support.The web site is slow and loops me around endlesslywhen I attempt to purchase a subscription. Too bad."
5,Best gift ever!,"With our busy schedules it's been hard for family to stay in touch. Grandpa was celebrating his 87th birthday, so our family sent a Ceiva frame as we couldn't be there in person. We preloaded images into his account, and when he plugged the frame in, pictures and messages from our family were there! Now the whole family is sending he and Grandma pictures of the kids, puppies etc. It is incredibly easy to use! Product delivery was fast and the service is excellent! Bravo Ceiva!"
1,Very Poor Customer Service,"We purchased the Ceiva digital receiver last Christmas (2002) as a present for my parents. At the request of Ceiva's customer service department, we tried several different processes to get the frame operational. To date, the product has never worked (including a replacement). Actually, it worked 4 days out of 1 full year.We were appalled when Ceiva declined to give us a refund because ""it was too late"". We originally requested a refund in January 2003.This is a ""buyers beware"" company to deal with. They cater to deceptive business practices. You might think twice before dealing with them."
1,No Support,"I set one up for my Mom. Great idea and she enjoyed the pictures from our kids while still on vacation. But, like the other reviews, BLACK SCREEN. This happened 5 months after purchase.We contacted CEIVA's tech support by e-mail three times. Not one was answered other than the &quot;auto-reply&quot; acknowledgement. Searched the website for a phone number. None listed. Found these prior reviews about the faulty AC adapters. Couldn't even buy one!Went to Radio Shack with the frame and power supply to try other AC adapters. None worked, even with identical numbers. Back to trying for support but have not heard a thing.I don't think anybody's back there!"
2,Broken Frame,"I purchased this frame for my 75 year old mother in law in May of 2002. Since then I have had four A/C adapters replaced for the frame, and now the frame has stopped dialing. When I called Ceiva I was told it normally costs $100.00 to repair or replace, but if I act today it will only cost me $65.00. This after waiting one hour and ten minutes on hold. If there is one thing I hate, it is to forced into making a decision on the spot by pushy phone salesman. I told the woman to cancel my membership. To cancel the membership requires a $10.00 canellation fee and you only receive 50 percent of your balance. It could be a great product if it were a little more stable, or if it worked at all. Needless to say anyone who purchases a Ceiva frame be prepared for constant problems and poor customer service."
3,Good product but pray it doesn't break!,"I bought this to give to my parents on the recommendation of a friend that had one. It is perfect for the computer challenged grandparent that needs a regular fix of recent grandkid photos.I don't know if repairs are common, but if they are, god help you if it is out of warranty. I found out that Ceiva doesn't repair the units, has no way of doing so, and you'll go through a maze of uninformed GenY-ers in a futile effort to get any two that have the same sheet to talk from. Apparently they replace on a case by case decision, but everyone wants to talk to their supervisor and get back to you. It's like buying a car from a dealer with no service department, and they replace a defective car in the first three months, but after that, they have to discuss it at morning meeting and get back to you.Enjoy the technology, but be forwarned if you are unlucky enough to have a problem after three months."
2,Costly fact about multiple ceiva's,"I just recieved 3 ceiva frames that I purchased. One to each set of out-of-state grandparents, and one for my sister. During the on-line registration process to purchase the required annual subscription, I come to find out that EACH frame must have a separate subscription! That's close to [$$$]. bucks... per year!Holy Moly!Before I purchased, I read the reviews, checked their website, etc. Nowhere is this info revealed. In fact they even promote ""send pics to multiple frames"" on their website without mentioning this.Bottom line: Way too expensive for this guy, they're going back."
1,DO NOT BUY CEIVA FRAME!,"When I first found Ceiva frame I got very excited. It was a fascinating idea. I purchased five of them only to learn later what a waste of money it was. The problem is the design and the service Ceiva provides. Invariably every one of the frames I purchased had difficulty connecting and receiving picture. The website was not accepting the serial number of one of the frames. Each phone call you make to Ceive means at least 45minutes being on hold.The representatives are very poorly trained and just read a series of instruction to you which is completely useless.They never respond to your emails to their customer support service. It is extremely frustrating. Service is poor, unacceptable and lousy. DO NOT BUY CEIVA. I already returned mine."
2,Can't rate it from Canada...,"I am still trying to get over the embarrassment of giving a wedding gift that won't work. I first saw and fell in love with the Ceiva on a computer show featuring this device. The guy claimed that anyone could use this thing from anywhere. He failed to mention ""anywhere but Canada!"" If we're willing to pay the long distance charges (hey, what about the toll-free #) why are we not able to activate the thing. I don't know whether I should return it or wait until it becomes available worldwide."
1,False product advertising,"Product does not work in households with fiberoptic lines and does not work world wide on phone line, you need to have a wireless connection. After spending so many hours trying to get it to work, I just gave up and returned. It's not worth your time!!!!"
1,CEIVA was broken for months,"We got a CEIVA for our kid's grandmother, concept was great but the unit died two times and it takes weeks to get it repaired. Due to her age, she was not tech savvy so had to have someone else come over to work on it, pack and ship, reinstall, etc. Disappointing but was the only long distance photo option I could find - will be looking for a more reliable option.HH"
1,Ceiva is a RIP-OFF!!!,"I was very happy to recieve my new Ceiva picture frame but, from the moment it arrived I've been consistently dissapointed. First of all, it comes in the most drab looking cardboard box. This box looks like it belongs to a product being sold off the back of a truck, not at Amazon.com. While I still believe the concept is nice, the execution is horrible. The picture is unclear, skewed to the right, and grainy at times. The screen is obviously a cheap passive matrix LCD display, which leads one to believe that Ceiva spent the rest of the high retail price on Executive salaries. I think if I had seen the product for whjat it really was, I would have spent the money on a Sony model, or not purchased one at all."
1,"Ceiva: A unique idea, but not ready for prime time",I received my Ceiva digital photo receiver as a Christmas gift and it is not yet functional. It is a unique idea and a perfect gift for relatives and close friends to exchange photos of love ones. I have not been able to register my Ceiva because the Web site says that my serial number is not valid. I can not get into the Ceiva Tech Support as the phone is always busy and they have not answered my E-Mail message. This tells me that they are very busy solving problems. The only concern I have with the device itself is the picture quality. You must view the photos straight on as the contrast drops dramatically as you view from the sides. The quality is no where near that of a lap top computer. If it was it would be great.
2,Great Idea - quality not there yet.,"I bought this so that I could send my not-so technologically advanced parents pictures faster. Hook-up was easy as was operating, but the quality was not there: you have to stare straight at it from the 10 inches or so to see it well, like in the old laptops. Looks great though."
1,Great Idea Poor Execution,"Well the idea was great but Ceiva service hasn't caught up to the product. I bought 2 frames for my parents over the holidays. I spent over [price] on the frames and annual service thru Ceiva and have not got the frames operational. We checked the website and it was down. We called the 1-800 and spent over 8 hours on hold and never spoke to a single rep. I am trying to get my money back for the service and haven't been able to reach any one. I am in the process of filing a claim with the BBB and the Ca. Attorney General's office.If you are drawn to this technology, stay away from Cevia and look for frames that allow you to update directly into the frame."
3,Its day will come but it's not today.,"It's a brilliant idea, there's no doubt about that. A picture frame that you can give to someone and whose contents you yourself can then update from a website. The downside is the implementation. The picture quality can best be described as fair. The colours are somewhat muted and the resolution not particularly high. The pixels are quite noticeable and positioning has to be just so.Given the price, I wish I'd waited a few months since I'm sure better versions will be on the way soon. There's no leading edge technology involved so there's no reason why the idea couldn't be implemented to a much higher quality very soon."
4,Awesome but ...,The good news is that this is an amazing product that everyone who sees it wants. The bad news is that this is an amazing product that everyone who sees it wants. Which is why I have bought four of these frames to date and it has put a hurtin' on my Amex card! Once you get passed that you will bask in the raves and envy of your parents neighbors. The picture is as clear as a Sony Trinitron. The setup is a simple as plugging in a phone and making a call. And for allowing those far away to feel closer there are few competitors to 20 photos every two weeks.
1,"Gift for 90 year old grandparent, only lasted 1 year, so sad","I got this as a gift for my 90 year old grandfather. At this point in his life he lives to see the pictures the family sends him. He cannot be without his frame. He lives in a nursing home. And now what happens? The frame burns out after one year plus a few days. I start doing some research and I read here that this happens to lots of these frames. They didn't offer extended warranty when I first bought it. So now I am stuck. Either I have to tell him ""no more pictures"", or I have to fork over another $125 for a new frame. We still have several months left on his subscription. Chalk me up as Ceiva's latest victim. The frame is just not made to last. You'd think for the price, it would last at least a couple of years. GEEZ LOUISE! I am shopping for my grandfather a replacement device, but by another manufacturer. I won't let him down."
1,Piece(s) of junk,"Wow, what low performance following such high expectations. Bought a receiver and bit the bullet, signing up for 3 years, despite feeling like a sucker for falling for such a blatant subscription ploy. The marketing team clearly won out over the designers - leaving out a serial or picture card input is downright sinister.First Ceiva showed up DOA - no life whatsoever. Frustrating after signing up on line, uploading images, paying subscription fee. Returned the unit.Second unit. Dead after 24 hours. I'll try anything five times, but not in this case. They suckered me twice, but no more.What happened to quality control? Seemingly it is not a priority at Ceiva."
4,Nice gift.,I recived my new Ceiva and it works good. The colors are a little washed out. I would like to know how they got all the color in the sample photos! Anyway afer looking at it I found an unacceptable amount of dust and lint behind the glass. I called Amazon and they are sending me another one. The people at Amazon.com are to be complemented on there handling of returned goods.
2,"Nice idea, mediocre quality, poor support","This frame is a great idea, but don't buy one yet. The Web site which you need to support the frame is poorly designed and definitely NOT ready for prime time. Image quality is mediocre and the design of the frame has significant shortcomings.If you have a question or need to contact this company -- GOOD LUCK. The frequently asked questions would only be asked frequently by a moron and there appears to be no practical way to contact a living human being by e-mail or telephone. Ceiva is already becoming infamous despite its short existence for poor customer support and relations.The concept is great, the execution is not. Wait to buy the product with the needed, inevitable and easily envisioned improvements from a company which will still be here next year."
5,my new ceiva frame,"I recently purchased a ceiva frame and so far I am thrilled. I was very nervous because I thought it would be difficult to set up (my VCR has been blinking 12:00 for 7 years) well, it was easy! It was so easy in fact, that I ordered one for my mother in Florida. She does not have a computer and is less technical than I am - she loves it! I am able to send her new pictures every day - it is a great way for us to stay connected. It is a great addition to my living room, it looks like a regular frame and serves as an incredible conversation piece. I have had several friends come over who are just amazed - I have added them to my buddy list, and now they send me their pictures as well. I am able to watch my best friends baby grow up eventhough we live thousands of miles away. The ceiva frame is a wonderful product, every house should have one."
5,What a connection!!!,"We all live in a hectic world, running around busy with our lives, but CEIVA's Digital Receiver has been the perfect gift to keep our family connected everyday! It's easy to set up. Just log onto their web site and register as a member. Then register your Receiver (you need to purchase a subscription), but it's definitly worth it, and you're on your way. Directions are easy to follow, and the value of being in touch with family each day is truly pricless. I had a few questions about their rebate, and support was a bit tough to reach (busy from post holiday clean up, according to the rep), but they were very friendly and helpful. This has been the best gift we could have ever given!"
2,technical support required,"I purchased the Ceiva picture frame for my elderly grandmother about 7 months ago. The frame is great if you are going to give it to someone who doesn't mind doing a little technical support. I would say on average every four weeks the frame freezes up. It requires a little fiddling with, sometimes a call to technical support, but nothing that takes more then a couple of minutes. As long as you don't mind that kind of thing the frame is pretty cool. It's a little manual if you want to constantly rotate new sets of photos, but easy enough to do. Bottom line though, if you are thinking of giving this to someone who is unable to perform technical support (like my 90 year old grandmother) and you don't live close enough to them to drive out there to fix it for them, then don't buy it."
5,Great For Non-computer literate grandparents,"We got the frame for my mother-in-law for mothers day last year and she loves it. You can store up to 1000 pics on the the Ceiva Web site for it to download to the frame. Only draw back, which is not publicised is the fact that it cost $... a month for the subscription ($... if you do it for 3 years).The frame calls a local number to download at night and downloads the pics (up to 20). You set the frame from your computer (times to come on and go off ) it makes it easy for the non-compter literate to use."
1,Don't Buy!!,"My mother has a Ceiva and it has been more trouble than it's worth. I have called Ceiva 7 times this week. After being on hold more than 30 minutes each time, I have gotten different instructions every time and still nothing works. Their support staff knows absolutely nothing!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS POOR PRODUCT,"This is not a grandma/grandpa friendly product. To really get the most out of this product you must have a computer. I purchased one some time ago with failures within a few months. I called and also spent a great deal of time on hold. Since I live in Southern California I dropped in to complain. Turns out they had bad adapters -they gave me a new adapter but eventually that one failed too. As far as having more than one location, HA!The company has ONE location, in Burbank, CA where the executive offices and everything else is housed. It is a pretty high end rent district and contemporary offices. From my time there I could tell the customer service dept. was there and I heard programmers upstairs as well. Also the price of the subscription has increased dramatically (early on it was $49 now it's double that). My in-laws bought one too before my problems but now both frames sit in the closet. Save your money and keep your frustration level down!"
3,Nice product -- when it works!!,"A great ""Grandparents"" gift -- my mother doesn't even use email, so this is a great way to send her photos of the kids, and she loves it. Picture quality is not great, but is adequate. The Big Problem is, we are already on our second frame after having numerous hardware problems with the first one. Customer service was okay once you could get a human to speak with you, but this was hard to achieve. They sent out a new power cord once, which fixed the first ""burn out,"" but meanwhile we were paying for the service and not getting any pictures. We demanded (and received) an extension of our subsctiption service for the time it was not working, but they were not about to offer this. Then the frame died for good, about 12-18 months after buying it. We did choose to buy another one since my parents loved it so much, and so far we have had no problems with the second frame for one year..."
1,Not a fan,Received this unit for Christmas by a giver who was assured at time of purchase that it would work in our phone area. It didn't. Trying to resolve the problem via their website is not possible. Phone calls to customer service resulted in being put on hold for 30 minutes or more with no contact made. Be very careful that you can actually use this item in your area before purchasing. It is an intersting idea not backed up by customer support
1,Keep this number handy.. you'll need it.,"1-877-MYFRAMEBy the way.. you won't find this number anywhere on their website. They'd prefer you email them, so they can ignore you.Frame went out after just going over the warranty period, which is a whopping 90 days. This is after they replaced the power adapter (that was part of a huge batch of bad ones that were sent with many frames.) They'll be happy to sell you a refurbished model for $65 more dollars, though..."
3,Great While It Worked,I purchased a Ceiva for my mother last Christmas and received one as a gift. My mother enjoys her Ceiva but my receiver just died; it did not last even one year! There is a 90 day warranty but you should purchase the extended one year warranty for another $19.95. This last month the website's local number availability tool did not even recognize my telephone number. Now I see they have updated the receiver for November 2003. I will not be buying a new one at this time.
2,"Great Idea, Poor Implementation","This is such a good idea it hurts, but the execution is dissapointing.Set up was a breeze and the web site is friendly and intuitive. The problem is that the 12-bit color and passive matrix display produces images of poor quality. There is noticiable dithering and color aliasing, and photos are hard to see from the side.I'm sure a year from now they will come out with a model aith 16-bit color and an active matrix screen. And it will probably cost 1/3 as much.I suspect my parents will still like this, but it's not as gfood as it could be."
2,The Gift of Dissapointment,"What a wonderful idea. Too bad it doesn't live up to it's intentions. I bought the frame as a gift, hoping to bring some magic of technology and a constant flow of grandson photos to my parents who will NEVER get a computer. All I brought them after driving a hundred miles and setting everything up both on my computer and at their home was a big dissapointment.The screen is so poor, it is not like a lap top screen it is more like an early game boy which means you have to be at just the right angle to view it and still the photos are totally washed out. Sony makes one for about three times the price but Ceiva was trying to make their's affordable. Even the guy at the Ceiva tech help agreed that the way technology is going there could be a GOOD affordable Ceiva in the future. Sadly the future is not here. I'm returning mine."
3,Great if you live in the city,"The unit itself is great, and the website is fairly intuitive. The problem I ran into was the availability of local phone numbers. I live in rural Kentucky, and the only local #'s available are in Lexington and Louisville- both hours away. It cost me an extra $60 to get a toll-free phone number. So, check the website for availability of local phone #'s before you buy."
4,A GREAT Surprize,"I bought this for my father who live cross country. It was easy to set-up, especially with the ""Live"" customer support available. I was walked through uploading and saving pictures on the internet to my Ceiva account. It is so easy even my 7 year old is able to save and send pictures to his grandfather. The added bonus is that my children are getting closer to their grandparents eventhough they live 2000 miles apart. I love Ceiva, my kids love Ceiva and my Parents and really enjoying it."
4,"Good product, poor service","The ""Photo Receiver"" Frame works great once set up. Picture is good especially straight on, but the service is lousy: It's hard to contact them; one power supply burned out, (an apparent problem, though their website walked me thru ordering another one free--which appears to be the same design); I couldnt get my first rebate cuz I threw away the box it came in (note rebate seekers); and I asked in an email why a 12 week wait is neccessary (their estimate) for an online order rebate on another order. I'm still waitng for a reply to that email after a week."
4,"Easy to set up, Reasonable picture quality, Expensive","I bought two of these -- one for my parents, and one for myself. I got my own frame set up with photos downloaded to it in about an hour. My father also set his up without any trouble.I have my frame subscribing to the Local Weather Channel, and to This Day in History, so I get both the weather forecast and interesting tidbits of history daily, in addition to the photos.The display is fine, though I'd be interested in a higher quality one. I agree that the subscription to the Ceiva Network is pricey. I like that they allow you to purchase gift certificates for the subscription."
3,WHERE'S MY REBATE?!?!,"I was told on January 9th that my rebate paperwork had been received and validated and should be expected within 30 days. Well, it's been 2-1/2 months, and when I inquire, they just e-mail the same form letter over and over. Where's my money?!?!I gave it three stars only because my mother just loves seeing updated pictures of her grandchildren. Certainly not for the horrible customer service."
2,Good when it works!,I have purchased over 8 ceiva frames. When recieved the first it was great and I recomended it to the whole family. So they everybody bought a ceiva frame. Then one by one start having problems. ALL OF THEM BROKE! Eight different frames in Eight different homes. We have sent them back to ceiva for repairs and Ceiva sends them back in the same condition. Ceiva's tech support is not good. It's shame cause they have a good product.Bottom line is ceiva frame are great when they work. But they all go bad. So if you buy a ceiva frame get the extended warranty. Therefore when it breaks wait the 10 weeks for tech support to send it back and pray they send it back in working condition.
2,Not customer oriented. Hard to get help with their product,"I have one of their frames that I gave to my father. It developed some problems. Their web site does not provide any telephone customer support phone number. None. Look before you buy. I emailed them my phone number and asked them to call. They emailed back a non-solution and refused to call me. This is arrogant.When the frame is within a few weeks of having its subscription expire, it starts flashing messages telling you to renew. This is while your subscription is still current. I don't mind an email reminder, which they also send, but in addition to not letting you talk to them, they think they can grab space on your frame for their content."
3,"OK, but Microsoft TV Photo Viewer is a better choice","Ceiva Internet Photo Frame is nice, but I also bought a Microsoft TV Photo Viewer and like this much better. The Microsoft viewer lets you show photos on a big-screen TV instead of a little picture frame, and comes with a nifty simple remote control. It does not require any special internet service or phone connection.Microsoft include software that lets you make albums of up to 40 photos (vs. 20 for Ceiva), and then you just e-mail the album to someone else who has the viewer. They can copy the album from the e-mail attachment and see the photos on their own TV.Worth checking out as an alternative."
4,Web interface needs improvement,"A great product idea, and (mostly) well-executed. The LCD is not as good as the higher-end photo frames, but this is probably what keeps the price down. My main criticism is the design of the Web site -- seems rather klunky -- requires too many screens and steps to get basic tasks done; for example, to re-arrange the order of photos. Also, I'd like to see configuration options available in the frame itself rather than just on the Web site."
1,NOT HAPPY AT ALL with this PRODUCT,I purchased three of these as gifts for relatives that live hundreds of miles away as a means of staying in touch.I am VERY UNHAPPY with this product. It is EXPENSIVE to purchase and get's even MORE EXPENSIVE because you have to subscribe to the service! I bought 3 of these and had to pay for 3 separate subscriptions. (One subscription / frame).Their web site is slow (and I have a cable modem!)and very clumsy to use. You can only load photos of very low resolution ( read low quality).The users of the frame must place this frame in a place where you can attach it to a phone line and a power outlet (always very attractive to have the wires everywhere).You are much better off sending pictures via email!! Even if you have computer phobic friends it's a lot cheaper to snail mail higher quality photos.
5,"clear,crisp tones with great empathy for the music.","one of the best interpretations I have ever heard of the piano concerto; done with great insight and feeling, yet restrained in all the right places; good balance throughout."
1,Political correctness in India,"I bought Let's Go and was not impressed. It does not hold a candle to ROUGH GUIDE or Footprint. The practical information is fine but it is written in such a campus political correct fashion which becomes grating after a while. I know they are politically correct in Harvard Yard, but their writing of history is so smug and black and white. It also is ridiculously Amero-centric. They tend to forget that other nations read the book, or they don't care. From now on I will give it a wide berth. ROUGH guide, Footprint and Lonely Planet are not written for one nation in mind - this is why they work so well."
5,I bought it in order to stop colliding with things,"I'd just moved to a new place, which was adjacent to an untenanted, forested lot and consequently darker on the inside than my old place. I bought two nightlights, so as not to be colliding with walls/furniture when I occasionally had to get out of bed to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. I also wanted to be able to make coffee in the dark, because I detest bright lights in the morning, at least until I'm fully awake. I wanted a light source that was not too hard on the eyes, but still bright enough to see by. These nightlights did just what I wanted them to do: provide just enough light, not too much. The light is reminiscent of the glow that emanates from a small TV, only more muted, more diffuse, and very, very blue. I give them a five star rating, because they were what I wanted."
5,Love the Blue Flame Lights,"We have about a dozen of these lights in the halls, rooms, and bathroom on the basement level of our house. We love them - they hardly use any power (0.5W), they require no maintenance at all, they give just the right amount of light - you can walk around safely without turning on any additional lights, and they look cool."
3,Too dim,"I wanted to replace a 4-watt incandescent nightlight in my bathrooms.I find this blue LED too dim, about half the light of my incandescent. I was able confirm that, because I bought 2 of these blue LED lights, and plugged them both in at the same location. I would have been happy if one unit provided the light of two.Next I'm going to tryMaxxima 2 LED Night Light With White Lens (Pack Of 2). I'll update this review when I've tried them.Edit: the Maxxima has worked out great. Had them for several months now. The light level is perfect and no performance problems whatsoever."
3,CVJ,"This night light is okay, but not very bright. There isn't much else that I can say about it, except maybe that it was reasonably priced."
3,Nice light but....,The light itself is exactly as advertised and shines a nice blue but I did not realize it had no on/off switch which I needed. I should have read more carefully about the product.
2,"Looked cool, but short life....","It definitely displayed a vibrant cool blue color light, but it died shortly after I had it. Very displeased with this."
3,cryptic item description,"This item looks like a night light, but it's always on - there is no ""on-at-dusk/off-at-dawn"" sensor. The light is a nice blue, although it's impossible to be sure from the picture.It works well enough, but it's not the night light I was buying based on the description."
3,This book was alright...,"I thought this book was okay. It deffinitly wasn't the best book I ever read. It got off to a very boring beginning and I had a hard time getting past the first two chapters. Once it gets going though, it becomes much more interesting."
2,I thought this book was really different but interesting.,"Lois Prochaska; This book was like none I'd ever read before. I related to the main character in the way that she always wanted to prove people wrong when they said she couldn't do something, but, also like me, it got her in trouble sometimes. However, I have my own idea about how things happened and will happen in the future, and mine didn't quite fit the ideas in this book, but I think it's interesting to learn other peoples' theories and such."
2,Enjoyable flick,"First half good, second half not so good. I think Brolin was terrific as Gable. I think he nailed the character. Clayburgh was good as well. As I said, it was quite enjoyable for an hour, then it just lost control of its story and its charm. Too bad. The actor who played L. B. Mayer was great. He had all the best lines."
4,Enjoyed the Storm,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a little short, but still enjoyable. Brenda Jackson is a great writer, and I appreciate the happy endings. We all need a ""Storm"" in our lives. Thanks Brenda for doing it again!!!"
2,Not very good,"I really didn't like this book. I've read a few Brenda Jackson books and found them to be interesting enough to continue reading them. This book however, I found to be lacking..corny and unrealistic. I couldn't wait to get through it. The dialogue is stiff and formal. This was not a good read for me."
3,"Silly heroine, yummy hero","I would give it more stars but for the silly plot devise of a 26 year old woman feeling her biological clock is ticking so decides on artifical insemination, how ridiculous is that. Plus still going for this option after the love/crush of her life declares his love, I wanted to slap her silly. If she was 36 or 40 I could understand the need for A.I. (how about that, make one of these gorgeous Westmorland men fall in love with an older woman for a change!). Apart from that I enjoyed the book, hot, sultry sex scenes, contraception that fails (just like real life) and the typical wedding one month later- lol."
1,I didn't receive the book!,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS BOOK!!! I was emailed and told that they (Amazon) could not locate a book. I would still love to have it!
2,Not for small hands,"This is pretty in picture, but not for small hand like mine. I am asian 5f tall, and have pretty tiny hands so if you do, this ring looks like a toy ring because this ring is very flat and the perl is just sticking out from the center. If you have big hands, this will be fit very nice..."
5,Gorgeous Ring,This is a gorgeous ring with a stunning setting. The quality of the settings are superb and is an eye catcher!
2,Where is my pearl,"The ring is very beautiful, the rose quartz is pale pink and very clear. The ring was nice for about a week, then I noticed a gaping hole where my pearl was suppose to be. I' m not the person who wears jewelry only on special occasions, I buy them to wear them. Pretty ring, but too delicate for everyday wear."
5,It's Steve and it cooks,"Typical Steve Lukather product. Great production, flawless performance. Simon Phillips is on drums along with a stellar line up. Smells a lot like Toto, but who has a problem with that? I love it. Also check out ""Lukather"". It's from '89 and has songs co-written with Eddie Van Halen, Richard Marx, Steve Stevens and a host of other buddies."
5,There are guitar players... and Lukather,"On Candyman you can hear the real Steve Lukather, groovy, jazzy and of course his trade mark rock sond. This is probably the best guitar album of the 90's. Luke has that power, every of the songs has a special flavor on it... definitively Steve is the best guitar player on the contemporary rock scene, he has shown that highly. buy this one, you won't regret, it will be sounding in your mind for a long time after you have turn your stereo off"
4,biker outfit adorable,this outfit is gaurenteed to make your kid smile . this outfit fits perfect on webkinz .My kid loves it her exact words were how adorable . She keeps it on her webkinz all the time i highly recomend it
2,Hm.... Not sure about this one.,"I lived in Japan for several years, and speak Japanese. My toddler son is also learning Japanese and I thought this would be a good introduction for him to understand the concept of the country called Japan. It was very skimpy on cultural education. I had hoped the wonders or customs of Japan would be highlighted. Instead, Big Bird gets lost and meets a sad woman who ends up being the bamboo princess. It is all quite subtle and lost on most children, I would guess. Most of the songs are English, not Japanese.I was quite disappointed with this video! On a positive note, I was surprised to see that my 2 year old son seemed to be interested in it. We'll see if it can hold his interest the 2nd time through.... I'm doubtful. I know Sesame Street can do better highlighting a culture!!"
5,2 yr old loves it,"My Daughter will watch all 60 minutes from start to finish. She adores this movie and loves to say quotes from it. I thought it was a little slow for such a young child, but I guess I was wrong."
3,Not what I expected,"The boots are pretty, but the heel is not as high as described and the interior is a very cheap black polyester fabric over thin foam. They're very oddly constructed. They have holes in the sides with mesh over them. Cheap non-leather bottom and they were scuffed when I got them from Amazon. I wouldn't have paid anywhere near $200 if I saw them in a store - they're $50 boots."
3,"Doesn't have that ""zip"" of juniper trees or berries","I was expecting more of a juniper berry flavor - but this had a mellow, more sweet flavor - not the zip of piney juniper that I love in gin. I was going to add this to carbonated water or tonic to eliminate my ""need"" for a gin and tonic in the evening, but this was more of a fruity flavored extract. This may be just me, though, but if you're considering this as a gin substitute, this ain't it."
1,Avoid at all costs,"Way too many errors in this book both analytically and historically. The author doesn't seem to know that Max Euwe was once World Champion. He refers to him as a ""contender for the world championship."" Schiller also writes that Petrosian became world champion in 1966 and lost the title after three years. In fact, Petrosian defeated Botvinnik in 1963 and was world champion for six years. He was the only champ to successfully defend his title (in 1966) since Alekhine.And the concluding paragraph for one game actually belongs to a game in another chapter.A very sloppy production.The author put Bobby Fischer's name on the cover to sell the book and didn't care about content. There is nothing worthwhile here."
2,How to make money from a famous chess champion...,"As Alburt's book ""Three days with Fischer..."", this book tries to sell Fischer's name and games before everyone realizes it's good and very easy in this computerized age. The author tries to race with Keene to crank out one book every two months or so. At this rate, the analysis depth is as good as in 5 second-move games. If we enjoy the second-hand stories and/or some personal opinion, this book is a good investment. 5 USD is good enough for this redundant collection of Fischer's games, condering 30-50 USD for an original book by Fischer offered at this Borders/Amazon site."
4,Not a history book,"I wasn't aware of some of the historical errors in the book when I started reading it. Surely the mistatement about Euwe is a error. But the book isn't intended as a history book.The value of the book is it illustrates common techniques that successful players use, like opening development, open files, etc illustrated in the games of Bobby Fischer. The narrative is easy to read, and there are at least one positional diagram per page.If it weren't for the historical inaccuracies, I would give the book 5 stars."
3,"Too gnarly, dudes!","What a strange flavour is tasted by the ears when Gongzilla strut their stuff. What a suprise when Benoit Moerlen unleashes his mighty vibes and marimba. The effect is that of a very cranky Caribbean Jazz Project possessed by the dead hand of prog rock. Everybody is so very INTENSE, every bar of the final result so brimming with energetic hammering of the Gongzilla charter. 'Yea, though few may hear our groove we swear to be as gnarly as possible, yea, unto the very last beat of the very last bar'. You have to hand it to them, they certainly were trying. Recommended for fans of some of your King Crimson."
1,a dumpster,"Time Zone by Wilfred Satty is an attempt at imitation of Max Ernsts brilliant ""Novel in Collage"" form of expression. These are poorly conceived, poorly executed, and poorly intended peices of trash. If you like the idea, don't look at this book- It's just a hack inflicting his slimy work on people.Buy Une Semaine de Bonté by Ernst, a purely beautiful landmark in art."
3,I grew up in the Five Towns,"A trip down memory lane for me -- the stores, the high school, the beach clubs, the description of the starter house, which was exactly the house my parents purchased, etc., etc. Whether it would have appeal to anyone other than a former Jewish American Princess from Long Island is doubtful."
2,book onto cd,i thought that this would be a book here it is a CD. i would of preferred the book over the CD at least you will not have worry about damage to the book as much CD. 1 thing not a complaint but on the cover shows a boy nude made me think it is a naturist book here that is a lie. convenient but easy to loose. yeah has a couple of hundred pages in the whole book some of theme are great. but the pictures are so small you can zoom in but that can get old.
4,WWE Money In The Bank 2012 *LIVE* Review,"This was a very fun and entertaning! All the matches were very entertaing, except the divas match & the Ryback match. The crowd was hot all night! During the unannounced matches, the crowd had no interest. But during every other match, the crowd was amazing especially during the Punk & Bryan match. The biggest pop of the night though was when Ziggler tried cashing in his Money In The Bank Contract! All in all, great PPV, It could have been better without the last minute matches, but the announced matches definately made up for it. Can't wait for the DVD! Definately worth watching! 8.5/10"
2,not worth it,"If you want pretty lights and big self-promotion then you will watch the New York ""entertainment"" with its constant repeat stale matches and over-hyped, over priced pay per views.I am been a wrestling fan for over 30 years and TNA is wrestling!!I have seen moves and matches in TNA that have ""wowed"" me and never expect to see from New York."
4,Dreaming about Flying? Orville Wright did.,"This is a great book. One of my favorite quotes is when Orville was asked when he got the biggest ""kick"" out of the invention of the airplane, was it the first flight? ""No"", Orville said, ""I got more thrill out of flying before I had ever been in the air at all-- while lying in bed thinking how exciting it would be to fly."" For many of us who fly, we can understand this as we spend more time on the ground dreaming then in the air. -- Ross"
5,a new side of hawai'i,"in his empathic and diverse oral histories of some mahu and transgender individuals on Oahu, andrew matzner opens a window on hawai'i lesser known cultural features. of great interest to the academic community in gender studies, as well as non-specialists interested in Hawaiian culture."
1,it could have been better,this thing did not fit in my 1992 lexus may it could be adjusted i just dont know how cut my finger on the darn thing
5,Youthanasia,"This is one of the greats in Megadeth's army of unstopable Heavy Metal power. The songs are amazing, there wasnt one i didnt like. The first song Reckoning Day was a song no metal head can forget. And Family Tree (number 8) had an infectious chorus and gets stuck in your head for days. Over all,its worth the money."
1,More Religious Fear-Mongering Disguised as a Book,"Another in a long line of books with the goal of finding the devil in everything. The author presents his arguments to those who seem to already be fundamentalist Christians. In a sense he is preaching to the choir. Now for rational, free thinking folks there is absolutely nothing you haven't heard before and certainly nothing to convince you to check your closet every night for the Biblical boogey-man."
3,Biogeography,The book is alright. A bit repetative but if you are just starting out with geography I would recommend going to a library instead of spending money on the purchase. It would be useful as an index if you are going to pursue geography
4,"It's good, but too expensive","I've read the Chinese version of the book. It's very useful. So I wanna buy its English edition only to find that it's too expensive. With 160 pages only,how can it be priced at more than $280?!"
5,"Great, superb album","De lezers van Christianity Today verkozen veteraan Ashley Cleveland tot Best Female Vocalist. Eerder kreeg ze dezelfde titel met een Grammy. Met haar 2006 release, Before The Daylights Shot, dat ik helaas pas kortgeleden aanschafte (had ik eerder moeten doen!) mag ze van mij zo weer die titel krijgen. De rauwe bluesrock past haar als een leren jack. Of het nu de remake van Stevie Wonder's Higher Ground, de bijbelse geschiedenisles van Queen of Soul of de ingetogen I Need Jesus, de titeltrack of de Streams of Mercy zijn, de CD is geweldig. Andere toppers zijn Ready or Not, Satisfied with Drowning en Leon Russell's Roll Away the stone. De waarheid blijft eenvoudig: ""Wrestle with the devil, that's a losing game/ Baby, run for the blessing now/ He'll come back to you by a different name/ Run for the blessing now."" Met manlief Kenny Greenberg andermaal als producent, hoop ik dat Cleveland het zingen en gitaarspelen nog jaren volhoudt!"
2,Not what I expected,"OK, so I got suckered in by the trailer. I thought it was going to be a documentary (informative, tragic and/or heartwarming) about 22 pugs, their late owner, and what happens to the dogs afterwards. It's really a low-budget mockumentary that focuses on a collection of nutty NYC neighbors and characters, playing them for laughs. I gave it two stars - one for each small chuckle I managed to get during the 25 or 26 minutes of running time."
1,Sony lost my business on this one,"How can such a large company as Sony that makes such great LCD displays, NOT make them VESA standard wall or arm mountable?!?. Try finding a wall mount kit for this display. You CAN'T!. Sony doesn't make one, nor do third party mfg's. I spent an hour trying to find one! If Sony wants to make the mounting configuration proprietary then they should AT LEAST step up to the plate and actually MAKE a wall mount kit. Sorry Sony, you lost my money on this one. I'll have to go with the 3 little colorful birds brand."
4,Good book but poor binding,This seemed to serve as a good introduction to Chinese dress through the perspective of the collection that was being built in Australia on which the book is based. The binding seemed of poor quality--the cover seperated from the glue on the spine on the first read.
2,Wonder Woman: Spirit of Truth,"Not what I expected. This is not a graphic novel, but a retrospective on the legend of Wonder Woman. I wish there had been a review of the contents (no real plot!)."
3,An ok collection,"This is a budget collection. It contains some of the songs from the now out of print 3rd and final Edgar Winter Group album which was originally released on the Blue Sky label in the mid 1970's. That album was not a hit and the group disbanded soon after its release. While this collection is nowhere near as good as the greatest hits collections, it is worthwhile for Edgar Winter Group fans that are looking for those hard to find songs like ""People Music"" and the price is cheap. Casual fans would be better off sticking to one of the greatest hits collections."
5,PLEASE Reissue,"This is one GREAT overlooked item from a very short-lived group. Terrific stuff, with stunning vocal harmonies, great musicianship, and first-rate songwriting. Can we PLEASE get a remastered reissue (the LP was not optimal, though not BAD), 'cause my vinyl version isn't gonna last forever and the digital copy I made of it isn't really up to an audiophile's standards."
5,This is a great help for hands on learners.,"I love this, it has made math so much easier for my daughter to understand. She has Down Syndrome and needs to use manipulatives to understand how math works, this book is wonderful it teaches me how to explain and simplify math for my 9 year old."
3,effective but not thorough,"I am using this book as my text for my upper mathematics bridge class. The text is certainly useful, but often I am frustrated by the lack of clear explanations for theorems, relegating them as exercises for the reader. I am not saying that the author should spoon feed the reader, but what do we do when we get stuck? For what we pay for this book, it certainly has some improvements to make."
3,Shoe runs small,The shoes are adorable and the quality is great! I would have loved to have given 5 stars but the shoe runs small. My daughters true shoe size is 11.5 so I ordered a size 12 to be safe...it wouldn't go on her foot. I thought that maybe the wrong size was shipped but I couldn't make that determination because the shoe is not labeled with a shoe size. Too bad! Beautiful shoe :-)
4,THE COVER IS A 10****...........,"I SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF THIS BOOK LOOKING AT THE COVER AND FINALLY DECIDED THAT TO SHOW 'THAD'S' FACE, HANDSOME THOUGH I'M SURE IT WAS, WOULD DETRACT FROM THE COVER. IT IS SOOOO HOT!!!IN THE BOOK, THAD IS WONDERFUL. ALL THE THINGS U WANT IN A HERO PLUS A BIT MORE VULNERABLE AND DOMESTICATED THAN MOST HEROS. HE'S A NEW BREED OF 'STAR' AND A REAL KEEPER. 'MERCY' DIDN'T DO MUCH FOR ME. SHE'S A TOUGH COOKIE AND THE READER ONLY GETS TO SEE BENEATH THAT A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE STORY. SHE IS JUST ABOUT THE PERFECT 'COWBOY' BUT I THOUGHT OUR HUNK DESERVED A BIT MORE 'WOMAN'. A GOOD READ BUT NOT A KEEPER ON MY SHELF."
3,it was good..,this book was pretty good but i wish i had know that it had a sequel to it.. buy them both and read them in order..loving mercyloving Miranda
2,The Doctor and the unicorns?,"The TARDIS' ongoing problems worsen, and an emergency landing brings the Doctor and Ace to a small Welsh village. Strange creature from legend have been spotted, and a stone circle contains the gateway to another world...The concluding book in the Cat's Cradle trilogy, this one is plainly the work of a first-time author. While every author must write a first book, that is not necessarily ever published. Mr. Hunt shows that he needed more experience to make this book work. I could give a list of faults, but basically they all come down to that he doesn't understand how a book works. This is not to say that he has no potential!Add to this that it is of a type that I don't like (explaining myths and legends as science fiction) means that it certainly wasn't a good read for me."
4,Fashionable Pendant Lights,"Delivered on time, and the unique look that matches basketmaker's kitchen decor. Competitor's weave design was discontinued. Like the flexibilty of this one, even though we assembled pretty much as shown. The spiral weave decoration is actually a separate piece with male thread on each end of a four inch insert. You get 2 six inch rods and 2 twelve inch rods with female threads on each end. So, the shortest length of a pendand is 16 inches. Since we wanted to hang 3 of pendants at 3 different lengths, this wasn't really as close to the ceiling as we hoped. So, I cut one end off of an unused rod and made a close nipple out of it. Worked well. Love them the way installed. If Dolan provided a single one inch ""rod"" connector it would have been the perfect pendant.The Georgian finish comes with amber glass globes that tone down the light and give a rich look, perfect for dining. Glad we decided not to go with the brushed metal finish."
5,"Sometimes, no solace","The book burns, numbs, burns. The people are real. The history is real. ""It was History she ran from,"" the author tells us, we who are prone to forget or deny, ""and, to her, there was no stalker more tenacious, no trapper so cunning: its favorite victims are those who survive."""
4,gift of the Nile,I liked this book because it gave factual information about how the Egyptians used the river. The main thing I enjoyed were the picutes and the wording used to describe the importance and center of Egypt the Nile was. It is a very good book and I believe that it is worth buying. I will use it in my own library at home.
3,"Partner Dancing the Country Way, Vol. 3","We ordered the first 2 in the series and began taking lessons at a local dance studio. Found out that the instructor was using these to polish up on her knowledge of the dances. Made it easy to go back to the house and practice. I NEVER danced before and found these quite helpful. My wife had taken dance etc throughout her kid years and found these helpful too. After a few lessons and viewing these tapes, I felt that I was ready to get out there. I review these on a regular basis esp before we go out. Thats the key; go out dancing!! We now have all 4 of the videos. The clothing is pretty outdated, the hairstyles are funny, but the dancing hasnt changed...."
2,This version is misleading -- No illustrations,"Sure, Treasure Island is a great story, but the question you *should* have is which version of this great book should you buy?I bought this version because I wanted illustrations for my 6YO daughter. I was expecting at least as many illustrations as the Illustrated Junior Library version. This version, even though it's ""Illustrated Children's Library"", is disappointingly sparsely illustrated.The book itself is nicely bound with a helpful bookmark. But be forewarned, do not buy this version if you want illustrations."
5,This is a great peppermill for cooking in the kitchen,"This mill, while not a ""table appointment"" is a fantastic pepper mill for the kitchen, which is likely its intended use."
2,"Just too big, no style","It is too big and looks ridiculous. I wasn't sure about how big a 20inch mill would look like on my big table. It is just bulky, big, non stylish, even ugly.If you are looking for a nice mill that looks stylish on your table don't go with this one. Go to 17 inch. That's enough. Really.I bought it and returned it. But you can make your own experience. If you have a Napoleon complex this is the one to get though. Or if you want to kill someone."
1,Morgenthau was our problem,"I live in Brazil and I like to read books.About twenty years ago, I found this old book.Then, I tried to read it.This book is so bad and ridiculous...A bad book is biased, absurd, bigoted?This book is 100% biased, absurd and bigoted.There wasn't any problem among Germany, when this bigoted book was writen.At that times, Morgenthau was linked to a Stalin's soviet spy called Dexter White.It seems to be possible that the soviet spy White really was the ""Ghost writer"" behind this trash-book."
4,A fantastic combination!,"Goldratt and Deming, are arguably two of the most influential business thinkers ever. This book melds statistical process control, and the Theory of Constraints, finally bringing these techniques together in one book. You'll gain a basic understanding of both SPC, and an intro to the Theory of Constraints (TOC), and Goldratts' Thinking Processes (TP). In addition to presenting the tools for process control, measurement, and continuous improvement, the book provides brief bios of both Deming and Goldratt, giving the reader insight into the background of both. Very good book, and a great compliment to other TOC material."
5,Eddir Bauer Designer 22 Infant Car Seat,This product has good eye appeal and very easy assembly of the hood. I find that the Eddie Bauer products have the most cushion for baby.
2,disappointed with seat latch,"I purchased this carrier with the double stroller as a matching set. It looks nice, the pattern is fine although I do not like design of the sunshade.But.... the latch button (red) where you ""click"" in the straps over your infant, is impossible to press in to unlatch. It also has a plastic puzzle lock. I do not understand why it has a puzzle lock and it is very cheaply made plastic.I returned the carrier because it is not usable with this lock."
5,"Caramel coated, cinnamon scented","Any time I see a CD title that alludes to heavenly origins, I'm immediately suspect. But that's not the case here. Every song on this CD is so delicate and ethereal that it's barely there...a beautiful whisper. An earlier reviewer said that ""Come From Heaven"" reminded him of ""a warm spring day in an endless field of grass with nowhere to go and nothing to do but exist."" That description was the clincher in my buying decision and this CD lived up to every word of it."
3,My Life Without Me,"There is a soundtrack to the movie, however it's an import. You can find is on Amazon.de (if you speak german LOL) and also you can get it on [...]. I keep seeing people get ripped off for copies of the soundtrack on ebay paying up to 50 bucks, I got mine from germanmusicexpress for like 25 bucks and it included shipping. Well worth it! Buy the soundtrack don't waste your money on buying all the individual cds!!!"
5,To Music Fan,"You're clearly and idiot. Although right about no soundtack to ""my life without me"", you are looking for the soundtrack to ""Mi Vida Sin Mi"" which can be found on this website."
5,awesome disc,"for those sweet and unrelentingly romantic times that i spent with my baybee, i would only put on one disc: comefromheaven by alpha.this is one of the best cds in my collection."
1,"""for all intents and purposes""","this phrase was on every other page. to the relative of the hack writer, ""mind numbing"" is right. luckily- library material."
4,great moments,"I've read the other reviews of Deuces Wild and agree that this is not a seminal blues album, but all the artists have done an outstanding job of working with BB and expanding on the classics presented here. I continue to thoroughly enjoy this album. Nicely configured and produced."
4,An interesting concept.,"On this CD, BB King brings in many of the people he influenced to remake many of his classics. As one reviewer mentioned, it really is not the true blues that many people have come to love from BB, but that is not all bad. Just look at this list of names he teams with: Eric Clapton, Tracy Chapman, Willie Nelson, The Rolling Stones, Bonnie Raitt. This is an impressive list and they do a good job with the King Of The Blues."
5,Great songs!! Great Crew!!,This is one great blues album with B.B. Singing at his finest! The choice of song were fantastic as well as the people he chose to join him! The surprise of the album was a rap number with Heavy D. This song is turning into my favorite one! the one complaint I have is that he plays guitar in parts where he shouldn't! What the hell...he's B.B King & he can do anything he damn well pleases!
2,very average,"i only like the tracks with Bonnie raitt,Dr.John&Willie Nelson.the problem with this disc is what was wrong with those lame Frank Sinatra discs no real chemistry.nowadays for what ever reason it's fashionable putting many acts on one disc as opposed to sinking or swimming unto your ownself.now B.B King needs no help he is a Legend and a musical Genius.but this is not a great tribute for the man.the cards on this deck aren't aces."
5,Love these glasses,I bought these because I needed an all-purpose glass inwhich to serve guests on various occassions and this fit the bill perfectly. The glasses arrived as expected (on-time and in mint condition).
3,Great for parties,"These are the wine glasses I use when I am having an outdoor party. They are sturdy enough to hold up to a little rough treatment, but still capacious enough to allow swirling and sniffing. They are SO much better than drinking wine out of a plastic cup and at this price you can always keep a set on hand."
5,Best goblets ever!!,"OMG I just LOVE LOVE LOVE these goblets! We tend to buy expensive wine glasses that always break, b/c the stem is too thin. We do not have that problem with these wine goblets! The quality is EXCELLENT, esp considering how little we payed for these. The stem is so thick and the overall design is very very nice. You will love them! These are definitely a big winner!!"
2,ugly and clumsy they do hold wine,These glasses do hold wine. They are ugly and clumsy. Too expensive to return so I gave them away to someone who needs them for the office pantry.
3,"Passport Lite - charming and smooth, but missing something....","So what really is Passport's sound? How can you pin down a group that has evolved so much over so many years? Nothing is really consistent except (on all the albums I've heard so far) superb musicianship.In the late 70s , I first heard Passport's Cross-Collateral, and I still think it's one of the best albums in my entire jazz collection. Cross-Collateral is my reference point.That said, I find this a very innocuous album akin to other jazz lite albums that could easily be forgotten. Cross-Collateral demands your attention; Alaxaria is great background reading music (except the last piece, which is patently annoying).3 stars for superb musicianship"
5,beautiful,"The fabric is not like I expected - its better! Its very similar to a tapestry, and very regal looking. There are many colors in the pattern, even navy which I don't think was mentioned in the description."
2,Amazon's desciption is totally inaccurate,"I received this item and it was NOT even close to their description.The comforter is nice but NO braided edging, the bedskirt is NOT a tweed woven stripe it was plain brown taupe chenille and the shams did NOT have edging on them either.Very disappointing....it looks like they threw together some leftover bedskirts.I have ordered many things from Amazon and this is the first time that it was not a great experience."
3,Great for the price..,My only complaint is that the King comforter is not big enough to fully cover the king matress with adiquate side coverage. Also the pillow shams have worn excessively for only being washed 4 times.
5,Great resource! I wish it had been available 20 years ago.,Nazaroff and Cohen-Alvarez: Where were you when I got interested in this field a long time ago? I used to buy several texts to cover the material ccvered in this great book. It combines information from various disciplines and provides a comprehensive resource that is invaluable. It covers the basics and takes the reader-user through to applications. It is obviously a valuable resource for engineering students and faculty as well as practitioners.
5,Best Yet!!,"I read this book while I was sitting in a bookstore, and I sat there for 2 hours. I thought that this book was one of the best yet and I can't wait to read the next one. But in the end of the book, one of the main characters dies, which was kind of disapointing. I totally don't agree with R, your friendly neighborhood reviewer who thinks this series is stupid and the books should be burned. But I love vampires and if you do then you'll love these books, too."
5,Better with each book,Darren and the folk almost end the series but the story takes a crazy turn to keep you reading. Couldn‘t put it down
5,"Mr. Crepsley, Finally didnt have the Luck of the Vampires on his side.","I was so Disappointed when Shan threw in that plot twist, that Mika didnt actually save Mr. Crepsley, I was incredulous!!!!!"
5,Killers of the Dawn,"This is the BEST Cirque Du Freak book I have read so far. It is full of awsome and exciting situations which will makes this the ultimate pageturner. If you are into this series this book is a ""must!"""
5,Joe Pass Intercontinental,This is one of the best jazz guitar records ever made. Joe Pass and his trio play at a consistently high musical level on all of the tunes and their performance was captured with a pristine quality by the European recording studio where it was made. Joe Pass is one of the few zen masters of the instrument and this recording is an essential addition to the collections of both players and listeners of jazz guitar.
1,Potential that goes nowhere,"The plot begins with what I viewed to be a good idea so I read on in good faith. But the thought provoking plot about life and death doesn't lead to anything.All I found was a plot that built and built, but in the end there was nothing gained or truly learned. There is zero character developement and they were all flat to begin with, though each looked promising at the outset.The book is to say the most, disappointing. What looks to be a good story turns out rather flat, however intriguing its message, there is no real story to convey that message."
1,What is the Point?,"Never have I wrote a review, but this time I just had to. This book was so disappointing.I kept waiting for the author to start the story. Perhaps I am old fashioned that way, I want a plot. Many issues and concepts were hinted at but it all came to a crashing end with no real closure. Wilson was developing great characters but he kept killing them off before you got to know them. This story of earth science against alien nature is interesting, but it is more just a short story instead of a novel. Actually, it reads like the introduction to one of those space operas (which I happen to like reading now and then, so it isn't a bad thing.)Then just when something could really start to happen, the book ends."
3,So?,"Yeah, RCW puts forth a good hypothesis about life, consciuousness and communication. But, when I finished the last page and put the book down, I said ""So?"".The book really didn't leave me with anything to think about.The characters were shallow (probably have to be in a book this thin). I never really got to know anyone, even the protagonist.A short book. An easy read. Read it if you're into RCW's books, or if you want a short, planetary exploration diversion. But don't expect too much."
4,Bios - Wilson Lite,"Toronto author Robert Charles Wilson has built up a bit of a reputation for being the most unknown good SF author out there. After a hiatus in the mid 90's he came back with the interesting ""Darwinia"".His next book was Bios. This is a much more traditional adventure novel and doesn't really include any of the hard science elements that are to be found in Darwinia. Yet it also isn't quite as character driven as his earlier books (e.g. Mysterium and Gypsies). The fact that it has 28 chapters in 200 pages, means that this is really little more than an extended novella.All in all this is a minor book for Wison, but it is still an excellent SF novel (if short!)"
2,Mildly interesting but shallow,"The story is interesting, albeit far from being original. Characters are weak and unconvincing, and the background story is filled with boring cliches borrowed from distopian fantasies already written and forgotten thousands of times long time ago. The main plot is underdeveloped, although a better author may have found better ways to make it interesting."
2,"Good hard sci-fi, but read only if you enjoy fatalism","This novel made me feel mad, claustrophobic and creepy.I'm trying to drub the thoughts in this novel out of mybrain somehow and soon.Don't read futher if you don't want to know the ending.A compeling read of good hard science fiction at first.But the hero and heroine struggle at their quest butthey are hopelessly inadequate technologically.Just as you start to care about them the author killsthem separately with out anyone knowing their fate.Then in the epilogue the author tries to make things upbeatwhen a new crew retrace the original crews path to thenew planet. This new crew is sucessful and can sense theessence of the old crew in the wind.What the crap kind of ending is this?Scientifically speaking how does that work? Mystical soundwaves? Good grief that's not hard scifi and is notscientific."
1,If this is good . . . . then I am confused,"I could not get through Darwinia. And Bios, when it was all said and done, had no purpose. The text of both books are repetitive. If you looking for human interaction, neither of these books offer much. There is only a limited amount of dialog. If you are looking for new ways of thinking about science, its not here. But both books offer enviornmental detail ad nuasea, with no real contribution to the plot. Neither book offered me any new insights. The plot and character development in Bios could have been covered in 50 pages. Both Darwinina and Bios were a waste of my time and money."
5,Xclear,I love this spray. It works well. It was recommended by my daughter's Pediatrician. He has been using for his own children as well. Every time my daughter starts having sinus symptoms we start using this spray.
1,Not as good as the original,"The original product with the long neck is much better. I get this weird sweaty smell between the cap and nozzle, and it actually starts growing this black stuff on the nozzle (really hoping its not black mold). Love the original, but not a fan of these"
3,It kinda works.,"This spray doesn't work as good as Afrin but it also not bad it is also not bad for you like Afrin is. It is worth giving a try--especially for a dry, stuffy nose."
5,Great Product,"My husband was given this by a doctor at an urgent care office when he got a sinus infection a couple of years ago. He suffers from terrible allergies and always has issues regardless of if he is sick or not. He loves this stuff and has been very happy with it! I've also noticed that when he uses it on a more regular basis, it definitely helps with his snoring."
3,Doesn't live up to the claims.,I read up on this product before I purchased it. I was hoping to alleviate some allergies and asthma. I used the product for a month with no results.
5,Relief,"Having suffered for years from sinusits, this product of a God send! It is quick, easy, and long lasting. Coughing as badly as when I was smoking is completely eliminated. Thank the Lord for small favors."
1,Stung and may have caused infection,"Xlear Saline Nasal Wash stung a bit, but not unbearably, so I kept using it. After a week, I got a terrible sinus infection. I don't know if it was a reaction to the Xlear or just coincidence, but since the Xclear was unpleasant anyway, I stopped using it. I went back to my tried and true allergy relief: salt water and a neti pot."
2,"Jeff Scott Soto ruins everything... great music, though","Can't stand Soto yelling and ruining the beauty of the ballads here... Fortunately, now Axel counts on the excellent Johnny Gioeli on vocals."
5,THE BEST 5th OUT THERE --- DO NOT MISS IT,This is simply the best Shostakovich 5th out there....I have heard lots of recordings but this one has something very very special...It has the dusky hues the score requires...The playing and feeling are perfect...One of my desert island discs....Do not pass it up!
3,Yet Another Compilation,"I wasn't aware of this 1996 release until I saw it in my sister's collection. Seems odd that this came out only one year before ""Should God Forget"" their double cd retrospective. Of course, since they broke up in 1991 there have been numerous compilations. Yes, all of these songs are good, the three stars are here because none of these tunes appeared on the ""All Of This And Nothing"" comp. Anyone hearing this cd would probably want to buy all five of the cd's this collection collects. Most of these individual albums would earn four or five stars by most music lovers. If you're not familiar with the band, they are similar to Roxy Music and Toad the Wet Sprocket. Cuts 5, 6 & 7 are from the first album simply entitled ""Psychedelic Furs"" (1980); cuts 3 & 4 are from Talk Talk Talk (1981); cut 9 is from ""Forever Now"" (1982); cuts 8 & 10 are from ""Mirror Moves"" (1984); and cuts 1 & 2 are from ""Midnight to Midnight"" (1986). These are all highly listenable albums."
3,Ghost Plane,"Most of this is a chapter by chapter case by case analysis of various individuals alleged to have ties to terrorist groups who were snatched up by the CIA, taken to countries where there are no laws against torturing people and basicly tortured by outsourcing. As if this wasn't bad enough the ties any of these people had to terrorism were very dubious at best. I have to commend Greys investigative journalism in putting this book together. The book itself wasn't overly exciting or interesting to read for me but thats probably because I was already familiar with most of the subject matter covered in this book. Still its a worthwhile read."
4,Long lost Mike Hamilton,"Mike Hamilton has continued his genius, playing his music on his terms for years at the Cedar Creek restaurant in Laguna Beach, California. He does a stunning rendition of Hendrick's 'Red House' on request. Guitar junkies file in and sit amongst romantic couples to listen and learn."
5,Indian Pipes Review,"Excellent summer read for the beach or hammock. Characters are lively and believable, and keeps you wondering who the murderer was till the very end of the story."
3,Good but sometimes skipping ahead too fast,"This book gives a detailed description of the use of an advanced method to deal with nested data sets.At a general level the constructs and ideas are well written and can be followed reasonably easily.However the mathematics is often written very dense, which makes reading and understanding complex.My main problem with the book, is that in many of the examples they provide, the given formula's, and data skip rapidly to the solution. Thus it is often not insightfull at all, how the data led to the numerical outcome (and I and several of my colleagues could not reproduce all of the example outcomes). A more extensive discussion and a more step-by-step construction of the examples would have been helpful there.So in short: Conceptually this book is fine, but for practical use mathematics are too dense, and examples are too hard to follow"
5,Excellent card!,"I don't know where the guy below got that this card doesn't work with Windows Media Center Edition because I just installed the latest XP drivers for the card on Media Center Edition 2005 and it works perfectly. I sold my GIGAPort AG to get this because of the much better signal/noise ratio that the FireWire Audiophile has and it made a big difference. Very clean sound! I use it to DJ with using MixVibes, using the ASIO drivers and it works beautifully! A great buy to say the least... pick one up, you wont regret it!"
3,"Good, but not stellar","I needed a replacement audio interface so I could continue to use my M-Powered ProTools when I changed computers. This one is will do. The control panel is non-intuitive and only sporadically shows up in my dock. All the warnings about power-on order and not hot-plugging the device somewhat scared me, frankly. But it has been a reliable performer."
4,Great listening,Wonderful selection of music. Nice to sit by the fireplace listening to the soft sounds!
5,Light and durable safety shoe,"Great shoe! I work in the engine room on commercial ships, and spend my 12-hour working days running up and down ladders (stairs). The lightweight construction of these is just wonderful, my legs have never been happier at the end of the day; and the safety toe and slip resistant sole keep me safe about my work. I am ordering my third pair today, which might suggest that they wear out quickly, but if you only knew the punishment I subject them to you would understand. My company buys me a pair once a year so I keep getting these. Just don't expect to win any style awards. Best lightweight safety shoe I've found in 30 years of going to sea. Also nice because I can slip into and out of them quickly, so when the engineer alarm goes off at oh-dark-thirty I can jump out of my bunk and be dressed and shod in a flash. Awesome shoe."
2,Nautilus shoe,"The first pair (too small) were beautiful shoes. They didn't look like seconds. the next pair, the toes didn't match, they were much larger than expected, all around we were really disappointed."
5,norm and action,"An incredible investigation on normative logic and maybe one of the firts authors to explore and deeply analyse the finalistic norms structure, as nowadays seem to be the fundamental rights."
3,Shows styles but doesn't teach you to play.,"Pete Seeger has been around for awhile, and is interesting to watch. The title of this video is kind of misleading. It doesn't teach you to play the banjo, it shows you the different ways to play the banjo. If you're looking for an instructional video this isn't it."
2,TAPE WAS NOT THAT BAD BACK THEN!,"I read the reviews but ordered it anyway. They were mostly right on. I havent watched all the discs yet, but, the first one was horrible. I couldnt make out the players from the distance shot. Up close was ok, but, I remember these games, and tapes are only from 35 yrs ago. They show highlights from games in the 40's or 50's that are clear, so what gives with this?That being said, I am an avid fan, and havent seen these games since I was 12 yrs old. So, it was fun to watch again. I would say you must be a diehard fan to watch these DVD's, and thats a shame."
3,Super Bowls IX and X: Very Disappointing Quality,"I can't believe that Warner and the NFL couldn't provide better quality recordings for Superbowls IX and X. The quality is absolutely HORRIBLE!!! I'm giving this three stars only because Super Bowls XIII and XIV are much better but not as good as they should be. Also, Super Bowl XL is better on this set than the one included in ""The Steelers Road To Super Bowl XL"" box because you get the Al Michaels - John Madden audio instead of the radio broadcast. But other than that, I feel very cheated!!! Warner and the NFL should be ashamed. The fans deserve better than this."
4,better than I expected....,"Okay, here's the deal. If you've read the reviews, you've seen that several people have issues with the quality of the video. Some people have said that SB IX and X are so bad, they can't be watched. I disagree. The quality is poor at best, but if you're a true Steeler fan who wants to relive these Super Bowl memories, then I would recommend this video series. But understand the quality is POOR for SB IX and X. I would relate it to watching a VHS tape that has been copied a couple of times. We thought SB X was actually a little worse that IX. The quality of Super Bowl XIII and XIV is actually pretty good, and of course SB XL is perfect. I put off buying this DVD set because of the bad reviews, and then decided to go ahead and buy it knowing that the first two might not be watchable. Knowing that in advance made it acceptable for me. The bottom line is I'm glad I bought it."
2,Where did they get the source for these games,Like a previous review indicated - the quality of these games are below standard - there has to be better quality footage in the network vaults - these look like they were copied from a bootlegged VHS tape instead of the network source tape -- having said that -- it's still a great piece of history
1,"Supers 9 and 10 are poor quality, will disappoint all buyers","I received my copy and attempted to watch super bowl 9 and then 10. The video was so poor on a 1080P top of the line plasma I wrote to customer service at Warner Brothers and was told that it was not a flaw, that was the best video that could produce.I had purchased Super Bowl 10 on Ebay and it was at least clear enough to watch. The 9 and 10 games are worse than any video I have ever purchased. I find it hard to believe there is not a better copy available to the NFL.I would not recommend this set for anyone.Super Bowls 13 and 14 are a bit better quality and of course Super bowl 40 is perfect."
2,Disappointed,Super Bowl IX and X are NOT watchable. They look like VHS tapes that have been copied from previous copies several times. Very disappointed. Super Bowl XIII and XIV are pretty good.
2,Not for HDTV,They really did a poor job of putting this set together. I bought it for my dad and it was nice to see the old games but the video quality was really a let down.
3,Not what I expected,I bought this product to use with my boat and because the features made me believe it had all the lakes. After opening the box I discovered the lakes where I live are not included! I called the customer service and was told I needed to download the lake portion for $150.00. NO THANK YOU!Garmin GPSMap 76 Handheld GPS Navigator
5,Perfect,"Loved it right out of the box. Well thought out, user freindly. Used it for geocaching and it took me within 6'. I could see other peoples tracks in the snow that missed the geocach and never found it. Very little bounce on most trips. Easy to download from the computer, I would recomend this one to anyone unsure about how to get started. This one is easy and true."
4,Garmin GPS Map 76,The 76 is what I thought it would be. Easy to learn how to use. Connects with my laptop for marine charts.Would buy again
4,Garmin GPSMap 76,"The GPSMap76 is a great unit! More functions than I'll ever be able to figure out how to use. Contrary to the what the writeup says, the unit does fit into my shirtpocket. So far, only two shortcomings. 1) Not rechargeable (2-AA batteries) and 2) the manual seems sparse on details of ""how to"". All-in-all 4 stars. A REALLY GOOD UNIT!!"
4,Great product,"My husband and father both have this unit. It's really handy to have on road trips and to use while Geocaching. From our experience, it does take a while to download map information onto the unit, and a color screen would be nice, but for $200, I think it's a good value."
3,"Nice screen and maps, but missing a few features","The maps are nice, but the user interface is lacking. We travel all over Michigan and visit many lakes and this unit works great after loading the necessary maps, to see where you are. The only problem is when we are looking for a set of GPS coordintes, it is nice to see the compass and the coordinates on the same screen, like the older garmin 12 was able to do. With this unit you cannot get both on the same screen. The compass is on one screen, and you position is on another. If you are looking for an exact spot, it is nice to see your coordintes change and the N S E W heading as you are moving, otherwise you have to guess which way is up, so to speak, especially when you are in a boat moving around quite a bit."
4,Great GPS for the price,"I am an avid snowmobiler and needed a GPS to help navigate the wooded trails in the winter. Ilookaed at alot of GPS's and thisone was the best fit for me. it has 8MB storage, Lasts a long time on one set of alkaline AA's, and is made by a reputable company. I bought a carrying case with it and plan on buying a RAM Mount to mount it on my 1999 Skidoo MXZ 600."
5,Review of GPSMAP 76,"The product was used and still had some way points in it, which I deleted. It was in like new condition and worked perfectly. All literature and cables appeared to never have been used. I did email the vendor with a question about software for this product and received a prompt response."
5,Excellent product - Many useful features,Excellent quality / price relation. It has many useful features. Easy to use. The pc cable provided works great ( even with linux - gpsman software - ).
2,"Not Mac compatible, hard to create waypoints","I haven't seen this written explicitly, anywhere, so here goes: This thing isn't mac compatible. Using a serial to USB converter, and some free software (Garmin software will be no help) you can get to the gps data on windows, but good luck if you're on a mac.Also, it is really hard to create new waypoints on the water. This is because if you try and create a waypoint too close to a known feature (such as a highway, intersection, or BODY OF WATER), the GPS will try and use the center of the feature (or something like that). So, to create waypoints over water, your only solution is to manually enter the lat and long (you can't use the cursor to select a point)."
4,Spacious,My daughter is 8 months and is about 17lbs this high chair is roomy. I strap her in and there is plenty of room to spare she likes to kick her feet up on the bar the separates her legs she loves it. Its not big and bulky and it comes assembled which is always a plus if your husband is not the fix it guy. I am glad I bought this high chair but it could be cheaper!I guess you pay for the fact that its ready to go out of the box. It keeps my daughter safe and will last until she is three thats great.
5,Great Collapsible High Chair,"We really love this high chair. We have a small kitchen and it folds up nicely to slip between our refrigerator and cabinet. Only three minor annoyances. First, the locks on the front wheels lock themselves randomly. I could be rolling it across the floor and one or both will lock. Second minor annoyance is that the attached small tray is just that: attached. It does not come off, which at times makes getting my kiddo into the seat a bit difficult. Finally, to collapse the same tray is somewhat tedious. We felt that despite these things, we would definitely buy this chair again. Great quality and value."
2,"Roomy, but gets gross & dirty","We have a BIG toddler, and I truly commend the spaciousness of this model...BUT...Here are the reasons why I am now looking for a new highchair:1) The chair pad is SO hard to clean...it's not your average toss-in-the-washer pad. So....you can try to constantly spot-clean, but it gets dirtier, and dirtier, and dirtier. Then the flies start eyeballing your highchair.2) When you place the positioning of the seat lower, and your little one is a bit hyper (or perhaps still has a wobbly head), they will hit their head on the large, round side-hinge thingies. (This is my scientific name for them.)Seriously, I don't think our highchair could get much more gross. But before it does, I'm getting a new one. Perhaps the Fisher Price ""Zen Highchair."""
4,Love it,"We love this high chair. It suits our needs perfectly. It is incredibly slim and easy to set up. There are only two down sides; The little tray does not come off and the height is not adjustable. Still, I'd highly recommend it!"
3,not satisfied,Chair was to small for our 7 month old and did not go to the height that we were expecting. Price was good but you get what you pay for.
4,Highchair Review,"The design of this highchair is wonderful. It is not cutesy and fits into the decor of our house. I love the different height options and it is comfy for our lil man to sit in.I like having the extra tray on top, so in case of a spill or huge mess, you can just remove it and keep feeding! I do wish that there weren't so many crevices for food to get into, but it is a highchair and is easy to clean for the purpose it serves.I would recommend this highchair to anyone.Graco Contempo Highchair, Rittenhouse"
3,It's OK,"I bought this highchair because of the high review marks that it received. It is OK. It's wider than most highchairs and a little bulky (my husband always trips over the highchair legs). I went to babies r us after I received this purchase and wish I bought another one. The tray is also very big. There is another tray that snaps on to the regular tray, so that you essentially have 2 trays you can use. The regular tray is very large and doesn't fit in a standard dishwasher. Plus, the harness is also really strange and none that i've seen before."
1,THE Absolutely WORST and UNSAFE highchair EVER!,"This chair (unsafe design!) doesn't deserve any star at all!At first it wasn't bad. As my baby get older, however, she was easily able to unbuckle the so called 5 point harness. The slightest pressure can get the button undone.Long story short, my baby fell out of this awful thing and we ended up with broken collar bone. Absolute nightmare! Absolutely the worst piece of crap ever. (I normally don't use this kind of language) Save your time and money and stay away, by all means, from this very very very poor product."
3,Not that great,"I purchased this for my 6 month old because I think Graco is a quality brand and I really liked the folding feature. My son is a big baby and the bottom part of the seat is not long enough. I planned for him to be in this until he was ready to sit at the table, but he'll outgrow it within 6 months. I also don't like the attached tray. I don't see the point of it. This is my 4th child, so my 4th highchair and I'm just not impressed with it."
3,Clean up is a total pain!!!,"I am very frustrated with this product. It looks great and has nice features but is a COMPLETE PAIN to clean. It takes me twice as long to clean up than to feed my son...and almost all of this time is cleaning up the high chair. The plastic has too many crevices that trap food...most of which don't seem to serve a purpose; the safety harness straps are textured and this also traps food as do the buckle and size adjustment brackets on the straps; finally, the metal and plastic stand has a number of areas where food gets lodged. The fabric seat you can wipe clean, but you have to take a damp sponge to it every time and then plan on washing it every week or so. I get so irritated every day that I use this product and wish that I had never bought it. It's as if GRACO never tested this product - unbelievable!!"
4,Good Highchair,"We've used this highchair daily for the last two months and have been happy with it. The fabric seat comes off for easy washing but as another reviewer mentioned, the straps do not. Babies get messy and mine likes to pull on those straps with food still on his hands which gets into the crannies of that those straps. It takes a little bit of an effort to wipe it out which could have been avoided if the design allowed for it to be taken out for washing. We have the Rittenhouse print and the black portion of it (around the top area) tends to catch lint very easily. I have something of an OCD with lint on clothing and I wish Graco had a better choice for a lint free fabric than this. These are all very minor issues and overall I am happy with the functioning of the high chair. It folds up into a nice compact size for storage and the different height levels and reclining features are very useful. A good buy."
3,Beautiful but not practical,"There are a lot of things I love about this highchair. It's gorgeous, I can set it up or tear it down in about 30 seconds, and the trays are great. However, the straps are not removable. And I have 1 year old triplets who make a huge mess at mealtime and chew on the straps. They get FILTHY. And then I have one who had reflux and pukes at the slightest provocation (choking on finger foods, etc.). So I'm constantly cleaning up vomit (not spit up, throw up). And because the straps aren't removable, I have to hand scrub the braided straps. It is extremely difficult to get everything out of the nooks and crannies, and the puke smell really never goes away. If I could toss them in the washing machine (like you can with Fisher Price products), it would be so much better. In the end, for me, I wish I had gone with Fisher Price. Maybe not as pretty, but definitely more practical."
4,Good quality highchair.,"This is a very functional highchair that has worked really well so far for my daughter. We visit my husband's grandparents regularly, and bringing this highchair along with us is so easy because of how small it becomes when folded.My only complaint is the fabric sides of the seat are floppy, and kind of hang in my daughter's lap when she sits in it. That doesn't seem to keep any stray food from escaping, but baby's are a messy business and I don't think any highchair can even remotely contain mess. The fact that it's so easy to clean pretty much negates this issue.My husband doesn't like that the tray rips his arm hair clean off when the insert is in place, but he simply takes it off if he's going to be the one to feed our daughter. The tray itself is easy to clean by hand."
5,Great Highchair!,This is a great highchair. I bought it because my friends had it and liked it so much. It folds for easy transport. It is made well and very easy to clean. It works great for my six month old.
3,Graco can do better,"Received the High chair as a replacement for a recalled high chair. It is great that it fold so slim and can be put out of the way easily. But negatives out weigh the positives. It is difficult to get clean. The seat cover shows all the dirt and is machine washable, but it would be nice if I could wipe it down and not have to wash it weekly. The tray insert is useless as it only covers the front and not the corners, so if you use the insert you still have to clean the tray! Also the ""Flowers"" that are in the corners of the try get food stuck in them and are pointless. I have yet to see or hear of anything that attaches there? Good High chair if your limited on space and need to store it easily, but terrible if you like easy clean-up!"
1,Worst Product,Impossible to clean. DOES NOT COME WITH SECOND COVER. You cant remove the straps to clean them so they become filthy. Adjusting the straps to higher on the shoulders is impossible because you cant get into that part of the chair. This is a horrible highchair. Dont be fooled by the cute fabric.
1,horrible purchase I have ever made,"I purchased this item through Amazon after reading the reviews. The product doesn't stand up to it's reviews. The seat cover fell apart after the first hand wash. When I called the customer service the DOTS design that I have paid extra for is unavailable. The alternative that I have ordered, which they have claimed is readily available is not shipped to me for 2 months. There is no follow up. When I called them a month later I was told that even the alternative is on back order, but it will be shipped to me in 3-4 days. Another month, a phone call and after changing to another design I finally got the replacement. Ofcourse the replacement cover doesn't match the chair now."
2,pretty but comfy or sturdy,"This is a very good, modern, chabby chic-ish looking high chair but it has a tiny seat and is very wobbly. I returned it immediately so I don't know if it can weather the baby-storm."
1,"Cannot get the paper display off the tray, HELP!","I have not tested the high chair het, because I cannot get the glue off the tray.This ridiculous glue was used to stick a paper display on the larger tray. I havesoaked it,,,scrubbed it and still the glue remains on it. What can I do? I will notuse chemicals."
2,Does not have leatherette/wipeable cover,I just got this in the mail and have to return it because it does not have the leatherette cover. Who has time to machine wash the cover after every feeding!?
1,Tray Label,"actually - the chair seems fine so far...I just wanted to complain about the stupid label on the removable tray. Obviously the Graco design staff wanted a label that's easy to remove ""peel off"", but for some reason Graco used a cheap label and adhesive that tore off in tiny little strips. I mean I haven't even used this product yet, and I've already spent 10 minutes dealing with the problem of taking off a label.Seriously? spend the extra penny and use a better label!"
3,Sturdy,"I really like this high chair. THe only issue I have is that its a bit bulky and when it's folded, you cannot open it one handed (if you have baby in your arms, you have to set him or her down to open). Other than that I reccomend it!"
3,Decent but not great,"I purchased this highchair because I liked the idea of the extra tray that pulls off to clean and it's slim fold design. The tray is great and very convienient to clean! It turns out I never fold it since it's used so frequently. The issue that I have with it and why I gave it three stars is that my daughter leans to the side and gets her elbow/arm stuck in between the legs and the seat. She starts screaming and I have to manuever her arm to free her. I thought she would grow out of it but we purchased it when she was six months, she is now eleven months, and it still happens...although not as frequently."
5,Awesome Highchair!!,I bought this highchair because my Costco folding highchair tray didn't slide close enough to my baby. I absolutely love this high chair. I have a space issue in my house so I am able to fold it up and store it when I am done. I also love the different reclines and heights the seat allows!
5,Really satisfied with this highchair,"We bought this for our daughter when she was 5 months old. She is 9 months now and we have no complaints. The chair can easily fold, although we almost never do. We bought this particular chair because of the reviews and we liked the design (Dots) in the photos. We were not disappointed when we got the chair. It looks just as good as the photos, the chair holds our baby in securely, the tray slides in easily and locks securely in place, but also is easy to detach when you want it to."
5,"Great, comfy chair, cute print",My baby loves his highchair. He's very comfy in it-- he's able to sit in it for at least a half hour for our family dinners. I love that it has wheels on it so I can feed him at our table or at the counter.
5,wow it ia great,love extra tray works great in dishwasher.fits all age of our kids. 1/3/5 yrseasy to moveeasy to collapse and store.i will be buying another
5,LOVE IT! Would buy again and again!,"I LOVE THIS. Easy to clean, stain resistant, easy to fold/unfold, easy to use and it looks great! I hate baby patterned items so I instantly fell in love with the print on the fabric. When my child is messy i simply throw the tray in the dishwasher and the seat cover in the washing machine and it comes out just like new."
2,Disappointed,Was very disappointed by this highchair. The underside of the tray is rough and abraded my son's legs. The cloth cover gets very dirty in process of a baby eating and requires daily washings. Same with the straps. Returned ours and got the portable Fisher Price and have been much happier.
4,Love this highchair,"The highchair comes so easy to assemble. Just pulled it out of the box and it was ready. My daughter is 3 months old and I can recline it back so she can sit in it at the table with us. It is big enough that she will be able to use it a long time. The cushion is really soft but I gave it 4 stars because the cushion material is not plastic, it's more of a cloth...which I think will be hard to clean after those messy spaghetti dinners. We will see though. Other than that, it's a great looking chair and she seems to really like it."
2,Not quite there!,The highchair does it's basic function; the issue is with the footrest which does not tilt with the back incline and the castors on the legs are a pathetic excuse for being so as they don't function while locked!
2,No foot stool,"This highchair has everything...but a foot stool! How can Graco forget such an important part like this? Our kid does not like his feet hanging in the air. He has resorted to kicking his feet out and grabbing on to the edge of the table bottom part with his toes because there is no foot stool. This is an utter failure on design and I may consider purchasing another highchair that actually has a foot stool. BTW, that picture may look like there is a footstool but, there really is not."
5,contempo high chair,i bought this for my second child and loved it. I love how it folds easy and small enough to store easily when not in use for a while. I have a home daycare and have also used this chair for multiple children for about 3 years now and it still looks and functions great. highly recommended
3,Some nice and not so nice features,"Let me start with the positives:-has wheels which is great for moving baby around with me in the whole house!!!-nice, big tray with extra tray on top for simple cleaning-adjustable heights is nice for someone like me who is short & wants to feed baby sitting down-price is goodNow the negatives:-fabric doesn't breathe. I realize it has to be vinyl for cleaning purposes but my baby sweats in the chair & gets uncomfortable-the crotch strap stinks! It allows baby to move left & right of it so sometimes my son slides down (well, actually, he always slides down)"
4,nice highchair - cool colors,"I do like this highchair, mostly because it is stylish. The colors are much better in person than on the pictures. Very nice. Our 5 month old baby fits nicely into it with plently of room to grow.cons: the footrest is way too low and not adjustable. the tray doesn't feel as secure as I thought it would. It does roll, but not very well.overall I am happy with this chair for the price."
5,Love it!,"Wonderful! Easy to clean, can do everything with one hand while I hold my baby. Folds up small although it takes many steps to fold it up all the way."
5,"Adorable, Affordable, Stylish","I received this for my baby shower and I love the whole collection. The whole Rittenhouse collection I fell in love with when I first saw it. No matter if you are having a boy or girl, it is a classic color scheme and pattern and will go great in anyones house. It's modern, and the fabric is great. Highly recommend this Graco product!"
4,Great chair!,"Love everything about this high chair except for the ""snack"" tray that is always on high chair and that the top tray doesn't clip off without lifting it up towards the child's face (causing whatever food is on the tray to slide off). Other than that, it's super compact, easy to use, and looks better in person."
1,This book is terrible.,"Bought this book with high hopes after reading Dressler's Criminal and Sprankling's Property Law books from the same series, both of which are indispensable. In preparation for my ConLaw exam the first thing I tried to do was look up Rational Basis Review. The topic is not listed in either the index OR the table of contents. For that matter I can't find ANY level of scrutiny mentioned in either of those places. Perhaps the authors intended you to read this book from cover to cover, but unless that's your plan this book is useless."
3,Page Number Issue,Biggest problem is the inability to determine page numbers. Hard to do required readings without page references. Not sure why they did not include but has made the course much more difficult. Recommend one gets hard copy
4,AAA,this comic book is awesome it tells a little something about whitesnake and how they are created you will love it if you are a fan of course its a little incomplete
5,If you love fly fishing,This is a nice magazine with skills and great photos. Nice for beginners or experienced. Good product reviews. and travel ideas.
4,Good but can be better,"I have had it for 6 months now. I bought it to replace my A70, which took a beating during my 3 months vacation.Pro:Wide angle rules. Fast startup and shut down. Good quality in/our-door. AF assist light helps during poor light condition. Good battery. Panoramic/photo stitching is cool. Good software bundle. Good quality and reliable (from my prior experience).Con:No image stablization. Which would be very helpful at night shoots w/o tripod, max zoom, or any other conditions. Can not force flash at the ""AUTO"" mode.That's about it."
4,Good camera,"I was looking for a digital camera that has many features as SLR does, yet want it small enough that it's convinient for me to carry it anywhere to do a lot of photographs. I got S60 and so far I'm satisfied with it.The camera produced sharp images and good color balance. And the camera gets ready fast enough to shoot after we turn it on.Though I took many pictures with it and reviewed the images many times, I found out that the battery is long-lasting.I also like the software that puts the picture in folders titled by the date automatically. So I can choose not to print date on the pictures.However, sometimes it's quite hard to slide open your camera when your hand is sweaty. And also almost every single time I take the camera out of my pocket, I slide open the battery door. Yet, they are not a big deal to me."
4,Great camera,"It is quite a bit bigger than the s400 I used earlier. But the wide angle lens, extra zoom and manual controls make it worth the extra size. Slight barrel distortion is visible in some photographs. The flash is quite powerful. Quick, reliable delivery and competetive price from amazon.com."
4,SMALL RESERVATIONS,"This was my first digital camera and was selected primarily for it's wide angle lens which I find more usefull. The lens quality could be better, but seems to be available only in a more expensive SLR. No manual included with the ARCSOFT PHOTO STUDIO software. You can download this free from the web site (http://www.arcsoft.com/support/downloads)."
1,I DIDN'T RECIVED ALL THE ITEMS,"I have recived todya my camera S60 CANON POWER, I havent use it already but, when I made my buying order, it says ""Free memory with purchase"" but I havent receive it.I buyed the camera on octubre 5, where AMAZON says in ""recommendated for you"" that the camera s6o came with a Memory card of 256 Mb, but I havent received.I have chech my order (103-3082162-22003868 today and is still says ""free memory wuith purchaase"".Its horrible to feel you have been stolen."
5,lawn and garden,"I got these because the 18 inch tall fencing I bought was too short to keep my young Boxer out of my plants in the back yard. Plants, trees, shrubs, none were safe from her ;-). I did think she was jumping over it to get to the wall that backs up to the park where all the kids play. I ordered more to double fence that one area at a couple feet apart or so. She is a digger also and I need certain areas fenced in until she grows up more. Good product."
3,A Good Companion to the Video,"This book is a good companion to the excellent video of the same name as it covers in greater detail the ""theory"" behind many of these characteristically Chinese throws. As a stand-along product, however, the book is only fair: it is marred mainly by very poor picture quality."
3,Serves the purpose.,"Needed to add/change column headings, to include 1-total mpg, et 1-total cost of gasoline purchased. Also under Service Station Column, needed to include Brand and City/State."
4,Auto Record Book,Not exactly what I expected but very similar to older books of the same type. It is a very good book to keep your auto records in but I believe it is a little pricey.
5,Jennifer,This is a complete auto record book we have used for many years. We use it to track all fills and maintenance. If you like to keep a detailed record on your car this is the one.
5,Auto Record Book,"If you are a gearhead like me, you are looking for a way to capture all maintenance aspects of your vehicles. This book is what you are looking for. I routinely maintain five vehicles and at time it's easy to loose track of what services are due and when you performed previous maintenance. I highly recommend this style record book for anyone that wants to keep their vehicles maintained. You can even record every fuel stop, cost, mileage, MPG and location."
3,Not really made for the obsessive maintainer,"I've always meant to start a maintenance log for all my cars. Then months and years go by and I end up with a folder of random receipts. Thought I would start fresh with my new van.This book will work for me, but most of the pages are for mileage logs. Great if you deduct your business miles, not so great for me.There are a few pages for ""lube"" and a few pages for ""repairs"" with little room to detail the repair.Probably won't buy another one - a simple notepad would have sufficed."
3,Check carefully before using,"Cover was damaged in manufacturing process - upper right corner was chopped off. Returned for replacement with no problems, cover on replacement was fine."
3,Great Log Book but.....,"Love the size and quality of the book but my only big complaint is that it should have twice as many pages for logging fuel usage (and mentioned by other reviews). Most of the other pages in the book I won't use and would trade them for fuel log pages. After all, most of us will have many many more fuel entires than oil changes or new tires or repairs. I'm betting the At A Glance folks did this to make use purchase more log books"
4,AT A GLANCE Auto Record,"Very Nice Wire Bound Product To Keep Track Of All Your Auto Expenses.Fits In Glove Box. Has Pages for Gas & Oil Expenses, Tire Expenses,Trip Diary, Phone Numbers & Address, Memo Section. Best Product IHave Found To Date To Keep Track Of Auto Expenses."
4,At-A-Glance Auto Record,"Hard to find record book. Good for keeping quick reference to auto records. Space wasted in the memo section, could be much shorter and the space added to the fuel section."
5,Auto Record Book,"I like the organization of this book and the ease of use.I have used this book in the past to keep my auto records,they are good for about 120k miles before you need a new one. Buy one when you buy your car new and keep good records for your CPA"
5,Well worth it,I bought this mp3 player after searching the net for hours. I weighed the pros (small/not too expensive) vs the cons (only 32 mb memory non-expandable. Fortunatly for me the pros won out. The yepp is smaller than a pager and just as light as one. Although the memory is only 32 I managed to record just over an hour on it at the lowest compression setting (64kbps). If you are looking for something to go jogging or work out with this is the one.
2,not enough memory,"32 megs barely does 30 minutes of music and the software is clunky, clunky, clunky. Needs a more intuitive interface...let's I want to put tracks on my portable...why should that be so hard?"
4,Terrific for the Price,"For the price, this is a great little unit with good sound. It was easy to setup the software and using the USB Port downloading files was a snap. If your looking for a basic portable MP3 player, you can't go wrong with this unit. The unit is very small and lightweight which makes it perfect for jogging. The only drawback I see is that you're stuck with the 32 Mbyte of memory which let's you store approximately 30 mins of music."
3,fine for six songs,"the samsung has attractive features and a great look. It is very small and easily hidable, so are the songs. It holds barely six songs, not enough for 1/4 of a circuit at the gym."
5,Excellent,Pros:Great software Excellent support even in Win ME Great feel to the device USB Looks greatCons:You are going to have to wait at least 1 day to get hold of this amazing piece of technology :)A Must Buy!!
4,"Good size, good sound, great value","THE GOODS:-Very small, about the size of an egg.-Light enough (1.13oz) to run with without having it bounce around in your pocket.-Like all MP3 players, it won't skip, shaken or stirred.-Very durable.-Nice-quality earphones.-Crisp LCD.THE BADS:-Non-expandable or upgradeable; only plays MP3s.-Cumbersome computer software.-Only three buttons on player; basic functions like volume, turning off, and EQ switching takes some getting use to.OVERALL: Well worth the cost, and a great player to begin with. The 32MB model can hold about 6-8 songs, but if you are looking for more memory, try the 64MB model, which is obviously a bit more expensive. The only real downside to the Mini-Yepp is that its memory cannot be expanded or its software upgraded. All in all, I would highly recommend this player."
2,Yepp is small in size but large in eating batteries,"The samsung is by far the smallest MP3 player I have found. It can fit into that small little pocket in the front of your jeans.If you compress the songs enough, you can fit about 9 of them on the 32 mb. But why even bother when a regular Duracel AAA battery lasts only 1.5 hours playtime. I've spent more on batteries than I did on the player. I advise you to buy something that is rechargeable."
4,The most bumping by the oz,"Wow this thing is light!!! The sound quality is awesome too. Just keep one thing in mind before purchasing it, its for putting in your pocket!!! with the little chain clip thing, cant' really clip it to your shirt or anywhere else without the risk of it falling off.I actually thought it was a arm strapped one. LOL don't even remember where that idea came from when ordering it. was kinda disappointed when I found out it wasn't. but not complaining, it works fine in my pockets and I love the sound quality."
4,For those with a passing interest in a pioneering rock band,"I'm not a Black Sabbath historian or really a fan. Just a classic rock enthusiast and a casual album collector. I liked their singles, so bought the CD. If you fall in that category as well, this should fit the bill!I would have paid a couple bucks just for the 7 or 8 minutes of ""War Pigs"" bliss. But liked all the tracks at least a little. There are the hit singles, an instrumental, a couple of slower songs, a bit of cartoon-y Satanism perhaps. (Tame and inoffensive by today's standards I assure you.)Yes, the serious collector should know that there are NO liner notes to speak of. However this is a good sound quality CD from a groundbreaking band at a good price!"
5,The Definitive Black Sabbath collection,"This is a collection of the greatest hits from the Ozzy Ozbourne era of Black Sabbath, and i have to say that it is the best era of Sabbath, and will always be my favorite. The cd i recieved was in great quality, although the front cover was obviously a scanned image cut to fit the cover. I won't complain because it is a wonderful cd."
4,Black Sabbath - 'Greatest Hits' (Hits Unlimited),"Ten track budget CD aimed (I'm sure) primarily at Walmart and Kmart shoppers. Only ten tracks - including the way over-played ""Paranoid"", ""Iron Man"" and ""War Pigs"" (although I fully appreciate when other bands cover this Sabbath gem). Couple of tunes here that I did like hearing that I haven't heard in awhile are the awesome (and dramatic) ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"", ""Tomorrow's Dream"" and ""Sweat Leaf"" - as I remember the late Ronnie James Dio doing a decent job on this tune, but it was on the actual 'Heaven And Hell' tour in 1980. Not sure if any legit recording of that trek even exists."
4,Perfect for the Sabbath novice,"If you're interested in checking out Black Sabbath this is the perfect introduction, if you don't wanna invest in one of the actual albums and just want to check out a few of their classic tunes than look no further, at it's core it's just a perfect sampling of the classic heavy metal that put them on the throne they sit today"
3,"Should have looked at the ""S"" more closely...","The stamp comes in a nice box and seems to be well made. I guess I should have looked more closely at the letter ""S"" though. I am disappointed because to me it doesn't look like a capital ""S"" but more like a fishhook (the curve at the top of the S is very small). I honestly thought I was shipped the wrong stamp. I will keep it and hope when we use it, it will look like an ""S""."
5,Very Good Stamp.,"I first would like to comment on the shipping time of this seller, which was phenomenal this arrived much earlier than its set date. When I received it I was instantly taken with how aesthetically pleasing it was. The best part by far is how well it works. When I tried this stamp for the first time I was astonished with how easily it came off and how clean it left the brass head. This was a phenomenal product which I would highly recommended to all people."
5,Must have material for dio fans,"For Dio fans, finding the Elf albums is difficult in any format. I did find the original Elf album re-released on CD, managed to find a reasonable cassette of Carolina County Ball, a Vinyl of LA 69 (US Carolina County Ball), and even got a copy of trying to burn the sun on Vinyl. This give you the later 2 elf albums Carolina County Ball and Trying to burn the sun on CD. It's Dio at his best and doing a much more blues sound, which is honestly well suited for his vocal range and tone. Of course, he took it to the next level with his move to rainbow and exploded into the metal world with Sabbath and then his own group DIO, but it is in the music on these two albums that you can feel his roots really dig in. Outstanding change of pace for people who think Dio is just a metal head. Match this stuff up to the best of Zepplin or Deep Purple any day. Must have."
2,It's alright,"I see this album gets top rating, but I must say that even if it's good - it's not musically anything like ""Holy diver"" or ""Heaven and hell"". It's not heavy metal, not even hard rock. Much of the music is piano driven rock so the average metal head might have some problems with this... Some songs are great like ""Liberty road"" but since this CD actually is two LP's it has a tendency to be a bit too much of the same in the long run.Personally I find Elf's self titled debut from 1972 better. And for the curious I can mention that original guitar player David Feinstein (who later formed a power trio called The Rods) is Ronnie James Dio's cousin."
3,Elf - 'Carolina County.. / Trying To Burn ...' (Connoisseur),"A good 2 lp's-on-one CD release of Elf's second and third albums,'Carolina County Ball'('74)and 'Trying To Burn The Sun'('75).A should-have for most Dio fans.One thing you need to keep in mind is that the material here isn't as well written or as strong sounding as,say his solo efforts or the CD's he'd done with Rainbow or Sabbath.It's decent early '70's hard rock.Some of the tracks I thought were impressive were ""Annie New Orleans"",""Do The Same Thing"",""Black Swampy Water"",""When She Smiles"" and ""Liberty Road"".See what you think.Line-up:Ronnie James Dio-vocals,Mickey Lee Soule-keyboards,Steve Edwards-guitar,Craig Gruber-bass and Gary Driscoll-drums."
5,old college avenue,"Larry Levis was my friend, mentor, teacher, and advisor for my MA in English (1980) at the University of Missouri Columbia...this book is filled with great remeberances and commentary.On the other hand there is a section by ML Williams that is some sort of opinion grounded in an untruth...I beg to differ with the reasons for Larry's need to be alone to write...not sure how Lou reached her conclusions. Other than this one flawed commentary, the book itself remains a good eulogy.I very much enjoyed Southwick sharing the early days of their marriage and reminding me of the time when they lived at the Tiger Motel."
2,"It's just a lunch bag, insulation is literally paper thin!",Wanted something to keep cool perisable food/snacks for my toddler. This is not it. I wouldn't trust this to keep dairy products and meats fresh in the NYC hot summer days. It's just basically a fabric lunch bag. Keep researching if you actually need an insulation lunch bag....
3,Nice Bag!,This is a good bag for kids to carry lunch but not quite strong enough or big enough for an adult to use!
3,Very Small,"This lunch tote is much smaller than the photo of it. It is just right for a child, but not for a grown up. It is very light weight. I recommend it for a small child."
2,Mediocre,You are getting what you paid. It is a servicable lunch bag. Not sure how it stays insulated due to the cheap materials. Small but holds what I need. My main gripe is the zipper does not work sometimes.
5,Lunch Cooler Bag,"This is a very useful item-I use mine for my diabetic supplies. As well, the color makes it easier to see in low light situations.Very handy, and can be used for travel with an ice bag inside."
3,ok.,this is a nice lunch carrier and does the job. very basic but great for the price. the price matches the size and no problems at this point.
3,A little on the small side,"I received this lunch bag a little later than expected. The quality of the fabric is surprisingly good . However, it is a lot smaller than I expected. Still a good buy for the price but dont expect to put too much food in it cause it will not fit."
2,you get what you pay for,"I wasn't looking for a lot in a lunchbox....just something to take 2 bottles and some snacks back and forth from daycare for a 13 month old. However, this was even flimsier than I was expecting. It gets the job done, but it's small and just ok. I kept it and I use it, but I would not buy it again. Next time I'll shell out the extra few bucks for one that insulates better."
4,As described.,"The insulated lunch cooler is just about what I expected. It is rather small and not SUPER insulated, but it certainly does the job and is convenient to use. Doesn't seem to leak and is easy to clean. The color I ordered (orange) is a little obnoxious, but I'm satisfied."
3,Good but on the Smaller Side,This is a good bag for a SMALL lunch. If you intend to have plastic container and a water bottle in the bag at the same time it won't fit.
3,A good solid bag,"This is a good solid lunch bag. It's easy to clean and wash. It could be a tad larger. And the strap could be a little longer so I could easily sling it over my shoulder.And beware the shipping can be more than expected because when I ordered it, it didn't ship from Amazon and I couldn't take advantage of having it bundled with my purchases shipping directly from Amazon."
1,Cheap lunch bag,I was not happy with this lunch bag at all. The minute I opened the box I could see that it was made from cheap quality materials. And it was way smaller than I was expecting it to be. I could have lived with it as long as it did the job- but it didn't. I had the bag 6 days and the zipper broke! Overall I was disappointed with the whole thing and will not consider purchasing this brand again.
2,Too small,I purchased this lunch box for a middle schooler assuming it would be the size of a six pack cooler. In reality it was smaller. It would be OK for a younger child but not big enough for an older child; especially when you add a water bottle in as well.
1,You get what you pay for,"For 4 bucks and change (plus over $5 shipping), this is worthless except for children. Don't expect much insulation from the very thin walls - that means do not pack anything you want to stay cold very long into this.Overall: Looks cheap, probably will not last over 6 months. In case you're wondering: Made In China."
1,"Cheap, 1.00 Store Item",The item is over priced for what it is. The insulation is paper thin. I would NOT recommend purchasing this item. I would value this item @ 1.00 and not one penny more. Buyer beware.
1,Awful,Zipper was sewn on wrong. Couldn't open the bag. Wasn't worth making the return so I just tossed it. Find another option.
3,Lunch Cooler,"Insulated Lunch Cooler BagThis bag is one of the few that I have found in pink, which is what I really wanted. The size was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, even with the dimensions that they gave in the description. I like the overall versatility of the bag with the front and side pouches. I just wish that it was a bit larger. Once you put a freezer pack in, there isn't much room for your lunch and a drink. I will only purchase another one if it is for a child's lunch or snack, which for that it would be perfect."
5,Insulated Pink Lunch Cooler Bag,"It was amazing to see a package on my doorstep, two days later after the lunch bag was ordered! The lunch bag looks exactly like the depiction and has been durable throughout months of wear. I would order again from this vendor."
5,Lunch cooler bags,They are perfect for kids daily lunches. Would like to order more but don't where to start. Lost all the ordering information.
1,not impressed AT ALL!!,i PAID OVER 18.00 FOR A LUNCH BAG THAT IS SMALL ENOUGH FOR A TODDLER....WAY OVER PRIZED FOR SIZE AD QUALITY ...I WOULD NOT PURCHASE FROM THEM AGAIN
3,NO ADJUSTABLE SHOULDER STRAP!!!,"The main reason I ordered these lunch bags for my school-age children was the adjustable shoulder straps, as indicated in the 'product features' section. Absolutely untrue. No shoulder strap, just a short carry handle. Totally useless for my needs. I'm sure this bag would have been fine had it actually had the features it claims in product description.EDITED TO ADD: raised the rating to 3 stars, not because of the product, but because of the companies prompt customer service. After emailing the seller with and inquiry about returning the item, Shop123go was very prompt in their response and offered to send me a different lunch bag, with an adjustable strap, at no charge. So, the seller was 5 star, but the product, to me, is somewhat useless without a longer shoulder strap."
5,One of the best ever,"Although I usually only listen to the first two tracks, this is probably the best U2 investment I ever made. I agree with all of the others who said that the live version of ""One"" on this record is phenominal and the duet with Pavoratti is haunting but brilliant. If you love U2 and want something truely rare then do yourself a favor and pick this up."
4,"Awsome, just awsome!",The first two songs on this CD are just spectacular. Especially the 2nd track.... That is a live version of the song One. It will bring tears to your eyes!
2,Beautiful Idea - Poorly Written,"This is a spectacularly beautiful story andthe characters have the potential to become memorable. The setting is exotic and fascinating. HOWEVER, the book is poorly written in the sense that the characters, though endearing, are not well-developed and are rather flat. The plot, though full of potential, is inconsistent in its movement. The research is incredible, but is not incorporated very well into the story: it's like reading a story with an academic essay mixed in at odd parts. I was just disappointed because the book showed so much promise, but was poorly written and developed."
1,Not worth the effort,"I could NOT get into this book at all. I finally gave up. With so many books on my list, I decided it wasn't worth it to continue. The writing seems stagnant. There was no drive to the story."
3,"Almost, but not quite","This book is a terrific first effort, and i don't feel that the ending is a cop out, but rather that the rest of the book did not do enough for me to earn that ending. Beautiful, evocative, yes. but it could do with about a hundred more pages to really get into all of the possibilities and explore this world and this story. Overall i would say that i found this book to be too superficial, that Payne does not trust her characters enough to go deep with them, and that there is so much more to be told."
1,Such a disappointment,"I had tremendous excitement when I purchased this book, as it seemed to hold the promise of many themes of importance to me: the craft of rug weaving, feminism, the desire of the artist to express his vision. However, after page 3 I knew that the promise would not be held.Meandering plot, uninspired prose, flat characters (that could have been very rich), inattentive writing (""she ate a Turkish apricot""...of course, she plucked it from a tree in Turkey, where else would it have been from?), confusion due to lack of dialog tags reinforced by lack of clarity of speakers, weak research, and the most aggravating of all, incorrect spelling and mangling of the Turkish language when used in dialog. That I could not forgive, as it cast doubt on the entire premise of authenticity. The ending is jarring, awful and absurd.This book does have some nice passages, it exudes a quietness, but it truly was one of the weakest stories I have ever read."
4,in your ear,"Screen writer Holly Payne's novel is an unparalleled example of how to write realistic dialogue. Read it aloud, if only to yourself, and you will hear what I mean."
4,Good Read,"Aside from learning so much of the Afghanistan people's culture in the 1950's, the book is a well writtten, thoughtful story. My book club enjoyed it. Lack of dialogue tags is a little distracting."
2,Nice looking but inneficient,"What could go wrong with a product selling for four bucks plus another four for freight? Well, you get what you pay for. The silicone ripped on the first week of use and has been collecting considerable dirt while offering no protection to the screen.I would certainly not recommend this product. Look for alternatives rated with four stars or higher."
4,Here Is the Complete Track Listing Including Artists,"Track listing:1. So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star - The Byrds2. Piece of My Heart - Big Brother and the Holding Company3. Evil Ways - Santana4. Spinning Wheel - Blood, Sweat & Tears5. Rainy Day Woman #12 & 35 - Bob Dylan6. Kicks - Paul Revere & The Raiders7. Groovin' is Easy - The Electric Flag8. Hey Little Cobra - The Rip Chords9. The Weight - Al Kooper & Mike Bloomfield10. Mercy, Mercy, Mercy - The Buckinghams11. Down in the Boondocks - Billy Joe Royal12. Time Has Come Today - The Chambers Brothers"
2,"Hibari-san is always cool, but...","It doesn't specify anywhere on the product that these are all very early songs of Hibari Misora. Her voice is always great, but I think she is primarily known for her later works. I would have opted to buy a CD that was not primarily made up of her earlier recordings."
4,Best for studying jazz-vocalists,"Some books with mousic score and lyrics are not available in other countries except the land of their authors. It's difficult situation for those, who are studying jazz in Europe, for example. That's why Internet shopping make impossible things possible. That's why I'm so happy, that I can listen beautiful jazz standards performed by unforgettable Frank Sinatra and guests and now I can see the lyrics, notes and I can learn them. It's amazing. This book will help me learn more american jazz standards, more english, and give me lots of satisfaction singing them with my jazz band."
2,Another pathetic college algebra book,"The marketing machine for Stewart's books is working wonders, but the books aren't. Too many colleges and universities are duped into adopting these books while students and conscious instructors exploit minimal benefit from them, specially in the problem sets, which are quite poor."
1,Stay away from this book if possible,"This book is the worst math book I ever had. I had to buy this for my class, but I barely take a look at it because the explanations are so messed up. They do things the long way and do thing more complicated, but the thing that bothers me the most is that their explanations can confuse you more than clarify things. This book has some bad editing because some of the answers in the back are wrong and they don't show the process of the problems. I only use this book for the homework assignments. I usually just jog down what the teachers says, which gives out better explanations which are shorter and clearer ways to do things."
5,"""SHERRY' MIXED WITH VINEGAR","I've been waiting years to write this review. I'm sick and tired of watching ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life' during the Christmas holidays and hardly ever seeing this outrageously funny holiday classic even listed or mentioned. Just check out the ratings;90% of the reviewers give it 5 stars! And why not? Woolley takes over someone else's house and proceeds to 'hold court"" following a fall which he milks to the brim.As Sheridan Whiteside, Woolley's a big shot and he knows it.He's on a first name basis with Eleanor Roosevelt, constantly interferes with family matters, and entertains everyone from Ann Sheridan to Jimmy Durante. Gifts include an octopus and an empty? mummy's casket. Bette Davis is apparently the lone sane figure, and Whiteside is determined to rule her as his secretary for life until... In short, it's the best holiday movie ever made. See for yourself!"
1,Great Movie.... Bad TAPE,I ordered this Great Christmas movie and looked forward to viewing it again... however the quality of the video I received was terrible! The contrast was so poorly transformed from film to video that all of the scenes are washed out and most of the time faces are just a white blur... I hope it was just my copy that was poor.... I did check it on a number of VCR's to make sure it was not the equipment... all with the same result.
5,Great transaction!,"I love this movie, and after a friend lost our copy, I wanted to replace it right away. The movie arrived quickly & was exactly as the description noted."
2,Audio content,"..My disappointment is solely with the audio content of the DVD...a bit fuzzy/grainy sounding. I'll live with it <?!>..key point of reference, disclose that up front, if you tout an item in ""very good"" condition, audio is an essential component!"
1,very disappointing,"Both my wife and I are big Bette Davis fans and the reviews for this movie were so strong I figured it was a sure thing. Unfortunately with the exception of some good one liners by Wooley, the whole thing is a noisy mess. Jimmy Durante is particularly annoying and maybe the movie could have earned a better rating with me without him. I like him alot in other movies, particularly in supporting roles with Esther Williams, but here he is just over the top. The story tries to mix too much and gets lost trying to weave the gags and storylines. I'm sure this will be an unpopular review but if you check my other ratings you will see that I rarely pan a film like this. It really was a letdown after the buildup of other reviewers."
1,Obnoxious bore parading as razor-sharp wit,"I'm a lover of many old classic B & W film comedies: Adam's Rib, Bringing Up Baby,and The Philadelphia Story, to name a few. I was really looking forward to seeing The Man Who Came To Dinner--until I did. I didn't think the main character's wit was funny, but rather contrived wit that was obnoxious and boring.And the owners of the house were a couple of doormats--the wife fawning to the critic, while the husband didn't have the guts to stand up to either one.After about 45 minutes of it, I couldn't take any more and stopped the film--so I can't say this review is completely fair since I didn't watch the whole thing. But I've seen thousands of films and I can say from experience that if I don't like a film after 45 minutes, 99% of the time I won't like the rest of it.This may have been funny stuff in 1942. If it was, it didn't age well."
1,Shouldn't Have Come,"What a horrible movie - not funny in the least - just tasteless,vulgar and loud. Bette Davis is good as usual but is almostbarely noticeable as required by her understated part.On the other hand Woolley is THE MOST OBNOXIOUS actor/personality/character I have EVER seen on the screen and makes you want torun from the room ASAP. Same with the horrible Jimmy Durante.This one is strictly for older people who think they have a senseof humor, but really laugh at vulgarity and rudeness."
5,Hill arious,"what a funny movie ,i couldnt stop laughing the whole cast was brilliant the only thing spooked me was the scene where they put Ann Sheridan in that mummy tomb, i wish they would have had a scene added to show she got out ok ,i know its just a movie but that part really bothered me i guess cause i panic getting a closed mri .lol?"
5,Finally!!,"the release of this dvd is such a pleasant thing for many reasons. First, it wasn't even released on VHS so it is finally available. Second, any Bette Davis release is a treat for both Davis fans and Classic movie buffs. Also, it is one of the rare occasions that Ms. Davis is truly not the star but part of an ensemble cast and in a comedy no less! Filmed during her prime years at Warner's, This is a different Bette, certainly not the Bette we think of so it is nice for those ""getting to know"" her to see how versatile and talented she was. No expansive emotions and gestures but a quiet, sweet and tender performance. The film is a bright and clever comedy with a great supporting cast including Mary Wickes, jimmy Durante and Billie Burke. A thoroughly enjoyable film that stands the test of time."
2,Why waste time watching this when you could be watching -,"- watching Now, Voyager or Mr Skeffington?Usually I like to watch a movie twice or even three times when I intend to review it. This one I just can't bring myself to give another chance. Monty Wooley was the star and so aggravating and predominating that Bette Davis' brilliant performance as his secretary was shadowed beyond recall. The best part that didn't involve Bette Davis was the climax when the lady got put into the mummy case. The only other good part that I recall was the skating scene with Bette and Boyfriend.That is all I can bring myself to say about this. Watch it if you like, but I advise you to rent it first. Then you can make your own judgement."
4,The Man Who Came To Dinner,Great adaption of the Broadway hit. Superb cast. Perhaps the best work by George Kaufman and Moss Hart.
4,Classic Movie,The DVD presented the movie in form in which it was intended. For lovers of the classic 1940's movies this movie is on point.
3,Good Movie,"I had to have this movie for a paper at school, I thought it was a good movie, good quality."
2,"Far-fetched and unexplained plot, but good writing/interesting premise/characters","This was intense and interesting, but the authors never gave a reason why the teens all acted out the same way and why it all happened at the same time. Also, the only way the ending works is if Coffey plans on a sequel, otherwise it just doesn't leave the reader with closure. A fast-paced, exciting read with a touch of romance, albeit feeling incomplete and a bit far-fetched; I'll probably give Coffey another try."
1,Don't Waste Your Time !,I have been a reader of Jan Coffey's books for quite some time but unless she changes her subject matter this will be the last.This is such a far-fetched subject(electral implants in childrens brains)that I don't know how she came up with it.If I was you I would not purchase this book but check it out at a library.The book is long drawn out and a very boring.
3,very good,this is a wonderful book.F I was the author\publisher I would reckomend for 5-adults.If i did my book this wouldn't be able to do it better.
3,Poor interface,This is a powerful 3D package with a horrible interface and an extremely steep learning curve. This version is a poor port from the PC side and runs horribly on the Mac platform. If you want to buy this program buy a PC to run it on.
2,far too expensive,"for anyone less than an ultra-profesional designer with a large bankbook, this is a waste of money. not only does it have a very steep learning curve, but for most people, it costs more than the computer they'll be running it on."
3,Eaay but confusing,"I found the book to be an easy read, with the chapters being so short, which was a plus. I did not, however, think that the story's organization was the best. The way that the author went from her childhood to teen yrs to marriage, to include her journal entries to her dead baby, was a bit confusing. The author totally skipped over, what I feel were pertinent parts of the story. It was like having a sandwich without the meat. It's a good book, but I could do without the flashbacks. It should have just went from beginning to end."
2,Reads like a slow misunderstood movie,"Yep, this is a B-movie for a book, slow, not sure where it was going and why am I reading it. I finished it but did not remember reading it."
1,Selah's Bed,"This book is terrible. I couldn't even finish it, and I am truly not happy that I wasted my money on it. I strongly discourage anyone else from purchasing this book."
1,NOT GOOD AT ALL !,"I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK AT ALL,ONLY THE LAST FIFTY PAGES WAS OKTHE BOOK IS ABOUT A WOMAN WHO HAS AROUGH CHILD HOOD AND NOW SHE IS HAVINGA HORRIBLE MARRIAGE. HER HUSBAND WILL NOTMAKE LOVE TO HER THE WAY SHE WANT HIM TOAND THE WAY HE USED TO, HE IS NOW A DECONAND HE KNOWS HIS WIFE IS SLEEPING WITH OTHER MENSHE ALSO CARRIES AROUND SOME KIND OF HATE FOR HERGRAND MOTHER FOR MAKING HER HAVE AN ABORTION WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER. THE TOPIC WAS GREAT BUT THE WAY IT WAS WRITTEN AND BOUGHT OUT WAS NOT GREAT AT ALL. THE BOOK WAS BORING !"
1,Save your money!,"Selah had the I.Q. of a tree, and so did I for reading this book. One of the worst that I have read. The author made a decent attempt; the story is possible , but the content of the writing was loose as jello. Save your money from this one."
3,"Back, back and forth and forth","This book felt like a roller coaster. The author takes you through Selah's life but not a straight path. She jumped from age 7 to late 30s back to early 30s then to 13...just all over. It made me frustrated.Selah had an abortion when she was 19. She married the father of that child, but harbored hate for him because of the abortion, so she had several affairs with different men....ok...well...whatever you need to get through but it just didn't make sense to me.If you're still feel confused...well I am too, so don't feel bad."
3,The shattered soul.,"Selah's Bed is a very concise story about a girl who experiences a lack of love and grows up a women who seeks it in the most primal form Sex.She can't love deeply and completely because emotionlly she is a shattered soul. In reading the book, I felt at times disturbed and sad but never bored.I like the raw honesty and flashblackes that takes the reader into the worlds of selah the chid vs selah the women. There were gaps I felt weakened the preciseness of the work such as, the omission of transition of selah after her abortion to selah as a married women. I found it pecular that her boyfriend did not seek her out while she was pregenat but then married her after she aborts their child. That just did not ring true with me.This book will get your attention but it portrays I felt the stereotypes of black -poor and fast females that is overrated in the media. I read it but felt disaappointed."
1,What an awful book!,"Selah Wells loves her husband, yet she constantly cheats on him. Of course, she comes from an unstable family (absent father, promiscuous mother) and Adams keeps on hammering her melodramatic background, to make sure one understands that it explains her current flaws. True, Selah is quite dumb, but the author shouldn't treat the reader as if he's stupid too--repeating the same facts over and over.The whole book looks like it could be the basis for one of those awful made-for-TV movies; the other characters are not much better (or more interesting) than Selah and, throughout the novel, Jenoyne Adams proves she has as much subtlety as a wrecking ball--and about as much talent ."
5,Still Grand After All These Years,"So many artists have come and gone during my 62 years. I can still remember when the Highwaymen's classic, ""Michael Row Your Boat Ashore"" hit #1. It was late summer here in New York 1960 I believe. Many old friends of mine have also come and gone, but my musical friends the ""Highwaymen"" are still standing. How grateful I am to still enjoy both their old and new recordings. Songs like Michael, Gypsy Rover still have the same haunting quality I never tire of hearing. In this live concert they still maintain that great sound they had when they first recorded. Do I recommend this cd you ask? Yessssssssssssss!"
2,Installation instructions is no good!,This product doesn't fit my car (BMW) properly. The instructions are not very clear and what I would consider useless. Will never buy again!!
3,betty crocker's new picture cook book,Book was the condition as stated on the order. It took an excessive long time to get the book once it was ordered - my account was quickly charges and it took 3 weeks to get the book. This is unacceptable.
2,Epic around the edges,"2 1/2In my search to devour all things ""progressive"", Pendragon came highly recommended, though ended up being just another watered down incarnation in the myriad of Genesis and Yes (with a little Floyd thrown in for good measure) derivatives, multiplying at alarming rates and consequently extinguishing fan's passion for the craft they initially fell in love with. Although the live show itself is spot-on, nothing really distinguishes investing in the non-studio output, as do the songs themselves, while being textbook pleasing in a dumbed-down, mod-prog context, rarely distinguish over similar fare. Although to their credit, once vocal-driven duties are paid, they do know how to close out a song in epically beautiful fashion and finally make listeners at home enviable of the live experience."
5,More than just a snack,"All natural and taste delicious. Great snack food or add to a dish.Taste great in wild rice, salads, yogurt."
3,Does it come in a smaller version?,I was going to get this for my mom until I saw that it was 5.7' long. My mom is only 5.4' tall so she probably would have a hard time using it or it would be much too dangerous.
4,"USB VOIP Phone, Support Skype, Messenger",GREAT PRODUCT FOR SKYPE. IT WORKS WELL. USED IT IN THE DOMINICAN AND AT HOME. ONLY DOWNFALL IS THE NUMBER PAD DOESNT WORK BUT IT DOESNT HAVE TO IF YOUR USING THE COMPUTER ANYWAY.
1,Does't work!,I needed help to set it up and it doesn't work. I wouuldn't recommend item to anyone else. Instructions for use not helpful.
2,Not the best quality,The screen protector has fallen out. Sometimes the sound is distorted. Not my favorite skype phone. Much prefer the phillips.
1,"Ok phone, not so good vendor","I brought this phone without looking at the reviews. Read them when the sound quality was not good and when I realised it was not providing me any more flexibility that using skype straight off my computer with a speaker and a mic. I mean why would I not buy a headset? Even if it were wired, it frees up my hands. I am anyways tied to the comp here.This dealer is not good at returns."
3,Ordering Amazon 'stock item',"When ordering Amazon ""stock items"" with free shipping I have discovered frustration. Items seem to be out of stock.Having had two items shipped from alternate suppliers has proven expensive and repeatedly without regard to promised delivery ETAs (by a week or more) or compensation for resultant inconvenience. It is almost as if the alternate suppliers have it out for Amazon. Where is the advantage?This phone works but entering the number cannot be achieved on the keypad...Ah well it works as long as my computer keyboard works. Instructions succinctly unclear. Welcome to my world. It is not worth the time or expense of returning to the provider. I never thought I'd say that, but there it is."
1,Enclosed software could not recognize the phone,"Another wonderful investment of mine in the realm of garbage. In brief, after loading the phone's software (WinXP), it never recognized the phone when I plugged it into the USB port. (There are two programs that run in systray.) As a result, when I opened Skype, nothing happened, even though Skype had automatically set my default audio settings to the phone.I was unable to find any help or updated drivers online. I'd thrown away the packaging so I couldn't return the phone. After a few days, I tossed the phone, too. What a freaking waste of money. The sparse docs were in the broken ""english"" that we see so much of in today's ""qualityless"" world. That should've been a tipoff."
2,NOT FOR WINDWS 7 - 64BIT,"Nice looking handset. Disappointed because I cannot get it to work with WIN 7 (64-bit) following several attempts - even after downloading and installing the latest manufacturer updates as recommended on the accompanying CD jacket.My nephew reports that it worked flawlessly on his WINDOWS-XP Laptop. I believe it should work fine with any XP machine, so I am sending it to him to use with his WIN-XP Desktop as well."
2,Does not completely work with messenger,"I bought this phone to use with msn messenger. It installed OK on Windows 7 64 bit, and messenger recognizes it as a sound device. It will send and receive messenger calls and the audio is really good. But if you want to actually use the phone keys to dial, answer, or hang up, forget it, the keys don't work with messenger. It won't even ring. You have to use the dial pad on the computer for all entries."
4,Good VoIP Phone,Bought this phone just for Skype usages. Audible is fine on both ends.Works with Window 7 32 bit & 64 bit. Though the 32 bit takes a little longer to load the drivers.Did not use Skypemate to activate phone functions. It's easier for me to use Skype's window softkeys.
4,"The biggest ""cell"" phone I ever had!","A great little device for the price! That's not a bad thing, I like things that work like they cost big bucks but don't.I have a blind musician friend and if he tells me something sounds good it does. He loved the audio from this phone and I could hear him like that TV commercial where the two guys have their heads together. LoL!I installed the software it suggested and the phone installed it's drivers and it worked with Skype right away. I set up the computer so it would stay on when I closed the cover and I put it in my backpack and as long as I have a wifi signal, ""Skype Out"" credit and the software running (always!) I can make great calls.The box says it's a wifi phone that works with Skype of course but it also seems that it should work with other VOIP software but it really likes Skype. Oh well, so do I!Thanks for an inexpensive product that performs so well!"
2,Cheap is Cheap,The other reviews for the item were misleading. The instructions were for a phone of a different model. No instructions on what driver to use. Poor quality. Doesn't have full functionality... for example the button functions are unknown and you can't dial numbers from the phone just from the Skype interface.Positives: cheaper than the arm and a leg Skype charges for a handset which makes it passable for rare usage or a knock-around phone.My Opinion: Spend a few extra dollars and get a phone you wont be annoyed by or be embarrassed to show others. Z/Z
4,Great little phone for the price,Sound quality is OK. There is a slight 1/2 second delay when speaking with someone on a land line. Otherwise the phone works wonderfully.
5,Better than most phones I have!,"The phone does appear and install (and works) without the driver installed, however (the first reviewer stated this as well) the ringer is not that loud. UNLESS you install the driver software, then it is actually VERY loud. And also the buttons do not work on the phone until you install the driver (which integrates perfectly into XP and Skype).When the Phone is disconnected, it will default back to your soundcard automatically, so if you get a call it will always work one way or the other. It has an LCD display which displays useful information (caller ID and length of call, and time date) but does NOT display unless the drivers are installed. So I suggest installing the drivers, even though the basic sound functions DO work without it.Very economical and VERY GOOD deal."
4,"Works great, great bargin","Works great and is a good bargain. Only drawback is having to use it with the PC on, works fine with Google Voice though the keypad is useless hopefully there will be a Google Voice add-in available sometime that allows better integration. Skype functions fine with the included SkypeMate add-in. Sound quality is good, speaker is very loud and quality of sound is very good."
5,2ND USB Phone,"This is the second phone of this type i have purchased,They come in several brand names but look like they come from same factory.make sure you load latest SKYPMATE software for best usability."
1,"disappointed, too bad the support was wrong",did not work on windows 7 for italk bb. I got advice from the seller it would work.Just use it for the 4 servers it is intended for.
2,Does not work fully for yahoo mesenger and others,"Phone does not work fully for MSN or yahoo messenger, maybe does not work either for other than Skype, if you use other than skype then the keypad won't work , if you are trying to avoid using the computer keyboard and if you are not running skype do not buy this phone."
2,Pretty flimsy phone but the price is right,"I bought 3 Skype phones: US Robotics (which, based on their phone support is not their product; they put their name on it but don't support it, this phone, and the Phillips cordless.This phone was by far the worst. The sound quality is poor. The buttons don't work very well. It did not work well with the version of Skype and Skypemate that I use, which is the most current one.Although I feel that either of the other phones are worth the additional money, this is one that I sometimes use because I keep it in an unlocked desk in an office where I am often absent. It's nice not to need to bring one of the other phones with me. It's small, doesn't take up much space, and if someone stole it, I would feel that hopefully it had found a more supportive home."
3,OK but not great,"My daughter really wanted this set. I thought it had too many paper pieces that are easily crushed or destroyed. The candles on the cake are already lost. We do love most of the Calico Critters stuff, but this set was not the best."
3,Good socks but wore out fast,"I've bought several pairs of Smartwool socks in my area, but nobody carries dress socks. I bought these for work, and they are comfortable for work use. Exactly what I bought them for.The only issue I have run across is after only 8-9 months the heel is completely worn away. My other Smartwool socks have lasted more than a couple years without this problem."
2,These socks are very thin and I wonder if they are fake smartwool socks?,The socks were very thin and not as warm as other smartwool socks that I have purchased. The logo peeled off after the first wash which makes me wonder if I got seconds or even imitation smartwool socks. I am not pleased at all.
5,"perfect for wet, cold northwest","My cotton socks start failing me in the Winter when the weather here gets moderately cold and the air full enough of moisture to chill you to the bones. We like to say the cold goes right through your clothes.When I'm skiing a pair of SmartWool socks is my go to. So with that in mind I purchased these to see how I'd like them. In short, they're great for me. My feet stay nicely warm and these are well constructed.Just wish they cost less but they're worth it."
4,Good - I'd buy them again,"Warm, they look good and are the right thickness for dress shoes. I like these very much and will buy more."
3,What a guitar player!,"The Motor City Madman is one of the best guitar player of all time, and his is a collection of songs from his first 7 albums. All the songs are some what good but I would only recomend this to big Nugent fans, because the albums are a lot better then this, but if you are a really big Nug fan then you must get this. But I personaly would recomend getting his first albums Ted Nugent, Cat Scratch Fever, and Scream Dream because on those albums the band really shines. This isnt that band either though. But I would not recomend this."
5,At last: a comprehensive history of the Vikings!,"Roesdahl's work has allowed me to see the Vikings as much more than a band of maruading pirates. -Much more than actors who appear in the annals of history to relieve the monotonoy of un-inspired court tomage, the task of reconstructing Viking culture is related in a rich and fascinating adventure. This Roesdahl translation relates how the Vikings, far from being merely a sea-fairing chapter of the ""Hells Angels"", actually had many customs, artifacts, and lands that can be equated into the european calendar using dendrochronology. With so many ""viking values"" being adopted by modern man, this work is invaluiable to understand where our world is going, as well as where it has been. I just wish that I could put a copy of it on my web-site!"
4,Almost Perfect,"This was the firs book I have read on the subject and even though I was already familiar with some aspects of the Viking life it was very interesting and informative. The book deals with every thing in great detail, from the houses in which the Vikings lived in to the shoes the wore. Unfortunately the chapter about warfare was a little short and, in my opinion lacked many details and wasn't as comprehensive as I hoped it would be. Also, I think a few battle descriptions would have been nice.Overall, a great book and a wonderful introduction to a fascinating culture ! 4 out of 5"
3,3.5 stars,"That's what I'd give this book (if I could). Of course it's a translation; the original Danish title may have been better but I don't really consider it worth buying to find out.Overall, this is a very good general introduction to the Viking world. It covers a lot of ground but sometimes only touches on areas where you might like to have seen more detail. One particular aspect I'd have liked to have read more on was Viking-era warfare - a very important topic. But this title doesn't even mention the classic tactic of the shield wall.I'd recommend this book as a first book on the Vikings, but not as a definitive volume. There is too much material to cover and this book is too brief. I read Foote & Wilson's ""The Viking Achievement"" some years back, which is a rather larger book, and I remember being more taken with that as a single volume reference book for things Viking.Next up is Jones' book on the Vikings, followed by the newer book by Ferguson, to see how they compare to this."
2,Vikings?,"Not much to say about this book because before i even got half way through I put it away. No doubt there is tons of history in this book. I feel the history is more about geographical purposes of Scandinavia than vikings. The author even says multiple times regarding many topics that ""not much is known about this.......but it most likely....."" No doubt its great history, but vikings? Id rather read historical fiction about vikings, at least I would get a little more information dealing with vikings."
4,A big warm hug for your ears,"If you're a fool for great singing, the next CD you should buy is Marty Winkler's latest, ""Kissing Minneapolis Goodbye"". Winkler's prodigious vocal gifts, coupled with nearly-telepathic harmonies (Kate Bordeaux and Katy Thomasberg) will wrap your ears in a long, warm and loving embrace. The songs are sultry (""Summertime""), playful (""Stranger In The Mirror""), sexy (""Go Slow""), transcendent (""What A Wonderful World""), and life-affirming (""O Thomas"") - but always revealed through Winkler's remarkable, incandescent singing. Live vocals don't get better than this!"
4,bulbs are fine,"if you own i fixture for these bulbs, then you know they just aren't that bright. so don't expect these to make your hard corals to grow. it's not the bulb, you just need more power, or a t5."
4,Lasted over 4 years...,"but now the 2nd handset in 6 months has ""died"". I have the maximum # of handsets (4). Amazon's price for a replacement handset/base is ridiculous. When the first handset went bad this past winter (the first one to go bad after over 4 years of perfect performance), I found a replacement on the Web for a very reasonable price. I thought I'd bookmarked that site, but I guess not. If I can't find a reasonably-priced replacement, then I'll just live with 3 handsets till the next one goes, then I'll look to replace the entire set.The features of this set are awesome and VERY reliable. And 4 years is a pretty good run. Going to give it more stars."
5,Rare Byrds Compilation On CD From 1996.,"While there's no denying that this is a rather strange and certainly very short collection, I rather like it.Maybe because sometimes I don't have time for a longer album, so this at 30 minutes play is just about right.Weak songs to me are Old Blue and America's Great National Pastime.The rest are at the very least good and in the cases of Old John Robertson and Yesterday's Train, out of the top drawer.The former is a wonderful song with phased guitar and moog sounds, very inovative for 1967-1968.The latter has a slow, dreamy vocal and excellent pedal steel guitar.By far not the best of The Byrds, however I suggest it's merits outweight any downsides."
4,Not a toy,My granddaughter just loves her bed. Can be a little noisy but children don't seem to mind. We'll see how long it takes to spring a leak. Her old bed lasted several years with a lot of sleepovers. Don't plan on using the foot pump unless you want the exercise and have time.
2,CHUNKS AFTER SHAKING IN WATER,"I am not knew to protein isolates and after reading the reviews I ordered the Vanilla. If you like to quickly shake your protein in water, this is not the product to buy. I will not use this product again. I do use other isolates that taste better and cost less. I'll have to use this up with a blender and will never order this product again."
2,Too Sweet,"I should have tried it before I bought a 2 lb container. I got the Vanilla one because it had the best reviews but it's too sweet for my taste. It leaves a weird after taste, kind of like Aspartame. I'm usually fine drinking soda, chocolate milk , or eating sweet stuff, etc, but I hate the sweet after taste of Aspartame and this definitely has a similar after taste."
4,Good protein,"I really like this whey protein, it has a good taste and good price for the quality..I have been using this protein 1 year ago and it really works after work out sessions"
5,One of the best Protein Powders,"I have tried a lot of protein powders over the past few years trying to find the one that best fits my needs. This one I must say, is the best one yet! As a woman trying to loose weight and maintain thereafter, I wanted a protein powder that was low in calories and sugar and with a good amount of protein but not over the top. The serving size is two scoops but I only use one scoop per serving with two shakes a day. It also helps that this is all natural and it's not too sweet which is also a plus!! GREAT stuff!"
3,A different Now Whey Protein Isolate flavor,"This flavor, Toffee Caramel Fudge, has a very strong scent when you open the bottle. The taste is good-I'd say this is a very rich flavor. If your stomach is sensitive, stick to the Unflavored, Dutch Chocolate, Strawberry or Natural Vanilla flavors."
4,"great isolate powder, marginal taste","Great isolate product! Mixes great and is all natural. Has lots of BCAAs which is a plus. I hate when people rag on the taste of supplements, but this powder is not sweet at all, what I'd call flat tasting. Again, not a huge deal b/c I just pound the mix of either powder/milk or powder/water. But some people make a big deal of the taste. I did just try ON Gold Standard and its taste is superior to NOW's."
5,good stuff,"Recently started using this....mixes great, tastes pretty good and packs a good protein punch (with bcaa's), with low calories, sat fat and especially cholesterol. I plan on ordering again, but was thinking of taking a blend or casseinate protein before bedtime instead of this one. Other than that, great product."
1,Tastes too synthetic...YUCK!,I ordered this product after reading some fairly good reviews. Thankfully I ordered the 1 lb. container. This was the most synthetic-tasting protein powder I have ever tasted. The taste is so horrendous that I would have given it no stars. It also gave me such painful gas just after one scoop of this stuff. I've used Jay Robb's in the past and I'll stick with that. At least it doesn't give me gas and it's much more palatable.
1,Overpriced! 70 servings for $99 competitor sells 81 for $65 pure isolates!!!,"The value of the content sucks! It says 10lb I was tricked thinking that it's better than 5lb sold by competitor. WRONG. 5lb has 81 servings and thins one only 70 servings. Each serving is 25g of protein not 50. so it's 35 50gram servings. The competitor brand has same 25grams per servings 81 servings per container, and cost only $65!!!!!! Other than that if you pass gas I bet it'll be the worst dutch oven ever experienced with this particular product %)"
1,Yuk!,I bought this whey protein because I wanted to supplement protein every now and then and I need to mix with water. It tasted horrible. Maybe it would be better with milk. I haven't tried it that way. I did use it in a low carb zucchini bread recipe and it worked well.
2,Bad Taste,I should have looked further prior to order and realized this had no flavor only a bad flavor
1,Horrible Service,I ordered this product for my husband on Friday May 8th and I still had not received the product by May 25th. I checked with Amazon and the seller and they said they would look into it. We did not receive any service in terms of refunds or shipping another protein mix from the seller. I would never purchase from this seller again. I was grateful that Amazon refunded me because we had not received the product. I would highly recommend buying this product from a different seller. Thank you!
4,nice product,Nice product but I would like to see the protein percent a bit higher. It is still competitiive though in price and quality. the flavor is so so but what can you expect for whey.
4,Really flavorless!,"I'm so sick of ""chocolate"" protein that advertises ""great taste!"" but really ends up tasting like sucking on dirty pocket change. This one really, truly doesn't taste like much, so if you blend it into your smoothie, all you will taste is your smoothie. I've also put it in mashed potatoes, and that works great too. Just don't try to mix it with any kind of hot liquid; it will curdle into gross clumps."
2,They should be brought to court for lying,"Right on the front it says ""Mixes instantly!"". Well, let me tell you, this is an outright LIE. In fact, it is the slowest mixing protein powder I have EVER used, and that includes about 5 brands. Tried strawberry and plain. Cheap flavoring for sure, if you want flavor, go with Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard.It mixes so bad, it's almost unbearable. However, I have found that if you stir it up as good as you can, then let it SIT for about 30 minutes, it DOES eventually mix in, but it sucks waiting, and if you can't wait, you have no choice but to ""chew"" your protein drink.Finally, the scoop they give you is shaped like a fricken trapazoid...and makes you SPILL if you try to pour it into a sports bottle. I think they did this on purpose so you'll spill and have to buy more. Who in the world came up with that shape? Ever heard of ROUND???If a smooth mixing protein matters to you, DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT buy Now brand!!! You have been warned."
2,"Worst tasting, hard to mix","I will make this as short as possible. I got the Natural Vanilla. It is by far the worst tasting protein I've ever had. I've mixed it with water, skim milk, and orange juice, and it's still horrible. I have to chug it down without breathing. Which brings me to my next reason for dislike. It does not mix well. I tried mixing it in a shaker with the wire ball, a small personal hamilton beach blender, and my full sized Ninja blender. I still get clumps. Lots of them. There is nothing worse than chugging down a protein shake that tastes bad, than getting a large clump."
5,Works great!,"This is the only whey protein powder that mixes easily. I stir when I am pouring the powder into the glass. However, I am not worried about clumps because if one waits a few minutes, the powder dissolves completely. It is a nice consistancy that is easy to drink. I mix the protein in water and I sweeten it with a few drops of liquid stevia (SweetLeaf). The stevia does not add calories and is a natural product. Also, you get a lot of protein grams for the calorie count."
4,As advertised,This protein powder mixes well and really doesn't have an after taste. I mix a few tablespoons with yogurt or make a lean shake with it and it tastes pretty good!
4,Review,"Lets start out by saying i have been using this for a month now,it came fast, sealed tight. it doesnt taste too bad, and it seems to be helping alot with the recovery after i lift weight. I dont know if ill keep using it, i may try optimum nutrition's whey gold , seem to read alot about that. i lift an hour a day 5 days a week and I want to make huge gains in strength and muscle,(without roids) so thats why i want to see if theres something better, but i do recommend this product."
4,Great source of quality protein without the additives,"I am a huge proponent of NOW brand Whey Protein Isolates. I have tried 6-7 different brands and always come back to NOW. In addition to being free of aspartame, sucralose and artificial ingredients, NOW brand WPI is easy to digest because it contains only cross-flow micro-filtered isolate, the best protein available. I have tried the chocolate and now the strawberry, both of which are delicious in water and milk. My one complaint about the strawberry is that it is very prone to clumping. I will try to use warmer water as one person mentioned, or find that damn shaker whisk ball, but this is the only reason it is not 5 stars. Great product otherwise, the smartest choice for protein supplementation in my mind."
4,Predictable but good,I found the book to be a good story that doesn't bog down the reader with a bunch of psyhcological garbage that you usually find but instead provides nonstop action that makes for fun reading. It does tend to be a bit predictable but still good.
2,Not Up To Standard,"I absolutely LOVED the first three books. So much so that I actually sent an e-mail to the authors thanking them for some very enjoyable reads. I awaited Sherman and Cragg's latest work with anticipation.In this case I was very disappointed. The book felt had a hasty, unfinished quality. As usual, the authors characterizations were superb. You can really believe in a Sherman and Cragg character. What was left out was plot.The story made very little sense and there was almost no plot development. Points were seemingly brought up at random and then dropped. I found it to be a very frustrating read. There were just too many points left unexplored. I can usually ""suspend disbelief"" and enjoy a sci-fi book for what it is....fiction. This book left me cold.Some authors go too far with background material, this book gives you none."
2,OK,"The characters were interesting but the plot was boring. I enjoyed their friendships and their bonds. However, too much time was spent on the past. While explaining each character's past was informative, too much time was spent revisiting and I found myself bored. I also thought that Roz and Tam's conflict should have been explored more. I was disappointed that the author did not explore how Roz dealt with Hiriam and his infidelity. What, their life went on without any discussion about his affair with one of her best friends. I doubt it. I would not recommend this book."
1,Bad Plot,"I finished the book unsatisfied. The character development was complicated, unfinished, and boring. The storyline(s) were so hard to follow. And why would you give one character two or three nicknames (Arnethea), I could never tell who they were talking about or talking to. Pure disappointment!"
2,Hard Book to Follow,"This book never did come together for me. It was hard to get to know the characters because they were so underdeveloped and left a lot of unanswered questions. Like what happen to Hiram & Roz after she found out about his longtime affair?Also, because of the way the book was written, it was hard to follow who was talking. I would read a couple of paragraphs and then have to go back and try to figure out who was talking. It was tough finishing this one!"
2,COULN'T FINISH IT,"I thought this would be a great book, but I was mistaken. It has been sitting on my shelf for over 2 months, with the book mark in the same page. This is the first and last time, I will ever buy a book written by Lorene Cary."
2,nothing outstanding,"Although I read this book in one sitting, I was very disappointed in how the book flowed and the ending. I kept expecting more. Each chapter was devoted to one of the four main characters with the final chapter devoted to Audrey, who I felt was the least established character in the book. The bookcover was breathtaking and caught my eye, but this is one author who will have to work very hard on the second book if she expects me to become a repeat purchaser as well as recommend her to other readers."
1,a disappointment,"When i saw the colorful images on the cover of the book, i knew i had to read Pride. Unfortunately, once i started it i realized that although the cover was bright, the content was extremely bland. the plot was interesting enough, Cary just had a difficult time making it come alive. I got close to the end, put it down for some reason and never bothered to pick it up again."
2,LESS IS MORE,"While there were some interesting people in this book, I was like the reader from Ohio. I couldn't get past chapter two and haven't picked it up since.There were some interesting people in those first two chapters and some of the incites were original and funny, but I had trouble keeping up with who and what and gave up the ghost. A stronger focus was needed and I hope she does it for her next one. She is a good writer, but her storyline needs to be more fine tuned."
3,About women you can relate to.,"Pride explores the triumphs that women endure as they go through life. It examines the heart of being a black woman...our PRIDE. Although you may not exactly relate to the situations of the characters, we all have dealt with struggles as we seek happiness & try to hold onto our pride. As with Carey' s characters, it is often our friends who help us through. The book doesn't read fast but it is does read steady and I think you'll be glad you tried it."
2,Too many stories....,"The novel might have been better with one or two fewer characters. Even though the book is written in a format which focuses on each character for a few chapters at a time, I think these women have so many ISSUES, so many stories, that it is impossible to ""flesh them out"" in the book. As a result, I couldn't empathize with these women, nor could I sympathize for them. I also had a problem with the believability of the characters;i.e., Arneatha, when a child is pressed into her arms at the airport, simply boards the plane with the child--instant single-motherhood; Tamara, denied tenure at a NY college, moves back to Philly, with no visible means of support; Audrey is allowed to design a program for recovering alcoholics when she has yet to recover herself"
2,PRIDE should have made me leave this book on the shelf!,"For anybody who is reading, May God be with you! The ONLY reason I am giving this book two stars is because when the affair was exposed, the emotional turmoil began. That part was very interesting. After that, there was nothing to invest in because there was nothing left. The title should have been renamed, well, I can think of a few choice words to use on the cover. Believe me, PRIDE wouldn't have made the list."
2,Confusing,"I normally make every attempt to finish a book,even if I'm not feeling it. Well,with this book,I could not continue on after page 179.I couldn't get into it at all."
1,ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS,THERE WERE TO MANY CHARACTERS. WHEN READING YOU HAD NO IDEA WHO WAS TALKING. NO REAL PLOT. I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS BOOK WAS PUBLISHED. A WASTE OF MONEY.
1,Terrible!,This has to be the dumbest book I have ever read in my life! I'm sorry I wasted my money on it! The characters were undeveloped and the author never said what when on between Roz and Tam. I didn't even finish the book I was so disgusted. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!
2,Interesting characters......difficult plot,While all the characters in Pride are ones that most people can relate to or have had similar curcumstances in their lives. The flow of the book was at best difficult to follow. I had to make myself read the entire book. It is not one that I will recommend my friends go and purchase. The conflict between Roz and Tam was never resolved....how disappointing.
1,Do NOT WASTE Your Time,"This book, to put it nicely, was not one of my favorites.. It was a sleeper and waste of my tiome and money. Too, too much drama and not enough sense or purpose. Better Luck Next Time"
3,An Excellent Read!,"When my book club selected Pride, I had never read anything by Cary. I will definitely buy Black Ice.Pride reads more like classical literature rather than a novel. I think this is the problem a lot of the readers are having - it's not a harlequin romance.I disagree with readers who say that the conflict between Roz and Tam was never resolved. Roz forgave her husband and terminated contact with her friend. While it would have been more dramatic for Roz to throw her husband out, it is unrealistic expectation of a politicians wife (witness Hillary Clinton and Gary Hart's wife).I found the characters so well developed that I had mental pictures of them. I know black women similar to each of the characters.I hope Cary writes another soon."
2,Laborous Reading,"I felt ""Pride"" lacked all the components that would make a frienship based book sizzle. The introductory chapter left reader trying to comprehend the character of the book. Lorene Cary should have introduced the characters individully before throwing them all together like gumbo at the wedding. Not even the added conflict betwen Roz and Tam could of saved this book. I was doomed from the begginnng.Lorene Cary failed to provide a readable plot for the masses of readers. I felt this book could never appeal to a wide array of readers. Readers in their early or mid twenties would probably not relate to the characters. I seem to be a book targeted for an older group of readers.In the future, I will surely think twice before I purchase another book by Lorene Cary."
4,Solid entertaining literature,"Cary is a gifted writer with an ear for dialogue. She makes the plot move quickly without sacrificing characterization. The four women came alive on the page for me. Arneatha's response to the baby, Tamara's bitter ironies and witticisms, Roz's razor-sharp determination, Audrey's compounding losses (music, sight, father, self), all came through in Cary's careful attention to individual detail.If you want a good entertaining read that opens you up to think about the ways in which women try to keep it together while things around us change and collapse and reformulate in ways that seem too fast and too much for us to absorb, read Pride."
5,A Masterly Blend of Styles,"A seamless blend of folk, rock, and jazz, Pentangle's stunning instrumentalists manage to make the old a new and beautiful thing. Jaqui McShee has one of the most beautiful voices in popular music, John Renbourn and Bert Jansch are incredible guitarists and they work brilliantly together on this album performing some of the most melodic (remember melody?) music in pop, without ever being sappy."
3,Third-best Pentangle Album,"The sound on this CD--which is not the DVD-A version the other review trashed--is great. Sweet Child is their best album, with Pentangle second, but Basket OL boasts several great tracks--more than on subsequent albums, which had too many stiff covers of trad folk songs, and often lacked the band's trademark jazzy/bluesy approach. That said, they are all worth having for true Pentangle/Renbourn/Jansch fans."
4,Adequate,"This Santana collection primarily covers the early years of Santana's brilliant career as a band. It has many of the songs that have helped get him famous, as well as several songs from the landmark Abraxas. However, in my opinion, this is at best a meager assortment of music. It doesn't really progress beyond Abraxas, leaving the listener with only a partial taste of Carlos and his mates. You'd be much better off getting the Best of Santana alum with the ornate red corver design."
2,Album: 2/5; songs: 3/5,"What's the point of buying this album if there are so many Santana best of albums out there? This one only has 10 songs. Why bother with it?As a collection album, only 2/5 stars."
2,broken within 2 two years,"i have bought this product in Walmat,ga, it cost me more 100 dollars. it broken in 2 years with normal use,and cannot be repaired. i have bought Zarwa mp3 four years ago. it cost me about 30 dollars and it still good."
4,Great for background music,I have this cassette that I bought years ago and was so excited to see it in CD. It is create as relaxation music and I use it all the time for background music. I love this CD!
4,Haunting and strange,"I couldn't put this book down.I found it compelling-the battleground that has now become a parking lot. Period photos of battle scenes are contrasted with the same sites as they appear today.One reviewer is apparently disgusted because ""they could be your backyard"" Exactly. These pictures of old battle grounds ARE someone's backyard and thats what makes this photo-essay so amazing."
1,Run for your life!,This author has to be kidding me...! I'd be speechless if I didn't need to warn you all about this book. It's my 5-year-old's vacation pictures in print. No rhyme or reason to new/old picture combinations and next to no text.
1,A disservice to the memory of the Civil War,"I was stunned when I examined this book. There isgenerally no relation between the period photographs andthe modern photographs, which could have been taken insomeone's backyard (yours or mine!). The text is negligiblein volume and quality. Save your money for something youwill treasure for years - this book isn't it."
2,Maybe it is me.,"I have worn this type of Rockport for many years. My earlier pair was made in Portugal. This pair was made in China, of course. I had to return them. Either my left foot shrank or the left shoe was larger than the right shoe. They are well made and it broke my heart to have to return them. I guess I just have to buy shoes in the store from now on. I'd give them a five for quality but the size problem made me cut it back to two stars."
5,Good for Teacher,I'm on my feet much of the day and these are very comfortable right out of the box. No break-in required.
5,Very comfortable nice looking shoe,"These are the best shoes I have ever had in all my life. I find them even more comfortable than my tennis shoes. They also protect well from rain, snow, and work very well in all seasons. I highly recommend them."
5,Rockport Oxford Shoe,"Shoe took two days to break in, but now very comfortable. My last pair lasted for 12 years...two resoles. A great classic shoe with much comfort for your feet!"
5,Highly recommended,"Shoes arrived quickly and were more comfortable than expected. I took the advice of others and ordered one-half size smaller than I normally wear, and the fit was perfect."
2,Amazon did not do a good job; W and XW size are missing,"On this web site, there is no size of W (wide) and XW (extra wide). If you need these sizes, you have to go to other stores. Otherwise I would give it 5 or 4 stars.The best part is these shoes are waterproof.In the past Rockport shoes' front end was a curve, these shoes' front end is like a cliff. The image on this web site is not very right, may be an old photo. The old style is much better for me.The bottom worn away quickly and became totally smooth, it is very slippery in raining weather, and before too long, it was totally worn away. The shoelace worn away too soon as well."
2,Doesn't work well with my job,"For my job, I'm required to stand a lot and move around between carpet, concrete, and metal surfaces while carrying 5-25lb loads.The bottom outside edges just didn't give me the traction I needed while switching surfaces and slippery areas and I would always found myself losing my footing.The center part of the shoe did great at holding on as long as I got the entire foot down but for my day to day needs, I need to move on."
3,Not the most comfy rockports I've ever had,"I waited 3 months to hope these shoes would break in but alas, they just aren't as comfy as the rockports I had before. Maybe it's just me, but I'll go for walks at lunch for 45 minutes and by the end of the day my feet just plain hurt. I've known about my flat feet with overpronation for about 4 years, so foot pain is the usual, but these just aren't cutting it for me. I'll plan to wear actual walking or running shoes from now on for my walks. I still think these shoes might be comfortable for someone with normal feet, but they haven't worked out for me. Given my condition, I guess I""ll need to spend a little more dough for more comfortable footwear."
3,Bigger than I thought,"Received the goods for some time, the difference than I thought, but the shoes cost-effective, and my father like it."
5,Are you on your feet all day??,"I bought these shoes because I have a part time gig as a Convention Center bartender. I'm on my feet all day without the assistance of any kind of mat for cushioning. I have just three words to describe these shoes.....comfy, comfy, and comfy....Ooops, four."
5,very good quality shoes,"I love this shoes, it is worth the money I spent on them, even though the style is like a classic, s'thing that I wasn't looking for, th quality is just awesome."
4,Rockport makes good shoes,"I like this shoe it seems heavy in the picture but actually very light, comfortable, durable shoe. I suggest to anyyone especially if your job demands to be on your feet most of the time"
4,Comfortable from the first time you put them on,"These are not the kind of shoes that take a few weeks of constant wear to break in, like some other shoes. However, they do have that rubber soul that squeaks when you walk on a hard surface after coming in from the rain. Personally, I like leather soled shoes, but these are confortable and they look rather stylish. These work just fine and don't cost a bundle either. Can't really go wrong with these."
4,Solid shoe,"I just bought a pair of these from a friend who works at a shoe store. I was looking for a pair of shoes to wear to work. I have several nice pairs but they are either too dressy or uncomfortable for all day wear, everyday.I dont know much about shoes but I know Rockport is a solid brand for comfortable dress shoes. These shoes look great and are comfortable. My friend (who works at the shoe store) also said that there is a cushion on the bottom of the shoe which absorbs the impact and spreads it around the bottom when you are walking.The shoes cost me a little less than what they have advertised here and I've had them about 1 1/2 wks and I imagine they will become more comfortable the more I break them in."
4,Nice and quite confortable shoes,"These are really comfortable shoes, which could be worn on both casual and semi-formal occasions. These would go very nicely with trousers or jeans."
